  "abstract": "For any continuous self-map of a compact metric space, we consider the space of chain components and prove that the s-limit shadowing implies the denseness of chain components with the shadowing property. It gives a partial answer to a question raised by Moothathu [Topology Appl. 158 (2011) 2232--2239]. We also prove that the s-limit shadowing is not generic in the space of homeomorphisms of a closed differentiable manifold.",
