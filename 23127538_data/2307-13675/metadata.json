  "abstract": "This article investigates strong generation within the module category of a commutative Noetherian ring. We establish a criterion for such rings to possess strong generators within their module category, addressing a question raised by Iyengar and Takahashi. As a consequence, this not only demonstrates that any Noetherian quasi-excellent ring of finite Krull dimension satisfies this criterion, but applies to rings outside this class. Additionally, we identify explicit strong generators within the module category for rings of prime characteristic, and establish upper bounds on Rouquier dimension in terms of classical numerical invariants for modules.",
