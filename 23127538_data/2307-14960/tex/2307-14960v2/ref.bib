@article{Waldtmann98,
	abstract = {We study the exact low energy spectra of the spin 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on small samples of the kagom{\'e}lattice of up to N=36 sites. In agreement with the conclusions of previous authors, we find that these low energy spectra contradict the hypothesis of N{\'e}el type long range order. Certainly, the ground state of this system is a spin liquid, but its properties are rather unusual. The magnetic ({\$}{\$}({$\backslash$}Delta S = 1){\$}{\$}) excitations are separated from the ground state by a gap. However, this gap is filled with nonmagnetic ({\$}{\$}({$\backslash$}Delta S = 0){\$}{\$}) excitations. In the thermodynamic limit the spectrum of these nonmagnetic excitations will presumably develop into a gapless continuum adjacent to the ground state. Surprisingly, the eigenstates of samples with an odd number of sites, i.e. samples with an unsaturated spin, exhibit symmetries which could support long range chiral order. We do not know if these states will be true thermodynamic states or only metastable ones. In any case, the low energy properties of the spin 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagom{\'e}lattice clearly distinguish this system from either a short range RVB spin liquid or a standard chiral spin liquid. Presumably they are facets of a generically new state of frustrated two-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets.},

@article{FanGarcia_21,
	abstract = {In recent years, predictive computational modeling has become a cornerstone for the study of fundamental electronic, optical, and thermal properties in complex forms of condensed matter, including Dirac and topological materials. The simulation of quantum transport in realistic models calls for the development of linear scaling, or order-N, numerical methods, which then become enabling tools for guiding experimental research and for supporting the interpretation of measurements. In this review, we describe and compare different order-N computational methods that have been developed during the past twenty years, and which have been used extensively to explore quantum transport phenomena in disordered media. We place particular focus on the zero-frequency electrical conductivities derived within the Kubo--Greenwood and Kubo--Streda formalisms, and illustrate the capabilities of these methods to tackle the quasi-ballistic, diffusive, and localization regimes of quantum transport in the noninteracting limit. The fundamental issue of computational cost versus accuracy of various proposed numerical schemes is addressed in depth. We then illustrate the usefulness of these methods with various examples of transport in disordered materials, such as polycrystalline and defected graphene models, 3D metals and Dirac semimetals, carbon nanotubes, and organic semiconductors. Finally, we extend the review to the study of spin dynamics and topological transport, for which efficient approaches for calculating charge, spin, and valley Hall conductivities are described.},

@article{Ryu10,
	abstract = {It has recently been shown that in every spatial dimension there exist precisely five distinct classes of topological insulators or superconductors. Within a given class, the different topological sectors can be distinguished, depending on the case, by a or a topological invariant. This is an exhaustive classification. Here we construct representatives of topological insulators and superconductors for all five classes and in arbitrary spatial dimension d, in terms of Dirac Hamiltonians. Using these representatives we demonstrate how topological insulators (superconductors) in different dimensions and different classes can be related via `dimensional reduction' by compactifying one or more spatial dimensions (in `Kaluza--Klein'-like fashion). For -topological insulators (superconductors) this proceeds by descending by one dimension at a time into a different class. The -topological insulators (superconductors), on the other hand, are shown to be lower-dimensional descendants of parent -topological insulators in the same class, from which they inherit their topological properties. The eightfold periodicity in dimension d that exists for topological insulators (superconductors) with Hamiltonians satisfying at least one reality condition (arising from time-reversal or charge-conjugation/particle--hole symmetries) is a reflection of the eightfold periodicity of the spinor representations of the orthogonal groups SO(N) (a form of Bott periodicity). Furthermore, we derive for general spatial dimensions a relation between the topological invariant that characterizes topological insulators and superconductors with chiral symmetry (i.e., the winding number) and the Chern--Simons invariant. For lower-dimensional cases, this formula relates the winding number to the electric polarization (d=1 spatial dimensions) or to the magnetoelectric polarizability (d=3 spatial dimensions). Finally, we also discuss topological field theories describing the spacetime theory of linear responses in topological insulators (superconductors) and study how the presence of inversion symmetry modifies the classification of topological insulators (superconductors).},

	abstract = {In the past 20 years, impressive progress has been made both experimentally and theoretically in superconducting quantum circuits, which provide a platform for manipulating microwave photons. This emerging field of superconducting quantum microwave circuits has been driven by many new interesting phenomena in microwave photonics and quantum information processing. For instance, the interaction between superconducting quantum circuits and single microwave photons can reach the regimes of strong, ultra-strong, and even deep-strong coupling. Many higher-order effects, unusual and less familiar in traditional cavity quantum electrodynamics with natural atoms, have been experimentally observed, e.g., giant Kerr effects, multi-photon processes, and single-atom induced bistability of microwave photons. These developments may lead to improved understanding of the counterintuitive properties of quantum mechanics, and speed up applications ranging from microwave photonics to superconducting quantum information processing. In this article, we review experimental and theoretical progress in microwave photonics with superconducting quantum circuits. We hope that this global review can provide a useful roadmap for this rapidly developing field.},

@article{Fleury14,
	abstract = {The control of sound transmission is desirable in a number of circumstances from noise suppression to imaging technologies. Fleury et al. (p. 516; see the cover; see the Perspective by Cummer) studied a subwavelength acoustic meta-atom consisting of a resonant ring cavity biased by an internally circulating fluid. The direction of rotational flow of the fluid (air) changed the resonant properties of the ring cavity, allowing the propagation of sound waves within the cavity to be controlled. With several ports connected to the cavity, sound could be directed to a certain port while isolating transmission in another. Directional fluid flow is used to control and isolate the propagation of sound.  [Also see Perspective by Cummer] Acoustic isolation and nonreciprocal sound transmission are highly desirable in many practical scenarios. They may be realized with nonlinear or magneto-acoustic effects, but only at the price of high power levels and impractically large volumes. In contrast, nonreciprocal electromagnetic propagation is commonly achieved based on the Zeeman effect, or modal splitting in ferromagnetic atoms induced by a magnetic bias. Here, we introduce the acoustic analog of this phenomenon in a subwavelength meta-atom consisting of a resonant ring cavity biased by a circulating fluid. The resulting angular momentum bias splits the ring's azimuthal resonant modes, producing giant acoustic nonreciprocity in a compact device. We applied this concept to build a linear, magnetic-free circulator for airborne sound waves, observing up to 40-decibel nonreciprocal isolation at audible frequencies.},

	abstract = {The transport of sound and heat, in the form of phonons, can be limited by disorder-induced scattering. In electronic and optical settings the introduction of chiral transport, in which carrier propagation exhibits parity asymmetry, can remove elastic backscattering and provides robustness against disorder. However, suppression of disorder-induced scattering has never been demonstrated in non-topological phononic systems. Here we experimentally demonstrate a path for achieving robust phonon transport in the presence of material disorder, by explicitly inducing chirality through parity-selective optomechanical coupling. We show that asymmetric optical pumping of a symmetric resonator enables a dramatic chiral cooling of clockwise and counterclockwise phonons, while simultaneously suppressing the hidden action of disorder. Surprisingly, this passive mechanism is also accompanied by a chiral reduction in heat load leading to optical cooling of the mechanics without added damping, an effect that has no optical analog. This technique can potentially improve upon the fundamental thermal limits of resonant mechanical sensors, which cannot be attained through sideband cooling.},

	abstract = {Topological insulators are a new class of materials that exhibit robust and scatter-free transport along their edges ---independently of the fine details of the system and of the edge ---due to topological protection. To classify the topological character of two-dimensional systems without additional symmetries, one commonly uses Chern numbers, as their sum computed from all bands below a specific bandgap is equal to the net number of chiral edge modes traversing this gap. However, this is strictly valid only in settings with static Hamiltonians. The Chern numbers do not give a full characterization of the topological properties of periodically driven systems. In our work, we implement a system where chiral edge modes exist although the Chern numbers of all bands are zero. We employ periodically driven photonic waveguide lattices and demonstrate topologically protected scatter-free edge transport in such anomalous Floquet topological insulators.},

@article{Mukherjee17,
	abstract = {Topological quantum matter can be realized by subjecting engineered systems to time-periodic modulations. In analogy with static systems, periodically driven quantum matter can be topologically classified by topological invariants, whose non-zero value guarantees the presence of robust edge modes. In the high-frequency limit of the drive, topology is described by standard topological invariants, such as Chern numbers. Away from this limit, these topological numbers become irrelevant, and novel topological invariants must be introduced to capture topological edge transport. The corresponding edge modes were coined anomalous topological edge modes, to highlight their intriguing origin.

@article{WangChong09,
	abstract = {A hallmark of the quantum Hall effect, and a consequence of nontrivial topology of the electronic properties of systems manifesting this phenomenon, is the existence of so-called chiral edge states. These are a class of unique electronic states through which two-dimensional electron systems subject to a large magnetic field propagate in a unidirectional fashion, essentially unimpeded by scattering. Recent theoretical studies predicted that analogues to such electron 'one-way' edge modes could be realized for electromagnetic waves in photonic crystals, materials with periodic variations of the refractive index. Zheng Wang and colleagues now experimentally realize such photonic chiral edge states in a designed magneto-optical photonic crystal and demonstrate their unidirectional and scattering-protected nature. The finding of such photonic chiral edge states may enable new classes of photonic devices as well as new experimental realizations of the quantum Hall phenomenon in classical and bosonic systems.},

Our approach is based on the block diagonalization of the quasienergy operator in the extended Floquet Hilbert space by means of degenerate perturbation theory. The final results are equivalent to those obtained within a different approach (Rahav et al 2003 Phys. Rev. A 68 013820), (Goldman and Dalibard 2014 Phys. Rev. X 4 031027) and can also be related to the Floquet--Magnus expansion (Casas et al 2001 J. Phys. A 34 3379). We discuss that the dependence on the driving phase, which plagues the latter, can lead to artifactual symmetry breaking. The high-frequency approach is illustrated using the example of a periodically driven Hubbard model. Moreover, we discuss the nature of the approximation and its limitations for systems of many interacting particles.},

Using a combination of Bloch oscillations and Ramsey interferometry, we extract the Zak phase---the Berry phase gained during the adiabatic motion of a particle across the Brillouin zone---which can be viewed as an invariant characterizing the topological properties of the band. For a dimerized lattice, which models polyacetylene, we measure a difference of the Zak phase δφZak = 0.97(2)πfor the two possible polyacetylene phases with different dimerization. The two dimerized phases therefore belong to different topological classes, such that for a filled band, domain walls have fractional quantum numbers.

In condensed-matter systems, a wide range of phenomena stem from the geometry of the band eigenstates, which is encoded in the matrix-valued Wilson line for general multiband systems. Using an ultracold gas of rubidium atoms loaded in a honeycomb optical lattice, we realize strong-force dynamics in Bloch bands that are described by Wilson lines and observe an evolution in the band populations that directly reveals the band geometry.

@article{Duca15,
	abstract = {An electron traveling along a closed path in the momentum space of the graphene crystal lattice may not end up exactly the way it started. If its path happens to include one of the special points in momentum space, it will acquire a phase shift. Physicists can detect the signatures of this process by studying the transport properties of graphene. Duca et al. used interferometry to directly measure this so-called Berry flux in a hexagonal optical lattice, where intersecting laser beams simulate the environment that electrons experience in graphene (see the Perspective by Lamacraft). The high-precision technique may be useful in characterizing other topological structures. Science, this issue p. 288; see also p. 232 Interferometric techniques are used to measure the Berry flux in the momentum space of a hexagonal optical lattice. [Also see Perspective by Lamacraft] The geometric structure of a single-particle energy band in a solid is fundamental for a wide range of many-body phenomena and is uniquely characterized by the distribution of Berry curvature over the Brillouin zone. We realize an atomic interferometer to measure Berry flux in momentum space, in analogy to an Aharonov-Bohm interferometer that measures magnetic flux in real space. We demonstrate the interferometer for a graphene-type hexagonal optical lattice loaded with bosonic atoms. By detecting the singular π Berry flux localized at each Dirac point, we establish the high momentum resolution of this interferometric technique. Our work forms the basis for a general framework to fully characterize topological band structures.},

@article{Tokura99,
	abstract = {Magnetoelectronic features of the perovskite-type manganites are overviewed in the light of the mechanism of the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR). The essential ingredient of the CMR physics is not only the double-exchange interaction but also other competing interactions, such as ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic superexchange interactions and charge/orbital ordering instabilities as well as their strong coupling with the lattice deformation. In particular, the orbital degree of freedom of the conduction electrons in the near-degenerate 3d eg state plays an essential role in producing the unconventional metal--insulator phenomena in the manganites via strong coupling with spin, charge, and lattice degrees of freedom. Insulating or poorly conducting states arise from the long or short-range correlations of charge and orbital, but can be mostly melted or turned into the orbital-disordered conducting state by application of a magnetic field, producing the CMR or the insulator--metal transition.},

@article{Tran17,
	abstract = {Physicists demonstrate how heating a quantum system can be used as a universal probe for exotic states of matter. We reveal an intriguing manifestation of topology, which appears in the depletion rate of topological states of matter in response to an external drive. This phenomenon is presented by analyzing the response of a generic two-dimensional (2D) Chern insulator subjected to a circular time-periodic perturbation. Because of the system's chiral nature, the depletion rate is shown to depend on the orientation of the circular shake; taking the difference between the rates obtained from two opposite orientations of the drive, and integrating over a proper drive-frequency range, provides a direct measure of the topological Chern number (ν) of the populated band: This ``differential integrated rate'' is directly related to the strength of the driving field through the quantized coefficient η0 = ν/ℏ2, where h = 2π ℏ is Planck's constant. Contrary to the integer quantum Hall effect, this quantized response is found to be nonlinear with respect to the strength of the driving field, and it explicitly involves interband transitions. We investigate the possibility of probing this phenomenon in ultracold gases and highlight the crucial role played by edge states in this effect. We extend our results to 3D lattices, establishing a link between depletion rates and the nonlinear photogalvanic effect predicted for Weyl semimetals. The quantized circular dichroism revealed in this work designates depletion rate measurements as a universal probe for topological order in quantum matter.},

Recently, it was predicted that topology can also give rise to a characteristic spectroscopic response on subjecting a Chern insulator to a circular drive: comparing the frequency-integrated depletion rates associated with drives of opposite orientation leads to a quantized response dictated by the topological Chern number of the populated Bloch band4,5. Here we experimentally demonstrate this intriguing topological effect using ultracold fermionic atoms in topological Floquet bands. In addition, our depletion-rate measurements also provide an experimental estimation of the Wannier-spread functional, a fundamental geometric property of Bloch bands related to the quantum metric6,7.

	abstract = {Three-dimensional topological insulators1,2,3 represent a new quantum phase of matter with spin-polarized surface states4,5 that are protected from backscattering. The static electronic properties of these surface states have been comprehensively imaged by both photoemission4,5,6,7,8 and tunnelling9,10 spectroscopies. Theorists have proposed that topological surface states can also exhibit novel electronic responses to light, such as topological quantum phase transitions11,12,13 and spin-polarized electrical currents14,15. However, the effects of optically driving a topological insulator out of equilibrium have remained largely unexplored experimentally, and no photocurrents have been measured. Here, we show that illuminating the topological insulator Bi2Se3 with circularly polarized light generates a photocurrent that originates from topological helical Dirac fermions, and that reversing the helicity of the light reverses the direction of the photocurrent. We also observe a photocurrent that is controlled by the linear polarization of light and argue that it may also have a topological surface state origin. This approach may allow the probing of dynamic properties of topological insulators11,12,13,14,15 and lead to novel opto-spintronic devices16.},

	abstract = {The CPGE spectrum and optical conductivity in RhSi are measured and discussed, comparing to theoretical predictions. Weyl semimetals are crystals in which electron bands cross at isolated points in momentum space. Associated with each crossing point (or Weyl node) is a topological invariant known as the Berry monopole charge. The circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE), whereby circular polarized light generates a helicity-dependent photocurrent, is a notable example of a macroscopic property that emerges directly from the topology of the Weyl semimetal band structure. Recently, it was predicted that the amplitude of the CPGE associated with optical transitions near a Weyl node is proportional to its monopole charge. In chiral Weyl systems, nodes of opposite charge are nondegenerate, opening a window of wavelengths where the CPGE resulting from uncompensated Berry charge can emerge. Here, we report measurements of CPGE in the chiral Weyl semimetal RhSi, revealing a CPGE response in an energy window that closes at 0.65 eV, in agreement with the predictions of density functional theory.},

@article{Juan17,
	abstract = {The circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) is the part of a photocurrent that switches depending on the sense of circular polarization of the incident light. It has been consistently observed in systems without inversion symmetry and depends on non-universal material details. Here we find that in a class of Weyl semimetals (for example, SrSi2) and three-dimensional Rashba materials (for example, doped Te) without inversion and mirror symmetries, the injection contribution to the CPGE trace is effectively quantized in terms of the fundamental constants e, h, c and with no material-dependent parameters. This is so because the CPGE directly measures the topological charge of Weyl points, and non-quantized corrections from disorder and additional bands can be small over a significant range of incident frequencies. Moreover, the magnitude of the CPGE induced by a Weyl node is relatively large, which enables the direct detection of the monopole charge with current techniques.},

@article{Hur16,
	abstract = {We review recent developments regarding the quantum dynamics and many-body physics with light, in superconducting circuits and Josephson analogues, by analogy with atomic physics. We start with quantum impurity models addressing dissipative and driven systems. Both theorists and experimentalists are making efforts towards the characterization of these non-equilibrium quantum systems. We show how Josephson junction systems can implement the equivalent of the Kondo effect with microwave photons. The Kondo effect can be characterized by a renormalized light frequency and a peak in the Rayleigh elastic transmission of a photon. We also address the physics of hybrid systems comprising mesoscopic quantum dot devices coupled with an electromagnetic resonator. Then, we discuss extensions to Quantum Electrodynamics (QED) Networks allowing one to engineer the Jaynes--Cummings lattice and Rabi lattice models through the presence of superconducting qubits in the cavities. This opens the door to novel many-body physics with light out of equilibrium, in relation with the Mott--superfluid transition observed with ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices. Then, we summarize recent theoretical predictions for realizing topological phases with light. Synthetic gauge fields and spin--orbit couplings have been successfully implemented in quantum materials and with ultra-cold atoms in optical lattices --- using time-dependent Floquet perturbations periodic in time, for example --- as well as in photonic lattice systems. Finally, we discuss the Josephson effect related to Bose--Hubbard models in ladder and two-dimensional geometries, producing phase coherence and Meissner currents. The Bose--Hubbard model is related to the Jaynes--Cummings lattice model in the large detuning limit between light and matter (the superconducting qubits). In the presence of synthetic gauge fields, we show that Meissner currents subsist in an insulating Mott phase.

@article{Hafezi11,
	abstract = {Phenomena associated with the topological properties of physical systems can be naturally robust against perturbations. This robustness is exemplified by quantized conductance and edge state transport in the quantum Hall and quantum spin Hall effects. Here we show how exploiting topological properties of optical systems can be used to improve photonic devices. We demonstrate how quantum spin Hall Hamiltonians can be created with linear optical elements using a network of coupled resonator optical waveguides (CROW) in two dimensions. We find that key features of quantum Hall systems, including the characteristic Hofstadter butterfly and robust edge state transport, can be obtained in such systems. As a specific application, we show that topological protection can be used to improve the performance of optical delay lines and to overcome some limitations related to disorder in photonic technologies.},

@article{Hartmann16,
	abstract = {Enhancing optical nonlinearities so that they become appreciable on the single photon level and lead to nonclassical light fields has been a central objective in quantum optics for many years. After this has been achieved in individual micro-cavities representing an effectively zero-dimensional volume, this line of research has shifted its focus towards engineering devices where such strong optical nonlinearities simultaneously occur in extended volumes of multiple nodes of a network. Recent technological progress in several experimental platforms now opens the possibility to employ the systems of strongly interacting photons, these give rise to as quantum simulators. Here we review the recent development and current status of this research direction for theory and experiment. Addressing both, optical photons interacting with atoms and microwave photons in networks of superconducting circuits, we focus on analogue quantum simulations in scenarios where effective photon-photon interactions exceed dissipative processes in the considered platforms.},

@article{Schneider12,
	abstract = {Transport properties are among the defining characteristics of many important phases in condensed-matter physics. In the presence of strong correlations they are difficult to predict, even for model systems such as the Hubbard model. In real materials, additional complications arise owing to impurities, lattice defects or multi-band effects. Ultracold atoms in contrast offer the possibility to study transport and out-of-equilibrium phenomena in a clean and well-controlled environment and can therefore act as a quantum simulator for condensed-matter systems. Here we studied the expansion of an initially confined fermionic quantum gas in the lowest band of a homogeneous optical lattice. For non-interacting atoms, we observe ballistic transport, but even small interactions render the expansion almost bimodal, with a dramatically reduced expansion velocity. The dynamics is independent of the sign of the interaction, revealing a novel, dynamic symmetry of the Hubbard model.},

@article{Anderson95,
	abstract = {A Bose-Einstein condensate was produced in a vapor of rubidium-87 atoms that was confined by magnetic fields and evaporatively cooled. The condensate fraction first appeared near a temperature of 170 nanokelvin and a number density of 2.5 × 1012 per cubic centimeter and could be preserved for more than 15 seconds. Three primary signatures of Bose-Einstein condensation were seen. (i) On top of a broad thermal velocity distribution, a narrow peak appeared that was centered at zero velocity. (ii) The fraction of the atoms that were in this low-velocity peak increased abruptly as the sample temperature was lowered. (iii) The peak exhibited a nonthermal, anisotropic velocity distribution expected of the minimum-energy quantum state of the magnetic trap in contrast to the isotropic, thermal velocity distribution observed in the broad uncondensed fraction.},

@article{Hubbard63,
	abstract = { It is pointed out that one of the main effects of correlation phenomena in d- and f-bands is to give rise to behaviour characteristic of the atomic or Heitler-London model. To investigate this situation a simple, approximate model for the interaction of electrons in narrow energy bands is introduced. The results of applying the Hartree-Fock approximation to this model are examined. Using a Green function technique an approximate solution of the correlation problem for this model is obtained. This solution has the property of reducing to the exact atomic solution in the appropriate limit and to the ordinary uncorrelated band picture in the opposite limit. The condition for ferromagnetism of this solution is discussed. To clarify the physical meaning of the solution a two-electron example is examined. },

	abstract = {After introducing the field of Highly Frustrated Magnetism through the quest for a quantum spin liquid in dimension higher than one, we focus on the emblematic case of the kagome network. From a theoretical point of view, the simple Heisenberg case for an antiferromagnetic kagome lattice decorated with quantum spins has been a long-standing problem, not solved yet. Experimental realizations have remained scarce for long until the discovery of herbertsmithite ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2 in 2005. This is one of the very few quantum kagome spin liquid candidates that triggered a burst of activity both on theory and experiment sides. We give a survey of theory outcomes on the ``kagome'' problem, review the experimental properties of that model candidate and shortly discuss them with respect to recent theoretical results.

	abstract = {A kagome lattice of 3d transition metal ions is a versatile platform for correlated topological phases hosting symmetry-protected electronic excitations and magnetic ground states. However, the paradigmatic states of the idealized two-dimensional kagome lattice---Dirac fermions and flat bands---have not been simultaneously observed. Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and de Haas--van Alphen quantum oscillations to reveal coexisting surface and bulk Dirac fermions as well as flat bands in the antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeSn, which has spatially decoupled kagome planes. Our band structure calculations and matrix element simulations demonstrate that the bulk Dirac bands arise from in-plane localized Fe-3d orbitals, and evidence that the coexisting Dirac surface state realizes a rare example of fully spin-polarized two-dimensional Dirac fermions due to spin-layer locking in FeSn. The prospect to harness these prototypical excitations in a kagome lattice is a frontier of great promise at the confluence of topology, magnetism and strongly correlated physics.},

By using the topological winding properties of the spin-edge states on the complex-energy Riemann surface, the spin Hall conductance is obtained to be quantized as −e/2π (e/2π) in insulating phases. This result is consistent with the numerical linear-response calculation and the Z2 topological invariance analysis. When the sample boundaries are connected in twist, by which two defects with π flux are introduced, we obtain the spin-charge separated solitons at 1/3 (or 2/3) filling.},

We include an additional staggered lattice potential and an artificial Rashba-type spin--orbit coupling term available in experiment. Without interactions, the system can be either a (semi)-metal, a normal or a topological insulator, and we present the non-Abelian generalization of the Hofstadter butterfly. Using a combination of real-space dynamical mean-field theory (RDMFT), analytical arguments, and Monte-Carlo simulations we study the effect of strong on-site interactions. We determine the interacting phase diagram, and discuss a scenario of an interaction-induced transition from a normal to a topological insulator. At half-filling and large interactions, the system is described by a quantum spin Hamiltonian, which exhibits exotic magnetic order due to the interplay of Rashba-type spin--orbit coupling and the artificial time-reversal-invariant magnetic field term. We determine the magnetic phase diagram: both for the itinerant model using RDMFT and for the corresponding spin model in the classical limit using Monte-Carlo simulations.},

	abstract = {Quantum spin-1/2 kagome Heisenberg antiferromagnet is the representative frustrated system possibly hosting a spin liquid. Clarifying the nature of this elusive topological phase is a key challenge in condensed matter; however, even identifying it still remains unsettled. Here we apply a magnetic field and discover a series of spin-gapped phases appearing at five different fractions of magnetization by means of a grand canonical density matrix renormalization group, an unbiased state-of-the-art numerical technique. The magnetic field dopes magnons and first gives rise to a possible Z3 spin liquid plateau at 1/9 magnetization. Higher field induces a self-organized super-lattice unit, a six-membered ring of quantum spins, resembling an atomic orbital structure. Putting magnons into this unit one by one yields three quantum solid plateaus. We thus find that the magnetic field could control the transition between various emergent phases by continuously releasing the frustration.},

	abstract = {Topological insulators have Dirac cone surface states protected by time-reversal symmetry (TRS). Weak magnetic order in topological insulator thin films can lead to the quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE), which was first realized by magnetic doping of topological insulators to establish a fragile ferromagnetic state. Recent work has established MnBi2Te4 as a structurally ordered magnetic topological insulator. We report on a theoretical study of superlattices formed from MnBi2Te4 and Bi2Te3 building blocks that employs a simplified model validated by ab initio density-functional theory. We use it to shed light on the dependence of the quantum anomalous Hall effect on film thickness, magnetic configuration, the stacking sequences of the van der Waals coupled building blocks, and bulk electronic structure. We discuss the magnetic and topological properties of bulk crystals and quasi--two-dimensional (quasi-2D) thin films formed by stacking intrinsic magnetized topological insulator (for example, Mn (SbxBi1−x)2X4 with X = Se,Te) septuple layers and topological insulator quintuple layers in arbitrary order. Our analysis makes use of a simplified model that retains only Dirac cone degrees of freedom on both surfaces of each septuple or quintuple layer. We demonstrate the model's applicability and estimate its parameters by comparing with ab initio density-functional theory (DFT) calculations. We then employ the coupled Dirac cone model to provide an explanation for the dependence of thin-film properties, particularly the presence or absence of the quantum anomalous Hall effect, on film thickness, magnetic configuration, and stacking arrangement, and to comment on the design of Weyl superlattices.},

	abstract = {We report a comprehensive neutron scattering study on the spin excitations in the magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2 with a quasi-two-dimensional structure. Both in-plane and out-of-plane dispersions of the spin waves were revealed in the ferromagnetic state. Similarly, dispersive but damped spin excitations were found in the paramagnetic state. The effective exchange interactions were estimated using a semi-classical Heisenberg model to consistently reproduce the experimental TC and spin stiffness. However, a full spin wave gap below Eg = 2.3 meV was observed at T = 4 K. This value was considerably larger than the estimated magnetic anisotropy energy (\~{}0.6 meV), and its temperature dependence indicated a significant contribution from the Weyl fermions. These results suggest that Co3Sn2S2 is a three-dimensional correlated system with a large spin stiffness, and the low-energy spin dynamics can interplay with the topological electron states.},

@article{LiuLiang19,
	abstract = {Weyl semimetals (WSMs)---materials that host exotic quasiparticles called Weyl fermions---must break either spatial inversion or time-reversal symmetry. A number of WSMs that break inversion symmetry have been identified, but showing unambiguously that a material is a time-reversal-breaking WSM is tricky. Three groups now provide spectroscopic evidence for this latter state in magnetic materials (see the Perspective by da Silva Neto). Belopolski et al. probed the material Co2MnGa using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, revealing exotic drumhead surface states. Using the same technique, Liu et al. studied the material Co3Sn2S2, which was complemented by the scanning tunneling spectroscopy measurements of Morali et al. These magnetic WSM states provide an ideal setting for exotic transport effects. Science, this issue p. 1278, p. 1282, p. 1286; see also p. 1248 Photoemission and scanning tunneling spectroscopies provide direct evidence for the existence of magnetic Weyl semimetals. Weyl semimetals are crystalline solids that host emergent relativistic Weyl fermions and have characteristic surface Fermi-arcs in their electronic structure. Weyl semimetals with broken time reversal symmetry are difficult to identify unambiguously. In this work, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we visualized the electronic structure of the ferromagnetic crystal Co3Sn2S2 and discovered its characteristic surface Fermi-arcs and linear bulk band dispersions across the Weyl points.

@article{Nakatsuji15,
	abstract = {The Hall effect as it is commonly encountered describes the voltage difference that builds up across a conductor when an electric current flows in the presence of a magnetic field. For ferromagnetic materials, with built-in magnetism, a similar phenomenon ---known as the anomalous Hall effect ---is sometimes observed even in the absence of an external magnetic field. Such an effect would not normally be expected for antiferromagnets, which have no net magnetization in the zero-field state. Inspired by recent theoretical ideas concerning the detailed origins of the anomalous Hall effect, Satoru Nakatsuji et al. show that such a counterintuitive effect can be seen in the antiferromagnetic material Mn3Sn as a consequence of the unusual and complex arrangement of its constituent magnetic moments. The effect is not only large (comparable to that of ferromagnetic metals) but easily switchable with a small applied field ---a combination of properties that might prove useful for spintronic applications.},

@article{XuBelopolski15,
	abstract = {Weyl fermions---massless particles with half-integer spin---were once mistakenly thought to describe neutrinos. Although not yet observed among elementary particles, Weyl fermions may exist as collective excitations in so-called Weyl semimetals. These materials have an unusual band structure in which the linearly dispersing valence and conduction bands meet at discrete ``Weyl points.'' Xu et al. used photoemission spectroscopy to identify TaAs as a Weyl semimetal capable of hosting Weyl fermions. In a complementary study, Lu et al. detected the characteristic Weyl points in a photonic crystal. The observation of Weyl physics may enable the discovery of exotic fundamental phenomena. Science, this issue p. 613 and 622 Angle-resolved photoemission is used to detect the topological surface states and bulk dispersion of the compound tantalum arsenide. [Also see Report by Lu et al.] A Weyl semimetal is a new state of matter that hosts Weyl fermions as emergent quasiparticles and admits a topological classification that protects Fermi arc surface states on the boundary of a bulk sample. This unusual electronic structure has deep analogies with particle physics and leads to unique topological properties. We report the experimental discovery of a Weyl semimetal, tantalum arsenide (TaAs). Using photoemission spectroscopy, we directly observe Fermi arcs on the surface, as well as the Weyl fermion cones and Weyl nodes in the bulk of TaAs single crystals. We find that Fermi arcs terminate on the Weyl fermion nodes, consistent with their topological character. Our work opens the field for the experimental study of Weyl fermions in physics and materials science.},

@article{Essafi16,
	abstract = {Despite its deceptive simplicity, few concepts have more fundamental implications than chirality, from the therapeutic activity of drugs to the fundamental forces of nature. In magnetic materials, chirality gives rise to unconventional phenomena such as the anomalous Hall effect and multiferroicity, taking an enhanced flavour in the so-called spin-liquid phases where magnetic disorder prevails. Kagome systems sit at the crossroad of these ideas. Motivated by the recent synthesis of rare-earth kagome materials and the progresses in optical-lattice experiments, we bring together an entire network of spin liquids with anisotropic and Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interactions. This network revolves around the Ising antiferromagnet and ends on (ferromagnetic) chiral spin liquids with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry. As for the celebrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet, it now belongs to a triad of equivalently disordered phases. The present work provides a unifying theory of kagome spin liquids with time-reversal invariant nearest-neighbour Hamiltonians.},

	abstract = {Numerical calculations reveal that the true ground state of a frustrated two-dimensional system is a gapped spin liquid. We use the density matrix renormalization group to perform accurate calculations of the ground state of the nearest-neighbor quantum spin S = 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagome lattice. We study this model on numerous long cylinders with circumferences up to 12 lattice spacings. Through a combination of very-low-energy and small finite-size effects, our results provide strong evidence that, for the infinite two-dimensional system, the ground state of this model is a fully gapped spin liquid.},

@article{LiuLiuXu22,
	abstract = {The spin--orbit coupling (SOC) lifts the band degeneracy that plays a vital role in the search for different topological states, such as topological insulators (TIs) and topological semimetals (TSMs). In TSMs, the SOC can partially gap a degenerate nodal line, leading to the formation of Dirac/Weyl semimetals (DSMs/WSMs). However, such SOC-induced gap structure along the nodal line in TSMs has not yet been systematically investigated experimentally. Here, we report a direct observation of such gap structure in a magnetic WSM Co3Sn2S2 using high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Our results not only reveal the existence and importance of the strong SOC effect in the formation of the WSM phase in Co3Sn2S2, but also provide insights for the understanding of its exotic physical properties.},

@article{YinMa20,
	abstract = {The quantum-level interplay between geometry, topology and correlation is at the forefront of fundamental physics1--15. Kagome magnets are predicted to support intrinsic Chern quantum phases owing to their unusual lattice geometry and breaking of time-reversal symmetry14,15. However, quantum materials hosting ideal spin--orbit-coupled kagome lattices with strong out-of-plane magnetization are lacking16--21. Here, using scanning tunnelling microscopy, we identify a new topological kagome magnet, TbMn6Sn6, that is close to satisfying these criteria. We visualize its effectively defect-free, purely manganese-based ferromagnetic kagome lattice with atomic resolution. Remarkably, its electronic state shows distinct Landau quantization on application of a magnetic field, and the quantized Landau fan structure features spin-polarized Dirac dispersion with a large Chern gap. We further demonstrate the bulk--boundary correspondence between the Chern gap and the topological edge state, as well as the Berry curvature field correspondence of Chern gapped Dirac fermions. Our results point to the realization of a quantum-limit Chern phase in TbMn6Sn6, and may enable the observation of topological quantum phenomena in the RMn6Sn6 (where R is a rare earth element) family with a variety of magnetic structures. Our visualization of the magnetic bulk--boundary--Berry correspondence covering real space and momentum space demonstrates a proof-of-principle method for revealing topological magnets.},

Many theoretical predictions critically depend on the number of valleys where the Dirac fermions are realized. We now report the discovery of a two-dimensional system with a single, spin-degenerate Dirac valley. We study the transport properties of HgTe quantum wells grown at a critical thickness where the band gap vanishes. In a magnetic field, we observe quantum Hall plateaux that exhibit the anomalous sequence characteristic of Dirac systems. The filling factors at which the plateaux occur are direct evidence of the presence of a single Dirac valley in the system. Also the conductivity at the Dirac point and its temperature dependence can be understood from single valley Dirac fermion physics. Our observations pave the way to study quantum interference and ballistic transport phenomena of Dirac fermions, which so far have been hard to access.},

	abstract = {The prediction and experimental verification of the quantum spin Hall state marked the discovery of a new state of matter now known as topological insulators. Two-dimensional topological insulators exhibit the quantum spin-Hall effect, characterized by gapless spin-polarized counter-propagating edge channels. Whereas the helical character of these edge channels is now well established, experimental confirmation that the transport in the edge channels is spin polarized is still outstanding. We report experiments on nanostructures fabricated from HgTe quantum wells with an inverted band structure, in which a split gate technique allows us to combine both quantum spin Hall and metallic spin Hall transport in a single device. In these devices, the quantum spin Hall effect can be used as a spin current injector and detector for the metallic spin Hall effect, and vice versa, allowing for an all-electrical detection of spin polarization.},

	abstract = {Recent theory predicted that the quantum spin Hall effect, a fundamentally new quantum state of matter that exists at zero external magnetic field, may be realized in HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te quantum wells. We fabricated such sample structures with low density and high mobility in which we could tune, through an external gate voltage, the carrier conduction from n-type to p-type, passing through an insulating regime. For thin quantum wells with well width d \&lt; 6.3 nanometers, the insulating regime showed the conventional behavior of vanishingly small conductance at low temperature. However, for thicker quantum wells (d \&gt; 6.3 nanometers), the nominally insulating regime showed a plateau of residual conductance close to 2e2/h, where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant. The residual conductance was independent of the sample width, indicating that it is caused by edge states. Furthermore, the residual conductance was destroyed by a small external magnetic field. The quantum phase transition at the critical thickness, d = 6.3 nanometers, was also independently determined from the magnetic field--induced insulator-to-metal transition. These observations provide experimental evidence of the quantum spin Hall effect.},

Reduced to the case of a non-interacting system, the θ invariant can be expressed as an integral over the entire three-dimensional Brillouin zone. Alternatively, non-interacting insulators can be classified by topological invariants defined over discrete TR invariant momenta. In this paper, we show the complete equivalence between the integral and the discrete invariants of the topological insulator.},

@article{Chang13,
	abstract = {The Hall effect, an electromagnetic phenomenon with a straightforward explanation, has many exotic counterparts, including a quantized version occurring independently of the presence of external magnetic fields. Inspired by a theoretical prediction of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in magnetically doped topological insulator thin films, Chang et al. (p. 167, published online 14 March; see the Perspective by Oh) prepared thin films of the compound Cr0.15(Bi0.1Sb0.9)1.85Te3, with Cr as the magnetic dopant. They observed a plateau in the Hall resistance as a function of the gating voltage without any applied magnetic fields, signifying the achievement of the QAH state. An elusive effect emerges in thin films of a bismuth-antimony-telluride topological insulator doped with magnetic chromium. [Also see Perspective by Oh] The quantized version of the anomalous Hall effect has been predicted to occur in magnetic topological insulators, but the experimental realization has been challenging. Here, we report the observation of the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in thin films of chromium-doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3, a magnetic topological insulator. At zero magnetic field, the gate-tuned anomalous Hall resistance reaches the predicted quantized value of h/e2, accompanied by a considerable drop in the longitudinal resistance. Under a strong magnetic field, the longitudinal resistance vanishes, whereas the Hall resistance remains at the quantized value. The realization of the QAH effect may lead to the development of low-power-consumption electronics.},

@article{Greiner02,
	abstract = {For a system at a temperature of absolute zero, all thermal fluctuations are frozen out, while quantum fluctuations prevail. These microscopic quantum fluctuations can induce a macroscopic phase transition in the ground state of a many-body system when the relative strength of two competing energy terms is varied across a critical value. Here we observe such a quantum phase transition in a Bose--Einstein condensate with repulsive interactions, held in a three-dimensional optical lattice potential. As the potential depth of the lattice is increased, a transition is observed from a superfluid to a Mott insulator phase. In the superfluid phase, each atom is spread out over the entire lattice, with long-range phase coherence. But in the insulating phase, exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites, with no phase coherence across the lattice; this phase is characterized by a gap in the excitation spectrum. We can induce reversible changes between the two ground states of the system.},

@article{Jordens08,
	abstract = {In a Mott insulator, suppression of conductivity occurs as a result of electron interactions. Proximity to this phase causes intriguing phenomena in fermionic condensed matter systems, most notably high-temperature superconductivity. The Hubbard model, which encompasses the essential physics of the Mott insulator, can be realized with quantum gases trapped in an optical lattice. Therefore, experimental tools developed in atomic physics can be used to study this regime. However, an atomic Mott insulator has so far been realized only with a gas of bosons, which lack the rich and peculiar nature of fermions. The authors report the formation of a Mott insulator of a repulsively interacting two-component Fermi gas in an optical lattice. The results pave the way for further studies of the Mott insulator, including spin-ordering and ultimately the question of d-wave superfluidity.},

	abstract = {The fermionic Hubbard model plays a fundamental role in the description of strongly correlated materials. We have realized this Hamiltonian in a repulsively interacting spin mixture of ultracold 40K atoms in a three-dimensional (3D) optical lattice. Using in situ imaging and independent control of external confinement and lattice depth, we were able to directly measure the compressibility of the quantum gas in the trap. Together with a comparison to ab initio dynamical mean field theory calculations, we show how the system evolves for increasing confinement from a compressible dilute metal over a strongly interacting Fermi liquid into a band-insulating state. For strong interactions, we find evidence for an emergent incompressible Mott insulating phase. This demonstrates the potential to model interacting condensed-matter systems using ultracold fermionic atoms.},

@article{Berry84,
	abstract = {A quantal system in an eigenstate, slowly transported round a circuit C by varying parameters R in its Hamiltonian {\^H}(R), will acquire a geometrical phase factor exp iγ(C) in addition to the familiar dynamical phase factor. An explicit general formula for γ(C) is derived in terms of the spectrum and eigenstates of {\^H}(R) over a surface spanning C. If C lies near a degeneracy of {\^H}, γ(C) takes a simple form which includes as a special case the sign change of eigenfunctions of real symmetric matrices round a degeneracy. As an illustration γ(C) is calculated for spinning particles in slowly-changing magnetic fields; although the sign reversal of spinors on rotation is a special case, the effect is predicted to occur for bosons as well as fermions, and a method for observing it is proposed. It is shown that the Aharonov-Bohm effect can be interpreted as a geometrical phase factor.},

However, in systems of ultracold neutral atoms, there is no coupling between the spin and the centre-of-mass motion of the atom. Lin et al. use lasers to engineer such spin-orbit coupling in a neutral atomic Bose--Einstein condensate, the first time this has been achieved for any bosonic system.

The spin Hall effect can be used for manipulating photonic angular momentum states, and the measurement technique holds promise for precision metrology.},

We analytically show that for a one-dimensional, ring-shaped setup the coupling of the impurities to the Bogoliubov phonons of the condensate leads to a non-trivial phase in the impurity hopping. The presence of this phase can be tested by observing a drift in the transport properties of the impurities. These results are quantitatively confirmed by a numerically exact simulation of a two-mode Bose-Hubbard model. We also give analytical expressions for the occurring phase terms for a two-dimensional setup. The phase realises an artificial magnetic field and can, for instance, be used for the simulation of the quantum Hall effect using atoms in an optical lattice.},

Called quasiparticles, these excitations can themselves condense into new liquid states. Each such liquid is characterized by a fractional quantum number that is directly observable in a simple electrical measurement. This article attempts to convey the qualitative essence of this still unfolding phenomenon, known as the fractional quantum Hall effect.},

	abstractnote = {The interplay between electronic correlations and topological protection may offer a rich avenue for discovering emergent quantum phenomena in condensed matter. However, electronic correlations have so far been little investigated in Weyl semimetals (WSMs) by experiments. Here, we report a combined optical spectroscopy and theoretical calculation study on the strength and effect of electronic correlations in a magnet Co3Sn2S2. The electronic kinetic energy estimated from our optical data is about half of that obtained from single-particle ab initio calculations in the ferromagnetic ground state, which indicates intermediate-strength electronic correlations in this system. Furthermore, comparing the energy and side-slope ratios between the interband-transition peaks at high energies in the experimental and single-particle-calculation-derived optical conductivity spectra with the bandwidth-renormalization factors obtained by many-body calculations enables us to estimate the Coulomb-interaction strength (U ~ 4 eV) in Co3Sn2S2. Besides, a sharp experimental optical conductivity peak at low energy, which is absent in the single-particle-calculation-derived spectrum but is consistent with the optical conductivity peaks obtained by many-body calculations with U ~ 4 eV, indicates that an electronic band connecting the two Weyl cones is flattened by electronic correlations and emerges near the Fermi energy in Co3Sn2S2. Our work paves the way for exploring flat-band-generated quantum phenomena in WSMs.},

This transition goes with a change in topological invariant, and is accompanied by a nontopological transition from saturated ferromagnetic to paramagnetic state, the minority Fermi surface being transformed from ghost (hidden) to real. A corresponding description is given in terms of slave fermion representation for the effective narrow-band Hubbard model. The system Co3Sn2S2 provides a bright example of coexistence of nontrivial topology and strong low-dimensional ferromagnetism. Comparison is performed with other compounds where frustrations result in formation of a correlated paramagnetic state.},

	abstract = {Magnetic topological semimetals (TSMs) are topological quantum materials with broken time-reversal symmetry (TRS) and isolated nodal points or lines near the Fermi level. Their topological properties would typically reveal from the bulk-edge correspondence principle as nontrivial surface states such as Fermi arcs or drumhead states, etc. Depending on the degeneracies and distribution of the nodes in the crystal momentum space, TSMs are usually classified into Weyl semimetals (WSMs), Dirac semimetals (DSMs), nodal-line semimetals (NLSMs), triple-point semimetals (TPSMs), etc. In this review article, we present the recent advances of magnetic TSMs from a computational perspective. We first review the early predicted magnetic WSMs such as pyrochlore iridates and HgCr2Se4, as well as the recently proposed Heusler, Kagome layers, and honeycomb lattice WSMs. Then we discuss the recent developments of magnetic DSMs, especially CuMnAs in Type-III and EuCd2As2 in Type-IV magnetic space groups (MSGs). Then we introduce some magnetic NLSMs that are robust against spin--orbit coupling (SOC), namely Fe3GeTe2 and LaCl (LaBr). Finally, we discuss the prospects of magnetic TSMs and the interesting directions for future research.},

@article{Wang18,
	abstract = {The origin of anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in magnetic materials is one of the most intriguing aspects in condensed matter physics and has been a controversial topic for a long time. Recent studies indicate that the intrinsic AHE is closely related to the Berry curvature of occupied electronic states. In a magnetic Weyl semimetal with broken time-reversal symmetry, there are significant contributions to Berry curvature around Weyl nodes, possibly leading to a large intrinsic AHE. Here, we report the quite large AHE in the half-metallic ferromagnet Co3Sn2S2 single crystal. By systematically mapping out the electronic structure of Co3Sn2S2 both theoretically and experimentally, we demonstrate that the intrinsic AHE from the Weyl fermions near the Fermi energy is dominating. The intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity depends linearly on the magnetization and can be reproduced by theoretical simulation, in which the Weyl nodes monotonically move with the constrained magnetic moment on Co atom.},

It is this irreversibility that leads to intrinsic dissipations in electronic devices and limits the possibility of quantum computation. We theoretically predict that the electric field can induce a substantial amount of dissipationless quantum spin current at room temperature, in hole-doped semiconductors such as Si, Ge, and GaAs. On the basis of a generalization of the quantum Hall effect, the predicted effect leads to efficient spin injection without the need for metallic ferromagnets. Principles found here could enable quantum spintronic devices with integrated information processing and storage units, operating with low power consumption and performing reversible quantum computation.},

We explainhow the polarization is closely related to a Berry phase of the Bloch wavefunctions asthe wavevector is carried across the Brillouin zone, or equivalently, to the centers ofcharge of Wannier functions constructed from the Bloch wavefunctions. A resultingfeature of this formulation is that the polarization is formally defined only modulo a``quantum of polarization'' -- in other words, that the polarization may be regardedas a multi-valued quantity. We discuss the consequences of this theory for thephysical understanding of ferroelectric materials, including polarization reversal,piezoelectric effects, and the appearance of polarization charges at surfacesand interfaces. In so doing, we give a few examples of realistic calculationsof polarization-related quantities in perovskite ferroelectrics, illustratinghow the present approach provides a robust and powerful foundation formodern computational studies of dielectric and ferroelectric materials. },

Along these lines, several kagome magnets have appeared as the most promising platforms. Here, we explore magnetic correlations in the kagome magnet Co3Sn2S2. Using muon spin-rotation, we present evidence for competing magnetic orders in the kagome lattice of this compound. Our results show that while the sample exhibits an out-of-plane ferromagnetic ground state, an in-plane antiferromagnetic state appears at temperatures above 90{\thinspace}K, eventually attaining a volume fraction of 80{\%} around 170{\thinspace}K, before reaching a non-magnetic state. Strikingly, the reduction of the anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC) above 90{\thinspace}K linearly follows the disappearance of the volume fraction of the ferromagnetic state. We further show that the competition of these magnetic phases is tunable through applying either an external magnetic field or hydrostatic pressure. Our results taken together suggest the thermal and quantum tuning of Berry curvature induced AHC via external tuning of magnetic order.},

	abstract = {Magnetic Weyl semimetals with broken time-reversal symmetry are expected to generate strong intrinsic anomalous Hall effects, due to their large Berry curvature. Here, we report a magnetic Weyl semimetal candidate, Co3Sn2S2, with a quasi-two-dimensional crystal structure consisting of stacked kagome lattices. This lattice provides an excellent platform for hosting exotic topological quantum states. We observe a negative magnetoresistance that is consistent with the chiral anomaly expected from the presence of Weyl fermions close to the Fermi level. The anomalous Hall conductivity is robust against both increased temperature and charge conductivity, which corroborates the intrinsic Berry-curvature mechanism in momentum space. Owing to the low carrier density in this material and the considerably enhanced Berry curvature from its band structure, the anomalous Hall conductivity and the anomalous Hall angle simultaneously reach 1,130{\thinspace}$\Omega$−1{\thinspace}cm−1 and 20{\%}, respectively, an order of magnitude larger than typical magnetic systems. Combining the kagome-lattice structure and the long-range out-of-plane ferromagnetic order of Co3Sn2S2, we expect that this material is an excellent candidate for observation of the quantum anomalous Hall state in the two-dimensional limit.},

In particular the width oscillates over different orders of magnitude as the field changes slightly. The oscillations are a consequence of a resonance phenomenon.},

@article{Rauh74,
	abstract = {Abstract A group-theoretical analysis is given of the eigenstates of a charged particle when a magnetic field and a periodic potential are simultaneously present. The field is assumed totally or partially irrational with respect to the crystalline structure. The representations of the magnetic translation group are generated from free electron Landau states for convenience, but no discrepancies with the Frobenius method arise. The results are as follows: if H is parallel to a lattice direction, k · H is a good quantum number; otherwise, k · H may be assigned a fixed value for all members of a representation but is not numerically unique. According to group theory, there is a fixed finite δk⊥ which separates members of the same representation, and hence, equal energy. However, consideration of the energy matrix shows that there is complete degeneracy in ky for totally irrational fields; this case is thus close to the case of free electrons. In the cases intermediate between zero and totally irrational field boundary conditions may be crucial for the energy spectrum, as illustrated by an example.},

The bulk energy bands split into subbands near the surface forming a two-dimensional electron (hole) gas. A self-consistent formulation of the problem is given in the form of coupled Schr{\"o}dinger and Poisson equations. A review of approximate results of simple limiting cases is given. The condition of surface semiconductor layer in applied magnetic field, causing Landau levels, is discussed. The analogy of the quantum size effect in thin semiconductor films to the quantum effect in the surface layer is outlined. A number of experimental techniques, as magnetoconductivity (Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations), Hall effect, capacitance, magnetocapacitance, piezoresistance, tunneling, and photoresponse measurements were carried out to verify the surface quantization in inversion and accumulation layers of silicon and other semiconductors from the low temperature region up to room temperatures.},

@article{Zhang05,
	abstract = {When electrons are confined in two-dimensional materials, quantum-mechanically enhanced transport phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect can be observed. Graphene, consisting of an isolated single atomic layer of graphite, is an ideal realization of such a two-dimensional system. However, its behaviour is expected to differ markedly from the well-studied case of quantum wells in conventional semiconductor interfaces. This difference arises from the unique electronic properties of graphene, which exhibits electron--hole degeneracy and vanishing carrier mass near the point of charge neutrality1,2. Indeed, a distinctive half-integer quantum Hall effect has been predicted3,4,5 theoretically, as has the existence of a non-zero Berry's phase (a geometric quantum phase) of the electron wavefunction---a consequence of the exceptional topology of the graphene band structure6,7. Recent advances in micromechanical extraction and fabrication techniques for graphite structures8,9,10,11,12 now permit such exotic two-dimensional electron systems to be probed experimentally. Here we report an experimental investigation of magneto-transport in a high-mobility single layer of graphene. Adjusting the chemical potential with the use of the electric field effect, we observe an unusual half-integer quantum Hall effect for both electron and hole carriers in graphene. The relevance of Berry's phase to these experiments is confirmed by magneto-oscillations. In addition to their purely scientific interest, these unusual quantum transport phenomena may lead to new applications in carbon-based electronic and magneto-electronic devices.},

	abstract = {THE synthesis of molecular carbon structures in the form of C60 and other fullerenes has stimulated intense interest in the structures accessible to graphitic carbon sheets. Here I report the preparation of a new type of finite carbon structure consisting of needle-like tubes. Produced using an arc-discharge evaporation method similar to that used for fullerene synthesis, the needles grow at the negative end of the electrode used for the arc discharge. Electron microscopy reveals that each needle comprises coaxial tubes of graphitic sheets, ranging in number from 2 up to about 50. On each tube the  carbon-atom hexagons are arranged in a helical fashion about the needle axis. The helical pitch varies from needle to needle and from tube to tube  within a single needle. It appears that this helical structure may aid the growth process. The formation of these needles, ranging from a few to a few tens of nanometres in diameter, suggests that engineering of carbon structures should be possible on scales considerably greater than those relevant to the fullerenes.},

In particular, by measuring the unbalance current with a cryogenic current comparator, it has been possible to compare the four quantum resistances constituting the Wheatstone bridge with a relative uncertainty, never achieved so far, of 8 parts in 1011. This work shows not only the efficiency of the multiple connection technique but also the interest of a QHE Wheatstone bridge made of Hall bars of different natures to realize QHE universality tests with attainable accuracies as low as some parts in 1012. The verification of the QHE universality property with a relative uncertainty one order of magnitude lower than that of the previous universality tests should support, as recommended by the Comit{\'e} International des Poids et Mesures, the redefinition of the Syst{\`e}me International of units based on the fundamental constants of physics. },

	abstract = {Graphene is a rapidly rising star on the horizon of materials science and condensed-matter physics. This strictly two-dimensional material exhibits exceptionally high crystal and electronic quality, and, despite its short history, has already revealed a cornucopia of new physics and potential applications, which are briefly discussed here. Whereas one can be certain of the realness of applications only when commercial products appear, graphene no longer requires any further proof of its importance in terms of fundamental physics. Owing to its unusual electronic spectrum, graphene has led to the emergence of a new paradigm of 'relativistic' condensed-matter physics, where quantum relativistic phenomena, some of which are unobservable in high-energy physics, can now be mimicked and tested in table-top experiments. More generally, graphene represents a conceptually new class of materials that are only one atom thick, and, on this basis, offers new inroads into low-dimensional physics that has never ceased to surprise and continues to provide a fertile ground for applications.},

	abstract = {Quantum electrodynamics (resulting from the merger of quantum mechanics and relativity theory) has provided a clear understanding of phenomena ranging from particle physics to cosmology and from astrophysics to quantum chemistry1,2,3. The ideas underlying quantum electrodynamics also influence the theory of condensed matter4,5, but quantum relativistic effects are usually minute in the known experimental systems that can be described accurately by the non-relativistic Schr{\"o}dinger equation. Here we report an experimental study of a condensed-matter system (graphene, a single atomic layer of carbon6,7) in which electron transport is essentially governed by Dirac's (relativistic) equation. The charge carriers in graphene mimic relativistic particles with zero rest mass and have an effective `speed of light' c* ≈ 106{\thinspace}m{\thinspace}s-1. Our study reveals a variety of unusual phenomena that are characteristic of two-dimensional Dirac fermions. In particular we have observed the following: first, graphene's conductivity never falls below a minimum value corresponding to the quantum unit of conductance, even when concentrations of charge carriers tend to zero; second, the integer quantum Hall effect in graphene is anomalous in that it occurs at half-integer filling factors; and third, the cyclotron mass mc of massless carriers in graphene is described by E = mcc*2. This two-dimensional system is not only interesting in itself but also allows access to the subtle and rich physics of quantum electrodynamics in a bench-top experiment.},

In a topological insulator, the spin--orbit interaction generates a non-trivial topology of the electronic band structure dictating that its bulk is perfectly insulating, whereas its surface is fully conducting. The first topological insulator candidate material put forward---graphene---is of limited practical use because its weak spin--orbit interactions produce a bandgap of {\textasciitilde} 0.01{\thinspace}K. Recent reexaminations of Bi2Se3 and Bi2Te3, however, have firmly categorized these materials as strong three-dimensional topological insulators. We have synthesized the first bulk material belonging to an entirely different, weak, topological class, built from stacks of two-dimensional topological insulators: Bi14Rh3I9. Its Bi--Rh sheets are graphene analogues, but with a honeycomb net composed of RhBi8 cubes rather than carbon atoms. The strong bismuth-related spin--orbit interaction renders each graphene-like layer a topological insulator with a 2,400{\thinspace}K bandgap.},

Here we report a third type of the integer quantum Hall effect. Charge carriers in bilayer graphene have a parabolic energy spectrum but are chiral and show Berry's phase 2$\pi$ affecting their quantum dynamics. The Landau quantization of these fermions results in plateaus in Hall conductivity at standard integer positions, but the last (zero-level) plateau is missing. The zero-level anomaly is accompanied by metallic conductivity in the limit of low concentrations and high magnetic fields, in stark contrast to the conventional, insulating behaviour in this regime. The revealed chiral fermions have no known analogues and present an intriguing case for quantum-mechanical studies.},

	abstract = {Electronic band structures dictate the mechanical, optical and electrical properties of crystalline solids. Their experimental determination is therefore crucial for technological applications. Although the spectral distribution in energy bands is routinely measured by various techniques1, it is more difficult to access the topological properties of band structures such as the quantized Berry phase, $\gamma$, which is a gauge-invariant geometrical phase accumulated by the wavefunction along an adiabatic cycle2. In graphene, the quantized Berry phase $\gamma$ = $\pi$ accumulated by massless relativistic electrons along cyclotron orbits is evidenced by the anomalous quantum Hall effect4,5. It is usually thought that measuring the Berry phase requires the application of external electromagnetic fields to force the charged particles along closed trajectories3. Contradicting this belief, here we demonstrate that the Berry phase of graphene can be measured in the absence of any external magnetic field. We observe edge dislocations in oscillations of the charge density $\rho$ (Friedel oscillations) that are formed at hydrogen atoms chemisorbed on graphene. Following Nye and Berry6 in describing these topological defects as phase singularities of complex fields, we show that the number of additional wavefronts in the dislocation is a real-space measure of the Berry phase of graphene. Because the electronic dispersion relation can also be determined from Friedel oscillations7, our study establishes the charge density as a powerful observable with which to determine both the dispersion relation and topological properties of wavefunctions. This could have profound consequences for the study of the band-structure topology of relativistic and gapped phases in solids.},

	abstract = {The honeycomb lattice structure of graphene requires an additional degree of freedom, termed as pseudo spin, to describe the orbital wave functions sitting in two different sublattices of the honeycomb lattice. In the low energy spectrum of graphene near the charge neutrality point, where the linear carrier dispersion mimics the quasi-relativistic dispersion relation, pseudo spin replaces the role of real spin in the usual Dirac Fermion spectrum. The exotic quantum transport behavior discovered in graphene, such as the unusual half-integer quantum Hall effect and Klein tunneling effect, are a direct consequence of the pseudo spin rotation. In this chapter we will discuss the non-trivial Berry phase arising from the pseudo spin rotation in monolayer graphene under a magnetic field and its experimental consequences.},

	abstract = {Owing to the unusual geometry of kagome lattices---lattices made of corner-sharing triangles---their electrons are useful for studying the physics of frustrated, correlated and topological quantum electronic states1--9. In the presence of strong spin--orbit coupling, the magnetic and electronic structures of kagome lattices are further entangled, which can lead to hitherto unknown spin--orbit phenomena. Here we use a combination of vector-magnetic-field capability and scanning tunnelling microscopy to elucidate the spin--orbit nature of the kagome ferromagnet Fe3Sn2 and explore the associated exotic correlated phenomena. We discover that a many-body electronic state from the kagome lattice couples strongly to the vector field with three-dimensional anisotropy, exhibiting a magnetization-driven giant nematic (two-fold-symmetric) energy shift. Probing the fermionic quasi-particle interference reveals consistent spontaneous nematicity---a clear indication of electron correlation---and vector magnetization is capable of altering this state, thus controlling the many-body electronic symmetry. These spin-driven giant electronic responses go well beyond Zeeman physics and point to the realization of an underlying correlated magnetic topological phase. The tunability of this kagome magnet reveals a strong interplay between an externally applied field, electronic excitations and nematicity, providing new ways of controlling spin--orbit properties and exploring emergent phenomena in topological or quantum materials10--12.},

Its main hallmark is the emergence of edge states localized at theboundary between regions characterized by distinct topological invariants. Becausetheir properties are inherited from the topology of the bulk, these edge statespresent a strong immunity to distortions of the underlying architecture. Thisfeature offers new opportunities for robust trapping of light in nano- andmicrometre-scale systems subject to fabrication imperfections and environmentallyinduced deformations. Here, we report lasing in such topological edge states of aone-dimensional lattice of polariton micropillars that implements an orbital versionof the Su--Schrieffer--Heeger Hamiltonian. We further demonstrate that lasing in thesestates persists under local deformations of the lattice. These results open the wayto the implementation of chiral lasers in systems with broken time-reversal symmetryand, when combined with polariton interactions, to the study of nonlinear phenomenain topological photonics.},

abstract={The recent realization of topological phases in insulators and superconductors has advanced the search for robust quantum technologies. The prospect to implement the underlying topological features controllably has given incentive to explore optical platforms for analogous realizations. Here we realize a topologically induced defect state in a chain of dielectric microwave resonators and show that the functionality of the system can be enhanced by supplementing topological protection with non-hermitian symmetries that do not have an electronic counterpart. We draw on a characteristic topological feature of the defect state, namely, that it breaks a sublattice symmetry. This isolates the state from losses that respect parity-time symmetry, which enhances its visibility relative to all other states both in the frequency and in the time domain. This mode selection mechanism naturally carries over to a wide range of topological and parity-time symmetric optical platforms, including couplers, rectifiers and lasers.},

abstract={The Su--Schrieffer--Heeger (SSH) model, which captures the most striking transport properties of the conductive organic polymer trans-polyacetylene, provides perhaps the most basic model system supporting topological excitations. The alternating bond pattern of polyacetylene chains is captured by the bipartite sublattice structure of the SSH model, emblematic of one-dimensional chiral symmetric topological insulators. This structure supports two distinct nontrivial topological phases, which, when interfaced with one another or with a topologically trivial phase, give rise to topologically protected, dispersionless boundary states. Here, using 87Rb atoms in a momentum-space lattice, we realize fully tunable condensed matter Hamiltonians, allowing us to probe the dynamics and equilibrium properties of the SSH model. We report on the experimental quantum simulation of this model and observation of the localized topological soliton state through quench dynamics, phase-sensitive injection, and adiabatic preparation.},

title = {A first theoretical realization of honeycomb topological magnon insulator},
journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {It has been recently shown that in the Heisenberg (anti)ferromagnet on the honeycomb lattice, the magnons (spin wave quasipacticles) realize a massless two-dimensional (2D) Dirac-like Hamiltonian. It was shown that the Dirac magnon Hamiltonian preserves time-reversal symmetry defined with the sublattice pseudo spins and the Dirac points are robust against magnon–magnon interactions. The Dirac points also occur at nonzero energy. In this paper, we propose a simple realization of nontrivial topology (magnon edge states) in this system. We show that the Dirac points are gapped when the inversion symmetry of the lattice is broken by introducing a next-nearest neighbour Dzyaloshinskii–Moriya (DM) interaction. Thus, the system realizes magnon edge states similar to the Haldane model for quantum anomalous Hall effect in electronic systems. However, in contrast to electronic spin current where dissipation can be very large due to Ohmic heating, noninteracting topological magnons can propagate for a long time without dissipation as magnons are uncharged particles. We observe the same magnon edge states for the XY model on the honeycomb lattice. Remarkably, in this case the model maps to interacting hardcore bosons on the honeycomb lattice. Quantum magnetic systems with nontrivial magnon edge states are called topological magnon insulators. They have been studied theoretically on the kagome lattice and recently observed experimentally on the kagome magnet Cu(1-3, bdc) with three magnon bulk bands. Our results for the honeycomb lattice suggests an experimental procedure to search for honeycomb topological magnon insulators within a class of 2D quantum magnets and ultracold atoms trapped in honeycomb optical lattices. In 3D lattices, Dirac and Weyl points were recently studied theoretically, however, the criteria that give rise to them were not well-understood. We argue that the low-energy Hamiltonian near the Weyl points should break time-reversal symmetry of the pseudo spins. Thus, recovering the same criteria in electronic systems.}
