  "abstract": "We study the problem when every matrix over a division ring is representable as either the product of traceless matrices or the product of semi-traceless matrices, and also give some applications of such decompositions. Specifically, we establish the curious facts that every matrix over a division ring is a product of at most twelve traceless matrices as well as a product of at most four semi-traceless matrices. We also examine finitary matrices and certain images of non-commutative polynomials by applying the obtained so far results showing that the elements of some finite-dimensional algebras over a special field as well as that these of the matrix algebra over any division ring possess some rather interesting and non-trivial decompositions into products of at most four generalized commutators.",
