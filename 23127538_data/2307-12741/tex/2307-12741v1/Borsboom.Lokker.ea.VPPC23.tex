% directly optimizing the geometric design of an electric motor via high-fidelity simulations


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{abstract}
In general, electric motor design procedures for automotive applications go through expensive trial-and-error processes or use simplified models that linearly stretch the efficiency map.
In this paper, we explore the possibility of efficiently optimizing the motor design directly, using high-fidelity simulation software and derivative-free optimization solvers.
In particular, we proportionally scale an already existing electric motor design in axial and radial direction, as well as the sizes of the magnets and slots separately, in commercial motor design software.
We encapsulate this motor model in a vehicle model together with the transmission, simulate a candidate design on a drive cycle, and find an optimum through a Bayesian optimization solver.
We showcase our framework on a small city car, and observe an energy consumption reduction of \unit[0.13]{\%} with respect to a completely proportional scaling method, with a motor that is equipped with relatively shorter but wider magnets and slots.
In the extended version of this paper, we include a comparison with the linear models, and add experiments on different drive cycles and vehicle types.
%In this paper, we present a framework to optimize the design of an electric motor and the gear ratio value for an electric vehicle powertrain.
%derivative free optimization and high-fidelity tools
%Specifically:
%In this digest also include magnet and slot characteristics
% full version: also compare linear stretching

We thank Dr.~I.~New for proofreading this paper. We also thank Ir.~J.~Goudswaard for his input and expertise on electric motor design.

%The preferred spelling of the word "acknowledgment" in America is without an "e" after the "g". Avoid the stilted expression, "One of us (R. B. G.) thanks . . ."  Instead, try "R. B. G. thanks". Put sponsor acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.


%References are important to the reader; therefore, each citation must be complete and correct. If at all possible, references should be commonly available publications.
