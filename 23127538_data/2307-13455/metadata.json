  "abstract": "Starting from a recently proposed framework for the evaluation of the cosmological averages, we evaluate the higher-order moments for the distribution of a given observable. Then, we explicitly discuss the case of the Hubble-Lemaître diagram and evaluate its skewness at the leading order in the cosmological perturbative expansion of the gravitational potential. In particular, we focus on perturbations of the luminosity distance due to gravitational lensing. Finally, we discuss our findings in view of recent numerical relativistic simulations, confirming that the skewness in the Hubble-Lemaître diagram primarily originates from the late-time matter bispectrum, with other line-of-sight projection effects being sub-dominant.",
