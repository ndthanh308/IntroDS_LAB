\textbf{\YLnote{
\checkednote{Feedbacks:  
1. The methodology is straightforward and seems incomplete.
The key question this paper hopes to answer is the optimized coding strategy under Poisson noise, but it uses a Gaussian noise assumption (though with reparameterization) to train the proposed model. The downstream tasks (classifying only 10 numbers) are oversimplified as well. All the future improvements as mentioned in the limitations are quite important factors to make this work complete.
2. The experiments are insufficient.
There is no comparison with any relevant method proposed in recent years. All coding strategies analyzed in Fig. 7 are classic ones.
3. The relevance to TPAMI is also poor. There is no citation to any relevant papers in earlier or recent issues from TPAMI. As a manuscript submitted to the regular track, the length is also a bit too short (only 9 pages excluding reference and bios).}}}
