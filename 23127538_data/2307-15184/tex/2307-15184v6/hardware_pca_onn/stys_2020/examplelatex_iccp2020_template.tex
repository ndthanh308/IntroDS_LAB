% The first section title should be wrapped inside a \IEEEraisesectionheading as follows.
\IEEEraisesectionheading{
  \section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
}
% The very first letter of the paper is a 2 line initial drop letter
% followed by the rest of the first word in caps.
% 
% form to use if the first word consists of a single letter:
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{demo} file is ....
% 
% form to use if you need the single drop letter followed by
% normal text (unknown if ever used by the IEEE):
% \IEEEPARstart{A}{}demo file is ....
% 
% Some journals put the first two words in caps:
% \IEEEPARstart{T}{his demo} file is ....
% 
% Here we have the typical use of a "T" for an initial drop letter
% and "HIS" in caps to complete the first word.
\IEEEPARstart{T}{his} demo file is intended to serve as a ``starter
file'' for ICCP 2020 submissions produced under
\LaTeX~\cite{kopka-latex} using IEEEtran.cls version 1.8b and later.

For submissions for review, the paper uses the lineno package which
might require you to compile under latex twice to get the line numbers
to align correctly.

%%%% For the camera ready version, please fill out this

% If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed) extra braces are
% needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
% the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated
% \includegraphics command within an optional argument. (You could
% create your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command
% to make things simpler here.)
% \begin{IEEEbiography}[{% Figure removed}]{Michael Shell}
% or if you just want to reserve a space for a photo:

\begin{IEEEbiography}{Michael Shell}
Biography text here.
\end{IEEEbiography}

% insert where needed to balance the two columns on the last page with
% biographies
%\newpage

% if you will not have a photo at all:
\begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{John Doe}
Biography text here.
\end{IEEEbiographynophoto}

% You can push biographies down or up by placing
% a \vfill before or after them. The appropriate
% use of \vfill depends on what kind of text is
% on the last page and whether or not the columns
% are being equalized.
