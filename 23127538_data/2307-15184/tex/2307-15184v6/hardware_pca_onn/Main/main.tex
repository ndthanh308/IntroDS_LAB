\noindent \textbf{\bnote{Notes for Paper Contributors:}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item To define new commands or include additional packages, add to \textit{include.tex}. If we have to change latex template this minimizes effort.
    \item To add new sections, add them under \textit{sections} and then edit \textit{main.tex}.
    \item For examples of how to add Figures, Tables, see \textit{examplelatex\_iccp2020\_template}.
    \item One method to create bibtex entries is by going to google scholar, searching paper title, clicking on the cite icon, clicking on Bibtex, and copying and pasting the google scholar bibtex to \textit{references.bib}
\end{itemize}

%%%% For the camera ready version, please fill out this
%%%% biography. Your camera ready should be within a 12 page limit
%%%% including acknowledgments, references and biography.

% If you have an EPS/PDF photo (graphicx package needed) extra braces are
% needed around the contents of the optional argument to biography to prevent
% the LaTeX parser from getting confused when it sees the complicated
% \includegraphics command within an optional argument. (You could
% create your own custom macro containing the \includegraphics command
% to make things simpler here.)
% \begin{IEEEbiography}[{% Figure removed}]{Michael Shell}
% or if you just want to reserve a space for a photo:

% \input{\homedir/sections/biography}

% insert where needed to balance the two columns on the last page with
% biographies
%\newpage

% if you will not have a photo at all:
%\begin{IEEEbiographynophoto}{John Doe}
%Biography text here.
%\end{IEEEbiographynophoto}

% You can push biographies down or up by placing
% a \vfill before or after them. The appropriate
% use of \vfill depends on what kind of text is
% on the last page and whether or not the columns
% are being equalized.
