% Abstract Single-pixel computer vision under poisson noise

 Optical coding has been widely adopted to improve the imaging techniques. Traditional coding strategies developed under additive Gaussian noise fail to perform optimally in the presence of Poisson noise. It has been observed in previous studies that coding performance varies significantly between these two noise models. In this work, we introduce a novel approach called selective sensing, which leverages training data to learn priors and optimizes the coding strategies for downstream classification tasks. By adapting to the specific characteristics of photon-counting sensors, the proposed method aims to improve coding performance under Poisson noise and enhance overall classification accuracy. Experimental and simulated results demonstrate the effectiveness of selective sensing in comparison to traditional coding strategies, highlighting its potential for practical applications in photon counting scenarios where Poisson noise are prevalent.
