% Abstract Single-pixel computer vision under poisson noise

 Optical coding is widely used in the design of computational imaging systems. While most coding approaches are developed with additive Gaussian noise models, most real optical imaging systems noise is dominated by Poisson noise due to light quantization. It has been observed in previous studies that code performance varies significantly between these two noise models. Therefore the design of an imaging approach, including the derivation of suitable codes, lenses, or cameras should take into account Poisson noise. In this work, we use the single pixel camera as a toy model to derive capture strategies that are feasible in Poisson noise limited environments. While our work has implications for all optical vision systems, we focus on a system designed for a highly compressive tasks like character recognition where the effect of Poisson noise is most apparent. We show that in such a case, our optimized capture approach can approach the performance of an ideal full resolution camera.
