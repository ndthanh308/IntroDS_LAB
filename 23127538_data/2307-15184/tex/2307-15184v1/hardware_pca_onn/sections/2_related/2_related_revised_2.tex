\textbf{Coding under Poisson noise}. In single-pixel imaging, coding allows the capture of a two-dimensional image with a single-pixel sensor \cite{harwit1979hadamard}. Hadamard matrices are considered the optimal coding scheme for multiplexing \cite{harwit1979hadamard, cossairt2012does, wuttig2005optimal} in systems with only additive gaussian noise. However, when Poisson noise is predominant, we should not use any coding \cite{harwit1979hadamard, cossairt2012does}. When the noise is Poisson distributed, coding with sparse priors such as compresses sensing are not recommended \cite{willet2009CSPoisson, willett2011poisson}.



% \textbf{Task Specific Imaging}

\textbf{End-to-end optimization} This method refers to training hardware and software networks for image processing pipelines \cite{diamond2021dirty, zhang2021deep}. \YLnote{In many previous projects, this idea was usually implemented without considering Poisson noise \cite{hinojosa2021learning, dun2020learned, metzler2020deep, chang2019deep, onzon2021neural, spall22hybrid_training} or without optimizing masks under Poisson noise during training \cite{tseng2021differentiable, diamond2021dirty, rego2022deep, duarte2008CS, nature2022ONN}. Rego et. al froze the sensing matrix as a pinhole without optimizing it \cite{rego2022deep}}
Wang et al. \cite{nature2022ONN} successfully implemented a neural network model for handwritten number classification on an optical device with limited photon budget, demonstrating the potential for AI-assisted optimization of coding schemes in CI. 
\YLnote{However, the Poisson noise was considered only in model testing where the most robust model was picked from a set of hyper-parameter combinations \cite{nature2022ONN}. } Our contribution is developing a noise-included training approach within a neural network model to find the optimal masks under Poisson noise.

better arrangement
coding under Poisson: mention hadamard book, ollie and becca's paper show that coding under Poiss is not ideal
mask optimization: people optimize the masks under wrong noise model, we proposed a better way for Poiss
