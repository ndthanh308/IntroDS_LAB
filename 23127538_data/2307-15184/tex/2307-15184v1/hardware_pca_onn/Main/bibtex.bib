    abstract = {Hadamard multiplexing is a measurement strategy that yields best sensitivity improvements over scanning measurements for signal-independent detector noise. The presence of photon noise degrades the performance of Hadamard multiplexing because of the increase of photon noise by the superposition of multiple signals. I derive the reduction of the sensitivity gain of a Hadamard measurement and an upper limit for the gain of any cyclic multiplexing strategy in the presence of photon noise. This upper limit clearly exceeds the reduced Hadamard gain and can be achieved by multiplexing sequences that differ from Hadamard S sequences but also share some similarities with respect to their autocorrelation. Examples of such sequences are given. As the analysis shows, the presence of photon noise limits the gain of multiplexing strategies to a finite value, which depends on the ratio between photon noise and detector noise and cannot be exceeded by increasing the number of multiplexed channels. In addition, only switching multiplex schemes, which superpose either all the light or no light of individual channels, can achieve the upper limit of the gain.},

Computations of the single-electron spectra have been carried out for a variety of stage-gains. Limited comparisons with available experimental data confirm that the effective statistical distribution of secondary emission in photomultipliers is broader than Poissonian and an interpretation in terms of non-uniformity of the dynodes is discussed.}

abstract = {Optical neural networks are emerging as a promising type of machine learning hardware capable of energy-efficient, parallel computation. Today's optical neural networks are mainly developed to perform optical inference after in silico training on digital simulators. However, various physical imperfections that cannot be accurately modeled may lead to the notorious ``reality gap'' between the digital simulator and the physical system. To address this challenge, we demonstrate hybrid training of optical neural networks where the weight matrix is trained with neuron activation functions computed optically via forward propagation through the network. We examine the efficacy of hybrid training with three different networks: an optical linear classifier, a hybrid opto-electronic network, and a complex-valued optical network. We perform a study comparative to in silico training, and our results show that hybrid training is robust against different kinds of static noise. Our platform-agnostic hybrid training scheme can be applied to a wide variety of optical neural networks, and this work paves the way towards advanced all-optical training in machine intelligence.},
