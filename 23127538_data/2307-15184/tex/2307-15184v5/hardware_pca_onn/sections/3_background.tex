\Xpolish{A single-pixel sensor, such as a photon multiplier tube (PMT), is capable of detecting the total number of photons in a measurement but lacks the ability to provide spatial information. In order to obtain this information, a Digital Micromirror Device (DMD) can be used to spatially code the signal. The DMD consists of millions of small tunable mirrors placed at the image plane of the camera objective lens. Each mirror reflects photons photons from a pixel in the image one of two separate detectors. During a measurement, the sensor counts the photons from the DMD

\paragraph{Impulse}
\paragraph{Non-Selective Codes}
Non-selective codes are codes that are not adjusted to the specific sparsity of the dataset. Any general code not generated using the statistics of a representative training set is included in this group. This incudes many codes used in practice today, such as Hadmard patterns and Rademacher Random codes. We also include truncated Hadamard patterns that are popular in compressed sensing. A truncated Hadamard code uses a random subset of the full Hadamard basis.
\paragraph{Selective Codes}
In this work we show that for single photon cameras, codes need to be specifically selected to measure sparse representations of the data. To achieve this we employ PCA codes and ONN generated codes. ...

Recall the model described by Equation \ref{eqn:NoiselessMeasurement}. \Xpolish{The sensing matrix $\B{M}$ can be generated by either computational or non-computational imaging methods. Their primary difference is that computational imaging requires additional steps of optical coding and computational decoding in order to capture and process the image \cite{cossairt2012does}. Non-computational method, or Raster scan, involves measuring each pixel sequentially \cite{duarte2008CS} and $\B{M} = \B{I}$ which is an identity matrix. On the other hand, computational methods measure a combination of pixels simultaneously and can be further classified based on the type of mask used.\Xhide{ In this paper, we will arrange the various coding strategies based on their mask generation techniques.

{\ynote{\checkednote{We distinguish different types of sensing matrixes: A diagonal measurement matrix corresponds to a raster scan where the image is measured pixel by pixel.

            \item Impulse Imaging (II). II captures the field of view by a pixel array. In this case, each pixel gets $N$ times as much as the exposure time of RS. Mathematically, $\B{M} = N\B{I}$. Alternatively, we can treat it as another RS with $N$ times as many photons. The II works as the baseline for the comparisons with other strategies. 
            \item Hadamard Basis (HB). In this strategy, we choose the 2-D Walsh-Hadamard matrix $\B{H}$ as the mask basis. Hadamard matrices composed of $\pm 1$ has been proved as the best coding strategy \bnote{WD is only mentioned once way earlier, probably better to just change this language.} for reconstruction by Hotelling in 1944 under the AGN.
