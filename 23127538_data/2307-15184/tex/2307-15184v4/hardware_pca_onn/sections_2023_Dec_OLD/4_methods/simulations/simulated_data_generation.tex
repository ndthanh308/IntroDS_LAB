\Xpolish{The MNIST dataset consists of handwritten digits from 0 to 9, with a default size of 28 by 28 pixels \cite{lecun1998MNIST}. In order to align the data with the Hadamard matrices, we padded the images with black pixels at the edges to resize them to 32 by 32 pixels \cite{lecun1998MNIST}. We then transformed the range of all pixel values from $[0,1]$ to $[0.3, 1]$. This operation enhanced the persuasiveness of the dataset for various noise models, as the added black pixels do not generate Poisson noise, whose variance is proportional to the expected photon counts. \bnote{did we ever vary the dark level (0.3)/ have results showing its effect?}}
{The MNIST dataset, which comprises handwritten digits ranging from 0 to 9, has a default size of 28 by 28 pixels \cite{lecun1998MNIST}. To align the data with Hadamard matrices, we added black pixels to the edges of the images and resized them to 32 by 32 pixels \cite{lecun1998MNIST}. Subsequently, we rescaled the pixel values from the original range of $[0,1]$ to $[0.3, 1]$. This rescaling was aimed at improving the dataset's suitability for different noise models, as the initial black backgrounds do not introduce Poisson noise, which is typically proportional to the expected photon counts.}
