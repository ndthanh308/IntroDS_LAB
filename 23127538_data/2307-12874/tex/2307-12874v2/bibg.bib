ABSTRACT = {In the ring-architecture-based federated learning framework, security and fairness are severely compromised when dishonest clients abort the training process after obtaining useful information. To solve the problem, we propose a Ring- architecture-based Fair Federated Learning framework called RingFFL, in which we design a penalty mechanism for FL. Before the training starts in each round, all clients that will participate in the training pay deposits in a set order and record the transactions on the blockchain to ensure that they are not tampered with. Subsequently, the clients perform the FL training process, and the correctness of the models transmitted by the clients is guaranteed by the HASH algorithm during the training process. When all clients perform honestly, each client can obtain the final model, and the number of digital currencies in each client&rsquo;s wallet is kept constant; otherwise, the deposits of clients who leave halfway will be compensated to the clients who perform honestly during the training process. In this way, through the penalty mechanism, all clients either obtain the final model or are compensated, thus ensuring the fairness of federated learning. The security analysis and experimental results show that RingFFL not only guarantees the accuracy and security of the federated learning model but also guarantees the fairness.},

abstract="A Bitcoin wallet is a set of private keys known to a user and which allow that user to spend any Bitcoin associated with those keys. In a hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallet, child private keys are generated pseudorandomly from a master private key, and the corresponding child public keys can be generated by anyone with knowledge of the master public key. These wallets have several interesting applications including Internet retail, trustless audit, and a treasurer allocating funds among departments. A specification of HD wallets has even been accepted as Bitcoin standard BIP32.",

	abstract     = {In cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum, users control funds via secret keys. To transfer funds from one user to another, the owner of the money signs a new transaction that transfers the funds to the new recipient. This makes secret keys a highly attractive target for attacks, and has lead to prominent examples where millions of dollars worth in cryptocurrency have been stolen. To protect against these attacks, a widely used approach are so-called hot/cold wallets. In a hot/cold wallet system, the hot wallet is permanently connected to the network, while the cold wallet stores the secret key and is kept without network connection. In this work, we propose the first comprehensive security model for hot/cold wallets and develop wallet schemes that are provable secure within these models. At the technical level our main contribution is to provide a new provably secure ECDSA-based hot/cold wallet scheme that can be integrated into legacy cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Our construction and security analysis uses a modular approach, where we show how to generically build secure hot/cold wallets from signature schemes that exhibit a rerandomizing property of the keys.},

The properties of DSA make it quite challenging to build a threshold version. In this paper, we present a threshold DSA scheme that is efficient and optimal. We also present a compelling application to use our scheme: securing Bitcoin wallets. Bitcoin thefts are on the rise, and threshold DSA is necessary to secure Bitcoin wallets. Our scheme is the first general threshold DSA scheme that does not require an honest majority and is useful for securing Bitcoin wallets.}

abstract="Over the past decade, cryptocurrency has been undergoing a rapid development. Digital wallet, as the tool to store and manage the cryptographic keys, is the primary entrance for the public to access cryptocurrency assets. Hierarchical Deterministic Wallet (HDW), proposed in Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 32 (BIP32), has attracted much attention and been widely used in the community, due to its virtues such as easy backup/recovery, convenient cold-address management, and supporting trust-less audits and applications in hierarchical organizations. While HDW allows the wallet owner to generate and manage his keys conveniently, Stealth Address (SA) allows a payer to generate fresh address (i.e., public key) for the receiver without any interaction, so that users can achieve ``one coin each address'' in a very convenient manner, which is widely regarded as a simple but effective way to protect user privacy. Consequently, SA has also attracted much attention and been widely used in the community. However, as so far, there is not a secure wallet algorithm that provides the virtues of both HDW and SA. Actually, even for standalone HDW, to the best of our knowledge, there is no strict definition of syntax and models that captures the functionality and security (i.e., safety of coins and privacy of users) requirements that practical scenarios in cryptocurrency impose on wallet. As a result, the existing wallet algorithms either have (potential) security flaws or lack crucial functionality features.",

Generally, two processes make up cryptography: encryption and decryption. Information is hidden via encryption, which is then unlocked by decryption. In the reference of above definition of modern cryptography, this chapter covers cryptanalysis, types of cryptanalyses---linear and differential and types of attacks. In addition to various cryptanalysis this chapter also covers cryptography in network security, cloud security, blockchain and bitcoin.",
