\label{sec:abstract}
With the advent of decentralized digital currencies through blockchain technology, a new era of peer-to-peer transactions is evolving. This rise in the global economy has witnessed an increased usage of cryptocurrency wallets, making them a focal point for security risks. This research aims to comprehensively explore the security aspects of cryptocurrency wallets. It provides a taxonomy of wallet types, analyzes their design and implementation, identifies common vulnerabilities and attacks, and discusses defense mechanisms and mitigation strategies. The taxonomy covers custodial, non-custodial, hot, and cold wallets, highlighting their unique characteristics and associated security considerations. The security analysis scrutinizes the theoretical and practical aspects of wallet design, while assessing the efficacy of existing security measures and protocols. Furthermore, the paper surveys defense mechanisms and transaction monitoring, evaluating their effectiveness in mitigating threats.
