\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

This paper systematically analyses the design, threats, attack vectors, and defensive strategies associated with cryptocurrency wallets. We introduce a comprehensive multi-dimensional taxonomy of wallet architectures, providing a structured and detailed framework to effectively understand and navigate the complex security landscape across various wallet types. By systematising diverse attack vectors, our framework offers clear insights into vulnerabilities and protective measures relevant to each wallet category.

Our analysis extends to examining 85 significant security incidents, accounting for financial losses exceeding \$6.98 billion. Through this systematic review, we propose targeted mitigation strategies corresponding to identified attack vectors and informed by our design taxonomy and security framework. Furthermore, our mapping of wallet mechanisms to specific design choices, threat profiles, attack methodologies, and existing defensive implementations underscores the critical interplay between different security dimensions and elucidates best practices.

We conduct a comparative analysis of incidents documented in industry contexts and vulnerabilities identified in academic research, revealing key gaps and convergence points between practical security threats and theoretical understandings. To further illustrate the practical applicability of our taxonomy and framework, we conduct detailed case studies, demonstrating its effectiveness in analysing and mitigating real-world wallet vulnerabilities and attacks.

By presenting an integrated perspective combining theoretical insights with empirical findings, our work lays the foundation for future research and practical advances, significantly enhancing the security and reliability of cryptocurrency wallets.
