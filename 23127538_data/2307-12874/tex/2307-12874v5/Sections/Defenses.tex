\label{sec:defense-strategies}

This section builds upon the framework outlined in \autoref{sec:attack-framework} by presenting mitigation approaches against wallet attacks. We aim to examine defence mechanisms for each identified attack vector affecting wallets.

\subsection{Network}
\label{sec:net-def}

Suspicious network activity can be detected through machine learning techniques, including anomaly detection models \cite{kapoor2021ransomware} and classification algorithms \cite{balakrishnan2023analysis}. Additionally, dynamic network parameter adjustments \cite{Girdler2021ImplementingAddresses} and other intrusion detection mechanisms \cite{guri2018beatcoin, zimba2019cryptojacking} further contribute to identifying such anomalies.

To mitigate these attacks, wallets can adopt network security protocols that validate and authenticate IP addresses \cite{rengarajan2016secure} and incorporate additional security layers within the wallet's network to prevent potential \teal{$txn$} modification attempts by adversaries \cite{Cai2014ResearchNetwork}. To limit or prevent \acf{ddos} attacks, wallets must distinguish malicious and authentic network traffic using classifiers such as the decision tree algorithm \cite{khan2019adaptive} and reinforcement learning approaches to analyse patterns in network data \cite{liu2018deep}. Another mitigation approach involves analysing the network for unusual patterns, such as repeated request attempts from the same \acs{ip} address \cite{sathwara2017distributed}.

\subsection{Application}
\label{sec:app-def}

To mitigate the risk of message alteration by clipboard hijackers, wallets can employ features such as NFC and two-dimensional codes to prevent recipient address modification during transaction creation \cite{li2020android}. From a user perspective, human-readable addresses such as \acs{ens} \cite{ENS2024EthereumService} aid in detecting address tampering, though they have certain security vulnerabilities \cite{Xia2022ChallengesENS}. Wallets can also prevent system behaviour modifications by addressing specific attack vectors. Attack vectors that attempt these modifications by targeting vulnerabilities in the \acs{os} can be mitigated by employing code obfuscation \cite{indusface} and runtime protection mechanisms \cite{qi2012spad}. Furthermore, by enforcing \acf{cfi} measures, wallets can ensure that control flow cannot be hijacked to deviate from intended control flow paths for malicious transactions \cite{Creech2017NewMitigation}. 

\subsection{Authentication}
\label{sec:auth-def}

Wallets can incorporate features either as direct protection against specific attack methods or as general authentication bypass protection. By directly integrating improved functionalities to obstruct access to predictive text data, wallets can prevent dictionary attacks \cite{Uddin2021Horus:Wallets}. Additionally, to prevent brute-force attacks, only complex passwords should be allowed in the initialisation stage  \cite{praitheeshan2019security}. Biometric falsifying attacks can be prevented by incorporating liveness detection features in wallets \cite{galbally2013image}.

To prevent single points of failure, wallets can enhance authentication levels (\autoref{sec:design-authen}) through \acs{mfa}, \acf{mpc} \cite{Lindell2020SecureComputation} and multi-signatory features such as \acs{bip}-11's M-of-N standard  \cite{bip11} (\autoref{sec:design-distr}). To mitigate social engineering attacks, wallets can incorporate phishing-resistant \acs{mfa} techniques such as FIDO2 \cite{Wang2021OnAttacks}. This feature enables communication with the original wallet website to verify authenticity before allowing access to the wallet \cite{fido2}.

\subsection{Storage and Memory}
\label{sec:sto-def}

An effective defence method against these attacks involves incorporating \acf{puf} to generate cryptographic keys on demand, without storing \teal{$sk$} on the wallet's chip. This method also prevents microscopy attacks, some other physical tampering attacks, and side-channel attacks (see \autoref{sec:crypt-def}) \cite{Urien2021InnovativeWallets, Park2024CloningFunction}. Physical tampering through the evil maid attack can be limited by implementing trusted boot mechanisms \cite{Tereshkin2010EvilEncryption}. Possible mitigations against non-invasive manipulation, such as the cold boot attack, involve adopting features which algorithmically clear the wallet's memory following intrusion \cite{seol2019amnesiac}. For example, Ledger has introduced a secure layer which detects chip intrusion and erases \teal{$sk$} following extraction attempts \cite{ledgerwallet}.

\subsection{Cryptanalysis}
\label{sec:crypt-def}

Exploiting cryptographic vulnerabilities can lead to \teal{$sk$} extraction. Attacks that aim to exploit weak cryptographic signatures (\teal{$\sigma$}) can be counteracted by employing stronger hashing algorithms \cite{Rokhjavan2023SecuringWallets}, while deterministic \teal{$nonce$} selection prevents nonce reuse attacks \cite{brengel2018identifying}. Non-invasive attacks on cryptographic functions, including timing and power \acs{sca}, are executed by exploiting side channels. Effective prevention methods include data leakage protection and disguising data access patterns as noise injection \cite{Akter2023AChallenges, Lou2021ACryptography, Ali2023CharacterizationHardware, Park2024CloningFunction}. These affect the adversary's ability to interpret leaked information effectively \cite{Mosquera2023GuardAttacks}.
