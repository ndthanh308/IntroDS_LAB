% \subsection{Ethical Considerations and Compliance with Open Science Policy}

% In this study, we proactively considered the ethical implications related to our research on cryptocurrency wallet security and the potential negative outcomes of our research. Our work adheres to all ethical standards and does not involve human participants directly.

% Furthermore, by systematising wallet vulnerabilities, threats, and defence mechanisms, we aim to enhance wallet security rather than inadvertently expose systems to new risks. To mitigate any potential harm, such as the misuse of identified vulnerabilities by malicious actors, we have ensured that sensitive data about specific attack vectors and implementation details of wallet designs are not disclosed in a manner that could enable exploitation. Additionally, our analysis focuses on existing wallet attack incidents, relying on publicly available data, to avoid violating user privacy or exposing sensitive information. In line with the open research policy at USENIX, all materials employed in this study will be made available to the larger public.


% \subsection{Figures}

% Below in \autoref{fig:hardware-mechanism}, we illustrate the difference between generalised software and hardware wallets based on our mechanism (see \autoref{fig:wallet-mechanism}).

% \subsection{Tables}

% Attached on the following pages are two tables on wallet attack incidents and institutional custody providers respectively.

% \paragraph{Table 5: Wallet Attack Incidents}
% \autoref{tab:attack-incidents} provides an overview of wallet attack incidents, between March 2012 and November 2023. As shown in the table, there is a lack of clarity on several attacks.

% \paragraph{Table 6: Institutional Custody Providers}

% \autoref{tab:instit2} shows institutional custody providers, who provide private keys management services for other organisations.

% \paragraph{Table 6: Business Data of Wallets}
% \autoref{CryptoWallets-Table-1} provides a business metrcis comparison of various non-custodial crypto wallets.


















% \subsection{Severity Calculation}
% \label{appendix:severity-calculation}
% We calculate the severity of each threat similar to Zhang et al. \cite{zhang2017conditional} in \autoref{tab:prob}. We define a function in \autoref{eq:probability-formula} to calculate the severity (S) of occurrence of a threat (T) using CVSS Exploitability and CC Attack Potential metric values.

% The table highlights the variety and severity of attacks, ranging from phishing and malware to private key compromises and insider jobs, affecting both custodial and non-custodial wallets.
