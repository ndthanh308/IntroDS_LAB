\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we explore multiplex relations to integrate interactive conversation, item knowledge, and social influence in helping learn the dynamic user preferences for conversational recommendation. We propose a novel hypergraph-based model, namely \underline{M}ulti-view \underline{H}ypergraph \underline{C}ontrastive \underline{P}olicy \underline{L}earning (MHCPL), which timely selects useful social information according to the interactive history and builds a dynamic hypergraph with three types of multiplex relations from different views. 
A hierarchical hypergraph neural network is proposed to learn user preferences by integrating information of the graph structure and sequential modeling from the dynamic multi-view hypergraph.
Furthermore, a cross-view contrastive learning module is proposed with two terms to maintain the inherent characteristics and the correlations of user preferences from different views. 
Extensive experiments on two popular benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, as compared to the state-of-the-art baselines.
