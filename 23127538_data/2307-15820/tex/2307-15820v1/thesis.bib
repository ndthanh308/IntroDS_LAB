              specifications.  They identify four classes:
              1. monolithic - a sequential process that names only observable
                 actions
              2. constraint-oriented - parallel composition of monolithic
                 specifications; no interaction between components
              3. state-oriented - a monolithic process with an
		 explicitly-defined (structured) state space
              4. resource-oriented - parallel composition of any kind
                 of specification; interaction allowed between components
              Classes 1 and 2 are called "extensional"; classes 3
		 and 4 are called "intensional".  The idea is that
                 intensional specs give design information.
              The factors that are involved in the classification:
                 - presence of concurrency (C)
                 - presence of interaction (C+)
                 - presence of structured state (S)
              The classes can be characterized by these factors as
		 follows: 
                 monolithic = {};
                 constraint-oriented = {C};
                 state-oriented = {S};
                 resource-oriented = {C+,S};
              The resource-oriented class is different: it acts like
              a function that adds C+ to the factors of the underlying
              specifications.

              Classifying scope of reduction techniques:
              correspondence - works for all;
              simulation     - works for all;
              BDD's          - works for only resource-oriented
              But note that all three are intended for
		 implementations, not specs.}}

    The paper shows how safety properties can be checked by capturing
    process behaviour by a set of linear inequalities.  The process
    model is that each process is a FSM; communication constraints
    are expressed in a recursive language.  Traces of the components
    that satisfy the communication constraints are legal traces.  The
    idea in the paper is that the components and constraints can be
    expressed as a set of linear inequalities.  Additionally,
    verification questions can be expressed as additional equations.
    If no solution to the resulting set of linear inequalities is
    found, then no trace satisfying the conditions exists.  On the
    other hand, if a solution may not indicate the existance of a
    legal trace.  In a sense, a solution represents a trace of a
    system with more behaviours than the actual system.

    There is a connection with process abstraction here, in the sense
    that the set of linear inequalities can be regarded as an
    abstracted form of the process with certain ordering constraints
    relaxed.  A question is whether the set of linear inequalities
    derived from a process corresponds exactly to some other process.
    If so, the technique might be expressible through process
    abstraction operators.

    The paper states that the set of linear inequalities do not
    exactly represent the processes they are derived from because a)
    the equations do not model the components exactly, and b)
    ordering of events in the constraints are ignored.  It appears
    that for case a) it may be possible to define an abstraction
    operation on processes such that A(P) has a trace iff the set of
    inequalities generated for P has a solution.  The idea is that
    A(P) takes any self loop of P and adds it to every state of P.
    (See example in Figure 1 of the paper).  It is not clear if case
    b) could be handled by abstraction operators. }}

    This paper basically says that the simulation relation is
    stronger than language inclusion, and easier to check, so can
    be used to verify language inclusion.  Processes are modelled
    as safety automata or Buchi automata.  In the latter case it
    is claimed that fairness is handled by requiring that accepting
    states map to accepting states in the simulation relation.

    Despite the grandiose title, this paper surveys various techniques
    to apply BDD-based checking of mu-calculus formulas to the
    solution of various verification problems.  Basically the paper
    has two parts:

    1. General framework
       - BDD's to represent processes
       - (Park's) mu-calculus to represent properties
       - a model-checking algorithm
       - iterative squaring - a technique to improve efficiency of
         mu-calculus formulas

    2. Applications
       - CTL - can be expressed in the mu-calculus
       - PTL - ditto
       - process equivalences - ditto
       - language containment in omega-automata - ditto
       - empirical results

    So the paper basically states: "we have a fast way to do model-
    checking in the mu-calculus, and all of these problems can be
    viewed as mu-calculus model-checking problems". }}

    Lamport describes in an expository fashion, with many examples,
    a linear temporal logic claimed to be suitable for program
    verification.  The logic is used to describe programs and
    specifications.  Implementation is modeled by implication;
    formula I implements formula S iff I => S.
    The logic has as atomic statements "actions",
    which are boolean expressions relating two states, where a
    state is just a valuation of variables.  Primed variables in
    an action A refer to the "new" state; unprimed variables refer
    to the old state.  The semantics of an action is:
        s [A] t = A(forall 'v':s[v]/v,t[v]/v')
    which reads "old state s is related to new state t by action A
    if A is true when unprimed variables of A are interpreted according
    to state s and primed variables of A are interpreted according to
    state t.
    The temporal part of the logic uses the single temporal operator
    box, denoted by [], having semantics defined in terms of
    infinite sequences of states:
        <s_0,s_1,...>[ []F ] = forall n.<s_n+1,s_n+2,...>[F]
    The interpretation of actions with respect to behaviours is:
        <s_0,s_1,...>[ A ] = s_0 [A] s_1

    Fairness is also treated.  A proof system is also given that
    axiomatizes validity of TLA formulas.}}
