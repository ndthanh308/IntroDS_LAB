%\section{Limitations}
% The segmentation quality of our method sometimes suffers on blurry frames with quick moving objects, and the similarity measure for the annotation candidate selection is not well-defined on such data either. The method usually performs well with multiple similar/identical objects in the frame, but can switch to the wrong target if they occlude each other. Visual illustrations are provided in the Appendix.
%\todo{APPENDIX: Speed and memory usage; IF have time - show that basically == XMem, realtime for 480p videos, extra memory usage is static, practical for long-term video segmentation.}
%\todo{Describe in 1-2 paragraphs the problem, "example frames are in the Appendix"}
