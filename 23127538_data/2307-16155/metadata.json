  "abstract": "This paper deals with astrophysical accretion onto the magnetically charged Euler-Heisenberg black holes with scalar hair. We examine the accretion process of a variety of perfect fluids, including polytropic and isothermal fluids of the ultra-stiff, ultra-relativistic, and sub-relativistic forms, when fluid is accreting in the vicinity of the black hole. By using the Hamiltonian dynamical approach, we can find the sonic or critical points numerically for the various types of fluids that are accreting onto the black hole. Furthermore, for several types of fluids, the solution is provided in closed form, expressing phase diagram curves. We compute the mass accretion rate of a magnetically charged Euler-Heisenberg black hole with scalar hair. We observe that the maximum accretion rate is attained for small values of the black hole parameters. We may be able to understand the physical mechanism of accretion onto black holes using the outcomes of this investigation.",
