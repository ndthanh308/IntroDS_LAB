  "abstract": "In this paper we examine the problem of valuing an exotic derivative known as the American passport option where the underlying is driven by a Lévy process. The passport option is a call option on a trading account. We derive the pricing equation, using the dynamic programming principle, and prove that the option value is a viscosity solution of variational inequality. We also establish the comparison principle, which yields uniqueness and the convexity of the viscosity solution.",
