\label{sec:lower_bound_diss}
% \zhihan{We can put this section into appendix if there is not enough space.}

Although it is not the main focus of this paper, in this section, we briefly discuss the known lower bound for multi-armed bandits from \citet{abbasi2018best} and explain why we believe one could seek a more refined lower bound, which can be another future direction. Here, we use $\theta\in[0, 1]^K$ to represent the parameter of a multi-armed bandit problem, in which $\theta_k$ is the mean reward of $k$-th arm. 
% Then, we raise an open problem of finding a truly instance-dependent lower bound, which we hope can enlighten future research. 

\paragraph{Multi-armed bandits lower bound} As mentioned before, \citet{abbasi2018best} proposes complexity measure $H_{\mathrm{BOB}}(\theta)=\frac{1}{\Delta_{(1)}}\max_{k\in[K]}\frac{k}{\Delta_{(k)}}$ and claims that this is the best complexity that any BAI algorithm can possibly achieve if it is constrained to be robust to non-stationarity.\footnote{Here, being robust to non-stationarity means, if using the terminology in \citet{abbasi2018best}, to achieve error probability in an order of $\exp\Sp{-T\Delta_{(1)}^2/K}$ under adversarial environments.} However, from a technical perspective, the previous statement is actually not precise. In particular, given some fixed $\theta^*\in[0, 1]^K$ and define $\mc{C}_4(\theta^*)=\Bp{\theta\in[0, 1]^K\mid H_{\mathrm{BOB}}(\theta^*)/4\leq H_{\mathrm{BOB}}(\theta)\leq 4H_{\mathrm{BOB}}(\theta^*)}$. Theorem 4 (the lower bound theorem) in \citet{abbasi2018best} states\footnote{This is the core message conveyed by its Theorem 4, which is although not exactly stated this way.} there exist absolute constants $c, c'>0$ such that for any algorithm, it holds that
% if $\sup_{\theta\in\mc{C}_4(\theta^*)}\P_{\theta}\Sp{J_T\neq (1)}\leq \exp\Sp{-\frac{cT}{H_{\mathrm{BOB}}(\theta^*)}}$, then there exists absolute constant $c'>0$ such that 
% $$\sup_{\allthetat \text{ with } \otheta_T\in\mc{C}_4(\theta^*)}\P_{\allthetat}\Sp{J_T\neq (1)}\geq c'.$$

\begin{equation}
    \label{equ:mab_lower_bound_state}
    \sup_{\theta\in\mc{C}_4(\theta^*)}\P_{\theta}\Sp{J_T\neq (1)}\leq \exp\Sp{-\frac{cT}{H_{\mathrm{BOB}}(\theta^*)}}\implies \sup_{\allthetat \text{ with } \otheta_T\in\mc{C}_4(\theta^*)}\P_{\allthetat}\Sp{J_T\neq (1)}\geq c'.
\end{equation}

That is, for some $\theta^*\in[0, 1]^K$, solely based on what this theorem conveys, a robust algorithm may achieve complexity strictly smaller than $H_{\mathrm{BOB}}(\theta^*)$, but it just cannot perform uniformly better than $H_{\mathrm{BOB}}(\theta)$ for any $\theta\in\mc{C}_4(\theta^*)$. 
% Thus, we can notice that this lower bound is not refined enough since for a single instance $\theta^*\in[0, 1]^K$, it fails to characterize what is the best error probability that any robust algorithm can possibly achieve.
Thus, we can notice for a single instance $\theta^*\in[0, 1]^K$ that this lower bound fails to characterize what is the best error probability that any robust algorithm can possibly achieve.


\paragraph{Open problem: a more refined lower bound} Therefore, it is natural to ask: can we characterize the best error probability of a single instance $\theta^*\in[0, 1]^K$? In words, this means to remove ``$\sup_{\theta\in\mc{C}_4(\theta^*)}$'' in equation \eqref{equ:mab_lower_bound_state}. Therefore, suppose $h:[0, 1]^K\mapsto\R$ is the complexity we hope to have and define similarly $\overline{\mc{C}}_4(\theta^*)=\Bp{\theta\in[0, 1]^K\mid h(\theta^*)/4\leq h(\theta)\leq 4h(\theta^*)}$. Then, an ideal theorem should state that for any fixed $\theta^*\in[0, 1]^K$ and any algorithm, if the algorithm satisfies $\P_{\theta^*}\Sp{J_T\neq (1)}\leq \widetilde{O}\Sp{\exp\Sp{-\frac{T}{h(\theta^*)}}}$, then we have absolute constant $c'>0$ such that
$$\sup_{\allthetat \text{ with } \otheta_T\in\overline{\mc{C}}_4(\theta^*)}\P_{\allthetat}\Sp{J_T\neq (1)}\geq c'.$$
Meanwhile, to be consistent with the lower bound in \citet{abbasi2018best}, for any $\theta^*\in[0, 1]^K$, there should exist some $\theta\in\mc{C}_4(\theta^*)$ such that $h(\theta)\approx H_{\mathrm{BOB}}(\theta^*)$, which explains why no robust algorithm can perform uniformly better than $H_{\mathrm{BOB}}(\theta)$ over $\mc{C}_4(\theta^*)$. Finally, we should be able to find some algorithm that nearly achieves complexity $h(\theta)$.
