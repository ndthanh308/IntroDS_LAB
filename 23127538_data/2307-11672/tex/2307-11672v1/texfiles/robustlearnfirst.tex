%\section{Robustness is learned first}
%In addition to top features in the eigenspace being both robust and useful, our analysis also justifies that robust features are learned first both in a random features model and also in NTK. 
%\begin{corollary}
%The prediction at time $t$ i.e. $f(x)_t$ can be written as the sum of NTK features with exponential decay depending on the eigenvalue of the feature $f(x)_t= \sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{(i)}(x)(1-e^{-\gamma t\lambda_i})$.

%Given  Thus at a fixed time during training, robust features converge first.
