  "abstract": "We investigate nanoscale domain engineering via epitaxial coupling in a set of SrRuO$_3$/PbTiO$_3$/SrRuO$_3$ heterostructures epitaxially grown on (110)$_o$-oriented DyScO$_3$ substrates. The SrRuO$_3$ layer thickness is kept at 55 unit cells, whereas the PbTiO$_3$ layer is grown to thicknesses of 23, 45 and 90 unit cells. Through a combination of atomic force microscopy, x-ray diffraction and high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy studies, we find that above a certain critical thickness of the ferroelectric layer, the large structural distortions associated with the ferroelastic domains propagate through the top SrRuO$_3$ layer, locally modifying the orientation of the orthorhombic SrRuO$_3$ and creating a modulated structure that extends beyond the ferroelectric layer boundaries.",
