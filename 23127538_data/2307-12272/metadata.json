  "abstract": "Beam dynamics calculations that are based on the Vlasov equation do not permit the the treatment of stochastic phenomena such as intra-beam scattering. If the nature of the stochastic process can be regarded as a Markov process, we are allowed to use the Fokker-Planck equation to describe the change of the phase space volume the beam occupies. From the Fokker-Planck equation we derive equations of motion for the beam envelopes and for the rms-emittances. Compared to previous approaches based on Liouville's theorem, these equations contain additional terms that describe the temperature balancing within the beam. Our formalism is applied to the effect of intra-beam scattering relevant for beams circulating in storage rings near thermodynamical equilibrium. In this case, the Fokker-Planck coefficients can be treated as adiabatic constants of motion. Due to the simplified analysis based on `beam moments', we obtain fairly simple equations that allow us to estimate the growth rate of the beam emittance.",
