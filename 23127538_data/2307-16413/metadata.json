  "abstract": "We analyse several aspects of detectors with uniform acceleration $a$ and uniform rotation $Ω$ in de Sitter ($Λ>0$) and anti-de Sitter ($Λ<0$) spacetimes, focusing particularly on the periodicity, in (Euclidean) proper time $τ_{\\rm traj}$, of geodesic interval $τ_{\\rm geod}$ between two events on the trajectory. For $Λ<0$, $τ_{\\rm geod}$ is periodic in ${\\rm i} τ_{\\rm traj}$ for specific values of $a$ and $Ω$. These results are used to obtain numerical plots for the response rate $\\dot{\\mathcal{F}}$ of Unruh-de Witt detectors, which display non-trivial combined effects of rotation and curvature through the dimensionless parameter $Λc^2/Ω^2$. In particular, periodicity does not imply thermality due to additional poles in the Wightman function away from the imaginary axis. We then present some results for stationary rotational motion in arbitrary curved spacetime, as a perturbative expansion in curvature.",
