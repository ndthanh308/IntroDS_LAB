  \caption{Examples of various semantic search scenarios supported in \olio{}. (A) \textit{Q\&A}. For an input query, \textit{``How has the trend of movie budgets changed over time for different genres?,''} \olio{} detects that it is a Q\&A search with an analytical intent, `trend.' A curated data source, `movies,' is the top-scored match to the query, and the system generates a multivariate line chart  response. A generated text summary describes the visualization as shown. Pre-authored visualization content is also displayed as thumbnails below the generated response as additional information. (B) \textit{Exploratory Search}. \olio{} identifies the input query, \textit{``elections,''} as a keyword search query and shows pre-authored visualizations with text content pertaining to `elections.' (C) \textit{Design Search}. The query, \textit{``treemap stocks''} is identified as a search of all content containing treemap visualizations pertaining to `stocks.' \olio{} returns a set of relevant pre-authored visualizations for the query and displays them as thumbnails. The thumbnails are linked to the actual visualizations if the user desires to continue with their analytical workflow.}
