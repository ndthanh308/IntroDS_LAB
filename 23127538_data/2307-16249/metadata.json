  "abstract": "The physics-based method of forecasting the high energy solar flares (SFs) with the help of the neutrino detectors utilizing the coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$ν$NS) is considered. The behavior of the neutrino beams traveling through the coupled sunspots (CSs) being the sources of the future SFs is investigated. Two neutrino beams are included into consideration, namely, the $ν_{eL}$ beam and the $ν_{μL}$ beam which have been produced after the passage of the Micheev-Smirnov-Wolfenstein resonance. It is assumed that the neutrinos possess the charge radius, the magnetic and anapole moments while the CS magnetic field is vortex, nonhomogeneous and has twisting. Estimations of the weakening of the neutrino beams after traversing the resonant layers are given. It is demonstrated, that this weakening could be registered by the detectors employing CE$ν$NS only when the neutrinos have the Dirac nature.",
