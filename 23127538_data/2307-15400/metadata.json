  "abstract": "This paper describes the FlySpeech speaker diarization system submitted to the second \\textbf{M}ultimodal \\textbf{I}nformation Based \\textbf{S}peech \\textbf{P}rocessing~(\\textbf{MISP}) Challenge held in ICASSP 2022. We develop an end-to-end audio-visual speaker diarization~(AVSD) system, which consists of a lip encoder, a speaker encoder, and an audio-visual decoder. Specifically, to mitigate the degradation of diarization performance caused by separate training, we jointly train the speaker encoder and the audio-visual decoder. In addition, we leverage the large-data pretrained speaker extractor to initialize the speaker encoder.",
