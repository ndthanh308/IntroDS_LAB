\begin{abstract}

Indian Judiciary is suffering from burden of millions of cases that are lying pending in its courts at all the levels. The High Court National Judicial Data Grid (HC-NJDG) indexes all the cases pending in the high courts and publishes the data publicly. In this paper, we analyze the data that we have collected from the HC-NJDG portal on 229 randomly chosen days between August 31, 2017 to March 22, 2020, including these dates. Thus, the data analyzed in the paper spans a period of more than two and a half years. We show that:
\begin{itemize}
\item the pending cases in most of the high courts is increasing linearly with time.
\item the case load on judges in various high courts is very unevenly distributed, making judges of some high courts hundred times more loaded than others.
\item for some high courts it may take even a hundred years to clear the pendency cases if proper measures are not taken.
\end{itemize}
We also suggest some policy changes that may help clear the pendency within a fixed time of either five or fifteen years. Finally, we find that the rate of institution of cases in high courts can be easily handled by the current sanctioned strength. However, extra judges are needed only to clear earlier backlogs.
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item pending cases in most of the high courts are increasing linearly with time (Fig. \ref{fig:hcpendency}, \ref{fig:np_hc1}, \ref{fig:np_hc2_p2}).
% \item in last few months, the data on HC-NJDG is far more reliable compared to earlier trends (\fref{fig:np_hc1}).
% \item there is a huge difference in terms of average load of cases on judges of different high courts (\fref{fig:pend_date_r}).
% \item if all the high courts operate at their approved strength of judges, then for most of the high courts pendency can be nullified within 20 years from now (Fig. \ref{fig:years_combat_real}, \ref{fig:years_combat_national_avg_lowest}).
% \item the pending cases filed by women and senior citizens are disproportionately low, they together constitute less than 10\% of the total pending cases (\fref{fig:womsen_hc_date} - \ref{fig:wom_hc})
% \item a better scheduling process for preparing causelists in courts can help reducing the number of pending cases in the High Courts (\fref{fig:fdl_hc}).
% \item some statistics are not well defined (\fref{fig:po_hc3}).
% \end{enumerate}
 
% We motivate the problem of pendency in detail and emphasize the need of designing efficient algorithms for scheduling cases in High Courts in India so that the number of pending cases in the High Courts reduce at a satisfactory rate.
