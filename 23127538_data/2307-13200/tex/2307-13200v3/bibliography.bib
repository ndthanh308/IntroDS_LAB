We cover topics such as equilibration and thermalisation in pure state statistical mechanics, the eigenstate thermalisation hypothesis, the equivalence of ensembles, non-equilibration dynamics following global and local quenches as well as ramps. We also address initial state independence, absence of thermalisation, and many-body localisation. We elucidate the role played by key concepts for these phenomena, such as Lieb–Robinson bounds, entanglement growth, typicality arguments, quantum maximum entropy principles and the generalised Gibbs ensembles, and quantum (non-)integrability. We put emphasis on rigorous approaches and present the most important results in a unified language.}

abstract = {We study the sampling complexity of a probability distribution associated with an ensemble of identical noninteracting bosons undergoing a quantum random walk on a one-dimensional lattice. With uniform nearest-neighbor hopping we show that one can efficiently sample the distribution for times logarithmic in the size of the system, while for longer times there is no known efficient sampling algorithm. With time-dependent hopping and optimal control, we design the time evolution to approximate an arbitrary Haar-random unitary map analogous to that designed for photons in a linear optical network. This approach highlights a route to generating quantum complexity by optimal control only of a single-body unitary matrix. We study this in the context of two potential experimental realizations: a spinor optical lattice of ultracold atoms and a quantum gas microscope.}

abstract = {A graph-theoretic approach to characterize discrete time crystals and use them as a complex quantum network simulator. Crystals arise as the result of the breaking of a spatial translation symmetry. Similarly, translation symmetries can also be broken in time so that discrete time crystals appear. Here, we introduce a method to describe, characterize, and explore the physical phenomena related to this phase of matter using tools from graph theory. The analysis of the graphs allows to visualizing time-crystalline order and to analyze features of the quantum system. For example, we explore in detail the melting process of a minimal model of a period-2 discrete time crystal and describe it in terms of the evolution of the associated graph structure. We show that during the melting process, the network evolution exhibits an emergent preferential attachment mechanism, directly associated with the existence of scale-free networks. Thus, our strategy allows us to propose a previously unexplored far-reaching application of time crystals as a quantum simulator of complex quantum networks.}}

abstract = {A crucial milestone in the field of quantum simulation and computation is to demonstrate that a quantum device can perform a computation task that is classically intractable. A key question is to identify setups that can achieve such goal within current technologies. In this work, we provide formal evidence that sampling bit-strings from a periodic evolution of a unitary drawn from the circular orthogonal ensemble (COE) cannot be efficiently simulated with classical computers. As the statistical properties of COE coincide with a large class of driven analog quantum systems thanks to the Floquet eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, our results indicate the possibility that those driven systems could constitute practical candidates for a sampling quantum advantage. To further support this, we give numerical examples of driven disordered Ising chains and 1D driven Bose–Hubbard model.}

abstract = {Interacting quantum particles can behave in peculiar ways. To understand that behavior, physicists have turned to quantum simulation, in which a tunable and clean system can be monitored as it evolves under the influence of interactions. Roushan et al. used a chain of nine superconducting qubits to create effective interactions between normally noninteracting photons and directly measured the energy levels of their system. The interplay of interactions and disorder gave rise to a transition to a localized state. With an increase in the number of qubits, the technique should be able to tackle problems that are inaccessible to classical computers. Science, this issue p. 1175 A many-body spectroscopy technique based on a chain of superconducting qubits gives insight into the localization transition. Quantized eigenenergies and their associated wave functions provide extensive information for predicting the physics of quantum many-body systems. Using a chain of nine superconducting qubits, we implement a technique for resolving the energy levels of interacting photons. We benchmark this method by capturing the main features of the intricate energy spectrum predicted for two-dimensional electrons in a magnetic field—the Hofstadter butterfly. We introduce disorder to study the statistics of the energy levels of the system as it undergoes the transition from a thermalized to a localized phase. Our work introduces a many-body spectroscopy technique to study quantum phases of matter.}}
