  "abstract": "A sound field synthesis method enhancing perceptual quality is proposed. Sound field synthesis using multiple loudspeakers enables spatial audio reproduction with a broad listening area; however, synthesis errors at high frequencies called spatial aliasing artifacts are unavoidable. To minimize these artifacts, we propose a method based on the combination of pressure and amplitude matching. On the basis of the human's auditory properties, synthesizing the amplitude distribution will be sufficient for horizontal sound localization. Furthermore, a flat amplitude response should be synthesized as much as possible to avoid coloration. Therefore, we apply amplitude matching, which is a method to synthesize the desired amplitude distribution with arbitrary phase distribution, for high frequencies and conventional pressure matching for low frequencies. Experimental results of numerical simulations and listening tests using a practical system indicated that the perceptual quality of the sound field synthesized by the proposed method was improved from that synthesized by pressure matching.",
