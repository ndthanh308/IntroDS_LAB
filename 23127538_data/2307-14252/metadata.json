  "abstract": "This work aims to study the radiative corrections in a vector model with spontaneous Lorentz symmetry violation, known in the literature as the bumblebee model. We consider such a model with self-interaction quadratic smooth potential responsible for spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. The spectrum of this model displays a transversal nonmassive mode, identified as Nambu-Goldstone, and a massive longitudinal mode. Besides the Lorentz symmetry, this model also exhibits gauge symmetry violation. To restore the gauge symmetry, we introduce the Stueckelberg field and calculate the two-point function by employing the principal-value (PV) prescription. The result is nontransversal, leading to a massive excited mode.",
