  "abstract": "We investigate the effect of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) of hydrogen atoms on the elasticity of ice VII at high pressure and ambient temperature conditions using ab initio path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) calculations. We find that the NQEs of hydrogen contributes to the transition of ice VII from a static disordered structure to a dynamically disordered structure at pressures exceeding 40 GPa. This transition is marked by a discontinuous increase of the elastic constants. Comparison of ab initio molecular dynamics and PIMD calculations reveal that NQEs increase the elastic constants of ice by about 20% at 70 GPa and 300 K.",
