\subsection{Computational Details}
All quantum mechanical calculations were performed using PySCF \cite{pyscf_article}. DFT calculations were executed at the B3LYP\cite{becke1993,lee1988} level of theory, with the Dunning's correlation consistent cc-pVDZ atomic orbital basis set \cite{Dunning_1989}.
Geometry relaxation, RICs selection, and coordinate transformations were performed using a locally modified version of PyBerny \cite{hermann2020pyberny}. 
Machine learning was performed using SciKitLearn \cite{scikit-learn}.
All through our work were used Python\cite{van1995python,ipython} 3.8 scripts, together with Numpy\cite {harris2020numpy}, Scipy\cite{2020SciPy-NMeth} and Matplotlib\cite{hunter2007matplotlib} libraries.
Molecules were plotted using RdKit \cite{rdkit,rdkit, landrum2013rdkit} and Py3DMol \cite {py3dmol}, a Python interface to the Java-based 3Dmol\cite{rego20153dmol}. Molecular IUPAC names were generated using Stout\cite{stout}.
