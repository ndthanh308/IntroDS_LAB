abstract = {Abstract A modified conjugate gradient algorithm for geometry optimization is outlined for use with ab initio MO methods. Since the computation time for analytical energy gradients is approximately the same as for the energy, the optimization algorithm evaluates and utilizes the gradients each time the energy is computed. The second derivative matrix, rather than its inverse, is updated employing the gradients. At each step, a one-dimensional minimization using a quartic polynomial is carried out, followed by an n-dimensional search using the second derivative matrix. By suitably controlling the number of negative eigenvalues of the second derivative matrix, the algorithm can also be used to locate transition structures. Representative timing data for optimizations of equilibrium geometries and transition structures are reported for ab initio SCF–MO calculations.},

abstract  = {Optimization methods that use gradients require initial estimates of the Hessian or second derivative matrix; the more accurate the estimate, the more rapid the convergence. For geometry optimization, an approximate Hessian or force constant matrix is constructed from a simple valence force field that takes into account the inherent connectivity and flexibility of the molecule. Empirical rules are used to estimate the diagonal force constants for a set of redundant internal coordinates consisting of all stretches, bends, torsions and out-of-plane deformations involving bonded atoms. The force constants are transformed from the redundant internal coordinates to Cartesian coordinates, and then from Cartesian coordinates to the non-redundant internal coordinates used in the specification of the geometry and optimization. This method is especially suitable for cyclic molecules. Problems associated with the choice of internal coordinates for geometry optimization are also discussed.},

    abstract = "{A procedure that automatically identifies internal rotation modes and rotating groups during the normal mode vibrational analysis is outlined, and an improved approximation to the corrections for the thermodynamic functions is proposed. The identification and the characterization of the internal rotation modes require no user intervention and make extensive use of the information imbedded in the redundant internal coordinates. Rigid-rotor internal rotation modes are obtained by fixing stretching, bending, and out-of-plane bending motions and solving the vibrational problem for the constrained system. Normal vibrational modes corresponding to internal rotations are identified by comparing them with the constrained modes. The atomic composition of the rotating groups is determined automatically and the kinetic energy matrix for internal rotation is given by either the constrained Wilson-G matrix or the Kilpatrick and Pitzer protocol. The potential periodicity, the rotating tops’ symmetry numbers, and the well-multiplicity are obtained using simple rules. These parameters can be altered by user input. An improved analytical approximation to the partition function for a one-dimensional hindered internal rotation has been developed that reproduces the accurate values tabulated by Pitzer and Gwinn to ±0.4\\% with a maximum error of 2.1\\%. This approximation is shown to behave better than previously available approximations over a wider range of regimes. The one-dimensional rotor treatment is generalized to give useful approximations to the multidimensional rotor thermodynamic functions that can be a good start for more thorough studies.}",
