abstract = {The secular equation for the vibration frequencies of large molecules is derived by considering such molecules to be assemblages of groups of atoms. This is useful because, particularly in hydrocarbons, intragroup vibrations within the groups are sometimes distinct from skeletal vibrations which are due mainly to translational and rotational motions of the groups regarded as more or less rigid units. The equations can be put in a form which reveals the terms tending to couple the intragroup vibrations of one group to those of others, and to couple the intragroup and skeletal modes. In this way it is possible to make simplifying approximations by intelligently selecting the small coupling terms. Even when coupling terms cannot be omitted some simplifications are possible because certain parts of the calculation are the same for any specific group regardless of its environment and can be used whenever the group is present in a molecule.}
