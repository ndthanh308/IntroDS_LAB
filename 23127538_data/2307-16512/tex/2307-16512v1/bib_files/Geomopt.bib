Results on a test set of 20 molecules show that, with an appropriate initial Hessian, optimization in Cartesians is just as efficient as optimization in internals, thus rendering it unnecessary to construct a Z-matrix in situations where Cartesians are readily available, for example from structural databases or graphical model builders.},

abstract = {When a molecular equilibrium geometry is determined by minimizing the energy by a quasi-Newton-Raphson method, the number of iterations required depends critically on the choice of an approximate molecular Hessian matrix. We find that a simple 15-parameter function of the nuclear positions gives a good choice for any molecule with atoms from the first three rows of the periodic table. This Hessian is used for ab initio geometry optimizations with the quasi-Newton-Raphson method, with or without update. The equilibrium geometries of 30 molecules, with a variety of sizes and symmetries, is obtained with the new scheme, which is shown to converge significantly faster than other methods.}

abstract = {A variant of quasi-Newton geometry optimization in Cartesian coordinates for atomistic calculations is proposed. Like other schemes, it starts from an approximate Hessian diagonal in redundant internal coordinates (bond lengthes, bond angles) which is improved by Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) updates. The key idea is to parameterize the diagonal elements of the starting Hessian on the fly. By automatically classifying all interatomic bonds according to bond length and elements involved, and treating all similar bonds equal, one arrives at a very small number of parameters that can be determined from few displacements, often only one. The superior performance for supercell calculations compared to a standard Cartesian-coordinate optimizer is demonstrated.}

It is formed as a first-order approximation to the coupled perturbed Hartree-Fock theory, and requires much less computer time than does the evaluation of the full Hessian. Its use in quasi-Newton methods that search for molecular geometry requires far fewer steps than other update procedures.}
