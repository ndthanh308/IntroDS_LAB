  "abstract": "In this work, we study the rotating wormhole geometries supported by a three-form field. We demonstrate for particular choices of parameters that it is possible for the matter fields threading the wormhole to satisfy the null and weak energy conditions throughout the spacetime, when the three-form field is present. In this case, the form field is interpreted as supporting the wormhole and all the exoticity is confined to it. Thus, the three-form curvature terms, which may be interpreted as a gravitational fluid, sustain these wormhole geometries. Additionally, we also address the ergoregion of the solutions.",
