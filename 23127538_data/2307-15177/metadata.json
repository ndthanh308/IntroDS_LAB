  "abstract": "Advanced tensor network numerical methods are used to explore the fidelity of repeated SWAP operations on a system comprising 20-100 quantum dot spin qubits in the presence of valley leakage and electrostatic crosstalk. The fidelity of SWAP gates is largely unaffected by Zeeman splitting and valley splitting, except when these parameters come into resonance. The fidelity remains independent of the overall valley phase for valley eigenstates, while for generic valley states, some minor corrections arise. We analyze the fidelity scaling for long qubit chains without valley effects, where crosstalk represents the only error source.",
