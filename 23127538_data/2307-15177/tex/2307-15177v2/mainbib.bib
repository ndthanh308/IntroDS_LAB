  abstract={Future quantum computers capable of solving relevant problems will require a large number of qubits that can be operated reliably1. However, the requirements of having a large qubit count and operating with high fidelity are typically conflicting. Spins in semiconductor quantum dots show long-term promise2,3 but demonstrations so far use between one and four qubits and typically optimize the fidelity of either single- or two-qubit operations, or initialization and readout4--11. Here, we increase the number of qubits and simultaneously achieve respectable fidelities for universal operation, state preparation and measurement. We design, fabricate and operate a six-qubit processor with a focus on careful Hamiltonian engineering, on a high level of abstraction to program the quantum circuits, and on efficient background calibration, all of which are essential to achieve high fidelities on this extended system. State preparation combines initialization by measurement and real-time feedback with quantum-non-demolition measurements. These advances will enable testing of increasingly meaningful quantum protocols and constitute a major stepping stone towards large-scale quantum computers.},

abstract = {Silicon spin qubits satisfy the necessary criteria for quantum information processing. However, a demonstration of high-fidelity state preparation and readout combined with high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates, all of which must be present for quantum error correction, has been lacking. We use a two-qubit Si/SiGe quantum processor to demonstrate state preparation and readout with fidelity greater than 97\\%, combined with both single- and two-qubit control fidelities exceeding 99\\%. The operation of the quantum processor is quantitatively characterized using gate set tomography and randomized benchmarking. Our results highlight the potential of silicon spin qubits to become a dominant technology in the development of intermediate-scale quantum processors. Operation of a two-qubit silicon quantum processor with high all-around performance metrics is achieved.}

journal = {Nature Communications},

year = {2022}, 
abstract = {Control of entanglement between qubits at distant quantum processors using a two-qubit gate is an essential function of a scalable, modular implementation of quantum computation. Among the many qubit platforms, spin qubits in silicon quantum dots are promising for large-scale integration along with their nanofabrication capability. However, linking distant silicon quantum processors is challenging as two-qubit gates in spin qubits typically utilize short-range exchange coupling, which is only effective between nearest-neighbor quantum dots. Here we demonstrate a two-qubit gate between spin qubits via coherent spin shuttling, a key technology for linking distant silicon quantum processors. Coherent shuttling of a spin qubit enables efficient switching of the exchange coupling with an on/off ratio exceeding 1000, while preserving the spin coherence by 99.6\% for the single shuttling between neighboring dots. With this shuttling-mode exchange control, we demonstrate a two-qubit controlled-phase gate with a fidelity of 93\%, assessed via randomized benchmarking. Combination of our technique and a phase coherent shuttling of a qubit across a large quantum dot array will provide feasible path toward a quantum link between distant silicon quantum processors, a key requirement for large-scale quantum computation.}

abstract = {Future large-scale quantum computers will rely on quantum error correction (QEC) to protect the fragile quantum information during computation1,2. Among the possible candidate platforms for realizing quantum computing devices, the compatibility with mature nanofabrication technologies of silicon-based spin qubits offers promise to overcome the challenges in scaling up device sizes from the prototypes of today to large-scale computers3--5. Recent advances in silicon-based qubits have enabled the implementations of high-quality one-qubit and two-qubit systems6--8. However, the demonstration of QEC, which requires three or more coupled qubits1, and involves a three-qubit gate9--11 or measurement-based feedback, remains an open challenge. Here we demonstrate a three-qubit phase-correcting code in silicon, in which an encoded three-qubit state is protected against any phase-flip error on one of the three qubits. The correction to this encoded state is performed by a three-qubit conditional rotation, which we implement by an efficient single-step resonantly driven iToffoli gate. As expected, the error correction mitigates the errors owing to one-qubit phase-flip, as well as the intrinsic dephasing mainly owing to quasi-static phase noise. These results show successful implementation of QEC and the potential of a silicon-based platform for large-scale quantum computing.}
