  "abstract": "Quantum tomography is a widely applicable method for reconstructing unknown quantum states and processes. However, its applications in quantum technologies usually also require estimating the difference between prepared and target quantum states with reliable confidence intervals. In this work we suggest a computationally efficient and reliable scheme for determining well-justified error bars for quantum tomography. We approximate the probability distribution of the Hilbert-Schmidt distance between the target state and the estimation, which is given by the linear inversion, by calculating its two moments. We also present a generalization of this approach for quantum process tomography and deriving confidence intervals for affine functions. We benchmark our approach for a number of quantum tomography protocols using both simulation and demonstration with the use of a cloud-accessible quantum processor. The obtained results pave the way for the use of the suggested scheme for the complete characterization of quantum systems of various natures.",
