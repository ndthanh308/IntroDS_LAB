	abstract = {Quantum computers can now run interesting programs, but each processor's capability---the set of programs that it can run successfully---is limited by hardware errors. These errors can be complicated, making it difficult to accurately predict a processor's capability. Benchmarks can be used to measure capability directly, but current benchmarks have limited flexibility and scale poorly to many-qubit processors. We show how to construct scalable, efficiently verifiable benchmarks based on any program by using a technique that we call circuit mirroring. With it, we construct two flexible, scalable volumetric benchmarks based on randomized and periodically ordered programs. We use these benchmarks to map out the capabilities of twelve publicly available processors, and to measure the impact of program structure on each one. We find that standard error metrics are poor predictors of whether a program will run successfully on today's hardware, and that current processors vary widely in their sensitivity to program structure.},

Further it is shown how the moment problem in the work of Hamburger came to be regarded as an important problem in its own right. From then on it moved away from its origin into other fields of mathematics---complex function theory and functional analysis---in the work of Nevanlinna and M. Riesz respectively. In the end it was made completely independent from continued fractions.

Es wird weiterhin gezeigt, wie sich dieses Problem in den Arbeiten von Hamburger als eigenst{\"a}ndiges Problem herauskristallisierte. Von da an l{\"o}ste es sich von seinem Ausgangspunkt and kn{\"u}pfte an andere Teilgebiete der Mathematik an, so an die komplexe Funktionentheorie und an die Funktionalanalysis in den Arbeiten von Nevanlinna bzw.

@article{Lin2017,
	abstract = {We consider univariate distributions with finite moments of all positive orders. The moment problem is to determine whether or not a given distribution is uniquely determined by the sequence of its moments. There is a huge literature on this classical topic. In this survey, we will focus only on the recent developments on the checkable moment-(in)determinacy criteria including Cram{\'e}r's condition, Carleman's condition, Hardy's condition, Krein's condition and the growth rate of moments, which help us solve the problem more easily. Both Hamburger and Stieltjes cases are investigated. The former is concerned with distributions on the whole real line, while the latter deals only with distributions on the right half-line. Some new results or new simple (direct) proofs of previous criteria are provided. Finally, we review the most recent moment problem for products of independent random variables with different distributions, which occur naturally in stochastic modelling of complex random phenomena.},

@article{Rahimi-Keshari2011,
	abstract = {We have developed an enhanced technique for characterizing quantum optical processes based on probing unknown quantum processes only with coherent states. Our method substantially improves the original proposal (Lobino et al 2008 Science 322 563), which uses a filtered Glauber--Sudarshan decomposition to determine the effect of the process on an arbitrary state. We introduce a new relation between the action of a general quantum process on coherent state inputs and its action on an arbitrary quantum state. This relation eliminates the need to invoke the Glauber--Sudarshan representation for states; hence, it dramatically simplifies the task of process identification and removes a potential source of error. The new relation also enables straightforward extensions of the method to multi-mode and non-trace-preserving processes. We illustrate our formalism with several examples, in which we derive analytic representations of several fundamental quantum optical processes in the Fock basis. In particular, we introduce photon-number cutoff as a reasonable physical resource limitation and address resource versus accuracy trade-off in practical applications. We show that the accuracy of process estimation scales inversely with the square root of photon-number cutoff.},

We present a technique for csQPT that is fully based on statistical inference, in particular, quantum expectation-maximization. The method relies on the Jamiolkowski isomorphism and iteratively reconstructs the process tensor in the Fock basis directly from the experimental data. This approach permits incorporation of a priori constraints into the reconstruction procedure, thereby guaranteeing that the resulting process tensor is physically consistent. Furthermore, our method is easier to implement and requires a narrower range of coherent states than its predecessors. We test its feasibility using simulations on several experimentally relevant processes.},

Trapped atomic ions are among the physical systems in which building such a computing device seems viable. In this work we present a small-scale quantum information processor based on a string of 40Ca+ ions confined in a macroscopic linear Paul trap. We review our set of operations which includes non-coherent operations allowing us to realize arbitrary Markovian processes. In order to build a larger quantum information processor it is mandatory to reduce the error rate of the available operations which is only possible if the physics of the noise processes is well understood. We identify the dominant noise sources in our system and discuss their effects on different algorithms. Finally we demonstrate how our entire set of operations can be used to facilitate the implementation of algorithms by examples of the quantum Fourier transform and the quantum order finding algorithm.},

By measuring the effect of the process on multi-mode coherent states via balanced homodyne tomography, we obtain the process tensor in the Fock basis. This rank- tensor, which predicts the effect of the process on an arbitrary density matrix, is iteratively reconstructed directly from the experimental data via the maximum-likelihood method. We demonstrate the capabilities of our method using the example of a beam splitter, reconstructing its process tensor within the subspace spanned by the first three Fock states. In spite of using purely classical probe states, we recover quantum properties of this optical element, in particular the Hong--Ou--Mandel effect.},

	abstract = {In the present work, we propose a generalization of the confidence polytopes approach for quantum state tomography (QST) to the case of quantum process tomography (QPT). Our approach allows obtaining a confidence region in the polytope form for a Choi matrix of an unknown quantum channel based on the measurement results of the corresponding QPT experiment. The method uses the improved version of the expression for confidence levels for the case of several positive operator-valued measures. We then demonstrate how confidence polytopes can be employed for calculating confidence intervals for affine functions of quantum states (Choi matrices), such as fidelities and observables mean values, which are used both in QST and QPT settings. As we propose, this problem can be efficiently solved using linear programming tools. We also study the performance and scalability of the developed approach on the basis of simulation and experimental data collected using IBM cloud quantum processor.},

@article{Flammia2012,
	abstract = {Intuitively, if a density operator has small rank, then it should be easier to estimate from experimental data, since in this case only a few eigenvectors need to be learned. We prove two complementary results that confirm this intuition. Firstly, we show that a low-rank density matrix can be estimated using fewer copies of the state, i.e. the sample complexity of tomography decreases with the rank. Secondly, we show that unknown low-rank states can be reconstructed from an incomplete set of measurements, using techniques from compressed sensing and matrix completion. These techniques use simple Pauli measurements, and their output can be certified without making any assumptions about the unknown state. In this paper, we present a new theoretical analysis of compressed tomography, based on the restricted isometry property for low-rank matrices. Using these tools, we obtain near-optimal error bounds for the realistic situation where the data contain noise due to finite statistics, and the density matrix is full-rank with decaying eigenvalues. We also obtain upper bounds on the sample complexity of compressed tomography, and almost-matching lower bounds on the sample complexity of any procedure using adaptive sequences of Pauli measurements. Using numerical simulations, we compare the performance of two compressed sensing estimators---the matrix Dantzig selector and the matrix Lasso---with standard maximum-likelihood estimation (MLE). We find that, given comparable experimental resources, the compressed sensing estimators consistently produce higher fidelity state reconstructions than MLE. In addition, the use of an incomplete set of measurements leads to faster classical processing with no loss of accuracy. Finally, we show how to certify the accuracy of a low-rank estimate using direct fidelity estimation, and describe a method for compressed quantum process tomography that works for processes with small Kraus rank and requires only Pauli eigenstate preparations and Pauli measurements.},

However, solving this task with current state-of-the-art techniques becomes unwieldy for large and complex quantum systems. Here we realize and experimentally demonstrate a method for complete characterization of a quantum harmonic oscillator based on an artificial neural network known as the restricted Boltzmann machine. We apply the method to optical homodyne tomography and show it to allow full estimation of quantum states based on a smaller amount of experimental data compared to state-of-the-art methods. We link this advantage to reduced overfitting. Although our experiment is in the optical domain, our method provides a way of exploring quantum resources in a broad class of large-scale physical systems, such as superconducting circuits, atomic and molecular ensembles, and optomechanical systems.},

We present an experimentally friendly method for density matrix reconstruction based on neural network generative models. The learning procedure comes with a built-in approximate certificate of the reconstruction and makes no assumptions about the purity of the state under scrutiny. It can efficiently handle a broad class of complex systems including prototypical states in quantum information, as well as ground states of local spin models common to condensed matter physics. The key insight is to reduce state tomography to an unsupervised learning problem of the statistics of an informationally complete quantum measurement. This constitutes a modern machine learning approach to the validation of complex quantum devices, which may in addition prove relevant as a neural-network ansatz over mixed states suitable for variational optimization.},

Here we show how machine learning techniques can be used to perform QST of highly entangled states with more than a hundred qubits, to a high degree of accuracy.

	abstract = {Quantum state tomography---deducing quantum states from measured data---is the gold standard for verification and benchmarking of quantum devices. It has been realized in systems with few components, but for larger systems it becomes unfeasible because the number of measurements and the amount of computation required to process them grows exponentially in the system size. Here, we present two tomography schemes that scale much more favourably than direct tomography with system size. One of them requires unitary operations on a constant number of subsystems, whereas the other requires only local measurements together with more elaborate post-processing. Both rely only on a linear number of experimental operations and post-processing that is polynomial in the system size. These schemes can be applied to a wide range of quantum states, in particular those that are well approximated by matrix product states. The accuracy of the reconstructed states can be rigorously certified without any a priori assumptions.},

@article{Boyd2015,
	abstract = {Quantum key distribution (QKD) systems often rely on polarization of light for encoding, thus limiting the amount of information that can be sent per photon and placing tight bounds on the error rates that such a system can tolerate. Here we describe a proof-of-principle experiment that indicates the feasibility of high-dimensional QKD based on the transverse structure of the light field allowing for the transfer of more than 1 bit per photon. Our implementation uses the orbital angular momentum (OAM) of photons and the corresponding mutually unbiased basis of angular position (ANG). Our experiment uses a digital micro-mirror device for the rapid generation of OAM and ANG modes at 4 kHz, and a mode sorter capable of sorting single photons based on their OAM and ANG content with a separation efficiency of 93%. Through the use of a seven-dimensional alphabet encoded in the OAM and ANG bases, we achieve a channel capacity of 2.05 bits per sifted photon. Our experiment demonstrates that, in addition to having an increased information capacity, multilevel QKD systems based on spatial-mode encoding can be more resilient against intercept-resend eavesdropping attacks.},

Qubit systems, or multipartite systems containing qubit subsystem, are exceptional in their relative simplicity. One faces a step in complexity in valuating measures of quantum correlations for qutrits and then other higher dimensional qudits. There is a growing number of arguments leading to such conclusion: recently found no-go theorem for generalization of the Peres-Horodecki's PPT criterion [1], change in geometry of state spaces of qubit and higher degree qudits (the so called 'generalized Bloch ball' is not a ball anymore), restricted possibilities for diagonalization of correlation matrices for bipartite systems, more difficult way for handling the set of relevant families of orthogonal projectors.},

@inproceedings{Gokhale2019,
	abstract = {Quantum computation is traditionally expressed in terms of quantum bits, or qubits. In this work, we instead consider three-level qutrits. Past work with qutrits has demonstrated only constant factor improvements, owing to the log2(3) binary-to-ternary compression factor. We present a novel technique using qutrits to achieve a logarithmic depth (runtime) decomposition of the Generalized Toffoli gate using no ancilla-a significant improvement over linear depth for the best qubit-only equivalent. Our circuit construction also features a 70x improvement in two-qudit gate count over the qubit-only equivalent decomposition. This results in circuit cost reductions for important algorithms like quantum neurons and Grover search. We develop an open-source circuit simulator for qutrits, along with realistic near-term noise models which account for the cost of operating qutrits. Simulation results for these noise models indicate over 90% mean reliability (fidelity) for our circuit construction, versus under 30% for the qubit-only baseline. These results suggest that qutrits offer a promising path towards scaling quantum computation.},

	abstract = {We propose a mechanism of Rydberg double antiblockade by virtue of a resonant dipole-dipole interaction between a pair of Rydberg atoms placed at short distances scaling as 1/R3. By combining this novel excitation regime with microwave-driven fields and dissipative dynamics, a stationary qutrit entangled state can be obtained with high quality, the corresponding steady-state fidelity and purity are insensitive to the variations of the dynamical parameters. Furthermore, we introduce time-dependent laser fields with periodically modulated amplitude to speed up the entanglement creation process. Numerical simulations reveal that the order of magnitude of the shortened convergence time is about 103 in units of \&\#x03C9;0, and the acceleration effect appears valid in broad parametric space. The present results enrich the physics of the Rydberg antiblockade regimes and may receive more attention for the experimental investigations in dissipative dynamics of neutral atoms.},

With focus on two-qubit quantum algorithms, we demonstrate a realization of the universal set of gates using a d=5 single qudit state. Manipulation with an ancillary level in the systems allows effective implementation of operators from U(4) group via operators from SU(5) group. Using a possible experimental realization of such systems through anharmonic superconducting many-level quantum circuits, we present a blueprint for a single qudit realization of the Deutsch algorithm, which generalizes previously studied realization based on the virtual spin representation (Kessel et al., 2002 [9]).},

Here an effective quantum circuit for the implementation of a controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate is constructed by introducing a non-computational quantum state in the auxiliary space. Furthermore, the method is extended to the construction of a general n-control-qubit Toffoli gate with (2n−1)\$(2n-1)\$ qubit--qudit gates and (2n−2)\$(2n-2)\$ single-qudit gates. Based on the presented quantum circuits, the polarization CNOT and Toffoli gates with linear optics are designed by operating on the spatial-mode degree of freedom of photons. The proposed optical schemes can be achieved with a higher success probability and no extra auxiliary photons are needed.},

	abstract = {At the heart of a quantum computer is the device on which information is to be encoded. This is typically done with a qubit, a two-level quantum system analogous to the two-level bit that encodes 0 and 1 in classical computers. However, there need not be just two quantum energy levels. There could be three (a qutrit), or more generally, d-levels (a qudit) in the device. Neeley et al. (p. 722; see the Perspective by Nori) demonstrate a five-level quantum device and show that their qudit can be used to emulate the processes involved in manipulating quantum spin. The use of multilevel qudits may also have potential in quantum information processing by simplifying certain computational tasks and simplifying the circuitry required to realize the quantum computer itself. A multilevel superconducting device is used to emulate the manipulation of quantum spin systems. In quantum information processing, qudits (d-level systems) are an extension of qubits that could speed up certain computing tasks. We demonstrate the operation of a superconducting phase qudit with a number of levels d up to d = 5 and show how to manipulate and measure the qudit state, including simultaneous control of multiple transitions. We used the qudit to emulate the dynamics of single spins with principal quantum number s = 1/2, 1, and 3/2, allowing a measurement of Berry's phase and the even parity of integer spins (and odd parity of half-integer spins) under 2π-rotation. This extension of the two-level qubit to a multilevel qudit holds promise for more-complex quantum computational architectures and for richer simulations of quantum mechanical systems.},

However, it also introduces complex dynamics to be understood and controlled. These dynamics can be simplified and made intuitive by employing group theory to visualize certain four-level dynamics in a `Bell frame'comprising an effective pair of uncoupled two-level qubits. We demonstrate control of a Josephson phase qudit with a single multi-tone excitation, achieving successive population inversions between the first and third levels and highlighting constraints imposed by the two-qubit representation. Furthermore, the finite anharmonicity of our system results in a rich dynamical evolution, where the two Bell-frame qubits undergo entangling--disentangling oscillations in time, explained by a Cartan gate decomposition representation. The Bell frame constitutes a promising tool for control of multi-level quantum systems, providing an intuitive clarity to complex dynamics.},

	abstract = {Presently{,} one of the most ambitious technological goals is the development of devices working under the laws of quantum mechanics. One prominent target is the quantum computer{,} which would allow the processing of information at quantum level for purposes not achievable with even the most powerful computer resources. The large-scale implementation of quantum information would be a game changer for current technology{,} because it would allow unprecedented parallelised computation and secure encryption based on the principles of quantum superposition and entanglement. Currently{,} there are several physical platforms racing to achieve the level of performance required for the quantum hardware to step into the realm of practical quantum information applications. Several materials have been proposed to fulfil this task{,} ranging from quantum dots{,} Bose--Einstein condensates{,} spin impurities{,} superconducting circuits{,} molecules{,} amongst others. Magnetic molecules are among the list of promising building blocks{,} due to (i) their intrinsic monodispersity{,} (ii) discrete energy levels (iii) the possibility of chemical quantum state engineering{,} and (iv) their multilevel characteristics that lead to Qudits{,} where the dimension of the Hilbert space is d > 2. Herein we review how a molecular nuclear spin qudit{,} (d = 4){,} known as TbPc2{,} gathers all the necessary requirements to perform as a molecular hardware platform with a first generation of molecular devices enabling even quantum algorithm operations.},

We explore the rotational, fine and hyperfine structure of 40Ca19F and 87Rb133Cs, which are examples of molecules with 2Σ and 1Σ electronic ground states, respectively. In each case we identify a subset of levels within a single rotational manifold suitable to implement a four-level qudit. Quantum gates can be implemented using two-photon microwave transitions via levels in a neighboring rotational manifold. We discuss limitations to the usefulness of molecular qudits, arising from off-resonant excitation and decoherence. As an example, we present a protocol for using a molecular qudit of dimension d = 4 to perform the Deutsch algorithm.},

	abstract = {Quantum computation promises to solve fundamental, yet otherwise intractable, problems across a range of active fields of research. Recently, universal quantum logic-gate sets---the elemental building blocks for a quantum computer---have been demonstrated in several physical architectures. A serious obstacle to a full-scale implementation is the large number of these gates required to build even small quantum circuits. Here, we present and demonstrate a general technique that harnesses multi-level information carriers to significantly reduce this number, enabling the construction of key quantum circuits with existing technology. We present implementations of two key quantum circuits: the three-qubit Toffoli gate and the general two-qubit controlled-unitary gate. Although our experiment is carried out in a photonic architecture, the technique is independent of the particular physical encoding of quantum information, and has the potential for wider application.},

	abstract = {Various quantum applications can be reduced to estimating expectation values, which are inevitably deviated by operational and environmental errors. Although errors can be tackled by quantum error correction, the overheads are far from being affordable for near-term technologies. To alleviate the detrimental effects of errors on the estimation of expectation values, quantum error mitigation techniques have been proposed, which require no additional qubit resources. Here we benchmark the performance of a quantum error mitigation technique based on probabilistic error cancellation in a trapped-ion system. Our results clearly show that effective gate fidelities exceed physical fidelities, i.e., we surpass the break-even point of eliminating gate errors, by programming quantum circuits. The error rates are effectively reduced from (1.10 $\pm$0.12) ×10−3 to (1.44 $\pm$5.28) ×10−5 and from (0.99 $\pm$0.06) ×10−2 to (0.96 $\pm$0.10) ×10−3 for single- and two-qubit gates, respectively. Our demonstration opens up the possibility of implementing high-fidelity computations on a near-term noisy quantum device.},

	abstract = {A major goal of developing high-precision control of many-body quantum systems is to realize their potential as quantum computers. A substantial obstacle to this is the extreme fragility of quantum systems to ``decoherence'' from environmental noise and other control limitations. Although quantum computation is possible if the noise affecting the quantum system satisfies certain conditions, existing methods for noise characterization are intractable for present multibody systems. We introduce a technique based on symmetrization that enables direct experimental measurement of some key properties of the decoherence affecting a quantum system. Our method reduces the number of experiments required from exponential to polynomial in the number of subsystems. The technique is demonstrated for the optimization of control over nuclear spins in the solid state.},

It has been realized in systems with few components, but for larger systems it becomes unfeasible because the number of measurements and the amount of computation required to process them grows exponentially in the system size. Here, we present two tomography schemes that scale much more favourably than direct tomography with system size. One of them requires unitary operations on a constant number of subsystems, whereas the other requires only local measurements together with more elaborate post-processing. Both rely only on a linear number of experimental operations and post-processing that is polynomial in the system size. These schemes can be applied to a wide range of quantum states, in particular those that are well approximated by matrix product states. The accuracy of the reconstructed states can be rigorously certified without any a priori assumptions.},

A major challenge towards practically useful quantum computing is characterizing and reducing the various errors that accumulate during an algorithm running on large-scale processors. Current characterization techniques are unable to adequately account for the exponentially large set of potential errors, including cross-talk and other correlated noise sources. Here we develop cycle benchmarking, a rigorous and practically scalable protocol for characterizing local and global errors across multi-qubit quantum processors. We experimentally demonstrate its practicality by quantifying such errors in non-entangling and entangling operations on an ion-trap quantum computer with up to 10 qubits, and total process fidelities for multi-qubit entangling gates ranging from {\$}{\$}99.6(1){$\backslash$}{\%}{\$}{\$} for 2 qubits to {\$}{\$}86(2){$\backslash$}{\%}{\$}{\$} for 10 qubits. Furthermore, cycle benchmarking data validates that the error rate per single-qubit gate and per two-qubit coupling does not increase with increasing system size.},

We present a technique for csQPT that is fully based on statistical inference, in particular, quantum expectation-maximization. The method relies on the Jamiolkowski isomorphism and iteratively reconstructs the process tensor in the Fock basis directly from the experimental data. This approach permits incorporation of a priori constraints into the reconstruction procedure, thereby guaranteeing that the resulting process tensor is physically consistent. Furthermore, our method is easier to implement and requires a narrower range of coherent states than its predecessors. We test its feasibility using simulations on several experimentally relevant processes.},

	abstract = {We have developed an enhanced technique for characterizing quantum optical processes based on probing unknown quantum processes only with coherent states. Our method substantially improves the original proposal (Lobino et al 2008 Science 322 563), which uses a filtered Glauber--Sudarshan decomposition to determine the effect of the process on an arbitrary state. We introduce a new relation between the action of a general quantum process on coherent state inputs and its action on an arbitrary quantum state. This relation eliminates the need to invoke the Glauber--Sudarshan representation for states; hence, it dramatically simplifies the task of process identification and removes a potential source of error. The new relation also enables straightforward extensions of the method to multi-mode and non-trace-preserving processes. We illustrate our formalism with several examples, in which we derive analytic representations of several fundamental quantum optical processes in the Fock basis. In particular, we introduce photon-number cutoff as a reasonable physical resource limitation and address resource versus accuracy trade-off in practical applications. We show that the accuracy of process estimation scales inversely with the square root of photon-number cutoff.},

We present a method for characterizing, with arbitrarily high accuracy, any quantum optical process. Our protocol recovers complete knowledge of the process by studying, via homodyne tomography, its effect on a set of coherent states, that is, classical fields produced by common laser sources. We demonstrate the capability of our protocol by evaluating and experimentally verifying the effect of a test process on squeezed vacuum.},

	abstract = {Optimization with constraints is a typical problem in quantum physics and quantum information science that becomes especially challenging for high-dimensional systems and complex architectures like tensor networks. Here we use ideas of Riemannian geometry to perform optimization on the manifolds of unitary and isometric matrices as well as the cone of positive-definite matrices. Combining this approach with the up-to-date computational methods of automatic differentiation, we demonstrate the efficacy of the Riemannian optimization in the study of the low-energy spectrum and eigenstates of multipartite Hamiltonians, variational search of a tensor network in the form of the multiscale entanglement-renormalization ansatz, preparation of arbitrary states (including highly entangled ones) in the circuit implementation of quantum computation, decomposition of quantum gates, and tomography of quantum states. Universality of the developed approach together with the provided open source software enable one to apply the Riemannian optimization to complex quantum architectures well beyond the listed problems, for instance, to the optimal control of noisy quantum systems.

	abstract = {Realizing quantum speedup for practically relevant, computationally hard problems is a central challenge in quantum information science. Using Rydberg atom arrays with up to 289 qubits in two spatial dimensions, we experimentally investigate quantum algorithms for solving the maximum independent set problem. We use a hardware-efficient encoding associated with Rydberg blockade, realize closed-loop optimization to test several variational algorithms, and subsequently apply them to systematically explore a class of graphs with programmable connectivity. We find that the problem hardness is controlled by the solution degeneracy and number of local minima, and we experimentally benchmark the quantum algorithm's performance against classical simulated annealing. On the hardest graphs, we observe a superlinear quantum speedup in finding exact solutions in the deep circuit regime and analyze its origins. Realizing quantum speedup for solving practical, computationally hard problems is the central challenge in quantum information science. Ebadi et al. used Rydberg atom arrays composed of up to 289 coupled qubits in two spatial dimensions to investigate quantum optimization algorithms for solving the maximum independent set, a paradigmatic nondeterministic polynomial time--hard combinatorial optimization problem (see the Perspective by Schleier-Smith). A hardware-efficient encoding protocol associated with Rydberg blockade was used to realize a closed-loop optimization method to test several variational algorithms and subsequently apply them to systematically explore a class of nonplanar graphs with programmable connectivity. The results demonstrate the potential of quantum machines as a tool for the discovery of new promising algorithm classes. ---ISO Rydberg atom arrays provide quantum speed-up for solving computationally hard optimization problems.},

	abstract = {The promise of quantum computing lies in harnessing programmable quantum devices for practical applications such as efficient simulation of quantum materials and condensed matter systems. One important task is the simulation of geometrically frustrated magnets in which topological phenomena can emerge from competition between quantum and thermal fluctuations. Here we report on experimental observations of equilibration in such simulations, measured on up to 1440 qubits with microsecond resolution. By initializing the system in a state with topological obstruction, we observe quantum annealing (QA) equilibration timescales in excess of one microsecond. Measurements indicate a dynamical advantage in the quantum simulation compared with spatially local update dynamics of path-integral Monte Carlo (PIMC). The advantage increases with both system size and inverse temperature, exceeding a million-fold speedup over an efficient CPU implementation. PIMC is a leading classical method for such simulations, and a scaling advantage of this type was recently shown to be impossible in certain restricted settings. This is therefore an important piece of experimental evidence that PIMC does not simulate QA dynamics even for sign-problem-free Hamiltonians, and that near-term quantum devices can be used to accelerate computational tasks of practical relevance.},

	abstract = { The development of a practical quantum computer requires universality, scalability, and fault tolerance. Although much progress is being made in circuit platforms in which arrays of qubits are addressed and manipulated individually, scale-up of such systems is experimentally challenging. Asavanant et al. and Larsen et al. explore an alternative route: measurement-based quantum computation, which is a platform based on the generation of large-scale cluster states. As these are optically prepared and easier to handle (one simply performs local measurements on each individual component of the cluster state), such a platform is readily scalable and fault tolerant. The topology of the cluster state ensures that the approach meets the requirements for quantum computation. Science, this issue p. 373, p. 369 Two-dimensional cluster states are generated, a necessary requirement for universal quantum computing. Measurement-based quantum computation offers exponential computational speed-up through simple measurements on a large entangled cluster state. We propose and demonstrate a scalable scheme for the generation of photonic cluster states suitable for universal measurement-based quantum computation. We exploit temporal multiplexing of squeezed light modes, delay loops, and beam-splitter transformations to deterministically generate a cylindrical cluster state with a two-dimensional (2D) topological structure as required for universal quantum information processing. The generated state consists of more than 30,000 entangled modes arranged in a cylindrical lattice with 24 modes on the circumference, defining the input register, and a length of 1250 modes, defining the computation depth. Our demonstrated source of two-dimensional cluster states can be combined with quantum error correction to enable fault-tolerant quantum computation. },

	abstract = {Quantum computing can be realized with numerous different hardware platforms and computational protocols. A highly promising, and potentially scalable, idea is to combine a photonic platform with measurement-induced quantum information processing. In this approach, gate operations can be implemented through optical measurements on a multipartite entangled quantum state---a so-called cluster state. Previously, a few quantum gates on non-universal or non-scalable cluster states have been performed, but a full set of gates for universal scalable quantum computing has not been realized. Here we propose and demonstrate the deterministic implementation of a multi-mode set of measurement-induced quantum gates in a large two-dimensional optical cluster state using phase-controlled continuous-variable quadrature measurements. Each gate is programmed into the phases of high-efficiency quadrature measurements, which execute the transformations by teleportation through the cluster state. We further execute a small quantum circuit consisting of 10 single-mode gates and 2 two-mode gates on a three-mode input state. Fault-tolerant universal quantum computing is possible with this platform if the cluster-state entanglement is improved and a supply of states with Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill encoding is available.},

The failure of annealing dynamics to equilibrate on practical time scales is a well understood limitation, but does not always prevent a heuristically useful distribution from being generated. In this paper, we evaluate several methods for determining a useful operational temperature range for annealers. We show that, even where distributions deviate from the Boltzmann distribution due to ergodicity breaking, these estimates can be useful. We introduce the concepts of local and global temperatures that are captured by different estimation methods. We argue that for practical application it often makes sense to analyze annealers that are subject to post-processing in order to isolate the macroscopic distribution deviations that are a practical barrier to their application.},

Suppose we have a gamma-weak learner for a Boolean concept class C that takes time R(C), then the time complexity of AdaBoost scales as VC(C)poly(R(C), 1/gamma), where VC(C) is the VC-dimension of C. In this paper, we show how quantum techniques can improve the time complexity of classical AdaBoost. To this end, suppose we have a gamma-weak quantum learning algorithm for a Boolean concept class C that takes time Q(C), we introduce a quantum boosting algorithm whose complexity scales as sqrt{VC(C)}poly(Q(C),1/gamma); thereby achieving quadratic quantum improvement over classical AdaBoost in terms of &nbsp;VC(C).},

Description of protein-like properties are more accurately described by generalized models, such as the one proposed by Miyazawa and Jernigan (MJ), which explicitly take into account the unique interactions among all 20 amino acids. There is theoretical and experimental evidence of the advantage of solving classical optimization problems using quantum annealing over its classical analogue (simulated annealing).

To address this discrepancy, a quantum-classical hybrid optimization scheme known as `the quantum variational eigensolver' was developed (Peruzzo et al 2014 Nat. Commun. 5 4213) with the philosophy that even minimal quantum resources could be made useful when used in conjunction with classical routines. In this work we extend the general theory of this algorithm and suggest algorithmic improvements for practical implementations. Specifically, we develop a variational adiabatic ansatz and explore unitary coupled cluster where we establish a connection from second order unitary coupled cluster to universal gate sets through a relaxation of exponential operator splitting. We introduce the concept of quantum variational error suppression that allows some errors to be suppressed naturally in this algorithm on a pre-threshold quantum device. Additionally, we analyze truncation and correlated sampling in Hamiltonian averaging as ways to reduce the cost of this procedure. Finally, we show how the use of modern derivative free optimization techniques can offer dramatic computational savings of up to three orders of magnitude over previously used optimization techniques.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing has rapidly advanced in recent years due to substantial development in both hardware and algorithms. These advances are carrying quantum computers closer to their impending commercial utility. Drug discovery is a promising area of application that will find a number of uses for these new machines. As a prominent example, quantum simulation will enable faster and more accurate characterizations of molecular systems than existing quantum chemistry methods. Furthermore, algorithmic developments in quantum machine learning offer interesting alternatives to classical machine learning techniques, which may also be useful for the biochemical efforts involved in early phases of drug discovery. Meanwhile, quantum hardware is scaling up rapidly into a regime where an exact simulation is difficult even using the world's largest supercomputers. We review how these recent advances can shift the paradigm with which one thinks about drug discovery, focusing on both the promises and caveats associated with each development. In particular, we highlight how hybrid quantum-classical approaches to quantum simulation and quantum machine learning could yield substantial progress using noisy-intermediate scale quantum devices, whereas fault-tolerant, error-corrected quantum computers are still in their development phase.},

	abstract = {Integer factorization has been one of the cornerstone applications of the field of quantum computing since the discovery of an efficient algorithm for factoring by Peter Shor. Unfortunately, factoring via Shor's algorithm is well beyond the capabilities of today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we revisit the problem of factoring, developing an alternative to Shor's algorithm, which employs established techniques to map the factoring problem to the ground state of an Ising Hamiltonian. The proposed variational quantum factoring (VQF) algorithm starts by simplifying equations over Boolean variables in a preprocessing step to reduce the number of qubits needed for the Hamiltonian. Then, it seeks an approximate ground state of the resulting Ising Hamiltonian by training variational circuits using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). We benchmark the VQF algorithm on various instances of factoring and present numerical results on its performance.},

	abstract = {Many experimental proposals for noisy intermediate scale quantum devices involve training a parameterized quantum circuit with a classical optimization loop. Such hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are popular for applications in quantum simulation, optimization, and machine learning. Due to its simplicity and hardware efficiency, random circuits are often proposed as initial guesses for exploring the space of quantum states. We show that the exponential dimension of Hilbert space and the gradient estimation complexity make this choice unsuitable for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms run on more than a few qubits. Specifically, we show that for a wide class of reasonable parameterized quantum circuits, the probability that the gradient along any reasonable direction is non-zero to some fixed precision is exponentially small as a function of the number of qubits. We argue that this is related to the 2-design characteristic of random circuits, and that solutions to this problem must be studied.},

	abstract = { Accurate electronic structure calculations are considered one of the most anticipated applications of quantum computing that will revolutionize theoretical chemistry and other related fields. Using the Google Sycamore quantum processor, Google AI Quantum and collaborators performed a variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) simulation of two intermediate-scale chemistry problems: the binding energy of hydrogen chains (as large as H12) and the isomerization mechanism of diazene (see the Perspective by Yuan). The simulations were performed on up to 12 qubits, involving up to 72 two-qubit gates, and show that it is possible to achieve chemical accuracy when VQE is combined with error mitigation strategies. The key building blocks of the proposed VQE algorithm are potentially scalable to larger systems that cannot be simulated classically. Science, this issue p. 1084; see also p. 1054 Accurate quantum simulations of chemistry are performed using up to 12 superconducting qubits and 72 two-qubit gates. The simulation of fermionic systems is among the most anticipated applications of quantum computing. We performed several quantum simulations of chemistry with up to one dozen qubits, including modeling the isomerization mechanism of diazene. We also demonstrated error-mitigation strategies based on N-representability that dramatically improve the effective fidelity of our experiments. Our parameterized ansatz circuits realized the Givens rotation approach to noninteracting fermion evolution, which we variationally optimized to prepare the Hartree-Fock wave function. This ubiquitous algorithmic primitive is classically tractable to simulate yet still generates highly entangled states over the computational basis, which allowed us to assess the performance of our hardware and establish a foundation for scaling up correlated quantum chemistry simulations. },

	abstract = {Faster algorithms for combinatorial optimization could prove transformative for diverse areas such as logistics, finance and machine learning. Accordingly, the possibility of quantum enhanced optimization has driven much interest in quantum technologies. Here we demonstrate the application of the Google Sycamore superconducting qubit quantum processor to combinatorial optimization problems with the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). Like past QAOA experiments, we study performance for problems defined on the planar connectivity graph native to our hardware; however, we also apply the QAOA to the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model and MaxCut, non-native problems that require extensive compilation to implement. For hardware-native problems, which are classically efficient to solve on average, we obtain an approximation ratio that is independent of problem size and observe that performance increases with circuit depth. For problems requiring compilation, performance decreases with problem size. Circuits involving several thousand gates still present an advantage over random guessing but not over some efficient classical algorithms. Our results suggest that it will be challenging to scale near-term implementations of the QAOA for problems on non-native graphs. As these graphs are closer to real-world instances, we suggest more emphasis should be placed on such problems when using the QAOA to benchmark quantum processors.},

Quantum computers promise a solution, although fault-tolerant quantum computers will probably not be available in the near future. Current quantum devices have serious constraints, including limited numbers of qubits and noise processes that limit circuit depth. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which use a classical optimizer to train a parameterized quantum circuit, have emerged as a leading strategy to address these constraints. VQAs have now been proposed for essentially all applications that researchers have envisaged for quantum computers, and they appear to be the best hope for obtaining quantum advantage. Nevertheless, challenges remain, including the trainability, accuracy and efficiency of VQAs. Here we overview the field of VQAs, discuss strategies to overcome their challenges and highlight the exciting prospects for using them to obtain quantum advantage.},

	abstract = {Lattice gauge theories, which originated from particle physics in the context of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), provide an important intellectual stimulus to further develop quantum information technologies. While one long-term goal is the reliable quantum simulation of currently intractable aspects of QCD itself, lattice gauge theories also play an important role in condensed matter physics and in quantum information science. In this way, lattice gauge theories provide both motivation and a framework for interdisciplinary research towards the development of special purpose digital and analog quantum simulators, and ultimately of scalable universal quantum computers. In this manuscript, recent results and new tools from a quantum science approach to study lattice gauge theories are reviewed. Two new complementary approaches are discussed: first, tensor network methods are presented --a classical simulation approach --applied to the study of lattice gauge theories together with some results on Abelian and non-Abelian lattice gauge theories. Then, recent proposals for the implementation of lattice gauge theory quantum simulators in different quantum hardware are reported, e.g., trapped ions, Rydberg atoms, and superconducting circuits. Finally, the first proof-of-principle trapped ions experimental quantum simulations of the Schwinger model are reviewed.},

We propose that these systems can, in fact, be used as a robust quantum simulation platform that enables the study of strongly correlated physics and topology in quantum materials. Among the features that make these materials a versatile toolbox are the tunability of their properties through readily accessible external parameters such as gating, straining, packing and twist angle; the feasibility to realize and control a large number of fundamental many-body quantum models relevant in the field of condensed-matter physics; and finally, the availability of experimental readout protocols that directly map their rich phase diagrams in and out of equilibrium. This general framework makes it possible to robustly realize and functionalize new phases of matter in a modular fashion, thus broadening the landscape of accessible physics and holding promise for future technological applications.},

	abstract = {Machine learning has been presented as one of the key applications for near-term quantum technologies, given its high commercial value and wide range of applicability. In this work, we introduce the quantum-assisted Helmholtz machine:a hybrid quantum--classical framework with the potential of tackling high-dimensional real-world machine learning datasets on continuous variables. Instead of using quantum computers only to assist deep learning, as previous approaches have suggested, we use deep learning to extract a low-dimensional binary representation of data, suitable for processing on relatively small quantum computers. Then, the quantum hardware and deep learning architecture work together to train an unsupervised generative model. We demonstrate this concept using 1644 quantum bits of a D-Wave 2000Q quantum device to model a sub-sampled version of the MNIST handwritten digit dataset with 16 × 16 continuous valued pixels. Although we illustrate this concept on a quantum annealer, adaptations to other quantum platforms, such as ion-trap technologies or superconducting gate-model architectures, could be explored within this flexible framework.},

	abstract = {Abstract Quantum computers can in principle solve certain problems exponentially more quickly than their classical counterparts. We have not yet reached the advent of useful quantum computation, but when we do, it will affect nearly all scientific disciplines. In this review, we examine how current quantum algorithms could revolutionize computational biology and bioinformatics. There are potential benefits across the entire field, from the ability to process vast amounts of information and run machine learning algorithms far more efficiently, to algorithms for quantum simulation that are poised to improve computational calculations in drug discovery, to quantum algorithms for optimization that may advance fields from protein structure prediction to network analysis. However, these exciting prospects are susceptible to ``hype,'' and it is also important to recognize the caveats and challenges in this new technology. Our aim is to introduce the promise and limitations of emerging quantum computing technologies in the areas of computational molecular biology and bioinformatics.

@article{Bennett1982,
	abstract = {Computers may be thought of as engines for transforming free energy into waste heat and mathematical work. Existing electronic computers dissipate energy vastly in excess of the mean thermal energykT, for purposes such as maintaining volatile storage devices in a bistable condition, synchronizing and standardizing signals, and maximizing switching speed. On the other hand, recent models due to Fredkin and Toffoli show that in principle a computer could compute at finite speed with zero energy dissipation and zero error. In these models, a simple assemblage of simple but idealized mechanical parts (e.g., hard spheres and flat plates) determines a ballistic trajectory isomorphic with the desired computation, a trajectory therefore not foreseen in detail by the builder of the computer. In a classical or semiclassical setting, ballistic models are unrealistic because they require the parts to be assembled with perfect precision and isolated from thermal noise, which would eventually randomize the trajectory and lead to errors. Possibly quantum effects could be exploited to prevent this undesired equipartition of the kinetic energy. Another family of models may be called Brownian computers, because they allow thermal noise to influence the trajectory so strongly that it becomes a random walk through the entire accessible (low-potential-energy) portion of the computer's configuration space. In these computers, a simple assemblage of simple parts determines a low-energy labyrinth isomorphic to the desired computation, through which the system executes its random walk, with a slight drift velocity due to a weak driving force in the direction of forward computation. In return for their greater realism, Brownian models are more dissipative than ballistic ones: the drift velocity is proportional to the driving force, and hence the energy dissipated approaches zero only in the limit of zero speed. In this regard Brownian models resemble the traditional apparatus of thermodynamic thought experiments, where reversibility is also typically only attainable in the limit of zero speed. The enzymatic apparatus of DNA replication, transcription, and translation appear to be nature's closest approach to a Brownian computer, dissipating 20--100kT per step. Both the ballistic and Brownian computers require a change in programming style: computations must be renderedlogically reversible, so that no machine state has more than one logical predecessor. In a ballistic computer, the merging of two trajectories clearly cannot be brought about by purely conservative forces; in a Brownian computer, any extensive amount of merging of computation paths would cause the Brownian computer to spend most of its time bogged down in extraneous predecessors of states on the intended path, unless an extra driving force ofkTln2 were applied (and dissipated) at each merge point. The mathematical means of rendering a computation logically reversible (e.g., creation and annihilation of a history file) will be discussed. The old Maxwell's demon problem is discussed in the light of the relation between logical and thermodynamic reversibility: the essential irreversible step, which prevents the demon from breaking the second law, is not the making of a measurement (which in principle can be done reversibly) but rather the logically irreversible act of erasing the record of one measurement to make room for the next. Converse to the rule that logically irreversible operations on data require an entropy increase elsewhere in the computer is the fact that a tape full of zeros, or one containing some computable pseudorandom sequence such as pi, has fuel value and can be made to do useful thermodynamic work as it randomizes itself. A tape containing an algorithmically random sequence lacks this ability.},

However, many commonly used cryptosystems will be completely broken once large quantum computers exist. Post-quantum cryptography is cryptography under the assumption that the attacker has a large quantum computer; post-quantum cryptosystems strive to remain secure even in this scenario. This relatively young research area has seen some successes in identifying mathematical operations for which quantum algorithms offer little advantage in speed, and then building cryptographic systems around those. The central challenge in post-quantum cryptography is to meet demands for cryptographic usability and flexibility without sacrificing confidence.},

	abstract = {The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) is considered to be one of the most promising approaches towards using near-term quantum computers for practical application. In its original form, the algorithm applies two different Hamiltonians, called the mixer and the cost Hamiltonian, in alternation with the goal being to approach the ground state of the cost Hamiltonian. Recently, it has been suggested that one might use such a set-up as a parametric quantum circuit with possibly some other goal than reaching ground states. From this perspective, a recent work (Lloyd, arXiv:1812.11075) argued that for one-dimensional local cost Hamiltonians, composed of nearest neighbour ZZ terms, this set-up is quantum computationally universal and provides a universal gate set, i.e. all unitaries can be reached up to arbitrary precision. In the present paper, we complement this work by giving a complete proof and the precise conditions under which such a one-dimensional QAOA might produce a universal gate set. We further generalize this type of gate-set universality for certain cost Hamiltonians with ZZ and ZZZ terms arranged according to the adjacency structure of certain graphs and hypergraphs.},

However, the analogous quantum procedure (the Deutsch--Jozsa algorithm1,2) requires just one examination step. The Deutsch--Jozsa algorithm has been realized experimentally using bulk nuclear magnetic resonance techniques3,4, employing nuclear spins as quantum bits (qubits). In contrast, the ion trap processor utilises3 motional and electronic quantum states of individual atoms as qubits, and in principle is easier to scale to many qubits. Experimental advances in the latter area include the realization of a two-qubit quantum gate6, the entanglement of four ions7, quantum state engineering8 and entanglement-enhanced phase estimation9. Here we exploit techniques10,11 developed for nuclear magnetic resonance to implement the Deutsch--Jozsa algorithm on an ion-trap quantum processor, using as qubits the electronic and motional states of a single calcium ion. Our ion-based implementation of a full quantum algorithm serves to demonstrate experimental procedures with the quality and precision required for complex computations, confirming the potential of trapped ions for quantum computation.},

The Cirac--Zoller proposal1 for a scalable quantum computer is based on a string of trapped ions whose electronic states represent the quantum bits of information (or qubits). In this scheme, quantum logical gates involving any subset of ions are realized by coupling the ions through their collective quantized motion. The main experimental step towards realizing the scheme is to implement the controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate operation between two individual ions. The CNOT quantum logical gate corresponds to the XOR gate operation of classical logic that flips the state of a target bit conditioned on the state of a control bit. Here we implement a CNOT quantum gate according to the Cirac--Zoller proposal1. In our experiment, two 40Ca+ ions are held in a linear Paul trap and are individually addressed using focused laser beams2; the qubits3 are represented by superpositions of two long-lived electronic states. Our work relies on recently developed precise control of atomic phases4 and the application of composite pulse sequences adapted from nuclear magnetic resonance techniques5,6.},

The computational potential of a quantum processor can only be unleashed if errors during a quantum computation can be controlled and corrected for. Quantum error correction works if imperfections of quantum gate operations and measurements are below a certain threshold and corrections can be applied repeatedly. We implement multiple quantum error correction cycles for phase-flip errors on qubits encoded with trapped ions. Errors are corrected by a quantum-feedback algorithm using high-fidelity gate operations and a reset technique for the auxiliary qubits. Up to three consecutive correction cycles are realized, and the behavior of the algorithm for different noise environments is analyzed. },

One such task is the factorization of large integers, the technology that underpins the security of bank cards and online privacy. Using a small-scale quantum computer comprising five trapped calcium ions, Monz et al. implement a scalable version of Shor{\textquoteright}s factorization algorithm. With the function of ions being recycled and the architecture scalable, the process is more efficient than previous implementations. The approach thus provides the potential for designing a powerful quantum computer, but with fewer resources.Science, this issue p. 1068Certain algorithms for quantum computers are able to outperform their classical counterparts. In 1994, Peter Shor came up with a quantum algorithm that calculates the prime factors of a large number vastly more efficiently than a classical computer. For general scalability of such algorithms, hardware, quantum error correction, and the algorithmic realization itself need to be extensible. Here we present the realization of a scalable Shor algorithm, as proposed by Kitaev. We factor the number 15 by effectively employing and controlling seven qubits and four {\textquotedblleft}cache qubits{\textquotedblright} and by implementing generalized arithmetic operations, known as modular multipliers. This algorithm has been realized scalably within an ion-trap quantum computer and returns the correct factors with a confidence level exceeding 99\%.},

	abstract = {Hybrid classical--quantum algorithms aim to variationally solve optimization problems using a feedback loop between a classical computer and a quantum co-processor, while benefiting from quantum resources. Here we present experiments that demonstrate self-verifying, hybrid, variational quantum simulation of lattice models in condensed matter and high-energy physics. In contrast to analogue quantum simulation, this approach forgoes the requirement of realizing the targeted Hamiltonian directly in the laboratory, thus enabling the study of a wide variety of previously intractable target models. We focus on the lattice Schwinger model, a gauge theory of one-dimensional quantum electrodynamics. Our quantum co-processor is a programmable, trapped-ion analogue quantum simulator with up to 20 qubits, capable of generating families of entangled trial states respecting the symmetries of the target Hamiltonian. We determine ground states, energy gaps and additionally, by measuring variances of the Schwinger Hamiltonian, we provide algorithmic errors for the energies, thus taking a step towards verifying quantum simulation.},

	abstract = {The successful operation of quantum computers relies on protecting qubits from decoherence and noise, which---if uncorrected---will lead to erroneous results. Because these errors accumulate during an algorithm, correcting them is a key requirement for large-scale and fault-tolerant quantum information processors. Besides computational errors, which can be addressed by quantum error correction1--9, the carrier of the information can also be completely lost or the information can leak out of the computational space10--14. It is expected that such loss errors will occur at rates that are comparable to those of computational errors. Here we experimentally implement a full cycle of qubit loss detection and correction on a minimal instance of a topological surface code15,16 in a trapped-ion quantum processor. The key technique used for this correction is a quantum non-demolition measurement performed via an ancillary qubit, which acts as a minimally invasive probe that detects absent qubits while imparting the smallest quantum mechanically possible disturbance to the remaining qubits. Upon detecting qubit loss, a recovery procedure is triggered in real time that maps the logical information onto a new encoding on the remaining qubits. Although the current demonstration is performed in a trapped-ion quantum processor17, the protocol is applicable to other quantum computing architectures and error correcting codes, including leading two- and three-dimensional topological codes. These deterministic methods provide a complete toolbox for the correction of qubit loss that, together with techniques that mitigate computational errors, constitute the building blocks of complete and scalable quantum error correction.},

	abstract = {The development of quantum computing architectures from early designs and current noisy devices to fully fledged quantum computers hinges on achieving fault tolerance using quantum error correction1--4. However, these correction capabilities come with an overhead for performing the necessary fault-tolerant logical operations on logical qubits (qubits that are encoded in ensembles of physical qubits and protected by error-correction codes)5--8. One of the most resource-efficient ways to implement logical operations is lattice surgery9--11, where groups of physical qubits, arranged on lattices, can be merged and split to realize entangling gates and teleport logical information. Here we report the experimental realization of lattice surgery between two qubits protected via a topological error-correction code in a ten-qubit ion-trap quantum information processor. In this system, we can carry out the necessary quantum non-demolition measurements through a series of local and entangling gates, as well as measurements on auxiliary qubits. In particular, we demonstrate entanglement between two logical qubits and we implement logical state teleportation between them. The demonstration of these operations---fundamental building blocks for quantum computation---through lattice surgery represents a step towards the efficient realization of fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

These microscopic quantum fluctuations can induce a macroscopic phase transition in the ground state of a many-body system when the relative strength of two competing energy terms is varied across a critical value. Here we observe such a quantum phase transition in a Bose--Einstein condensate with repulsive interactions, held in a three-dimensional optical lattice potential. As the potential depth of the lattice is increased, a transition is observed from a superfluid to a Mott insulator phase. In the superfluid phase, each atom is spread out over the entire lattice, with long-range phase coherence. But in the insulating phase, exact numbers of atoms are localized at individual lattice sites, with no phase coherence across the lattice; this phase is characterized by a gap in the excitation spectrum. We can induce reversible changes between the two ground states of the system.},

	abstract = { In a Rydberg state, an atom has been very nearly, but not quite, ionized. This puts the electron relatively far from the nucleus, and two atoms in such a state can thus form a rather long-range bond. Hollerith et al. observed this phenomenon in fine detail by exciting pairs of ultracold rubidium atoms along the diagonal of an optical lattice. The authors resolved the vibrational state structure spectroscopically and showed that the Rydberg dimers manifested bond lengths exceeding 700 nanometers. Science, this issue p. 664 Weakly bound molecules with bond lengths approaching a micrometer were characterized at high resolution in an optical lattice. The subnanoscale size of typical diatomic molecules hinders direct optical access to their constituents. Rydberg macrodimers---bound states of two highly excited Rydberg atoms---feature interatomic distances easily exceeding optical wavelengths. We report the direct microscopic observation and detailed characterization of such molecules in a gas of ultracold rubidium atoms in an optical lattice. The bond length of about 0.7 micrometers, comparable to the size of small bacteria, matches the diagonal distance of the lattice. By exciting pairs in the initial two-dimensional atom array, we resolved more than 50 vibrational resonances. Using our spatially resolved detection, we observed the macrodimers by correlated atom loss and demonstrated control of the molecular alignment by the choice of the vibrational state. Our results allow for rigorous testing of Rydberg interaction potentials and highlight the potential of quantum gas microscopy for molecular physics. },

We conduct the statistical analysis of this graph and show that it also follows the power-law model. Moreover, we detect cliques and independent sets in this graph.

	abstract = {A great challenge in current quantum science and technology research is to realize artificial systems of a large number of individually controlled quantum bits for applications in quantum computing and quantum simulation. Many experimental platforms are being explored, including solid-state systems, such as superconducting circuits1 or quantum dots2, and atomic, molecular and optical systems, such as photons, trapped ions or neutral atoms3--7. The latter offer inherently identical qubits that are well decoupled from the environment and could provide synthetic structures scalable to hundreds of qubits or more8. Quantum-gas microscopes9 allow the realization of two-dimensional regular lattices of hundreds of atoms, and large, fully loaded arrays of about 50 microtraps (or `optical tweezers') with individual control are already available in one10 and two11 dimensions. Ultimately, however, accessing the third dimension while keeping single-atom control will be required, both for scaling to large numbers and for extending the range of models amenable to quantum simulation. Here we report the assembly of defect-free, arbitrarily shaped three-dimensional arrays, containing up to 72 single atoms. We use holographic methods and fast, programmable moving tweezers to arrange---atom by atom and plane by plane---initially disordered arrays into target structures of almost any geometry. These results present the prospect of quantum simulation with tens of qubits arbitrarily arranged in space and show that realizing systems of hundreds of individually controlled qubits is within reach using current technology.},

Many platforms are being developed towards this goal, in particular based on trapped ions2--4, superconducting circuits5--7, neutral atoms8--11 or molecules12,13. All of these platforms face two key challenges: scaling up the ensemble size while retaining high-quality control over the parameters, and validating the outputs for these large systems. Here we use programmable arrays of individual atoms trapped in optical tweezers, with interactions controlled by laser excitation to Rydberg states11, to implement an iconic many-body problem---the antiferromagnetic two-dimensional transverse-field Ising model. We push this platform to a regime with up to 196 atoms manipulated with high fidelity and probe the antiferromagnetic order by dynamically tuning the parameters of the Hamiltonian. We illustrate the versatility of our platform by exploring various system sizes on two qualitatively different geometries---square and triangular arrays. We obtain good agreement with numerical calculations up to a computationally feasible size (approximately 100 particles). This work demonstrates that our platform can be readily used to address open questions in many-body physics.},

Quantum logic is enacted through manipulation of the ions'internal and shared motional quantum states using optical and microwave signals. Although trapped ions show great promise for quantum-enhanced computation, sensing and communication, materials research is needed to design traps that allow for improved performance by means of integration of system components, including optics and electronics for ion-qubit control, while minimizing the near-ubiquitous electric-field noise produced by trap-electrode surfaces. In this Review, we consider the materials requirements for such integrated systems, with a focus on problems that hinder current progress towards practical quantum computation. We give suggestions for how materials scientists and trapped-ion technologists can work together to develop materials-based integration and noise-mitigation strategies to enable the next generation of trapped-ion quantum computers.},

	abstract = {A practical quantum computer must not merely store information, but also process it. To prevent errors introduced by noise from multiplying and spreading, a fault-tolerant computational architecture is required. Current experiments are taking the first steps toward noise-resilient logical qubits. But to convert these quantum devices from memories to processors, it is necessary to specify how a universal set of gates is performed on them. The leading proposals for doing so, such as magic-state distillation and colour-code techniques, have high resource demands. Alternative schemes, such as those that use high-dimensional quantum codes in a modular architecture, have potential benefits, but need to be explored further.},

	abstract = { Primary and secondary protium-to-tritium (H/T) and deuterium-to-tritium (D/T) kinetic isotope effects for the catalytic oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde by yeast alcohol dehydrogenase (YADH) at 25 degrees Celsius have been determined. Previous studies showed that this reaction is nearly or fully rate limited by the hydrogen-transfer step. Semiclassical mass considerations that do not include tunneling effects would predict that kH/kT = (kD/kT)3.26, where kH, kD, and kT are the rate constants for the reaction of protium, deuterium, and tritium derivatives, respectively. Significant deviations from this relation have now been observed for both primary and especially secondary effects, such that experimental H/T ratios are much greater than those calculated from the above expression. These deviations also hold in the temperature range from 0 to 40 degrees Celsius. Such deviations were previously predicted to result from a reaction coordinate containing a significant contribution from hydrogen tunneling. },

	abstract = {Quantum computing sits at an important inflection point. For years, high-level algorithms for quantum computers have shown considerable promise, and recent advances in quantum device fabrication offer hope of utility. A gap still exists, however, between the hardware size and reliability requirements of quantum computing algorithms and the physical machines foreseen within the next ten years. To bridge this gap, quantum computers require appropriate software to translate and optimize applications (toolflows) and abstraction layers. Given the stringent resource constraints in quantum computing, information passed between layers of software and implementations will differ markedly from in classical computing. Quantum toolflows must expose more physical details between layers, so the challenge is to find abstractions that expose key details while hiding enough complexity.},

@article{Cirac2015,
	abstract = {Can high-energy physics be simulated by low-energy, non-relativistic, many-body systems such as ultracold atoms? Such ultracold atomic systems lack the type of symmetries and dynamical properties of high energy physics models: in particular, they manifest neither local gauge invariance nor Lorentz invariance, which are crucial properties of the quantum field theories which are the building blocks of the standard model of elementary particles.

However, it turns out, surprisingly, that there are ways to configure an atomic system to manifest both local gauge invariance and Lorentz invariance. In particular, local gauge invariance can arise either as an effective low-energy symmetry, or as an exact symmetry, following from the conservation laws in atomic interactions. Hence, one could hope that such quantum simulators may lead to a new type of (table-top) experiments which will be used to study various QCD (quantum chromodynamics) phenomena, such as the confinement of dynamical quarks, phase transitions and other effects, which are inaccessible using the currently known computational methods.

In this report, we review the Hamiltonian formulation of lattice gauge theories, and then describe our recent progress in constructing the quantum simulation of Abelian and non-Abelian lattice gauge theories in 1  +  1 and 2  +  1 dimensions using ultracold atoms in optical lattices.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers require the storage of quantum information in a set of two-level systems (called qubits), the processing of this information using quantum gates and a means of final readout1. So far, only a few systems have been identified as potentially viable quantum computer models---accurate quantum control of the coherent evolution is required in order to realize gate operations, while at the same time decoherence must be avoided. Examples include quantum optical systems (such as those utilizing trapped ions2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9 or neutral atoms10,11,12, cavity quantum electrodynamics13,14,15 and nuclear magnetic resonance16,17) and solid state systems (using nuclear spins1,18, quantum dots19 and Josephson junctions20). The most advanced candidates are the quantum optical and nuclear magnetic resonance systems, and we expect that they will allow quantum computing with about ten qubits within the next few years. This is still far from the numbers required for useful applications: for example, the factorization of a 200-digit number requires about 3,500 qubits21, rising to 100,000 if error correction22 is implemented. Scalability of proposed quantum computer architectures to many qubits is thus of central importance. Here we propose a model for an ion trap quantum computer that combines scalability (a feature usually associated with solid state proposals) with the advantages of quantum optical systems (in particular, quantum control and long decoherence times).},

	abstract = {Quantum states with long-lived coherence are essential for quantum computation, simulation and metrology. The nuclear spin states of ultracold molecules prepared in the singlet rovibrational ground state are an excellent candidate for encoding and storing quantum information. However, it is important to understand all sources of decoherence for these qubits, and then eliminate them, to reach the longest possible coherence times. Here we fully characterize the dominant mechanisms of decoherence for a storage qubit in an optically trapped ultracold gas of RbCs molecules using high-resolution Ramsey spectroscopy. Guided by a detailed understanding of the hyperfine structure of the molecule, we tune the magnetic field to where a pair of hyperfine states have the same magnetic moment. These states form a qubit, which is insensitive to variations in magnetic field. Our experiments reveal a subtle differential tensor light shift between the states, caused by weak mixing of rotational states. We demonstrate how this light shift can be eliminated by setting the angle between the linearly polarized trap light and the applied magnetic field to a magic angle of {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}arccos (1/{$\backslash$}sqrt{\{}3{\}}){$\backslash$}approx 5{\{}5{\}}\^{}{\{}{$\backslash$}circ {\}}{\$}{\$}. This leads to a coherence time exceeding 5.6 s at the 95{\%} confidence level.},

In this work, we investigate and compare the capabilities of quantum versus classical models for the task of generative modelling in machine learning. We use a real world financial dataset consisting of correlated currency pairs and compare two models in their ability to learn the resulting distribution---a restricted Boltzmann machine, and a quantum circuit Born machine. We provide extensive numerical results indicating that the simulated Born machine always at least matches the performance of the Boltzmann machine in this task, and demonstrates superior performance as the model scales. We perform experiments on both simulated and physical quantum chips using the Rigetti QCSTM platform, and also are able to partially train the largest instance to date of a quantum circuit Born machine on quantum hardware. Finally, by studying the entanglement capacity of the training Born machines, we find that entanglement typically plays a role in the problem instances which demonstrate an advantage over the Boltzmann machine.},

An array of electrodes beneath the surface restrict the lateral motion of electrons. Proposed mechanisms for one and two qubit logic operations and a simultaneous readout of the final state of all qubits are discussed. The principle decay channel for the excited state is via the emission of one phonon into the bulk liquid. Dephasing is estimated to be dominated by Johnson noise in the control electrodes.

Well-separated MZMs should manifest non-Abelian braiding statistics suitable for unitary gate operations for TQC. Recent experimental work, following earlier theoretical predictions, has shown specific signatures consistent with the existence of Majorana modes localised at the ends of semiconductor nanowires in the presence of superconducting proximity effect. We discuss the experimental findings and their theoretical analyses, and provide a perspective on the extent to which the observations indicate the existence of anyonic MZMs in solid-state systems. We also discuss fractional quantum Hall systems (the 5/2 state), which have been extensively studied in the context of non-Abelian anyons and TQC. We describe proposed schemes for carrying out braiding with MZMs as well as the necessary steps for implementing TQC.},

	abstract = {Polarons---electronic charge carriers `dressed'by a local polarization of the background environment---are among the most fundamental quasiparticles in interacting many-body systems, and emerge even at the level of a single dopant1. In the context of the two-dimensional Fermi--Hubbard model, polarons are predicted to form around charged dopants in an antiferromagnetic background in the low-doping regime, close to the Mott insulating state2--7; this prediction is supported by macroscopic transport and spectroscopy measurements in materials related to high-temperature superconductivity8. Nonetheless, a direct experimental observation of the internal structure of magnetic polarons is lacking. Here we report the microscopic real-space characterization of magnetic polarons in a doped Fermi--Hubbard system, enabled by the single-site spin and density resolution of our ultracold-atom quantum simulator. We reveal the dressing of doublons by a local reduction---and even sign reversal---of magnetic correlations, which originates from the competition between kinetic and magnetic energy in the system. The experimentally observed polaron signatures are found to be consistent with an effective string model at finite temperature7. We demonstrate that delocalization of the doublon is a necessary condition for polaron formation, by comparing this setting with a scenario in which a doublon is pinned to a lattice site. Our work could facilitate the study of interactions between polarons, which may lead to collective behaviour, such as stripe formation, as well as the microscopic exploration of the fate of polarons in the pseudogap and `bad metal'phases.},

	abstract = {Recent technological advances may lead to the development of small-scale quantum computers that are capable of solving problems that cannot be tackled with classical computers. A limited number of algorithms have been proposed and their relevance to real-world problems is a subject of active investigation. Analysis of many-body quantum systems is particularly challenging for classical computers due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space dimension with the number of particles. Hence, solving the problems relevant to chemistry and condensed-matter physics is expected to be the first successful application of quantum computers. In this Article, we propose another class of problems from the quantum realm that can be solved efficiently on quantum computers: model inference for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which is important for biological and medical research. Our results are based on three interconnected studies. First, we use methods from classical machine learning to analyse a dataset of NMR spectra of small molecules. We perform stochastic neighbourhood embedding and identify clusters of spectra, and demonstrate that these clusters are correlated with the covalent structure of the molecules. Second, we propose a simple and efficient method, aided by a quantum simulator, to extract the NMR spectrum of any hypothetical molecule described by a parametric Heisenberg model. Third, we propose a simple variational Bayesian inference procedure for estimating the Hamiltonian parameters of experimentally relevant NMR spectra.},

	abstract = { Superconductivity in the cuprates emerges by doping an antiferromagnetic ``parent'' state with holes or electrons. With increased doping, antiferromagnetism gives way to unconventional superconductivity, and the system eventually becomes a Fermi liquid. Koepsell et al. simulated this progression using cold, strongly interacting lithium-6 atoms trapped in an optical lattice. Although the equivalent ordered phases are not yet reachable at the experimentally available temperatures, the researchers were able to measure multipoint spin and hole correlations over a wide range of hole doping. The evolution of these correlators with doping revealed a crossover from a polaronic regime to a Fermi liquid. ---JS Strongly interacting lithium-6 atoms in an optical lattice were imaged across a large hole doping range to reveal a crossover. The competition between antiferromagnetism and hole motion in two-dimensional Mott insulators lies at the heart of a doping-dependent transition from an anomalous metal to a conventional Fermi liquid. We observe such a crossover in Fermi-Hubbard systems on a cold-atom quantum simulator and reveal the transformation of multipoint correlations between spins and holes upon increasing doping at temperatures around the superexchange energy. Conventional observables, such as spin susceptibility, are furthermore computed from the microscopic snapshots of the system. Starting from a magnetic polaron regime, we find the system evolves into a Fermi liquid featuring incommensurate magnetic fluctuations and fundamentally altered correlations. The crossover is completed for hole dopings around 30\%. Our work benchmarks theoretical approaches and discusses possible connections to lower-temperature phenomena. },

Here, we demonstrate molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) transistors with a 1-nm physical gate length using a single-walled carbon nanotube as the gate electrode. These ultrashort devices exhibit excellent switching characteristics with near ideal subthreshold swing of ~65 millivolts per decade and an On/Off current ratio of ~106. Simulations show an effective channel length of ~3.9 nm in the Off state and ~1 nm in the On state.},

@article{Deutsch1985,
	abstract = { It is argued that underlying the Church--Turing hypothesis there is an implicit physical assertion. Here, this assertion is presented explicitly as a physical principle: `every finitely realizible physical system can be perfectly simulated by a universal model computing machine operating by finite means'. Classical physics and the universal Turing machine, because the former is continuous and the latter discrete, do not obey the principle, at least in the strong form above. A class of model computing machines that is the quantum generalization of the class of Turing machines is described, and it is shown that quantum theory and the 'universal quantum computer' are compatible with the principle. Computing machines resembling the universal quantum computer could, in principle, be built and would have many remarkable properties not reproducible by any Turing machine. These do not include the computation of non-recursive functions, but they do include `quantum parallelism', a method by which certain probabilistic tasks can be performed faster by a universal quantum computer than by any classical restriction of it. The intuitive explanation of these properties places an intolerable strain on all interpretations of quantum theory other than Everett's. Some of the numerous connections between the quantum theory of computation and the rest of physics are explored. Quantum complexity theory allows a physically more reasonable definition of the `complexity' or `knowledge' in a physical system than does classical complexity theory. },

	abstract = { Everett's relative-state construction in quantum theory has never been satisfactorily expressed in the Heisenberg picture. What one might have expected to be a straightforward process was impeded by conceptual and technical problems that we solve here. The result is a construction which, unlike Everett's one in the Schr{\"o}dinger picture, makes manifest the locality of Everettian multiplicity, its inherently approximative nature and its origin in certain kinds of entanglement and locally inaccessible information. (By Everettian, we are referring not only to Everett's own work, but also to versions of quantum theory that elaborate and refine his. The notion of relative states first appeared in Everett (Everett 1973 In The many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics (eds BS DeWitt, N Graham)). We are proposing a formalism for relative states that is more detailed and more illuminating than Everett's.) Our construction also allows us to give a more precise definition of an Everett `universe', under which it is fully quantum, not quasi-classical, and we compare the Everettian decomposition of a quantum state with the foliation of a space--time. },

	abstract = {Quantum error correction (QEC) and fault-tolerant quantum computation represent one of the most vital theoretical aspects of quantum information processing. It was well known from the early developments of this exciting field that the fragility of coherent quantum systems would be a catastrophic obstacle to the development of large-scale quantum computers. The introduction of quantum error correction in 1995 showed that active techniques could be employed to mitigate this fatal problem. However, quantum error correction and fault-tolerant computation is now a much larger field and many new codes, techniques, and methodologies have been developed to implement error correction for large-scale quantum algorithms. In response, we have attempted to summarize the basic aspects of quantum error correction and fault-tolerance, not as a detailed guide, but rather as a basic introduction. The development in this area has been so pronounced that many in the field of quantum information, specifically researchers who are new to quantum information or people focused on the many other important issues in quantum computation, have found it difficult to keep up with the general formalisms and methodologies employed in this area. Rather than introducing these concepts from a rigorous mathematical and computer science framework, we instead examine error correction and fault-tolerance largely through detailed examples, which are more relevant to experimentalists today and in the near future.},

@article{Devoret2020,
	abstract = {The accuracy of logical operations on quantum bits (qubits) must be improved for quantum computers to outperform classical ones in useful tasks. One method to achieve this is quantum error correction (QEC), which prevents noise in the underlying system from causing logical errors. This approach derives from the reasonable assumption that noise is local, that is, it does not act in a coordinated way on different parts of the physical system. Therefore, if a logical qubit is encoded non-locally, we can---for a limited time---detect and correct noise-induced evolution before it corrupts the encoded information1. In 2001, Gottesman, Kitaev and Preskill (GKP) proposed a hardware-efficient instance of such a non-local qubit: a superposition of position eigenstates that forms grid states of a single oscillator2. However, the implementation of measurements that reveal this noise-induced evolution of the oscillator while preserving the encoded information3--7 has proved to be experimentally challenging, and the only realization reported so far relied on post-selection8,9, which is incompatible with QEC. Here we experimentally prepare square and hexagonal GKP code states through a feedback protocol that incorporates non-destructive measurements that are implemented with a superconducting microwave cavity having the role of the oscillator. We demonstrate QEC of an encoded qubit with suppression of all logical errors, in quantitative agreement with a theoretical estimate based on the measured imperfections of the experiment. Our protocol is applicable to other continuous-variable systems and, in contrast to previous implementations of QEC10--14, can mitigate all logical errors generated by a wide variety of noise processes and facilitate fault-tolerant quantum computation.},

	abstract = {To date, the most promising solid-state approaches for developing quantum information-processing systems have been based on the circulating supercurrents of superconducting circuits and manipulating the spin properties of electrons in semiconductor quantum dots. Hays et al. combined the desirable aspects of both approaches, the scalability of the superconducting circuits and the compact footprint of the quantum dots, to design and fabricate a superconducting spin qubit (see the Perspective by Wendin and Shumeiko). This so-called Andreev spin qubit provides the opportunity to develop a new quantum information processing platform. Science, abf0345, this issue p. 430; see also abk0929, p. 390 The electronic excitations of low-temperature superconductors are used to realize a superconducting spin qubit. Two promising architectures for solid-state quantum information processing are based on electron spins electrostatically confined in semiconductor quantum dots and the collective electrodynamic modes of superconducting circuits. Superconducting electrodynamic qubits involve macroscopic numbers of electrons and offer the advantage of larger coupling, whereas semiconductor spin qubits involve individual electrons trapped in microscopic volumes but are more difficult to link. We combined beneficial aspects of both platforms in the Andreev spin qubit: the spin degree of freedom of an electronic quasiparticle trapped in the supercurrent-carrying Andreev levels of a Josephson semiconductor nanowire. We performed coherent spin manipulation by combining single-shot circuit--quantum-electrodynamics readout and spin-flipping Raman transitions and found a spin-flip time TS = 17 microseconds and a spin coherence time T2E = 52 nanoseconds. These results herald a regime of supercurrent-mediated coherent spin-photon coupling at the single-quantum level.},

Our scheme is potentially applicable to ion-trap and solid-state quantum technologies. We calculate a lower bound on the noise threshold for our local model using a detailed failure probability analysis. We obtain a threshold of 1.85 × 10-5 for the local setting, where memory error rates are one-tenth of the failure rates of gates, measurement, and preparation steps. For the analogous nonlocal setting, we obtain a noise threshold of 3.61 × 10-5. Our results thus show that the additional SWAP operations required to move qubits in the local model affect the noise threshold only moderately.},

Typically, RBM is trained using contrastive divergence (CD). However, training with CD is slow and does not estimate the exact gradient of the log-likelihood cost function. In this work, the model expectation of gradient learning for RBM has been calculated using a quantum annealer (D-Wave 2000Q), where obtaining samples is faster than Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) used in CD. Training and classification results of RBM trained using quantum annealing are compared with the CD-based method. The performance of the two approaches is compared with respect to the classification accuracies, image reconstruction, and log-likelihood results. The classification accuracy results indicate comparable performances of the two methods. Image reconstruction and log-likelihood results show improved performance of the CD-based method. It is shown that the samples obtained from quantum annealer can be used to train an RBM on a 64-bit ``bars and stripes'' dataset with classification performance similar to an RBM trained with CD. Though training based on CD showed improved learning performance, training using a quantum annealer could be useful as it eliminates computationally expensive MCMC steps of CD.},

Physical computation offers the opportunity to reduce the costof sampling by building physical systems whose natural dynamics correspond to drawing samples from the desired RBM distribution. Such a system avoids the burn-in and mixing cost of a Markov chain. However, hardware implementations of this variety usually entail limitations such as low-precision and limited range of the parameters and restrictions on the size and topology of the RBM. We conduct software simulations to determine how harmful each of these restrictions is. Our simulations are based on the D-Wave Two computer, but the issues we investigate arise in most forms of physical computation.Our findings suggest that designers of new physical computing hardware and algorithms for physical computers should focus their efforts on overcoming the limitations imposed by the topology restrictions of currently existing physical computers. &lt;/p&gt;},

@article{Dunjko2018,
	abstract = {Quantum information technologies, on the one hand, and intelligent learning systems, on the other, are both emergent technologies that are likely to have a transformative impact on our society in the future. The respective underlying fields of basic research---quantum information versus machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI)---have their own specific questions and challenges, which have hitherto been investigated largely independently. However, in a growing body of recent work, researchers have been probing the question of the extent to which these fields can indeed learn and benefit from each other. Quantum ML explores the interaction between quantum computing and ML, investigating how results and techniques from one field can be used to solve the problems of the other. Recently we have witnessed significant breakthroughs in both directions of influence. For instance, quantum computing is finding a vital application in providing speed-ups for ML problems, critical in our `big data' world. Conversely, ML already permeates many cutting-edge technologies and may become instrumental in advanced quantum technologies. Aside from quantum speed-up in data analysis, or classical ML optimization used in quantum experiments, quantum enhancements have also been (theoretically) demonstrated for interactive learning tasks, highlighting the potential of quantum-enhanced learning agents. Finally, works exploring the use of AI for the very design of quantum experiments and for performing parts of genuine research autonomously, have reported their first successes. Beyond the topics of mutual enhancement---exploring what ML/AI can do for quantum physics and vice versa---researchers have also broached the fundamental issue of quantum generalizations of learning and AI concepts. This deals with questions of the very meaning of learning and intelligence in a world that is fully described by quantum mechanics. In this review, we describe the main ideas, recent developments and progress in a broad spectrum of research investigating ML and AI in the quantum domain.},

	abstract = {As the field of artificial intelligence advances, the demand for algorithms that can learn quickly and efficiently increases. An important paradigm within artificial intelligence is reinforcement learning1, where decision-making entities called agents interact with environments and learn by updating their behaviour on the basis of the obtained feedback. The crucial question for practical applications is how fast agents learn2. Although various studies have made use of quantum mechanics to speed up the agent's decision-making process3,4, a reduction in learning time has not yet been demonstrated. Here we present a reinforcement learning experiment in which the learning process of an agent is sped up by using a quantum communication channel with the environment. We further show that combining this scenario with classical communication enables the evaluation of this improvement and allows optimal control of the learning progress. We implement this learning protocol on a compact and fully tunable integrated nanophotonic processor. The device interfaces with telecommunication-wavelength photons and features a fast active-feedback mechanism, demonstrating the agent's systematic quantum advantage in a setup that could readily be integrated within future large-scale quantum communication networks.},

	abstract = {Quantum mechanics is an incredibly successful theory and yet the statistical nature of its predictions is hard to accept and has been the subject of numerous debates. The notion of inherent randomness, something that happens without any cause, goes against our rational understanding of reality. To add to the puzzle, randomness that appears in non-relativistic quantum theory tacitly respects relativity, for example, it makes instantaneous signaling impossible. Here, we argue that this is because the special theory of relativity can itself account for such a random behavior. We show that the full mathematical structure of the Lorentz transformation, the one which includes the superluminal part, implies the emergence of non-deterministic dynamics, together with complex probability amplitudes and multiple trajectories. This indicates that the connections between the two seemingly different theories are deeper and more subtle than previously thought.},

Here we demonstrate an optical on-demand, reconfigurable multimode entangled state, using an intrinsically multimode quantum resource and a homodyne detection apparatus. Without altering either the initial squeezing source or experimental architecture, we realize the construction of thirteen cluster states of various sizes and connectivities as well as the implementation of a secret sharing protocol. In particular, this system enables the interrogation of quantum correlations and fluctuations for any multimode Gaussian state.

	abstract = {Topological quantum computers promise a fault tolerant means to perform quantum computation. Topological quantum computers use particles with exotic exchange statistics called non-Abelian anyons, and the simplest anyon model which allows for universal quantum computation by particle exchange or braiding alone is the Fibonacci anyon model. One classically hard problem that can be solved efficiently using quantum computation is finding the value of the Jones polynomial of knots at roots of unity. We aim to provide a pedagogical, self-contained, review of topological quantum computation with Fibonacci anyons, from the braiding statistics and matrices to the layout of such a computer and the compiling of braids to perform specific operations. Then we use a simulation of a topological quantum computer to explicitly demonstrate a quantum computation using Fibonacci anyons, evaluating the Jones polynomial of a selection of simple knots. In addition to simulating a modular circuit-style quantum algorithm, we also show how the magnitude of the Jones polynomial at specific points could be obtained exactly using Fibonacci or Ising anyons. Such an exact algorithm seems ideally suited for a proof of concept demonstration of a topological quantum computer.},

@article{Foss-Feig2021,
	abstract = {The trapped-ion quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) proposal1,2 lays out a blueprint for a universal quantum computer that uses mobile ions as qubits. Analogous to a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, which stores and processes imaging information as movable electrical charges in coupled pixels, a QCCD computer stores quantum information in the internal state of electrically charged ions that are transported between different processing zones using dynamic electric fields. The promise of the QCCD architecture is to maintain the low error rates demonstrated in small trapped-ion experiments3--5 by limiting the quantum interactions to multiple small ion crystals, then physically splitting and rearranging the constituent ions of these crystals into new crystals, where further interactions occur. This approach leverages transport timescales that are fast relative to the coherence times of the qubits, the insensitivity of the qubit states of the ion to the electric fields used for transport, and the low crosstalk afforded by spatially separated crystals. However, engineering a machine capable of executing these operations across multiple interaction zones with low error introduces many difficulties, which have slowed progress in scaling this architecture to larger qubit numbers. Here we use a cryogenic surface trap to integrate all necessary elements of the QCCD architecture---a scalable trap design, parallel interaction zones and fast ion transport---into a programmable trapped-ion quantum computer that has a system performance consistent with the low error rates achieved in the individual ion crystals. We apply this approach to realize a teleported CNOT gate using mid-circuit measurement6, negligible crosstalk error and a quantum volume7 of 26 = 64. These results demonstrate that the QCCD architecture provides a viable path towards high-performance quantum computers.},

	abstract = { The development of a practical quantum computer requires universality, scalability, and fault tolerance. Although much progress is being made in circuit platforms in which arrays of qubits are addressed and manipulated individually, scale-up of such systems is experimentally challenging. Asavanant et al. and Larsen et al. explore an alternative route: measurement-based quantum computation, which is a platform based on the generation of large-scale cluster states. As these are optically prepared and easier to handle (one simply performs local measurements on each individual component of the cluster state), such a platform is readily scalable and fault tolerant. The topology of the cluster state ensures that the approach meets the requirements for quantum computation. Science, this issue p. 373, p. 369 Two-dimensional cluster states are generated, a necessary requirement for universal quantum computing. Entanglement is the key resource for measurement-based quantum computing. It is stored in quantum states known as cluster states, which are prepared offline and enable quantum computing by means of purely local measurements. Universal quantum computing requires cluster states that are both large and possess (at least) a two-dimensional topology. Continuous-variable cluster states---based on bosonic modes rather than qubits---have previously been generated on a scale exceeding one million modes, but only in one dimension. Here, we report generation of a large-scale two-dimensional continuous-variable cluster state. Its structure consists of a 5- by 1240-site square lattice that was tailored to our highly scalable time-multiplexed experimental platform. It is compatible with Bosonic error-correcting codes that, with higher squeezing, enable fault-tolerant quantum computation. },

	abstract = {There is great interest in using quantum computers to efficiently simulate a quantum system's dynamics as existing classical computers cannot do this. Little attention, however, has been given to quantum simulation of a classical nonlinear continuum system such as a viscous fluid even though this too is hard for classical computers. Such fluids obey the Navier--Stokes nonlinear partial differential equations, whose solution is essential to the aerospace industry, weather forecasting, plasma magneto-hydrodynamics, and astrophysics. Here we present a quantum algorithm for solving the Navier--Stokes equations. We test the algorithm by using it to find the steady-state inviscid, compressible flow through a convergent-divergent nozzle when a shockwave is (is not) present. We find excellent agreement between numerical simulation results and the exact solution, including shockwave capture when present. Finally, we compare the algorithm's computational cost to deterministic and random classical algorithms and show that a significant speed-up is possible. Our work points to a large new application area for quantum computing with substantial economic impact, including the trillion-dollar aerospace industry, weather-forecasting, and engineered-plasma technologies.},

	abstract = {The main promise of quantum computing is to efficiently solve certain problems that are prohibitively expensive for a classical computer. Most problems with a proven quantum advantage involve the repeated use of a black box, or oracle, whose structure encodes the solution. One measure of the algorithmic performance is the query complexity, i.e., the scaling of the number of oracle calls needed to find the solution with a given probability. Few-qubit demonstrations of quantum algorithms, such as Deutsch--Jozsa and Grover, have been implemented across diverse physical systems such as nuclear magnetic resonance, trapped ions, optical systems, and superconducting circuits. However, at the small scale, these problems can already be solved classically with a few oracle queries, limiting the obtained advantage. Here we solve an oracle-based problem, known as learning parity with noise, on a five-qubit superconducting processor. Executing classical and quantum algorithms using the same oracle, we observe a large gap in query count in favor of quantum processing. We find that this gap grows by orders of magnitude as a function of the error rates and the problem size. This result demonstrates that, while complex fault-tolerant architectures will be required for universal quantum computing, a significant quantum advantage already emerges in existing noisy systems.},

	abstract = {Universal fault-tolerant quantum computers will require error-free execution of long sequences of quantum gate operations, which is expected to involve millions of physical qubits. Before the full power of such machines will be available, near-term quantum devices will provide several hundred qubits and limited error correction. Still, there is a realistic prospect to run useful algorithms within the limited circuit depth of such devices. Particularly promising are optimization algorithms that follow a hybrid approach: the aim is to steer a highly entangled state on a quantum system to a target state that minimizes a cost function via variation of some gate parameters. This variational approach can be used both for classical optimization problems as well as for problems in quantum chemistry. The challenge is to converge to the target state given the limited coherence time and connectivity of the qubits. In this context, the quantum volume as a metric to compare the power of near-term quantum devices is discussed. With focus on chemistry applications, a general description of variational algorithms is provided and the mapping from fermions to qubits is explained. Coupled-cluster and heuristic trial wave-functions are considered for efficiently finding molecular ground states. Furthermore, simple error-mitigation schemes are introduced that could improve the accuracy of determining ground-state energies. Advancing these techniques may lead to near-term demonstrations of useful quantum computation with systems containing several hundred qubits.},

@article{Gambetta2019,
	abstract = {Quantum computation, a paradigm of computing that is completely different from classical methods, benefits from theoretically proved speed-ups for certain problems and can be used to study the properties of quantum systems1. Yet, because of the inherently fragile nature of the physical computing elements (qubits), achieving quantum advantages over classical computation requires extremely low error rates for qubit operations, as well as substantial physical qubits, to realize fault tolerance via quantum error correction2,3. However, recent theoretical work4,5 has shown that the accuracy of computation (based on expectation values of quantum observables) can be enhanced through an extrapolation of results from a collection of experiments of varying noise. Here we demonstrate this error mitigation protocol on a superconducting quantum processor, enhancing its computational capability, with no additional hardware modifications. We apply the protocol to mitigate errors in canonical single- and two-qubit experiments and then extend its application to the variational optimization6--8 of Hamiltonians for quantum chemistry and magnetism9. We effectively demonstrate that the suppression of incoherent errors helps to achieve an otherwise inaccessible level of accuracy in the variational solutions using our noisy processor. These results demonstrate that error mitigation techniques will enable substantial improvements in the capabilities of near-term quantum computing hardware.},

However, significant technical advances will be required before a large-scale, practical quantum computer can be achieved.\nQuantum Computing: Progress and Prospects provides an introduction to the field, including the unique characteristics and constraints of the technology, and assesses the feasibility and implications of creating a functional quantum computer capable of addressing real-world problems. This report considers hardware and software requirements, quantum algorithms, drivers of advances in quantum computing and quantum devices, benchmarks associated with relevant use cases, the time and resources required, and how to assess the probability of success.},

@article{Guruswami2009,
	abstract = {We give an improved explicit construction of highly unbalanced bipartite expander graphs with expansion arbitrarily close to the degree (which is polylogarithmic in the number of vertices). Both the degree and the number of right-hand vertices are polynomially close to optimal, whereas the previous constructions of Ta-Shma et al. [2007] required at least one of these to be quasipolynomial in the optimal. Our expanders have a short and self-contained description and analysis, based on the ideas underlying the recent list-decodable error-correcting codes of Parvaresh and Vardy [2005].Our expanders can be interpreted as near-optimal ``randomness condensers,'' that reduce the task of extracting randomness from sources of arbitrary min-entropy rate to extracting randomness from sources of min-entropy rate arbitrarily close to 1, which is a much easier task. Using this connection, we obtain a new, self-contained construction of randomness extractors that is optimal up to constant factors, while being much simpler than the previous construction of Lu et al. [2003] and improving upon it when the error parameter is small (e.g., 1/poly(n)).},

@article{Henderson2020-2,
	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have rapidly risen in popularity for many machine learning applications, particularly in the field of image recognition. Much of the benefit generated from these networks comes from their ability to extract features from the data in a hierarchical manner. These features are extracted using various transformational layers, notably the convolutional layer which gives the model its name. In this work, we introduce a new type of transformational layer called a quantum convolution, or quanvolutional layer. Quanvolutional layers operate on input data by locally transforming the data using a number of random quantum circuits, in a way that is similar to the transformations performed by random convolutional filter layers. Provided these quantum transformations produce meaningful features for classification purposes, then this algorithm could be of practical use for near-term quantum computers as it requires small quantum circuits with little to no error correction. In this work, we empirically evaluated the potential benefit of these quantum transformations by comparing three types of models built on the MNIST dataset: CNNs, quantum convolutional neural networks (QNNs), and CNNs with additional non-linearities introduced. Our results showed that the QNN models had both higher test set accuracy as well as faster training compared with the purely classical CNNs.},

@article{Henriet2021,
	abstract = {In order to qualify quantum algorithms for industrial NP-Hard problems, comparing them to available polynomial approximate classical algorithms and not only to exact exponential ones is necessary. This is a great challenge as, in many cases, bounds on the reachable approximation ratios exist according to some highly-trusted conjectures of Complexity Theory. An interesting setup for such qualification is thus to focus on particular instances of these problems known to be ``less difficult''than the worst-case ones and for which the above bounds can be outperformed: quantum algorithms should perform at least as well as the conventional approximate ones on these instances, up to very large sizes. We present a case study of such a protocol for two industrial problems drawn from the strongly developing field of smart-charging of electric vehicles. Tailored implementations of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) have been developed for both problems, and tested numerically with classical resources either by emulation of Pasqal's Rydberg atom based quantum device or using Atos Quantum Learning Machine. In both cases, quantum algorithms exhibit the same approximation ratios as conventional approximation algorithms or improve them. These are very encouraging results, although still for instances of limited size as allowed by studies on classical computing resources. The next step will be to confirm them on larger instances, on actual devices, and for more complex versions of the problems addressed.},

In this paper, we report a QUBO formatting of the problem of optimal control of time-dependent traffic signals on an artificial grid-structured road network so as to ease the flow of traffic, and the use of D-Wave Systems'quantum annealer to solve it. Since current-generation D-Wave annealers have a limited number of qubits and limited inter-qubit connectivity, we adopt a hybrid (classical/quantum) approach to this problem. As traffic flow is a continuous and evolving phenomenon, we address this time-dependent problem by adopting a workflow to generate and solve multiple problem instances periodically.},

	abstract = {Quantum annealing is a promising heuristic method to solve combinatorial optimization problems, and efforts to quantify performance on real-world problems provide insights into how this approach may be best used in practice. We investigate the empirical performance of quantum annealing to solve the Nurse Scheduling Problem (NSP) with hard constraints using the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealing device. NSP seeks the optimal assignment for a set of nurses to shifts under an accompanying set of constraints on schedule and personnel. After reducing NSP to a novel Ising-type Hamiltonian, we evaluate the solution quality obtained from the D-Wave 2000Q against the constraint requirements as well as the diversity of solutions. For the test problems explored here, our results indicate that quantum annealing recovers satisfying solutions for NSP and suggests the heuristic method is potentially achievable for practical use. Moreover, we observe that solution quality can be greatly improved through the use of reverse annealing, in which it is possible to refine returned results by using the annealing process a second time. We compare the performance of NSP using both forward and reverse annealing methods and describe how this approach might be used in practice.},

In this study, we develop a method for globally controlling traffic signals arranged on a square lattice by means of a quantum annealing machine, namely the D-Wave quantum annealer. We first formulate a signal optimization problem that minimizes the imbalance of traffic flows in two orthogonal directions. Then we reformulate this problem as an Ising Hamiltonian, which is compatible with quantum annealers. The new control method is compared with a conventional local control method for a large 50-by-50 city, and the results exhibit the superiority of our global control method in suppressing traffic imbalance over wide parameter ranges. Furthermore, the solutions to the global control method obtained with the quantum annealing machine are better than those obtained with conventional simulated annealing. In addition, we prove analytically that the local and the global control methods converge at the limit where cars have equal probabilities for turning and going straight. These results are verified with numerical experiments.},

	abstract = {For successful realization of a quantum computer, its building blocks---the individual qubits---should be simultaneously scalable and sufficiently protected from environmental noise. Recently, a novel approach to the protection of superconducting qubits has been proposed. The idea is to prevent errors at the hardware level, by building a fault-free logical qubit from `faulty'physical qubits with properly engineered interactions between them. The decoupling of such a topologically protected logical qubit from local noises is expected to grow exponentially with the number of physical qubits. Here, we report on proof-of-concept experiments with a prototype device that consists of twelve physical qubits made of nanoscale Josephson junctions. We observed that owing to properly tuned quantum fluctuations, this qubit is protected against magnetic flux variations well beyond linear order, in agreement with theoretical predictions. These results suggest that topologically protected superconducting qubits are feasible.},

	abstract = {Defect-based quantum systems in wide bandgap semiconductors are strong candidates for scalable quantum-information technologies. However, these systems are often complicated by charge-state instabilities and interference by phonons, which can diminish spin-initialization fidelities and limit room-temperature operation. Here, we identify a pathway around these drawbacks by showing that an engineered quantum well can stabilize the charge state of a qubit. Using density-functional theory and experimental synchrotron X-ray diffraction studies, we construct a model for previously unattributed point defect centers in silicon carbide as a near-stacking fault axial divacancy and show how this model explains these defects'robustness against photoionization and room temperature stability. These results provide a materials-based solution to the optical instability of color centers in semiconductors, paving the way for the development of robust single-photon sources and spin qubits.},

	abstract = {The ability to accurately classify disease subtypes is of vital importance, especially in oncology where this capability could have a life saving impact. Here we report a classification between two subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer, namely Adenocarcinoma versus Squamous cell carcinoma. The data consists of approximately 20,000 gene expression values for each of 104 patients. The data was curated from Kuner (Geo lung cancer data set---gse10245, 2009, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE10245) and Golumbic (Geo lung cancer data set---gse18842, 2010, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE18842). We used a combination of classical and quantum machine learning models to successfully classify these patients. We utilized feature selection methods based on univariate statistics in addition to XGBoost (Guestrin and Chen in Xgboost: a scalable tree boosting system, 2007, https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1273596). A novel and proprietary data representation method developed by one of the authors called QCrush was also used as it was designed to incorporate a maximal amount of information under the size constraints of the D-Wave quantum annealing computer. The machine learning was performed by a quantum Boltzmann machine. This paper will report our results, the various classical methods, and the quantum machine learning approach we utilized.},

This chapter reviews the limitations of the standard computing paradigm and illustrates the concept of quantum neural computing. Implications of this idea for the understanding of biological information processing and design of new kinds of computing machines are described. Arguments are presented in support of the thesis that brains are to be viewed as quantum systems, with their neural structures representing the classical measurement hardware. From a performance point of view, a quantum neural computer may be viewed as a collection of many conventional computers that are designed to solve different problems. A quantum neural computer is a single machine that reorganizes itself, in response to a stimulus, to perform a useful computation. Selectivity offered by such reorganization appears to be at the basis of the gestalt style of biological information processing. Clearly, a quantum neural computer is more versatile than the conventional computing machine. The proposal for a quantum neural computer is based on an explicit representation of the unity of the computation process; it defines computation as a behavior in relation to other systems. The chapter introduces computation in relative terms, a perspective that appears to be appropriate for computation related to artificial intelligence (AI) problems.},

	abstract = {Realizing the potential of quantum computing requires sufficiently low logical error rates1. Many applications call for error rates as low as 10−15 (refs. 2--9), but state-of-the-art quantum platforms typically have physical error rates near 10−3 (refs. 10--14). Quantum error correction15--17 promises to bridge this divide by distributing quantum logical information across many physical qubits in such a way that errors can be detected and corrected. Errors on the encoded logical qubit state can be exponentially suppressed as the number of physical qubits grows, provided that the physical error rates are below a certain threshold and stable over the course of a computation. Here we implement one-dimensional repetition codes embedded in a two-dimensional grid of superconducting qubits that demonstrate exponential suppression of bit-flip or phase-flip errors, reducing logical error per round more than 100-fold when increasing the number of qubits from 5 to 21. Crucially, this error suppression is stable over 50 rounds of error correction. We also introduce a method for analysing error correlations with high precision, allowing us to characterize error locality while performing quantum error correction. Finally, we perform error detection with a small logical qubit using the 2D surface code on the same device18,19 and show that the results from both one- and two-dimensional codes agree with numerical simulations that use a simple depolarizing error model. These experimental demonstrations provide a foundation for building a scalable fault-tolerant quantum computer with superconducting qubits.},

	abstract = {Variational autoencoders (VAEs) are powerful generative models with the salient ability to perform inference. Here, we introduce a quantum variational autoencoder (QVAE): a VAE whose latent generative process is implemented as a quantum Boltzmann machine (QBM). We show that our model can be trained end-to-end by maximizing a well-defined loss-function: a `quantum' lower-bound to a variational approximation of the log-likelihood. We use quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations to train and evaluate the performance of QVAEs. To achieve the best performance, we first create a VAE platform with discrete latent space generated by a restricted Boltzmann machine. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on the MNIST dataset when compared against similar approaches that only involve discrete variables in the generative process. We consider QVAEs with a smaller number of latent units to be able to perform QMC simulations, which are computationally expensive. We show that QVAEs can be trained effectively in regimes where quantum effects are relevant despite training via the quantum bound. Our findings open the way to the use of quantum computers to train QVAEs to achieve competitive performance for generative models. Placing a QBM in the latent space of a VAE leverages the full potential of current and next-generation quantum computers as sampling devices.},

	abstract = {We propose a quantum generalisation of a classical neural network. The classical neurons are firstly rendered reversible by adding ancillary bits. Then they are generalised to being quantum reversible, i.e., unitary (the classical networks we generalise are called feedforward, and have step-function activation functions). The quantum network can be trained efficiently using gradient descent on a cost function to perform quantum generalisations of classical tasks. We demonstrate numerically that it can: (i) compress quantum states onto a minimal number of qubits, creating a quantum autoencoder, and (ii) discover quantum communication protocols such as teleportation. Our general recipe is theoretical and implementation-independent. The quantum neuron module can naturally be implemented photonically.},

To shed light on quantitative complexity analysis removing hidden factors, we provide a framework for estimating time--space complexity, with carefully accounting for characteristics of target cryptographic functions. Processor and circuit parallelization methods are taken into account, resulting in the time--space trade-off curves in terms of depth and qubit. The method guides how to rank different circuit designs in order of their efficiency. The framework is applied to representative cryptosystems NIST referred to as a guideline for security parameters, reassessing the security strengths of AES and SHA-2.},

	abstract = {Certain one-dimensional Fermi systems have an energy gap in the bulk spectrum while boundary states are described by one Majorana operator per boundary point. A finite system of length L possesses two ground states with an energy difference proportional to exp(-L/l0) and different fermionic parities. Such systems can be used as qubits since they are intrinsically immune to decoherence. The property of a system to have boundary Majorana fermions is expressed as a condition on the bulk electron spectrum. The condition is satisfied in the presence of an arbitrary small energy gap induced by proximity of a three-dimensional p-wave superconductor, provided that the normal spectrum has an odd number of Fermi points in each half of the Brillouin zone (each spin component counts separately).},

	abstract = {Quantum computers promise to increase greatly the efficiency of solving problems such as factoring large integers, combinatorial optimization and quantum physics simulation. One of the greatest challenges now is to implement the basic quantum-computational elements in a physical system and to demonstrate that they can be reliably and scalably controlled. One of the earliest proposals for quantum computation is based on implementing a quantum bit with two optical modes containing one photon. The proposal is appealing because of the ease with which photon interference can be observed. Until now, it suffered from the requirement for non-linear couplings between optical modes containing few photons. Here we show that efficient quantum computation is possible using only beam splitters, phase shifters, single photon sources and photo-detectors. Our methods exploit feedback from photo-detectors and are robust against errors from photon loss and detector inefficiency. The basic elements are accessible to experimental investigation with current technology.},

	abstract = {In theory, quantum computers offer a means of solving problems that would be intractable on conventional computers. Assuming that a quantum computer could be constructed, it would in practice be required to function with noisy devices called `gates'. These gates cause decoherence of the fragile quantum states that are central to the computer's operation. The goal of so-called `fault-tolerant quantum computing'is therefore to compute accurately even when the error probability per gate (EPG) is high. Here we report a simple architecture for fault-tolerant quantum computing, providing evidence that accurate quantum computing is possible for EPGs as high as three per cent. Such EPGs have been experimentally demonstrated, but to avoid excessive resource overheads required by the necessary architecture, lower EPGs are needed. Assuming the availability of quantum resources comparable to the digital resources available in today's computers, we show that non-trivial quantum computations at EPGs of as high as one per cent could be implemented.},

	abstract = {Oxidase and oxygenase enzymes allow the use of relatively unreactive O2 in biochemical reactions. Many of the mechanistic strategies used in nature for this key reaction are represented within the 2-histidine-1-carboxylate facial triad family of non-heme Fe(II)-containing enzymes. The open face of the metal coordination sphere opposite the three endogenous ligands participates directly in the reaction chemistry. Here, data from several studies are presented showing that reductive O2 activation within this family is initiated by substrate (and in some cases cosubstrate or cofactor) binding, which then allows coordination of O2 to the metal. From this starting point, the O2 activation process and the reactions with substrates diverge broadly. The reactive species formed in these reactions have been proposed to encompass four oxidation states of iron and all forms of reduced O2 as well as several of the reactive oxygen species that derive from O-O bond cleavage.},

@article{Landauer1995,
	abstract = { Technologies differ in their explicit utilization of quantum mechanical behaviour. A transistor, despite its roots in energy band structure, does not invoke quantum mechanically coherent transmission between terminals. The impressive progress in the past decade in mesoscopic physics, when combined with studies that have analysed a totally quantum mechanical computational process, suggest that we may be ready to move toward more quantum mechanical procedures for information processing. This paper is a warning signal; this possibility is beset by problems. The case will be made via two separate but complementary arguments. First, by summarizing this author's published comments on computation via totally quantum mechanical coherent Hamiltonians. The computation is likely to suffer from localization, i.e. from reflection of the computational trajectory, causing the computation to turn around. Additionally, small errors will accumulate and cause the computation to go off track. This is supplemented by analysis of specific proposals that suggest more detailed machinery than invoked in the general literature on quantum mechanical Hamiltonian computation. },

@article{Lewenstein2012,
	abstract = {Various fundamental phenomena of strongly correlated quantum systems such as high-Tc superconductivity, the fractional quantum-Hall effect and quark confinement are still awaiting a universally accepted explanation. The main obstacle is the computational complexity of solving even the most simplified theoretical models which are designed to capture the relevant quantum correlations of the many-body system of interest. In his seminal 1982 paper (Feynman 1982 Int. J. Theor. Phys. 21 467), Richard Feynman suggested that such models might be solved by `simulation' with a new type of computer whose constituent parts are effectively governed by a desired quantum many-body dynamics. Measurements on this engineered machine, now known as a `quantum simulator,' would reveal some unknown or difficult to compute properties of a model of interest. We argue that a useful quantum simulator must satisfy four conditions: relevance, controllability, reliability and efficiency. We review the current state of the art of digital and analog quantum simulators. Whereas so far the majority of the focus, both theoretically and experimentally, has been on controllability of relevant models, we emphasize here the need for a careful analysis of reliability and efficiency in the presence of imperfections. We discuss how disorder and noise can impact these conditions, and illustrate our concerns with novel numerical simulations of a paradigmatic example: a disordered quantum spin chain governed by the Ising model in a transverse magnetic field. We find that disorder can decrease the reliability of an analog quantum simulator of this model, although large errors in local observables are introduced only for strong levels of disorder. We conclude that the answer to the question `Can we trust quantum simulators?' is {\ldots} to some extent.},

This approach consists of two quantum phases, with some amount of classical preprocessing to set up the quantum problems. In the training phase we identify an optimal set of weak classifiers, to form a single strong classifier. In the testing phase we adiabatically evolve one or more strong classifiers on a superposition of inputs in order to find certain anomalous elements in the classification space. Both the training and testing phases are executed via quantum adiabatic evolution. All quantum processing is strictly limited to two-qubit interactions so as to ensure physical feasibility. We apply and illustrate this approach in detail to the problem of software verification and validation, with a specific example of the learning phase applied to a problem of interest in flight control systems. Beyond this example, the algorithm can be used to attack a broad class of anomaly detection problems.},

	abstract = {Transcription factors regulate gene expression, but how these proteins recognize and specifically bind to their DNA targets is still debated. Machine learning models are effective means to reveal interaction mechanisms. Here we studied the ability of a quantum machine learning approach to classify and rank binding affinities. Using simplified data sets of a small number of DNA sequences derived from actual binding affinity experiments, we trained a commercially available quantum annealer to classify and rank transcription factor binding. The results were compared to state-of-the-art classical approaches for the same simplified data sets, including simulated annealing, simulated quantum annealing, multiple linear regression, LASSO, and extreme gradient boosting. Despite technological limitations, we find a slight advantage in classification performance and nearly equal ranking performance using the quantum annealer for these fairly small training data sets. Thus, we propose that quantum annealing might be an effective method to implement machine learning for certain computational biology problems.},

Here we present quantum machine learning algorithms for calculating Betti numbers---the numbers of connected components, holes and voids---in persistent homology, and for finding eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the combinatorial Laplacian. The algorithms provide an exponential speed-up over the best currently known classical algorithms for topological data analysis.},

@article{Loss2007,
	abstract = {The main characteristics of good qubits are long coherence times in combination with fast operating times. It is well known that carbon-based materials could increase the coherence times of spin qubits, which are among the most developed solid-state qubits. Here, we propose how to form spin qubits in graphene quantum dots. A crucial requirement to achieve this goal is to find quantum-dot states where the usual valley degeneracy in bulk graphene is lifted. We show that this problem can be avoided in quantum dots based on ribbons of graphene with armchair boundaries. The most remarkable new feature of the proposed spin qubits is that, in an array of many qubits, it is possible to couple any two of them via Heisenberg exchange with the others being decoupled by detuning. This unique feature is a direct consequence of the quasi-relativistic spectrum of graphene.},

	abstract = {Information processing using quantum systems provides new paradigms for computation and communication and may yield insights into our understanding of the limits of quantum mechanics. However, realistic systems are never perfectly isolated from their environment, hence all quantum operations are subject to errors. Realization of a physical system for processing of quantum information that is tolerant of errors is a fundamental problem in quantum science and engineering. Here, we develop an architecture for quantum computation using electrically controlled semiconductor spins by extending the Loss--DiVincenzo scheme and by combining actively protected quantum memory and long-distance coupling mechanisms. Our approach is based on a demonstrated encoding of qubits in long-lived two-electron states, which immunizes qubits against the dominant error from hyperfine interactions. We develop a universal set of quantum gates compatible with active error suppression for these encoded qubits and an effective long-range interaction between the qubits by controlled electron transport. This approach yields a scalable architecture with favourable error thresholds for fault-tolerant operation, consistent with present experimental parameters.},

	abstract = {The key challenge in experimental quantum information science is to identify isolated quantum mechanical systems with long coherence times that can be manipulated and coupled together in a scalable fashion. We describe the coherent manipulation of an individual electron spin and nearby individual nuclear spins to create a controllable quantum register. Using optical and microwave radiation to control an electron spin associated with the nitrogen vacancy (NV) color center in diamond, we demonstrated robust initialization of electron and nuclear spin quantum bits (qubits) and transfer of arbitrary quantum states between them at room temperature. Moreover, nuclear spin qubits could be well isolated from the electron spin, even during optical polarization and measurement of the electronic state. Finally, coherent interactions between individual nuclear spin qubits were observed and their excellent coherence properties were demonstrated. These registers can be used as a basis for scalable, optically coupled quantum information systems.},

	abstract = { Trapped single atoms are ideal for storing and manipulating quantum information. Thompson et al. (p. 1202, published online 25 April; see the Perspective by Keller) were able to control single atoms interacting coherently with a field mode of a photonic crystal cavity. An optical tweezer was used to trap the single atom, which enabled positioning of the atom in close proximity to the photonic crystal waveguide, coupling the atom to the optical mode of the cavity. Such coupling should prove useful in quantum measurement, sensing, and information processing. A single rubidium atom is positioned in close proximity to an optical cavity so they can interact. [Also see Perspective by Keller] Hybrid quantum devices, in which dissimilar quantum systems are combined in order to attain qualities not available with either system alone, may enable far-reaching control in quantum measurement, sensing, and information processing. A paradigmatic example is trapped ultracold atoms, which offer excellent quantum coherent properties, coupled to nanoscale solid-state systems, which allow for strong interactions. We demonstrate a deterministic interface between a single trapped rubidium atom and a nanoscale photonic crystal cavity. Precise control over the atom's position allows us to probe the cavity near-field with a resolution below the diffraction limit and to observe large atom-photon coupling. This approach may enable the realization of integrated, strongly coupled quantum nano-optical circuits. },

	abstract = { Arrays of atoms can be a useful resource for quantum information. However, loading atoms into arrays is typically a stochastic process, which leads to imperfections. Two groups have now performed defect-free assembly of atoms into arrays (see the Perspective by Regal). The researchers first loaded the atoms stochastically and imaged the system. They then shuttled the atoms around to form perfect arrays. Barredo et al. worked with two-dimensional arrays, creating a variety of spatial configurations. Endres et al. manipulated atoms along a line. By further cooling down the atoms and generating interactions among them, the techniques may also find use in quantum simulation. Science, this issue p. 972, p. 1021; see also p. 1024 Real-time control of 100 optical tweezers leads to perfect one-dimensional arrays of more than 50 atoms of rubidium-87. The realization of large-scale fully controllable quantum systems is an exciting frontier in modern physical science. We use atom-by-atom assembly to implement a platform for the deterministic preparation of regular one-dimensional arrays of individually controlled cold atoms. In our approach, a measurement and feedback procedure eliminates the entropy associated with probabilistic trap occupation and results in defect-free arrays of more than 50 atoms in less than 400 milliseconds. The technique is based on fast, real-time control of 100 optical tweezers, which we use to arrange atoms in desired geometric patterns and to maintain these configurations by replacing lost atoms with surplus atoms from a reservoir. This bottom-up approach may enable controlled engineering of scalable many-body systems for quantum information processing, quantum simulations, and precision measurements. },

We realize a programmable Ising-type quantum spin model with tunable interactions and system sizes of up to 51 qubits. Within this model, we observe phase transitions into spatially ordered states that break various discrete symmetries, verify the high-fidelity preparation of these states and investigate the dynamics across the phase transition in large arrays of atoms. In particular, we observe robust many-body dynamics corresponding to persistent oscillations of the order after a rapid quantum quench that results from a sudden transition across the phase boundary. Our method provides a way of exploring many-body phenomena on a programmable quantum simulator and could enable realizations of new quantum algorithms.},

These fluctuations play a dominant part in the quantum critical region surrounding the transition point, where the dynamics is governed by the universal properties associated with the QPT. Although time-dependent phenomena associated with classical, thermally driven phase transitions have been extensively studied in systems ranging from the early Universe to Bose--Einstein condensates2--5, understanding critical real-time dynamics in isolated, non-equilibrium quantum systems remains a challenge6. Here we use a Rydberg atom quantum simulator with programmable interactions to study the quantum critical dynamics associated with several distinct QPTs. By studying the growth of spatial correlations when crossing the QPT, we experimentally verify the quantum Kibble--Zurek mechanism (QKZM)7--9 for an Ising-type QPT, explore scaling universality and observe corrections beyond QKZM predictions. This approach is subsequently used to measure the critical exponents associated with chiral clock models10,11, providing new insights into exotic systems that were not previously understood and opening the door to precision studies of critical phenomena, simulations of lattice gauge theories12,13 and applications to quantum optimization14,15.},

	abstract = { The success of quantum computing relies on the ability to entangle large-scale systems. Various platforms are being pursued, with architectures based on superconducting qubits and trapped atoms being the most advanced. By entangling up to 20 qubits, Omran et al. and Song et al.---working with Rydberg atom qubits and superconducting qubits, respectively---demonstrate how far these platforms have reached. The demonstrated controllable generation and detection of entanglement on such quantum systems is promising for the development of large-scale quantum processors. Science, this issue p. 570, p. 574 Entanglement of up to 20 qubits is achieved in superconducting and trapped atom platforms. Quantum entanglement involving coherent superpositions of macroscopically distinct states is among the most striking features of quantum theory, but its realization is challenging because such states are extremely fragile. Using a programmable quantum simulator based on neutral atom arrays with interactions mediated by Rydberg states, we demonstrate the creation of ``Schr{\"o}dinger cat'' states of the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) type with up to 20 qubits. Our approach is based on engineering the energy spectrum and using optimal control of the many-body system. We further demonstrate entanglement manipulation by using GHZ states to distribute entanglement to distant sites in the array, establishing important ingredients for quantum information processing and quantum metrology. },

	abstract = {Neural network-based machine learning has recently proven successful for many complex applications ranging from image recognition to precision medicine. However, its direct application to problems in quantum physics is challenging due to the exponential complexity of many-body systems. Motivated by recent advances in realizing quantum information processors, we introduce and analyse a quantum circuit-based algorithm inspired by convolutional neural networks, a highly effective model in machine learning. Our quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) uses only O(log(N)) variational parameters for input sizes of N qubits, allowing for its efficient training and implementation on realistic, near-term quantum devices. To explicitly illustrate its capabilities, we show that QCNNs can accurately recognize quantum states associated with a one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological phase, with performance surpassing existing approaches. We further demonstrate that QCNNs can be used to devise a quantum error correction scheme optimized for a given, unknown error model that substantially outperforms known quantum codes of comparable complexity. The potential experimental realizations and generalizations of QCNNs are also discussed.},

Now, two groups take a different approach and turn to synthetic systems to engineer the topological order of the so-called toric code type (see the Perspective by Bartlett). Satzinger et al. used a quantum processor to study the ground state and excitations of the toric code. Semeghini et al. detected signatures of a toric code--type quantum spin liquid in a two-dimensional array of Rydberg atoms held in optical tweezers. ---JS Topological order of the toric code type is realized in two synthetic quantum systems. Quantum spin liquids, exotic phases of matter with topological order, have been a major focus in physics for the past several decades. Such phases feature long-range quantum entanglement that can potentially be exploited to realize robust quantum computation. We used a 219-atom programmable quantum simulator to probe quantum spin liquid states. In our approach, arrays of atoms were placed on the links of a kagome lattice, and evolution under Rydberg blockade created frustrated quantum states with no local order. The onset of a quantum spin liquid phase of the paradigmatic toric code type was detected by using topological string operators that provide direct signatures of topological order and quantum correlations.

In this work, we theoretically investigate the quantum phases that can be realized by arranging such Rydberg atoms on a kagome lattice. Along with an extensive analysis of the states which break lattice symmetries due to classical correlations, we identify an intriguing regime that constitutes a promising candidate for hosting a phase with long-range quantum entanglement and topological order. Our results provide a route to experimentally realizing and probing highly entangled quantum matter.We analyze the zero-temperature phases of an array of neutral atoms on the kagome lattice, interacting via laser excitation to atomic Rydberg states. Density-matrix renormalization group calculations reveal the presence of a wide variety of complex solid phases with broken lattice symmetries. In addition, we identify a regime with dense Rydberg excitations that has a large entanglement entropy and no local order parameter associated with lattice symmetries. From a mapping to the triangular lattice quantum dimer model, and theories of quantum phase transitions out of the proximate solid phases, we argue that this regime could contain one or more phases with topological order. Our results provide the foundation for theoretical and experimental explorations of crystalline and liquid states using programmable quantum simulators based on Rydberg atom arrays.All study data are included in this article and SI Appendix.},

Using two atoms in individually controlled optical tweezers coupled to a nanofabricated photonic crystal cavity, we demonstrate entanglement generation, fast nondestructive readout, and full quantum control of atomic qubits. The entangled state is verified in free space after being transported away from the cavity by encoding the qubits into long-lived states and using dynamical decoupling.

Bluvstein et al. built an array of up to 200 Rydberg atoms and subjected the system to periodic excitation. Under such driven excitation, they found that the array of atoms stabilized, freezing periodically into what looked like time crystals. Understanding and controlling the dynamic interactions in quantum many-body systems lies at the heart of contemporary condensed matter physics and the exotic phenomena that can occur. Science, this issue p. 1355 Periodic driving of a Rydberg atom array is used to demonstrate control of quantum many-body dynamics. The control of nonequilibrium quantum dynamics in many-body systems is challenging because interactions typically lead to thermalization and a chaotic spreading throughout Hilbert space. We investigate nonequilibrium dynamics after rapid quenches in a many-body system composed of 3 to 200 strongly interacting qubits in one and two spatial dimensions. Using a programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays, we show that coherent revivals associated with so-called quantum many-body scars can be stabilized by periodic driving, which generates a robust subharmonic response akin to discrete time-crystalline order. We map Hilbert space dynamics, geometry dependence, phase diagrams, and system-size dependence of this emergent phenomenon, demonstrating new ways to steer complex dynamics in many-body systems and enabling potential applications in quantum information science. },

The interaction between the pulses is realized by means of measurement-based optoelectronic feedforward, which enhances the gain for lower-energy spin configurations. We present an efficient method of simulating the CIM on a classical computer that outperforms the CIM itself, as well as the noisy mean-field annealer in terms of both the quality of the samples and the computational speed. It is furthermore advantageous with respect to the CIM in that it can handle Ising Hamiltonians with arbitrary real-valued node coupling strengths. These results illuminate the nature of the faster performance exhibited by the CIM and may give rise to a new class of quantum-inspired algorithms of classical annealing that can successfully compete with existing methods.},

	abstract = {The Hubbard model, formulated by physicist John Hubbard in the 1960s1, is a simple theoretical model of interacting quantum particles in a lattice. The model is thought to capture the essential physics of high-temperature superconductors, magnetic insulators and other complex quantum many-body ground states2,3. Although the Hubbard model provides a greatly simplified representation of most real materials, it is nevertheless difficult to solve accurately except in the one-dimensional case2,3. Therefore, the physical realization of the Hubbard model in two or three dimensions, which can act as an analogue quantum simulator (that is, it can mimic the model and simulate its phase diagram and dynamics4,5), has a vital role in solving the strong-correlation puzzle, namely, revealing the physics of a large number of strongly interacting quantum particles. Here we obtain the phase diagram of the two-dimensional triangular-lattice Hubbard model by studying angle-aligned WSe2/WS2 bilayers, which form moir{\'e}superlattices6 because of the difference between the lattice constants of the two materials. We probe the charge and magnetic properties of the system by measuring the dependence of its optical response on an out-of-plane magnetic field and on the gate-tuned carrier density. At half-filling of the first hole moir{\'e}superlattice band, we observe a Mott insulating state with antiferromagnetic Curie--Weiss behaviour, as expected for a Hubbard model in the strong-interaction regime2,3,7--9. Above half-filling, our experiment suggests a possible quantum phase transition from an antiferromagnetic to a weak ferromagnetic state at filling factors near 0.6. Our results establish a new solid-state platform based on moir{\'e}superlattices that can be used to simulate problems in strong-correlation physics that are described by triangular-lattice Hubbard models.},

We discuss how including more physics in the algorithms and nanoscale materials used for data processing could have a major impact in the field of neuromorphic computing. We review striking results that leverage physics to enhance the computing capabilities of artificial neural networks, using resistive switching materials, photonics, spintronics and other technologies.

	abstract = { Quantum information scientists are getting closer to building a quantum computer that can perform calculations that a classical computer cannot. It has been estimated that such a computer would need around 50 qubits, but scaling up existing architectures to this number is tricky. Neill et al. explore how increasing the number of qubits from five to nine affects the quality of the output of their superconducting qubit device. If, as the number of qubits grows further, the error continues to increase at the same rate, a quantum computer with about 60 qubits and reasonable fidelity might be achievable with current technologies. Science, this issue p. 195 Scaling of errors and output with the number of qubits is explored in a five- to nine-qubit device. A key step toward demonstrating a quantum system that can address difficult problems in physics and chemistry will be performing a computation beyond the capabilities of any classical computer, thus achieving so-called quantum supremacy. In this study, we used nine superconducting qubits to demonstrate a promising path toward quantum supremacy. By individually tuning the qubit parameters, we were able to generate thousands of distinct Hamiltonian evolutions and probe the output probabilities. The measured probabilities obey a universal distribution, consistent with uniformly sampling the full Hilbert space. As the number of qubits increases, the system continues to explore the exponentially growing number of states. Extending these results to a system of 50 qubits has the potential to address scientific questions that are beyond the capabilities of any classical computer. },

	abstract = {Quantum computing can become scalable through error correction, but logical error rates only decrease with system size when physical errors are sufficiently uncorrelated. During computation, unused high energy levels of the qubits can become excited, creating leakage states that are long-lived and mobile. Particularly for superconducting transmon qubits, this leakage opens a path to errors that are correlated in space and time. Here, we report a reset protocol that returns a qubit to the ground state from all relevant higher level states. We test its performance with the bit-flip stabilizer code, a simplified version of the surface code for quantum error correction. We investigate the accumulation and dynamics of leakage during error correction. Using this protocol, we find lower rates of logical errors and an improved scaling and stability of error suppression with increasing qubit number. This demonstration provides a key step on the path towards scalable quantum computing.},

	abstract = {Error-corrected quantum computers can only work if errors are small and uncorrelated. Here, I show how cosmic rays or stray background radiation affects superconducting qubits by modeling the phonon to electron/quasiparticle down-conversion physics. For present designs, the model predicts about 57{\%} of the radiation energy breaks Cooper pairs into quasiparticles, which then vigorously suppress the qubit energy relaxation time (T1 \~{} 600 ns) over a large area (cm) and for a long time (ms). Such large and correlated decay kills error correction. Using this quantitative model, I show how this energy can be channeled away from the qubit so that this error mechanism can be reduced by many orders of magnitude. I also comment on how this affects other solid-state qubits.},

@article{McDermott2021,
	abstract = {The central challenge in building a quantum computer is error correction. Unlike classical bits, which are susceptible to only one type of error, quantum bits (qubits) are susceptible to two types of error, corresponding to flips of the qubit state about the X and Z directions. Although the Heisenberg uncertainty principle precludes simultaneous monitoring of X- and Z-flips on a single qubit, it is possible to encode quantum information in large arrays of entangled qubits that enable accurate monitoring of all errors in the system, provided that the error rate is low1. Another crucial requirement is that errors cannot be correlated. Here we characterize a superconducting multiqubit circuit and find that charge noise in the chip is highly correlated on a length scale over 600 micrometres; moreover, discrete charge jumps are accompanied by a strong transient reduction of qubit energy relaxation time across the millimetre-scale chip. The resulting correlated errors are explained in terms of the charging event and phonon-mediated quasiparticle generation associated with absorption of γ-rays and cosmic-ray muons in the qubit substrate. Robust quantum error correction will require the development of mitigation strategies to protect multiqubit arrays from correlated errors due to particle impacts.},

	abstract = {State-of-the-art cosmological simulations on classical computers are limited by time, energy, and memory usage. Quantum computers can perform some calculations exponentially faster than classical computers, using exponentially less energy and memory, and may enable extremely large simulations that accurately capture the whole dynamic range of structure in the universe within statistically representative cosmic volumes. However, not all computational tasks exhibit a ``quantum advantage.'' Quantum circuits act linearly on quantum states, so nonlinearities (e.g., self-gravity in cosmological simulations) pose a significant challenge. Here we outline one potential approach to overcome this challenge and solve the (nonlinear) Schr{\"o}dinger--Poisson equations for the evolution of self-gravitating dark matter, based on a hybrid quantum--classical variational algorithm framework (Lubasch et al.). We demonstrate the method with a proof-of-concept mock quantum simulation, envisioning a future where quantum computers will one day lead simulations of dark matter.},

Such `entangled'states explicitly demonstrate the non-local character of quantum theory1, having potential applications in high-precision spectroscopy2, quantum communication, cryptography and computation3. In general, the more particles that can be entangled, the more clearly nonclassical effects are exhibited4,5---and the more useful the states are for quantum applications. Here we implement a recently proposed entanglement technique6 to generate entangled states of two and four trapped ions. Coupling between the ions is provided through their collective motional degrees of freedom, but actual motional excitation is minimized. Entanglement is achieved using a single laser pulse, and the method can in principle be applied to any number of ions.},

@article{Monroe2020,
	abstract = {Variational quantum algorithms combine quantum resources with classical optimization methods, providing a promising approach to solve both quantum many-body and classical optimization problems. A crucial question is how variational algorithms perform as a function of qubit number. Here, we address this question by applying a variational quantum algorithm (QAOA) to approximate the ground-state energy of a long-range Ising model, both quantum and classical, and investigating the algorithm performance on a trapped-ion quantum simulator with up to 40 qubits. A negligible performance degradation and almost constant runtime scaling is observed as a function of the number of qubits. By modeling the error sources, we explain the experimental performance, marking a stepping stone toward more general realizations of hybrid quantum{\textendash}classical algorithms.Quantum computers and simulators may offer significant advantages over their classical counterparts, providing insights into quantum many-body systems and possibly improving performance for solving exponentially hard problems, such as optimization and satisfiability. Here, we report the implementation of a low-depth Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) using an analog quantum simulator. We estimate the ground-state energy of the Transverse Field Ising Model with long-range interactions with tunable range, and we optimize the corresponding combinatorial classical problem by sampling the QAOA output with high-fidelity, single-shot, individual qubit measurements. We execute the algorithm with both an exhaustive search and closed-loop optimization of the variational parameters, approximating the ground-state energy with up to 40 trapped-ion qubits. We benchmark the experiment with bootstrapping heuristic methods scaling polynomially with the system size. We observe, in agreement with numerics, that the QAOA performance does not degrade significantly as we scale up the system size and that the runtime is approximately independent from the number of qubits. We finally give a comprehensive analysis of the errors occurring in our system, a crucial step in the path forward toward the application of the QAOA to more general problem instances.August 16, 2021: The SI Appendix has been updated to coincide with a formal Correction.},

	abstract = {Quantum computing leverages the quantum resources of superposition and entanglement to efficiently solve computational problems considered intractable for classical computers. Examples include calculating molecular and nuclear structure, simulating strongly interacting electron systems, and modeling aspects of material function. While substantial theoretical advances have been made in mapping these problems to quantum algorithms, there remains a large gap between the resource requirements for solving such problems and the capabilities of currently available quantum hardware. Bridging this gap will require a co-design approach, where the expression of algorithms is developed in conjunction with the hardware itself to optimize execution. Here we describe an extensible co-design framework for solving chemistry problems on a trapped-ion quantum computer and apply it to estimating the ground-state energy of the water molecule using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE) method. The controllability of the trapped-ion quantum computer enables robust energy estimates using the prepared VQE ansatz states. The systematic and statistical errors are comparable to the chemical accuracy, which is the target threshold necessary for predicting the rates of chemical reaction dynamics, without resorting to any error mitigation techniques based on Richardson extrapolation.},

	abstract = {Quantum error correction protects fragile quantum information by encoding it into a larger quantum system1,2. These extra degrees of freedom enable the detection and correction of errors, but also increase the control complexity of the encoded logical qubit. Fault-tolerant circuits contain the spread of errors while controlling the logical qubit, and are essential for realizing error suppression in practice3--6. Although fault-tolerant design works in principle, it has not previously been demonstrated in an error-corrected physical system with native noise characteristics. Here we experimentally demonstrate fault-tolerant circuits for the preparation, measurement, rotation and stabilizer measurement of a Bacon--Shor logical qubit using 13 trapped ion qubits. When we compare these fault-tolerant protocols to non-fault-tolerant protocols, we see significant reductions in the error rates of the logical primitives in the presence of noise. The result of fault-tolerant design is an average state preparation and measurement error of 0.6 per cent and a Clifford gate error of 0.3 per cent after offline error correction. In addition, we prepare magic states with fidelities that exceed the distillation threshold7, demonstrating all of the key single-qubit ingredients required for universal fault-tolerant control. These results demonstrate that fault-tolerant circuits enable highly accurate logical primitives in current quantum systems. With improved two-qubit gates and the use of intermediate measurements, a stabilized logical qubit can be achieved.},

@article{Morello2022,
	abstract = {Nuclear spins were among the first physical platforms to be considered for quantum information processing1,2, because of their exceptional quantum coherence3 and atomic-scale footprint. However, their full potential for quantum computing has not yet been realized, owing to the lack of methods with which to link nuclear qubits within a scalable device combined with multi-qubit operations with sufficient fidelity to sustain fault-tolerant quantum computation. Here we demonstrate universal quantum logic operations using a pair of ion-implanted 31P donor nuclei in a silicon nanoelectronic device. A nuclear two-qubit controlled-Z gate is obtained by imparting a geometric phase to a shared electron spin4, and used to prepare entangled Bell states with fidelities up to 94.2(2.7){\%}. The quantum operations are precisely characterized using gate set tomography (GST)5, yielding one-qubit average gate fidelities up to 99.95(2){\%}, two-qubit average gate fidelity of 99.37(11){\%} and two-qubit preparation/measurement fidelities of 98.95(4){\%}. These three metrics indicate that nuclear spins in silicon are approaching the performance demanded in fault-tolerant quantum processors6. We then demonstrate entanglement between the two nuclei and the shared electron by producing a Greenberger--Horne--Zeilinger three-qubit state with 92.5(1.0){\%} fidelity. Because electron spin qubits in semiconductors can be further coupled to other electrons7--9 or physically shuttled across different locations10,11, these results establish a viable route for scalable quantum information processing using donor nuclear and electron spins.},

In this work, we variationally prepare the low-lying eigenstates of a non-Abelian gauge theory with dynamically coupled matter on a quantum computer. This enables the observation of hadrons and the calculation of their associated masses. The SU(2) gauge group considered here represents an important first step towards ultimately studying quantum chromodynamics, the theory that describes the properties of protons, neutrons and other hadrons. Our calculations on an IBM superconducting platform utilize a variational quantum eigensolver to study both meson and baryon states, hadrons which have never been seen in a non-Abelian simulation on a quantum computer. We develop a hybrid resource-efficient approach by combining classical and quantum computing, that not only allows the study of an SU(2) gauge theory with dynamical matter fields on present-day quantum hardware, but further lays out the premises for future quantum simulations that will address currently unanswered questions in particle and nuclear physics.},

	abstract = {A critical question for quantum computing in the near future is whether quantum devices without error correction can perform a well-defined computational task beyond the capabilities of supercomputers. Such a demonstration of what is referred to as quantum supremacy requires a reliable evaluation of the resources required to solve tasks with classical approaches. Here, we propose the task of sampling from the output distribution of random quantum circuits as a demonstration of quantum supremacy. We extend previous results in computational complexity to argue that this sampling task must take exponential time in a classical computer. We introduce cross-entropy benchmarking to obtain the experimental fidelity of complex multiqubit dynamics. This can be estimated and extrapolated to give a success metric for a quantum supremacy demonstration. We study the computational cost of relevant classical algorithms and conclude that quantum supremacy can be achieved with circuits in a two-dimensional lattice of 7 ×7 qubits and around 40 clock cycles. This requires an error rate of around 0.5{\%} for two-qubit gates (0.05{\%} for one-qubit gates), and it would demonstrate the basic building blocks for a fault-tolerant quantum computer.},

	abstract = { Topologically ordered matter exhibits long-range quantum entanglement. However, measuring this entanglement in real materials is extremely tricky. Now, two groups take a different approach and turn to synthetic systems to engineer the topological order of the so-called toric code type (see the Perspective by Bartlett). Satzinger et al. used a quantum processor to study the ground state and excitations of the toric code. Semeghini et al. detected signatures of a toric code--type quantum spin liquid in a two-dimensional array of Rydberg atoms held in optical tweezers. ---JS Topological order of the toric code type is realized in two synthetic quantum systems. The discovery of topological order has revised the understanding of quantum matter and provided the theoretical foundation for many quantum error--correcting codes. Realizing topologically ordered states has proven to be challenging in both condensed matter and synthetic quantum systems. We prepared the ground state of the toric code Hamiltonian using an efficient quantum circuit on a superconducting quantum processor. We measured a topological entanglement entropy near the expected value of --ln2 and simulated anyon interferometry to extract the braiding statistics of the emergent excitations. Furthermore, we investigated key aspects of the surface code, including logical state injection and the decay of the nonlocal order parameter. Our results demonstrate the potential for quantum processors to provide insights into topological quantum matter and quantum error correction. },

	abstract = {Scalable quantum computing can become a reality with error correction, provided that coherent qubits can be constructed in large arrays1,2. The key premise is that physical errors can remain both small and sufficiently uncorrelated as devices scale, so that logical error rates can be exponentially suppressed. However, impacts from cosmic rays and latent radioactivity violate these assumptions. An impinging particle can ionize the substrate and induce a burst of quasiparticles that destroys qubit coherence throughout the device. High-energy radiation has been identified as a source of error in pilot superconducting quantum devices3--5, but the effect on large-scale algorithms and error correction remains an open question. Elucidating the physics involved requires operating large numbers of qubits at the same rapid timescales necessary for error correction. Here, we use space- and time-resolved measurements of a large-scale quantum processor to identify bursts of quasiparticles produced by high-energy rays. We track the events from their initial localized impact as they spread, simultaneously and severely limiting the energy coherence of all qubits and causing chip-wide failure. Our results provide direct insights into the impact of these damaging error bursts and highlight the necessity of mitigation to enable quantum computing to scale.},

	abstract = {The trapped-ion quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) proposal1,2 lays out a blueprint for a universal quantum computer that uses mobile ions as qubits. Analogous to a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, which stores and processes imaging information as movable electrical charges in coupled pixels, a QCCD computer stores quantum information in the internal state of electrically charged ions that are transported between different processing zones using dynamic electric fields. The promise of the QCCD architecture is to maintain the low error rates demonstrated in small trapped-ion experiments3--5 by limiting the quantum interactions to multiple small ion crystals, then physically splitting and rearranging the constituent ions of these crystals into new crystals, where further interactions occur. This approach leverages transport timescales that are fast relative to the coherence times of the qubits, the insensitivity of the qubit states of the ion to the electric fields used for transport, and the low crosstalk afforded by spatially separated crystals. However, engineering a machine capable of executing these operations across multiple interaction zones with low error introduces many difficulties, which have slowed progress in scaling this architecture to larger qubit numbers. Here we use a cryogenic surface trap to integrate all necessary elements of the QCCD architecture---a scalable trap design, parallel interaction zones and fast ion transport---into a programmable trapped-ion quantum computer that has a system performance consistent with the low error rates achieved in the individual ion crystals. We apply this approach to realize a teleported CNOT gate using mid-circuit measurement6, negligible crosstalk error and a quantum volume7 of 26 = 64. These results demonstrate that the QCCD architecture provides a viable path towards high-performance quantum computers.},

	abstract = {Near-unity energy transfer efficiency has been widely observed in natural photosynthetic complexes. This phenomenon has attracted broad interest from different fields, such as physics, biology, chemistry, and material science, as it may offer valuable insights into efficient solar-energy harvesting. Recently, quantum coherent effects have been discovered in photosynthetic light harvesting, and their potential role on energy transfer has seen the heated debate. Here, we perform an experimental quantum simulation of photosynthetic energy transfer using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR). We show that an N-chromophore photosynthetic complex, with arbitrary structure and bath spectral density, can be effectively simulated by a system with log2 N qubits. The computational cost of simulating such a system with a theoretical tool, like the hierarchical equation of motion, which is exponential in N, can be potentially reduced to requiring a just polynomial number of qubits N using NMR quantum simulation. The benefits of performing such quantum simulation in NMR are even greater when the spectral density is complex, as in natural photosynthetic complexes. These findings may shed light on quantum coherence in energy transfer and help to provide design principles for efficient artificial light harvesting.},

The requirements for realizing such a device are confounding: scalable quantum bits (two-level quantum systems, or qubits) that can be well isolated from the environment, but also initialized, measured and made to undergo controllable interactions to implement a universal set of quantum logic gates3. The usual set consists of single qubit rotations and a controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate, which flips the state of a target qubit conditional on the control qubit being in the state 1. Here we report an unambiguous experimental demonstration and comprehensive characterization of quantum CNOT operation in an optical system. We produce all four entangled Bell states as a function of only the input qubits' logical values, for a single operating condition of the gate. The gate is probabilistic (the qubits are destroyed upon failure), but with the addition of linear optical quantum non-demolition measurements, it is equivalent to the CNOT gate required for scalable all-optical quantum computation4.},

Shor's quantum algorithm4 for fast number factoring is a key example and the prime motivator in the international effort to realize a quantum computer5. However, due to the substantial resource requirement, to date there have been only four small-scale demonstrations6,7,8,9. Here, we address this resource demand and demonstrate a scalable version of Shor's algorithm in which the n-qubit control register is replaced by a single qubit that is recycled n times: the total number of qubits is one-third of that required in the standard protocol10,11. Encoding the work register in higher-dimensional states, we implement a two-photon compiled algorithm to factor N = 21. The algorithmic output is distinguishable from noise, in contrast to previous demonstrations. These results point to larger-scale implementations of Shor's algorithm by harnessing scalable resource reductions applicable to all physical architectures.},

Its main challenges include precise control of massive circuits of linear optical components and effective implementation of entangling operations on photons. By using large-scale silicon photonic circuits to implement an extension of the linear combination of quantum operators scheme, we realize a fully programmable two-qubit quantum processor, enabling universal two-qubit quantum information processing in optics. The quantum processor is fabricated with mature CMOS-compatible processing and comprises more than 200 photonic components. We programmed the device to implement 98 different two-qubit unitary operations (with an average quantum process fidelity of 93.2 $\pm$4.5{\%}), a two-qubit quantum approximate optimization algorithm, and efficient simulation of Szegedy directed quantum walks. This fosters further use of the linear-combination architecture with silicon photonics for future photonic quantum processors.},

Two ground state hyperfine levels, with hour long lifetimes and ms decoherence times are chosen as qubit states. Controlled logic between the qubits is accomplished using the change in permanent dipole moment induced by an optical transition between the ground and excited state of these ions. The scheme is based on existing material data and established measurement techniques and should therefore be straightforward to realise in practice. The procedure used for creating the qubits can be generalised also to other solid state systems.},

	abstract = { Superconducting qubits are leading candidates in the race to build a quantum computer capable of realizing computations beyond the reach of modern supercomputers. The superconducting qubit modality has been used to demonstrate prototype algorithms in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) technology era, in which non-error-corrected qubits are used to implement quantum simulations and quantum algorithms. With the recent demonstrations of multiple high-fidelity, two-qubit gates as well as operations on logical qubits in extensible superconducting qubit systems, this modality also holds promise for the longer-term goal of building larger-scale error-corrected quantum computers. In this brief review, we discuss several of the recent experimental advances in qubit hardware, gate implementations, readout capabilities, early NISQ algorithm implementations, and quantum error correction using superconducting qubits. Although continued work on many aspects of this technology is certainly necessary, the pace of both conceptual and technical progress in recent years has been impressive, and here we hope to convey the excitement stemming from this progress. },

Here we study the dielectric loss of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) thin films in the microwave regime by measuring the quality factor of parallel-plate capacitors (PPCs) made of NbSe2--hBN--NbSe2 heterostructures integrated into superconducting circuits. The extracted microwave loss tangent of hBN is bounded to be at most in the mid-10−6 range in the low-temperature, single-photon regime. We integrate hBN PPCs with aluminium Josephson junctions to realize transmon qubits with coherence times reaching 25 μs, consistent with the hBN loss tangent inferred from resonator measurements. The hBN PPC reduces the qubit feature size by approximately two orders of magnitude compared with conventional all-aluminium coplanar transmons. Our results establish hBN as a promising dielectric for building high-coherence quantum circuits with substantially reduced footprint and with a high energy participation that helps to reduce unwanted qubit cross-talk.},

For further improvement and application of these solvers, it is important to clarify the differences in their performance for various types of problems. In this study, the performance of four quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem solvers, namely D-Wave Hybrid Solver Service (HSS), Toshiba Simulated Bifurcation Machine (SBM), Fujitsu Digital Annealer (DA), and simulated annealing on a personal computer, was benchmarked. The problems used for benchmarking were instances of real problems in MQLib, instances of the SAT-UNSAT phase transition point of random not-all-equal 3-SAT (NAE 3-SAT), and the Ising spin glass Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model. Concerning MQLib instances, the HSS performance ranked first; for NAE 3-SAT, DA performance ranked first; and regarding the SK model, SBM performance ranked first. These results may help understand the strengths and weaknesses of these solvers.},

	abstract = {Scalable quantum computing can be achieved only if quantum bits are manipulated in a fault-tolerant fashion. Topological error correction---a method that combines topological quantum computation with quantum error correction---has the highest known tolerable error rate for a local architecture. The technique makes use of cluster states with topological properties and requires only nearest-neighbour interactions. Here we report the experimental demonstration of topological error correction with an eight-photon cluster state. We show that a correlation can be protected against a single error on any quantum bit. Also, when all quantum bits are simultaneously subjected to errors with equal probability, the effective error rate can be significantly reduced. Our work demonstrates the viability of topological error correction for fault-tolerant quantum information processing.},

	abstract = {Ring exchange is an elementary interaction for modelling unconventional topological matter. Here, we report the observation of four-body ring-exchange interactions and the topological properties of anyonic excitations within an ultracold atom system. A minimum toric-code Hamiltonian, in which the ring exchange is the dominant term, was implemented in disconnected four-spin plaquette arrays formed by two orthogonal superlattices. The ring-exchange interactions were resolved from the dynamical evolutions of the spin orders in each plaquette, matching well with the predicted energy gaps between two anyonic excitations of the spin system. A braiding operation was applied to the spins in the plaquettes and an induced phase 1.00(3)πin the four-spin state was observed, confirming 1/2 mutual statistics. This work offers new prospects for the quantum simulation of topological phases by engineering many-body interactions.},

	abstract = {Quantum computational advantage or supremacy is a long-anticipated milestone toward practical quantum computers. Recent work claimed to have reached this point, but subsequent work managed to speed up the classical simulation and pointed toward a sample size{\textendash}dependent loophole. Quantum computational advantage, rather than being a one-shot experimental proof, will be the result of a long-term competition between quantum devices and classical simulation. Zhong et al. sent 50 indistinguishable single-mode squeezed states into a 100-mode ultralow-loss interferometer and sampled the output using 100 high-efficiency single-photon detectors. By obtaining up to 76-photon coincidence, yielding a state space dimension of about 1030, they measured a sampling rate that is about 1014-fold faster than using state-of-the-art classical simulation strategies and supercomputers.Science, this issue p. 1460Quantum computers promise to perform certain tasks that are believed to be intractable to classical computers.

Historically rooted in the famous quantum jump of the Old Quantum Theory, the transition idea survives today in experimental jargon due to (1) the notion of uncontrollable disturbance of a system by measurement operations and (2) the wave-packet reduction hypothesis in several forms. Explicit counterexamples to both (1) and (2) are presented in terms of quantum measurement theory. It is concluded that the idea of transition, or quantum jump, can no longer be rationally comprehended within the framework of contemporary physical theory.},

	abstract = {RSA cryptography is based on the difficulty of factoring large integers, which is an NP-hard (and hence intractable) problem for a classical computer. However, Shor's algorithm shows that its complexity is polynomial for a quantum computer, although technical difficulties mean that practical quantum computers that can tackle integer factorizations of meaningful size are still a long way away. Recently, Jiang et al. proposed a transformation that maps the integer factorization problem onto the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) model. They tested their algorithm on a D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealing machine, raising the record for a quantum factorized integer to 376289 with only 94 qubits. In this study, we optimize the problem Hamiltonian to reduce the number of qubits involved in the final Hamiltonian while maintaining the QUBO coefficients in a reasonable range, enabling the improved algorithm to factorize larger integers with fewer qubits. Tests of our improved algorithm using D-Wave's hybrid quantum/classical simulator qbsolv confirmed that performance was improved, and we were able to factorize 1005973, a new record for quantum factorized integers, with only 89 qubits. In addition, our improved algorithm can tolerate more errors than the original one. Factoring 1005973 using Shor's algorithm would require about 41 universal qubits, which current universal quantum computers cannot reach with acceptable accuracy. In theory, the latest IBM Q System OneTM (Jan. 2019) can only factor up to 10-bit integers, while the D-Wave have a thousand-fold advantage on the factoring scale. This shows that quantum annealing machines, such as those by D-Wave, may be close to cracking practical RSA codes, while universal quantum-circuit-based computers may be many years away from attacking RSA.},

@article{Perdomo-Ortiz2018,
	abstract = {With quantum computing technologies nearing the era of commercialization and quantum supremacy, machine learning (ML) appears as one of the promising `killer' applications. Despite significant effort, there has been a disconnect between most quantum ML proposals, the needs of ML practitioners, and the capabilities of near-term quantum devices to demonstrate quantum enhancement in the near future. In this contribution to the focus collection `What would you do with 1000 qubits?', we provide concrete examples of intractable ML tasks that could be enhanced with near-term devices. We argue that to reach this target, the focus should be on areas where ML researchers are struggling, such as generative models in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning, instead of the popular and more tractable supervised learning techniques. We also highlight the case of classical datasets with potential quantum-like statistical correlations where quantum models could be more suitable. We focus on hybrid quantum--classical approaches and illustrate some of the key challenges we foresee for near-term implementations. Finally, we introduce the quantum-assisted Helmholtz machine (QAHM), an attempt to use near-term quantum devices to tackle high-dimensional datasets of continuous variables. Instead of using quantum computers to assist deep learning, as previous approaches do, the QAHM uses deep learning to extract a low-dimensional binary representation of data, suitable for relatively small quantum processors which can assist the training of an unsupervised generative model. Although we illustrate this concept on a quantum annealer, other quantum platforms could benefit as well from this hybrid quantum--classical framework.},

@article{Poplavski1975,
	abstract = {This review considers the thermodynamic aspects of the theory of information processes---measurement, transmission of information, and its processing. Considerable attention is given to an explanation of the limiting relations between the accuracy of a physical measurement and the ensuing energy degradation. Hence, in particular, a relation is established between physical entropy and quantity of information. These results are used to determine the energy cost of information transmission with allowance for the energy expenditures on decoding. The process of information processing (computational process) is treated as indirect measurement, and on the basis of this model the energetic complexity of the process is determined (the minimum value of the energy that must be degraded in order to realize the prescribed processing with the necessary accuracy).},

Furthermore, it briefly presents the 20 projects selected to be at the core of the ramp-up phase of the initiative, which will address core applications of quantum technologies such as communications, computing, simulation, as well as sensing and metrology, all of which are supported by basic science. Finally, we present the broader ecosystem of European funding instruments and institutions which aim to create the next generation of disruptive technologies within quantum sciences, placing Europe as a worldwide knowledge-based industrial and technological leader in this innovative field.},

Practical issues likely to affect the computation include precision limitations, finite temperature, bounded energy range, sparse connectivity, and small numbers of qubits. To address these concerns we propose a way of finding energy representations with large classical gaps between ground and first excited states, efficient algorithms for mapping non-compatible Ising models into the hardware, and the use of decomposition methods for problems that are too large to fit in hardware. We validate the approach by describing experiments with D-Wave quantum hardware for low density parity check decoding with up to 1000 variables.},

Compared to qubit, qudit provides a larger state space to store and process information, and thus can provide reduction of the circuit complexity, simplification of the experimental setup and enhancement of the algorithm efficiency. This review provides an overview of qudit-based quantum computing covering a variety of topics ranging from circuit building, algorithm design, to experimental methods. We first discuss the qudit gate universality and a variety of qudit gates including the pi/8 gate, the SWAP gate, and the multi-level controlled-gate. We then present the qudit version of several representative quantum algorithms including the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, the quantum Fourier transform, and the phase estimation algorithm. Finally we discuss various physical realizations for qudit computation such as the photonic platform, iron trap, and nuclear magnetic resonance.},

We use a publication set of 54,598 papers from Web of Science, published between 1980 and 2018, to investigate the time development of four main subfields of quantum technology in terms of numbers and shares of publications, as well as the occurrence of topics and their relation to the 25 top contributing countries. Three successive time periods are distinguished in the analyses by their short doubling times in relation to the whole Web of Science. The periods can be characterized by the publication of pioneering works, the exploration of research topics, and the maturing of quantum technology, respectively. Compared to the USA, China's contribution to the worldwide publication output is overproportionate, but not in the segment of highly cited papers.},

It is the crucial initial step for essentially all atomic gas experiments in which Bose--Einstein condensation and, more generally, quantum degeneracy is reached. The ongoing development of laser-cooling methods has allowed more elements to be brought to quantum degeneracy, with each additional atomic species offering its own experimental opportunities. Improved methods are opening new avenues, for example, reaching Bose--Einstein condensation purely through laser cooling as well as the realization of continuous Bose--Einstein condensation. Here we review these recent innovations in laser cooling and provide an outlook on methods that may enable new ways of creating quantum gases.},

	abstract = {Quantum machine learning witnesses an increasing amount of quantum algorithms for data-driven decision making, a problem with potential applications ranging from automated image recognition to medical diagnosis. Many of those algorithms are implementations of quantum classifiers, or models for the classification of data inputs with a quantum computer. Following the success of collective decision making with ensembles in classical machine learning, this paper introduces the concept of quantum ensembles of quantum classifiers. Creating the ensemble corresponds to a state preparation routine, after which the quantum classifiers are evaluated in parallel and their combined decision is accessed by a single-qubit measurement. This framework naturally allows for exponentially large ensembles in which --similar to Bayesian learning --the individual classifiers do not have to be trained. As an example, we analyse an exponentially large quantum ensemble in which each classifier is weighed according to its performance in classifying the training data, leading to new results for quantum as well as classical machine learning.},

	abstract = {Growing interest in quantum computing for practical applications has led to a surge in the availability of programmable machines for executing quantum algorithms1,2. Present-day photonic quantum computers3--7 have been limited either to non-deterministic operation, low photon numbers and rates, or fixed random gate sequences. Here we introduce a full-stack hardware−software system for executing many-photon quantum circuit operations using integrated nanophotonics: a programmable chip, operating at room temperature and interfaced with a fully automated control system. The system enables remote users to execute quantum algorithms that require up to eight modes of strongly squeezed vacuum initialized as two-mode squeezed states in single temporal modes, a fully general and programmable four-mode interferometer, and photon number-resolving readout on all outputs. Detection of multi-photon events with photon numbers and rates exceeding any previous programmable quantum optical demonstration is made possible by strong squeezing and high sampling rates. We verify the non-classicality of the device output, and use the platform to carry out proof-of-principle demonstrations of three quantum algorithms: Gaussian boson sampling, molecular vibronic spectra and graph similarity8. These demonstrations validate the platform as a launchpad for scaling photonic technologies for quantum information processing.},

A systematic study on the excitation laser pulse duration depicts that a sufficiently small laser linewidth enables a substantial improved single-photon-to-laser-background ratio inside a waveguide chip. This manifests in the observation of clear Rabi oscillations over two periods of the quantum dot emission as a function of laser excitation power. A photon cross-correlation measurement between the two output arms of an on-chip beamsplitter results in a g(2)(0)$=$0.18, demonstrating the generation, guiding and splitting of triggered single photons under resonant excitation in an on-chip device. The present results open new perspectives for the implementation of photonic quantum circuits with integrated quantum dots as resonantly-pumped deterministic single-photon sources.},

	abstract = {Numerous scientific and engineering applications require numerically solving systems of equations. Classically solving a general set of polynomial equations requires iterative solvers, while linear equations may be solved either by direct matrix inversion or iteratively with judicious preconditioning. However, the convergence of iterative algorithms is highly variable and depends, in part, on the condition number. We present a direct method for solving general systems of polynomial equations based on quantum annealing, and we validate this method using a system of second-order polynomial equations solved on a commercially available quantum annealer. We then demonstrate applications for linear regression, and discuss in more detail the scaling behavior for general systems of linear equations with respect to problem size, condition number, and search precision. Finally, we define an iterative annealing process and demonstrate its efficacy in solving a linear system to a tolerance of 10−8.},

	abstract = { Quantum computation requires controlled engineering of quantum states to perform tasks that go beyond those possible with classical computers. Topological quantum computation aims to achieve this goal by using non-Abelian quantum phases of matter. Such phases allow for quantum information to be stored and manipulated in a nonlocal manner, which protects it from imperfections in the implemented protocols and from interactions with the environment. Recently, substantial progress in this field has been made on both theoretical and experimental fronts. We review the basic concepts of non-Abelian phases and their topologically protected use in quantum information processing tasks. We discuss different possible realizations of these concepts in experimentally available solid-state systems, including systems hosting Majorana fermions, their recently proposed fractional counterparts, and non-Abelian quantum Hall states. },

	abstract = {Recent successes in producing intermediate-scale quantum devices have focused interest on establishing whether near-term devices could outperform classical computers for practical applications. A central question is whether noise can be overcome in the absence of quantum error correction or if it fundamentally restricts any potential quantum advantage. We present a transparent way of comparing classical and quantum algorithms running on noisy devices for a large family of tasks that includes optimization and variational eigenstate solving. Our approach is based on entropic inequalities that determine how fast the quantum state converges to the fixed point of the noise model, together with established classical methods of Gibbs state simulation. Our techniques are extremely versatile and so may be applied to a large variety of algorithms, noise models and quantum computing architectures. We use our result to provide estimates for problems within reach of current experiments, such as quantum annealers or variational quantum algorithms. The bounds we obtain indicate that substantial quantum advantages are unlikely for classical optimization unless noise rates are decreased by orders of magnitude or the topology of the problem matches that of the device. This is the case even if the number of available qubits increases substantially.},

	abstract = { Finding the optimum solution of multiparameter or multifunctional problems is important across many disciplines, but it can be computationally intensive. Many such problems defined as computationally difficult can be mathematically mapped onto the so-called Ising problem, which looks at finding the minimum energy configuration for an array of coupled spins. Inagaki et al. and McMahon et al. show that an optical processing approach based on a network of coupled optical pulses in a ring fiber can be used to model and optimize large-scale Ising systems. Such a scalable architecture could help to optimize solutions to a wide range of complex problems. Science, this issue pp. 603 and 614 An optical-based processor is developed to solve a broad class of complex optimization problems. The analysis and optimization of complex systems can be reduced to mathematical problems collectively known as combinatorial optimization. Many such problems can be mapped onto ground-state search problems of the Ising model, and various artificial spin systems are now emerging as promising approaches. However, physical Ising machines have suffered from limited numbers of spin-spin couplings because of implementations based on localized spins, resulting in severe scalability problems. We report a 2000-spin network with all-to-all spin-spin couplings. Using a measurement and feedback scheme, we coupled time-multiplexed degenerate optical parametric oscillators to implement maximum cut problems on arbitrary graph topologies with up to 2000 nodes. Our coherent Ising machine outperformed simulated annealing in terms of accuracy and computation time for a 2000-node complete graph. },

	abstract = {Fault-tolerant quantum computers that can solve hard problems rely on quantum error correction1. One of the most promising error correction codes is the surface code2, which requires universal gate fidelities exceeding an error correction threshold of 99 per cent3. Among the many qubit platforms, only superconducting circuits4, trapped ions5 and nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond6 have delivered this requirement. Electron spin qubits in silicon7--15 are particularly promising for a large-scale quantum computer owing to their nanofabrication capability, but the two-qubit gate fidelity has been limited to 98 per cent owing to the slow operation16. Here we demonstrate a two-qubit gate fidelity of 99.5 per cent, along with single-qubit gate fidelities of 99.8 per cent, in silicon spin qubits by fast electrical control using a micromagnet-induced gradient field and a tunable two-qubit coupling. We identify the qubit rotation speed and coupling strength where we robustly achieve high-fidelity gates. We realize Deutsch--Jozsa and Grover search algorithms with high success rates using our universal gate set. Our results demonstrate universal gate fidelity beyond the fault-tolerance threshold and may enable scalable silicon quantum computers.},

	abstract = {Quantum chemistry is regarded to be one of the first disciplines that will be revolutionized by quantum computing. Although universal quantum computers of practical scale may be years away, various approaches are currently being pursued to solve quantum chemistry problems on near-term gate-based quantum computers and quantum annealers by developing the appropriate algorithm and software base. This work implements the general Quantum Annealer Eigensolver (QAE) algorithm to solve the molecular electronic Hamiltonian eigenvalue-eigenvector problem on a D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer. The approach is based on the matrix formulation, efficiently uses qubit resources based on a power-of-two encoding scheme and is hardware-dominant relying on only one classically optimized parameter. We demonstrate the use of D-Wave hardware for obtaining ground and excited electronic states across a variety of small molecular systems. The approach can be adapted for use by a vast majority of electronic structure methods currently implemented in conventional quantum-chemical packages. The results of this work will encourage further development of software such as qbsolv which has promising applications in emerging quantum information processing hardware and has expectation to address large and complex optimization problems intractable for classical computers.},

However, intermediate quantum computational models3,4,5 have been proposed that are not universal but can solve problems that are believed to be classically hard. Aaronson and Arkhipov6 have shown that interference of single photons in random optical networks can solve the hard problem of sampling the bosonic output distribution. Remarkably, this computation does not require measurement-based interactions7,8 or adaptive feed-forward techniques9. Here, we demonstrate this model of computation using laser-written integrated quantum networks that were designed to implement unitary matrix transformations. We characterize the integrated devices using an in situ reconstruction method and observe three-photon interference10,11,12 that leads to the boson-sampling output distribution. Our results set a benchmark for a type of quantum computer with the potential to outperform a conventional computer through the use of only a few photons and linear-optical elements13.},

One particular area at risk is cryptocurrencies, a market currently worth over 100 billion USD. We investigate the risk posed to Bitcoin, and other cryptocurrencies, by attacks using quantum computers. We find that the proof-of-work used by Bitcoin is relatively resistant to substantial speedup by quantum computers in the next 10 years, mainly because specialized ASIC miners are extremely fast compared to the estimated clock speed of near-term quantum computers. On the other hand, the elliptic curve signature scheme used by Bitcoin is much more at risk, and could be completely broken by a quantum computer as early as 2027, by the most optimistic estimates. We analyze an alternative proof-of-work called Momentum, based on finding collisions in a hash function, that is even more resistant to speedup by a quantum computer. We also review the available post-quantum signature schemes to see which one would best meet the security and efficiency requirements of blockchain applications.&lt;/p&#38;gt;},

	abstract = {A single-photon source is an enabling technology in device-independent quantum communication1, quantum simulation2,3, and linear optics-based4 and measurement-based quantum computing5. These applications employ many photons and place stringent requirements on the efficiency of single-photon creation. The scaling on efficiency is typically an exponential function of the number of photons. Schemes taking full advantage of quantum superpositions also depend sensitively on the coherence of the photons, that is, their indistinguishability6. Here, we report a single-photon source with a high end-to-end efficiency. We employ gated quantum dots in an open, tunable microcavity7. The gating provides control of the charge and electrical tuning of the emission frequency; the high-quality material ensures low noise; and the tunability of the microcavity compensates for the lack of control in quantum dot position and emission frequency. Transmission through the top mirror is the dominant escape route for photons from the microcavity, and this output is well matched to a single-mode fibre. With this design, we can create a single photon at the output of the final optical fibre on-demand with a probability of up to 57{\%} and with an average two-photon interference visibility of 97.5{\%}. Coherence persists in trains of thousands of photons with single-photon creation at a repetition rate of 1 GHz.},

A quantum annealer, in particular, solves optimization problems by evolving a known initial configuration at non-zero temperature towards the ground state of a Hamiltonian encoding a given problem. Here, we present results from tests on a 108 qubit D-Wave One device based on superconducting flux qubits. By studying correlations we find that the device performance is inconsistent with classical annealing or that it is governed by classical spin dynamics. In contrast, we find that the device correlates well with simulated quantum annealing. We find further evidence for quantum annealing in the form of small-gap avoided level crossings characterizing the hard problems. To assess the computational power of the device we compare it against optimized classical algorithms.},

They define various types of quantum speedup and consider quantum processors that are designed to solve a specific class of problems. Science, this issue p. 420 What makes a quantum machine quantum? The development of small-scale quantum devices raises the question of how to fairly assess and detect quantum speedup. Here, we show how to define and measure quantum speedup and how to avoid pitfalls that might mask or fake such a speedup. We illustrate our discussion with data from tests run on a D-Wave Two device with up to 503 qubits. By using random spin glass instances as a benchmark, we found no evidence of quantum speedup when the entire data set is considered and obtained inconclusive results when comparing subsets of instances on an instance-by-instance basis. Our results do not rule out the possibility of speedup for other classes of problems and illustrate the subtle nature of the quantum speedup question. },

Although quantum chemistry is a strong candidate, the lack of details of how quantum computers can be used for specific applications makes it difficult to assess whether they will be able to deliver on the promises. Here, we show how quantum computers can be used to elucidate the reaction mechanism for biological nitrogen fixation in nitrogenase, by augmenting classical calculation of reaction mechanisms with reliable estimates for relative and activation energies that are beyond the reach of traditional methods. We also show that, taking into account overheads of quantum error correction and gate synthesis, a modular architecture for parallel quantum computers can perform such calculations with components of reasonable complexity.With rapid recent advances in quantum technology, we are close to the threshold of quantum devices whose computational powers can exceed those of classical supercomputers. Here, we show that a quantum computer can be used to elucidate reaction mechanisms in complex chemical systems, using the open problem of biological nitrogen fixation in nitrogenase as an example. We discuss how quantum computers can augment classical computer simulations used to probe these reaction mechanisms, to significantly increase their accuracy and enable hitherto intractable simulations. Our resource estimates show that, even when taking into account the substantial overhead of quantum error correction, and the need to compile into discrete gate sets, the necessary computations can be performed in reasonable time on small quantum computers. Our results demonstrate that quantum computers will be able to tackle important problems in chemistry without requiring exorbitant resources.},

They are used by newcomers and seasoned practitioners, researchers and developers working on the next ground-breaking discovery or applying known concepts to real-world problems.

	abstract = {Superconducting integrated circuits have demonstrated a tremendous potential to realize integrated quantum computing processors. However, the downside of the solid-state approach is that superconducting qubits suffer strongly from energy dissipation and environmental fluctuations caused by atomic-scale defects in device materials. Further progress towards upscaled quantum processors will require improvements in device fabrication techniques, which need to be guided by novel analysis methods to understand and prevent mechanisms of defect formation. Here, we present a technique to analyse individual defects in superconducting qubits by tuning them with applied electric fields. This provides a spectroscopy method to extract the defects'energy distribution, electric dipole moments, and coherence times. Moreover, it enables one to distinguish defects residing in Josephson junction tunnel barriers from those at circuit interfaces. We find that defects at circuit interfaces are responsible for about 60{\%} of the dielectric loss in the investigated transmon qubit sample. About 40{\%} of all detected defects are contained in the tunnel barriers of the large-area parasitic Josephson junctions that occur collaterally in shadow evaporation, and only {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}approx{\$}{\$}3{\%} are identified as strongly coupled defects, which presumably reside in the small-area qubit tunnel junctions. The demonstrated technique provides a valuable tool to assess the decoherence sources related to circuit interfaces and to tunnel junctions that is readily applicable to standard qubit samples.},

The system has been implemented as a planar integral electric circuit, where the fluxonium qubit itself consists of a tunnel Josephson junction with a small area shunted by a high inductance of a series of Josephson junctions with larger areas. To analyze the experimental data, an extended model of the fluxonium qubit capacitively coupled to the resonator has been proposed, and the structure of the energy levels has been obtained by full diagonalization of the Hamiltonian of the system.

	abstract = {Solid-state quantum coherent devices are quickly progressing. Superconducting circuits, for instance, have already been used to demonstrate prototype quantum processors comprising a few tens of quantum bits. This development also revealed that a major part of decoherence and energy loss in such devices originates from a bath of parasitic material defects. However, neither the microscopic structure of defects nor the mechanisms by which they emerge during sample fabrication are understood. Here, we present a technique to obtain information on locations of defects relative to the thin film edge of the qubit circuit. Resonance frequencies of defects are tuned by exposing the qubit sample to electric fields generated by electrodes surrounding the chip. By determining the defect's coupling strength to each electrode and comparing it to a simulation of the field distribution, we obtain the probability at which location and at which interface the defect resides. This method is applicable to already existing samples of various qubit types, without further on-chip design changes. It provides a valuable tool for improving the material quality and nano-fabrication procedures towards more coherent quantum circuits.},

	abstract = {High-fidelity control of quantum bits is paramount for the reliable execution of quantum algorithms and for achieving fault tolerance---the ability to correct errors faster than they occur1. The central requirement for fault tolerance is expressed in terms of an error threshold. Whereas the actual threshold depends on many details, a common target is the approximately 1{\%} error threshold of the well-known surface code2,3. Reaching two-qubit gate fidelities above 99{\%} has been a long-standing major goal for semiconductor spin qubits. These qubits are promising for scaling, as they can leverage advanced semiconductor technology4. Here we report a spin-based quantum processor in silicon with single-qubit and two-qubit gate fidelities, all of which are above 99.5{\%}, extracted from gate-set tomography. The average single-qubit gate fidelities remain above 99{\%} when including crosstalk and idling errors on the neighbouring qubit. Using this high-fidelity gate set, we execute the demanding task of calculating molecular ground-state energies using a variational quantum eigensolver algorithm5. Having surpassed the 99{\%} barrier for the two-qubit gate fidelity, semiconductor qubits are well positioned on the path to fault tolerance and to possible applications in the era of noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.},

	abstract = {Quantum computation requires many qubits that can be coherently controlled and coupled to each other1. Qubits that are defined using lithographic techniques have been suggested to enable the development of scalable quantum systems because they can be implemented using semiconductor fabrication technology2--5. However, leading solid-state approaches function only at temperatures below 100 millikelvin, where cooling power is extremely limited, and this severely affects the prospects of practical quantum computation. Recent studies of electron spins in silicon have made progress towards a platform that can be operated at higher temperatures by demonstrating long spin lifetimes6, gate-based spin readout7 and coherent single-spin control8. However, a high-temperature two-qubit logic gate has not yet been demonstrated. Here we show that silicon quantum dots can have sufficient thermal robustness to enable the execution of a universal gate set at temperatures greater than one kelvin. We obtain single-qubit control via electron spin resonance and readout using Pauli spin blockade. In addition, we show individual coherent control of two qubits and measure single-qubit fidelities of up to 99.3 per cent. We demonstrate the tunability of the exchange interaction between the two spins from 0.5 to 18 megahertz and use it to execute coherent two-qubit controlled rotations. The demonstration of `hot'and universal quantum logic in a semiconductor platform paves the way for quantum integrated circuits that host both the quantum hardware and its control circuitry on the same chip, providing a scalable approach towards practical quantum information processing.},

Furthermore, we define the quantum dots in a two-by-two array and obtain controllable coupling along both directions. Qubit logic is implemented all-electrically and the exchange interaction can be pulsed to freely program one-qubit, two-qubit, three-qubit and four-qubit operations, resulting in a compact and highly connected circuit. We execute a quantum logic circuit that generates a four-qubit Greenberger−Horne−Zeilinger state and we obtain coherent evolution by incorporating dynamical decoupling. These results are a step towards quantum error correction and quantum simulation using quantum dots.},

The instances are also solvable by an industry-established genetic algorithm approach, which we use as a classical benchmark. We investigate several options to run the quantum computation optimally, ultimately discovering that the best results in terms of expected time-to-solution as a function of number of variables for the hardest instances set are obtained by seeding the quantum annealer with a solution candidate found by a greedy local search and then performing a reverse annealing protocol. The optimized reverse annealing protocol is found to be more than 100 times faster than the corresponding forward quantum annealing on average.},

We benchmarked our QBSM with three and four photons and analyzed sources of sampling inaccuracy. Scaling up to larger devices could offer the first definitive quantum-enhanced computation.},

	abstract = {Universal quantum computers1 promise a dramatic increase in speed over classical computers, but their full-size realization remains challenging2. However, intermediate quantum computational models3,4,5 have been proposed that are not universal but can solve problems that are believed to be classically hard. Aaronson and Arkhipov6 have shown that interference of single photons in random optical networks can solve the hard problem of sampling the bosonic output distribution. Remarkably, this computation does not require measurement-based interactions7,8 or adaptive feed-forward techniques9. Here, we demonstrate this model of computation using laser-written integrated quantum networks that were designed to implement unitary matrix transformations. We characterize the integrated devices using an in situ reconstruction method and observe three-photon interference10,11,12 that leads to the boson-sampling output distribution. Our results set a benchmark for a type of quantum computer with the potential to outperform a conventional computer through the use of only a few photons and linear-optical elements13.},

Our method significantly reduced the local field coefficient {\$}{\$}h{\$}{\$} and coupling term coefficient {\$}{\$}J{\$}{\$} by more than 33{\%} and 26{\%}, respectively, of those of Ising model, which can further improve the stability of qubit chains and improve the upper bound of integer factorization. In addition, our results obtained the best index (20-bit integer (1028171)) of quantum computing for deciphering RSA via the quantum computing software environment provided by D-Wave. Furthermore, Shor's algorithm requires approximately 40 qubits to factor the integer 1028171, which is far beyond the capacity of universal quantum computers. Thus, post quantum cryptography should further consider the potential of the D-Wave quantum computer for deciphering the RSA cryptosystem in future.},

Here, we report a programmable qudit-based quantum processor in silicon-photonic integrated circuits and demonstrate its enhancement of quantum computational parallelism. The processor monolithically integrates all the key functionalities and capabilities of initialisation, manipulation, and measurement of the two quantum quart (ququart) states and multi-value quantum-controlled logic gates with high-level fidelities. By reprogramming the configuration of the processor, we implemented the most basic quantum Fourier transform algorithms, all in quaternary, to benchmark the enhancement of quantum parallelism using qudits, which include generalised Deutsch-Jozsa and Bernstein-Vazirani algorithms, quaternary phase estimation and fast factorization algorithms. The monolithic integration and high programmability have allowed the implementations of more than one million high-fidelity preparations, operations and projections of qudit states in the processor. Our work shows an integrated photonic quantum technology for qudit-based quantum computing with enhanced capacity, accuracy, and efficiency, which could lead to the acceleration of building a large-scale quantum computer.},

The thesis would be strongly contradicted by physical devices that efficiently perform tasks believed to be intractable for classical computers. Such a task is boson sampling: sampling the output distributions of n bosons scattered by some passive, linear unitary process. We tested the central premise of boson sampling, experimentally verifying that three-photon scattering amplitudes are given by the permanents of submatrices generated from a unitary describing a six-mode integrated optical circuit. We find the protocol to be robust, working even with the unavoidable effects of photon loss, non-ideal sources, and imperfect detection. Scaling this to large numbers of photons should be a much simpler task than building a universal quantum computer.},

In the worst case, our quantum algorithms lead to polynomial reductions in query complexity relative to Monte Carlo algorithms.

	abstract = {Universal logic gates for two quantum bits (qubits) form an essential ingredient of quantum computation. Dynamical gates have been proposed1,2 in the context of trapped ions; however, geometric phase gates (which change only the phase of the physical qubits) offer potential practical advantages because they have higher intrinsic resistance to certain small errors and might enable faster gate implementation. Here we demonstrate a universal geometric π-phase gate between two beryllium ion-qubits, based on coherent displacements induced by an optical dipole force. The displacements depend on the internal atomic states; the motional state of the ions is unimportant provided that they remain in the regime in which the force can be considered constant over the extent of each ion's wave packet. By combining the gate with single-qubit rotations, we have prepared ions in an entangled Bell state with 97{\%} fidelity---about six times better than in a previous experiment3 demonstrating a universal gate between two ion-qubits. The particular properties of the gate make it attractive for a multiplexed trap architecture4,5 that would enable scaling to large numbers of ion-qubits.},

	abstract = {Scalable quantum computation1 and communication require error control to protect quantum information against unavoidable noise. Quantum error correction2,3 protects information stored in two-level quantum systems (qubits) by rectifying errors with operations conditioned on the measurement outcomes. Error-correction protocols have been implemented in nuclear magnetic resonance experiments4,5,6, but the inherent limitations of this technique7 prevent its application to quantum information processing. Here we experimentally demonstrate quantum error correction using three beryllium atomic-ion qubits confined to a linear, multi-zone trap. An encoded one-qubit state is protected against spin-flip errors by means of a three-qubit quantum error-correcting code. A primary ion qubit is prepared in an initial state, which is then encoded into an entangled state of three physical qubits (the primary and two ancilla qubits). Errors are induced simultaneously in all qubits at various rates. The encoded state is decoded back to the primary ion one-qubit state, making error information available on the ancilla ions, which are separated from the primary ion and measured. Finally, the primary qubit state is corrected on the basis of the ancillae measurement outcome. We verify error correction by comparing the corrected final state to the uncorrected state and to the initial state. In principle, the approach enables a quantum state to be maintained by means of repeated error correction, an important step towards scalable fault-tolerant quantum computation using trapped ions.},

	abstract = {{DrugBank (www.drugbank.ca) is a web-enabled database containing comprehensive molecular information about drugs, their mechanisms, their interactions and their targets. First described in 2006, DrugBank has continued to evolve over the past 12 years in response to marked improvements to web standards and changing needs for drug research and development. This year's update, DrugBank 5.0, represents the most significant upgrade to the database in more than 10 years. In many cases, existing data content has grown by 100\\% or more over the last update. For instance, the total number of investigational drugs in the database has grown by almost 300\\%, the number of drug-drug interactions has grown by nearly 600\\% and the number of SNP-associated drug effects has grown more than 3000\\%. Significant improvements have been made to the quantity, quality and consistency of drug indications, drug binding data as well as drug-drug and drug-food interactions. A great deal of brand new data have also been added to DrugBank 5.0. This includes information on the influence of hundreds of drugs on metabolite levels (pharmacometabolomics), gene expression levels (pharmacotranscriptomics) and protein expression levels (pharmacoprotoemics). New data have also been added on the status of hundreds of new drug clinical trials and existing drug repurposing trials. Many other important improvements in the content, interface and performance of the DrugBank website have been made and these should greatly enhance its ease of use, utility and potential applications in many areas of pharmacological research, pharmaceutical science and drug education.}},

We present an implementation of likelihood-based regularized unfolding on a quantum computer. The inverse problem is recast in terms of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), which has the same form of the Ising hamiltonian and hence it is solvable on a programmable quantum annealer. We tested the method using a model that captures the essence of the problem, and compared the results with a baseline method commonly used in precision measurements at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN. The unfolded distribution is in very good agreement with the original one. We also show how the method can be extended to include the effect of nuisance parameters representing sources of systematic uncertainties affecting the measurement.},

In particular, they provide estimates of the uncertainty associated with a prediction. Extending the Bayesian approach to deep architectures has remained a major challenge. Recent results connected deep feedforward neural networks with Gaussian processes, allowing training without backpropagation. This connection enables us to leverage a quantum algorithm designed for Gaussian processes and develop a new algorithm for Bayesian deep learning on quantum computers. The properties of the kernel matrix in the Gaussian process ensure the efficient execution of the core component of the protocol, quantum matrix inversion, providing at least a polynomial speedup over classical algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate the execution of the algorithm on contemporary quantum computers and analyze its robustness with respect to realistic noise models.},

	abstract = {Quantum algorithms have the potential to outperform their classical counterparts in a variety of tasks. The realization of the advantage often requires the ability to load classical data efficiently into quantum states. However, the best known methods require {\$}{\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathcal{\{}O{\}}{\}}{$\backslash$}left({\{}2{\}}\^{}{\{}n{\}}{$\backslash$}right){\$}{\$} gates to load an exact representation of a generic data structure into an {\$}{\$}n{\$}{\$}-qubit state. This scaling can easily predominate the complexity of a quantum algorithm and, thereby, impair potential quantum advantage. Our work presents a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for efficient, approximate quantum state loading. More precisely, we use quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (qGANs) to facilitate efficient learning and loading of generic probability distributions - implicitly given by data samples - into quantum states. Through the interplay of a quantum channel, such as a variational quantum circuit, and a classical neural network, the qGAN can learn a representation of the probability distribution underlying the data samples and load it into a quantum state. The loading requires {\$}{\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathcal{\{}O{\}}{\}}{$\backslash$}left(poly{$\backslash$}left(n{$\backslash$}right){$\backslash$}right){\$}{\$} gates and can thus enable the use of potentially advantageous quantum algorithms, such as Quantum Amplitude Estimation. We implement the qGAN distribution learning and loading method with Qiskit and test it using a quantum simulation as well as actual quantum processors provided by the IBM Q Experience. Furthermore, we employ quantum simulation to demonstrate the use of the trained quantum channel in a quantum finance application.},

	abstract = {We present a quantum algorithm that analyzes risk more efficiently than Monte Carlo simulations traditionally used on classical computers. We employ quantum amplitude estimation to price securities and evaluate risk measures such as Value at Risk and Conditional Value at Risk on a gate-based quantum computer. Additionally, we show how to implement this algorithm and how to trade-off the convergence rate of the algorithm and the circuit depth. The shortest possible circuit depth---growing polynomially in the number of qubits representing the uncertainty---leads to a convergence rate of O(M−2/3), where M is the number of samples. This is already faster than classical Monte Carlo simulations which converge at a rate of O(M−1/2). If we allow the circuit depth to grow faster, but still polynomially, the convergence rate quickly approaches the optimum of O(M−1). Thus, for slowly increasing circuit depths our algorithm provides a near quadratic speed-up compared to Monte Carlo methods. We demonstrate our algorithm using two toy models. In the first model we use real hardware, such as the IBM Q Experience, to price a Treasury-bill (T-bill) faced by a possible interest rate increase. In the second model, we simulate our algorithm to illustrate how a quantum computer can determine financial risk for a two-asset portfolio made up of government debt with different maturity dates. Both models confirm the improved convergence rate over Monte Carlo methods. Using simulations, we also evaluate the impact of cross-talk and energy relaxation errors.},

	abstract = {It is unknown whether near-term quantum computers are advantageous for machine learning tasks. In this work we address this question by trying to understand how powerful and trainable quantum machine learning models are in relation to popular classical neural networks. We propose the effective dimension---a measure that captures these qualities---and prove that it can be used to assess any statistical model's ability to generalize on new data. Crucially, the effective dimension is a data-dependent measure that depends on the Fisher information, which allows us to gauge the ability of a model to train. We demonstrate numerically that a class of quantum neural networks is able to achieve a considerably better effective dimension than comparable feedforward networks and train faster, suggesting an advantage for quantum machine learning, which we verify on real quantum hardware.},

	abstract = {Predicting the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its primary sequence of amino acids is known as the protein folding problem. Due to the central role of proteins'structures in chemistry, biology and medicine applications, this subject has been intensively studied for over half a century. Although classical algorithms provide practical solutions for the sampling of the conformation space of small proteins, they cannot tackle the intrinsic NP-hard complexity of the problem, even when reduced to the simplest Hydrophobic-Polar model. On the other hand, while fault-tolerant quantum computers are beyond reach for state-of-the-art quantum technologies, there is evidence that quantum algorithms can be successfully used in noisy state-of-the-art quantum computers to accelerate energy optimization in frustrated systems. In this work, we present a model Hamiltonian with {\$}{\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathcal{\{}O{\}}{\}}({\{}N{\}}\^{}{\{}4{\}}){\$}{\$}scaling and a corresponding quantum variational algorithm for the folding of a polymer chain with N monomers on a lattice. The model reflects many physico-chemical properties of the protein, reducing the gap between coarse-grained representations and mere lattice models. In addition, we use a robust and versatile optimization scheme, bringing together variational quantum algorithms specifically adapted to classical cost functions and evolutionary strategies to simulate the folding of the 10 amino acid Angiotensin on 22 qubits. The same method is also successfully applied to the study of the folding of a 7 amino acid neuropeptide using 9 qubits on an IBM 20-qubit quantum computer. Bringing together recent advances in building gate-based quantum computers with noise-tolerant hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, this work paves the way towards accessible and relevant scientific experiments on real quantum processors.},

Inagaki et al. and McMahon et al. show that an optical processing approach based on a network of coupled optical pulses in a ring fiber can be used to model and optimize large-scale Ising systems. Such a scalable architecture could help to optimize solutions to a wide range of complex problems.

Unconventional, special-purpose machines may aid in accelerating the solution of some of the hardest problems in computing, such as large-scale combinatorial optimizations, by exploiting different operating mechanisms than those of standard digital computers.

	abstract = { Benchmarking the coherent Ising machine and the D-Wave quantum annealer sheds light on the importance of connectivity. Physical annealing systems provide heuristic approaches to solving combinatorial optimization problems. Here, we benchmark two types of annealing machines---a quantum annealer built by D-Wave Systems and measurement-feedback coherent Ising machines (CIMs) based on optical parametric oscillators---on two problem classes, the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model and MAX-CUT. The D-Wave quantum annealer outperforms the CIMs on MAX-CUT on cubic graphs. On denser problems, however, we observe an exponential penalty for the quantum annealer [exp(--αDWN2)] relative to CIMs [exp(--αCIMN)] for fixed anneal times, both on the SK model and on 50\% edge density MAX-CUT. This leads to a several orders of magnitude time-to-solution difference for instances with over 50 vertices. An optimal--annealing time analysis is also consistent with a substantial projected performance difference. The difference in performance between the sparsely connected D-Wave machine and the fully-connected CIMs provides strong experimental support for efforts to increase the connectivity of quantum annealers. },

	abstract = {We review the national projects on quantum information science and technology in Japan over the past 30 years. The main funding agencies for this field have been the Japan Science and Technology Agency, the National Institute of Information and Communications Technology, the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, and the Cabinet Office of the Government of Japan. The total investment in the quantum information science and technology field from these funding agencies for the past 15 years amounts to US$250 million. A similar amount of investment has been put in parallel by industry. As a result, new science frontiers have been created, and some service prototypes, such as quantum key distribution systems and coherent Ising machines, have been delivered to user premises. Recently, Japan has launched new initiatives to advance quantum information science and technology to the next phase, and to make full use of them for the resolution of societal problems.},

	abstract = {Quantum algorithms have been developed for efficiently solving linear algebra tasks. However, they generally require deep circuits and hence universal fault-tolerant quantum computers. In this work, we propose variational algorithms for linear algebra tasks that are compatible with noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. We show that the solutions of linear systems of equations and matrix--vector multiplications can be translated as the ground states of the constructed Hamiltonians. Based on the variational quantum algorithms, we introduce Hamiltonian morphing together with an adaptive ans{\"a}tz for efficiently finding the ground state, and show the solution verification. Our algorithms are especially suitable for linear algebra problems with sparse matrices, and have wide applications in machine learning and optimisation problems. The algorithm for matrix multiplications can be also used for Hamiltonian simulation and open system simulation. We evaluate the cost and effectiveness of our algorithm through numerical simulations for solving linear systems of equations. We implement the algorithm on the IBM quantum cloud device with a high solution fidelity of 99.95%.},

	abstract = {Standard quantum computation is based on sequences of unitary quantum logic gates that process qubits. The one-way quantum computer proposed by Raussendorf and Briegel is entirely different. It has changed our understanding of the requirements for quantum computation and more generally how we think about quantum physics. This new model requires qubits to be initialized in a highly entangled cluster state. From this point, the quantum computation proceeds by a sequence of single-qubit measurements with classical feedforward of their outcomes. Because of the essential role of measurement, a one-way quantum computer is irreversible. In the one-way quantum computer, the order and choices of measurements determine the algorithm computed. We have experimentally realized four-qubit cluster states encoded into the polarization state of four photons. We characterize the quantum state fully by implementing experimental four-qubit quantum state tomography. Using this cluster state, we demonstrate the feasibility of one-way quantum computing through a universal set of one- and two-qubit operations. Finally, our implementation of Grover's search algorithm demonstrates that one-way quantum computation is ideally suited for such tasks.},

	abstract = {Quantum computers promise not only to outperform classical machines for certain important tasks, but also to preserve privacy of computation. For example, the blind quantum computing protocol enables secure delegated quantum computation, where a client can protect the privacy of their data and algorithms from a quantum server assigned to run the computation. However, this security comes with the practical limitation that the client and server must communicate after each step of computation. A practical alternative is homomorphic encryption, which does not require any interactions, while providing quantum-enhanced data security for a variety of computations. In this scenario, the server specifies the computation to be performed, and the client provides only the input data, thus enabling secure noninteractive computation. Here, we demonstrate homomorphic-encrypted quantum computing with unitary transformations of individual qubits, as well as multi-qubit quantum walk computations using single-photon states and non-birefringent integrated optics. The client encrypts their input in the photons'polarization state, while the server performs the computation using the path degree of freedom. Our demonstration using integrated quantum photonics underlines the applicability of homomorphic-encrypted quantum computations, and shows the potential for delegated quantum computing using photons.},

	abstract = {There is growing interest in states of matter with topological order. These are characterized by highly stable ground states robust to perturbations that preserve the topology, and which support excitations with so-called anyonic statistics. Topologically ordered states can arise in two-dimensional lattice-spin models, which were proposed as the basis for a new class of quantum computation. Here, we show that the relevant hamiltonians for such spin lattice models can be systematically engineered with polar molecules stored in optical lattices, where the spin is represented by a single-valence electron of a heteronuclear molecule. The combination of microwave excitation with dipole--dipole interactions and spin--rotation couplings enables building a complete toolbox for effective two-spin interactions with designable range, spatial anisotropy and coupling strengths significantly larger than relevant decoherence rates. Finally, we illustrate two models: one with an energy gap providing for error-resilient qubit encoding, and another leading to topologically protected quantum memory.},

	abstract = {A universal quantum simulator is a controlled quantum device that reproduces the dynamics of any other many-particle quantum system with short-range interactions. This dynamics can refer to both coherent Hamiltonian and dissipative open-system evolution. Here we propose that laser-excited Rydberg atoms in large-spacing optical or magnetic lattices provide an efficient implementation of a universal quantum simulator for spin models involving n-body interactions, including such of higher order. This would allow the simulation of Hamiltonians of exotic spin models involving n-particle constraints, such as the Kitaev toric code, colour code and lattice gauge theories with spin-liquid phases. In addition, our approach provides the ingredients for dissipative preparation of entangled states based on engineering n-particle reservoir couplings. The basic building blocks of our architecture are efficient and high-fidelity n-qubit entangling gates using auxiliary Rydberg atoms, including a possible dissipative time step through optical pumping. This enables mimicking the time evolution of the system by a sequence of fast, parallel and high-fidelity n-particle coherent and dissipative Rydberg gates.},

Such a photon is guaranteed to have the same polarization as the original photon. But is it possible by this or any other process to amplify a quantum state, that is, to produce several copies of a quantum system (the polarized photon in the present case) each having the same state as the original? If it were, the amplifying process could be used to ascertain the exact state of a quantum system: in the case of a photon, one could determine its polarization by first producing a beam of identically polarized copies and then measuring the Stokes parameters1. We show here that the linearity of quantum mechanics forbids such replication and that this conclusion holds for all quantum systems.},

While it has been successfully proven that such systems can in general be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems, they have not been used to solve chemistry applications. In this paper we apply a mapping, put forward by Xia et al. [25], from a quantum chemistry Hamiltonian to an Ising spin glass formulation and find the ground state energy with a quantum annealer. Additionally we investigate the scaling in terms of needed physical qubits on a quantum annealer with limited connectivity.

@article{Sarkar2021,
	abstract = {In this article, we present QuASeR, a reference-free DNA sequence reconstruction implementation via de novo assembly on both gate-based and quantum annealing platforms. This is the first time this important application in bioinformatics is modeled using quantum computation. Each one of the four steps of the implementation (TSP, QUBO, Hamiltonians and QAOA) is explained with a proof-of-concept example to target both the genomics research community and quantum application developers in a self-contained manner. The implementation and results on executing the algorithm from a set of DNA reads to a reconstructed sequence, on a gate-based quantum simulator, the D-Wave quantum annealing simulator and hardware are detailed. We also highlight the limitations of current classical simulation and available quantum hardware systems. The implementation is open-source and can be found on https://github.com/QE-Lab/QuASeR.},

@article{Tiunov2019,
	abstract = {The coherent Ising machine (CIM) enables efficient sampling of low-lying energy states of the Ising Hamiltonian with all-to-all connectivity by encoding the spins in the amplitudes of pulsed modes in an optical parametric oscillator (OPO). The interaction between the pulses is realized by means of measurement-based optoelectronic feedforward, which enhances the gain for lower-energy spin configurations. We present an efficient method of simulating the CIM on a classical computer that outperforms the CIM itself, as well as the noisy mean-field annealer in terms of both the quality of the samples and the computational speed. It is furthermore advantageous with respect to the CIM in that it can handle Ising Hamiltonians with arbitrary real-valued node coupling strengths. These results illuminate the nature of the faster performance exhibited by the CIM and may give rise to a new class of quantum-inspired algorithms of classical annealing that can successfully compete with existing methods.},

These results expand significantly on those in Newcomer (2008) and Newcomer et al. (2008), where the non-central moments were calculated up to order 4.},
