  "abstract": "It is well-known that the first energy shell, \\[\\mathcal{S}_1^{c_0}:=\\{α\\cos(x+μ)+β\\cos(y+λ): α^2+β^2=c_0\\,\\, \\&\\,\\, (μ,λ)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2\\}\\] of solutions to the 2d Euler equation is Lyapunov stable on $\\mathbb{T}^2$. This is simply a consequence of the conservation of energy and enstrophy. Using the idea of Wirosoetisno and Shepherd \\cite{WS}, which is to take advantage of conservation of a properly chosen Casimir, we give a simple and quantitative proof of the $L^2$ stability of single modes up to translation. In other words, each \\[\\mathcal{S}_1^{α,β}:=\\{α\\cos(x+μ)+β\\cos(y+λ): (μ,λ)\\in\\mathbb{R}^2\\}\\] is Lyapunov stable. Interestingly, our estimates indicate that the extremal cases $α=0,$ $β=0$, and $α=\\pmβ$ may be markedly less stable than the others.",
