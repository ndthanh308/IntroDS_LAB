  "abstract": "The soon-to-be-realized, global network of neutrino telescopes will allow new opportunities for collaboration between detectors. While each detector is distinct, they share the same underlying physical processes and detection principles. The full simulation chain for these telescopes is typically proprietary which limits the opportunity for joint studies. This means there is no consistent framework for simulating multiple detectors. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Prometheus, an open-source simulation tool for neutrino telescopes. Prometheus simulates neutrino injection and final state and photon propagation in both ice and water. It also supports user-supplied injection and detector specifications. In this contribution, we will introduce the software; show its runtime performance; and highlight successes in reproducing simulation results from multiple ice- and water-based observatories.",
