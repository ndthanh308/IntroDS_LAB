  "abstract": "We prove a Galois-type correspondence between compositions of purely inseparable field extensions (including infinite ones) and subalgebras of differential operators. This correspondence can be utilized to establish a connection between separable field extensions and purely inseparable field extensions. Specifically, it serves as a progression towards gaining a deeper comprehension of a foliation theory on varieties in positive characteristic.",
