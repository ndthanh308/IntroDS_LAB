\begin{abstract}
Hate speech moderation remains a challenging task for social media platforms. % Manual moderation is infeasible and machine learning models for detecting hate speech are unreliable as they often perform poorly on unseen data. 
Human-AI collaborative systems offer the potential to combine the strengths of humans' reliability and the scalability of machine learning to tackle this issue effectively.  % A key component in such systems is decision handover from machines to humans. 
%
%Existing methods for task handover in human-AI collaboration only consider the decision confidence of machines while failing to take into account the cost of incorrect predictions. 
While methods for task handover in human-AI collaboration exist that consider the costs of incorrect predictions, insufficient attention has been paid to accurately estimating these costs.
% have focused on finding appropriate heuristics for task handover from machines to humans, usually according to machine confidence, but they often do not fully take. 
% In this work, we introduce into the hate speech detection task a human-AI collaboration framework that automatically rejects machine decisions for human moderation based on value assessment of machine decisions from a user-centered perspective.
In this work, we propose a value-sensitive rejection mechanism that automatically rejects machine decisions for human moderation based on users' value perceptions regarding machine decisions. 
% value assessment of machine decisions from a user-centered perspective.
% The rejector is value-sensitive due to the incorporation of how humans feel towards correct, incorrect, and rejected predictions regarding instances of hate speech into the formulation of the optimal threshold, thus allowing us to take the implications of the made decision into account. 
% To measure , we obtained the required data through a rigorous crowdsourced study 
We conduct a crowdsourced survey study with 160 participants to evaluate their perception of correct and incorrect machine decisions in the domain of hate speech detection, as well as occurrences where the system rejects making a prediction. Here, we introduce Magnitude Estimation, an unbounded scale, as the preferred method for measuring user (dis)agreement with machine decisions.
% on  to  users to rate different outcomes of hate speech moderation scenarios using Magnitude Estimation, allowing us to quantify their level of (dis)agreement with the choice made and subsequently determine the optimal threshold. 
Our results show that Magnitude Estimation can provide a reliable measurement of participants' perception of machine decisions. By integrating user-perceived value into human-AI collaboration, we further show that it can guide us in \emph{1)} determining when to accept or reject machine decisions to obtain the optimal total value a model can deliver and \emph{2)} selecting better classification models as compared to the more widely used target of model accuracy. %Our proposed value-sensitive rejection mechanism therefore, paves a way for bridging the gap between the current practice of human-AI collaboration and the goal of optimizing for user-centered value. 
% These results Our work paves the way for measuring and integrating into human-AI collaboration that can deliver higher
