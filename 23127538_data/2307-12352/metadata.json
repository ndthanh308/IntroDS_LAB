  "abstract": "The use of low-rank approximation filters in the field of NMR is increasing due to their flexibility and effectiveness. Despite their ability to reduce the Mean Square Error between the processed signal and the true signal is well known, the statistical distribution of the residual noise is still undescribed. In this article, we show that low-rank approximation filters are equivalent to linear filters, and we calculate the mean and the covariance matrix of the processed data. We also show how to use this knowledge to build a maximum likelihood estimator, and we test the estimator's performance with a Montecarlo simulation of a 13C pyruvate metabolic tracer. While the article focuses on NMR spectroscopy experiment with hyperpolarized tracer, we also show that the results can be applied to tensorial data (e.g. using HOSVD) or 1D data (e.g. Cadzow filter).",
