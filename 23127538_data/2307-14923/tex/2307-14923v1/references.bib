	abstract = {We investigate the formation of protoplanetary disks around nine solar-mass stars formed in the context of a (40 pc)3 Giant Molecular Cloud model, using ramses adaptive mesh refinement simulations extending over a scale range of about 4 million, from an outer scale of 40 pc down to cell sizes of 2 au. Our most important result is that the accretion process is heterogeneous in multiple ways: in time, in space, and among protostars of otherwise similar mass. Accretion is heterogeneous in time, in the sense that accretion rates vary during the evolution, with generally decreasing profiles, whose slopes vary over a wide range, and where accretion can increase again if a protostar enters a region with increased density and low speed. Accretion is heterogeneous in space, because of the mass distribution, with mass approaching the accreting star–disk system in filaments and sheets. Finally, accretion is heterogeneous among stars, since the detailed conditions and dynamics in the neighborhood of each star can vary widely. We also investigate the sensitivity of disk formation to physical conditions and test their robustness by varying numerical parameters. We find that disk formation is robust even when choosing the least favorable sink particle parameters, and that turbulence cascading from larger scales is a decisive factor in disk formation. We also investigate the transport of angular momentum, finding that the net inward mechanical transport is compensated for mainly by an outward-directed magnetic transport, with a contribution from gravitational torques usually subordinate to the magnetic transport.}

	journal = {ApJ},
	abstract = {We investigate the role of mass infall in the formation and evolution of protostars. To avoid ad hoc initial and boundary conditions, we consider the infall resulting self-consistently from modeling the formation of stellar clusters in turbulent molecular clouds. We show that infall rates in turbulent clouds are comparable to accretion rates inferred from protostellar luminosities or measured in pre-main-sequence stars. They should not be neglected in modeling the luminosity of protostars and the evolution of disks, even after the embedded protostellar phase. We find large variations of infall rates from protostar to protostar, and large fluctuations during the evolution of individual protostars. In most cases, the infall rate is initially of order 10−5 M☉ yr−1, and may either decay rapidly in the formation of low-mass stars, or remain relatively large when more massive stars are formed. The simulation reproduces well the observed characteristic values and scatter of protostellar luminosities and matches the observed protostellar luminosity function. The luminosity problem is therefore solved once realistic protostellar infall histories are accounted for, with no need for extreme accretion episodes. These results are based on a simulation of randomly driven magnetohydrodynamic turbulence on a scale of 4 pc, including self-gravity, adaptive-mesh refinement to a resolution of 50 AU, and accreting sink particles. The simulation yields a low star formation rate, consistent with the observations, and a mass distribution of sink particles consistent with the observed stellar initial mass function during the whole duration of the simulation, forming nearly 1300 sink particles over 3.2Myr.}

Analysis and visualization with yt are oriented around physically relevant quantities rather than quantities native to astrophysical simulation codes. While originally designed for handling Enzo's structure adaptive mesh refinement data, yt has been extended to work with several different simulation methods and simulation codes including Orion, RAMSES, and FLASH. We report on its methods for reading, handling, and visualizing data, including projections, multivariate volume rendering, multi-dimensional histograms, halo finding, light cone generation, and topologically connected isocontour identification. Furthermore, we discuss the underlying algorithms yt uses for processing and visualizing data, and its mechanisms for parallelization of analysis tasks.},

	abstract = {Nearly half of all stars similar to our Sun are in binary or multiple systems1, which may affect the evolution of the stars and their protoplanetary disks during their earliest stages. NGC 1333-IRAS2A is a young, Class 0, low-mass protostellar system located in the Perseus molecular cloud2. It is known to drive two bipolar outflows that are~almost perpendicular to each other on the sky3,4 and is resolved into binary components, VLA1 and VLA2, through long wavelength continuum observations5. Here we report spatially and spectrally resolved observations of a range of molecular species. We compare these to detailed magnetohydrodynamic simulations: the~comparisons show that inhomogeneous accretion onto the circumstellar disks occurs in episodic bursts, driving a wobbling jet. We conclude that binarity and multiplicity in general strongly affect the properties of the emerging stars, as well as the physical and chemical structures of the protoplanetary disks and therefore potentially any emerging planetary systems.},

The first mechanism produces gaps in dust but not gas, while the second produces partial or total gas gaps which are deeper in the dust phase. Dust gaps do not necessarily indicate gas gaps.}",

title = {THE FORMATION OF LOW-MASS BINARY STAR SYSTEMS VIA TURBULENT FRAGMENTATION},
journal = {ApJ},
abstract = {We characterize the infall rate onto protostellar systems forming in self-gravitating radiation-hydrodynamics simulations. Using two dimensionless parameters to determine the disks' susceptibility to gravitational fragmentation, we infer limits on protostellar system multiplicity and the mechanism of binary formation. We show that these parameters give robust predictions even in the case of marginally resolved protostellar disks. We find that protostellar systems with radiation feedback predominately form binaries via turbulent fragmentation, not disk instability, and predict that turbulent fragmentation is the dominant channel for binary formation for low-mass stars. We clearly demonstrate that systems forming in simulations including radiative feedback have fundamentally different parameters than those in purely hydrodynamics simulations.}

We model the disc as a mixture of gas and dust, with grains ranging from 1 $\mu$m to 10 cm in size. Exploring different orbital inclinations, periastron distances, and mass ratios, we investigate the disc dynamical response during and after the flyby. We find that flybys induce evolving spiral structure in both gas and dust that can persist for thousands of years after periastron. Gas and dust structures induced by the flyby differ because of drag-induced effects on the dust grains. Variations in the accretion rate by up to an order of magnitude occur over a time-scale of the order of 10 yr or less, inducing FU Orionis-like outbursts. The remnant discs are truncated and warped. The dust disc is left more compact than the gas disc, both because of disc truncation and accelerated radial drift of grains induced by the flyby.},

We find that this correlation between bursts of accretion and passing periastron breaks down at later stages because of the gradual circularisation of the orbits. For eccentricities greater than {\textless}i{\textgreater}e{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 0.2, we observe episodic accretion triggered near periastron. However, we do not find any strong correlation between the strength of episodic accretion and eccentricity. The strength of accretion is defined as the ratio of the burst accretion rate to the quiescent accretion rate. We determine that accretion events are likely triggered by torques between the rotation of the circumstellar disc and the approaching binary stars. We compare our results with observational data of episodic accretion in short-period binaries and find good agreement between our simulations and the observations.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We conclude that episodic accretion is a universal mechanism operating in eccentric young binary-star systems, independent of separation, and it should be observable in long-period binaries as well as in short-period binaries. Nevertheless, the strength depends on the torques and hence the separation at periastron.},

	abstract = {We introduce a high-performance simulation framework that permits the semi-independent, task-based solution of sets of partial differential equations, typically manifesting as updates to a collection of `patches' in space-time. A hybrid MPI/OpenMP execution model is adopted, where work tasks are controlled by a rank-local `dispatcher' which selects, from a set of tasks generally much larger than the number of physical cores (or hardware threads), tasks that are ready for updating. The definition of a task can vary, for example, with some solving the equations of ideal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD), others non-ideal MHD, radiative transfer, or particle motion, and yet others applying particle-in-cell (PIC) methods. Tasks do not have to be grid based, while tasks that are, may use either Cartesian or orthogonal curvilinear meshes. Patches may be stationary or moving. Mesh refinement can be static or dynamic. A feature of decisive importance for the overall performance of the framework is that time-steps are determined and applied locally; this allows potentially large reductions in the total number of updates required in cases when the signal speed varies greatly across the computational domain, and therefore a corresponding reduction in computing time. Another feature is a load balancing algorithm that operates `locally' and aims to simultaneously minimize load and communication imbalance. The framework generally relies on already existing solvers, whose performance is augmented when run under the framework, due to more efficient cache usage, vectorization, local time-stepping, plus near-linear and, in principle, unlimited OpenMP and MPI scaling.},

The turbulent fragmentation model successfully predicts the main features of the observed stellar IMF assuming an isothermal equation of state without any stellar feedback. As a test of the model, we focus on the case of a magnetized isothermal gas, neglecting stellar feedback, while pursuing a large dynamic range in both space and timescales covering the full spectrum of stellar masses from brown dwarfs to massive stars. Our simulations represent a generic 4 pc region within a typical Galactic molecular cloud, with a mass of 3000 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and an rms velocity 10 times the isothermal sound speed and 5 times the average Alfv{\'e}n velocity, in agreement with observations. We achieve a maximum resolution of 50 au and a maximum duration of star formation of 4.0 Myr, forming up to a thousand sink particles whose mass distribution closely matches the observed stellar IMF. A large set of medium-size simulations is used to test the sink particle algorithm, while larger simulations are used to test the numerical convergence of the IMF and the dependence of the IMF turnover on physical parameters predicted by the turbulent fragmentation model. We find a clear trend toward numerical convergence and strong support for the model predictions, including the initial time evolution of the IMF. We conclude that the physics of isothermal MHD turbulence is sufficient to explain the origin of the IMF.},

The origin of these peaks has often been attributed to binary formation via core and disc fragmentation. However, theory and simulations suggest that young stellar systems that form via core fragmentation undergo significant orbital evolution.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We investigate the influence of the environment on the formation and orbital evolution of multiple star systems, and how core fragmentation contributes to the formation of close (20 - 100 AU) binaries. We use multiple simulations of star formation in giant molecular clouds and compare them to the multiplicity statistics of the Perseus star-forming region.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Simulations were run with the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES with sufficient resolution to resolve core fragmentation beyond 400 AU and dynamical evolution down to 16.6 AU, but without the possibility of resolving disc fragmentation. The evolution of the resulting stellar systems was followed over millions of years.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We find that star formation in lower gas density environments is more clustered; however, despite this, the fractions of systems that form via dynamical capture and core fragmentation are broadly consistent at \~{}40\% and \~{}60\%, respectively. In all gas density environments, we find that the typical scale at which systems form via core fragmentation is 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3 - 3.5{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} AU. After formation, we find that systems that form via core fragmentation have slightly lower inspiral rates (\~{}10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1.68{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} AU yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} measured over the first 10 000 yr) compared to dynamical capture (\~{}10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1.32{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} AU yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}). We then compared the simulation with the conditions most similar to the Perseus star-forming region to determine whether the observed bimodal distribution can be replicated. We find that it can be replicated, but it is sensitive to the evolutionary state of the simulation.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Our results indicate that a significant number of low-mass close binaries with separations from 20 - 100 AU can be produced via core fragmentation or dynamical capture due to efficient inspiral, without the need for a further contribution from disc fragmentation.},

	abstract = {We carry out radiation hydrodynamic calculations to study physical processes in the formation of a 1 M ? protostar. Following our previous work, calculations pursue the whole evolution from the beginning of the first collapse to the end of the main accretion phase. The adiabatic core formed after the initial collapse (i.e., the first core) experiences further gravitational collapse triggered by dissociation of molecular hydrogen, which leads to the formation of the second core, i.e., the birth of a protostar. The protostar grows in mass as accreting the infalling material from the circumstellar envelope, while the protostar keeps its radius at 4 R ? during the main accretion phase. These typical features in the evolution are in good agreement with previous studies. We consider two different initial conditions for the density distribution: homogeneous and hydrostatic cloud cores with the same central density of 1.415 {\texttimes} 10 -19 g cm -3 . The homogeneous core has the total mass of 1 M ? while the hydrostatic core has 3.852 M ? . For the initially homogeneous model, the accretion luminosity rapidly rises to the maximum value of 25 L ? just after the birth of a protostar, and declines gradually as the mass accretion rate decreases. In contrast, the luminosity increases monotonically with time for the initially hydrostatic model. This difference arises because the mass accretion rate varies depending on the inward acceleration at the initial stage, which affects the luminosity curve. A less massive hydrostatic core would possess the similar properties in the luminosity curve to the 3.852 M ? case, because a hydrostatic cloud core with mass lower than 3.852 M ? can be shown to provide a smaller mass accretion rate after the birth of a protostar and a more gradual rise in the luminosity curve. Our numerical code is designed to provide the evolution of the spectral energy distribution (SED) along with the dynamical evolution in our spherically symmetric calculations. We confirm that the SED evolves from a 10 K graybody spectrum to hotter spectra typical for class I and flat spectrum sources. The SED for the class 0 sources corresponds to the age of 2 {\texttimes} 10 4 yr, which is smaller by an order of magnitude than the typical age of class I objects. Considering possible nonspherically symmetric effects, we suggest that observed class 0 sources should consist of the "genuine" class 0 objects, which are as young as 10 4 yr, and more evolved protostars on edge-on view ("class 0-like class I" objects). The contamination of edge-on class I objects into class 0 sources are not negligible because they are more abundant than genuine class 0 objects. Since observations indicate that the class 0 sources are typically more luminous than class I sources, the initially hydrostatic model, where the luminosity increases monotonically with time, does not match the observations. The initially homogeneous model, in contrast, shows a tendency consistent with the observations. Compiling our results and other theoretical and observational evidence, we illustrate an evolutionary picture of protostar formation. In terms of the evolutionary time and the inclination to an observer, we find that protostellar objects are clearly categorized.},
