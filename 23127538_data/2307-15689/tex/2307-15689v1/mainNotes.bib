@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="In the sense that, for a uniform metric, one has $S_A \sim s|A|$ for an interval in a late-time state (geodesic directed along $\protect \hat  {x}$) and $S \sim sv_E \Delta t$ for a half-cut in a product state evolved for a short time $\Delta t$ (geodesic directed along $\protect \hat  {t}$)."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="The fact that $v_E=1$ in these circuits was previously exploited to simplify the extraction of critical exponents at the transition~\cite {zabalo_operator_2022}."}

@FOOTNOTE{Note4,key="Note4",note="As a practical matter in simulations, after performing a measurement on a site, we may entangle the qubit at that location with a reference $R$ instead of leaving it in the measured state."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note5,key="Note5",note="It is always possible that the location where $R$ is entangled gets measured again immediately afterwards, disentangling $R$ with some probability even inside the wedge."}
