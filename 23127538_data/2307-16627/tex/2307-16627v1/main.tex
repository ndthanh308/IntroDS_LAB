\begin{abstract}
The magnification effect of wormholes and black holes has been extensively researched. It is crucial to provide a finite distance analysis to understand this magnification phenomenon better. In this article, the rotational Simpson-Visser metric (RSV) is chosen as the focus of research. By calculating the deflection of light in RSV metric, we determine the resulting magnification effect, then applied the RSV metric to specific examples such as the Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole, Schwarzschild black hole, and Kerr black hole (or wormhole) to analyze the magnification. We find that Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole only has single magnification peaks, while Kerr black hole has one to three magnification peaks. In addition, the article's findings suggest that the lensing effect of the Central Black Hole of the Milky Way Galaxy exhibits magnification of multiple peaks. However, it should be noted that these effects are not observable from Earth.

\section{Introduction}
\label{intro}
The recent development of gravitational wave astronomy has brought a shift in the discussion surrounding black hole mimickers from theory to empirical observations \cite{Mazza:2021rgq,Annulli:2021ccn,Liu:2021aqh,Bao:2018msr,Abdulxamidov:2022ofi,Heckman:2021vzx,Aneesh:2018hlp,Wang:2018mlp,Simpson:2019cer}. With the absence of a definitive quantum gravity theory \cite{Clifton:2011jh,Capozziello:2011et}, there is an opportunity to explore alternative phenomenologically viable scenarios using simple meta-geometries. This approach offers a compact and accessible means of investigating such possibilities.  Simpson and Visser \cite{Mazza:2021rgq,Simpson:2019cer,Lobo:2020ffi} have put forward a static and spherically symmetric metric known as the SV metric, which provides a comprehensive and nuanced model for black holes and wormholes. This metric smoothly transitions between different cases and is described by the line element:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    ds^2&=-\left(1-\frac{2M}{\sqrt{r^2+l^2}}\right)dt^2+\left(1-\frac{2M}{\sqrt{r^2+l^2}}\right)^{-1}dr^2\\
   &+\left(r^2+l^2\right)\left(d\theta^2+\sin^2\theta d\phi^2\right),
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $M\geqslant 0$ represents the ADM mass and $l \geqslant 0$ is a parameter responsible for regularizing the central singularity. By employing the Newman–Janis procedure \cite{Newman:1965tw}, the rotating SV metric (RSV) can be obtained:
\begin{equation}
\label{RSV}
\begin{split}
    ds^2&=-\left(1-\frac{2M\sqrt{r^2+l^2}}{\Sigma}\right)dt^2+\frac{\Sigma}{\Delta}dr^2\\
   &+\Sigma d\theta^2-\frac{4Ma\sin^2\theta\sqrt{r^2+l^2}}{\Sigma}dtd\phi+\frac{\chi\sin^2\theta}{\Sigma}d\phi^2,
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\Sigma=r^2+l^2+a^2\cos^2(\theta)$, $\Delta=r^2+l^2+a^2-2M\sqrt{r^2+l^2}$, and $\chi=(r^2+l^2+a^2)^2-\Delta a^2\sin^2\theta$. Here, $a$ represents the ratio of spin angular momentum $J$ to mass $M$, $a=\frac{J}{M}$. The RSV metric \eqref{RSV} reduces to the SV metric when $a=0$ and to the Kerr metric when $l=0$. The values of $\frac{l}{M}$ and $\frac{a}{M}$ determine the conversion between black holes and wormholes in the RSV metric, as shown in FIG. \ref{fig: 1}. These distinctive features of RSV make it a convenient tool for studying the differences between black holes and wormholes.

Gravitational lensing is a powerful technology for exploring the universe \cite{Huang:2023bto,Kelly:2023mgv,Li:2023zrz,Awad:2023tvu}. The presence of a lens can alter the space-time and impact the observed physical quantities such as magnification \cite{Kelly:2023wzm,Awad:2023tvu,Gao:2022cds,Sun:2022ujt}, event rate \cite{Kelly:2023mgv,Cai:2022kbp,Gao:2023sla} and shadow \cite{Meng:2023wgi,Ramadhan:2023ogm,Xavier:2023exm}. By studying these observable measurements, we can explore the lens itself. Before our work, physicists have extensively studied the lensing effect of black holes \cite{Delos:2023fpm,Lu:2022yuc,Sun:2022ujt,Verma:2022pym,Gao:2022cds,Rose:2022xdu} and wormholes \cite{Cheng:2021hoc,Tsukamoto:2017hva,Sajadi:2016hko,Tsukamoto:2016zdu,Safonova:2001vz,Torres:1998xd}. Their research provides valuable insights that inspire us to search the possibility of distinguishing wormholes and black holes based on magnification: wormholes and black holes may exhibit different magnification patterns.


In this article, we select RSV space as the research object because it can smoothly transform between wormholes and black holes. We calculate the deflection angle of light in the RSV metric and study the resulting magnification effect. We specifically discussed the magnification effect of Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole, Schwarzschild black hole,  and Kerr black hole. We used dimensionless units to analyze the variation of magnification with lens geometry, wormhole throat radius, ADM mass, and spin. At the end of the article, we restored physical units to analyze the magnification of the Central Black Hole of the Milky Way Galaxy.

The structure of this article is as follows: the first section \ref{intro} provides an introduction about background space and gravitational lensing, section \ref{spacetime} describes some geometric quantities in axisymmetric rotational spacetime, Section \ref{deflection angle} calculates the deflection angle of RSV metric, Section \ref{magnification} analyzes the magnification effect of RSV associating spacetime, and Section \ref{conclusions} concludes and provides future prospects.


\section{Spacetime}
\label{spacetime}
In this section, we examine various geometric quantities associated with the metric \eqref{RSV}. The terminology used follows from \cite{Ono:2017pie,Ono:2018jrv,Ishihara:2016sfv,Ishihara:2016vdc}.
For convenience, we rewrite the metric \eqref{RSV} as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq 3}
ds^2=-Adt^2+Bdr^2+Cd\theta^2-2Hdtd\phi+Dd\phi^2,
\end{equation}
where $A=g_{tt}$, $B=g_{rr}$, and so on.
We primarily focus on studying the motion of photons in the metric \eqref{eq 3}. The length along the light path, $ds^2=0$, is given by:
\begin{equation}
d\ell^2\equiv \gamma_{ij}dx^idx^j=\frac{B}{A}dr^2+ \frac{C}{A}d\theta^2+\frac{AD+H^2}{A^2}d\phi^2.
\end{equation}
Here, $\gamma_{ij}$ defines a 3-dimensional Riemann space where the photon's motion is described as a trajectory in a spatial curve $\ell$.
The closest distance between a photon and the central celestial body in the lens plane is known as the impact parameter $b$ (the definition comes from straight-line approximation), which can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
b\equiv \frac{L}{E}=\frac{-H+D\frac{d\phi}{dt}}{A+H\frac{d\phi}{dt}}.
\end{equation}
This expression is general for axisymmetric spacetime.
$L$ represents the angular momentum of the photon and $E$ represents its energy.
In terms of the impact parameter, the orbital equation of the photon can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\left(\frac{dr}{d\phi}\right)^2=\frac{AD+H^2}{B}\frac{D-2Hb-Ab^2}{(H+Ab)^2}.
\label{eq 6}
\end{equation}
This equation can be solved to obtain $r=F(\phi)$ using perturbational methods (see the appendix of \cite{Gao:2023ltr}). This is an important detail for calculating the deflection angle using the Gaussian Bonnet theory. At a zero-order approximation, we can obtain $r=\frac{b}{\sin\phi}$.
In metric \eqref{eq 3}, the geodesic curvature can be defined as:
\begin{equation}
\kappa=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma\gamma^{\theta\theta}}}\partial_r\left(\frac{H}{A}\right),
\end{equation}
and the Gauss curvature as:
\begin{small}
\begin{equation}
K=-\sqrt{\frac{A^3}{B(AD+H^2)}}\partial_r\left[\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{\frac{A^3}{B(AD+H^2)}}\partial_r\left(\frac{AD+H^2}{A^2}\right)\right].
\end{equation}
\end{small}
With these preparations, we can now investigate the microlensing effect of the RSV metric.

\section{deflection angle}
\label{deflection angle}
We consider that both the source and the observer are far away from the lens.
The deflection angle $\alpha$ is defined as the difference between the ray directions at the
source $\ell=-\infty$ and the observer $\ell=\infty$ in the asymptotically flat regions \cite{Asada:2003nf}.
\begin{equation}
\alpha_{\text{infinity}}=e_S-e_O=-\int_{-\infty}^\infty d\ell \frac{de}{d\ell}.
\end{equation}
 We adopt GW method \cite{Gibbons:2008rj, Werner:2012rc} to calculate the deflection angle by Gauss Bonnet's theorem, 
\begin{equation}
\int\int_D KdS+\int_{\partial D}\kappa d\ell+\sum\limits_i\alpha_i=2\pi\chi(D).
\end{equation}
One can choose the integral domain $D$ in Fig. \ref{fig:1}, $SO$ is the path of light,  Besides, this Euler index $\chi$ in domain $D$ is one. Then,
\begin{equation}
\int\int_{D}KdS+\int_{\gamma}\kappa d\ell+\int_{OS}\kappa d\ell+\sum_i\alpha_i=2\pi.
\end{equation}
We can set $\gamma$ to vertically intersect extension line of $SO$ at infinity, which means
\begin{equation}
\sum_i\alpha_i=\frac{\pi}{2}(\infty)+\frac{\pi}{2}(\infty)=\pi.
\end{equation}
Then we do an integral transformation
\begin{equation}
\kappa d\ell=\kappa\frac{d\ell}{d\phi}d\phi.
\end{equation}
Here $\phi$ is the angular coordinate of the center at $L$. Since we only fixed the endpoint of $\gamma$, we can directly set up $\kappa\frac{dt}{d\phi}=1$ on $\gamma$, so there is
\begin{equation}
\int\int_{D}KdS+\int_{0}^{\pi+\alpha}d\phi+\int_{OS}\kappa d\ell+\pi=2\pi.
\end{equation}
 $SO$ is a straight line (without a lens), that is, the angle that $SO$ spans is $\pi+\alpha$, and we select the angular coordinate of point O to be 0. We assume that both the observer and the light source are far away from the central object for the upper limit of integration $r=\infty$. Then
\begin{equation}
\label{eq 14}
\alpha=-\int_{\phi_O}^{\phi_S}\int_r^\infty KdS+\int_{\phi_O}^{\phi_S}\kappa\psi d\phi,
\end{equation}
where used $d\ell=\psi d\phi$. 
In the case of metric \eqref{RSV}, We present the results of each part of the calculation:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq.r}
\frac{1}{r}=\frac{\sin\phi}{b}+\frac{M}{b^2}(1+\cos^2\phi)+\mathcal{O}(M^2,a^2,l^2,Ma),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
K=-\frac{2M}{r^3}+\frac{3M^2}{r^4}-\frac{l^2}{r^4}+\mathcal{O}(l^3,a^3,M^3,...),
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
dS=\left(r+\frac{l^2}{2r}+3M+\frac{15M^2}{2r}+\mathcal{O}(l^3,a^3,M^3,...)\right)drd\phi,
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\kappa=\pm\frac{2aM}{r^3}+\mathcal{O}(l^3,a^3,M^3,...),
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\psi= b\csc^2(\phi)+\mathcal{O}(l,M,a).
\end{equation}
Finally, the infinite distance deflection angle of the second order is equal to
\begin{equation}
\label{eq.15}
\alpha_{\text{infinite}}^\text{RSV}=\frac{4M}{b}+\frac{\pi  \left(l^2+15 M^2\right)}{4 b^2}\pm\frac{4aM}{b^2},
\end{equation}
where $\pm$ comes from spin direction.
 For the deflection angle $\alpha$, when $M$ is 0, it is returned to the deflection angle of the Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole \cite{Dey:2008kn} where $l$ is wormhole throat. When $l^2$ equals 0, it is returned to the Kerr black hole case \cite{Werner:2012rc}. Referring to Fig. \ref{fig:1} and \ref{fig:2}, we obtain a finite distance deflection angle $\alpha_{\text{finite}}$:
 \begin{equation}
\bigg[\frac{l^2+15M^2}{4b^2}\phi-\frac{2M}{b}\cos\phi\pm \frac{2aM}{b^2} \cos\phi \bigg]_{\phi=\phi_O}^{\phi=\phi_S}
 \end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
\label{eq 23}
\phi\big|_{\phi_O}^{\phi_S}=\pi-\arcsin\frac{b}{D_{LS}}-\arcsin\frac{b}{D_L}
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
\label{eq 24}
\cos\phi \big|_{\phi_O}^{\phi_S}=-\big(\sqrt{1-b^2/D_{LS}^2}+\sqrt{1-b^2/D_L^2} \big).
\end{equation}
These geometric relationships can also be solved by solving Eq \eqref{eq 6}, and then the angular coordinates $\phi_S$ and $\phi_O$ corresponding to the distances $D_{LS}$ and $D_L$ respectively. Furthermore, in Eq \eqref{eq 23} and Eq \eqref{eq 24} we overlooked the term of $\mathcal{O}(M)$. For more details, see \cite{Ono:2017pie}.


\section{magnification}
\label{magnification}

Magnification reflects the degree to which light is distorted, which is an observable quantity. We will study the lensing effect from this perspective.
Referring to Fig. \ref{fig:2}, One can obtain the geometric relationship as
\begin{equation}
\label{eq.16}
\beta=\theta-\frac{D_{LS}}{D_S}\alpha.
\end{equation}
The lens potential $\Psi$ which can connect deflection angle and magnification is defined as
$
\Psi=\frac{2D_{LS}}{D_LD_S}\int\Phi(\theta D_L,x)dx,
$
where $\Phi$ is Newtonian potential. The relationship between lens potential energy and deflection angle is as follows
\begin{equation}
\partial_\theta\Psi=D_L\partial_b\frac{2D_{LS}}{D_LD_S}\int\Phi(b,x)dx=\alpha.
\end{equation}
On the other hand, the Jacobian metric is also related to the lens potential
\begin{equation}
A_{ij}\equiv\left(\delta_{ij}-\frac{\partial^2\Psi}{\partial\theta_i\partial\theta_j}\right).
\end{equation}
The magnification is defined as the inverse of the Jacobian determinant and can in axisymmetric spaces be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq.20}
\mu\equiv\frac{1}{\det A_{ij}}=\bigg|\frac{\beta}{\theta}\frac{d\beta}{d\theta}\bigg|^{-1}.
\end{equation}
Based on Eq \eqref{eq.20}, \eqref{eq.15}, and \eqref{eq.16}, we could work out the  magnification $\mu$ of metric \eqref{RSV} associating spacetime:

\begin{equation}
\mu_{\text{finite}}=\bigg|\frac{D_L^2}{b}\beta \frac{\partial}{\partial b}\bigg(\frac{b}{D_L}-\frac{D_{LS}}{D_S}\alpha_{\text{finite}} \bigg) \bigg|^{-1}.
\end{equation}
We do not intend to discuss the issue of magnification peak, where $\frac{d\mu}{db}=0 $ and $ \frac{d^2\mu}{db^2}<0$, from the analytical expression of magnification. Directly drawing numerical graphs with limited distance magnification is more intuitive.

We first consider the influence of lens geometry on magnification. (Due to the dimensionless nature of magnification, we adopt a dimensionless specification.)
The numerical results presented in Fig. \ref{fig:4} demonstrate that the distance between the source and lens has minimal influence on magnification, while the distance between the observer and lens has a noteworthy impact. For the interval $D_L\in [55,100]$, the magnification decreases to one.  When the observer is situated far from the lens $D_L\in [100,\infty)$ the magnification is reduced to zero. In light of these findings, we will continue our discussion using a fixed parameter of $D_L=D_{LS}=10$ in subsequent cases. 



If the ADM mass is set to zero, the RSV metric will transform into an Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole. In this scenario, where $l$ represents the throat radius of the wormhole, the magnification is depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:5}. From the figure, we can observe that the Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole exhibits a single magnification peak. (How to determine the number of peaks? We use a straight line parallel to the b-axis to capture the black bars in the graph, and the number of cutoff points is the number of magnification peaks.)

When both $l$ and $a$ are set to zero, the RSV metric reverts to a Schwarzschild black hole. In Fig. \ref{fig:6}, it can be observed that there are three magnification peaks within the interval $M\in[0.05,0.1] $. As we decrease the mass to the range of $M\in[0.05,0.01]$, the three peaks coalesce into two. Finally, when the mass is less than $0.01$, only one magnification peak remains.

In the case of a rotating black hole or possibly a wormhole.
$l$ corresponds to exotic matter ($T_{00}<0$), and $M$ represents conventional matter. Btween $M$ and $l$ may has an interaction term $T_{\text{inter}}$ that corresponds to a geometric quantity $G_{\text{inter}}$. To ensure safety, we set $l$ to zero.
it is significant to consider the direction of the black hole's spin determined by parameter $a$. We use the positive and negative cases of a to represent different spin directions, as discussed in Fig. \ref{fig:7} and Fig. \ref{fig:8}, respectively.  
Let us first examine the scenario where the spin is positive, as depicted in Fig. \ref{fig:7}. In the interval of $a\in[0.00,0.05]$, two magnification peaks can be observed. However, for $a\in[0.05,0.30]$, only one magnification peak is present. Next, we consider the case of negative spin, as illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:8}. Within the interval of $a\in[0.00,0.18]$, three magnification peaks exist. In the interval of $a\in[0.18,0.22]$, there are two magnification peaks. Finally, for $a\in[0.22,0.30]$, only one magnification peak is observed.

\section{Conclusions and outlook}
\label{conclusions}

In this paper, we study the gravitational lensing effect of the RSV metric. 
We obtained the second-order deflection angle of the RSV metric and made finite distance corrections to it. Our analysis of magnification shows that the distance between the lens and the observer has a significant impact on the numerical value of magnification, which also indicates that finite distance correction is meaningful. On this basis, Ellis-Bronnikov Wormhole only exhibits a single peak of magnification, while Schwarzschild's black hole exhibits up to three magnification peaks as the ADM mass increases. Black holes with negative spin return from three peaks to a single peak as the spin increases, and Black holes with positive spin return from two peaks to a single peak as the spin increases.

For the galaxy we live in, the mass of its central black hole is about four million Solar mass $\rm M_\odot$. If we assume that its spin is small (Spin slightly affect the position of the peak) and be approximated as the Schwarzschild black hole situation, according to our calculations $\frac{\text{four million}~\rm M_\odot}{0.08}=\frac{DL}{10}$, we will be able to observe the phenomenon of three magnification peaks, see Fig. \ref{fig:9}, at distance $D_L=7.4\times 10^{8}~\rm km$ (The Schwarzschild radius is approximately $7.8\times 10^6~\rm km$). The distance from Earth to the center of the Milky Way galaxy is about $2.4\times 10^{16}~\rm km$, and the magnification effect observed at this distance is equivalent to a small mass situation in Fig. \ref{fig:6}, which will converge to a single peak situation. (Not even observable, according to Fig. \ref{fig:4}.).

Finally, it is theoretically feasible to distinguish between wormholes and black holes based on magnification, But it is unfeasible at far distances.
