  "abstract": "The magnification effect of wormholes and black holes has been extensively researched. It is crucial to provide a finite distance analysis to understand this magnification phenomenon better. In this article, the rotational Simpson-Visser metric (RSV) is chosen as the focus of research. By calculating the deflection of light in RSV metric, we determine the resulting magnification effect, then applied the RSV metric to specific examples such as the Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole, Schwarzschild black hole, and Kerr black hole (or wormhole) to analyze the magnification. We find that Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole only has single magnification peaks, while Kerr black hole has one to three magnification peaks. In addition, the article's findings suggest that the lensing effect of the Central Black Hole of the Milky Way Galaxy exhibits magnification of multiple peaks. However, it should be noted that these effects are not observable from Earth.",
