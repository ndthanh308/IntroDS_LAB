  "abstract": "We study the representation theory of the subregular W-algebra $\\mathcal{W}^k(\\mathfrak{so}_{2n+1},f_{sub})$ of type B and the principal W-superalgebra $\\mathcal{W}^\\ell(\\mathfrak{osp}_{2|2n})$, which are related by an orthosymplectic analogue of Feigin-Semikhatov duality in type A. We establish a block-wise equivalence of weight modules over the W-superalgebras by using the relative semi-infinite cohomology functor and spectral flow twists, which generalizes the result of Feigin-Semikhatov-Tipunin for the N=2 superconformal algebra. In particular, the correspondence of Wakimoto type free field representations is obtained. When the level of the subregular W-algebra is exceptional, we classify the simple modules over the simple quotients $\\mathcal{W}_k(\\mathfrak{so}_{2n+1},f_{sub})$ and $\\mathcal{W}_\\ell(\\mathfrak{osp}_{2|2n})$ and derive the character formulae.",
