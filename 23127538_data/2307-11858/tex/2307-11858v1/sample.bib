abstract={Phonon lasers, which exploit coherent amplifications of phonons, are a means to explore nonlinear phononics, image nanomaterial structures and operate phononic devices. Recently, a phonon laser governed by dispersive optomechanical coupling has been demonstrated by levitating a nanosphere in an optical tweezer. Such levitated optomechanical devices, with minimal noise in high vacuum, can allow flexible control of large-mass objects without any internal discrete energy levels. However, it is challenging to achieve phonon lasing with levitated microscale objects because optical scattering losses are much larger than at the nanoscale. Here we report a nonlinear multi-frequency phonon laser with a micro-size sphere, which is governed by dissipative coupling. The active gain provided by a Yb3+-doped system plays a key role. It achieves three orders of magnitude for the amplitude of the fundamental-mode phonon lasing, compared with the passive device. In addition, nonlinear mechanical harmonics can emerge spontaneously above the lasing threshold. Furthermore, we observe coherent correlations of phonons for both the fundamental mode and its harmonics. Our work drives the field of levitated optomechanics into a regime where it becomes feasible to engineer collective motional properties of typical micro-size objects.},

abstract={Cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) manipulates the coupling of light with matter, and allows several emitters to couple coherently with one light mode1. However, even in a many-body system, the light--matter coupling mechanism has so far been restricted to one-body processes. Leveraging cavity QED for the quantum simulation of complex, many-body systems has thus far relied on multi-photon processes, scaling down the light--matter interaction to the low energy and slow time scales of the many-body problem2--5. Here we report cavity QED experiments using molecular transitions in a strongly interacting Fermi gas, directly coupling cavity photons to pairs of atoms. The interplay of strong light--matter and strong interparticle interactions leads to well-resolved pair polaritons---hybrid excitations coherently mixing photons, atom pairs and molecules. The dependence of the pair-polariton spectrum on interatomic interactions is universal, independent of the transition used, demonstrating a direct mapping between pair correlations in the ground state and the optical spectrum. This represents a magnification of many-body effects by two orders of magnitude in energy. In the dispersive regime, it enables fast, minimally destructive measurements of pair correlations, and opens the way to their measurement at the quantum limit and their coherent manipulation using dynamical, quantized optical fields.},

We report on a cavity optomechanical system in which a collective density excitation of a Bose-Einstein condensate serves as the mechanical oscillator coupled to the cavity field. A few photons inside the ultrahigh-finesse cavity trigger strongly driven back-action dynamics, in quantitative agreement with a cavity optomechanical model. We approach the strong coupling regime of cavity optomechanics, where a single excitation of the mechanical oscillator substantially influences the cavity field. The results open up new directions for investigating mechanical oscillators in the quantum regime and the border between classical and quantum physics.}}

title = {Single and two-mode mechanical squeezing of an optically levitated nanodiamond via dressed-state coherence},
journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {Nonclassical states of macroscopic objects are promising for ultrasensitive metrology as well as testing quantum mechanics. In this work, we investigate dissipative mechanical quantum state engineering in an optically levitated nanodiamond. First, we study single-mode mechanical squeezed states by magnetically coupling the mechanical motion to a dressed three-level system provided by a nitrogen-vacancy center in the nanoparticle. Quantum coherence between the dressed levels is created via microwave fields to induce a two-phonon transition, which results in mechanical squeezing. Remarkably, we find that in ultrahigh vacuum quantum squeezing is achievable at room temperature with feedback cooling. For moderate vacuum, quantum squeezing is possible with cryogenic temperature. Second, we present a setup for two mechanical modes coupled to the dressed three levels, which results in two-mode squeezing analogous to the mechanism of the single-mode case. In contrast to previous works, our study provides a deterministic method for engineering macroscopic squeezed states without the requirement for a cavity.}

It has been predicted theoretically that for distances smaller than the peak wavelength of the blackbody spectrum, radiative heat transfer can be increased by the contribution of evanescent waves1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. This contribution can be viewed as energy tunnelling through the gap between the surfaces. Although these effects have already been observed9,10,11,12,13,14, a detailed quantitative comparison between theory and experiments in the nanometre regime is still lacking. Here, we report an experimental setup that allows measurement of conductance for gaps varying between 30 nm and 2.5 {\textmu}m.

Magnetic properties of low-loss dielectric nanoparticles in the visible or infrared are not expected due to intrinsic low refractive index of optical media in these regimes. Here we analyze the dipolar electric and magnetic response of lossless dielectric spheres made of moderate permittivity materials. For low material refractive index (â‰² 3) there are no sharp resonances due to strong overlapping between different multipole contributions. However, we find that Silicon particles with index of refraction $\sim$ 3.5 and radius $\sim$ 200nm present strong electric and magnetic dipolar resonances in telecom and near-infrared frequencies, (i.e. at wavelengths $\approx$ 1.2 -- 2$\mu$m) without spectral overlap with quadrupolar and higher order resonances. The light scattered by these Si particles can then be perfectly described by dipolar electric and magnetic fields.},

This permits us to establish conclusions for any sign of this medium refractive index. Expressions for the gradient force, radiation pressure and curl components are obtained for the force due to both the electric and magnetic dipoles excited in the particle. In particular, for the magnetic force we tentatively introduce the concept of curl of the spin angular momentum density of the magnetic field, also expressed in terms of 3D generalizations of the Stokes parameters. From the formal analogy between the conservation of momentum and the optical theorem, we discuss the origin and significance of the electric-magnetic dipolar interaction force; this is done in connection with that of the angular distribution of scattered light and of the extinction cross section.},

The scheme is based on magnetically levitating the sphere above a superconducting chip and letting it skate through a static magnetic potential landscape where it interacts for short intervals with quantum circuits. In this way, a protocol for fast quantum interferometry using quantum magnetomechanics is passively implemented. Such a table-top earth-based quantum experiment would operate in a parameter regime where gravitational energy scales become relevant.

Therefore, they can provide a first experimental view on gravity in the quantum regime. We will survey models of decoherence induced both by classical and quantum gravitational fluctuations; it will be manifest that a clear understanding of gravitational decoherence is still lacking. Next we will review models where quantum theory is modified, under the assumption that gravity causes the collapse of the wave functions, when systems are large enough. These models challenge the quantum-gravity interplay, and can be tested experimentally. In the last part we have a look at the state of the art of experimental research.

abstract={Roger Penrose proposed that a spatial quantum superposition collapses as a back-reaction from spacetime, which is curved in different ways by each branch of the superposition. In this sense, one speaks of gravity-related wave function collapse. He also provided a heuristic formula to compute the decay time of the superposition---similar to that suggested earlier by Lajos Di{\'o}si, hence the name Di{\'o}si--Penrose model. The collapse depends on the effective size of the mass density of particles in the superposition, and is random: this randomness shows up as a diffusion of the particles' motion, resulting, if charged, in the emission of radiation. Here, we compute the radiation emission rate, which is faint but detectable. We then report the results of a dedicated experiment at the Gran Sasso underground laboratory to measure this radiation emission rate. Our result sets a lower bound on the effective size of the mass density of nuclei, which is about three orders of magnitude larger than previous bounds. This rules out the natural parameter-free version of the Di{\'o}si--Penrose model.},

abstract={The stability of a quantum superposition of two different stationary mass distributions is examined, where the perturbing effect of each distribution on the space-time structure is taken into account, in accordance with the principles of general relativity. It is argued that the definition of the time-translation operator for the superposed space-times involves an inherent ill-definedness, leading to an essential uncertainty in the energy of the superposed state which, in the Newtonian limit, is proportional to the gravitational self-energyE$\Delta$ of the difference between the two mass distributions. This is consistent with a suggested finite lifetime of the order of ħ/E$\Delta$ for the superposed state, in agreement with a certain proposal made by the author for a gravitationally induced spontaneous quantum state reduction, and with closely related earlier suggestions by Di{\'o}si and by Ghirardiet al.},

Whereas standard quantum theory places no limit on particle size, alternative, yet untested theories---conceived to explain the apparent quantum to classical transition---forbid macroscopic superpositions. Here we propose an interferometer with a levitated, optically cooled and then free-falling silicon nanoparticle in the mass range of one million atomic mass units, delocalized over >150{\thinspace}nm. The scheme employs the near-field Talbot effect with a single standing-wave laser pulse as a phase grating. Our analysis, which accounts for all relevant sources of decoherence, indicates that this is a viable route towards macroscopic high-mass superpositions using available technology.},

abstract={Matter-wave interference experiments provide a direct confirmation of the quantum superposition principle, a hallmark of quantum theory, and thereby constrain possible modifications to quantum mechanics1. By increasing the mass of the interfering particles and the macroscopicity of the superposition2, more stringent bounds can be placed on modified quantum theories such as objective collapse models3. Here, we report interference of a molecular library of functionalized oligoporphyrins4 with masses beyond 25,000{\thinspace}Da and consisting of up to 2,000 atoms, by far the heaviest objects shown to exhibit matter-wave interference to date. We demonstrate quantum superposition of these massive particles by measuring interference fringes in a new 2-m-long Talbot--Lau interferometer that permits access to a wide range of particle masses with a large variety of internal states. The molecules in our study have de Broglie wavelengths down to 53{\thinspace}fm, five orders of magnitude smaller than the diameter of the molecules themselves. Our results show excellent agreement with quantum theory and cannot be explained classically. The interference fringes reach more than 90{\%} of the expected visibility and the resulting macroscopicity value of 14.1 represents an order of magnitude increase over previous experiments2.},

Searching for the extremely weak signals produced by this dark matter strongly motivate the development of new, ultra-sensitive detector technologies. Paradigmatic advances in the control and readout of massive mechanical systems, in both the classical and quantum regimes, have enabled unprecedented levels of sensitivity.

To compare the sensitivities of these measurements, estimates using the conventional Yukawa parametrization are introduced. Since these experiments were triggered by the prediction of the large extra-dimension model, experiments performed at different length scales are compared with this prediction. In this paper, a direct comparison between laboratory-scale experiments and the LHC results is presented for the first time. A laboratory experiment is shown to determine the best limit at  and . In addition, new analysis results are described for atomic systems used as gravitational microlaboratories.}

abstract = {For projects such as detecting gravity waves, physicists need to measure tiny forces precisely. Schreppler et al. developed an extremely sensitive method for force measurement. They applied a known force on a cloud of ultracold rubidium atoms in an optical cavity. The force caused the atoms to oscillate, and the researchers used optical measurements to monitor the motion. Under optimal conditions, the authors could measure forces with a level of sensitivity only four times worse than the fundamental limit imposed by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Science, this issue p. 1486 A very sensitive force-measuring technique uses ultracold rubidium atoms in an optical cavity as a mechanical oscillator. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle sets a lower bound on the noise in a force measurement based on continuously detecting a mechanical oscillatorâ€™s position. This bound, the standard quantum limit, can be reached when the oscillator subjected to the force is unperturbed by its environment and when measurement imprecision from photon shot noise is balanced against disturbance from measurement back-action. We applied an external force to the center-of-mass motion of an ultracold atom cloud in a high-finesse optical cavity and measured the resulting motion optically. When the driving force is resonant with the cloudâ€™s oscillation frequency, we achieve a sensitivity that is a factor of 4 above the standard quantum limit and consistent with theoretical predictions given the atomsâ€™ residual thermal disturbance and the photodetection quantum efficiency.}}

abstract={A nitrogen-vacancy (NV−) centre in a nanodiamond, levitated in high vacuum, has recently been proposed as a probe for demonstrating mesoscopic centre-of-mass superpositions and for testing quantum gravity. Here, we study the behaviour of optically levitated nanodiamonds containing NV− centres at sub-atmospheric pressures and show that while they burn in air, this can be prevented by replacing the air with nitrogen. However, in nitrogen the nanodiamonds graphitize below ≈10{\thinspace}mB. Exploiting the Brownian motion of a levitated nanodiamond, we extract its internal temperature (Ti) and find that it would be detrimental to the NV− centre's spin coherence time. These values of Ti make it clear that the diamond is not melting, contradicting a recent suggestion. Additionally, using the measured damping rate of a levitated nanoparticle at a given pressure, we propose a new way of determining its size.},

Key to these experiments is the ability to measure weak forces. Here, we report on force sensing experiments with a sensitivity of 12 zN Hz−1/2 at a temperature of 1.2 K using a resonator made of a carbon nanotube. An ultrasensitive method based on cross-correlated electrical noise measurements, in combination with parametric downconversion, is used to detect the low-amplitude vibrations of the nanotube induced by weak forces. The force sensitivity is quantified by applying a known capacitive force. This detection method also allows us to measure the Brownian vibrations of the nanotube down to cryogenic temperatures. Force sensing with nanotube resonators offers new opportunities for detecting and manipulating individual nuclear spins as well as for magnetometry measurements.},

We use the ac detection method which senses the force gradient acting on a small magnetic tip due to fields emanating from the domain structure in the sample. Tip fabrication procedures are described for two types of magnetic tips: etched tungsten wires with a sputter‐deposited magnetic coating and etched nickel wires. The etched nickel wires are shown to have an apex radius on the order of 30 nm and a taper half‐angle of approximately 3°. Lorentz‐mode transmission electron microscopy of the nickel tips reveals that the final 20 μm is essentially single domain with magnetization approximately parallel with the tip axis. Images of written bit transitions are presented for several types of magnetic media, including CoPtCr, CoSm, and CoCr thin films, as well as γ‐Fe2O3 particulate media. In general, the written magnetization patterns are seen with high contrast and with resolution better than 100 nm. A number of magnetic recording applications are discussed, including the investigation of overwrite behavior and the writing characteristics in CoSm media at high data density. Computer calculations were performed to simulate the MFM response to written magnetic transitions. By including the extended geometry of the tip, the nonparallel orientation of the cantilever, and the finite width of the magnetic transitions, good agreement with experiment was obtained. The model calculations correctly predict the experimentally observed change in image contrast that occurs as a function of tip orientation. Computer calculations showing the dependence of resolution on tip geometry are also presented.}",

title = {Multidimensional optomechanical cantilevers for high-frequency force sensing},
journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {High-frequency atomic force microscopy has enabled extraordinary new science through large bandwidth, high-speed measurements of atomic and molecular structures. However, traditional optical detection schemes restrict the dimensions, and therefore the frequency, of the cantileverâ€”ultimately setting a limit to the time resolution of experiments. Here we demonstrate optomechanical detection of low-mass, high-frequency nanomechanical cantilevers (up to 20 MHz) and anticipate their use for single-molecule force measurements. These cantilevers achieve 2 fm  displacement noise floors, and force sensitivity down to 132 aN . Furthermore, the ability to resolve both in-plane and out-of-plane motion of our cantilevers makes them excellent candidates for ultrasensitive multidimensional force spectroscopy, and optomechanical interactions, such as tuning of the cantilever frequency in situ, provide opportunities in high-speed, high-resolution experiments.}

abstract={Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is well known as a powerful technique for visualizing subsurface structures with three-dimensional spatial resolution. Pushing the resolution below 1?{\textmu}m remains a major challenge, however, owing to the sensitivity limitations of conventional inductive detection techniques. Currently, the smallest volume elements in an image must contain at least 1012 nuclear spins for MRI-based microscopy1, or 107 electron spins for electron spin resonance microscopy2. Magnetic resonance force microscopy (MRFM) was proposed as a means to improve detection sensitivity to the single-spin level, and thus enable three-dimensional imaging of macromolecules (for example, proteins) with atomic resolution3,4. MRFM has also been proposed as a qubit readout device for spin-based quantum computers5,6. Here we report the detection of an individual electron spin by MRFM. A spatial resolution of 25?nm in one dimension was obtained for an unpaired spin in silicon dioxide. The measured signal is consistent with a model in which the spin is aligned parallel or anti-parallel to the effective field, with a rotating-frame relaxation time of 760?ms. The long relaxation time suggests that the state of an individual spin can be monitored for extended periods of time, even while subjected to a complex set of manipulations that are part of the MRFM measurement protocol.},

abstract={Early experiments with transiting circular Rydberg atoms in a superconducting resonator laid the foundations of modern cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics1, and helped explore the defining features of quantum mechanics such as entanglement. Whereas ultracold atoms and superconducting circuits have since taken rather independent paths in the exploration of new physics, taking advantage of their complementary strengths in an integrated system enables access to fundamentally new parameter regimes and device capabilities2,3. Here we report on such a system, coupling an ensemble of cold 85Rb atoms simultaneously to an, as far as we are aware, first-of-its-kind optically accessible, three-dimensional superconducting resonator4 and a vibration-suppressed optical cavity in a cryogenic (5{\thinspace}K) environment. To demonstrate the capabilities of this platform, and with an eye towards quantum networking5, we leverage the strong coupling between Rydberg atoms and the superconducting resonator to implement a quantum-enabled millimetre wave (mmwave) photon to optical photon transducer6. We measured an internal conversion efficiency of 58(11){\%}, a conversion bandwidth of 360(20){\thinspace}kHz and added thermal noise of 0.6{\thinspace}photons, in agreement with a parameter-free theory. Extensions of this technique will allow near-unity efficiency transduction in both the mmwave and microwave regimes. More broadly, our results open a new field of hybrid mmwave/optical quantum science, with prospects for operation deep in the strong coupling regime for efficient generation of metrologically or computationally useful entangled states7 and quantum simulation/computation with strong non-local interactions8.},

abstract = {Coherent scattering of photons is a novel mechanism of optomechanical coupling for optically levitated nanoparticles promising strong, versatile interactions with light and between nanoparticles. We show that it allows efficient deterministic generation of Gaussian entanglement between two particles in separate tweezers. A combination of red- and blue-detuned tweezers brings a mechanical Bogoliubov mode to its ground state. An additional, dispersively coupled cavity mode can reduce noise in the orthogonal mode, resulting in strong entanglement as quantified by the logarithmic negativity and verifiable with the Duan criterion for realistic experimental parameters. Such an important resource for quantum sensing and quantum simulations is pivotal for current experiments and presents an important step towards optomechanics with multiple particles in the quantum regime.}

abstract={Laser cooling has given a boost to atomic physics throughout the last 30 years, as it allows one to prepare atoms in motional states, which can only be described by quantum mechanics. Most methods rely, however, on a near-resonant and cyclic coupling between laser light and well-defined internal states, which has remained a challenge for mesoscopic particles. An external cavity may compensate for the lack of internal cycling transitions in dielectric objects and it may provide assistance in the cooling of their centre-of-mass state. Here we demonstrate cavity cooling of the transverse kinetic energy of silicon nanoparticles freely propagating in high vacuum (<10−8{\thinspace}mbar). We create and launch them with longitudinal velocities down to v≤1{\thinspace}m{\thinspace}s−1 using laser-induced ablation of a pristine silicon wafer. Their interaction with the light of a high-finesse infrared cavity reduces their transverse kinetic energy by up to a factor of 30.},

Recent experiments have demonstrated parametric feedback cooling, nonequilibrium physics, and temperature detection, all in the classical regime. Here we provide the first quantum model for trapped nanoparticle cooling and force sensing. In contrast to existing theories, our work indicates that the nanomechanical ground state may be prepared without using an optical resonator; that the cooling mechanism corresponds to nonlinear friction; and that the energy loss during cooling is nonexponential in time. Our results show excellent agreement with experimental data in the classical limit, and constitute an underlying theoretical framework for experiments aiming at ground state preparation. Our theory also addresses the optimization of, and the fundamental quantum limit to, force sensing, thus providing theoretical direction to ongoing searches for ultraweak forces using levitated nanoparticles.},

abstract={The quantum ground state of a massive mechanical system is a stepping stone for investigating macroscopic quantum states and building high fidelity sensors. With the recent achievement of ground-state cooling of a single motional mode, levitated nanoparticles have entered the quantum domain. To overcome detrimental cross-coupling and decoherence effects, quantum control needs to be expanded to more system dimensions, but the effect of a decoupled dark mode has so far hindered cavity-based ground-state cooling of multiple mechanical modes. Here, we demonstrate two-dimensional ground-state cooling of an optically levitated nanoparticle. Utilizing coherent scattering into an optical cavity mode, we reduce the occupation numbers of two separate centre-of-mass modes to 0.83 and 0.81, respectively. By controlling the frequency separation and the cavity coupling strengths of the nanoparticle's mechanical modes, we show the transition from 1D to 2D ground-state cooling. This 2D control lays the foundations for quantum-limited orbital angular momentum states for rotation sensing and, combined with ground-state cooling along the third motional axis shown previously, may allow full 3D ground-state cooling of a massive object.},

  abstract={The most striking feature of quantum mechanics is the existence of superposition states, where an object appears to be in different situations at the same time. The existence of such states has been previously tested with small objects, such as atoms, ions, electrons and photons (Zoller et al 2005 Eur. Phys. J. D 36 203–28), and even with molecules (Arndt et al 1999 Nature 401 680–2). More recently, it has been shown that it is possible to create superpositions of collections of photons (Deléglise et al 2008 Nature 455 510–14), atoms (Hammerer et al 2008 arXiv:0807.3358) or Cooper pairs (Friedman et al 2000 Nature 406 43–6). Very recent progress in optomechanical systems may soon allow us to create superpositions of even larger objects, such as micro-sized mirrors or cantilevers (Marshall et al 2003 Phys. Rev. Lett. 91 130401; Kippenberg and Vahala 2008 Science 321 1172–6; Marquardt and Girvin 2009 Physics 2 40; Favero and Karrai 2009 Nature Photon. 3 201–5), and thus to test quantum mechanical phenomena at larger scales. Here we propose a method to cool down and create quantum superpositions of the motion of sub-wavelength, arbitrarily shaped dielectric objects trapped inside a high-finesse cavity at a very low pressure. Our method is ideally suited for the smallest living organisms, such as viruses, which survive under low-vacuum pressures (Rothschild and Mancinelli 2001 Nature 406 1092–101) and optically behave as dielectric objects (Ashkin and Dziedzic 1987 Science 235 1517–20). This opens up the possibility of testing the quantum nature of living organisms by creating quantum superposition states in very much the same spirit as the original Schrödinger's cat 'gedanken' paradigm (Schrödinger 1935 Naturwissenschaften 23 807–12, 823–8, 844–9). We anticipate that our paper will be a starting point for experimentally addressing fundamental questions, such as the role of life and consciousness in quantum mechanics.}

title = {Combined feedback and sympathetic cooling of a mechanical oscillator coupled to ultracold atoms},
journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {A promising route to novel quantum technologies are hybrid quantum systems, which combine the advantages of several individual quantum systems. We have realized a hybrid atomic-mechanical experiment consisting of a Si3N4 membrane oscillator cryogenically precooled to 500 mK and optically coupled to a cloud of laser cooled 87Rb atoms. Here, we demonstrate active feedback cooling of the oscillator to a minimum mode occupation of  corresponding to a mode temperature of TminÂ â‰ˆÂ 200 Î¼K. Furthermore, we characterize in detail the coupling of the membrane to the atoms by means of sympathetic cooling. By simultaneously applying both cooling methods we demonstrate the possibility of preparing the oscillator near the motional ground state while it is coupled to the atoms. Realistic modifications of our setup will enable the creation of a ground state hybrid quantum system, which opens the door for coherent quantum state transfer, teleportation and entanglement as well as quantum enhanced sensing applications.}

abstract={Observing and controlling macroscopic quantum systems has long been a driving force in quantum physics research. In particular, strong coupling between individual quantum systems and mechanical oscillators is being actively studied1--3. Whereas both read-out of mechanical motion using coherent control of spin systems4--9 and single-spin read-out using pristine oscillators have been demonstrated10,11, temperature control of the motion of a macroscopic object using long-lived electronic spins has not been reported. Here we observe a spin-dependent torque and spin-cooling of the motion of a trapped microdiamond. Using a combination of microwave and laser excitation enables the spins of nitrogen--vacancy centres to act on the diamond orientation and to cool the diamond libration via a dynamical back-action. Furthermore, by driving the system in the nonlinear regime, we demonstrate bistability and self-sustained coherent oscillations stimulated by spin--mechanical coupling, which offers the prospect of spin-driven generation of non-classical states of motion. Such a levitating diamond---held in position by electric field gradients   under vacuum---can operate as a `compass' with controlled dissipation and has potential use in high-precision torque sensing12--14, emulation of the spin-boson problem15 and probing of quantum phase transitions16. In the single-spin limit17 and using ultrapure nanoscale diamonds, it could allow quantum non-demolition read-out of the spin of nitrogen--vacancy centres at ambient conditions, deterministic entanglement between distant individual spins18 and matter-wave interferometry16,19,20.},

To better understand this system, we investigate the effects of trap power and measure the absolute internal temperature of levitated nanodiamonds with ESR after calibration of the strain effect. We also observe that oxygen and helium gases have different effects on both the photoluminescence and the ESR contrast of nanodiamond NV centres, indicating potential applications of NV centres in oxygen gas sensing.

We consider a configuration where a magnetic field gradient couples the mechanical oscillation of the diamond with its spin degree of freedom provided by a nitrogen vacancy center. First, we investigate the measurement of the position spectrum of the mechanical oscillator. We find that conditions of ultrahigh vacuum and feedback cooling allow a magnetic field gradient sensitivity of 1\&\#x003BC;Tm\&\#x02212;1\&\#x0002F;Hz. At high pressure and room temperature, this sensitivity degrades and can attain a value of the order of 100mTm\&\#x02212;1\&\#x0002F;Hz. Subsequently, we characterize the magnetic field gradient sensitivity obtainable by maneuvering the spin degrees of freedom using Ramsey interferometry. We find that this technique can offer photon-shot noise and spin-projection noise limited magnetic field gradient sensitivity of 100\&\#x003BC;Tm\&\#x02212;1\&\#x0002F;Hz. We conclude that this hybrid levitated nanomechanical magnetometer provides a favorable and versatile platform for sensing applications.},

abstract={Nano- and micromechanical oscillators with high quality (Q)-factors have gained much attention for their potential application as ultrasensitive detectors. In contrast to micro-fabricated devices, optically trapped nanoparticles in vacuum do not suffer from clamping losses, hence leading to much larger Q-factors. We find that for a levitated nanoparticle the thermal energy suffices to drive the motion of the nanoparticle into the nonlinear regime. First, we experimentally measure and fully characterize the frequency fluctuations originating from thermal motion and nonlinearities. Second, we demonstrate that feedback cooling can be used to mitigate these fluctuations. The high level of control allows us to fully exploit the force-sensing capabilities of the nanoresonator. Our approach offers a force sensitivity of 20{\thinspace}zN{\thinspace}Hz−1/2, which is the highest value reported so far at room temperature, sufficient to sense ultraweak interactions, such as non-Newtonian gravity-like forces.},

However, no such demonstration exists for mesoscopic levitated optomechanical systems, which are emerging as important platforms for conducting fundamental tests of quantum mechanics13--15 and gravity16, as well as for developing sensing modalities that couple mechanical motion to electron spin17--20 and charge21. Inspired by the pioneering work of Arthur Ashkin on optical tweezers22,23, we introduce a mesoscopic, frequency-tunable phonon laser based on the centre-of-mass oscillation of a silica nanosphere levitated in an optical tweezer under vacuum. Unlike previous levitated realizations, our scheme is general enough to be used on single electrons, liquid droplets or even small biological organisms24. Our device thus provides a pathway for a coherent source of phonons on the mesoscale that can be applied to both fundamental problems in quantum mechanics as well as tasks of precision metrology25--27.},

abstract={Quantum control of a system requires the manipulation of quantum states faster than any decoherence rate. For mesoscopic systems, this has so far only been reached by few cryogenic systems. An important milestone towards quantum control is the so-called strong coupling regime, which in cavity optomechanics corresponds to an optomechanical coupling strength larger than cavity decay rate and mechanical damping. Here, we demonstrate the strong coupling regime at room temperature between a levitated silica particle and a high finesse optical cavity. Normal mode splitting is achieved by employing coherent scattering, instead of directly driving the cavity. The coupling strength achieved here approaches three times the cavity linewidth, crossing deep into the strong coupling regime. Entering the strong coupling regime is an essential step towards quantum control with mesoscopic objects at room temperature.},

abstract={Matter-wave interferometry performed with massive objects elucidates their wave nature and thus tests the quantum superposition principle at large scales. Whereas standard quantum theory places no limit on particle size, alternative, yet untested theories---conceived to explain the apparent quantum to classical transition---forbid macroscopic superpositions. Here we propose an interferometer with a levitated, optically cooled and then free-falling silicon nanoparticle in the mass range of one million atomic mass units, delocalized over >150{\thinspace}nm. The scheme employs the near-field Talbot effect with a single standing-wave laser pulse as a phase grating. Our analysis, which accounts for all relevant sources of decoherence, indicates that this is a viable route towards macroscopic high-mass superpositions using available technology.},

Gonzalez-Ballestero et al. provide an overview of the status, challenges, and prospects of levitodynamics, the multidisciplinary research area that focuses on the understanding and control of optical trapping of microparticles and nanoparticles in vacuum, with the goal of eventually using such levitated particles as ultrasensitive probes for sensing applications. â€”ISO A review outlines the challenges and prospects of controlling levitated nano- and micro-objects in a vacuum. The control of levitated nano- and micro-objects in vacuumâ€”which capitalizes on scientific achievements in the fields of atomic physics, control theory, and optomechanicsâ€”is of considerable interest. The ability to couple the motion of levitated systems to internal degrees of freedom, as well as to external forces and systems, provides opportunities for science and technology. Attractive research directions, ranging from fundamental quantum physics to commercial sensors, have been unlocked by the many recent experimental achievements, including motional ground-state cooling of an optically levitated nanoparticle. Here we review the status, challenges, and prospects of levitodynamics, the multidisciplinary research area devoted to understanding, controlling, and using levitated nano- and micro-objects in vacuum.}}

	title = {Toward quantum superposition of living organisms},
	journal = {New Journal of Physics},
	abstract = {The most striking feature of quantum mechanics is the existence of superposition states, where an object appears to be in different situations at the same time. The existence of such states has been previously tested with small objects, such as atoms, ions, electrons and photons (Zoller et al 2005 Eur. Phys. J. D 36 203â€“28), and even with molecules (Arndt et al 1999 Nature 401 680â€“2). More recently, it has been shown that it is possible to create superpositions of collections of photons (DelÃ©glise et al 2008 Nature 455 510â€“14), atoms (Hammerer et al 2008 arXiv:0807.3358) or Cooper pairs (Friedman et al 2000 Nature 406 43â€“6). Very recent progress in optomechanical systems may soon allow us to create superpositions of even larger objects, such as micro-sized mirrors or cantilevers (Marshall et al 2003 Phys. Rev. Lett. 91 130401; Kippenberg and Vahala 2008 Science 321 1172â€“6; Marquardt and Girvin 2009 Physics 2 40; Favero and Karrai 2009 Nature Photon. 3 201â€“5), and thus to test quantum mechanical phenomena at larger scales. Here we propose a method to cool down and create quantum superpositions of the motion of sub-wavelength, arbitrarily shaped dielectric objects trapped inside a high-finesse cavity at a very low pressure. Our method is ideally suited for the smallest living organisms, such as viruses, which survive under low-vacuum pressures (Rothschild and Mancinelli 2001 Nature 406 1092â€“101) and optically behave as dielectric objects (Ashkin and Dziedzic 1987 Science 235 1517â€“20). This opens up the possibility of testing the quantum nature of living organisms by creating quantum superposition states in very much the same spirit as the original SchrÃ¶dinger's cat â€˜gedankenâ€™ paradigm (SchrÃ¶dinger 1935 Naturwissenschaften 23 807â€“12, 823â€“8, 844â€“9). We anticipate that our paper will be a starting point for experimentally addressing fundamental questions, such as the role of life and consciousness in quantum mechanics.}

In this tutorial, we provide a primer on how to calibrate optical tweezers and how to use them for advanced applications. After a brief general introduction on optical tweezers, we focus on describing and comparing the various available calibration techniques. Then, we discuss some cutting-edge applications of optical tweezers in a liquid medium, namely, to study single-molecule and single-cell mechanics, microrheology, colloidal interactions, statistical physics, and transport phenomena. Finally, we consider optical tweezers in vacuum, where the absence of a viscous medium offers vastly different dynamics and presents new challenges. We conclude with some perspectives for the field and the future applications of optical tweezers. This tutorial provides both a step-by-step guide ideal for non-specialists entering the field and a comprehensive manual of advanced techniques useful for expert practitioners. All of the examples are complemented by the sample data and software necessary to reproduce them.},

@article{levreview,
	abstract = { We review recent works on optomechanics of optically trapped microspheres and nanoparticles in vacuum, which provide an ideal system for studying macroscopic quantum mechanics and ultrasensitive force detection. An optically trapped particle in vacuum has an ultrahigh mechanical quality factor as it is well-isolated from the thermal environment. Its oscillation frequency can be tuned in real time by changing the power of the trapping laser. Furthermore, an optically trapped particle in vacuum may rotate freely, a unique property that does not exist in clamped mechanical oscillators. In this review, we will introduce the current status of optical trapping of dielectric particles in air and vacuum, Brownian motion of an optically trapped particle at room temperature, Feedback cooling and cavity cooling of the Brownian motion. We will also discuss about using optically trapped dielectric particles for studying macroscopic quantum mechanics and ultrasensitive force detection. Applications range from creating macroscopic Schr{\~A}¶dinger's cat state, testing objective collapse models of quantum wavefunctions, measuring Casimir force, searching short-range non-Newtonian gravity, to detect gravitational waves. },

@article{chang2009,
	abstract = {Recently, remarkable advances have been made in coupling a number of high-Q modes of nano-mechanical systems to high-finesse optical cavities, with the goal of reaching regimes in which quantum behavior can be observed and leveraged toward new applications. To reach this regime, the coupling between these systems and their thermal environments must be minimized. Here we propose a novel approach to this problem, in which optically levitating a nano-mechanical system can greatly reduce its thermal contact, while simultaneously eliminating dissipation arising from clamping. Through the long coherence times allowed, this approach potentially opens the door to ground-state cooling and coherent manipulation of a single mesoscopic mechanical system or entanglement generation between spatially separate systems, even in room-temperature environments. As an example, we show that these goals should be achievable when the mechanical mode consists of the center-of-mass motion of a levitated nanosphere.},

@article{ligosusp,
	abstract = {The detection of gravitational waves remains one of the most challenging prospects faced by experimental physicists. One of the most significant limits to the sensitivity of current, and future, long-baseline interferometric gravitational wave detectors is thermal displacement noise of the test masses and their suspensions. Suspension thermal noise will be an important noise source at operating frequencies between approximately 10 and 30 Hz, and it results from a combination of thermoelastic damping, surface loss and bulk loss associated with the suspension fibres, and weld loss from their attachment. Its effects can be reduced by minimizing thermoelastic loss and optimizing pendulum dilution factor via the appropriate choice of geometry of the suspension fibre and attachment geometry. This paper will discuss the design and fabrication of a prototype of the fused silica suspension stage for use in the advanced LIGO (aLIGO) detector network, analysing in detail the design of the fused silica attachment pieces (ears), together with the suspension assembly techniques. We also present a full thermal noise analysis of the prototype suspension, taking into account for the first time the precise shape of the actual fibres used, and weld loss. We shall demonstrate the suitability of this suspension for installation into aLIGO.},

journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {Cooling to the motional ground state is an important first step in the preparation of nonclassical states of mesoscopic mechanical oscillators. Light-mediated coupling to a remote atomic ensemble has been proposed as a method to reach the ground state for low frequency oscillators. The ground state can also be reached using optical measurement followed by feedback control. Here we investigate the possibility of enhanced cooling by combining these two approaches. The combination, in general, outperforms either individual technique, though atomic ensemble-based cooling and feedback cooling each individually dominate over large regions of parameter space.}
