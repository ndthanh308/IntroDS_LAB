  "abstract": "Recent LHAASO observations of the prompt emission phase of the brightest-of-all-time GRB 221009A imposes a stringent limit on the flux ratio between the TeV and MeV emissions, $F_{\\rm TeV}/F_{\\rm MeV}\\le 2\\times10^{-5}$, during the period $220 \\operatorname{-}230\\, {\\rm s}$ after the trigger. bf This period covers the peak of the main MeV burst and is just before the TeV afterglow emerges. Within the framework of internal shocks, we study the internal $γγ$ absorption in GRB 221009A by generating a set of synthetic bursts in a simulation that reproduces the observed feature of GRB 221009A. We find that the $γγ$ absorption does not lead to an exponential cutoff, but rather a power-law spectrum, consistent with previous works. We further find that the attenuation due to $γγ$ absorption alone cannot explain the flux limit ratio of GRB 221009A, suggesting a low ratio between synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) and synchrotron emission outputs. This requires the magnetic field energy density to be much larger than the synchrotron photon energy density so that the SSC flux is greatly suppressed. This indicates that the jet composition of GRB 221009A is likely Poynting-flux-dominated.",
