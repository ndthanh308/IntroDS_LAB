  "abstract": "The disk graph of a handlebody H of gneus $g\\geq 2$ with $m\\geq 0$ marked points on the boundary is the graph whose vertices are isotopy classes of disks disjoint from the marked points and where two vertices are connected by an edge of length one if they can be realized disjointly. We show that for m=2 the disk graph contains quasi-isometrically embedded copies of $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Furthermore, the sphere graph of the doubled handlebody of genus $g\\geq 4$ with two marked points contains for every $n\\geq 1$ a quasi-isometrically embedded copy of $\\mathbb{R}^n$.",
