  "abstract": "We conducted a global comparative analysis of the coverage of American topics in different language versions of Wikipedia, using over 90 million Wikidata items and 40 million Wikipedia articles in 58 languages. Our study aimed to investigate whether Americanization is more or less dominant in different regions and cultures and to determine whether interest in American topics is universal.",
