abstract = {Polymer syntactic foams are lightweight composites made of hollow particles such as Glass Micro-Balloons (GMBs) or cenospheres reinforced in a polymer matrix. We demonstrate for the first time that the size of the GMB controls the interior microscale architecture of syntactic foams with matrix segregation achieved through the selective laser sintering - additive manufacturing process. This manifests as paradoxical macroscale mechanical responses. GMBs with a diameter larger than the gaps between the segregated matrix's cell walls get lodged between and in the cell walls, whereas those with a diameter smaller than the gaps are likely to get lodged inside the cell walls. As a result, larger particles contribute significantly to the stiffness of syntactic foams, whereas smaller particles have a relatively negligible effect. Larger particles with lower crushing strength lowered the densification stress of the foam. In contrast, the foam with smaller particles with higher crushing strength behaved similarly to pure TPU but with substantially less weight. Overall, we show that combining reinforcement parameters with print parameters enables the design and fabrication of hierarchical customized structures and functional features in 3D printed syntactic foams. These findings can be applied to create and design lightweight sandwich structure cores for marine and aerospace applications.},

abstract = {The dynamic‐mechanical properties of high density polyethylene filled with 20\% by volume of untreated glass spheres or glass spheres treated with a silane‐based coupling agent were studied as a function of temperature and imposed tensile deformation. The coupling agent used is capable of providing covalent bonding between the polymeric matrix and the glass spheres. It is assumed that an interphase region is formed in the matrix around each filler particle with properties depending on the surface treatment of the filler, but different to that of the bulk matrix. It is shown how the mechanical loss factor can be used to characterize the properties of the interphase region and the degree of adhesion between the two phases, as affected by the surface treatment. We suggest that these kinds of measurements can be valuable when determining the effectiveness of various surface treatments of filler particles from a mechanical point of view.

abstract = {Hollow glass microsphere (HGM) filled low-density polyethylene (LDPE) composites were prepared, and the effects of density, content, and surface modification of HGM on the thermal and dielectric properties of the composites were investigated. It is found that the thermal conductivity of the composites decreases with increasing HGM content or decreasing HGM density. At the same HGM content and density, the composites filled with suitable amount of silane coupling agent (KH570) modified HGM exhibit higher thermal conductivity than unmodified-HGM filled composites. The dielectric constant at 1 MHz of the composites also decreases with increasing HGM content or decreasing HGM density, but their dielectric loss increases with increasing HGM content or increasing HGM density. By modifying the surface of HGM with suitable amount of KH570, the dielectric constant and loss at 1 MHz of the composites can be decreased at the same time. The results of microwave dielectric properties of the composites indicate that the dielectric constant decreases with increasing HGM content or decreasing HGM density, the quality factor (Q × f) decreases with increasing HGM content or increasing HGM density, but both dielectric constant and quality factor are slightly affected by the surface modification of HGM. Due to lower intrinsic thermal conductivity and dielectric constant but higher dielectric loss of HGM than LDPE, the thermal conductivity and dielectric properties of the composites can be controlled with adding HGM and varying its volume fraction. The surface modification of HGM improves the interface contact between HGM and LDPE in the composites, which is confirmed by the SEM observation, and thus the heat conduction and dielectric properties at low frequency are improved. Based on calculated thermal conductivity and dielectric constant of HGM, the experimental trends of thermal conductivity and dielectric constant at 1 MHz of the composites are analyzed by using different models, including typical models for particles-filled composites and special models developed for hollow microsphere filled composites. The results from suitable models show close correlation with the experimental values.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Most of the works published in the literature only consider electrostriction at room temperature at a given frequency. In this work, it is shown that electrostrictive coefficient ME is divided by 3-10 at increasing frequency over 3 decades of frequency, depending on the ratio of hard to soft segments in PU. Thus it is important to analyze the energy conversion efficiency by investigating the dielectric and viscoelastic properties. This work deals with the study of dielectric properties of 3 PU with different fractions of hard segments. Three relaxation phenomena ($\beta$, $\alpha$ and conduction) were investigated for each PU in the temperature-frequency range studied here, in order to optimize the copolymer composition in view of their best efficiency as actuators or mechanical energy harvesting devices.},

abstract = {The electromechanical behavior of thermoplastic elastomer polyurethane (TPE-PU) is investigated under the effects of urethane type (ester and ether-types) and soft-hard segments at various electric field strengths and temperatures. The highest dielectric constant, electrical breakdown strength, and specific conductivity belong to the ester-type polyurethane (LPR matrix), while the lowest values are obtained from the ether-type polyurethane composing predominantly with the soft-segment (E 80A matrix). Under the electric field strength in the range between 0 and 2 kV/mm, the LPR matrix attains the storage modulus sensitivity ($\Delta$G′/G′0) up to 2 at 2 kV/mm. For the temporal response, the polyurethanes behave with good reproductively (number of cycles >105 times) and with very good recoverability. The steady state behavior can be attained at the first actuation and at the electric field strength of 1 kV/mm. Furthermore, the storage modulus (G′) shows linearly negative responses with increasing temperature. In the deflection experiments, the deflection distance and the dielectrophoresis force increase monotonically with increasing electric field strength. All of the TPE-PU possesses very fast response times for activation (<10 s.) and deactivation (<5 s.). TPE-PU material is systematically shown here to be a potentially good actuator material with high efficiency based on the electrostrictive performance data obtained. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.

A conventional ester based TPU grade formulated from 4,4'-methylene diphenyl diisocyanate, 1,4-butanediol and polycaprolactone was investigated. Exposure to UV was done in a Suntest CPS+ at different exposure times. Thermal treatment was done in an air circulation oven at 180-°C and different exposure times. Exposed samples were characterized as to changes in molecular structure with complementary methods ATR and Raman spectroscopy. To establish interrelationships between structural changes and macroscopic material characteristics UV/Vis/NIR spectroscopy and DSC were applied. UV/Vis/NIR spectroscopy clearly indicated yellowing, and thus an increase in absorption in the visible wavelength range, of TPU after exposure to UV or to thermal load. Yellowing correlated well with formation of chromophoric groups detected by ATR and Raman spectroscopy. ATR spectroscopy turned out to be very sensitive in detection of changes in chemical structure induced by UV radiation. Raman spectroscopy was found to be very sensitive in detection of changes in chemical structure induced by thermal load. No distinct effect of UV exposure on morphology of TPU was ascertained. In contrast, a strong effect of thermal treatment on (para)crystalline morphology was observed. {\textcopyright} 2014 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

abstract = {The temperature dependence of hydrogen bonding in 2, 4-TDI and 2, 6-TDI based polyurethanes was investigated using simple procedures to resolve hydrogen bonded and nonbonded NH and carbonyl. The fraction of hydrogen bonded carbonyl was used as a measure of the extent of interurethane hydrogen bonding. The onset temperature for dissociation of both hydrogen bonded NH and carbonyl in 2, 6-TDI polymers occurs at 65 °C, independent of urethane content and well below the melting temperature of crystalline hard segment structure (130 to 170 °C). For 2, 4-TDI polyurethanes the onset temperature for dissociation of hydrogen bonded NH occurs at 40 to 60 °C, close to the transition temperature for amorphous domain structure, but there is little change in hydrogen bonded carbonyl up to the highest temperature studied (150 °C). Heats of dissociation were about 4 kcal/mol in both series. The 2, 4-TDI results demonstrate the preferential dissociation of urethane to soft segment bonding and, by contrast with the lower stability of interurethane bonding in 2, 6-TDI samples, suggest that hydrogen bonding to the 4 position of the TDI ring is stronger than the 2 position. The structural implications of the 2, 6-TDI and 2, 4-TDI results are discussed. Overall, the behavior indicates that the cause of hydrogen bond dissociation bears little relation to the state of structural organization. {\textcopyright} 1977, American Chemical Society.

Understanding the behavior of such foams under extreme conditions is critical for exploring their suitability for constructing lightweight platforms used in arctic explorations, which are exposed to subzero temperatures for extended periods of time potentially degrading their mechanical properties. In the research study presented here, samples of cenosphere/epoxy syntactic foams were conditioned under arctic environment at a temperature of −60 °C for a period of 57 days. Compression tests were then conducted at room temperature as well as in-situ −60 °C on the conditioned samples and compared against unconditioned samples tested at room temperature. Combinations of surface modification and cenosphere volume fractions were considered. For the case of unconditioned samples, compressive strength decreased with increasing cenosphere volume fraction for both surface modified and unmodified cenospheres. For the arctic conditioned samples, cenospheres/epoxy foams did not present visible signs of degradation prior to testing, but manifested a reduction in compressive modulus in a range of 47–57\% and 47–65\% for untreated and treated cenospheres/epoxy syntactic foams as compared to their unconditioned counterparts. On the other hand, the compressive strength increased in a range between 32–68\% for untreated and 59–80\% for treated cenosphere foams in arctic environment, which can be attributed to the matrix hardening introduced by frigid in-situ environment. Also, under in-situ arctic compressive loading, the post peak response for all foam types have shifted from a progressive failure to a brittle type behavior.},

Syntactic foams are lightweight porous composites that found their early applications in marine structures due to their naturally buoyant behavior and low moisture absorption. Their light weight has been beneficial in weight sensitive aerospace structures. Syntactic foams have pushed the performance boundaries for composites and have enabled the development of vehicles for traveling to the deepest parts of the ocean and to other planets. The high volume fraction of porosity in syntactic foams also enabled their applications in thermal insulation of pipelines in oil and gas industry. The possibility of tailoring the mechanical and thermal properties of syntactic foams through a combination of material selection, hollow particle volume fraction, and hollow particle wall thickness has helped in rapidly growing these applications. The low coefficient of thermal expansion and dimensional stability at high temperatures are now leading their use in electronic packaging, composite tooling, and thermoforming plug assists. Methods have been developed to tailor the mechanical and thermal properties of syntactic foams independent of each other over a wide range, which is a significant advantage over other traditional particulate and fibrous composites. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society.},

From the stress舑strain measurements, it showed that the polyester-urethane samples aged under a high prestrain, particularly at high temperature, resulted in decreases of the initial slope, and stress and elongation at break. The behavior of stress舑strain curves also showed that aging the polyester-urethane at a higher prestrain and a higher temperature leaded the urethane elastomer to be more brittle. Morphological changes which were induced in the segmented elastomer by aging under strain were investigated by DSC in terms of the glass transition temperature of the soft segments, the melting temperature of the hard segments, and the heat of fusion of the crystalline hard segments.

Nanocomposite TPU containing OMLSs were prepared by melt blending at different concentrations. The addition of OMLS has both induced variation in enthalpy of melting of hard and soft phases, and influenced the glass transition temperature of soft domains, as result of the microdomain phase segregation measured by means of fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR). Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) analysis has shown that the mean distance between hard domains was mostly unaffected by the filler. However, its distribution broadened with the increasing concentration of the OMLSs, resulting in increased extent of the hard domain interface. The storage modulus of TPU nanocomposites incremented with the silicate content, while the dynamic strain scan tests showed pronounced non linear viscoelastic behavior. The analysis of morphological data obtained by SAXS and FT-IR measurements were correlated to thermal and dynamic mechanical properties of TPU samples suggesting a crucial role of the soft domains interface. The storage modulus and loss tangent of TPU nanocomposites were found to increase with the increasing of the interface area of soft domains with both hard domains and OMLS stacks. {\textcopyright} 2010 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

The decrease of modulus of the TPU blends after immersion in water (softening of TPU), and the interesting increase of modulus of wet samples after losing some free water (hardening of TPU) compared to the dry samples, were observed in this work. By analyzing the change of glass transition temperature, the degree of phase separation of samples after immersion in water, and the types of water and hydrogen bond in samples, the possible mechanism behind the above softening and hardening of wet TPU samples was proposed. The softening and hardening of wet TPU samples were attributed to the change of structure in the interface between hard and soft domains in TPU, which is a combined effect including the plasticization of free water, breakage and/or decreasing the strength of original hydrogen bond by water, and formation of new hydrogen bond (elastic active cross-linking point) by free carbonyl groups in TPU and water etc.},

This comprehensive review attempts to offer a fundamental knowledge base to elucidate energy transfer pathways, mechanisms, various factors governing heat conduction in polymers and interfaces along with identification of various fillers, matrix and techniques for the modification of interfaces to enhance heat conduction. First theoretical basis is used to establish fundamental of heat transfer in molecule, bulk polymeric material and polymer composites and interfaces and then various detailed factors governing the thermal transport of polymer and interfaces are presented. Various recent techniques to improve thermal conductivity of polymer and interfaces are illustrated through examples and case studies. Apart from the traditional technologies (filler and matrix), the recent developments in non-conventional technologies like polymer blends, polymer/inorganic and polymer/organic hybrids, etc. are also presented.

Factors of micro- and macro-characteristics, such as chain structures, interfaces, functionalization and processing techniques, etc., are all illustrated to elucidate their impacts on the thermal conductivities.

@article{Kong2019,
abstract = {Microphase separation and hard segment packing in polyurethanes remain areas of active research interest in order to optimize their performances. In this work, a commercial thermoplastic polyetherurethane (1180A, BASF) is used as a model system to investigate the packing of hard segments during microphase separation. Although DSC studies show several transitions during heating and cooling, no crystal structure is detected by XRD. Nevertheless, these endothermic and exothermic peaks should belong to the complicate hard/soft segment interaction and related structures. Time and temperature dependent FTIR spectra prove fast hydrogen bonding association/dissociation phenomena in the current system. We infer that such fast process can induce loosely or irregular packing of hard segments during cooling. On the other hand, the continuous change of degree of microphase separation with temperature implies different hard domain structures and stabilities at different temperatures. At high temperature, only hard domains with large size and compactly packed segments can survive. This is because the thermodynamic stability of hard domains is decided by the strength of hydrogen bonding and the size of hard domain, similar with classical description of ‘nucleation'. Morphological information obtained by fitting the SAXS curves proves the validity of the above model. Moreover, the significant difference in mechanical properties before and after thermal treatment can be explained by the microstructure model.},

@article{Saiani2007,
abstract = {We have investigated the thermal behavior of a set of model linear thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU) with a relatively high content of hard segments: from 50 to 100 wt \%. The soft segment of these samples consists of poly(propylene oxide), end-capped with ethylene oxide (EO-PPO-EO), while the hard segment is composed of a 4,4'-methylenediphenylene isocyanate (4,4'-MDI) chain extended by a short diol chain, 2-methyl1,3-propanediol (MP-Diol). In the present article, we have investigated the origin of the endotherms observed when samples are annealed below the glass transition of the hard segments T gHs. The work was carried out using mainly differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and small-angle and wide-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS and WAXS). The so-called "annealing endotherm", TA, was observed 20-30 °C above the annealing temperature. The temperature and enthalpy of TA were found to increase linearly with the logarithm of the annealing time. This endotherm was assigned to the relaxation (physical aging) of the interfacial materials. With increasing annealing temperature a change in the appearance of the hard phase glass transition, TgHP, was observed. For long annealing times TgHP is observed as an endotherm on die DSC thermographs. It is suggested that some of the hard segments undergo relaxation below TgHS resulting in an enthalpy relaxation endotherm being present below or around TgHP. An additional endotherm, TM; was observed as a shoulder at high temperature, just below the microphase mixing transition, TMMT. This endotherm is thought to be due to the ordering during the phase separation process of the hard segment present in the mixed phase. Finally TTMM was observed at all annealing temperature used suggesting that even at low annealing temperatures phase separation occurs. The delay time before phase separation starts and the maximum absolute degree of phase separation reached are found to increase with increasing annealing temperature. Our results suggest that a "thermodynamic equilibrium" is reached for each annealing temperature at long enough annealing times. {\textcopyright} 2007 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {The use of plastic films with specific diffusion or permeation properties for industrial applications has grown at a considerable rate. Some useful applications are found in medical devices, bioreactors, and combustible fuel storage where polymer films function as separation membranes that allow permeation of different gases at different rates. In this work, the permeation and diffusion properties of a polyester-based thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) were investigated. TPU injected and extruded specimens were subjected to thermal treatment (annealing) at 100°C for 20 h. Injected samples were exposed to certain hygrothermal conditions and films were prepared to evaluate the influence of annealing on the permeation of gases. In order to achieve a complete analysis, tests such as differential scanning calorimetry, tensile tests, and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy were conducted to examine the morphological changes. These were then correlated to the TPU permeation behavior after annealing. Water uptake by the polymer—measured as weight gain—likely indicates an increase in the free volume in the amorphous domains. Similarly, in permeation and water immersion tests, the diffusion rate of gases and H2O through the TPU was higher for the annealed samples when compared to those without treatment, indicating that diffusion within the polymer is dependent on the postprocessing thermal treatment.

Considering their properties and current applications, elastomeric polymers such as thermoplastic polyurethanes (TPU) have a very high potential in this regard. This study investigates the material properties that are involved in TPU sintering through the analysis of four distinct TPU grades. Examined parameters include powder flow, rheology of the melt and shrinkage and hardening behavior. It is found that, even though the particle morphology is not optimum, smooth and dense powder layers can be deposited for the investigated powders. Low melt viscosity and low shrinkage upon hardening further enable these materials to be easily processed into functional parts. Remaining issues, however, are part porosity and material degradation. The findings in this study provide clear links between material properties and behavior during laser sintering, and result in guidelines for future selection of TPU grades.},

This model is based on four components: uncatalysed hydrolysis, acid-catalysed hydrolysis, carboxylic acid dissociation and competitive carbodiimide-based deactivation of acid. Protons were considered as the key catalyst responsible for the hydrolysis. Model parameters were determined by fitting experimental data measured on unstabilized and stabilized TPUs, aged in immersion from 40 to 90 °C. Scission kinetics were predicted for immersion and 50\% relative humidity conditions, from 10 to 100 °C. Structure-failure property relationships were also investigated, between molar mass and elongation at break. A master curve was established for elongation at break with molar mass, including both TPUs at four ageing temperatures. By combining predictions for scission kinetics with the molar mass-elongation at break master curve and an embrittlement molar mass as the end-of-life criterion, non-Arrhenian lifetime predictions are proposed for all exposure conditions considered.},

Water-sorption experiments, physical and mechanical property tests were performed after immersion in water at a set temperature of 70 °C for up to 6 months. Emphasis was given to the effect of immersion aging on thermal, mechanical and tribological properties. Fickian diffusion behaviour was found during the initial immersion time followed by saturation stage as time progressed. The use of differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) analysis showed that the glass transition temperature (Tg) was sensitive to the effect of hygrothermal aging and it decreased with increasing water uptake. More significantly, the mechanical properties in bulk material, obtained from tensile test, were affected by aging. Elastic modulus and stress at 200\% of strain of the studied TPU were decreased after sufficient exposure to moisture. On the other hand, the mechanical properties of the material surface were equally investigated with the help of an abrasive wear test. A decrease in wear resistance of the aged TPU was discerned. The reversibility of mechanical and physical properties after moisture exposure was also assessed in this study. The polymer degradation was found as irreversible phenomenon. Finally, the evolution of the mechanical properties seems to be well correlated to structural modifications obtained from Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) characterization. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Especially, effect of temperature on water diffusion has been studied. Water-sorption experiments, tensile test and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis (DMTA) were performed after immersion in distilled water at different temperatures (25, 70 and 90°C). The sorption process was analyzed by gravimetric measurements at different temperatures. Also, diffusion coefficients of solvent molecules in the TPU samples were identified. Therefore the activation energy and the mixing enthalpy were deduced. The aging impact on some mechanical properties of this material has been investigated after various aging cycles. Degradation of mechanical properties was observed. In fact, elastic modulus and stress at 200\% of strain were decreased. It was also shown that such degradation largely depends on both aging temperature and aging immersion duration. The storage modulus (E') was also affected by the hygrothermal (HT) environment. The modification of mechanical properties seems to be well correlated to structural observations obtained from scanning electron microscopy (SEM) photographs. Finally, through thermal aging experiments, it was deduced that the combination of temperature with water seems to be a major factor of TPU degradation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

In order to get a better understanding of the mechanism behind this phenomenon, a systematic study on the effects of moisture on the glass transition temperature and thermomechanical properties of this SMP was carried out. The results reveal that the hydrogen bonding between N-H and CO groups is weakened by the absorbed water. Furthermore, the water absorbed into the SMP can be separated into two parts, i.e. the free water and the bound water. Each part inside the SMP was quantified. Bound water significantly reduces the glass transition temperature in an almost linear manner and has a significant influence on the uniaxial tensile behavior, while the effect of free water is negligible. In addition, the recovery stress and recovery strain in constrained/free recovery induced by water were investigated and compared with that induced thermally. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The results indicate that the PDA@TiC were homogenously dispersed in the matrix compared with the pristine TiC, and that the PDA@TiC/TPU composites show improved dielectric and mechanical properties, i.e., much lower dissipation factors and obviously enhanced dielectric breakdown strength, as well as higher tensile strength and elongation at break as compared to the raw TiC/TPU. The nanoscale PDA interlayer contributes to the dielectric and mechanical enhancements because it not only serves as an insulating shell that prevents TiC particles from direct contacting and suppresses the loss and leakage current to very low levels, but also enhances the interfacial interactions thereby leading to improved mechanical strength and toughness.

abstract = {Flexible and electrically conductive carbon nanotube/thermoplastic polyurethane (CNT/TPU) nanocomposites have been herein fabricated by selective laser sintering (SLS) for the applications of wearable electronics and strain sensors. CNT/TPU nanocomposite powders were systematically developed by a latex-based technique. The effects of CNT content on the SLS processability of nanocomposite powders and the mechanical, electrical, and piezoresistive properties of SLS-printed specimens were investigated. It was found that the CNT improved the electrical conductivity and strain sensing performance of the printed parts, but excessively high CNT content led to high melt viscosity, deteriorated sintering behavior, and hence degraded mechanical properties. The 2.0 wt% CNT/TPU nanocomposite fabricated by SLS exhibited enhanced electrical conductivity (seven orders of magnitude higher than the neat TPU), high piezoresistive sensitivity (gauge factor of 60 at a tensile strain of 20%), and a wide sensing range (0‒130% strain). A mathematical model based on the tunneling theory was established to describe and predict the strain sensing performance of the printed nanocomposites. This study provides profound insights into the development of multi-functional nanocomposites by SLS for their applications in flexible strain sensors.},

@article{Zhang2022,
abstract = {With the rapid development of the electronic field, the requirements for thermal management materials are increasing to satisfy the heat dissipation of electronic devices. Due to the shortcomings of low precision and difficulty in forming thermal conductive composites with complex structures in traditional technologies, it is necessary to explore a new forming process. Selective laser sintering (SLS) is an important 3D printing technology, which can manufacture diverse parts with complex shapes and be used in various fields. In this study, TPU/AlN/h-BN/MWCNTs composites were successfully developed by selecting three different dimensions of thermally conductive fillers and combining them with the SLS process. The research shows that the thermal conductivity of TPU composites can reach up to 1.13 W/mK with 20 wt% AlN, 15 wt% h-BN, and 1 wt% MWCNTs hybrid fillers, which is 491 % higher than that of pure TPU, ascribed to the synergistic effect of multi-dimensional fillers. In addition, the tensile strength and elongation at break of TPU/AlN/h-BN/MWCNTs composites maintain 16.5 MPa and 294 %, which still has excellent mechanical properties. This work also investigated the influence of fillers on the SLS process, thermal stability, melting, and crystallization behavior of composites. It reveals an effective, feasible strategy for TPU composites with excellent thermal conductive and complex shapes.},

@article{Gan2019,
abstract = {A general strategy, i.e. simultaneous realization of the conductive segregation network microstructure and minimal surface porous macrostructure by means of selective laser sintering (SLS) 3D printing is proposed for devices fabrication. For the purpose of strategy demonstration, a flexible piezoresistive sensor is fabricated by SLS 3D printing with the use of self-made single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) wrapped thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) powders. The SLS-printed TPU/SWCNTs composite possesses an ultra-low conductive percolation threshold and excellent mechanical strength due to the construction of electrically conductive segregation network microstructure in polymer matrix, what is a prerequisite to a flexible piezoresistive sensor. The minimal surfaces including the Schwarz, Gyroid- and Diamond-structures have been used to design a 3D-ordered porous macrostructure of the sensor. The Schwarz structure has been found to be capable of producing the best piezoresistive properties of the SWCNTs/TPU composite sensor with a gauge factor (GF) much higher than that for the Gyroid- and Diamond-structures. This phenomenon is well understood by the relationship between the piezoresistive sensitivity and the localized strain distribution revealed by Finite Element Modeling.},

@article{Yuan2018,
abstract = {Additive manufacturing such as selective laser sintering (SLS) offers the strategies to create 3D complex components with desirable mechanical, electrical and thermal properties using the composite powders as feeding materials. This work proposes a new fabrication approach to preparing carbon nanotube (CNT) composite powders and utilizes them for SLS process. As compared with the hot-compression process, the SLS process could offer an effective method to fabricate the CNT/Polymer composite with electrically conductive segregated structures. At a small loading range of CNTs (<1 wt%), the laser-sintered composites exhibit significant improvements in the electrical conductivity up to anti-static and conductive range qualifying the applications in automobile and aerospace. However, the enhancement in thermal conductivity of laser-sintered composites is not comparable with that of hot-compressed ones. The process-structure-property relationships are further investigated to study the different processes induced microstructures and the underlying mechanism of thermal and electrical performances.},

@article{Li2017,
abstract = {Selective laser sintering (SLS), which can directly turn 3D models into real objects, is employed to prepare the flexible thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) conductor using self-made carbon nanotubes (CNTs) wrapped TPU powders. The SLS printing, as a shear-free and free-flowing processing without compacting, provides a unique approach to construct conductive segregated networks of CNTs in the polymer matrix. The electrical conductivity for the SLS processed TPU/CNTs composite has a lower percolation threshold of 0.2 wt% and reaches ≈10−1 S m−1 at 1 wt% CNTs content, which is seven orders of magnitude higher than that of conventional injection-molded TPU/CNTs composites at the same CNTs content. The 3D printed TPU/CNTs specimen can maintain good flexibility and durability, even after repeated bending for 1000 cycles, the electrical resistance can keep at a nearly constant value. The flexible conductive TPU/CNTs composite with complicated structures and shapes like porous piezoresistors can be easily obtained by this approach.},

@article{Shen2023,
abstract = {The main research goal of high-performance conductive polymer composites is to improve electrical conductivity and reduce the percolation threshold. Designing an effective conductive network is one of the fundamental ways to improve the conductivity. In this study, polypropylene composite powders coated with carbon black (CB) and graphene nanosheets (GNSs) were prepared by a combination of ultrasonic dispersion and liquid-phase deposition, and sintered using a selective laser sintering process to prepare polypropylene composites with three-dimensional separated conductive networks. The synergistic effect of binary compound fillers of CB and GNSs was utilized to further improve the electrical conductivity of the composites. When the filler loading was 2% and the ratio of CB to graphene was 7:3, the electrical conductivity of the polypropylene composite was 1.315 × 10−3 S/m, which was eight orders of magnitude higher than that of pure polypropylene. In addition, the tensile strength and elongation at break of CB/GNSs/PP composites were improved by 36.4% and 20.77% with excellent mechanical properties. The effects of fillers on the SLS process, thermal stability, melting, and crystallization behavior of the composites were investigated.
