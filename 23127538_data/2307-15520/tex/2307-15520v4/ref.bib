ABSTRACT = {Noble transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) such as PtS2 and PtSe2 show significant potential in a wide range of optoelectronic and photonic applications. Noble TMDCs, unlike standard TMDCs such as MoS2 and WS2, operate in the ultrawide spectral range from ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths; however, their properties remain largely unexplored. Here, we measured the broadband (245&ndash;3300 nm) optical constants of ultrathin PtS2 and PtSe2 films to eliminate this gap and provide a foundation for optoelectronic device simulation. We discovered their broadband absorption and high refractive index both theoretically and experimentally. Based on first-principle calculations, we also predicted their giant out-of-plane optical anisotropy for monocrystals. As a practical illustration of the obtained optical properties, we demonstrated surface plasmon resonance biosensors with PtS2 or PtSe2 functional layers, which dramatically improves sensor sensitivity by 60 and 30\%, respectively.},

abstract = {PtSe2 is an emerging layered two-dimensional material of applied interest. Its monolayer shows promising properties for applications in electronic devices, while the bandgap of a multilayer PtSe2 film can be tuned via changing its thickness. In this work the bilayer PtSe2 thin films are investigated as an example of structural engineering with first-principles calculations. Various van der Waals corrections schemes are firstly discussed, and the optB86b scheme shows a better description of the semiconductor–metal transition for PtSe2 films. Six bilayer PtSe2 thin films in different stacking modes are constructed in order to structurally tune the electronic and transport properties. The bandgap can be effectively broadened with the structural engineering for wider potential applications. The carrier mobility, dynamical stability and Raman spectra are also calculated and discussed.}

abstract = {Thin films of noble-metal-based transition metal dichalcogenides, such as PtSe2, have attracted increasing attention due to their interesting layer-number dependent properties and application potential. While it is difficult to cleave bulk crystals down to mono- and few-layers, a range of growth techniques have been established producing material of varying quality and layer number. However, to date, no reliable high-throughput characterization to assess layer number exists. Here, we use top-down liquid phase exfoliation (LPE) coupled with centrifugation to produce PtSe2 nanosheets of varying sizes and thicknesses with a low degree of basal plane defectiveness. Measurement of the dimensions by statistical atomic force microscopy allows us to quantitatively link information contained in optical spectra to the dimensions. For LPE nanosheets we establish metrics for lateral size and layer number based on extinction spectroscopy. Further, we compare the Raman spectroscopic response of LPE nanosheets with micromechanically exfoliated PtSe2, as well as thin films produced by a range of bottom up techniques. We demonstrate that the Eg 1 peak position and the intensity ratio of the Eg 1/A1g 1 peaks can serve as a robust metric for layer number across all sample types.This will be of importance in future benchmarking of PtSe2 films.}

abstract = {Abstract Two-dimensional (2D) materials have attracted increasing attention for their outstanding structural and electrical properties. However, for mass-production of field effect transistors (FETs) and potential applications in integrated circuits, large-area and uniform 2D thin films with high mobility, large on-off ratio, and desired polarity are needed to synthesize firstly. Here, a transfer-free growth method for platinum diselenide (PtSe2) films has been developed. The PtSe2 films have been synthesized with various thicknesses in centimeter-sized scale. Typical FET made from a few layer PtSe2 show p-type unipolar, with a high field-effect hole mobility of 6.2 cm2 V−1 s−1 and an on-off ratio of 5 × 103. The versatile semimetal-unipolar-ambipolar transition in synthesized PtSe2 films is also firstly observed as the thickness thinning. This work realizes the large-scale preparation of PtSe2 with prominent electrical properties and provides a new strategy for polarity's modulation.},

abstract={Two-dimensional materials provide extraordinary opportunities for exploring phenomena arising in atomically thin crystals. Beginning with the first isolation of graphene, mechanical exfoliation has been a key to provide high-quality two-dimensional materials, but despite improvements it is still limited in yield, lateral size and contamination. Here we introduce a contamination-free, one-step and universal Au-assisted mechanical exfoliation method and demonstrate its effectiveness by isolating 40 types of single-crystalline monolayers, including elemental two-dimensional crystals, metal-dichalcogenides, magnets and superconductors. Most of them are of millimeter-size and high-quality, as shown by transfer-free measurements of electron microscopy, photo spectroscopies and electrical transport. Large suspended two-dimensional crystals and heterojunctions were also prepared with high-yield. Enhanced adhesion between the crystals and the substrates enables such efficient exfoliation, for which we identify a gold-assisted exfoliation method that underpins a universal route for producing large-area monolayers and thus supports studies of fundamental properties and potential application of two-dimensional materials.},

Two-dimensional materials from layered van der Waals (vdW) crystals hold great promise for electronic, optoelectronic, and quantum devices, but technological implementation will be hampered by the lack of high-throughput techniques for exfoliating single-crystal monolayers with sufficient size and high quality. Here, we report a facile method to disassemble vdW single crystals layer by layer into monolayers with near-unity yield and with dimensions limited only by bulk crystal sizes. The macroscopic monolayers are comparable in quality to microscopic monolayers from conventional Scotch tape exfoliation. The monolayers can be assembled into macroscopic artificial structures, including transition metal dichalcogenide multilayers with broken inversion symmetry and substantially enhanced nonlinear optical response. This approach takes us one step closer to mass production of macroscopic monolayers and bulk-like artificial materials with controllable properties.}}

abstract = {Understanding the evolution mechanisms of interlayer stacking structures, particularly at the atomic scale, is of great significance for modulating the physical properties and realizing the full potential of 2D materials in electronics and quantum information applications. Herein, by performing in situ experiments using aberration corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, the evolution of diverse interlayer stacking sequences (from 3R to N, N to 3R and N(3R) to AB′-stacked) in bilayer PtSe2 are directly observed. Furthermore, the interlayer rotational angles are tuned (e.g. 13.3° to 9.4°, 16.8° to 11° and 16.1° to 6°) in situ at real time in bilayer PtSe2. Density functional theory calculations reveal a small energy barrier (&lt;0.2 eV per formula unit) for the kinetic evolution of interlayer structures. The illumination electron beam, while being as an atomic-scale probe for imaging, transfers enough energy initiating the transition. The bilayer PtSe2 has show the rich stacking and twisted structures which may create novel physical phenomena. These findings shed new light on the diversity of structural properties of bilayer PtSe2, which may be valuable for constituting a step further toward their potential uses for next generation of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides-based device applications.}

Although narrow bandgap semiconductors, such as Mercury Cadmium Telluride and Indium Antimonide, and quantum superlattices based on inter-subband transitions in wide bandgap semiconductors, have been employed for mid-infrared applications, it remains a daunting challenge to search for other materials that possess suitable bandgaps in this wavelength range. Here, we demonstrate experimentally for the first time that two-dimensional (2D) atomically thin PtSe2 has a variable bandgap in the mid-infrared via layer and defect engineering. Here, we show that bilayer PtSe2 combined with defects modulation possesses strong light absorption in the mid-infrared region, and we realize a mid-infrared photoconductive detector operating in a broadband mid-infrared range. Our results pave the way for atomically thin 2D noble metal dichalcogenides to be employed in high-performance mid-infrared optoelectronic devices.},

abstract={Platinum-based transition metal dichalcogenides have been gaining renewed interest because of the development of a new method to synthesize thin film structures. Here, using first-principles calculation, we explore the electronic properties of PtX2 (X{\thinspace}={\thinspace}S, Se, and Te) with respect to film thickness. For bulk and layered structures (1 to 10 layers), octahedral 1T is the most stable. Surprisingly, we also find that the 3R structure has comparable stability relative to the 1T, implying possible synthesis of 3R. For a bulk 1T structure, PtS2 is semiconducting with an indirect band gap of 0.25{\thinspace}eV, while PtSe2 and PtTe2 are both semi-metallic. Still, all their corresponding monolayers exhibit an indirect semiconducting phase with band gaps of 1.68, 1.18, and 0.40{\thinspace}eV for PtS2, PtSe2, and PtTe2, respectively. For the band properties, we observe that all these materials manifest decreasing/closing of indirect band gap with increasing thickness, a consequence of quantum confinement and interlayer interaction. Moreover, we discover that controlling the thickness and applying strain can manipulate van Hove singularity resulting to high density of states at the maximum valence band. Our results exhibit the sensitivity and tunability of electronic properties of PtX2, paving a new path for future potential applications.},

By applying a hBN-assisted, contamination free, dry transfer process for CVD graphene, high-quality heterostructures with low doping densities and low strain variations are assembled. The Raman spectra of these pristine heterostructures are sensitive to substrate-induced doping and strain variations and are thus used to probe the suitability of the substrate material for potential high-quality graphene devices.

abstract={Confocal Raman spectroscopy has emerged as a major, versatile workhorse for the non-invasive characterization of graphene. Although it is successfully used to determine the number of layers, the quality of edges, and the effects of strain, doping and disorder, the nature of the experimentally observed broadening of the most prominent Raman 2D line has remained unclear. Here we show that the observed 2D line width contains valuable information on strain variations in graphene on length scales far below the laser spot size, that is, on the nanometre-scale. This finding is highly relevant as it has been shown recently that such nanometre-scaled strain variations limit the carrier mobility in high-quality graphene devices. Consequently, the 2D line width is a good and easily accessible quantity for classifying the crystalline quality, nanometre-scale flatness as well as local electronic properties of graphene, all important for future scientific and industrial applications.},

Hall measurements performed on epitaxial ZnO/PtSe2 with five monolayers of PtSe2 show a clear semiconducting behaviour and a high mobility in excess of 200 cm2 V−1 s−1 at room temperature and up to 447 cm2 V−1 s−1 at low temperature.}

In particular, sulfides and selenides of molybdenum (Mo) and tungsten (W) have attracted interest as they possess a band gap, which is important for integration into electronic device structures. However, the low throughput synthesis of high quality TMD thin films has thus far hindered the development of devices, and so a scalable method is required to fully exploit their exceptional properties. Within this work a facile route to the manufacture of devices from MoS2 and WS2, grown by vapour phase sulfurisation of pre-deposited metal layers, is presented. Highly homogenous TMD films are produced over large areas. Fine control over TMD film thickness, down to a few layers, is achieved by modifying the thickness of the pre-deposited metal layer. The films are characterised by Raman spectroscopy, electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The thinnest films exhibit photoluminescence, as predicted for monolayer MoS2 films, due to confinement in two dimensions. By using shadow mask lithography, films with well-defined geometries were produced and subsequently integrated with standard microprocessing process flows and electrically characterised. In this way, MoS2 based sensors were produced, displaying sensitivity to NH3 down to 400ppb. Our device manufacture is versatile, and is adaptable for future nanoscale (opto-) electronic devices as it is reproducible, cost effective and scalable up to wafer scale.}

The optimum deposition temperature for smooth (111)-oriented, single crystal Pt layers was found to be 300 to 600 °C. A minimal nominal film thickness for full Pt film coverage was determined to be about 3 ML. Optimization of the subsequent reaction with selenium using 3-nm-thick Pt layers to form PtSe2 was found most efficient at 200 °C. Crystalline PtSe2 layers with smooth surfaces were formed, but temperature was too low to completely convert the entire 3-nm-thick Pt film. Thinner, uncoalesced Pt films were nearly fully converted into PtSe2 at 200 °C, but revealed a reduced degree of crystallinity, which was significantly improved by a post-selenization anneal at 400 °C under a Se flux, providing a bottom-up synthesis strategy for PtSe2 fabrication in the monolayer limit.}

abstract = {We studied helicity-resolved Raman scattering in PtSe2 flakes with different thicknesses. The peak amplitude of helicity-switched Raman scattering is significantly larger than that of helicity-conserved scattering for the in-plane E  g  mode, consistent with the Raman tensor analyses and conservation law of angular momentum. The peak amplitude of the helicity-switched E  g  mode is larger for the thinner flakes. In addition, we find Raman peaks near the energy levels of IR-active E  u  and A 2u  modes, only for monolayer and a few-layers-thick flakes. Interestingly, these peaks manifest themselves only for helicity-switched Raman scattering; they are nearly absent for helicity-conserved scattering.}

journal = {2D Materials},
abstract = {Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently gained a strong interest as a strategic component in engineering van der Waals heterostructures built with 2D crystals such as graphene. This work reports micro-Raman measurements on hBN flakes made of a few atomic layers, prepared by mechanical exfoliation. The temperature dependence of the Raman scattering in hBN is investigated first such as to define appropriate measurements conditions suitable for thin layers avoiding undesirable heating induced effects. We further focus on the low frequency Raman mode corresponding to the rigid shearing oscillation between adjacent layers, found to be equal to 52.5 cm−1 in bulk hBN. For hBN sheets with thicknesses below typically 4 nm, the frequency of this mode presents discrete values, which are found to decrease down to 46.0(5) cm−1 for a three-layer hBN, in good agreement with the linear-chain model. This makes Raman spectroscopy a relevant tool to quantitatively determine in a non destructive way the number of layers in ultra thin hBN sheets, below 8 L, prior to their integration in van der Waals heterostructures.}
