We survey the landscape of human operator modeling ranging from the early cognitive models 
developed in artificial intelligence to more recent 
formal task models developed for model-checking of human machine interactions.   
We review human performance modeling and human factors studies in
the context of aviation, and models of how the pilot interacts with automation in the cockpit. 
The purpose of the survey is to assess the applicability of available 
state-of-the-art models of the human operators for the design, verification and validation of future safety-critical
aviation systems that exhibit higher-level of autonomy, but still require human operators in the loop.  
These systems include the single-pilot aircraft and NextGen air traffic management. 
We discuss the gaps in existing models and propose future research to address them.
