  "abstract": "We construct fermionic conformal field theories (CFTs) whose spectra are characterized by quantum stabilizer codes. We exploit our construction to search for fermionic CFTs with supersymmetry by focusing on quantum stabilizer codes of the Calderbank-Shor-Steane type, and derive simple criteria for the theories to be supersymmetric. We provide several examples of fermionic CFTs that meet the criteria, and find quantum codes that realize $\\mathcal{N} =4$ supersymmetry. Our work constitutes a new application of quantum codes and paves the way for the methodical search for supersymmetric CFTs.",
