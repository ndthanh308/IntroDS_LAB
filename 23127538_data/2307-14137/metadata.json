  "abstract": "The control of mortar rheology is of paramount importance in the design of systems and structures in 3D printing concrete by extrusion. This is particularly sensitive for two-component (2K) processes that use an accelerator to switch the printed mortar very quickly from a liquid behavior to a sufficiently solid behavior to be able to be printed. It is necessary to set up simple and effective tests within a precise methodological framework to qualify materials evolving so quickly in an industrial context. It is obvious that inline solutions, that is to say, post-printing solutions, will be more desirable than benchtop-type solutions reproducing the printing conditions as well as possible, but imperfectly. After some main key points about measuring the structuration of mortars, we propose an original inline test using a pocket shear vane tester. The protocols are precisely described and the simplicity and quality of the results are demonstrated.",
