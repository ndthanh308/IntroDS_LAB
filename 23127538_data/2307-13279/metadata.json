  "abstract": "Beam splitters are not-free operations with regard to quantum coherence. As a consequence, they can create coherence from both coherent and incoherent states. We investigate the increase in coherence produced by cascades of beam splitters. To this end, we construct two different configurations and analyze different sequences of input states.",
