  abstract = {As sustainability is one of the main pillars in developing future cities, adopting natural ventilation whenever possible is one way to reduce energy consumption, thus indirectly reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Lately, ventilated acoustic metamaterials have started to receive more research attention because of how they can provide both ventilation and noise control. Motivated by this research attention, we present this timely systematic review of emerging ventilated acoustic metamaterials for noise control. By limiting the review to a five-year coverage (2018\textendash 2023), three kinds of ventilated acoustic metamaterials were identified\textemdash metamufflers, metapanels, and metacages. Based on the studies included in this review, we discuss the present challenges of metacages. More research efforts are still needed to see real-world applications of metacages as a novel ventilated noise control measure in the future.},

The field is driven by the desire to control acoustic wave propagation using compact devices and is governed by fundamental and physical principles that provide the design rules and the functionality of a wave. Acoustic metasurfaces have added value and unusual functionalities compared with their predecessor in materials science, namely, acoustic metamaterials. These rationally designed 2D materials of subwavelength thickness provide a new route for sound wave manipulation. In this Review, we delineate the fundamental physics of metasurfaces, describe their different concepts and design strategies, and discuss their functionalities for controllable reflection, transmission and extraordinary absorption. In particular, we outline the main designs of acoustic metasurfaces, including those based on coiling-up space, Helmholtz-resonator-like and membrane-type structures, and discuss their applications, such as beam focusing, asymmetrical transmission and self-bending beams. We conclude with an outlook of the future directions in this emerging field.},

Within this context, particular attention has been paid to the optimization of the amplitudes and center frequencies of selected stop and pass bands inside the Floquet\textendash Bloch spectra of the acoustic metamaterials featured by a chiral or antichiral microstructure. Novel functional applications of such research are expected in the optimal parametric design of smart tunable mechanical filters and directional waveguides. The present paper deals with the maximization of the amplitude of low-frequency band gaps, by proposing suitable numerical techniques to solve the associated optimization problems. Specifically, the feasibility and effectiveness of Radial Basis Function networks and Quasi-Monte Carlo methods for the interpolation of the objective functions of such optimization problems are discussed, and their numerical application to a specific acoustic metamaterial with tetrachiral microstructure is presented. The discussion is motivated theoretically by the high computational effort often needed for an exact evaluation of the objective functions arising in band gap optimization problems, when iterative algorithms are used for their approximate solution. By replacing such functions with suitable surrogate objective functions constructed applying machine-learning techniques, well-performing suboptimal solutions can be obtained with a smaller computational effort. Numerical results demonstrate the effective potential of the proposed approach. Current directions of research involving the use of additional machine-learning techniques are also presented.},

While some applications utilise the resonant nature of surface polaritons, others require broadband characteristics. We demonstrate unidirectional and broadband plasmonic antennas with large acceptance angles based on chirped plasmonic gratings. Near-field optical measurements have been used to visualise the excitation of surface plasmon polaritons by such aperiodic structures. These weakly aperiodic plasmonic crystals allow the formation of a trapped rainbow-type effect in a two-dimensional geometry as surface polaritons of different frequencies are coherently excited in different locations over the plasmonic structure. Both the crystal's finite size and the finite lifetime of plasmonic states are crucial for the generation of broadband surface plasmon polaritons. This approach presents new opportunities for building unidirectional, broadband and broad-angle plasmonic couplers for sensing purposes, information processing, photovoltaic applications and shaping and manipulating ultrashort optical pulses.},

The dispersion of the system is spatially dependent and allows the rainbow trapping inside the structure. Nonlinearity is used to activate the self-demodulation effect, which is enhanced due to the particular dispersion characteristics of the system. The performed numerical study reveals an efficient generation of the demodulated wave, up to 15\% in terms of the pressure amplitude, as well as strong attenuation for undesired frequency components above the cut-off frequency. The obtained energy rectification ratio is in the order of 104 for the whole range of amplitudes employed in this work, indicating the robustness of the asymmetry and non-reciprocity of the proposed device for a wide operational range.}

The technique is formulated for both acoustic waves and linear liquid surface waves. Some interesting conceptual devices can be designed for manipulating acoustic waves. For example, we can design acoustic cloaks that make an object invisible to acoustic waves, and the cloak can either encompass or lie outside the object to be concealed. Transformation acoustics, as an analog of transformation optics, can go beyond invisibility cloaking. As an illustration for manipulating linear liquid surface waves, we show that a liquid wave rotator can be designed and fabricated to rotate the wave front. The acoustic transformation media require acoustic materials which are anisotropic and inhomogeneous. Such materials are difficult to find in nature. However, composite materials with embedded sub-wavelength resonators can in principle be made and such `acoustic metamaterials' can exhibit nearly arbitrary values of effective density and modulus tensors to satisfy the demanding material requirements in transformation acoustics. We introduce resonant sonic materials and Helmholtz resonators as examples of acoustic metamaterials that exhibit resonant behaviour in effective density and effective modulus.},

This expression allows us to devise a method for designing ACPCs with tailored reflectance spectra and obtain an estimate for the minimal number of layers required to exceed a given reflectance threshold. Comparison against the number of layers found in ACPCs throughout nature gives a quantitative measure of the optimality of chirped biological reflectors. Together, these results elucidate the design of chirped reflectors in nature and their possible application to future optical technologies.},

This paper outlines a deep learning-based approach to extend current knowledge of metamaterial design in acoustics. We develop a design method by using conditional generative adversarial networks. The generative network proposes a cell candidate regarding a desired transmission behavior of the metamaterial. To validate our method, numerical simulations with the finite element method are performed. Our study reveals considerable insight into design strategies for sound insulation tasks.

Recent advent in origami technology offers new possibilities and smart solutions to solve this bottlenecking problem. In this paper, we propose a novel modular-origami-based reconfigurable silencing window that achieves balanced noise mitigation and air ventilation while ensuring flexible tunability. Specifically, the balance between the two competing functions originates from the unique `tile\textemdash void' structure of the modular origami, and the tunability is a result of the single-degree-of-freedom folding mechanism. Based on a comprehensive understanding of the correlations between the design variables (including origami geometry, internal partition forms, and folding angles) and the acoustic characteristics of the window, on-demand sound attenuation for a specific target frequency band can be achieved via optimization. Broadband noise reduction can be obtained through cascading multiple origami layers, whose design can be conceived by an intuitive spectral superposition principle. Finally, we demonstrate through numerical simulations that for different working scenarios, balanced sound attenuation and air ventilation can be achieved by simply folding the origami window. This conceptual design, alongside the reported findings, provides new ideas for the design of modular acoustic devices and contributes to addressing the noise reduction and ventilation needs for urban buildings as well as industrial installations.},

Extensive work in the field of acoustic metamaterials has led to various ventilated structures which, however, are usually demonstrated for rather narrow regions of the audible spectrum. In this work, the idea of metamaterial-based systems is further extended, developing the concept of a metahouse chamber representing a ventilated structure for multiple band noise insulation. Broad stop-bands originate from strong coupling between pairs of Helmholtz resonators constituting the structure. The averaged transmission -18.6 dB are demonstrated numerically and experimentally within the spectral range from 1500 to 16 500 Hz. The sparseness of the structure together with the possibility to use optically transparent materials suggest that the chamber may be also characterized by partial optical transparency depending on the mutual position of structural elements.

  abstract = {A review of the development of acoustic metamaterials, guided by their physical characteristics and novel functionalities. Within a time span of 15 years, acoustic metamaterials have emerged from academic curiosity to become an active field driven by scientific discoveries and diverse application potentials. This review traces the development of acoustic metamaterials from the initial findings of mass density and bulk modulus frequency dispersions in locally resonant structures to the diverse functionalities afforded by the perspective of negative constitutive parameter values, and their implications for acoustic wave behaviors. We survey the more recent developments, which include compact phase manipulation structures, superabsorption, and actively controllable metamaterials as well as the new directions on acoustic wave transport in moving fluid, elastic, and mechanical metamaterials, graphene-inspired metamaterials, and structures whose characteristics are best delineated by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Many of the novel acoustic metamaterial structures have transcended the original definition of metamaterials as arising from the collective manifestations of constituent resonating units, but they continue to extend wave manipulation functionalities beyond those found in nature.}

  abstract = {The effective operation of certain electronic, medical, industrial, and testing equipment relies on high-quality focusing and imaging capability, which also plays a vital role in the field of wave physics. Therefore, continuously improving the resolution capacity is essential. However, in a homogeneous medium dominated by the diffraction limit, the best resolution for wave focusing and imaging could only reach half the wavelength corresponding to the lowest operating frequency, significantly hindering the relevant application value. The development of phononic crystals (PCs) and acoustic metamaterials (AMMs) has realized sub-wavelength focusing and super-resolution imaging and attracted increasing research attention in physics, mechanics, engineering, and biomedical science. This Tutorial explained the basic principles and traditional methods of acoustic focusing and imaging. Then, the implementation principles and related research progress of sub-wavelength focusing and super-resolution imaging based on artificial acoustic devices, including but not limited to PCs and AMMs, were systematically discussed. Moreover, a method was introduced to realize sub-wavelength or sub-diffraction focusing by integrating these artificial devices into the time-reversal procedure. Finally, the potential development trends and practical application prospects were presented.}

  abstract = {The advancement in electromagnetic metamaterials, which commenced three decades ago, experienced a rapid transformation into acoustic and elastic systems in the forms of phononic crystals and acoustic/elastic metamaterials. Since its early discovery, numerous wave phenomena alongside the possible engineering applications have been highlighted. The existing and emerging fields of metamaterials are far more extensive, ranging from optics to acoustic, and all the way to the elastic systems. Numerous fantastic dynamic properties in optics and acoustic/elastic systems have been reported to date, which cannot be found in naturally occurring materials. The present review tends to discuss the historical context, current progresses and possible future outcomes of metamaterials. The fascinating phenomena observed in optics/electromagnetic metamaterials have been explained and linked with acoustic and elastic counterparts. The idea of perfect lens that is governed by negative permittivity and negative permeability via left-handed materials with negative refractive index properties and the transformation optics for invisibility cloaks and optical rainbow effect alongside the hyperbolic metamaterials are reviewed and discussed. Furthermore, the associated transformation into acoustic and elastic focusing effects via graded index metamaterials, acoustic/elastic invisibility cloaks, transformational acoustics, and seismology and metawedges resembling optical rainbow effects and the likes are explained. The present state of the art has been examined and the physics involved in the governing of those peculiar wave mechanisms has been highlighted. Starting from photonic crystals, phononic crystals and acoustic metamaterials, the present state of the art research~in some subfields of acoustic metamaterials has been outlined, such as metasurfaces, topological phononic crystals and seismic metamaterials, the three exciting and emerging research topics. The substantial challenges involved in these realms are characterised and the possible future outcome is further evaluated.

According to the WHO, {$\geq$}1.6 million healthy life-years are lost annually from traffic-related noise in Western Europe. Traffic noise at night causes fragmentation and shortening of sleep, elevation of stress hormone levels, and increased oxidative stress in the vasculature and the brain. These factors can promote vascular dysfunction, inflammation and hypertension, thereby elevating the risk of cardiovascular disease. In this Review, we focus on the indirect, non-auditory cardiovascular health effects of transportation noise. We provide an updated overview of epidemiological research on the effects of transportation noise on cardiovascular risk factors and disease, discuss the mechanistic insights from the latest clinical and experimental studies, and propose new risk markers to address noise-induced cardiovascular effects in the general population. We also explain, in detail, the potential effects of noise on alterations of gene networks, epigenetic pathways, gut microbiota, circadian rhythm, signal transduction along the neuronal\textendash cardiovascular axis, oxidative stress, inflammation and metabolism. Lastly, we describe current and future noise-mitigation strategies and evaluate the status of the existing evidence on noise as a cardiovascular risk factor.},

The independent variables of these methods are specific flow resistivity and material thickness. However, the existing literature fails to provide proper knowledge regarding the prediction accuracy of these methods. The aim of this study was to determine the prediction accuracy of the sound absorption coefficient of these seven published impedance prediction methods. The study focused on normal sound incidence. Accuracy was determined by comparing the predicted and the measured absorption coefficients of 82 mineral wool configurations. The transfer matrix method was used to calculate the absorption coefficient within 100 and 3150Hz. Allard and Champoux's method reached the best prediction accuracy. A simplification of this method was developed to enable fast implementation. The results are very useful for researchers and developers who employ impedance prediction methods.},

The reflectance bandwidth can be broadened by employing chirped structures where the optical thicknesses of the respective layers are changed arithmetically. On the other hand, for chirped Bragg reflectors, resonant reflection drops appeared at some wavelengths. These drops can be corrected by inserting periodic alternating layers. The reflectance band of 80\% reflectivity is 2.7 times as wide as that of the conventional reflector of the periodic sequence in the case of 66 layer stack.}

Studies of occupational and environmental noise exposure suggest an association with hypertension, whereas community studies show only weak relationships between noise and cardiovascular disease. Aircraft and road traffic noise exposure are associated with psychological symptoms but not with clinically defined psychiatric disorder. In both industrial studies and community studies, noise exposure is related to raised catecholamine secretion. In children, chronic aircraft noise exposure impairs reading comprehension and long-term memory and may be associated with raised blood pressure.

Methods We update a prior review with recent publications (PROSPERO CRD42019151923). The strength of evidence for associations was assessed using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations) framework. We also conducted random-effects meta-analyses where suitable. Results 16 studies were identified and reviewed in tandem with 32 studies previously reviewed by Clark \& Paunovic (2018). A meta-analysis from 3 studies found that reading comprehension scores in quiet classrooms were 0.80 (95\% confidence interval: 0.40; 1.20) points higher than children in noisier classrooms. Meta-analysis of the impact of 1~dB (dB) increase in environmental noise on reading and language abilities gave a pooled beta coefficient of -0.11(95\% confidence interval: -0.32; 0.10). A meta-analysis of Odds Ratios (OR) from 3 studies found higher odds of cognitive impairment in people aged 45~+~with higher residential noise exposure (OR 1.40, 95\% CI: 1.18;1.61). After qualitative synthesis of remaining studies, there was high quality evidence for an association between environmental noise and cognitive impairment in middle-to-older adults, moderate quality evidence for an association between aircraft noise and reading and language in children, and moderate quality evidence against an association between aircraft noise and executive functioning in children. Generally the literature was supportive for other cognitive outcomes, but with low or very low-quality evidence. Discussion The evidence so far suggests that noise exposure is associated with cognition, but more good quality research using standardised methodology is required to corroborate these results and to allow for precise risk estimation by larger meta-analyses. There is also a need for more research with older teenagers and young-to-middle aged adults, on the synergistic effects of noise and air pollution, and in Africa, Central and South America, South Asia and Australasia.},

  abstract = {The rainbow trapping effect has been demonstrated in electromagnetic and acoustic waves. In this study, rainbow trapping of ultrasonic guided waves is achieved in chirped phononic crystal plates that spatially modulate the dispersion, group velocity, and stopband. The rainbow trapping is related to the progressively slowing group velocity, and the extremely low group velocity near the lower boundary of a stopband that gradually varies in chirped phononic crystal plates. As guided waves propagate along the phononic crystal plate, waves gradually slow down and finally stop forward propagating. The energy of guided waves is concentrated at the low velocity region near the stopband. Moreover, the guided wave energy of different frequencies is concentrated at different locations, which manifests as rainbow guided waves. We believe implementing the rainbow trapping will open new paradigms for guiding and focusing of guided waves. Moreover, the rainbow guided waves with energy concentration and spatial separation of frequencies may have potential applications in nondestructive evaluation, spatial wave filtering, energy harvesting, and acoustofluidics.},

The mechanical ventilation systems are mainly used in the summer for many difficulties to face very hot temperatures. One of the biggest problems considered if every residential unit is equipped with a mechanical ventilation system is the generation of noise by the rotating blades of the fan for refrigeration. This paper discusses the applications of metamaterials to create attenuation filters to be installed inside the encases of the mechanical ventilation systems in order to obtain sound attenuation. A three-dimensional reticular structure made with spheres has been studied in different configurations related to the numbers of layers employed. The sound attenuations were measured at some specific octaves, depending on the particular configurations. In general, the sound attenuation peaks have been measured between 4 kHz and 8 kHz; this is expected to mitigate the tonal noise component typical of fans based on different variables that compose the whole system (e.g., fan diameter, number of blades, fan speed). However, the outcomes shall be considered in terms of laboratory conditions since material properties of the enclosure and potential polarization effects due to reflection of sound waves at the boundaries may occur.},

Basic and applied research on PnCs spans the entire phononic spectrum, from seismic waves and audible sound to gigahertz phononics for telecommunications and thermal transport in the terahertz range. Here, we review the progress and applications of PnCs across their spectrum, and we offer some perspectives in view of the growing demand for vibrational isolation, fast signal processing, and miniaturization of devices. Current research on macroscopic low-frequency PnCs offers complete solutions from design and optimization to construction and characterization, e.g., sound insulators, seismic shields, and ultrasonic imaging devices. Hypersonic PnCs made of novel low-dimensional nanomaterials can be used to develop smaller microelectromechanical systems and faster wireless networks. The operational frequency, compactness, and efficiency of wireless communications can also increase using principles of optomechanics. In the terahertz range, PnCs can be used for efficient heat removal from electronic devices and for novel thermoelectrics. Finally, the introduction of topology in condensed matter physics has provided revolutionary designs of macroscopic sub-gigahertz PnCs, which can now be transferred to the gigahertz range with advanced nanofabrication techniques and momentum-resolved spectroscopy of acoustic phonons.},

Reflection spectra are numerically calculated and analyzed by making use of the transfer matrix method in a stratified medium. The results show that such a chirped structure has a weak effect on the fundamental bandgap, but the higher order bandgaps are strongly affected. The second bandgap is apparently broadened due to the shift in its lower band edge. Results of spectra for both TE and TM waves at different incident angles are also given and discussed.}

  abstract = {Metamaterials, as artificially structured materials composed of subwavelength arrays of resonant unit cells, can exhibit exotic properties beyond those accessible to natural materials. They were initially proposed for challenging fundamental laws and demonstrating negative refraction in the microwave regime, and subsequently exploited as a versatile platform to manipulate electromagnetic waves throughout the spectrum via their extreme scalability. Over the past decade, research into metamaterials has been extended to a search for real-world applications, leading to the concept of metadevices, defined as metamaterial-based devices that can operate in an active manner. Due to their subwavelength scale, metamaterials present intriguing strategies for active tuning and provide flat, high-efficiency alternatives to conventional optical systems based on bulky components. In this topical review, we summarize the development of active metamaterials and metadevices ranging from microwave to visible wavelengths, including milestones as well as the state of the art. We survey tuning strategies based on mechanical reconfiguration and incorporation with active materials such as varactor diodes, semiconductors, liquid crystals, phase change materials, superconductors, and two-dimensional materials under various external stimuli, and discuss their fascinating advantages and potential challenges to be confronted. Finally, future prospects together with several emerging tuning strategies and materials are presented at the end.},

  abstract = {Noise reduction and other manipulation of sound waves has been a major concern in science and engineering. Here, we propose a ventilated soundproof acoustic metamaterial consisting of resonant cavities arranged around a central air passage. This metamaterial can accomplish strong sound insulation performance. The transmission loss is larger than 30 dB within a wide frequency range (625\textendash 1695 Hz) due to the prohibited band. More intriguingly, we discover that rotating the opening, somewhat like an acoustic switch, can directly control the sound transmission of the deaf band. This is particularly useful for opening a narrow but high transmission window at the frequency of interest, which provides a new degree of freedom for sound control. Through band structure analysis and effective parameter calculation, we discover the sound insulation mechanism of the ventilated metamaterial and reveal the underlying mechanism of the switchable narrow-band sound transmission. Beyond the 1D study, the proposed acoustic metamaterial is expanded to a 3D soundproof metacage. We find that the sound insulation performance and switchable sound transmission phenomena are still retained for the metacage. The results reported here may inspire more exploration of sound barriers and multifunctional applications, such as innovative building facades for noise reduction and logic components for acoustic circuits.},

Biomimetic, taking the shortcut of ``Learning from Nature'', transfers optimum designs in nature to technical applications. Following a recent tide of researches on optical structures in biology, optical biomimetic thrives and yields various bioinspired optical materials with advanced optical properties mediated by microstructures borrowed from nature. This review covers optical biomimetic materials integrated with typical structural design based on multilayer, helicoidal structure, moth eye, photonic crystal, ridge, irregular network, double-facet microlens and tunable optical structures that lead to advanced optical effects including broad-angle structural color, color-mixing, polarization, antireflection, iridescence, ultra-blackness, ultra-whiteness, light focusing and dynamic structural color. The mechanisms underlying these structure-related optical phenomena have been described and the realization of corresponding biomimetic optical materials mimicking the natural structures has been elucidated. We conclude by making a prospect on optical biomimetic materials.},

  abstract = {Despite their widespread use for performing advanced computational tasks, digital signal processors suffer from several restrictions, including low speed, high power consumption and complexity, caused by costly analogue-to-digital converters. For this reason, there has recently been a surge of interest in performing wave-based analogue computations that avoid analogue-to-digital conversion and allow massively parallel operation. In particular, novel schemes for wave-based analogue computing have been proposed based on artificially engineered photonic structures, that is, metamaterials. Such kinds of computing systems, referred to as computational metamaterials, can be as fast as the speed of light and as small as its wavelength, yet, impart complex mathematical operations on an incoming wave packet or even provide solutions to integro-differential equations. These much-sought features promise to enable a new generation of ultra-fast, compact and efficient processing and computing hardware based on light-wave propagation. In this Review, we discuss recent advances in the field of computational metamaterials, surveying the state-of-the-art metastructures proposed to perform analogue computation. We further describe some of the most exciting applications suggested for these computing systems, including image processing, edge detection, equation solving and machine learning. Finally, we provide an outlook for the possible directions and the key problems for future research.},

  abstract = {Low noise constructions receive more and more attention in highly industrialized countries. Consequently, decrease of noise radiation challenges a growing community of engineers. One of the most efficient techniques for finding quiet structures consists in numerical optimization. Herein, we consider structural-acoustic optimization understood as an (iterative) minimum search of a specified objective (or cost) function by modifying certain design variables. Obviously, a coupled problem must be solved to evaluate the objective function. In this paper, we will start with a review of structural and acoustic analysis techniques using numerical methods like the finite- and/or the boundary-element method. This is followed by a survey of techniques for structural-acoustic coupling. We will then discuss objective functions. Often, the average sound pressure at one or a few points in a frequency interval accounts for the objective function for interior problems, wheareas the average sound power is mostly used for external problems. The analysis part will be completed by review of sensitivity analysis and special techniques. We will then discuss applications of structural-acoustic optimization. Starting with a review of related work in pure structural optimization and in pure acoustic optimization, we will categorize the problems of optimization in structural acoustics. A suitable distinction consists in academic and more applied examples. Academic examples iclude simple structures like beams, rectangular or circular plates and boxes; real industrial applications consider problems like that of a fuselage, bells, loudspeaker diaphragms and components of vehicle structures. Various different types of variables are used as design parameters. Quite often, locally defined plate or shell thickness or discrete point masses are chosen. Furthermore, all kinds of structural material parameters, beam cross sections, spring characteristics and shell geometry account for suitable design modifications. This is followed by a listing of constraints that have been applied. After that, we will discuss strategies of optimization. Starting with a formulation of the optimization problem we review aspects of multiobjective optimization, approximation concepts and optimization methods in general. In a final chapter, results are categorized and discussed. Very often, quite large decreases of noise radiation have been reported. However, even small gains should be highly appreciated in some cases of certain support conditions, complexity of simulation, model and large frequency ranges. Optimization outcomes are categorized with respect to objective functions, optimization methods, variables and groups of problems, the latter with particular focus on industrial applications. More specifically, a close-up look at vehicle panel shell geometry optimization is presented. Review of results is completed with a section on experimental validation of optimization gains. The conclusions bring together a number of open problems in the field.},

  abstract = {Acoustic metamaterials are structures with exotic acoustic properties, with promising applications in acoustic beam steering, focusing, impedance matching, absorption and isolation. Recent work has shown that the efficiency of many acoustic metamaterials can be enhanced by controlling an additional parameter known as Willis coupling, which is analogous to bianisotropy in electromagnetic metamaterials. The magnitude of Willis coupling in a passive acoustic meta-atom has been shown theoretically to have an upper limit, however the feasibility of reaching this limit has not been experimentally investigated. Here we introduce a meta-atom with Willis coupling which closely approaches this theoretical limit, that is much simpler and less prone to thermo-viscous losses than previously reported structures. We perform two-dimensional experiments to measure the strong Willis coupling, supported by numerical calculations. Our meta-atom geometry is readily modeled analytically, enabling the strength of Willis coupling and its peak frequency to be easily controlled.},

  abstract = {Acoustic exterior problems are in this paper solved numerically using the Astley-Leis infinite element method (IFEM). Normal modes can be determined thanks to the frequency independence of the system matrices. Convergence properties of the harmonic sound pressure solution as well as of normal mode eigenvalues are investigated for two-dimensional elliptical computational domains to estimate the essential requirements of accuracy. A relationship between the half-axis ratio of the ellipses and the eigenvalues is identified. By solving half-space problems, symmetry of the computational domains is utilized, which is shown for the first time for frequency-independent normal modes in exterior acoustics. This paper discusses applicability of the modes in the example of sonic crystals\textemdash periodic arrays of scatterers, in this context denoted as acoustic meta-atoms\textemdash that have recently attracted attention for their possible use as noise barriers. It can be shown that the sound-insulating effect of finite sonic crystals and individual meta-atoms in the free field can be related to normal modes in exterior acoustics. With the help of this approach, the absorption by Helmholtz resonators and due to a boundary admittance inside are studied. This work provides a new point of view and physical insights into the effects and underlying physics of sound insulation by finite sonic crystals and acoustic meta-atoms in free field. Although it is not the intention of this article to optimize the arrays, the method of normal modes in exterior acoustics is presented as an appropriate and novel tool for their dimensioning and design.},

  abstract = {Noise mitigation of stage machinery can be quite demanding and requires innovative solutions. In this work, an acoustic metamaterial capsule is proposed to reduce the noise emission of several stage machinery drive trains, while still allowing the ventilation required for cooling. The metamaterial capsule consists of c-shape meta-atoms, which have a simple structure that facilitates manufacturing. Two different metamaterial capsules are designed, simulated, manufactured, and experimentally validated that utilize an ultra-sparse and air-permeable reflective meta-grating. Both designs demonstrate transmission loss peaks that effectively suppress gear mesh noise or other narrow band noise sources. The ventilation by natural convection was numerically verified, and was shown to give adequate cooling, whereas a conventional sound capsule would lead to overheating. The noise spectra of three common stage machinery drive trains are numerically modelled, enabling one to design meta-gratings and determine their noise suppression performance. The results fulfill the stringent stage machinery noise limits, highlighting the benefit of using metamaterial capsules of simple c-shape structure.},
