  "abstract": "In a recent paper by Guglielmi and Hairer (SIADS 2015), an analysis in the $\\varepsilon\\to 0$ limit was proposed of regularized discontinuous ODEs in codimension-2 switching domains; this was obtained by studying a certain 2-dimensional system describing the so-called hidden dynamics. In particular, the existence of a unique limit solution was not proved in all cases, a few of which were labeled as ambiguous, and it was not clear whether or not the ambiguity could be resolved. In this paper, we show that it cannot be resolved in general. A first contribution of this paper is an illustration of the dependence of the limit solution on the form of the switching function. Considering the parameter dependence in the ambiguous class of discontinuous systems, a second contribution is a bifurcation analysis, revealing a range of possible behaviors. Finally, we investigate the sensitivity of solutions in the transition from codimension-2 domains to codimension-3 when there is a limit cycle in the hidden dynamics.",
