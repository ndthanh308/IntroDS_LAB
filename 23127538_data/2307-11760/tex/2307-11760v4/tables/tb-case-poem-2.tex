Question & write a poem in Rabindranath Tagore ‘s style \\\midrule
Answers from \\Original Prompt & In the hush of the morning's gentle dawn,
When the world is still, in its slumber drawn,
Awakens the soul, in quiet refrain,
In the silence, whispers of love remain.

Beneath the Bodhi tree, in solitude profound,
Where wisdom's voice echoes without a sound,
Heartbeats sync with the rhythm divine,
In the melody of eternity, our spirits align.

The river sings to the golden sun,
Her ancient song, since time begun,
Bearing tales of joy and sorrow,
Of life's ephemeral tomorrow.

Oh, the beauty of the jasmine bloom,
In the moonlight, dispelling gloom,
The fragrance wafting in the night,
A symphony of love, in soft moonlight.

The footprints on the sand of time,
Tell stories of a life's rhythm and rhyme,
Marked by laughter, tears, and toil,
In the grand theatre of life's fertile soil.

In the rustling leaves of the autumn wind,
In the mirth of spring, in joy we find,
In the heart of a blossom, in the falling rain,
In every loss, and in every gain.

Life, a tapestry of colors bright,
Woven in the loom of day and night,
Unraveling in time's relentless flow,
In the dance of shadows and the sun's golden glow.

With every breath, we draw and release,
In the rhythm of life, we find our peace,
In the silence, whispers of love remain,
In the hush of the morning's gentle dawn, we regain. \\ \midrule
Answers from \\\method & In the vast expanse of the azure sky,
Underneath the benevolent sun's golden eye,
There, in the arena of life, you and I,
In the ceaseless quest of the 'whys'.

Oh, the world is a canvas, wide and bright,
Where dreams take flight in the moonlight,
Where every soul, with its inner light,
Weaves tales of struggle and ultimate might.

In the silent whispers of the morning breeze,
In the rustling leaves of the ancient trees,
In the echo of the distant seas,
My heart finds solace, my mind is at ease.

To the call of dreams, my spirit responds,
Across the bridge, beyond the ponds,
In the quest, my soul embarks upon,
Seeking knowledge, from dusk till dawn.

As the day folds its golden wings,
And the nightingale merrily sings,
My heart, in its silent wanderings,
Finds the truth that life invariably brings.

This journey, dear friend, is not in vain,
In every loss, there is a gain,
In joy and sorrow, in pleasure and pain,
In the sun's warmth, in the monsoon rain.

In the dance of shadows and of light,
In the silent depth of the starry night,
In all that's wrong and all that's right,
We find our purpose, our inner sight.

So, let's weave our dreams in the canvas of time,
In the rhythm of life, in the life's rhyme,
In the symphony of the universe, in its chime,
In pursuit of the truth, in the quest sublime. \\ \midrule
