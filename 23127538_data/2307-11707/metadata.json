  "abstract": "The two gravitational form factors of the pion, $A^π(t)$ and $D^π(t)$, are computed as functions of the momentum transfer squared $t$ in the kinematic region $0\\leq -t< 2~\\text{GeV}^2$ on a lattice QCD ensemble with quark masses corresponding to a close-to-physical pion mass $m_π\\approx 170~\\text{MeV}$ and $N_f=2+1$ quark flavors. The flavor decomposition of these form factors into gluon, up/down light-quark, and strange-quark contributions is presented in the $\\overline{\\text{MS}}$ scheme at energy scale $μ=2~\\text{GeV}$, with renormalization factors computed nonperturbatively via the RI-MOM scheme. Using monopole and $z$-expansion fits to the gravitational form factors, we obtain estimates for the pion momentum fraction and $D$-term that are consistent with the momentum fraction sum rule and the next-to-leading order chiral perturbation theory prediction for $D^π(0)$.",
