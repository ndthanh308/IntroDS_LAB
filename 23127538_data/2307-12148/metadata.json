  "abstract": "We look into the ontology of quantum theory as distinct from that of the classical theory in the sciences, following a broadly Kantian tradition and distinguishing between the noumenal and phenomenal realities where the former is independent of our perception while the latter is assembled from the former by means of fragmentary bits of interpretation. Within this framework, theories are conceptual constructs applying to models generated in the phenomenal world within limited contexts.The ontology of quantum theory principally rests on the view that entities in the world are pervasively correlated with one another not by means of probabilities as in the case of the classical theory, but by means of probability amplitudes involving finely tuned phases of quantum mechanical states (entanglement). The quantum correlations are shared globally in the process of environment-induced decoherence whereby locally generated correlations are removed, the removal being especially manifest in the case of systems that appear as classical ones, in which case the process is almost instantaneous, being, in all likelihood, driven by field fluctuations in the Planck regime. This points to factors of an unknown nature determining its finest details, since Planck scale physics remains an obscure terrain. In other words, the present day quantum theory holds within a limited context set by the Planck scale.",
