  abstract   = {Coalgebraic bisimilarity minimization generalizes classical automaton minimization to a large class of automata whose transition structure is specified by a functor, subsuming strong, weighted, and probabilistic bisimilarity. This offers the enticing possibility of turning bisimilarity minimization into an off-the-shelf technology, without having to develop a new algorithm for each new type of automaton. Unfortunately, there is no existing algorithm that is fully general, efficient, and able to handle large systems. We present a generic algorithm that minimizes coalgebras over an arbitrary functor in the category of sets as long as the action on morphisms is sufficiently computable. The functor makes at most O(m logn) calls to the functor-specific action, where n is the number of states and m is the number of transitions in the coalgebra. While more specialized algorithms can be asymptotically faster than our algorithm (usually by a factor of (m/n)), our algorithm is especially well suited to efficient implementation, and our tool often uses much less time and memory on existing benchmarks, and can handle larger automata, despite being more generic.},

  abstract = {In the semantics of programming, finite data types such as finite lists, have traditionally been modelled by initial algebras. Later final coalgebras were used in order to deal with infinite data types. Coalgebras, which are the dual of algebras, turned out to be suited, moreover, as models for certain types of automata and more generally, for (transition and dynamical) systems. An important property of initial algebras is that they satisfy the familiar principle of induction. Such a principle was missing for coalgebras until the work of Aczel (Non-Well-Founded sets, CSLI Leethre Notes, Vol. 14, center for the study of Languages and information, Stanford, 1988) on a theory of non-wellfounded sets, in which he introduced a proof principle nowadays called coinduction. It was formulated in terms of bisimulation, a notion originally stemming from the world of concurrent programming languages. Using the notion of coalgebra homomorphism, the definition of bisimulation on coalgebras can be shown to be formally dual to that of congruence on algebras. Thus, the three basic notions of universal algebra: algebra, homomorphism of algebras, and congruence, turn out to correspond to coalgebra, homomorphism of coalgebras, and bisimulation, respectively. In this paper, the latter are taken as the basic ingredients of a theory called universal coalgebra. Some standard results from universal algebra are reformulated (using the aforementioned correspondence) and proved for a large class of coalgebras, leading to a series of results on, e.g., the lattices of subcoalgebras and bisimulations, simple coalgebras and coinduction, and a covariety theorem for coalgebras similar to Birkhoff's variety theorem.}

Our main results provide sufficient criteria for the validity of such principles: in the presence of comprehension, the induction principle for initial algebras is admissible, and dually, in the presence of quotient types, the coinduction principle for terminal coalgebras is admissible. After giving an alternative formulation of induction in terms of binary relations, we combine both principles and obtain a mixed induction/coinduction principle which allows us to reason about minimal solutionsX≅σ(X) whereXmay occur both positively and negatively in the type constructor σ. We further strengthen these logical principles to deal with contexts and prove that such strengthening is valid when the (abstract) logic we consider is contextually/functionally complete. All the main results follow from a basic result about adjunctions between “categories of algebras” (inserters).}

This coalgebraic formulation makes it possible to generalize the concepts of discrete probabilistic transition system and probabilistic bisimulation to a continuous setting involving Borel probability measures. A functor ℳ1 is introduced that yields for a metric space its collection of Borel probability measures. Under reasonable conditions, this functor exactly captures generalized probabilistic bisimilarity. Application of the final coalgebra paradigm to a functor based on ℳ1 then yields an internally fully abstract semantical domain with respect to probabilistic bisimulation, which is therefore well suited for the interpretation of probabilistic specification and stochastic programming concepts.}

Although the existence of the algorithm is widely known, its theoretical justification, correctness and running time analysis are not. We give here a tutorial reconstruction of Hopcroft's algorithm focusing on a firm theoretical basis, clear correctness proofs and a well-founded computational analysis. Our analysis reveals that if the size of the input alphabet m is not fixed, then Hopcroft's original algorithm does not run in time O(mnlogn) as is commonly believed in the literature. The O(mnlogn) holds, however, for the variation presented later by D. Gries and for a new variant given in this article. We also propose a new efficient routine for refining the equivalence classes constructed in the algorithm and suggest a computationally sound heuristics as an enhancement.}

The equivalence problems in CCS are presented as refinements of the familiar problem of testing whether two nondeterministic finite automata (NFA) are equivalent, i.e., accept the same language. Three notions of equivalence proposed for CCS are investigated, namely, observational equivalence, strong observational equivalence, and failure equivalence. We show that observational equivalence can be tested in polynomial time. As defined in CCS, observational equivalence is the limit of a sequence of successively finer equivalence relations, ≈k, where ≈1 is nondeterministic finite automaton equivalence. We prove that, for each fixed k, deciding ≈k is PSPACE-complete. We show that strong observational equivalence can be decided in polynomial time by reducing it to generalized partitioning, a new combinatorial problem of independent interest. Finally, we demonstrate that testing for failure equivalence is PSPACE-complete, even for a very restricted type of process.}

Its time consumption is O(m logn), where n is the number of states and m is the number of transitions. Unlike earlier algorithms, it meets this bound even if the number of different labels of transitions is not fixed. It is based on refining a partition on states with respect to the labelled transitions. A splitter is a pair consisting of a set in the partition and a label. Earlier algorithms consume lots of time in scanning splitters that have no corresponding relevant transitions. The new algorithm avoids this by maintaining the sets of the corresponding transitions. To facilitate this, a refinable partition data structure with amortized constant time operations is introduced. Detailed pseudocode and correctness proof are presented, as well as some measurements.},

Recently, we have developed a partition refinement algorithm that is generic in the transition type of the given system and matches the run time of the best known algorithms for many concrete types of systems, e.g. deterministic automata as well as ordinary, weighted, and probabilistic (labelled) transition systems. Genericity is achieved by modelling transition types as functors on sets, and systems as coalgebras. In the present work, we refine the run time analysis of our algorithm to cover additional instances, notably weighted automata and, more generally, weighted tree automata. For weights in a cancellative monoid we match, and for non-cancellative monoids such as (the additive monoid of) the tropical semiring even substantially improve, the asymptotic run time of the best known algorithms. We have implemented our algorithm in a generic tool that is easily instantiated to concrete system types by implementing a simple refinement interface. Moreover, the algorithm and the tool are modular, and partition refiners for new types of systems are obtained easily by composing pre-implemented basic functors. Experiments show that even for complex system types, the tool is able to handle systems with millions of transitions.},

  abstract  = {In 2003, Derisavi, Hermanns, and Sanders presented a complicated O(m logn) time algorithm for the Markov chain lumping problem, where n is the number of states and m the number of transitions in the Markov chain. They speculated on the possibility of a simple algorithm and wrote that it would probably need a new way of sorting weights. In this article we present an algorithm of that kind. In it, the weights are sorted with a combination of the so-called possible majority candidate algorithm with any O(k logk) sorting algorithm. This works because, as we prove in the article, the weights consist of two groups, one of which is sufficiently small and all weights in the other group have the same value. We also point out an essential problem in the description of the earlier algorithm, prove the correctness of our algorithm in detail, and report some running time measurements.},
