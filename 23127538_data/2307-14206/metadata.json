  "abstract": "This exploratory study investigates the potential of the artificial intelligence tool, ChatGPT, to support systems thinking (ST) in various subjects. Using both general and subject specific prompts, the study assesses the accuracy, helpfulness, and reliability of ChatGPT's responses across different versions of the tool. The results indicate that ChatGPT can provide largely correct and very helpful responses in various subjects, demonstrating its potential as a tool for enhancing ST skills. However, occasional inaccuracies highlight the need for users to remain critical of ChatGPT's responses. Despite some limitations, this study suggests that with careful use and attention to its idiosyncrasies, ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for teaching and learning ST.",
