  "abstract": "Regression testing is crucial in ensuring that pure code refactoring does not adversely affect existing software functionality, but it can be expensive, accounting for half the cost of software maintenance. Automated test case generation reduces effort but may generate weak test suites. Test amplification is a promising solution that enhances tests by generating additional or improving existing ones, increasing test coverage, but it faces the test oracle problem. To address this, we propose a test oracle derivation approach that uses object state data produced during System Under Test (SUT) test execution to amplify regression test oracles. The approach monitors the object state during test execution and compares it to the previous version to detect any changes in relation to the SUT's intended behaviour. Our preliminary evaluation shows that the proposed approach can enhance the detection of behaviour changes substantially, providing initial evidence of its effectiveness.",
