PageRank is a famous measure of graph centrality that has numerous applications in practice. The problem of computing a single node's PageRank has been the subject of extensive research over a decade. However, existing methods still incur large time complexities despite years of efforts. Even on undirected graphs where several valuable properties held by PageRank scores, the problem of locally approximating the PageRank score of a target node remains a challenging task. Two commonly adopted techniques, Monte-Carlo based random walks and backward push, both cost $O(n)$ time in the worst-case scenario, which hinders existing methods from achieving a sublinear time complexity like $O(\sqrt{m})$ on an undirected graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges. 
%existing methods are still hard to achieve a sublinear time complexity like $O(\sqrt{m})$ on an undirected graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges. 

%The problem of single-node PageRank computation on undirected graphs is also of great importance from both practical and theoretical aspects. However, existing methods mainly focus on directed graphs, and fail to fully utilize these properties to improve the complexity bounds on undirected graphs. Despite years of efforts, existing methods still incur large time complexities even on undirected graphs. Two commonly adopted techniques, Monte-Carlo based random walks and backward push, both incur an $O(n)$ time complexity in the worst-case scenario, which hinders existing methods to achieve a sublinear time complexity like $O(\sqrt{m})$ on an undirected graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges. 

%However, existing methods mainly focus on directed graphs, and fail to fully utilize these properties to improve the complexity bounds on undirected graphs. As a result, the state-of-the-art method for single-node PageRank computation on undirected graphs turns out to be the methods originally proposed on directed graphs, leading to significant theoretical gaps to be improved on undirected graphs. 

%designing a local algorithm to estimate a single node's PageRank with constant relative error still remains a challenging task. 

In this paper, we focus on the problem of single-node PageRank computation on undirected graphs. We propose a novel algorithm, \setpush, for estimating single-node PageRank specifically on undirected graphs. With non-trival analysis, we prove that our \setpush achieves the $\tilde{O}\left(\min\left\{d_t, \sqrt{m}\right\}\right)$ time complexity for estimating the target node $t$'s PageRank with constant relative error and constant failure probability on undirected graphs. 
%The core of our \setpush is a novel probability push operation, which flexibly mixes the deterministic backward push operation and the randomized Monte-Carlo sampling in an atomic step. %Benefit from the push operation, we successfully reduce the $O(n)$ term introduced by the vanilla backward push operation. Furthermore, 
%We also fully leverage the theoretical properties of PageRank on undirected graphs for improving the complexity. %we leverage the properties of PageRank on undirected graphs in an non-trivial way to break the $O(n)$ lower bound for the Monte-Carlo sampling. %Benefit from the independence of the sampling operation adopted in our \setpush, we present a non-trivial theoretical analysis to bound the variance of our \setpush in a simple form. 
%As a consequence, our \setpush is theoretically demonstrated to be asymptotically better than those of existing methods on undirected graphs (unless on a complete graph). 
We conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of \setpush.
