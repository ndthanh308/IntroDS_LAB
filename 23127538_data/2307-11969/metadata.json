  "abstract": "This paper is concerned with the uniqueness in inverse acoustic and electromagnetic scattering with phaseless near-field data generated by superpositions of two incident plane waves at a fixed frequency. It can be proved that the unknown scatterer can be uniquely determined by the phaseless near-field data. The proof is based on the analysis of the phase information and the application of Rellich's lemma together with the Green's formula for the radiating solutions to the Helmholtz equation or the Stratton--Chu formula for the radiating solutions to the Maxwell equations.",
