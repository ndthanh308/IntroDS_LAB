  "abstract": "Van der Waals magnetic materials are currently of great interest as materials for applications in future ultrathin nanoelectronics and nanospintronics. Due to weak coupling between individual monolayers, these materials can be easily obtained in the monolayer and bilayer forms. The latter are of specific interest as they may be considered as natural two-dimensional spin valves. In this paper, we study theoretically spin waves in bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides. The considerations are carried within the general spin wave theory based on effective spin Hamiltonian and Hollstein-Primakoff-Bogolubov transformation. The spin Hamiltonian includes intra-layer as well as inter-layer nearest-neighbour exchange interactions, easy-plane anisotropy, and additionally a weak in-plane easy-axis anisotropy. The bilayer systems consist of two ferromagnetic (in-plane magnetization) monolayers that are coupled either ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically. In the latter case, we analyse the spin wave spectra in all magnetic phases, i.e. in the antiferromagnetic, spin-flop, and ferromagnetic ones.",
