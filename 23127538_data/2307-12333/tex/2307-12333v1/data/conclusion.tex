In this paper, we theoretically prove that under reasonable assumptions, the evolution from a base linear classifier to residual neural networks should be modeled by a convection-diffusion equation. Motivated by PDE theory, we analyze the robustness and Rademacher complexity of the proposed isotropic models. Based on these theoretical results, we develop a training method for ResNet and verify its effectiveness through experiments. We are aware that modeling the convection-diffusion equation through introducing a regularization term is one of the many possible approaches. We are looking forward to explore other paths in the future work.
