  "abstract": "Given an elliptic curve defined over a number field $F$, we study the algebraic structure and prove a control theorem for Wuthrich's fine Mordell--Weil groups over a $\\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $F$, generalizing results of Lee on the usual Mordell--Weil groups. In the case where $F=\\mathbb{Q}$, we show that the characteristic ideal of the Pontryagin dual of the fine Mordell--Weil group over the cyclotomic $\\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension coincides with Greenberg's prediction for the characteristic ideal of the dual fine Selmer group. If furthermore $E$ has good supersingular reduction at $p$ with $a_p(E)=0$, we generalize Wuthrich's fine Mordell--Weil groups to define \"plus and minus Mordell--Weil groups\". We show that the greatest common divisor of the characteristic ideals of the Pontryagin duals of these groups coincides with Kurihara--Pollack's prediction for the greatest common divisor of the plus and minus $p$-adic $L$-functions.",
