  "abstract": "The structural and magnetic properties of the geometrically frustrated spin-$1/2$ capped-kagome antiferromagnet (RbCl)Cu$_{5}$P$_{2}$O$_{10}$ are investigated via temperature dependent x-ray diffraction, magnetization, heat capacity, and $^{31}$P NMR experiments on a polycrystalline sample. It undergoes a structural transition at around $T_{\\rm t} \\simeq 310$ K from a high temperature trigonal ($P\\bar{3}m1$) to a low temperature monoclinic ($C2/c$) unit cell, where the low temperature structure features the capped-kagome geometry of Cu$^{2+}$ ions. Interestingly, it shows the onset of two successive magnetic transitions at $T_{\\rm N1} \\simeq 20$ K and $T_{\\rm N2} \\simeq 7$ K. The shape of the $^{31}$P NMR spectra unfold the possible nature of the transitions below $T_{\\rm N1}$ and $T_{\\rm N2}$ to be of incommensurate and commensurate antiferromagnetic type, respectively. A large value of the Curie-Weiss temperature as compared to $T_{\\rm N1}$ sets the frustration parameter $f \\simeq 8$, ensuring strong magnetic frustration in the compound. From the $^{31}$P NMR spin-lattice relaxation rate, the leading antiferromagnetic exchange coupling is estimated to be $J/k_{\\rm B} \\simeq 117$ K. These unusual double magnetic transitions make this compound beguiling for further investigations.",
