  "abstract": "Systems with flat bands are ideal for studying strongly correlated electronic states and related phenomena. Among them, kagome-structured metals such as CoSn have been recognized as promising candidates due to the proximity between the flat bands and the Fermi level. A key next step will be to realize epitaxial kagome thin films with flat bands to enable tuning of the flat bands across the Fermi level via electrostatic gating or strain. Here we report the band structures of epitaxial CoSn thin films grown directly on insulating substrates. Flat bands are observed using synchrotron-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The band structure is consistent with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and the transport properties are quantitatively explained by the band structure and semiclassical transport theory. Our work paves the way to realize flat band-induced phenomena through fine-tuning of flat bands in kagome materials.",
