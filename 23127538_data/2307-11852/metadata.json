  "abstract": "A canonical Hamiltonian is found for a reduced version of the Jackiw-Pi model for bilayer graphene. From the corresponding Lagrangian, the Noether point symmetries and conserved quantities are determined. The Noether symmetry group is the same as the fifth-dimensional group for the time-dependent harmonic oscillator. The realization of the algebra is achieved in terms of just one particular solution $g_1$ of the time-dependent harmonic oscillator equation underlying the reduced Jackiw-Pi model. Some numerical solutions are worked out.",
