\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

The \Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) has been surveying the high-energy $\gamma$-ray sky since 2008 \citep{LAT09_instrument} and the LAT Collaboration has published a succession of source catalogs based on comprehensive analyses of LAT data.
The fourth source catalog \citep[4FGL,][]{LAT20_4FGL} was derived from analysis of the first 8 years of LAT science data. It was followed by two incremental versions (Data Releases) called DR2 \citep{LAT20_4FGLDR2} and DR3 \citep{LAT22_4FGLDR3}, each adding two years of data.
This new Data Release (DR4) covers 14 years of data.
This note focuses on what has changed since DR3, and describes the results. The reader is referred to the 4FGL and DR3 papers for the detailed methodology, and the official reference remains the DR3 paper.

Section~\ref{lat_and_background} describes the data and the updates to the diffuse model, Section~\ref{catalog_main} the updates to the analysis and the results, and Section~\ref{dr4_assocs} the updates to the associations.
