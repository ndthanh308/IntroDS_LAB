  "abstract": "We investigate the production process of induced gravity waves due to large scalar fluctuations in the paradigm of quintessential inflation. We numerically solve the Mukhanov-Sasaki equation for different sets of parameters to obtain the power spectra. We demonstrate that the induced gravity wave signal generated in this framework can falls within the region of the NANOGrav data for chosen values of model parameters. We show that there is an allowed region of parameter space where the effect shifts to high frequency regime relevant to LISA and other available sensitivities.",
