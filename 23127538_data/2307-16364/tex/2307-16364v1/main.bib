abstract = {Parsons problems are a type of programming exercise where students rearrange jumbled code blocks of a solution program back into its original form. It is usually implemented as a complement or alternative to traditional programming exercises like code-tracing and code-writing. This paper reviews the existing literature on the Parsons problem in introductory CS education. We find that the flexible nature of the design of Parsons problems has led to many variants, and these have been continuously refined to better address student needs. However, the effectiveness of Parsons problems, both as a question type and as a learning tool in CS education, remains uncertain due to a lack of replicated research in the field.},

abstract = {The question of how to teach classical, rule-based programming has been driving much of the computing education research since the 1950s. In the K--12 (school) context, a consensus has emerged over time on the paradigmatic elements of computing education, which implicitly assumes a von Neumann computer executing instruction sequences guided by imperative programs. Within this framework, many researchers have focused on how to facilitate learners to develop an accurate mental model of what the computer does when it executes a piece of code.However, the traditional programming approach in computing education is inadequate for understanding and developing machine learning (ML) driven technology. ML has already facilitated significant advancements in automation, ranging from speech and image recognition, autonomous cars, and deepfake videos to super-human performance in board and computer games, and more. Many data-driven approaches that power today's cutting edge services and apps significantly diverge from the central paradigmatic assumptions of traditional programming. Consequently, traditional views on computing education are increasingly being challenged to account for the changes that AI/ML brings.This keynote talk presents early results from a study on how to teach fundamental AI insights and techniques to 200 4--9 graders in 14 primary schools in Eastern Finland. It describes the learning environments, tools, and pedagogical approaches involved, and explores the paradigmatic and conceptual changes required in transitioning from teaching classical programming to teaching ML in K--12 computing education. It outlines the mindset shifts required for this transition and discusses the challenges posed to the development of curricula, educational technology, and learning environments. It further provides examples of how AI ethics concepts, such as algorithmic bias, privacy, misinformation, diversity, and accountability, can be integrated into ML education.The talk discusses the relationship between different literacies in computing and presents an active concept, data agency, that refers to people's volition and capacity for informed actions that make a difference in their digital world. It emphasizes not only the understanding of data (i.e., data literacy) but also the active control and manipulation of information flows and the ethical and wise use of them.},

abstract = {Recent breakthroughs in deep learning have led to the emergence of generative AI models that exhibit extraordinary performance at producing human-like outputs. Using only simple input prompts, it is possible to generate novel text, images, video, music, and source code, as well as tackle tasks such as answering questions and translating and summarising text.However, the potential for these models to impact computing education practice is only just beginning to be explored. For example, novices learning to code can now use free tools that automatically suggest solutions to programming exercises and assignments; yet these tools were not designed with novices in mind and little to nothing is known about how they will impact learning. Furthermore, much attention has focused on the immediate challenges these models present, such as academic integrity concerns. It seems that even in the AI-era a pending apocalypse sells better than a promising renaissance.Generative AI will likely play an increasing role in people's lives in the reasonably foreseeable future. Model performance seems set to continue accelerating while novel uses and new possibilities multiply. Given this, we should devote just as much effort to identifying and exploiting new opportunities as we do to identifying and mitigating challenges.In this talk, we begin by discussing several concrete and research-backed opportunities for computing educators. Many of these have already shown great promise in positively impacting current practice. We then discuss more short- to medium-term possibilities in areas such as student recruitment, and curricular changes. Finally - against our better judgement - we speculate over the longer-term, including rethinking the very fundamentals of the practice of teaching introductory and advanced computing courses. In these discussions we suggest potential research questions and directions. Although making remotely accurate predictions in such a fast-changing landscape is foolhardy, we believe that now is the time to explore and embrace opportunities to help make positive change in as many computing classrooms as possible.},

abstract = {Drill and practice exercises enable students to master skills needed for more sophisticated programming. A barrier to providing such activities is the effort required to set up the programming environment. Testing is an important component to writing good software, but it is difficult to motivate students to write tests. In this paper we describe and evaluate CodeWrite, a web-based tool that provides drill and practice support for Java programming, and for which testing plays a central role in its use. We describe how we have used CodeWrite in a CS1 course, and demonstrate its effectiveness in providing good coverage of the language features presented in the course.},

Traditional approaches using the latest GPT-3 language model without program synthesis achieve a solve rate of 0.2 in these classes. In contrast, by turning course questions into probabilistic programs using the latest program synthesis Transformer, OpenAI Codex, and executing the programs, our solve rates are 0.9 and 0.88, which are on par with human performance.},

abstract = {Problem-solving is a central activity to computing, and thus a key skill that novices develop when learning programming. While most programming-related concepts are taught explicitly in introductory courses, it is common for problem-solving to be taught implicitly – usually through having students perform programming drills. This approach can be problematic for some learners and may lead to the development of unproductive problem solving strategies that leave students feeling lost when faced with new problems. A substantial body of work has investigated the explicit teaching of problem-solving and related metacognitive skills. This prior literature has shown that teaching students a model for the problem-solving process and how to track their progress within that model leads to greater self-efficacy and productivity. Interventions targeting isolated steps in these models have been shown to work, but there have been few efforts to combine such interventions into a single coherent system. Our contribution is a novel tool called Metacodenition, which is a programming environment for novices that provides metacognitive scaffolding around an existing problem-solving framework. We find that Metacodenition’s scaffolding improves performance on code-writing tasks and that students view Metacodenition to be a helpful tool they would use voluntarily.},

abstract = {Prior research has shown that novices face metacognitive difficulties associated with understanding problem statements. Metacognition refers to the processes that an individual uses to plan, monitor, and assess their own understanding and performance and is often described as "thinking about thinking." Metacognitive awareness is a higher-order thinking skill that includes knowing when and how to use particular strategies for problem-solving. However, novice students often lack metacognitive skills. This can be a disadvantage, particularly when learning in unfamiliar domains. For instance, students who misinterpret a problem statement will most likely form an invalid mental model of the problem which they may find difficult to correct. A prior think-aloud study that used an intervention focused on this initial step in the problem-solving process showed promising results at a small scale. In this paper, we report on a large (n = 976) controlled experiment to examine the scalability of the aforementioned study. We measure the effect on novice programmer performance of metacognitive scaffolding that requires deliberate reflection on the problem statement before any code is written. Although control and experimental groups exhibited similar completion rates overall, students in the experimental group encountered significantly fewer errors that related to the formation of an incorrect mental model of the problem. These results hold promise in moving towards more reliable methods for developing metacognitive awareness in novice programmers.},
