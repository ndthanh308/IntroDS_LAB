  "abstract": "This work introduces a novel framework for dynamic factor model-based group-level analysis of multiple subjects time series data, called GRoup Integrative DYnamic factor (GRIDY) models. The framework identifies and characterizes inter-subject similarities and differences between two pre-determined groups by considering a combination of group spatial information and individual temporal dynamics. Furthermore, it enables the identification of intra-subject similarities and differences over time by employing different model configurations for each subject. Methodologically, the framework combines a novel principal angle-based rank selection algorithm and a non-iterative integrative analysis framework. Inspired by simultaneous component analysis, this approach also reconstructs identifiable latent factor series with flexible covariance structures. The performance of the GRIDY models is evaluated through simulations conducted under various scenarios. An application is also presented to compare resting-state functional MRI data collected from multiple subjects in autism spectrum disorder and control groups.",
