\section{Conclusion \& Future Direction}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This paper has presented the results of the RoboDepth Challenge. In this challenge, we were dedicated to encouraging out-of-distribution depth estimation to meet safety-critical requirements. Our top-performing participants presented diverse designs and techniques that are proven useful in improving the robustness of depth estimation models under common corruptions. We compared and summarized robustness enhancement strategies from different aspects and drew insightful observations behind them. It is worth mentioning again that promising results have been achieved on the challenging testing sets across two tracks of this challenge. We believe that the  RoboDepth Challenge has shed light on the development of depth estimation systems that are reliable, scalable, and generalizable.

Future editions of the RoboDepth Challenge seek further improvements from the following aspects:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Extension of the scale and diversity of robustness evaluation sets. The current RoboDepth benchmarks only considered two distinct data sources and five discrete severity levels. Simulating continuous severity changes on more depth estimation datasets is desirable.
    \item Integration of more depth estimation tasks. While this challenge mainly focused on monocular depth estimation, it is important to study also the robustness of other related tasks, such as stereo, panorama, and surrounding-view depth estimation.
    \item Exploration of other techniques that could improve the OoD robustness. The recent vision foundation models have opened up new possibilities for unified and generalizable visual perception. It would be interesting to combine these models for robust depth estimation.
    \item Pursuit of both robustness and efficiency. Since the depth estimation system might require in-vehicle deployment, the use of certain techniques, such as model ensemble and TTA, would become unreasonable. It is thus crucial to design suitable latency constraints.
\end{itemize}
