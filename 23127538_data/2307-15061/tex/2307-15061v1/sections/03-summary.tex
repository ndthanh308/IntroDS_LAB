\section{Challenge Summary}
\label{sec:challenge_summary}

\subsection{Overall Statistics}
This is the first edition of the RoboDepth Challenge. The official evaluation servers\footnote{We built servers on CodaLab. More details of this platform are at \url{https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr}.} of this competition were launched on 01 January 2023. During the five-month period of competition, $226$ teams registered on our servers; among them, $66$ teams attempted to make submissions. Finally, we received $1137$ valid submissions and selected six winning teams (three teams for each track) and three innovation prize awardees. The detailed information of the winning teams and innovation prize awardees is shown in Table~\ref{tab:summary} and Table~\ref{tab:summary_innovation}, respectively.

\subsection{Track \# 1: Robust Self-Supervised Depth Estimation}
\noindent\textbf{Evaluation Server}. The first track of the RoboDepth Challenge was hosted at \url{https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/9418}. The participants were requested to submit their depth disparity maps to our server for evaluation. Such depth predictions were expected to be generated by a learning-based model, in a self-supervised learning manner, trained on the official \textit{training} split of the KITTI dataset \cite{geiger2012kitti}.

\noindent\textbf{Statistics}. In the first track of the RoboDepth Challenge, a total number of $137$ teams registered at our evaluation server. We received $684$ valid submissions during the competition period. The top-three best-performing teams are \texttt{OpenSpaceAI}, \texttt{USTC-IAT-United}, and \texttt{YYQ}. Additionally, we selected the teams \texttt{Ensemble} and \texttt{Scent-Depth} as the innovation prize awardees of this track.


\subsection{Track \# 2: Robust Supervised Depth Estimation}
\noindent\textbf{Evaluation Server}. The second track of the RoboDepth Challenge was hosted at \url{https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/9821}. The participants were requested to submit their depth disparity maps to our server for evaluation. Such depth predictions were expected to be generated by a learning-based model, in a fully-supervised learning manner, trained on the official \textit{training} split of the NYUDepth V2 dataset \cite{silberman2012nyu2}.

\noindent\textbf{Statistics}. In the second track of the RoboDepth Challenge, a total number of $89$ teams registered at our evaluation server. We received $453$ valid submissions during the competition period. The top-three best-performing teams are \texttt{USTCxNetEaseFuxi}, \texttt{OpenSpaceAI}, and \texttt{GANCV}. Additionally, we selected the team \texttt{AIIA-RDepth} as the innovation prize awardee of this track.

\subsection{The RoboDepth Workshop}
We hosted the online workshop at ICRA 2023 on 02 June 2023 after the competition was officially concluded. Six winning teams and three innovation prize awardees attended and presented their approaches.

The video recordings of this workshop are publicly available at \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYhdTGiIGCY&list=PLxxrIfcH-qBGZ6x_e1AT2_YnAxiHIKtkB}.
