Following on from Section \ref{subsec:opponent_frac_partisan}, after noting outliers with large $t_{\rm a}$, we anticipated that these outliers are due to a lack of interactions.  
That is, as $f$ approaches one, there are fewer persuadable agents interacting. 
We investigate this behavior by considering the extreme case of a single Bayesian learner, under no influence of any internal signal, hence lacking any interaction.  
Fig.\ \ref{fig:one_agent} shows the distribution of $t_{\rm a}$ for an ensemble of $10^4$ simulations. 
Each simulation achieved asymptotic learning, with 99\% of the simulations doing so in $t < 2608$ and $\langle t_{\rm a} \rangle = 1068$. 
The distribution has a long tail at large $t_{\rm a}$, with $\max{t_{\rm a}} = 6462$.

We again see some (8) extreme outliers with $t_{\rm a} > 4000$.  Note that we did not observe this behaviour in the
