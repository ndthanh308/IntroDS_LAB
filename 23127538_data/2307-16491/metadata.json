  "abstract": "We are concerned with the following time-fractional semilinear heat equation in the $N$-dimensional whole space ${\\bf R}^N$ with $N \\geq 1$.\n  \\[\n  {\\rm (P)}_α\\qquad\n  \\partial_t^αu -Δu = u^p,\\quad t>0,\\,\\,\\, x\\in{\\bf R}^N, \\qquad\n  u(0) = μ\\quad \\mbox{in}\\quad {\\bf R}^N,\n  \\]\n  where $\\partial_t^α$ denotes the Caputo derivative of order $α\\in (0,1)$, $p>1$, and $μ$ is a nonnegative Radon measure on ${\\bf R}^N$. The case $α=1$ formally gives the Fujita-type equation (P)$_1$ \\ $\\partial_tu-Δu=u^p$. In particular, we mainly focus on the Fujita critical case where $p=p_F:=1+2/N$. It is well known that the Fujita exponent $p_F$ separates the ranges of $p$ for the global-in-time solvability of (P)$_1$. In particular, (P)$_1$ with $p=p_F$ possesses no global-in-time solutions, and does not locally-in-time solvable in its scale critical space $L^1(\\mathbf{R}^N)$. It is also known that the exponent $p_F$ plays the same role for the global-in-time solvability for (P)$_α$. However, the problem (P)$_α$ with $p=p_F$ is globally-in-time solvable, and exhibites local-in-time solvability in its scale critical space $L^1(\\mathbf{R}^N)$. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the collapse of the global and local-in-time solvability of (P)$_α$ as $α$ approaches $1-0$.",
