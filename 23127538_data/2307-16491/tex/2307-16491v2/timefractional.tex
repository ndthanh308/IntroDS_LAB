		\[
		{\rm (P)}_\alpha \qquad 
          \partial_t^\alpha u -\Delta u = u^p,\quad  t>0,\,\,\, x\in{\bf R}^N, \qquad

		where $\partial_t^\alpha$ denotes the Caputo derivative of order $\alpha \in (0,1)$, $p>1$, and $\mu$ is a nonnegative Radon measure on ${\bf R}^N$.  The case $\alpha=1$ formally gives the Fujita-type equation (P)$_1$ \ $\partial_tu-\Delta u=u^p$. In particular, we mainly focus on the Fujita critical case where $p=p_F:=1+2/N$. It is well known that the Fujita exponent $p_F$ separates the ranges of $p$ for the global-in-time solvability of (P)$_1$. In particular, (P)$_1$ with $p=p_F$ possesses no global-in-time solutions, and does not locally-in-time solvable in its scale critical space $L^1(\mathbf{R}^N)$. It is also known that the exponent $p_F$ plays the same role for the global-in-time solvability for (P)$_\alpha$. However, the problem (P)$_\alpha$ with $p=p_F$ is globally-in-time solvable, and exhibites local-in-time solvability in its scale critical space $L^1(\mathbf{R}^N)$. The purpose of this paper is to clarify the collapse of the global and local-in-time solvability of (P)$_\alpha$ as $\alpha$ approaches $1-0$.

	\subsection{Introduction.}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	Let us consider nonnegative solutions of the following time-fractional semilinear parabolic equation in the $N$-dimensional whole space ${\bf R}^N$ with $N \geq 1$.
	\begin{equation}
	\label{TFF}
	\left\{
	\begin{split}
	\partial_t^\alpha u -\Delta u &= u^p\ &&\mbox{in}\ (0,T)\times{\bf R}^N,\\
	u(0) &= \mu\  &&\mbox{in}\ \ {\bf R}^N,\\
	\end{split}
	\right.
	\end{equation}
	where $p>1$ and
	$\mu$ is a nonnegative Radon measure on ${\bf R}^N$. 
	Here, $\partial_t^\alpha$ is the Caputo derivative of order $\alpha\in (0,1)$, that is
	\[
		(\partial_t^\alpha f)(t) := \frac{1}{\Gamma(1-\alpha)} \frac{d}{dt} \int_0^t \frac{f(s)-f(0)}{(t-s)^{\alpha}}\,ds,
	\] 
	where $\Gamma$ is the gamma function. This mathematical model 
      has been proposed to interpret anomalous diffusion, which is different from the conventional one based on the Brownian motion. For the mathematical treatment of time-fractional equations, see, e.g., \cite{Podl99, GalWar20, LuchYama19}.
	
	The case where $\alpha=1$ corresponds to the Fujita-type equation
	\begin{equation}
	\label{Fjt}
	\partial_t  u -\Delta u = u^p,\quad  t>0,\,\,\, x\in{\bf R}^N, \qquad
	u(0) = \mu  \quad \mbox{in}\quad {\bf R}^N.
	\end{equation}
	The solvability of the Cauchy problem \eqref{Fjt} has been studied extensively by many mathematicians since the pioneering work of Fujita \cite{Fujita66}. (See, e.g., \cite{QuitSoup19}, which includes an extensive list of references for problem \eqref{Fjt}.) In what follows, denote the Fujita exponent by $p_F:=1+2/N$. For the global-in-time solvability of the problem \eqref{Fjt}, it is known that the condition $1<p\le p_F$ implies the nonexistence of any global-in-time solutions, while $p>p_F$ guarantees the global-in-time solvability of the equation for appropriate initial data.  We emphasize that in the Fujita critical case, i.e., when $p=p_F$, the global-in-time solvability fails. See \cite{Fujita66, Sugitani75, Hayakawa73, KoSiTa77}. Furthermore, the local-in-time solvability of \eqref{Fjt} in its scale critical space $L^{\frac{N(p-1)}{2}}(\mathbf{R}^N)$ is guaranteed, provided $N(p-1)/2>1$. However, as for the doubly critical case where $p=p_F$ and $\mu\in L^1({\bf R}^N)$ (i.e., the simultaneous occurrence of Fujita critical and scale critical), it is known that \eqref{Fjt} may not have any local-in-time solutions for certain singular initial data. See e.g. \cite{BreCaz96, Miya21}. Roughly speaking, equation \eqref{Fjt} with $p=p_F$ exhibits the global and local-in-time unsolvability.
	
	On the other hand, it is shown in Zhang and Sun \cite{ZhanSun15} that also for \eqref{TFF}, the common exponent $p_F$ becomes the critical one which separates the range of $p$ for the nonexistence and the existence of global-in-time solutions, that is, \eqref{TFF} is not globally-in-time solvable if $1<p<p_F$, 
    while the equation possesses a global-in-time solution if $p>p_F$. However, for the critical case $ p=p_F$, it is also shown in \cite{ZhanSun15} that \eqref{TFF} has a global-in-time solution. Moreover, for the local-in-time solvability, \cite{GMS22, ZLS19} showed that \eqref{TFF} is locally-in-time solvable for the doubly critical case, i.e., $p=p_F$ and $\mu \in L^1({\bf R}^N)$.
  
    From the above, we are led to face the critical transition in the nature of equations \eqref{TFF} as $\alpha$ approaches $1-0$.

	\end{table}
	
	Nevertheless, since the Caputo derivative is believed to be a naturally generalized notion of the classical one, it would be reasonable to expect that problems \eqref{TFF} and \eqref{Fjt} should be correlated in a consistent way when $\alpha\to 1-0$. 

    Hence, our main concern here is stated as follows.
	\vskip\baselineskip
	
	\noindent\textbf{Question.} \textit{ Can one understand in a rigorous way the mechanism of
      the collapse of the global and local-in-time solvability of \eqref{TFF} 
        when $\alpha$ approaches $1-0$?}

	\vskip\baselineskip
	
	To give an affirmative answer to this question, in the first part of this paper, 
      we give an analogous version of the result of \cite{HisaIshige18} generalized to the time-fractional 
        case \eqref{TFF}. In particular, optimal (necessary and sufficient) conditions for the solvability of \eqref{TFF} are presented.
	The second part of this paper is devoted to the application of these results to 
      the analysis of the collapse phenomena. 
	    Through this procedure, the occurrence mechanism of the collapse of 
	      the global and local-in-time solvability of \eqref{TFF} is clarified.
	
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\subsection{Notation and the definition of solutions.}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	
	In order to state our main results, we fix some notations and formulate the definition of solutions. 
      
        Let $B(z;r):=\{y\in{\bf R}^N; |x-y|<r\}$ for $z\in{\bf R}^N$ and $r>0$. 
           In what follows, for a given Banach space $X$, 
             we denote its norm by $\| \cdot | X\|$.    
        For $t>0$ and $x\in{\bf R}^N$, let $G$ be the fundamental solution of the linear heat equation in $(0,\infty)\times{\bf R}^N$, that is
	\[
	G(t,x) := \frac{1}{(4\pi t)^\frac{N}{2}} \exp\left(-\frac{|x|^2}{4t}\right).
	\]
	For $t>0$, $x\in{\bf R}^N$, and a Radon measure $\mu$ on ${\bf R}^N$, define
	\[
	e^{t\Delta} \mu(x) := \int_{{\bf R}^N} G(t, x-y) \,d\mu(y).
	\]
	We often identify a locally integrable function $\phi$ defined on ${\bf R}^N$ with the Radon measure $\phi\,dx$. Let us define
	\[
	P_{\alpha}(t):= \int_0^\infty h_\alpha (\theta) e^{t^\alpha \theta \Delta} \, d\theta, \quad S_{\alpha} (t) := \int_0^\infty \theta h_\alpha (\theta ) e^{t^\alpha\theta \Delta} \, d\theta,
	\]
	for $t>0$ and $0<\alpha<1$. Here, $h_\alpha$ is a certain probability density function on $(0,\infty)$ which satisfies $h_\alpha>0$. In addition, we have
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:1.4}
	\int_0^\infty \theta^{\delta} h_\alpha(\theta) \, d\theta = \frac{\Gamma(1+\delta)}{\Gamma(1+\alpha\delta)}<\infty \quad \mbox{for} \quad \delta>-1
	\end{equation}
	and
	\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:1.4.5}
	\int_0^\infty h_\alpha (\theta ) e^{z\theta} \,d\theta = E_{\alpha,1} (z), \quad 
	\int_0^\infty \alpha \theta h_\alpha (\theta ) e^{z\theta} \,d\theta = E_{\alpha,\alpha} (z), 
	\quad \mbox{for} \quad z\in{\bf  C}.
	\end{equation}
	Here, $E_{\alpha,\beta}$ is the Mittag--Leffler function, that is, for $\alpha,\beta \in{\bf  C}$ with
	${\rm Re}(\alpha)>0$ and $z\in{\bf  C}$,
	\[
	E_{\alpha,\beta}(z) := \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{z^k}{\Gamma(\alpha k+ \beta)}.
	\]
	%
	For $a,b>0$, let $B(a,b)$ be the Beta function, that is
	\[
	B(a,b):= \int_0^1(1-s)^{a-1} s^{b-1}\,ds.
	\]
	
	Next, we formulate the definition of solutions of problem \eqref{TFF}. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%   Definition of solution   %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%	
In what follows, we denote $\nu \ge 0$ when $\nu$ is a nonnegative Radon measure.

	\begin{definition}
		\label{Def:1.1}
		Let $u$ be a nonnegative measurable function in $(0,T]\times{\bf R}^N$, where $0<T<\infty$. For given $\mu \ge 0$, we say that $u$ is a solution 
		of \eqref{TFF} in $[0,T]\times{\bf R}^N$ if u satisfies
		\[
		\infty> u(t,x) = [P_\alpha(t)\mu] (x) +\alpha\int_0^t (t-s)^{\alpha-1} [S_\alpha(t-s)u(s)^p](x) \,ds
		\]
		for almost all $t\in(0,T]$ and $x\in{\bf R}^N$.
		If $u$ satisfies the above equality with $=$ replaced by $\ge$, then $u$ is said to be a supersolution of \eqref{TFF} in $[0,T]\times{\bf R}^N$.
	\end{definition}
	%
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\subsection{Main results I(necessary and sufficient conditions)}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	Now we are ready to state the main results of this paper. The first theorem states necessary conditions for the existence of solutions of \eqref{TFF}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%    Theorem 1.1     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\begin{theorem}
		\label{Thm:1.1}
		Suppose that problem \eqref{TFF}  possesses a nonnegative solution in $[0,T]\times{\bf R}^N$, where $0<T<\infty$.
		Then there exists a constant $\gamma_1=\gamma_1(N,p,\alpha)>0$ satisfying $\limsup_{\alpha\to1-0} \gamma_1(\alpha)\in(0,\infty)$  such that $\mu$ satisfies
		\begin{equation}
		\label{Thm:1.1.1}
		\sup_{z\in{\bf R}^N} \mu(B(z;\sigma)) \le \gamma_1 \sigma^{N-\frac{2}{p-1}}
		\end{equation}
		for all $\sigma \in (0,T^{\alpha/2}]$.  In addition, if $p=p_F$, then there exists a constant $\gamma'_1=\gamma'_1(N,\alpha)>0$ satisfying $\limsup_{\alpha\to1-0} \gamma'_1(\alpha)\in(0,\infty)$  such that $\mu$ satisfies
		\begin{equation}
		\label{Thm:1.1.2}
		\sup_{z\in{\bf R}^N} \mu(B(z;\sigma)) \le \gamma'_1 \left(\int_{\sigma^{2/\alpha}/(16T)}^{1/4} t^{-\alpha} \, dt \right)^{-\frac{N}{2}}
		\end{equation}
		for all $\sigma \in (0,T^{\alpha/2}]$. 
	\end{theorem}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%    Remark 1.1      %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\begin{remark}
		{\rm 
			For the solvability of \eqref{Fjt}, the first author of this paper and Ishige \cite{HisaIshige18} proved the following optimal necessary conditions for the existence of nonnegative solutions:
			
 
 If problem \eqref{Fjt} possesses a nonnegative solution in $[0, T)\times{\bf R}^N$ for some $T>0$, then the following hold.
			\begin{enumerate}
				\item[(i)] \ There exists $C_1=C_1(N,p)>0$ such that
				\begin{equation}\label{eq. HisaIshige}
				\sup_{z\in{\bf R}^N} \mu(B(z;\sigma)) \le C_1 \sigma^{N-\frac{2}{p-1}},\quad 0<\sigma<T^\frac{1}{2}.
				\end{equation}
%%%%%%%				
				\item[(ii)] \  For the case $p=p_F$, there exists $C_2=C_2(N)>0$ such that
				\begin{equation}\label{eq. HisaIshige Pf}
				\sup_{z\in{\bf R}^N} \mu(B(z;\sigma)) \le C_2 \left[\log\left(e+\frac{T^\frac{1}{2}}{\sigma}\right)\right]^{-\frac{N}{2}},\quad 0<\sigma<T^\frac{1}{2}.
				\end{equation}
			\end{enumerate}
			See \cite[Theorem 1.1 (2)]{HisaIshige18} and we also refer to \cite{BarasPierre85}. 
  Obviously \eqref{Thm:1.1.1} is a generalization of \eqref{eq. HisaIshige}. 
    Moreover, taking the limit $\alpha\to1-0$ in \eqref{Thm:1.1.2}, we get
			\[
			\sup_{z\in{\bf R}^N} \mu(B(z;\sigma)) \le C\left(\log\frac{4T}{\sigma^2}\right)^{-\frac{N}{2}} \le C\left[\log\left(e+\frac{T^{\frac{1}{2}}}{\sigma}\right)\right]^{-\frac{N}{2}}
			\]
			for all $\sigma \in (0,T^{1/2}]$, which is the counterpart of \eqref{eq. HisaIshige Pf}. However, \eqref{Thm:1.1.2} gives not only an analogy to \eqref{eq. HisaIshige Pf} but also some information for the case $\alpha \in (0,1)$, which differs from the case $\alpha =1$. Namely, \eqref{Thm:1.1.2} does not exclude the case $T=\infty$ for suitable nontrivial initial data. In contrast, \eqref{eq. HisaIshige Pf} with $T=\infty$ implies $\mu \equiv 0$.

	Next, we give two types of sufficient conditions for the solvability of problem \eqref{TFF}.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

		Let $1<p\le p_F$ and $T>0$. Then there exists $\gamma_2=\gamma_2(N,p,\alpha)>0$ such that,

    \begin{enumerate}

   \begin{equation*}

    \end{equation*}

	\end{theorem}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%  Remark 1.3    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%	
	\begin{remark}
		\label{Rem:1.2}
		{\rm 
			Let $p=p_F$. It follows from Theorem~\ref{Thm:1.2} that if $\mu$ satisfies
			\[
			\mu({\bf R}^N)\le \gamma_2,
			\]
			then problem \eqref{TFF} possesses a global-in-time solution. As mentioned above, Zhang and Sun \cite{ZhanSun15} showed the global-in-time solvability of problem \eqref{TFF} with $p=p_F$ for appropriate initial data. We observe that Theorem~\ref{Thm:1.2} leads to the same conclusion as \cite{ZhanSun15}. For the local-in-time solvability, Ghergu, Miyamoto, and Suzuki \cite{GMS22} proved the existence of nonnegative solutions for arbitrary nonnegative $L^1$ initial values in the case of $p=p_F$. 
			Every  measurable function $f \in L^1({\bf R}^N)$ satisfies
			\[
			\lim_{R\to+0} \int_{B(z;R)} |f(y)| \, dy =0
			\]
			for all $z\in{\bf R}^N$. This together with Theorem~\ref{Thm:1.2} implies that for every nonnegative $f\in L^1({\bf R}^N)$, there exists  $T>0$ such that  problem \eqref{TFF} with $u(0)=f$  possesses a solution in $[0,T]\times{\bf R}^N$ in the case of $p=p_F$.
			Therefore, Theorem~\ref{Thm:1.2} leads to the same conclusion as \cite{GMS22}. See also \cite{OkaZhan23}.

	\subsection{Main results II(collapse of the solvability)} 
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	

	   As already mentioned above, for the critical case $p=p_F$, the collapse of the 
	    global and local-in-time solvability of \eqref{TFF} occurs when $\alpha$ approaches $1-0$.
	    
	    Here we first discuss the global-in-time solvability of problem \eqref{TFF} with $p=p_F$ as $\alpha\to 1-0$.
	  Let $\mathcal{M}$ be a set of Radon measures on ${\bf R}^N$ such that their norm satisfy $\|\nu|\mathcal{M}\|:=|\nu|({\bf R}^N) <\infty$, and for $r>0$, set
	\[
	\mathcal{B}^+(r):=\left\{ ~\! \nu\in\mathcal{M} ~\! ; ~\! \nu \geq 0, 
                                            \ \|\nu|\mathcal{M}\|\le r  ~\! \right\}.
	\]
	Define
	\[
	\mathcal{G}_\alpha:= \{ ~\!  \nu\in \mathcal{M} ~\! ; ~\!  \mbox{\eqref{TFF} with} ~\! u(0)=\nu \geq 0 
                                  \,\,\mbox{possesses a global-in-time solution.} ~\! \}.
	\]
	
	We recall that $\mathcal{G}_\alpha\neq \{0\}$ by Remark \ref{Rem:1.2}. The following result shows that the collapse of the global-in-time solvability of 
	   \eqref{TFF} occurs in such a way that $\mathcal{G}_{\alpha}$ shrinks to $\{0\}$ as $\alpha \to 1-0$. Moreover, the explicit estimate of the diameter of $\mathcal{G}_{\alpha}$ is given below. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%   Theorem 1.4      %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\begin{theorem}
		\label{Thm:4.1}
		Let $p=p_F$. Then there exist positive constants $C_1 \le C_2$ independent of $\alpha$ such that, near $\alpha =1$,
		\begin{equation}
		\label{Thm:4.1.1}
		\mathcal{B}^+\left( C_1(1-\alpha)^{\frac{N}{2}} \right)\subset \mathcal{G}_{\alpha}\subset \mathcal{B}^+\left( C_2(1-\alpha)^{\frac{N}{2}} \right).
		\end{equation}
	\end{theorem}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
  We next discuss the collapse of the local-in-time solvability of \eqref{TFF} for the doubly critical case, $p=p_F$ and $ \mu \in L^{1}({\bf R}^N)$. For specific considerations, we here focus on the following typical initial data.
	\begin{equation}\label{eq. intro Miyamoto init data}
	f_{\epsilon}(x) :=|x|^{-N} \left|\log |x| \right|^{-\frac{N}{2}-1+\epsilon}\chi_{B(0;1/e)} 
	   \in L^{1}({\bf R}^N) 
	    \quad \text{with} \ 0<\epsilon<N/2.
	\end{equation}
 In fact, \eqref{Fjt} with $p=p_F$ and initial data $u(0)=f_{\epsilon}$ admits no nonnegative local-in-time solutions. See \cite{Miya21, BarasPierre85, HisaIshige18}. Let $T_{\alpha}\left[\mu \right]$ be the life span of \eqref{TFF} with the initial data $\mu$. 
   Then, $T_{\alpha}\left[ f_{\epsilon}\right] >0$ by Remark \ref{Rem:1.2}. 
   
    The following result shows that the collapse of the local-in-time solvability of 
	   \eqref{TFF} occurs in such a way that $T_{\alpha}\left[ f_{\epsilon}\right]$ 
         converges to zero as $\alpha \to 1-0$ 
	     with the explicit convergence rate given below. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%   Theorem 1.5     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\begin{theorem}
		\label{Thm:4.2}
		Let $p=p_F$ and $0<\epsilon<N/2$. Then, there exists $C_1\le C_2$ such that, for each $\kappa>0$, there is $\alpha(\kappa,\epsilon)\in(0,1)$ such that for all $\alpha(\kappa,\epsilon)<\alpha<1$,
		\[
		C_1\kappa^{\frac{2}{N-2\epsilon}}(1-\alpha)^{-\frac{N}{N-2\epsilon}}\le -\log \left( T_{\alpha}[\kappa f_{\epsilon}] \right)\le C_2\kappa^{\frac{2}{N-2\epsilon}}(1-\alpha)^{-\frac{N}{N-2\epsilon}}.
		\]
		In particular, $\lim_{\alpha \to 1-0} T_{\alpha}[\kappa f_{\epsilon}] =0$ for all $\kappa>0$.
	\end{theorem}

	The rest of this paper is organized as follows.
	  In Section~\ref{section:Necessary condition}, we give a proof of Theorem~\ref{Thm:1.1},
        which is essentially based on the method of ordinary differential inequalities introduced 
           by \cite{LaiSie21} (see also \cite{FHIL23, HIT18}).
	  Theorems~\ref{Thm:1.2} and \ref{Thm:1.3} are proved in Section~\ref{section:Sufficient condition}. 
         When $\alpha=1$, Theorems~\ref{Thm:1.2} and \ref{Thm:1.3} coincide with 
           \cite[Theorems 1.3 and 1.4]{HisaIshige18} whose proofs rely on the supersolution method. 
      However, our argument is totally different from theirs. 
       Instead, we introduce the uniformly local $L^q$ space and the local Morrey space $M^{q,\lambda}$ 
         and apply the contraction mapping principle in these spaces. 
	 In Section~\ref{section. Collapse of the solvability}, we give proofs of 
       Theorems~\ref{Thm:4.1} and \ref{Thm:4.2}.
	 Section~\ref{section:Application} is devoted to some further applications of 
       our results to life span estimates for some specialized initial data.

	\section{Necessary conditions for the solvability.}\label{section:Necessary condition}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	In this section, we give a proof of Theorem~\ref{Thm:1.1}. We follow the argument \cite{FHIL23,HisaIshige18,LaiSie21} in which an inequality related to
	\[
	\int_{{\bf R}^N} G(t^\alpha,x) u(t,x) \,dx.
	\]
	is essential.
	
	\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{Thm:1.1}]
		Suppose that $0<\rho\le (16^{-1}T)^{\alpha/2}$. Let $\overline{z} \in {\bf R}^N$ and $\overline{T}\in (T/4, T/2)$ be such that
		\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:3.1}
		\begin{split}
		\infty &> u(2\overline{T}, \overline{z} ) \\
		&\ge \alpha \int_0^{2\overline{T}} (2\overline{T}-s)^{\alpha-1}\int_0^\infty\theta h_\alpha(\theta)\\
		&\qquad\qquad\qquad\times\int_{{\bf R}^N} G((2\overline{T}-s)^\alpha \theta, \overline{z} -y) u(s,y)^p \, dyd\theta ds.
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}
		Set
		\begin{equation*}
		U(t):= \int_{{\bf R}^N} G(t^\alpha,x)u(t,x+\overline{z}) \,dx.
		\end{equation*}
		
		\noindent\textbf{Step 1.} First, we prove $U(t) <\infty $ for almost all $t\in (\rho^{2/\alpha},T/4]$.
		Application of the Jensen inequality to \eqref{eq:3.1} yields
		\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:3.2}
		\begin{split}
		\infty &> u( 2\overline{T}, \overline{z}) \\
		& \ge C \alpha \overline{T}^{\alpha-1} \int_{\rho^{2/\alpha}}^{2\overline{T}} \int_{1}^{\infty}  h_\alpha(\theta)\int_{{\bf R}^N} G((2\overline{T}-s)^\alpha \theta,y) u(s,y+\overline{z})^p \, dyd\theta ds\\
		& \ge C \alpha \overline{T}^{\alpha-1} \int_{\rho^{2/\alpha}}^{\overline{T}} \int_{1}^{\infty} h_\alpha(\theta)\left(\int_{{\bf R}^N} G((2\overline{T}-s)^\alpha \theta,y) u(s,y+\overline{z}) \, dy\right)^p d\theta ds.
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}
		Since $s\le 2\overline{T}-s\le T$ for $0<s<\overline{T}(<T/2)$, we have
		\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:3.3}
		\begin{split}
		G((2\overline{T}-s)^\alpha \theta,y) 
		&= \frac{1}{(4\pi (2\overline{T}-s)^\alpha \theta)^{\frac{N}{2}} }\exp\left(-\frac{|y|^2}{4(2\overline{T}-s)^\alpha \theta}\right)\\
		&\ge \frac{1}{\theta^\frac{N}{2}}\left( \frac{s}{2\overline{T}-s}\right)^\frac{N\alpha}{2}\frac{1}{(4\pi s^\alpha )^{\frac{N}{2}} }\exp\left(-\frac{|y|^2}{4s^\alpha}\right)\\
		&\ge \frac{C\rho^N}{\theta^\frac{N}{2}T^\frac{N\alpha}{2}}G(s^\alpha,y)\\
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}
		for all $y\in{\bf R}^N$ and $s\in(\rho^{2/\alpha}, \overline{T})$.
		Combining \eqref{eq:3.2} and \eqref{eq:3.3}, we see that there exists a constant 
		$C_*=C_*(N,\alpha, p, \rho, T)>0$ such that
		\begin{equation*}
		\begin{split}
		\infty >  u(2\overline{T},\overline{z} )  &\ge C_* \int_{1}^{\infty} \theta^{-\frac{N}{2}}h_{\alpha}(\theta)d\theta \int_{\rho^{2/\alpha}}^{\overline{T}} U(s)^p \,ds\ge C_* \int_{\rho^{2/\alpha}}^{T/4} U(s)^p \,ds.
		\end{split}
		\end{equation*}
		This implies that $U(t)<\infty$ for almost all $t\in (\rho^{2/\alpha},T/4]$. Note that
		\[
		\infty>\int_{1}^{\infty} \theta^{-\frac{N}{2}} h_{\alpha}(\theta)d\theta>0.
		\]
		
		\noindent\textbf{Step 2.} For $\overline{z}\in{\bf R}^N$ and $t\in(\rho^{2/\alpha},T/4]$, set
		\begin{equation*}
		V(t):= t^\frac{N\alpha}{2}U(t), \qquad M:= \mu(B(\overline{z};\rho)).
		\end{equation*}
		%
		Here we claim that
		\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:3.4}
		\begin{split}
		\infty>V(t) 
		&\ge C_1r_1(\alpha) M+	C_2 r_2(\alpha)T^{\alpha-1}\int_{\rho^{2/\alpha}}^t s^{-\frac{N\alpha}{2}(p-1)} V(s)^p \,ds
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}
		%
		for  almost all $t \in(\rho^{2/\alpha},T/4]$, where
		\[
		r_1(\alpha) = E_{\alpha,1} \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)>0, \quad r_2(\alpha) =\alpha E_{\alpha,\alpha}  \left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)>0, 
		\]
		and $C_1, C_2$ are positive constants depending only on $N$ and $p$.
		By the definition of $E_{\alpha,\beta}(z)$, we see easily that
		\[
		\limsup_{\alpha\to1-0} r_i(\alpha) \in (0,\infty)
		\]
		for $i=1,2$. By Definition \ref{Def:1.1}, we have
		\begin{equation*}
		\begin{split}
		u(t,x+\overline{z}) 
		&= \int_0^\infty \int_{{\bf R}^N}h_\alpha(\theta) G(t^\alpha\theta, x+\overline{z}-y)\,d\mu(y)d\theta\\
		& +\alpha \int_0^t(t-s)^{\alpha-1} [S_\alpha (t-s) u(s)^p](x+\overline{z}) \, ds
		\end{split}
		\end{equation*}
		for almost all $t\in(\rho^{2/\alpha},T/4]$ and $x\in{\bf R}^N$.
		Multiplying $G(t^\alpha, x)$ by both side and integrating with respect to $x$, we obtain
		\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:2.5}
		\begin{split}
		\infty>U(t) &
		= \int_{{\bf R}^N} \left[\int_0^\infty h_\alpha (\theta) \left(\int_{{\bf R}^N} G(t^\alpha \theta, x+\overline{z}-y)G(t^\alpha,x)\,dx\right)\,d\theta\right]\,d\mu(y)\\
		&+\alpha \int_{{\bf R}^N} G(t^\alpha, x) \left(\int_0^t(t-s)^{\alpha-1}[S_\alpha(t-s)u(s)^p](x+z)\,ds\right)\,dx\\
		&=: I_1 + \alpha I_2
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}
		for almost all $t\in(\rho^{2/\alpha},T/4]$.
		For $I_1$, from the semigroup property of the heat kernel $G$, we deduce
		\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:2.6}
		\begin{split}
		I_1&= \int_{{\bf R}^N}\int_0^\infty h_\alpha (\theta) G(t^\alpha(1+\theta),\overline{z}-y)\,d\theta d\mu(y)\\
		&\ge C \left(\int_0^\infty h_\alpha (\theta) (1+\theta)^{-\frac{N}{2}}\, d\theta\right) t^{-\frac{N\alpha}{2}} \int_{B(\overline{z};\rho)} \exp\left(-\frac{|\overline{z}-y|^2}{4t^\alpha}\right) d\mu(y)\\
		&\ge C \left(\int_0^\infty h_\alpha (\theta) (1+\theta)^{-\frac{N}{2}}\,d\theta\right) t^{-\frac{N\alpha}{2}} M
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}
		for almost all $t\in(\rho^{2/\alpha},T/4]$.
		For $I_2$, we similarly use the semigroup property to get
		\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:2.7}
		\begin{split}
		I_2 = \int_0^t (t-s)^{\alpha-1} \int_{{\bf R}^N}\int_0^\infty \theta h_\alpha(\theta) G(t^\alpha+(t-s)^\alpha\theta, \overline{z}-y)u(s,y)^p\, d\theta dyds.
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}
		%
		Since $t>s$, we have
		\begin{equation*}
		\begin{split}
		&\exp\left(-\frac{|y-\overline{z}|^2}{4t^\alpha + 4(t-s)^\alpha \theta}\right) \ge \exp\left(-\frac{|y-\overline{z}|^2}{4s^\alpha}\right),\\
		&t^\alpha + (t-s)^\alpha \theta \le t^\alpha(1+\theta) = s^\alpha \left(\frac{t}{s}\right)^\alpha (1+\theta).
		\end{split}
		\end{equation*}
		This together with \eqref{eq:2.5}, \eqref{eq:2.6}, \eqref{eq:2.7}, and the Jensen inequality implies that
		\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:2.8}
		\begin{split}
		\infty>U(t) &\ge C_1 \left(\int_0^\infty h_\alpha (\theta) (1+\theta)^{-\frac{N}{2}} \, d\theta \right) t^{-\frac{N\alpha}{2}}M\\
		& + C_2\alpha  T^{\alpha-1} \left(\int_{0}^\infty \theta h_\alpha(\theta) (1+\theta)^{-\frac{N}{2}}\,d\theta\right) t^{-\frac{N\alpha}{2}} \int_{\rho^{2/\alpha}}^t s^{\frac{N\alpha}{2}} U(s)^p\,ds
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}
		for almost all $t\in(\rho^{2/\alpha},T/4]$.
		Since the function $\theta \mapsto e^{-\theta/2}(1+\theta)^{N/2}$ is bounded on $[0,\infty)$, we use \eqref{eq:1.4.5} to deduce 
		\begin{equation*}
		\begin{split}
		&\int_0^\infty h_\alpha (\theta) (1+\theta)^{-\frac{N}{2}} \, d\theta \ge \int_0^\infty h_\alpha (\theta) e^{-\frac{\theta}{2}} \, d\theta = E_{\alpha,1}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = r_1(\alpha),\\
		&\alpha \int_{0}^\infty \theta h_\alpha(\theta) (1+\theta)^{-\frac{N}{2}}\,d\theta \ge \alpha \int_0^\infty \theta h_\alpha (\theta) e^{-\frac{\theta}{2}} \, d\theta = \alpha E_{\alpha,\alpha}\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right) = r_2(\alpha).\\
		\end{split}
		\end{equation*}
		Therefore \eqref{eq:2.8} yields \eqref{eq:3.4}.
		
		\noindent\textbf{Step 3.} We may then let $\zeta$ denote the unique local solution of the integral equation
		\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:3.5}
		\zeta(t) = C_1r_1(\alpha) M+	C_2 r_2(\alpha)T^{\alpha-1}\int_{\rho^{2/\alpha}}^t s^{-\frac{N\alpha}{2}(p-1)} \zeta(s)^p \,ds
		\end{equation}
		%
		for all $t \in(\rho^{2/\alpha},T/4]$. 
		Hence, $\zeta$ is the unique local solution of 
		\begin{equation*}
		\zeta'(t) = C_2 r_2(\alpha) T^{\alpha-1}t^{-\frac{N\alpha}{2}(p-1)} \zeta(t)^p, \qquad \zeta(\rho^\frac{2}{\alpha}) = C_1r_1(\alpha) M.
		\end{equation*}
		%
		By \eqref{eq:3.4}, applying the standard theory for ordinary differential equations to \eqref{eq:3.5},
		we see that the solution $\zeta$ exists in $[\rho^{2/\alpha}, T/4]$.
		It is easy to solve this ordinary differential equation and get
		\[
		C_2r_2(\alpha) T^{\alpha-1} \int_{\rho^{2/\alpha}}^{T/4} t^{-\frac{N\alpha}{2}(p-1)} \, dt = \int_{\zeta(\rho^{2/\alpha})}^{\zeta(T/4)} \zeta^{-p}\,d\zeta 
		\le \int_{\zeta(\rho^{2/\alpha})}^{\infty} \zeta^{-p}\,d\zeta. 
		\]
		This implies that
		\[
		\mu(B(\overline{z};\rho))=M\le \frac{C}{r_1(\alpha) r_2(\alpha)^\frac{1}{p-1}} T^{-\frac{\alpha-1}{p-1}} \left(\int_{\rho^{2/\alpha}}^{T/4} t^{-\frac{N\alpha}{2}(p-1)} \, dt \right)^{-\frac{1}{p-1}}
		\]
		for all  $\rho\in (0, (T/4)^{\alpha/2}]$. 
		Setting $\sigma:= 4^\alpha \rho$, we obtain
		\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:3.6}
		\mu(B(\overline{z};4^{-\alpha}\sigma)) \le \frac{C}{r_1(\alpha) r_2(\alpha)^\frac{1}{p-1}} T^{-\frac{\alpha-1}{p-1}} \left(\int_{\sigma^{2/\alpha}/16}^{T/4} t^{-\frac{N\alpha}{2}(p-1)} \, dt \right)^{-\frac{1}{p-1}}
		\end{equation}
		for all $\sigma \in (0,T^{\alpha/2}]$. 
		Let $z\in{\bf R}^N$.
		Then we can take integer $m=m(N,\alpha)$ satisfying $\limsup_{\alpha\to1-0} m(\alpha)<\infty$,
		and $\{\overline{z}_i\}_{i=1}^m\subset {\bf R}^N$  satisfying \eqref{eq:3.6} such that 
		\begin{equation*}
		\begin{split}
		\mu(B(z;\sigma)) 
		&\le \sum_{i=1}^m \mu(B(\overline{z}_i;4^{-\alpha}\sigma)) \\
		&\le \frac{Cm}{r_1(\alpha) r_2(\alpha)^\frac{1}{p-1}} T^{-\frac{\alpha-1}{p-1}} \left(\int_{\sigma^{2/\alpha}/16}^{T/4} t^{-\frac{N\alpha}{2}(p-1)} \, dt \right)^{-\frac{1}{p-1}}
		\end{split}
		\end{equation*}
		for all $\sigma \in (0,T^{\alpha/2}]$. 
		Since $z\in{\bf R}^N$ is arbitrary, we obtain \eqref{Thm:1.1.2}.
		Furthermore, applying the above argument with $T = \sigma^{2/\alpha}$, we obtain \eqref{Thm:1.1.1}.
	\end{proof}

	\subsection{Preliminaries.}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	Oka and Zhanpeisov \cite{OkaZhan23} already constructed the theory of solvability of \eqref{TFF} in the Besov-Morrey space framework. However, in order to make this paper self-contained, and exhibit the estimate of the existence time, we discuss the solvability of \eqref{TFF} in the Morrey framework here. In order to prove Theorem~\ref{Thm:1.2},
	we introduce the uniformly local  $L^q$ space.
	For details, see e.g. \cite{MaeTera06, FujiIoku18, QuitSoup19}. 
	\begin{definition}
	Let $L^p_{uloc}=L^p_{uloc}({\bf R}^N)$ {\rm ( $1\le p\le\infty$ )} 
          be the set of all measurable functions $f$ 
            defined on ${\bf R}^N$ such that
		\[
		\|f|L^p_{uloc}\| := \sup_{z\in{\bf R}^N} \|f|L^p(B(z;1))\|<\infty.
		\]
	\end{definition}
	 We note that $L^p_{uloc}({\bf R}^N)$ with norm $\|\cdot|L^p_{uloc}\|$ forms a Banach space. 
	   Furthermore, $M^1=M^1({\bf R}^N)$ is defined as the set of all Radon measures
          $\mu$ on ${\bf R}^N$ such that
	\[
	\|\mu|M^1\| := \sup_{z\in{\bf R}^N} |\mu|(B(z;1)) <\infty,
	\]
	where $|\mu|$ is the total variation of $\mu$. 
	To prove Theorem~\ref{Thm:1.2}, we heavily rely on the following proposition. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%   Proposition 3.1     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\begin{proposition}
		\label{LpLq} 
		Let $1\le q \le p \le\infty$. One has 
		\begin{equation*}
		\|e^{t\Delta} \mu|L^p_{uloc}\| \le C\left(1+t^{-\frac{N}{2}(\frac{1}{q}-\frac{1}{p})}\right) \|\mu|L^q_{uloc}\|
		\end{equation*}
		for $\mu\in L^{q}_{loc}({\bf R}^N)$ and $t>0$. In particular, if $q=1$, one has
		\begin{equation*}
		\|e^{t\Delta} \mu|L^p_{uloc}\| \le C\left(1+t^{-\frac{N}{2}(1- \frac{1}{p})}\right) \|\mu|M^1\|
		\end{equation*}
		for $\mu\in M^1({\bf R}^N)$ and $t>0$. 
	\end{proposition}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\begin{proof}
		The first estimate is proved by \cite[Theorem 3.1]{MaeTera06}.
		We can prove the second one in the same way with  $q=1$ and $dy=d\mu(y)$. Indeed, by using the same notation as in the proof of \cite[Theorem 3.1]{MaeTera06}, the key estimates are equations (3.13) and (3.14) in \cite[page 382]{MaeTera06} which are summarized as follows:
		\[
		\begin{aligned}
		&\left\| H_{t,0}\ast \mu | L^p\left( S\left( k,1/2 \right) \right) \right\|\\
		&\le\left\| \sum_{k',k''\in \textbf{Z}^N} \left( \chi_{S\left( k',1/2 \right)}H_{t,0} \ast \left( \chi_{S\left( k'',1/2 \right)}\mu \right) \right)  |L^p\left( S\left( k,1/2 \right) \right)\right\|\\
		&\le \sum_{k'\in \textbf{Z}^N} 3^N \left\| \chi_{S\left( k',1/2 \right)}H_{t,0} |L^p\right\| \sup_{k''\in \textbf{Z}^N} |\mu|\left( S\left( k'',1/2 \right) \right) 
		\end{aligned}
		\]
		where
		\[
		\left\| H_{t,0}\ast \mu | L^p\left( S\left( k,1/2 \right) \right) \right\|\ \text{and}\ \sup_{k''\in \textbf{Z}^N} |\mu|\left( S\left( k,1/2 \right) \right) 
		\]
		coincides with $\|e^{t\Delta} \mu|L^p_{uloc}\|$ and $\| \mu | M^1\|$ respectively. For $p=1$ and $p=\infty$, we can justify the above estimate for $\mu \in M^1(\textbf{R}^N)$. For general $p\in (1,\infty)$, we use the interpolation argument.

	Next, we prepare two lemmas to prove Proposition \ref{MpMq}, which have been proved by Kozono--Yamazaki \cite[Theorem 2.5, Proposition 2.11, and Theorem 3.1]{KozoYama94}.

		N^{s}_{p',q',r} \hookrightarrow N^{s-\frac{N}{p'}(1-\theta)}_{\frac{p'}{\theta}, \frac{q'}{\theta}, r},
		\end{equation}
		\begin{equation}
		\label{em2}
		N^{0}_{p',q',1} \hookrightarrow M^{q', \frac{q'N}{p'}} \hookrightarrow N^{0}_{p',q',\infty}.
		\end{equation}
	\end{lemma}
	
	\begin{lemma}
		Let $s<\sigma$ and $1\le q' \le p' <\infty$. Then there exists a constant $C>0$ such that
		\begin{equation}
		\label{smooth}
		\|e^{t\Delta} f|{N^\sigma_{p',q',1}}\| \le C (1+t^{\frac{s-\sigma}{2}}) \|f|{N^s_{p',q',\infty}}\|
		\end{equation}
		for all $f\in N^s_{p',q',\infty} $ and $t>0$.
	\end{lemma}
	
	\begin{proof}[Proof of Proposition \ref{MpMq}.]
		First, we prove \eqref{MPMQ1} in the case of $p=q$.
		Let $\mu \in M^{p,\lambda}$, $z\in {\bf R}^N$, and $R\in(0,1]$. 
		By the Jensen inequality, we have 
		\begin{equation*}
		\begin{split}
		\int_{B(z;R)} |e^{t\Delta} \mu (x)|^p\, dx
		& = \int_{B(z;R)}\left|\int_{{\bf R}^N} G(x-y,t) \mu(y)\,dy\right|^p\, dx\\
		& \le\int_{B(z;R)} \int_{{\bf R}^N} G(x-y,t) |\mu(y)|^p\,dydx\\
		& =   \int_{B(z;R)}\int_{{\bf R}^N} G(y,t) |\mu(x-y)|^p\,dydx\\
		&= \int_{{\bf R}^N} G(y,t) \int_{B(z;R)}|\mu(x-y)|^p\,dxdy\\
		&\le R^{N-\lambda} \|\mu|M^{p,\lambda}\|^p \int_{{\bf R}^N} G(y,t)\,dy\\
		&=  R^{N-\lambda} \|\mu|M^{p,\lambda}\|^p.
		\end{split}
		\end{equation*}
		Since $z\in{\bf R}^N$ and $R\in(0,1]$ are arbitrary, we have
		\[
		\|e^{t\Delta} \mu (x)|M^{p,\lambda}\| \le  \|\mu|M^{p,\lambda}\|,
		\]
		whence follows \eqref{MPMQ1} with $p=q$.
		
		
		
		Next, we prove \eqref{MPMQ1} with $p>q$.
		By \eqref{em2}  with 
		\[
		p'= \frac{pN}{\lambda} \quad \mbox{and} \quad q' = p,
		\]
		%($A\to B$ means "substituting $B$ into $A$"),
		we have 
		\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:em4}
		\begin{split}
		\|e^{t\Delta} \mu|M^{p,\lambda}\|
		& \le C \left\|e^{t\Delta} \mu |{N^0_{\frac{pN}{\lambda}, p,1}}\right\|\\
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}
		for all $t>0$. Note that
		\[
		N^{0}_{\frac{pN}{\lambda}, p,1} = 
		N^{N(1-\frac{q}{p})\frac{\lambda}{qN}-N(1-\frac{q}{p})\frac{\lambda}{qN}}_{\frac{qN}{\lambda}\frac{p}{q}, q \frac{p}{q},1}.
		\]
		By \eqref{em1} with
		\[
		\theta = \frac{q}{p}\in(0,1), \quad p'=\frac{qN}{\lambda}, \quad q'= q, \quad r=1,\quad s=N\left(1-\frac{q}{p}\right)\frac{\lambda}{qN},
		\]
		we have
		\begin{equation}
		\label{eq:em5}
		\left\|e^{t\Delta} \mu|{N^0_{\frac{pN}{\lambda}, p,1}}\right\| \le C \left\|e^{t\Delta} \mu|{N^{\lambda(\frac{1}{q}-\frac{1}{p})}_{\frac{qN}{\lambda}, q,1}}\right\|
		\end{equation}
		for all $t>0$.
		By  \eqref{em2} and \eqref{smooth} with 
		\[
		p'= \frac{qN}{\lambda}, \quad q'= q, \quad r=\infty, \quad s=0, \quad \sigma = \lambda\left(\frac{1}{q}-\frac{1}{p}\right)>0,
		\]
		\eqref{eq:em4}, and \eqref{eq:em5}, we have 
		\begin{equation*}
		%\label{eq:3.5}
		\begin{split}
		\|e^{t\Delta} \mu|M^{p,\lambda}\| \le C  \left\|e^{t\Delta} \mu|{N^{\lambda(\frac{1}{q}-\frac{1}{p})}_{\frac{qN}{\lambda}, q,1}}\right\|
		&\le C (1+t^{-\frac{\lambda}{2}(\frac{1}{q}-\frac{1}{p})})\left\| \mu|{N^{0}_{\frac{qN}{\lambda}, q,\infty}}\right\|\\
		&\le C (1+t^{-\frac{\lambda}{2}(\frac{1}{q}-\frac{1}{p})})\| \mu|M^{q,\lambda}\|\\
		\end{split}
		\end{equation*}
		for all $t>0$. Thus we arrive at \eqref{MPMQ1}.

	%Let $1\le r \le q <\infty$. One has 
	%\begin{equation*}
	%\|e^{t\Delta} \mu\|_{M^q} \le C t^{-\frac{N}{2}(\frac{1}{r}-\frac{1}{q})} \|\mu\|_{M^r},
	%\end{equation*}
	%for $\mu\in M^{q}({\bf R}^N)$ and $t>0$.
	%\end{proposition}
	%\begin{proof}
	%
	%\end{proof}
	In this subsection, we give a proof of Theorem~\ref{Thm:1.2}. 
	\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{Thm:1.2}.]
		It suffices to consider the case of $T=1$. Indeed, for any solution $u$ of \eqref{TFF} in $[0,T]\times{\bf R}^N$, where $0<T<\infty$, we see that $u_\lambda (x,t) := \lambda^{2\alpha/(p-1)}u(\lambda^2 t , \lambda^\alpha x)$ with $\lambda:= \sqrt{T}$ is a solution of \eqref{TFF} in $[0,1]\times{\bf R}^N$.
		The proof is based on the contraction mapping theorem.
		Since $1<p\le p_F$, note ${N(p-1)/2}\le1$.
		Then \eqref{Thm:1.2.1} reads
		\[
		\sup_{z\in{\bf R}^N}\mu(B(z;1))\le \gamma_2,
		\]
		where $\gamma_2$ is the constant as in Theorem~\ref{Thm:1.2}.
		Set
		\[X :=L^\infty((0,1);L^{p}_{uloc}({\bf R}^N))
		\]
		and
		\[
		\|u|X\|:= \sup_{t\in(0,1)} t^\beta \|u(t)|L^p_{uloc}\|, \quad \beta := \frac{N\alpha}{2p}(p-1) \le \frac{\alpha}{p}.
		\]
		For $u\in X$, define
		\[
		\Phi[u](t):= P_\alpha(t)\mu +\alpha\int_0^t (t-s)^{\alpha-1} S_\alpha(t-s)|u(s)|^p \,ds.
		\]
		Denote $B_M := \{u\in X;\|u|X\|\le M\}$ for $M>0$, which will be fixed later, and set 
		\[
		d(u,v) := \|u-v|X\|  \qquad \forall u, v \in B_M,
		\]
		 then $(B_M,d)$ becomes a complete metric space.
		   We are going to show below that $\Phi$ maps $B_M$ into itself for all $t \in (0,1)$.
		   
           Take any $u\in B_M$ and $t\in (0,1)$, then since
		\[
		-\frac{N}{2}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)>-1
		\]
		for $1<p\le p_F$, \eqref{eq:1.4} yields
		\[
		\int_0^\infty h_\alpha(\theta) (1+\theta^{-\frac{N}{2}(1-\frac{1}{p})} )\, d\theta= 1+\frac{\Gamma\left(1-\frac{N}{2}(1-\frac{1}{p})\right)}{\Gamma\left(1-\frac{N\alpha}{2}(1-\frac{1}{p})\right)} <\infty
		\]
		and
		\[
		\int_0^\infty h_\alpha(\theta) (\theta+\theta^{1-\frac{N}{2}(1-\frac{1}{p})} )\, d\theta=\frac{\Gamma\left(2\right)}{\Gamma\left(1+\alpha\right)}+\frac{\Gamma\left(2-\frac{N}{2}(1-\frac{1}{p})\right)}{\Gamma\left(1+\alpha-\frac{N\alpha}{2}(1-\frac{1}{p})\right)} <\infty.
		\]
		Note that the constants above are uniformly bounded near $\alpha=1$, and that $\|f^p|L^1_{uloc}\| =\|f|L^p_{uloc}\|^p$ for all $f\in L^p_{uloc}({\bf R}^N)$.
		It follows from Proposition \ref{LpLq} and \eqref{Thm:1.2.1} that
		\begin{equation*}
		\begin{split}
		t^\beta \|P_\alpha (t) \mu |L^p_{uloc}\| 
		&\le t^\beta \int_0^\infty h_\alpha(\theta) \|e^{t^\alpha \theta \Delta}\mu|L^p_{uloc}\| \, d\theta\\
		&\le C \|\mu|M^1\|t^\beta\int_0^\infty h_\alpha(\theta )(1+(t^\alpha \theta)^{-\frac{N}{2}(1-\frac{1}{p})})\, d\theta \\
		&\le C\|\mu|M^1\|t^{\beta-\frac{N\alpha}{2}(1-\frac{1}{p})} \int_0^\infty h_\alpha(\theta )(1+\theta^{-\frac{N}{2}(1-\frac{1}{p})})\, d\theta \\
		&\le C_1 \gamma_2
		\end{split}
		\end{equation*}
		%
		for $0<t\le1$. Similarly,
		\begin{equation*}
		\begin{split}
		&t^\beta \left\| \alpha\int_0^t (t-s)^{\alpha-1} S_\alpha(t)|u(s)|^p\,ds |L^p_{uloc}\right\| \\
		&\le \alpha t^\beta \int_0^t (t-s)^{\alpha-1} \|S_\alpha(t)|u(s)|^p|L^p_{uloc}\|\,ds \\
		&\le C  t^\beta  \int_0^t (t-s)^{\alpha-1} \int_0^\infty \theta h_\alpha(\theta) (1+[(t-s)^\alpha \theta]^{-\frac{N}{2}(1-\frac{1}{p})})\||u(s)|^p|L^1_{uloc}\| \,d\theta ds\\
		&\le CM^pt^{\alpha(1-\frac{N}{2}(p-1))} B\left(\alpha-\frac{N\alpha}{2}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right), 1-\frac{N\alpha}{2}(p-1)\right)\\
		&\le C_2M^pB\left(\alpha-\frac{N\alpha}{2}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right), 1-\frac{N\alpha}{2}(p-1)\right)
		\end{split}
		\end{equation*}
		for $0<t\le1$.  
		Note that $C_1$ and $C_2$ are independent of $\alpha$. Set
		\begin{equation}\label{gamma_2}
		\gamma_2= c_* B\left(\alpha-\frac{N\alpha}{2}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right), 1-\frac{N\alpha}{2}(p-1)\right)^{-\frac{1}{p-1}}
		\end{equation}
		and
		\[
		M= 2C_1 c_*B\left(\alpha-\frac{N\alpha}{2}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right), 1-\frac{N\alpha}{2}(p-1)\right)^{-\frac{1}{p-1}},
		\]
		where $c_*>0$. 
		Taking sufficiently small $c_*>0$ if necessary, we have by the above inequalities
		\begin{equation*}
		%\label{sub:2}
		\begin{split}
		\|\Phi[u]|X\| 
		&= \sup_{t\in(0,1)} t^\beta\|\Phi[u](t)|L^p_{uloc}\| \\
		&\le (C_1c_*+ 2^pC_1^pC_2c_*^p)B\left(\alpha-\frac{N\alpha}{2}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right), 1-\frac{N\alpha}{2}(p-1)\right)^{-\frac{1}{p-1}} \\
		&\le 2C_1c_*B\left(\alpha-\frac{N\alpha}{2}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right), 1-\frac{N\alpha}{2}(p-1)\right)^{-\frac{1}{p-1}} = M.
		\end{split}
		\end{equation*}
		This implies that $\Phi: B_M \to B_M$. 
		
		Next, we show that $\Phi: B_M \to B_M$ is a contraction mapping. 
		Take any $u,v\in B_M$, then by manipulations similar to those above, we have
		\begin{equation}
		\label{sub:4}
		\begin{split}
		& t^\beta \|\Phi[u](t)-\Phi[v](t)|L^p_{uloc}\|\\
		&\le \alpha t^\beta \int_0^t (t-s)^{\alpha-1} \int_0^\infty \theta h_\alpha(\theta) \|e^{(t-s)^\alpha \theta \Delta}(|u(s)|^p-|v(s)|^p)|L^p_{uloc}\| \, d\theta ds\\
		&\le  C t^\beta \int_0^t (t-s)^{\alpha-1-\frac{N\alpha}{2}(1-\frac{1}{p})}  \||u(s)|^p-|v(s)|^p|L^1_{uloc}\| \, ds\\
		&\qquad\qquad\qquad\times \int_0^\infty  h_\alpha(\theta)(\theta+ \theta^{1-\frac{N}{2}(1-\frac{1}{p})}) \,d\theta\\
		&\le  C t^\beta \int_0^t (t-s)^{\alpha-1-\frac{N\alpha}{2}(1-\frac{1}{p})}  (\|u(s)|L^p_{uloc}\|^{p-1} + \|v(s)|L^p_{uloc}\|^{p-1})\\
		&\qquad\qquad\qquad\times \|u(s)-v(s)|L^p_{uloc}\| \, ds\\
		&\le  C t^\beta  M^{p-1}\int_0^t (t-s)^{\alpha-1-\frac{N\alpha}{2}(1-\frac{1}{p})} s^{-p\beta}\, ds \, d(u,v)\\
		&\le C_3M^{p-1}t^{\alpha(1-\frac{N}{2}(p-1))}B\left(\alpha-\frac{N\alpha}{2}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right), 1-\frac{N\alpha}{2}(p-1)\right)d(u,v)
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}
		for $0<t\le1$. Note that $C_3$ is independent of $\alpha$. 
		Taking sufficiently small $c_*>0$ if necessary, we have by \eqref{sub:4}
		\[
		d(\Phi[u], \Phi[v]) \le 2^{p-1} C_1^{p-1}C_3 c_*^{p-1} d(u,v) \le \frac{1}{2} d(u,v)
		\] 
		for $u,v\in B_M$. Note that $c_*$ is independent of $\alpha$.
		This implies that $\Phi: B_M \to B_M$ is a contraction mapping. 
		Therefore, by the contraction mapping theorem, we know $\Phi$ has a unique fixed point $u\in B_M$. 
		Obviously, if $\mu$ is a nonnegative Radon measure on ${\bf R}^N$, we see that $u(x,t)\ge0$ for almost all $t\in(0,1]$ and $x\in{\bf R}^N$.
		This implies that $u$ is a nonnegative solution of \eqref{TFF} in $[0,1]\times{\bf R}^N$. Furthermore \eqref{est:gamma2:sub} easily follows from \eqref{gamma_2}.
		
		Finally, let $p=p_F$. By the property of the Beta function:
		\[
		B(x,y)=\frac{\Gamma(x)\Gamma(y)}{\Gamma(x+y)}
		\]
		and the Gamma function:
		\[
		\Gamma(1+x)=x\Gamma(x),
		\]
		we can take $C>0$ independently of $\alpha$ such that
		\[
		B\left( \alpha -\frac{N\alpha}{2}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right), 1-\alpha \right)=C \Gamma(1-\alpha)=C(1-\alpha)^{-1}, 
		\]
		which together with \eqref{gamma_2} and $p=p_F$ yields 
           \eqref{est:gamma2:critical}. 
	\end{proof}

	\subsection{ Proof of Theorem \ref{Thm:1.3}.}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	 Here we give a proof of Theorem~\ref{Thm:1.3}. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%   Proof of Theorem 1.3.     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%	
	\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{Thm:1.3}.]
		It suffices to consider the case of $T=1$. Hence, in view of \eqref{def:Morrey}, we see that \eqref{Thm:1.3.1} is equivalent to
		\begin{equation}\label{super:1}
		\|\mu|M^{r,\lambda}\|\le \gamma_3 \qquad \lambda := {2r/(p-1)}.
		\end{equation}
    For simplicity of notation, set
		$|\cdot|_{r} := \|\cdot|M^{r,\lambda}\|$ for $r\ge 1$.
		Let $1<r<q<\infty$ be such that
		\[
		1<\frac{q}{p}<r<q \quad \mbox{and} \quad \lambda =\frac{2r}{p-1} <N.
		\]
		Note that $q>p$. 
		Set 
		\[
		Y:= L^\infty((0,1); M^{q,\lambda})
		\]
		and
		\[
		\|u|Y\| := \sup_{t\in(0,1)} t^\beta |u|_q, \quad \beta:= \frac{\alpha}{p-1}\left(1-\frac{r}{q}\right) <\frac{\alpha}{p}.
		\]
		For $u\in Y$, define
		\[
		\Phi[u](t):= P_\alpha(t)\mu +\alpha\int_0^t (t-s)^{\alpha-1} S_\alpha(t-s)|u(s)|^p \,ds.
		\]
		Denote $B_M := \{u\in Y;\|u|Y\|\le M\}$ for $M>0$, which will be fixed later, 
          and set 
		\[
		d(u,v) := \|u-v|Y\| \qquad u, v \in B_M,
		\]
		then $(B_M,d)$ becomes a complete metric space.
		 We are going to show below that $\Phi$ maps $B_M$ into itself for all $t \in (0,1)$.
		Since 
		\[
		-\frac{1}{p-1}\left(1-\frac{r}{q}\right)>-1, \quad 1-\frac{r}{q}>0,
		\]
		by \eqref{eq:1.4}, we have
		\[
		\int_0^\infty (1+\theta^{-\frac{1}{p-1}(1-\frac{r}{q})})h_{\alpha}(\theta)\, d\theta= 1+\frac{\Gamma\left(1-\frac{1}{p-1}(1-\frac{r}{q})\right)}{\Gamma\left(1-\frac{1}{p-1}(1-\frac{r}{q})\right)}<\infty
		\]
		and
		\[
		\int_0^\infty (\theta +\theta^{1-\frac{r}{q}})h_{\alpha}(\theta)\, d\theta = \frac{\Gamma(2)}{\Gamma(1+\alpha)}+\frac{\Gamma\left(2-\frac{r}{q}\right)}{\Gamma\left(1+\alpha-\frac{r}{q}\right)}<\infty.
		\]
	     Note that the constants above are uniformly bounded near $\alpha=1$, and	
           that $|f^p|_\frac{q}{p} = |f|_q^p$ for all $f\in M^{q,\lambda}({\bf R}^N)$. 
       Let $u\in B_M$ and $t\in (0,1]$. 
		It follows from Proposition \ref{MpMq} and \eqref{super:1} that
		\begin{equation*}
		\begin{split}
		t^\beta |P_\alpha (t) \mu |_q
		&\le t^\beta \int_0^\infty h_\alpha(\theta) |e^{t^\alpha \theta \Delta}\mu |_q\, d\theta ds\\
		&\le C |\mu|_r\int_0^\infty h_\alpha(\theta )(1+\theta^{-\frac{1}{p-1}(1-\frac{r}{q})})\, d\theta \\
		&\le C_1\gamma_3
		\end{split}
		\end{equation*}
		for $0<t\le1$. Moreover,
		\begin{equation*}

		\end{split}
		\end{equation*}
		for $0<t\le1$. 
		Note that $C_1$ and $C_2$ are independent of $\alpha$.
		Setting
		\begin{equation}
		\gamma_3 := c_* B\left(\alpha\left(1-\frac{r}{q}\right), 1-\frac{p\alpha}{p-1}\left(1-\frac{r}{q}\right) \right)^{-\frac{1}{p-1}}
		\end{equation}
		and
		\[
		M:= 2C_1c_*B\left(\alpha\left(1-\frac{r}{q}\right), 1-\frac{p\alpha}{p-1}\left(1-\frac{r}{q}\right) \right)^{-\frac{1}{p-1}}
		\]
		and taking sufficiently small $c_*>0$ if necessary, we can derive the following estimate from the above inequalities
		\begin{equation*}
		\begin{split}
		%\label{super:2}
		\|\Phi[u]|Y\|
		&=\sup_{t\in(0,1)}t^\beta |\Phi[u](t)|_q \\
		&\le (C_1c_*+2^pC_1^pC_2c_*^p)B\left(\alpha\left(1-\frac{r}{q}\right), 1-\frac{p\alpha}{p-1}\left(1-\frac{r}{q}\right) \right)^{-\frac{1}{p-1}}\\
		& \le 2C_1c_*B\left(\alpha\left(1-\frac{r}{q}\right), 1-\frac{p\alpha}{p-1}\left(1-\frac{r}{q}\right) \right)^{-\frac{1}{p-1}}=M.
		\end{split}
		\end{equation*}
		This implies that $\Phi: B_M \to B_M$.
		
		Next, we show that $\Phi: B_M \to B_M$ is a contraction mapping. Take any $u,v\in B_M$, then by manipulations similar to those above, 
		 we have
		\begin{equation}
		\label{super:3}
		\begin{split}
		& t^\beta |\Phi[u](t)-\Phi[v](t)|_q \\
		&\le \alpha t^\beta \int_0^t (t-s)^{\alpha-1} \int_0^\infty \theta h_\alpha(\theta) |e^{(t-s)^\alpha \theta \Delta}(|u(s)|^p-|v(s)|^p)|_q  \, d\theta ds\\
		&\le \alpha t^\beta \int_0^t (t-s)^{\alpha-1} \int_0^\infty \theta h_\alpha(\theta)

		&\le \alpha t^\beta\int_0^t (t-s)^{(1-\frac{r}{q})\alpha-1} |(|u(s)|^p-|v(s)|^p)|_\frac{q}{p}  \,  ds
		\int_0^\infty  h_\alpha(\theta) 
		(\theta+\theta^{1-\frac{r}{q}})\,d\theta \\
		&\le  C t^\beta \int_0^t (t-s)^{(1-\frac{r}{q})\alpha-1}  ||u(s)|^p-|v(s)|^p|_\frac{q}{p} \, ds\\
		&\le  C t^\beta \int_0^t (t-s)^{(1-\frac{r}{q})\alpha-1}  (|u(s)|_q^{p-1} + |v(s)|_q^{p-1})|u(s)-v(s)|_q  \, ds\\
		&\le  C  M^{p-1}t^\beta  \int_0^t (t-s)^{(1-\frac{r}{q})\alpha-1} s^{-p\beta}\, ds \, d(u,v)\\
		&\le C_3 M^{p-1} B\left(\alpha\left(1-\frac{r}{q}\right), 1-\frac{p\alpha}{p-1}\left(1-\frac{r}{q}\right) \right)d(u,v)
		\end{split}
		\end{equation}
		for $0<t\le1$. 
		Note that $C_3$ is independent of $\alpha$.
		Taking sufficiently small $c_*>0$ if necessary, we get by \eqref{super:3}
		\[
		d(\Phi[u], \Phi[v]) \le 2^{p-1}C_1^{p-1}C_3c_*^{p-1} d(u,v) \le \frac{1}{2} d(u,v)
		\] 
		for $u,v\in B_M$. 
		Note that $c_*$ is independent of $\alpha$.
		This implies that $\Phi: B_M \to B_M$ is a contraction mapping. 
		Therefore, by the contraction mapping theorem, we know $\Phi$ has a unique fixed point $u\in B_M$. 
		Obviously, if $\mu$ is a nonnegative measurable function in ${\bf R}^N$, we see that $u(x,t)\ge0$ for almost all $t\in(0,1]$ and $x\in{\bf R}^N$.
		Thus $u$ is a nonnegative solution of \eqref{TFF} in $(0,1]\times{\bf R}^N$ 
         and Theorem~\ref{Thm:1.3} is proved.

	%\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem \ref{Thm:1.2} in the case of $p= p_F$.]
	%It suffices to consider the case of $T=1$. Indeed, for any solution $u$ of \eqref{TFF} in $[0,T)\times{\bf R}^N$, where $0<T<\infty$, we see that $u_\lambda (x,t) := \lambda^{2\alpha/(p-1)}u(\lambda^2 t , \lambda^\alpha x)$ with $\lambda:= \sqrt{T}$ is a solution of \eqref{TFF} in $[0,1)\times{\bf R}^N$.

	\section{Collapse of the solvability}\label{section. Collapse of the solvability}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\subsection{Preliminaries.}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	
	First, we define the life span of solutions of \eqref{TFF}. For this purpose, we recall the following result given in \cite{GMS22}.
	\begin{proposition}
		\label{Prop:min}
		If problem \eqref{TFF} possesses a supersolution in $[0,T]\times{\bf R}^N$, then problem \eqref{TFF} possesses a solution $\overline{u}$ in $[0,T]\times{\bf R}^N$ in the sense of Definition {\rm \ref{Def:1.1}}.
		Furthermore, $\overline{u}$ satisfies
		\begin{equation}
		\label{min}
		0\le \overline{u}(x,t) \le v(x,t) \quad \mbox{for a.a.} \quad t \in (0,T], \, x\in{\bf R}^N
		\end{equation}
		for all solutions $v$ of  \eqref{TFF} in $[0,T]\times{\bf R}^N$.
	\end{proposition}

	We call the solution $\overline{u}$ satisfying \eqref{min} the minimal solution of \eqref{TFF}.
	Since the minimal solution is unique, we can define the life span of solutions of problem \eqref{TFF} as
	\[
	T_\alpha\left[ \mu \right]:=\sup\{T'>0 ; \mbox{the minimal solution of \eqref{TFF} exists in} \,\, [0,T']\times{\bf R}^N\}.
	\]
	By virtue of Proposition \ref{Prop:min}, we can regard the solutions that were obtained in Theorems~\ref{Thm:1.2} and \ref{Thm:1.3} as the minimal solutions. 
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\subsection{Collapse of the global-in-time solvability.}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	In this subsection, we prove Theorem~\ref{Thm:4.1} which indicates the occurrence mechanism of the collapse of the global-in-time solvability. 
       As introduced in Section~1, let
	\[
	\mathcal{G}_{\alpha}:=\left\{ ~\! \nu \in \mathcal{M} ~\! ; ~\! 
         \text{\eqref{TFF} with } u(0) = \nu \geq 0 \ \text{ possesses a global-in-time solution.}
	\right\}.
	\]
	In other words, 
	\[
	\mathcal{G}_{\alpha}= \left\{ ~\! \nu\in \mathcal{M} ~\!; ~\!
	\nu \geq 0, \  T_{\alpha}[\nu]=\infty ~\! \right\}
	\]
                        
	\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{Thm:4.1}] 
		The inclusion
		\[
		\mathcal{B}^+\left( C_1(1-\alpha)^{\frac{N}{2}} \right) \subset \mathcal{G}_{\alpha}
		\]
		is easily deduced from Theorem~\ref{Thm:1.2}. On the other hand, suppose that $\mu \in \mathcal{G}_\alpha$. Then, problem \eqref{TFF} possesses a global-in-time solution and
		\eqref{Thm:1.1.2} holds for all $T>1$.
		Letting $\sigma=T^{\alpha/4} (<T^{\alpha/2})$, we have
		\begin{equation*}
		\sup_{z\in{\bf R}^N} \mu(B(z;T^\frac{\alpha}{4})) \le \gamma'_1 \left(\int_{(16\sqrt{T})^{-1}}^{1/4} t^{-\alpha} \, dt \right)^{-\frac{N}{2}}.
		\end{equation*}
		%
		Since $\limsup_{\alpha\to1-0} \gamma'_1(\alpha) \in (0,\infty)$,
		we have
		\[
		\overline{\gamma} := \sup_{\alpha\in[1/2,1)} \gamma'_1(\alpha) \in (0,\infty).
		\]
		Now taking $T\to\infty$, we obtain
		\begin{equation*}
		\mu({\bf R}^N) \le \gamma'_1\left(\int_{0}^{1/4} t^{-\alpha} \, dt \right)^{-\frac{N}{2}}= 4^{\alpha-1} \gamma'_1 (1-\alpha)^\frac{N}{2}\le \overline{\gamma}(1-\alpha)^\frac{N}{2}.
		\end{equation*}
		This implies that $\mu\in\mathcal{B}^+(C_2 (1-\alpha)^\frac{N}{2})
		$ with $C_2= \max\{\overline{\gamma},C_1\}$.
		Then \eqref{Thm:4.1.1} follows.
	\end{proof}
	
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\subsection{Collapse of the local-in-time solvability}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	In this subsection, we prove Theorem~\ref{Thm:4.2}. As introduced in Section~1, for $0<\epsilon<N/2$, let
	\[
	f_\epsilon(x) := |x|^{-N}\left|\log|x|\right|^{-\frac{N}{2}-1+\epsilon}\chi_{B(0;1/e)}.
	\]
	Note that $f_{\epsilon}\in L^1({\bf R}^N)$. It is observed that \eqref{Fjt} with $\mu = f_{\epsilon}$ possesses no local-in-time solutions. In contrast, the local-in-time solvability of the time-fractional equation \eqref{TFF} for any $L^1({\bf R}^N)$ initial data is guaranteed. The occurrence mechanism of this collapse of the local-in-time solvability can be explained by establishing the precise $\alpha$-dependence of the life span for $f_{\epsilon}$.
	
	\begin{proof}[Proof of Theorem~\ref{Thm:4.2}]		
		It follows that
		\begin{equation*}
		\sup_{z\in{\bf R}^N} \int_{B(z;\sigma)} f_{\epsilon}(x)\,dx = \int_{B(0;\sigma)} f_{\epsilon}(x)\,dx = C \left( \log \frac{1}{\sigma} \right)^{-\frac{N}{2}+\epsilon}
		\end{equation*}
		for all $\sigma\le 1/e$. 
		Firstly, we derive an upper estimate. Define 
		\[
		\overline{T_\alpha} [\kappa f_\epsilon] := \min\left\{ T_{\alpha}[\kappa f_{\epsilon}], e^{-\frac{2}{\alpha}}\right\} \le  T_{\alpha}[\kappa f_{\epsilon}].
		\]
		We can assume that problem \eqref{TFF} with $\mu=\kappa f_\epsilon$ possesses a solution in $[0,\overline{T_\alpha}[\kappa f_\epsilon]]\times{\bf R}^N$.
		Since $(1-\alpha)^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}<1$, we can take 
		\[
		\sigma = \overline{T_\alpha} [\kappa f_\epsilon]^\frac{\alpha}{2}  (1-\alpha)^{\frac{\alpha}{2(1-\alpha)}} \le \overline{T_{\alpha}}[\kappa f_{\epsilon}]^\frac{\alpha}{2} \le e^{-1}
		\]
		in Theorem~\ref{Thm:1.1}. 
		Therefore, the necessary condition \eqref{Thm:1.1.2} provides
		\begin{equation*}
		\begin{split}
		\kappa \left( \log \frac{1}{\sigma} \right)^{-\frac{N}{2}+\epsilon}
		&\le C (1-\alpha)^{\frac{N}{2}} \left( \left( \frac{1}{4} \right)^{1-\alpha}-\left( \frac{1}{16} \right)^{1-\alpha}(1-\alpha) \right)^{-\frac{N}{2}}\\
		&\le C (1-\alpha)^{\frac{N}{2}} 
		\end{split}
		\end{equation*}
		near $\alpha =1$. Note that $C$ is independent of $\alpha$.
		This implies that
		\[
		\sigma \le \exp \left( -C \kappa^{\frac{2}{N-2\epsilon}} (1-\alpha)^{-\frac{N}{N-2\epsilon}} \right),
		\]
		that is 
		\begin{equation*}
		\begin{split}
		\overline{T_{\alpha}}[\kappa f_{\epsilon}]
		&\le (1-\alpha)^{-\frac{1}{1-\alpha}} \exp \left( -\frac{2}{\alpha}C \kappa^{\frac{2}{N-2\epsilon}} (1-\alpha)^{-\frac{N}{N-2\epsilon}} \right)\\
		&\le (1-\alpha)^{-\frac{1}{1-\alpha}} \exp \left( -C \kappa^{\frac{2}{N-2\epsilon}} (1-\alpha)^{-\frac{N}{N-2\epsilon}} \right)
		\end{split}
		\end{equation*}
		near $\alpha=1$. Here, we claim that
		\[
		(1-\alpha)^{-\frac{1}{1-\alpha}} \exp\left( -C \kappa^{\frac{2}{N-2\epsilon}} (1-\alpha)^{-\frac{N}{N-2\epsilon}} \right) \le \exp \left( -C' \kappa^{\frac{2}{N-2\epsilon}} (1-\alpha)^{-\frac{N}{N-2\epsilon}} \right)
		\]
		for appropriate $C'>0$. Indeed, it suffices to show that for any $K>0$ and $\beta>1$,
		\begin{equation}\label{eq. inequality}
		(1-\alpha)^{-\frac{1}{1-\alpha}} \exp \left( -K (1-\alpha)^{-\beta} \right)<1
		\end{equation}
		holds near $\alpha=1$, which is assured by Lemma~\ref{lem. inequality} below. 
		Therefore, it follows that
		\[
		\overline{T_\alpha} [\kappa f_\epsilon] = \min\left\{  T_{\alpha}[\kappa f_{\epsilon}],\ e^{-\frac{2}{\alpha}} \right\} \le \exp \left( -C \kappa^{\frac{2}{N-2\epsilon}} (1-\alpha)^{-\frac{N}{N-2\epsilon}} \right)
		\]
		near $\alpha =1$.
		Since the right-hand side of the above inequality tends to $0$ as $\alpha \to 1-0$,
		there exists a $\alpha(\kappa,\epsilon)\in (0,1)$ such that all the above calculations are justified and
		\[
		e^{-\frac{2}{\alpha}} \ge \exp \left( -C \kappa^{\frac{2}{N-2\epsilon}} (1-\alpha)^{-\frac{N}{N-2\epsilon}} \right)
		\]
		holds for $\alpha(\kappa,\epsilon ) <\alpha <1$.
		This implies that
		\[
		T_{\alpha}[\kappa f_{\epsilon}] \le \exp \left( -C \kappa^{\frac{2}{N-2\epsilon}} (1-\alpha)^{-\frac{N}{N-2\epsilon}} \right)
		\]
		for $\alpha(\kappa,\epsilon ) <\alpha <1$,
		and the upper estimate of $T_{\alpha}[\kappa f_{\epsilon}] $ has been obtained.
		
		Let us deduce the lower estimate. 
		Define
		\[
		\overline{T} := \exp \left( -C \kappa^\frac{2}{N-2\epsilon}(1-\alpha)^{-\frac{N}{N-2\epsilon}} \right)
		\]
		for appropriate $C>0$.
		It suffices to show that problem \eqref{TFF} possesses a solution in $[0,\overline{T}]\times{\bf R}^N$.
		Since $\lim_{\alpha\to1-0} \overline{T}(\alpha)=0$, we  may assume that $\overline{T}<e^{-1}$.
		We have
		\begin{equation*}
		\begin{split}
		\sup_{z\in{\bf R}^N} \int_{B(z;\overline{T}^{\alpha/2})}\kappa f_\epsilon(x)\,dx
		&= \int_{B(0;\overline{T}^{\alpha/2})}\kappa f_\epsilon(x)\,dx\\
		& = \kappa \left( \log \frac{1}{\overline{T}^{{\alpha/2}}} \right)^{-\frac{N}{2}+\epsilon}\\
		& = C (1-\alpha)^\frac{N}{2} \to 0\quad \mbox{as} \quad \alpha\to1-0.
		\end{split}
		\end{equation*}
		This implies that \eqref{Thm:1.2.1} holds near $\alpha=1$ and guarantees the solvability on $[0,\overline{T}]$.
		In particular, $\overline{T} \le T_{\alpha}[\kappa f_{\epsilon}]$ is verified
		and  the lower estimate of $T_{\alpha}[\kappa f_{\epsilon}] $ has been obtained.

	\begin{Lemma}\label{lem. inequality}
		Inequality \eqref{eq. inequality} holds true. More precisely, for all $K>0$ and $\beta>1$,
		\[
		\tau^{-\frac{1}{\tau}} \exp\left( -K \tau^{-\beta} \right)<1
		\]
		for sufficiently small $\tau>0$. 
	\end{Lemma}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	\begin{proof}
		The conclusion is equivalent to the following inequality
		\[
		\tau^{-1}\exp\left(- K \tau^{1-\beta} \right) < 1
		\]
		near $\tau=0$ and it is true since $ \tau^{-1}\exp\left(- K \tau^{1-\beta}\right) \to 0$ as $\tau\to 0$.
	\end{proof}
	
	\begin{Remark}
		{\rm 
		In Theorem~\ref{Thm:4.2}, the lower estimate is true for all $0<\alpha<1$, while the upper estimate does not hold for any $0<\alpha<1$ in general. Indeed, for each $\alpha$, if $\kappa$ is sufficiently small, then $T_{\alpha}[\kappa f_{\epsilon}]=\infty$ (See Theorem~\ref{Thm:4.1}). However, no matter how small $\kappa$ is, $T_{\alpha}[\kappa f_{\epsilon}]$ becomes finite if $\alpha$ approaches $1$ (collapse of the \textit{global-in-time} solvability), and $\alpha \to 1-0$ yields $T_{\alpha}[\kappa f_{\epsilon}]\to 0$ (collapse of the \textit{local-in-time} solvability).

	\subsection{Life span for the Dirac measure}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	
	Let us consider  problem \eqref{TFF} with
	\begin{equation*}
	\mu=\kappa \delta_N,
	\end{equation*}
	where $\kappa>0$ and $\delta_N$ is the $N$-dimensional Dirac measure concentrated at the origin.
	As a corollary of Theorems~\ref{Thm:1.1} and \ref{Thm:1.2}, we have the following statement.
	\begin{corollary}
		\label{Cor:1.1}
		Assume $\mu = \kappa \delta_N$, where $\kappa>0$.
		Then one has the following:
		\begin{enumerate}[{\rm (i)}]
			\item If $p<p_F$, then \eqref{TFF} possesses a local-in-time solution for all $\kappa>0$. Furthermore, we have
			\begin{equation*}
			T_{\alpha}[\kappa \delta_N] \simeq \kappa^{-\frac{2(p-1)}{\alpha (2-N(p-1))}}.
			\end{equation*}
			
			\item If $p=p_F$, there exists $\kappa(\alpha)>0$ such that:
			\begin{itemize}
				\item If $\kappa<\kappa(\alpha)$, then \eqref{TFF} possesses a global-in-time solution;
				\item If $\kappa(\alpha)<\kappa$, then \eqref{TFF} possesses no local-in-time solutions.
			\end{itemize}
			
			\item If $p>p_F$, then \eqref{TFF} possesses no local-in-time solutions for all $\kappa>0$.
		\end{enumerate}
	\end{corollary}
	\begin{proof}
		We only observe that
		\[
		T_{\alpha}[\kappa \delta_N] = +\infty \text{ or }0
		\]
		when $p=p_F$. Indeed, if there exists a local-in-time solution $u(t,x)$ in $[0,T]\times\textbf{R}^N$, then $u_{\lambda}(t,x):=\lambda^{2\alpha/(p-1)} u(\lambda^2t, \lambda^{\alpha}x)$ is a solution in $[0,\lambda^{-2}T]\times \textbf{R}^N$. Note that the initial data of $u$ and $u_{\lambda}$ are same. That is,
		\[
		\lambda^{N\alpha}\delta_N(\lambda^{\alpha}x)=\delta_N(x)
		\]
		for all $\lambda>0$. Therefore, we can solve \eqref{TFF} with $u(0)=\delta_N$ for arbitrarily large $T>0$.
	\end{proof}
	
	
	From Corollary \ref{Cor:1.1}, we see that $p=p_F$ is the threshold of the existence of nonnegative local-in-time solutions when the initial value is the Dirac measure. By using the corresponding condition in \cite{HisaIshige18} for problem \eqref{Fjt}, we observe that problem \eqref{Fjt} has no solutions for any $\kappa>0$ if $p=p_F$, while problem \eqref{TFF} can be solvable for small $\kappa>0$. By a proof similar to that of Theorem~\ref{Thm:4.1}, the following estimate is guaranteed:
	\begin{equation*}
	\kappa(\alpha)\simeq (1-\alpha)^{N/2}.
	\end{equation*}
	
	Let us take the sequence of functions which converges to $\delta_N$:
	\begin{equation*}
	\psi_j(x):=j \chi_{B(0;r_j)},\ \ r_j:=\left( j \omega_N \right)^{-\frac{1}{N}}
	\end{equation*}
	where $j\in{\bf N}$ and $\omega_N$ is the volume of the $N$-dimensional unit ball. We can obtain the following life span estimate for $\mu=\kappa \psi_j$ and its behavior when $j\to \infty$.

%%%%%%%%%%  Theorem 5.1      %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%	
	\begin{theorem}
		Let $p=p_F$, then there exists $\kappa_1(\alpha)>0$ such that 
          for any $\kappa \in (\kappa_1(\alpha), \infty)$ and a suitable 
           $C_{\kappa}>0$ depending on $\kappa>0$, we have  
		\begin{equation}\label{eq. Talpha for delta1}
		T_{\alpha}[\kappa\psi_j]\le C_{\kappa} j^{-\frac{2}{\alpha N}}.
		\end{equation}
          We also have $\kappa_1(\alpha)\simeq (1-\alpha)^{N/2}$. 
             Moreover, if $\kappa>0$ is sufficiently large, then we can take
		\begin{equation}\label{est:C:kappa}
		C_{\kappa}= C \kappa^{-\frac{2}{\alpha N}}
		\end{equation}
		for an appropriate $C>0$.
	\end{theorem}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	
	\begin{proof}
		It follows that
		\[
		\int_{B(0;\sigma)}  \psi_j(x)dx= \kappa j \omega_N \min\left\{ \sigma^{N}, r_j^N \right\}.
		\]
		Therefore, necessary condition \eqref{Thm:1.1.2} requires that
		\[
		\kappa j\omega_N \min\left\{ \sigma^{N}, r_j^N \right\}\le \gamma_1'(\alpha) \left( \int^{1/4}_{\sigma^{2/\alpha}/(16T_{\alpha}[\kappa\psi_j])} t^{-\alpha}\,dt \right)^{-\frac{N}{2}}
		\]
		for all $\sigma\le T_{\alpha}[\kappa \psi_j]^{\alpha/2}$. We show that
		\[
		\kappa_1(\alpha)= 4^{\frac{N}{2}(1-\alpha)} \gamma_1'(\alpha)(1-\alpha)^{\frac{N}{2}}
		\]
		satisfies the desired argument. Indeed, suppose that $\kappa>\kappa_1(\alpha)$. If $r_j\ge T_{\alpha}[\kappa \psi_j]^{\alpha/2}$, we have nothing to prove. Hence, without the loss of generality, we assume that $r_j\le T_{\alpha}[\kappa \psi_j]^{\alpha/2}$. Then, we obtain
		\[
		\kappa \le \gamma_1'(\alpha)(1-\alpha)^{\frac{N}{2}} \left[ 4^{\alpha-1} - \left( \frac{r_j^{2/\alpha}}{16T_{\alpha}[\kappa\psi_j]} \right)^{1-\alpha} \right]^{-\frac{N}{2}}.
		\]
		Since $\kappa>\kappa_1(\alpha)$, this inequality gives
		\[
		T_{\alpha}[\kappa\psi_j]\le \frac{16^{-1}r_j^{2/\alpha}}{\left[4^{\alpha-1} - \left(\gamma_1'(\alpha)(1-\alpha)^{\frac{N}{2}}\kappa^{-1}\right)^{\frac{2}{N}}\right]^{\frac{1}{1-\alpha}}}
		\]
		and \eqref{eq. Talpha for delta1} is verified. Next, we see the $\kappa$-dependence of $C_{\kappa}$. We use \eqref{Thm:1.1.1} to get
		\[
		\kappa j \omega_N \min\left\{ \sigma^N, r_j^N \right\}\le \gamma_1(\alpha)
		\]
		for $\sigma\le T_{\alpha}[\kappa\psi_j]^{\alpha/2}$. 
          Note that the condition $\gamma_1(\alpha)<\kappa$ provides
		\[
		j\omega_N \min\left\{ \sigma^N, r_j^N \right\}< 1
		\]
		and therefore it must be satisfied that $\sigma<r_j$. Substituting $\sigma=T_{\alpha}[\kappa\psi_j]^{\alpha/2}$, we obtain
		\[
		T_{\alpha}[\kappa\psi_j] \le C \left( \kappa j \right)^{-\frac{2}{\alpha N}}
		\]
		for $\kappa>\gamma_1(\alpha)$, whence follows \eqref{est:C:kappa}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%5  Proof of Theorem 5.2     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%	
	\begin{proof}
		\rm{(i)} Let $p>p_F$. By Theorem~\ref{Thm:1.3}, the global-in-time solvability is guaranteed if
		\begin{equation*}
		\begin{aligned}
		\kappa j \omega_N^{\frac{1}{r}} \sigma^{\frac{N}{r}} &\le C \sigma^{\frac{N}{r}-\frac{2}{p-1}},\ \ &\mbox{for all}\ \ \sigma<r_j,\\
		\kappa j \omega_N^{\frac{1}{r}} r_j^{\frac{N}{r}} &\le C \sigma^{\frac{N}{r}-\frac{2}{p-1}},\ \ &\mbox{for all}\ \ \sigma\ge r_j,
		\end{aligned}
		\end{equation*}
		where $r>1$ satisfies
		\[
		\frac{2r}{p-1}<N.
		\]
		If $\sigma <r_j$, then it follows that
		\[
		\kappa j \omega_N^{\frac{1}{r}}\le C \inf_{0<\sigma<r_j} \sigma^{-\frac{2}{p-1}}= C r_j^{-\frac{2}{p-1}}.
		\]
		Since $\frac{N}{r}-\frac{2}{p-1}>0$, if $\sigma\ge r_j$, then
		\[
		\kappa j \omega_N^{\frac{1}{r}} r_j^{\frac{N}{r}} \le C \inf_{\sigma\ge r_j} \sigma^{\frac{N}{r}-\frac{2}{p-1}}= C r_j^{\frac{N}{r}-\frac{2}{p-1}}.
		\]
		In particular, the estimate
		\begin{equation*}
		\kappa j \le C r_j^{-\frac{2}{p-1}}
		\end{equation*}
		assures the global-in-time solvability. Therefore, for appropriate $C>0$, there exists a global-in-time solution if $\kappa = C j^{\frac{2}{p-1}-1}$. On the other hand, from Theorem~\ref{Thm:1.1}, if $T_{\alpha}[\kappa \psi_j]=\infty$, then
		\begin{equation*}
		\begin{aligned}
		\kappa j \omega_N \sigma^{N} &\le C \sigma^{N-\frac{2}{p-1}},\ \ &\mbox{for all}\ \ \sigma<r_j,\\
		\kappa j \omega_N r_j^{N} &\le C \sigma^{N-\frac{2}{p-1}},\ \ &\mbox{for all}\ \ \sigma\ge r_j.
		\end{aligned}
		\end{equation*}
		Therefore, the estimate \eqref{eq. kappa2n} is guaranteed.
		
		\rm{(ii)} By necessary condition \eqref{Thm:1.1.1}, for all $\sigma \le T_{\alpha}[\kappa \psi_j]^{\alpha/2}$,
		\[
		\kappa j \omega_N \min\left\{ \sigma^N, r_j^N \right\} \le \gamma_1(\alpha) \sigma^{N-\frac{2}{p-1}}.
		\]
		Substituting $\sigma= \min\left\{ T_{\alpha}[\kappa \psi_j]^{\alpha/2}, r_j \right\}$, 
        we get \eqref{eq. Talpha for delta2}. Since $p>p_F$, for sufficiently large $j\in{\bf N}$, it follows that $r_j> C\left( \kappa j \right)^{-(p-1)/2}$. That is, $T_{\alpha}[\kappa \psi_j]^{\alpha/2}\le C \left( \kappa j \right)^{-(p-1)/2}$ holds for large $j\in{\bf N}$.
		
		On the other hand, let $j\in{\bf N}$ be sufficiently large so that $T_{\alpha}[\kappa \psi_j]^{\alpha/2}<r_j$, and let $\overline{T}<r_j$. By Theorem~\ref{Thm:1.3}, the condition
		\[
		\kappa j \omega_N^{\frac{1}{r}} \sigma^{\frac{N}{r}} \le C \sigma^{\frac{N}{r}-\frac{2}{p-1}}
		\]
		for all $\sigma<\overline{T}^{\alpha/2}$ guarantees that $\overline{T} \le T_{\alpha}[\kappa \psi_j]$. We easily see that we can take $\overline{T}= C \left( \kappa j \right)^{-(p-1)/2}$.

	\subsection{Life span for decaying initial data.}
	%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
	For problem \eqref{Fjt}, Lee--Ni \cite{LeeNi92} and the first author and Ishige \cite{HisaIshige18} 
      obtained the sharp estimates of $T[\kappa\phi]$ as $\kappa\to+0$ for the following choice
	\begin{equation*}
	\phi(x) := (1+|x|)^{-A} \qquad A>0.
	\end{equation*}
	  We can obtain analogous estimates of the life span of solutions of problem \eqref{TFF} by applying our main theorems when $ p \neq p_F$. However, for the critical case $p=p_F$, the time-fractional problem \eqref{TFF} has a global-in-time solvability which is the major difference from \eqref{Fjt}. Therefore, we present a generalized statement that contains the analogous results for \eqref{Fjt} when $\alpha \to 1-0$.

	\end{theorem}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

	
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%  Proof of Theorem 5.3     %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%	
	\begin{proof}
		We have
		\begin{equation*}
		\begin{aligned}
		\int_{B(0;T^{\alpha/2})} (1+|x|)^{-A}\,dx &\le C \int_{0}^{T^{\alpha/2}} (1+r)^{-A+N-1}\,dr\\
		&\le \left\{

		&C \log\left(1+T^{\alpha/2}\right)\ &&\mbox{if}\ A=N.
		\end{aligned}
		\right.
		\end{aligned}
		\end{equation*}
		Therefore, for $A>N$, there exists a solution on $[0,T]$ if
		\begin{equation*}
		1-\frac{C\gamma_2(\alpha)}{\kappa}\le \left(1+T^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}\right)^{N-A}.
		\end{equation*}
		This inequality holds for all $T>0$ provided that $\kappa \le C\gamma_2(\alpha)=C(1-\alpha)^{N/2}$. Hence,
		\begin{equation*}\label{eq. estimate of kappa1}
		T_{\alpha}[\kappa \phi]=\infty\ \ \mbox{if}\ \ \kappa\le C (1-\alpha)^{\frac{N}{2}}
		\end{equation*}
		for an appropriate $C>0$. On the other hand, if $\kappa>C\gamma_2(\alpha)$,
		\begin{equation*}
		\left( 1- \frac{C\gamma_2(\alpha)}{\kappa} \right)^{-\frac{1}{A-N}}\le 1+T_{\alpha}[\kappa\phi]^{\frac{\alpha}{2}}
		\end{equation*}
		holds. In particular, $1\le T_{\alpha}[\kappa\phi]$ for sufficiently small $\kappa>0$. 
        To derive (\ref{eq. estimate of Tlambda1}), we first note that Theorem~\ref{Thm:1.1} yields
		\begin{equation*}
		C\kappa\le \kappa \int_{B(0;\sigma)}(1+|x|)^{-A}\,dx \le \gamma_1(\alpha) \left( \int_{\sigma^{2/\alpha}/(16T_{\alpha} [\lambda\phi])}^{1/4} t^{-\alpha}\,dt\right)^{-N/2}
		\end{equation*}
		for $\sigma\ge 1$ and $A>N$. For sufficiently small $\kappa>0$, take $1\le \sigma^{2/\alpha}=T_{\alpha}[\kappa\phi]^{1/2}<T_{\alpha}[\kappa \phi]$. Then,
		\begin{equation*}
		C\kappa \le \gamma_1(\alpha) \left( \int_{1/16T_{\alpha}[\kappa \phi]^{1/2}}^{1/4} t^{-\alpha}\,dt \right)^{-\frac{N}{2}}
		\end{equation*}
		holds. Therefore, we obtain
		\begin{equation*}
		T_{\alpha}[\kappa \phi]^{(\alpha-1)/2} \log T_{\alpha}[\kappa \phi]\le \int_{1/16T_{\alpha}[\kappa \phi]^{1/2}}^{1/4}t^{-\alpha}\,dt \le C\kappa^{-(p-1)}.
		\end{equation*}
		
		We can verify assertion (ii) in a similar way. Indeed, it follows that
		\[
		T_{\alpha}[\kappa\phi]^{\frac{\alpha-1}{2}} \log T_{\alpha}[\kappa \phi]\le C \kappa^{-\frac{2}{N}} \left( \log\left( e+ T_{\alpha}[\kappa \phi]^{\frac{\alpha}{4}} \right) \right)^{-\frac{2}{N}},

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%   Proof of Theorem 5.4    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%	
	\begin{proof} 
	We first give the estimate from below.
		%Firstly, we obtain a lower estimate.
  Let $p\ge p_F$ and $A<2/(p-1)$, which implies $A<N$. 
    Let $r>1$ and $ 2~\! r/(p-1)<N$ as assumed in Theorem~\ref{Thm:1.3}. 
      Then, in particular, it follows that $Ar<N$.
        Therefore, for all $x\in {\bf R}^N$ and $\sigma>0$,
		\begin{equation*}
		\left( \int_{B(0;\sigma)} \left( \kappa \phi(x) \right)^r \,dx \right)^{\frac{1}{r}}\le C \kappa \sigma^{\frac{N}{r}-A}
		\end{equation*}
		holds. Set
		\begin{equation*}
		\tilde{T}_{\kappa} := \delta \kappa^{-\left( \frac{\alpha}{p-1}-\frac{A\alpha}{2} \right)^{-1}}
		\end{equation*}
		for $0<\delta<1$. We have
		\begin{equation*}
		\kappa \sigma^{-A}= \sigma^{-\frac{2}{p-1}} \cdot \kappa \sigma^{\frac{2}{p-1}-A} \le \sigma^{-\frac{2}{p-1}}\cdot \kappa \tilde{T}_{\kappa}^{\frac{\alpha}{p-1}-\frac{A\alpha}{2}}= \delta^{\frac{\alpha}{p-1}-\frac{A\alpha}{2}} \sigma^{-\frac{2}{p-1}} 
		\end{equation*}
		for $0<\sigma <\tilde{T}_{\kappa}^{\alpha/2}$. We deduce the desired result by taking $\delta>0$ sufficiently small so that \eqref{Thm:1.3.1} with $T=\tilde{T}_{\kappa}$ is satisfied.
		
		Suppose that $p<p_F$. We see that
		\begin{equation*}
		\int_{B(0;\sigma)} \kappa \phi(x)\,dx \le \left\{
		\begin{split}
		& C\kappa\ &&\mbox{if}\ A>N,\\
		& C\kappa \log\left( 1+ \sigma \right)\ &&\mbox{if}\ A=N,\\
		& C\kappa \sigma^{N-A}\ &&\mbox{if}\ A<N.
		\end{split}
		\right.
		\end{equation*}
		Set
		\begin{equation*}
		\hat{T}_{\kappa}:= \left\{
		\begin{split}
		&\delta \kappa^{-\left( \frac{\alpha}{p-1}-\frac{\alpha}{2}\min(A,N) \right)^{-1}}\ &&\mbox{if}\ A\neq N,\\
		&\delta \left( \frac{\kappa^{-1}}{\log\left( \kappa^{-1} \right)} \right)^{\left( \frac{\alpha}{p-1}-\frac{N\alpha}{2} \right)^{-1}}\ &&\mbox{if}\ A=N.
		\end{split}
		\right.
		\end{equation*}
		We are able to take sufficiently small $\delta>0$ such that \eqref{Thm:1.2.1} is satisfied with $T=\hat{T}_{\kappa}$. We now give the estimate from above. It follows that for $\sigma>1$,
		\begin{equation}\label{lower est of phi}
		\int_{B(0;\sigma)} \kappa \phi(x)\,dx \ge \left\{
		\begin{split}
		&C \kappa\ &&\mbox{if}\ A>N,\\
		&C \kappa \log\left( e+\sigma \right)\ &&\mbox{if}\ A=N,\\
		&C \kappa \sigma^{N-A}\ &&\mbox{if}\ A<N.
		\end{split}
		\right.
		\end{equation}
		Therefore, by using \eqref{Thm:1.1.1} and \eqref{lower est of phi} with $\sigma=T_{\alpha}[\kappa\phi]^{\alpha/2}/2\ge 1$ for sufficiently small $\kappa>0$, we obtain the desired result.

     the collapse of the global and local-in-time solvability of \eqref{TFF} with $p=p_F$ when $\alpha$ approaches to $1-0$. To carry out this program, we derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the solvability of \eqref{TFF} in a precise way, and apply these results to reveal the collapse mechanisms. Through this procedure, we conclude that the collapse of the global-in-time solvability results from the shrinkage of $\mathcal{G}_{\alpha}$, the set of initial data admitting global-in-time solutions, towards $\{0\}$ as $\alpha \to 1$. On the other hand, the collapse of the local-in-time solvability of \eqref{TFF} for the special family $\{f_{\epsilon}\}$ of initial data is caused by the decay of the life span $T_{\alpha}\left[ f_{\epsilon} \right]$ of the solution $u(t)$ of \eqref{TFF} with $u(0)= f_{\epsilon}$ towards zero as $\alpha \to 1$.
