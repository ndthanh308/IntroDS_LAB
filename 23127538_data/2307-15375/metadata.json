  "abstract": "Neutron stars with very strong magnetic fields are known as magnetars. There are multiple theories that predict magnetars may be able to emit high-energy (HE) neutrinos through hadronic processes by accelerating cosmic rays to high energies. A subclass of magnetars known as soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) can produce giant flares that can result in the production of HE neutrinos. Some magnetars also exhibit bursting activity during which they may emit HE neutrinos. Here we describe our time-integrated search for neutrino emission from magnetars listed in the McGill Online Magnetar Catalog and three newly discovered magnetars SGR 1830-0645, Swift J1555.5-5402, and NGC 253. SGR 1830-0645 and Swift J1555.2-5402 were discovered in 2020 and 2021 respectively by SWIFT after emitting short bursts. A very bright short gamma-ray burst that is believed to be a magnetar giant flare has been localized to NGC 253. We use 14 years of well-reconstructed muon-neutrino candidate events collected by the IceCube Neutrino Observatory to look for significant clustering in the direction of magnetars.",
