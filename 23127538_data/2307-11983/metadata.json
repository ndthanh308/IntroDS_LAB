  "abstract": "For a family of graphs $\\F$, a graph is called $\\F$-free if it does not contain any member of $\\F$ as a subgraph. The generalized Turán number $\\ex(n,K_r,\\F)$ is the maximum number of $K_r$ in an $n$-vertex $\\F$-free graph and $\\ex(n,K_2,\\F)=\\ex(n,\\F)$, i.e., the classical Turán number. Let $M_{s+1}$ be a matching on $s+1$ edges and $F$ be any graph. In this paper, we determine $\\ex(n,K_r, \\{M_{s+1},F\\})$ apart from a constant additive term and also give a condition when the error constant term can be determined. In particular, we give the exact value of $\\ex(n,\\{M_{s+1},F\\})$ for $F$ being any non-bipartite graph or some bipartite graphs. Furthermore, we determine $\\ex(n,K_r,\\{M_{s+1},F\\})$ when $F$ is color critical with $χ(F)\\ge \\max\\{r+1,4\\}$.\n  These extend the results in [2,11,18].",
