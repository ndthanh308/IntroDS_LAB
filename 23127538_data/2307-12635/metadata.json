  "abstract": "We show that a contact $(+1)$-surgery along a Legendrian sphere in a flexibly fillable contact manifold ($c_1=0$ if not subcritical) yields a contact manifold that is algebraically overtwisted if the Legendrian's homology class is not annihilated in the filling. Our construction can also be implemented in more general contact manifolds yielding algebraically overtwisted manifolds through $(+1)$-surgeries. This gives new proof of the vanishing of contact homology for overtwisted contact manifolds. Our result can be viewed as the symplectic field theory analog in any dimension of the vanishing of contact Ozsváth-Szabó invariant for $(+1)$-surgeries on two-component Legendrian links proved by Ding, Li, and Wu.",
