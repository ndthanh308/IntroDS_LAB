  "abstract": "Precision medicine, tailored to individual patients based on their genetics, environment, and lifestyle, shows promise in managing complex diseases like infections. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into precision medicine can revolutionize disease management. This paper introduces a novel approach using AI to advance precision medicine in infectious diseases and beyond. It integrates diverse fields, analyzing patients' profiles using genomics, proteomics, microbiomics, and clinical data. AI algorithms process vast data, providing insights for precise diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. AI-driven predictive modeling empowers healthcare providers to make personalized and effective interventions. Collaboration among experts from different domains refines AI models and ensures ethical and robust applications. Beyond infections, this AI-driven approach can benefit other complex diseases. Precision medicine powered by AI has the potential to transform healthcare into a proactive, patient-centric model. Research is needed to address privacy, regulations, and AI integration into clinical workflows. Collaboration among researchers, healthcare institutions, and policymakers is crucial in harnessing AI-driven strategies for advancing precision medicine and improving patient outcomes.",
