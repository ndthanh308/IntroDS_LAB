@article{doi:10.1098/rsta.2021.0162,
	abstract = { The first part of this paper is a brief survey of the approaches to economic inequality based on ideas from statistical physics and kinetic theory. These include the Boltzmann kinetic equation, the time-reversal symmetry, the ergodicity hypothesis, entropy maximization and the Fokker--Planck equation. The origins of the exponential Boltzmann--Gibbs distribution and the Pareto power law are discussed in relation to additive and multiplicative stochastic processes. The second part of the paper analyses income distribution data in the USA for the time period 1983--2018 using a two-class decomposition. We present overwhelming evidence that the lower class (more than 90\% of the population) is described by the exponential distribution, whereas the upper class (about 4\% of the population in 2018) by the power law. We show that the significant growth of inequality during this time period is due to the sharp increase in the upper-class income share, whereas relative inequality within the lower class remains constant. We speculate that the expansion of the upper-class population and income shares may be due to increasing digitization and non-locality of the economy in the last 40 years. This article is part of the theme issue `Kinetic exchange models of societies and economies'. },

@article{Cardoso:2020aa,
	abstract = {Simple agent based exchange models are a commonplace in the study of wealth distribution in an artificial economy. Generally, in a system that is composed of many agents characterized by their wealth and risk-aversion factor, two agents are selected sequentially and randomly to exchange wealth, allowing its redistribution. Here we analyze how the effect of social protection policies, which favor agents of lower wealth during the exchange, influences the stability and some relevant economic indicators of the system. On the other hand, we study how periods of interruption of these policies produce, in the short and long term, changes in the system. In all cases, a steady state is reached, but with varying relaxation times. We conclude that regulations may improve economic mobility and reduce inequality. Moreover, our results indicate that the removal of social protection entails a high cost associated with the hysteresis of the distribution of wealth. Economic inequalities increase during the period without social protection and decrease when they are restored. But recovery to the initial equilibrium may take longer than it took to disturb it. In some extreme cases, inequality is irreversible.},

@article{Francisco-Cardoso:2023aa,
	abstract = {If wealthier people have advantages in having higher returns than the poor, inequality will unequivocally increase. But is equal opportunity enough to prevent it? According to our results, no. We prove that fair markets lead to the inevitable concentration of wealth. It is an intrinsic feature of its non-trivial dynamics, even though no individual can have the advantages of repeated gains. We solve this apparent paradox by presenting a rigorous analytical proof. Using the Boltzmann-like master equation formalism, we demonstrate that a fair market that gives each agent the same expected return leads the system to maximum inequality, i.e. the thermal death of the economy. Therefore, even equality of opportunity --without an explicit bias in favor of wealthy people--generates inequality.},

@article{e25071105,
	abstract = {In view of some recent reports on global wealth inequality, where a small number (often a handful) of people own more wealth than 50% of the world&rsquo;s population, we explored if kinetic exchange models of markets could ever capture features where a significant fraction of wealth can concentrate in the hands of a few as the market size N approaches infinity. One existing example of such a kinetic exchange model is the Chakraborti or Yard-Sale model; in the absence of tax redistribution, etc., all wealth ultimately condenses into the hands of a single individual (for any value of N), and the market dynamics stop. With tax redistribution, etc., steady-state dynamics are shown to have remarkable applicability in many cases in our extremely unequal world. We show that another kinetic exchange model (called the Banerjee model) has intriguing intrinsic dynamics, where only ten rich traders or agents possess about 99.98% of the total wealth in the steady state (without any tax, etc., like external manipulation) for any large N value. We will discuss the statistical features of this model using Monte Carlo simulations. We will also demonstrate that if each trader has a non-zero probability f of engaging in random exchanges, then these condensations of wealth (e.g., 100% in the hand of one agent in the Chakraborti model, or about 99.98% in the hands of ten agents in the Banerjee model) disappear in the large N limit. Moreover, due to the built-in possibility of random exchange dynamics in the earlier proposed Goswami&ndash;Sen model, where the exchange probability decreases with the inverse power of the wealth difference between trading pairs, one does not see any wealth condensation phenomena. In this paper, we explore these aspects of statistics of these intriguing models.},
