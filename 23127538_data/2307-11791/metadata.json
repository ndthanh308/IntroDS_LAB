  "abstract": "The advent of arXiv has revolutionized scientific communication. However, its cultural significance goes far beyond simply accelerating scholarly communication. The arXiv gave a powerful impetus to the democratization of science, freeing young scientists and not only, especially from totalitarian countries, from authoritarian oppression. Many of arXiv's innovative features have been blurred by the introduction of a moderation system. Without a doubt, a moderation system is essential to maintain the quality of arXiv content. However, I believe that it can be improved in line with arXiv's original intentions, using the very successful experience of the MathOverflow moderation system.",
