  "abstract": "Quantum networks offer a realistic and practical scheme for generating multiparticle entanglement and implementing multiparticle quantum communication protocols. However, the correlations that can be generated in networks with quantum sources and local operations are not yet well understood. Covariance matrices, which are powerful tools in entanglement theory, have been also applied to the network scenario. We present simple proofs for the decomposition of such matrices into the sum of positive semidefinite block matrices and, based on that, develop analytical and computable necessary criteria for preparing states in quantum networks. These criteria can be applied to networks in which any two nodes share at most one source, such as all bipartite networks.",
