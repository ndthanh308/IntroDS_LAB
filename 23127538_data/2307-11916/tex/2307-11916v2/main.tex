\begin{abstract}
Robust spin-photon interfaces in solids are essential components in quantum networking and sensing technologies. Ideally, these interfaces combine a long-lived spin memory, coherent optical transitions, fast and high-fidelity spin manipulation, and straightforward device integration and scaling. The tin-vacancy center (SnV) in diamond is a promising spin-photon interface with desirable optical and spin properties at \SI{1.7}{\kelvin}. However, the SnV spin lacks efficient microwave control and its spin coherence degrades with higher temperature. In this work, we introduce a new platform that overcomes these challenges -- SnV centers in uniformly strained thin diamond membranes. The controlled generation of crystal strain introduces orbital mixing that allows microwave control of the spin state with \SI{99.36\pm0.09}{\percent} gate fidelity and spin coherence protection beyond a millisecond. Moreover, the presence of crystal strain suppresses temperature dependent dephasing processes, leading to a considerable improvement of the coherence time up to \SI{223\pm10}{\micro\second} at \SI{4}{\kelvin}, a widely accessible temperature in common cryogenic systems. Critically, the coherence of optical transitions is unaffected by the elevated temperature, exhibiting nearly lifetime-limited optical linewidths. Combined with the compatibility of diamond membranes with device integration, the demonstrated platform is an ideal spin-photon interface for future quantum technologies.

\section*{Introduction}
Color centers in diamond are a leading platform in quantum technologies, key achievements such as the demonstration of a quantum register \cite{VanDerSar2012,taminiau2014,Stas2022}, distant entanglement generation between three nodes \cite{Pompili2021}, quantum teleportation \cite{Hermans2022}, along with myriad landmarks in quantum sensing \cite{Kucsko2013,Shi2018}. In recent years, group IV centers have gained much attention due to their excellent optical properties \cite{knall2022,bhaskar2017,martinez2022,narita2023,rugar2020,Wan2020,gorlitz2020,iwasaki2017tin}. Their $D_{3d}$ symmetry renders optical transitions insensitive to first-order charge noise \cite{desantis2021,aghaeimeibodi2021,Hepp2014}. Additionally, a favorable Debye Waller factor leads to the majority of photons being emitted into the zero-phonon line, critical for spin-photon entanglement \cite{Sipahigil2016}. However, the electronic structure of group IV centers -- a spin 1/2 system with two ground state orbital branches -- renders the electron spin susceptible to phonon-driven transitions between the two branches \cite{Jahnke2015}. This temperature-dependent spin dephasing can be mitigated by operating at millikelvin temperatures \cite{becker2018,Sukachev2017} or by engineering the local phonon density of states through nanostructuring \cite{Meesala2018,Sohn2018}. Alternatively, dephasing can be mitigated by qubit engineering such as working with group IV centers with high spin-orbit coupling and thus large orbital splitting \cite{Trusheim2020}, or by leveraging spin-strain interaction in randomly-, or controllably strained group IV centers\cite{Stas2022,Sohn2018}. With a spin-orbit coupling significantly higher than those of the silicon vacancy (SiV) and the germanium vacancy (GeV) centers, the SnV center has the highest reported spin coherence time at \SI{1.7}{\kelvin} \cite{Debroux2021}. However, efficient microwave (MW) control of group IV spins requires the magnitude of spin-strain interaction to be comparable with the spin-orbit interaction, which for SnV necessitates strain approaching \SI{0.1}{\percent}. This degree of strain is challenging to achieve in microelectrical mechanical structures (MEMS) such as diamond cantilevers, with reported values on the order of \SI{0.015}{\percent} \cite{Meesala2018}. Therefore, a controlled process to generate \SI{\approx0.1}{\percent} strain in diamond is desired to improve SnV qubit performance by both increasing the operational temperature and enabling efficient MW driving.

In this work, we utilize heterogeneous integration of diamond membranes to to generate strain-tuned SnVs. By bonding SnV incorporated pristine diamond membranes to a glass substrate, we leverage the heterogeneous thermal expansion coefficients of the two materials to generate a uniform, in-plane strain in the diamond to the order of \SI{0.1}{\percent}. This strain greatly increases the energy splitting between the two orbital levels of the SnV and induces orbital mixing in the spin ground state. We demonstrate MW manipulation of the spin with \SI{99.36\pm0.09}{\percent} Rabi fidelity at \SI{4.50\pm0.02}{\mega\hertz} for 24 dBm MW input power. At \SI{1.7}{\kelvin}, the implementation of dynamical decoupling allows the SnV to reach millisecond coherence time, which is largely preserved even at \SI{4}{\kelvin}, owing to the strain-induced increased ground state orbital splitting. In combination with near lifetime-limited optical linewidths up to \SI{7}{\kelvin}, our spin-photon interface is compatible with broadly utilized low-infrastructure and cost-effective portable cryogenic systems. Additionally, the demonstrated strained-membrane heterostructure maintains robustness and flexibility for additional photonic, electronic, and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) integration. Our SnV-based diamond membrane platform greatly reduces the technological barrier for establishing quantum nodes for networking.

\subsection*{SnVs in strained diamond}
This work relies on strain engineering to improve SnV qubit performance. First, we demonstrate that heterogeneous thermal expansion disparities between diamond and glass in a diamond-membrane heterostructure are sufficient to generate uniform strain of the magnitude necessary to beneficially impact SnV. The diamond membranes used in this work were generated via the ``smart-cut'' method combined with isotopically purified ($^{12}C$) overgrowth. The membrane thickness is nominally 150 nm, with pristine crystal quality and atomically smooth surfaces \cite{Guo2021}. To introduce a positive tensile strain inside the diamond membrane, we bond them onto \SI{500}{\micro\meter}-thick fused silica substrates---a material with a low thermal expansion coefficient ($< 1\times10^{-6}$\SI{}{\per\kelvin}) -- using a layer of hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ). The schematic of this strain generation method is shown in Figure \ref{fig1: strained SnV} (a). The device is then annealed at \SI{600}{\celsius}, beyond the temperature at which the HSQ solidifies to glass, bonding the heterostructure in a "zero-strain" condition \cite{Siew2000}. Due to the mismatch in thermal contraction between diamond and fused silica and the negligible thickness of the diamond membrane compared to that of the fused silica substrate, cooling down the device to cryogenic temperature regime generates a positive (tensile), static strain profile in the diamond membrane with an estimated magnitude of \SIrange{0.05}{0.1}{\percent} (see section 1.3 and 1.4 in SI for details). This passive, uniform, and membrane-compatible strain generation is complimentary to recent demonstrations of electromechanically-induced strain on suspended diamond beams \cite{Sohn2018,Dang2021}.

Figure \ref{fig1: strained SnV} (b) is the microscope image showing the layout of our diamond-membrane heterostructure device. Prior to the membrane bonding, we patterned and etched a \SI{5}{\micro\meter} deep trench on the fused silica to suspend part of the membrane and mitigate background fluorescence from the HSQ resist. To study MW control of the SnV centers, we patterned and deposited gold coplanar waveguides following membrane bonding.
 
The strain monotonically increases the orbital splitting of the SnV centers in the membranes, which can be directly verified in the photoluminescence (PL) spectra at \SI{1.7}{\kelvin}. The energy level diagram of the strained SnV is shown in Figure \ref{fig1: strained SnV} (c), highlighting the ground state orbital splitting ($\Delta_{gs}$) and the respective contributions of spin-orbit coupling, strain, and magnetic Zeeman interaction in purple, blue, and green boxes. Figure \ref{fig1: strained SnV} (d) compares the spectra of a strained (unstrained) SnV center in a diamond membrane (bulk diamond) with $\Delta_{gs} =$ \SI{\approx1300 (850)}{\giga\hertz}. This particular strained center is used in further optical, microwave and spin characterizations in this work. Remarkably, we note that all color centers in the membrane are comparably strained. As shown in Figure \ref{fig1: strained SnV} (e), we observed a distribution of the orbital branches splitting centered around \SI{1500}{\giga\hertz} across different devices with a minimum (maximum) value of \SI{1200 (1800)}{\giga\hertz}.  We carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations to compute strain-susceptibilities and characterize  the SnV spin-strain interaction (see SI); our results show that the increase of the splitting between orbital branches from \SI{850}{\giga\hertz} to \SI{\approx1500}{\giga\hertz} due to strain, corresponds to a diamond membrane strain magnitude of \SI{0.075}{\percent}(see section 1.2 in the SI for details). The consistent strain generation, in combination with our ability to perform additional integration and nanofabrication following membrane bonding \cite{Butcher2020,Guo2023}, highlights the robustness and versatility of our platform.

\subsection*{Optical properties of SnV under strain}
To investigate the potential of strained SnV as a spin-photon interface, we first verify that the symmetry of the defect is preserved even under considerable strain by characterizing the optical transitions as a function of the magnetic ($B$) field orientation. Using the $\langle 111\rangle$ crystallographic axis -- the high symmetry axis of the SnV as the reference, we rotate the $B$ field in both polar ($\theta$) and azimuthal ($\phi$) angles at the same magnitude (\SI{0.2}{\tesla}). The absolute energy splitting between the two spin-conserving transitions (A1-B2) with respect to $\theta$ and $\phi$ is shown in Figure \ref{fig2: optical property} (a), indicating that large splittings at moderate values of magnetic field are achievable which is ideal for later SnV spin initialization and control. Similarly to the unstrained case, we observe a $\phi$ rotational symmetry of the splitting with respect to $\langle 111\rangle$, which corresponds to the intrinsic spin quantization axis. We further verify that the polarization of the SnV transitions (i.e. dipole operator matrix elements) remain along the $\langle 111\rangle$ direction (see section 3.1 of the SI), as in the unstrained case \cite{Hepp2014}.

From the $B$-field scan of the strained SnV, we note that besides the normal A1-B2 splitting maximum along the quantization axis, an additional local maximum at $\theta=$\SI{90}{\degree} -- the equator plane perpendicular to the quantization axis -- is observed, with the relative A1-B2 position being inverted, as verified by coherent population trapping measurements (see SI). This differs from the unstrained case. The novel feature arises from the moderate crystal strain (comparable in magnitude to the spin-orbit coupling) which increases the difference in effective Zeeman shift between ground and excited states, mostly visible for a magnetic field orthogonal to the spin-orbit-dictated quantization axis. As is the case for moderately strained SiV centers \cite{Sukachev2017} for MW-based control, we roughly align the $B$-field towards the quantization axis to achieve highly cycling optical transitions with cyclicity reaching $\eta\approx2500$ (see section 4.2 of SI). We note that $\eta$ can be as low as 6 when the $B$ field is perpendicular to the quantization axis, which is ideal for Raman-based all-optical control of strained SnV (see section 4.3 of SI). Moreover, by comparing the dependence on $\theta$ of the A1-B2 splitting with calculated results, we are able to determine the Stevens reduction factor $g_L$ for ground and excited states mentioned in \cite{thiering2018ab}. This model is then used to explain the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) frequency of the strained SnV discussed below.

Additionally, our measurements reveal near-transform limited optical linewidths, thereby showing that the application of strain does not alter the excellent coherence properties of the optical transitions, as previously demonstrated with unstrained centers \cite{Trusheim2020,narita2023}. As shown in Figure \ref{fig2: optical property} (b), the \SI{20}{\second} average scan returns a mean linewidth of \SI{47.4\pm1.6}{\mega\hertz}, only \SI{40}{\percent} more than the lifetime-limited value of \SI{32.26\pm0.19}{\mega\hertz} (\SI{4.933\pm0.19}{\nano\second} optical lifetime, see section 3.2 of SI). The long term frequency stability of the \{A1, B2\} transitions returns a center frequency standard deviation of $\sigma_c=$\SI{23.8 \pm 0.1}{\mega\hertz} and a A1-B2 splitting standard deviation of $\sigma_s=$\SI{13.28 \pm 0.06}{\mega\hertz} (see section 3.4 of SI). This linewidth and peak stability is comparable to that of other measurements of group IV color centers in nanostructures \cite{Wan2020,Stas2022,rugar2021quantum} and thus confirms the excellent potential of these defects for quantum photonic applications.

The resolvable splitting and narrow optical transitions are crucial for the spin initialization and readout of the SnV qubit. The spin initialization curve with subtracted background is shown in Figure \ref{fig2: optical property} (c), indicating a fitted exponential decay constant of \SI{24.2\pm0.3}{\micro\second}. The initialization pulse duration was set to \SI{200}{\micro\second} allowing us to reach a fidelity of \SI{98.8}{\percent}. We note that with a cyclicity of over \SI{2500}{}, this platform is a prime candidate for single shot readout if the signal counts can be improved via on-chip structures (nanophotonics, fiber couplers or grating couplers, solid immersion lenses) \cite{Parker2023,Bhaskar2020,rugar2021quantum,fuchs2021,guney2021optimized,kuruma2021coupling} or external methods (microcavities) \cite{tomm2021,riedel2017,ruf2021}.

\subsection*{Efficient MW control of the SnV spin}
% Figure environment removed

A critical component of a spin-photon interface is high-fidelity spin control, commonly achieved through MW driving of the electron spin. In the case of group IV centers, a MW field can only drive the spin transition in the presence of strain \cite{Pingault2017,Meesala2018}. This arises due to the orthogonality of orbital states associated with the electron spin qubit of group IV centers \cite{Hepp2014}. Strain that is comparable in strength to spin-orbit coupling relaxes this orthogonality, enabling microwave control. SnV, with larger spin-orbit coupling (\SI{850}{\giga\hertz}) and smaller strain susceptibility than SiV and GeV, requires large crystal strain to meet this criteria. This strain requirement goes beyond the achievable magnitude demonstrated via active strain tuning \cite{Meesala2018} or implantation-induced strain \cite{Stas2022}.

To demonstrate efficient MW control, we utilize the nominal \SI{0.1}{\percent} crystal strain in the diamond membrane. We estimate an effective Landé factor $g$ of \SI{1.62}{} for the transverse microwave field with the external magnetic field roughly aligned to the SnV quantization axis (see section 2.1 in SI). This value is relatively high compared with spin-orbit-dominated regime for unstrained centers (\SI{\leq0.3}{}) and is close to the free electron value ($g=2$). In addition, we tapered the MW waveguide around the measurement area by shrinking its width to \SI{6}{\micro\meter} to enhance the microwave amplitude, as shown in Figure \ref{fig1: strained SnV} (b). The distance between the target SnV and the waveguide is \SI{\approx4}{\micro\meter}, ensuring an efficient exposure to the MW driving field (see section 2.1 - 2.3 in SI for details).

We begin the MW control characterization by initializing the spin via optical pumping and scan the frequency of a MW field across the expected spin resonance while monitoring the fluorescence intensity of the spin readout at \SI{1.7}{\kelvin}. In Figure \ref{fig3: spin control} (a) we observe clear signature of optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) for the target SnV center. The \SI{81.5}{\milli\tesla} external magnetic field is aligned to the quantization axis by polarisation measurements and 3D field scan. The ODMR shows a profile with two overlapping peaks separated by \SI{628\pm182}{\kilo\hertz}, indicating an interaction between the electronic spin of the SnV with another system in the vicinity, likely a [\ch{^{13}C}] nuclear spin or the electron spin of a P1 center. Further investigation is needed to understand the nature of this interaction. By driving both power-broadened ODMR transitions, we are able to resonantly manipulate the spin state of the SnV with a Rabi frequency $\Omega/2\pi$ of \SI{4.50\pm0.02}{\mega\hertz}. The Rabi oscillation curve and the chevrons (Rabi oscillations with varied driving frequency) are shown in Figure \ref{fig3: spin control} (b) and (c). We observe a long-time averaged Rabi $\pi$-gate fidelity of \SI{99.36\pm0.09}{\percent}, improving significantly from previously demonstrated optical Raman-based spin control value \cite{Debroux2021}. We note that the MW power delivered to the device is approximately 24 dBm (\SI{250}{\milli\watt}) which is comparable to previous demonstrations on strained SiV \cite{Stas2022}. We also characterized the power dependence of the Rabi rate. Starting from a linear dependence, the Rabi rate deviates to sub-linear when the power surpasses 24 dBm due to excessive heating (see section 2.4 in SI), which could be optimized by replacing gold with superconducting metals (such as niobium or NbTiN) to deliver the MW signal.

We further characterize the single qubit gate fidelity of MW control via randomized benchmarking. For this, we use the following set of Clifford gates: \{$I$, $\pi_x$, $\pi_y$, $\pi_x/2$, $-\pi_x/2$, $\pi_y/2$, $-\pi_y/2$\} (see section 5.1 in SI). To prevent excessive heating effect during benchmarking which would lead to undesired spin decoherence, we apply a slightly slower Rabi rate (\SI{2.8}{\mega\hertz}, 18 dBm) which requires no time buffer between gates. The benchmarking result is shown in Figure \ref{fig3: spin control} (d). We extract an average Clifford gate fidelity of \SI{97.7\pm0.1}{\percent}, indicating power efficient MW control with high fidelity under stringent randomized benchmarking.

\subsection*{SnV spin coherence properties}
We next utilize microwave control to characterize the SnV coherence at \SI{1.7}{\kelvin}. We perform a Ramsey measurement as shown in Figure \ref{fig4: coherence} (a). The Gaussian envelope of the Ramsey oscillations corresponds to a spin dephasing time $T_2^*$ of \SI{2.5\pm0.1}{\micro\second}. Similar to ODMR, we observe interaction with a proximal spin in the Ramsey measurement, and we verify that this does not originate from the detuning of the MW signal via phase dependent readout (see section 5.2 in SI). Possible decoherence sources could be nearby vacancies and defects in the diamond membrane, as well as surface spins from both sides of the membrane \cite{sangtawesin2019}. 

% Figure environment removed

Advanced pulse sequences, such as dynamical decoupling via CPMG (Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill) and XY pulse sequences \cite{delange2010,souza2011}, allow us to extend the spin coherence to millisecond timescales. The CPMG results are shown in Figure \ref{fig4: coherence} (b). The $T_{2,echo}$ returns a value of \SI{100\pm1}{\micro\second}, which is already longer than \SI{35.5\pm3.0}{\micro\second} measured using all-optical spin echo process (see section 4.3 and 4.4 in SI), in the absence of optically induced dephasing mechanisms. The $T_{2,CPMG128}$, comprising 128 refocusing microwave pulses, prolongs the SnV spin coherence to \SI{1.57\pm0.08}{\milli\second}. We note that with no signal normalization being applied, the CPMG figure indicates a high signal fidelity of \SI{\approx80}{\percent} for up to 128 pulses. Future developments on the MW driving fidelity including superconducting metals and faster Rabi pulses can further improve the signal fidelity to higher numbers of pulses. We plot the relationship between the $T_2$ and the number of CPMG or XY pulses $N$ in Figure \ref{fig4: coherence} (c) and fit it with $T_2 \sim N^{\beta}$. The fitting curve returns a sub-linear dependence with a $\beta$ factor of \SI{0.593\pm0.008}{}. We observed minimal $T_2$ differences between CPMG and XY sequences. XY sequences are more resilient to control pulse errors compared to CPMG \cite{souza2011}, verifying that the observed coherence is not limited by our control (see section 5.4 in SI).

\subsection*{Spin-photon interface at \SI{4}{\kelvin}}
Finally, we demonstrate that our strained SnV platform shows state-of-the-art spin coherence for Group IV color centers at \SI{4}{\kelvin}. For Group IVs, the dominant decoherence source of the electronic spin is the electron-phonon interaction (phonon-mediated decay) between orbital branches \cite{Jahnke2015, Pingault2017}. The electron-phonon interaction rate depends on the temperature-dependent phonon population and the energy splitting $\Delta_{gs}$ between orbital branches. Therefore, enhanced coherence of the group IV centers can be achieved via either cooling down to millikelvin temperature \cite{Sukachev2017,becker2018}, increased energy splitting by using heavier group IV elements \cite{Trusheim2020}, engineering of the phonon density of states \cite{Kuruma2023}, or strain engineering \cite{Sohn2018}. Here we utilize both a heavy element (Sn as compared to Si and Ge) and crystal strain in diamond to improve electron spin coherence at elevated temperatures.

The Rabi oscillation of the SnV at \SI{4}{\kelvin} is shown in Figure \ref{fig5: 4K properties} (a). The fidelity is characterized to be \SI{97.7\pm0.5}{\percent}, only slightly lower than the value at \SI{1.7}{\kelvin} due to background heating limitations. We characterize the average gate fidelity via randomized benchmarking at \SI{4}{\kelvin} using the same \SI{2.8}{\mega\hertz} Rabi rate, returning a gate fidelity of \SI{95.7\pm0.3}{\percent}, confirming the maintained high performance spin manipulation of the strained SnV at \SI{4}{\kelvin}.

% Figure environment removed

Equipped with high fidelity Rabi control, we investigate the spin coherence of the SnV centers at elevated temperatures. Due to the much larger splitting $\Delta_{gs}$ of the strained SnV (\SI{\approx1300}{\giga\hertz}) compared with bulk SnV (\SI{\approx850}{\giga\hertz}), electron-phonon dephasing onsets at higher temperatures. Figure \ref{fig5: 4K properties} (c) shows the $T_1^{\text{spin}}$, $T_2^*$, $T_{2,echo}$ and $T_{2,2XY8}$ versus temperature. Fitting the same $\beta$ factor in $T_2 \sim N^{\beta}$ using Hahn-echo and XY4 coherence times returns a value of \SI{0.391\pm0.008}{} at \SI{4}{\kelvin} and \SI{0.014\pm0.000}{} at \SI{4.5}{\kelvin}, indicating that the dominant decoherence mechanism becomes phonon-induced orbital transitions instead of the spin bath. 

From Figure \ref{fig5: 4K properties} (c) we notice a much lower dephasing time compared with the decay time $T_1^{\text{spin}}$ \cite{Rogers2014}. This feature originates from the fact that only spin-flipping transitions between the lower and upper orbital branch drive $T_1^{\text{spin}}$, whereas $T_2$ is sensitive to dephasing by the spin-conserving transitions due to different precession frequencies in the orbital branches \cite{Meesala2018}. In our case, the phonon transitions are highly cycling due to the aligned magnetic field. Nevertheless, $T_2^*$ at \SI{4}{\kelvin} remains at \SI{2.7\pm0.1}{\micro\second} -- comparable to the \SI{1.7}{\kelvin} value, and $T_{2,echo}$ only decreases slightly to \SI{74\pm2}{\micro\second}, with $T_{2,2XY8}$ reaching the depolarization-limited $T_2$ -- \SI{223\pm10}{\micro\second}. It is worth emphasizing that all of these are record high values for all group IV spin qubits at \SI{4}{\kelvin} to date.

To demonstrate the potential of the strained SnV center as a promising spin-photon interface at elevated temperature, we investigate the temperature dependence of the SnV optical coherence. As shown in Figure \ref{fig5: 4K properties} (d), we observe that the ZPL linewidth remains unchanged for both A1 and B2 transitions up to \SI{7}{\kelvin} with the maximum linewidth remaining below \SI{52\pm0.8}{\mega\hertz}---only \SI{60}{\percent} higher than lifetime-limited values. In the future, modest Purcell enhancement of SnV emission rates with on-chip nanophotonics or microcavities can generate fully lifetime-limited photons suitable for efficient entanglement generation.

\section*{Conclusions}
In this work, we demonstrate that SnV in strained diamond membranes is a promising platform for quantum technologies. We create simple heterostructures that leverage differences in thermal expansion to passively generate significant strain of \SI{0.05}{\percent} to \SI{0.1}{\percent} in diamond, enabling efficient, high fidelity microwave control of the SnV spin. The presence of the strain also suppresses the phonon-mediated decay and improves the spin coherence of the SnV at \SI{4}{\kelvin}, which greatly reduces the technological barrier for quantum networking applications. We reach a Rabi $\pi$ gate fidelity of  \SI{99.36\pm0.09}{\percent}  (\SI{97.7\pm0.5}{\percent}) with a randomized single qubit gate fidelity of \SI{97.7\pm0.1}{\percent} (\SI{95.7\pm0.3}{\percent}) at \SI{1.7}{\kelvin} (\SI{4}{\kelvin}). Dynamical decoupling sequences allow the SnV spin coherence to reach \SI{1.57\pm0.08}{\milli\second} at \SI{1.7}{\kelvin} and \SI{223\pm10}{\micro\second} at \SI{4}{\kelvin}. In the future this value can be further enhanced by generating higher strain through heterostructure optimization and/or additional active tuning. Our platform, derived from scalable diamond membrane generation, is compatible with further on-chip integration, such as microwave coplanar waveguides, integrated photonics \cite{Guo2023}, and MEMS. Finally, \SI{4}{\kelvin} cryostats are relatively affordable and less infrastructure-intensive in comparison to cryogen-free \SI{1.7}{\kelvin} and \SI{}{\milli\kelvin} dilution-fridge systems. Therefore, the demonstrated spin-photon interface at \SI{4}{\kelvin} can reduce barriers to widespread utilization and deployment of solid-state quantum technologies.
