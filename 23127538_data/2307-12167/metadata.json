  "abstract": "We propose an on-chip all-optical gyroscope based on nonlinear multi-resonant cavity quantum photonics in thin film $χ^{(2)}$ resonators -- Quantum-Optic Nonlinear Gyro or QONG in short. The key feature of our gyroscope is co-arisal and co-accumulation of quantum correlations, nonlinear wave mixing and non-inertial signals, all inside the same sensor-resonator. We theoretically analyze the Fisher Information of our QONGs under fundamental quantum noise conditions. Using Bayesian optimization, we maximize the Fisher Information and show that $\\sim 900\\times$ improvement is possible over the shot-noise limited linear gyroscope with the same footprint, intrinsic quality factors and power budget.",
