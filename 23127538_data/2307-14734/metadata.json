  "abstract": "The analysis of angular particle correlations can yield valuable insights into the initial state of matter in high-energy collisions, thereby potentially revealing the existence of Beyond the Standard Model scenarios such as Hidden Valley (HV). In this study, we focus on a QCD-like hidden sector with relatively massive HV quarks ($\\lesssim 100$~GeV) which might enlarge and strengthen azimuthal correlations of final-state SM hadrons. In particular, we study the formation and possible observation of \\textit{ridge-like} structures in the angular two-particle correlation function at future $e^+e^-$ colliders, with a much cleaner environment than in hadron colliders, such as the LHC.",
