  "abstract": "Despite the critical importance of Digital Transformation, up to 95% of initiatives fail to deliver expected business benefits. This paper explores the role of Business Architecture practices in enhancing digital transformation success. Using an adapted Balanced Scorecard approach and a Structural Equation Model (SEM), we analysed survey responses from 129 industry practitioners using a Partial Least Squares (PLS) approach. Our findings indicate that effective business architecture practices significantly improve business alignment, efficiency, service delivery, and strategic outcomes, leading to successful digital transformation. The study also validates factors proposed by AL-Malaise AL-Ghamdi (2017) in the context of digital transformation. The paper presents an adapted conceptual model addressing discriminant validity issues in previous models and benefiting from the robustness of the Balanced Scorecard approach. The study concludes by highlighting the essential role of business architecture in driving digital transformation success.",
