  "abstract": "AI is getting more involved in tasks formerly exclusively assigned to humans. Most of research on perceptions and social acceptability of AI in these areas is mainly restricted to the Western world. In this study, we compare trust, perceived responsibility, and reliance of AI and human experts across OECD and Indian sample. We find that OECD participants consider humans to be less capable but more morally trustworthy and more responsible than AI. In contrast, Indian participants trust humans more than AI but assign equal responsibility for both types of experts. We discuss implications of the observed differences for algorithmic ethics and human-computer interaction.",
