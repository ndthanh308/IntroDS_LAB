abstract = {Clinical decision support tools (DST) promise improved healthcare outcomes by offering
data-driven insights. While effective in lab settings, almost all DSTs have failed
in practice. Empirical research diagnosed poor contextual fit as the cause. This paper
describes the design and field evaluation of a radically new form of DST. It automatically
generates slides for clinicians' decision meetings with subtly embedded machine prognostics.
This design took inspiration from the notion of Unremarkable Computing, that by augmenting
the users' routines technology/AI can have significant importance for the users yet
remain unobtrusive. Our field evaluation suggests clinicians are more likely to encounter
and embrace such a DST. Drawing on their responses, we discuss the importance and
intricacies of finding the right level of unremarkableness in DST design, and share
lessons learned in prototyping critical AI systems as a situated experience.},

abstract = {While artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly applied for decision-making processes, ethical decisions pose challenges for AI applications. Given that humans cannot always agree on the right thing to do, how would ethical decision-making by AI systems be perceived and how would responsibility be ascribed in human-AI collaboration? In this study, we investigate how the expert type (human vs. AI) and level of expert autonomy (adviser vs. decider) influence trust, perceived responsibility, and reliance. We find that participants consider humans to be more morally trustworthy but less capable than their AI equivalent. This shows in participants’ reliance on AI: AI recommendations and decisions are accepted more often than the human expert’s. However, AI team experts are perceived to be less responsible than humans, while programmers and sellers of AI systems are deemed partially responsible instead.},
