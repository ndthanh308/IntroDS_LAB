  "abstract": "A spatial-frequency thin-film filter with inclusions of nanoparticles operating in the visible range of the spectrum is investigated. The effect of nanoparticles embedded in the central and lateral layers of the frustrated total internal reflection filter on the spectral characteristics, taking into account the frequency dispersion, is investigated. It is shown that plasmonic effects cause splitting of the filter bandwidth into a set of narrow-band spectral lines and angular splitting of the incident beam into a set of output beams.",
