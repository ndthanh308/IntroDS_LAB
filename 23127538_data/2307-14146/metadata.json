  "abstract": "In this paper we give a field theory explanation of two confining dualities that have been proposed in the literature based on exact results from supersymmetric localization. The first confining model under investigation is 4d $SU(N_c+1)$ SQCD with a conjugate rank-$2$ anti-symmetric tensor, $N_c+3$ anti-fundamentals, $2N_c$ fundamentals and a superpotential that couples the anti-symmetric tensor and the fundamentals. The second confining model studied here is $3d$ $\\mathcal{N}=2$ $USp(4)$ gauge SQCD with two fundamentals, two rank-$2$ anti-symmetric tensors and vanishing superpotential. Here we prove that these models are confining by using the technique of deconfining the anti-symmetric tensors and then by flowing to the IR description by sequential dualities. As a bonus the analysis provides (alternative) proofs of the identities obtained from supersymmetric localization.",
