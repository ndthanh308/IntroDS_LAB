  "abstract": "Although non-intuitive, an accelerated electron along a particular trajectory can be shown to emit classical electromagnetic radiation in the form of a Fermi-Dirac spectral distribution when observed in a particular angular regime. We investigate the relationship between the distribution, spectrum, and particle count. The result for the moving point charge is classical, as it accelerates along an exactly known trajectory. We map to the semi-classical regime of the moving mirror model with a quantized spin-0 field. The scalars also possess a $β$ Bogoliubov coefficient distribution with Fermi-Dirac form in the respective frequency regime.",
