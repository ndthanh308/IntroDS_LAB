  "abstract": "In this short note, we prove an $L^6$-control of the macroscopic part of the linear Boltzmann and Landau equations. This result is an extension of the test function method of Esposito-Guo-Kim-Marra~\\cite{EGKM}\\cite{EGKM2} to the specular reflection boundary condition, in which we crucially used the Korn's inequality \\cite{DV2} and the system of symmetric Poisson equations \\cite{Bernou}.",
