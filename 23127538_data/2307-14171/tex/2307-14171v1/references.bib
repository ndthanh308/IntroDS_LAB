Here we evaluate the dose efficiency of phase contrast imaging with electron ptychography. The method is found to be far more resilient to temporal incoherence than conventional and spherical aberration optimized phase contrast imaging, resulting in significantly greater clarity at a given dose. This robustness is explained by the presence of achromatic lines in the four dimensional ptychographic dataset.}

abstract = {Four dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D STEM) records the scattering of electrons in a material in great detail. The benefits offered by 4D STEM are substantial, with the wealth of data it provides facilitating for instance high precision, high electron dose efficiency phase imaging via centre of mass or ptychography based analysis. However the requirement for a 2D image of the scattering to be recorded at each probe position has long placed a severe bottleneck on the speed at which 4D STEM can be performed. Recent advances in camera technology have greatly reduced this bottleneck, with the detection efficiency of direct electron detectors being especially well suited to the technique. However even the fastest frame driven pixelated detectors still significantly limit the scan speed which can be used in 4D STEM, making the resulting data susceptible to drift and hampering its use for low dose beam sensitive applications. Here we report the development of the use of an event driven Timepix3 direct electron camera that allows us to overcome this bottleneck and achieve 4D STEM dwell times down to 100 ns; orders of magnitude faster than what has been possible with frame based readout. We characterize the detector for different acceleration voltages and show that the method is especially well suited for low dose imaging and promises rich datasets without compromising dwell time when compared to conventional STEM imaging.}

Indirectly measuring the charge density of bulk materials is possible through X-ray or electron diffraction techniques by fitting their structure factors&lt;sup&gt;1-3&lt;/sup&gt;, but only if the sample is perfectly homogeneous within the area illuminated by the beam. Meanwhile, scanning tunnelling microscopy and atomic force microscopy enable us to see chemical bonds, but only on the surface&lt;sup&gt;4-6&lt;/sup&gt;. It remains a challenge to resolve charge density in nanostructures and functional materials with imperfect crystalline structures-such as those with defects, interfaces or boundaries at which new physics emerges. Here we describe the development of a real-space imaging technique that can directly map the local charge density of crystalline materials with sub-ångström resolution, using scanning transmission electron microscopy alongside an angle-resolved pixellated fast-electron detector. Using this technique, we image the interfacial charge distribution and ferroelectric polarization in a SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; heterojunction in four dimensions, and discover charge accumulation at the interface that is induced by the penetration of the polarization field of BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. We validate this finding through side-by-side comparison with density functional theory calculations. Our charge-density imaging method advances electron microscopy from detecting atoms to imaging electron distributions, providing a new way of studying local bonding in crystalline solids.},

They correspond to the integrated intensity over the atomic column and they outperform other measures. As compared to atomic column peak intensities, which saturate at a given thickness, scattering cross-sections increase monotonically. A study of the electron wave propagation is presented to explain the sensitivity of the scattering cross-sections. Based on the multislice algorithm, we analyse the wave propagation inside the crystal and its link to the scattered signal for the different probe positions contained in the scattering cross-section for detector collection in the low-, middle- and high-angle regimes. The influence to the signal from scattering of neighbouring columns is also discussed.}

It is based upon the calibration of the detector and the measurement of scattered intensities. Due to the predominantly incoherent nature of HAADF STEM, it is found to be robust to parameters that affect probe size and shape such as defocus and source coherence. The main imaging parameter dependencies are on detector angle and accelerating voltage, which are well known. The robustness to variation in other parameters allows for a quantitative comparison of experimental data and simulation without the need to fit parameters. By demonstrating the application of the PICS to the chemical identification of single atoms in a heterogeneous catalyst and in thin, layered-materials, we explore some of the experimental considerations when using this approach.}

abstract = {Electron ptychography is a 4-D STEM phase-contrast imaging technique with applications to light-element and beam-sensitive materials. Although the electron dose (electrons incident per unit area on the sample) is the primary figure of merit for imaging beam-sensitive materials, it is also necessary to consider the contrast transfer properties of the imaging technique. Here, we explore the contrast transfer properties of electron ptychography. The contrast transfer of focused-probe, non-iterative electron ptychography using the single-side-band (SSB) method is demonstrated experimentally. The band-pass nature of the phase-contrast transfer function (PCTF) for SSB ptychography places strict limitations on the probe convergence semi-angles required to resolve specific sample features with high contrast. The PCTF of the extended ptychographic iterative engine (ePIE) is broader than that for SSB ptychography, although when both high and low spatial frequencies are transferred, band-pass filtering is required to remove image artefacts. Normalisation of the transfer function with respect to the noise level shows that the transfer window is increased while avoiding noise amplification. Avoiding algorithms containing deconvolution steps may also increase the dose-efficiency of ptychographic phase reconstructions.}

Compared to other STEM phase contrast modes including annular bright field (ABF) and differential phase contrast (DPC), we show that the ptychographic phase reconstruction method using pixelated detectors offers the highest contrast transfer efficiency and superior low dose performance. Applying the ptychographic reconstruction method to DPC segmented detectors also improves the detector contrast transfer and results in less noisy images than DPC images formed using difference signals. We also find that using a minimum array of 16×16 pixels is sufficient to provide the highest signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for imaging beam sensitive weak phase objects. Finally, the convergence angle can be adjusted to enhance the contrast transfer based on the spatial frequencies of the specimen under study.}

Here we rely on a hardware aberration corrector to eliminate aberrations, but use the pixelated detector data set to utilize the largest possible volume of Fourier space to create high efficiency phase contrast images. The use of ptychography to diagnose the effects of chromatic aberration is also demonstrated. Finally, the four dimensional dataset is used to compare different bright field detector configurations from the same scan for a sample of bilayer graphene. Our method of high efficiency ptychography produces the clearest images, while annular bright field produces almost no contrast for an in-focus aberration-corrected probe.}

Here, we show that matching a simulation to an experimental image by iterative optimization provides a reliable analysis of atomic intensities even in presence of residual non-round aberrations. We compare our new method with other established approaches demonstrating its high reliability for images recorded at limited dose and with different aberrations. This is of particular relevance for analyzing moderately beam-sensitive materials, such as most 2D materials, where the limited sample stability often makes it difficult to obtain spectroscopic information at atomic resolution.}

The method is based on a quantification of the total intensity of the scattered electrons for the individual atomic columns using statistical parameter estimation theory. In order to apply this theory, a model is required describing the image contrast of the HAADF STEM images. Therefore, a simple, effective incoherent model has been assumed which takes the probe intensity profile into account. The scattered intensities can then be estimated by fitting this model to an experimental HAADF STEM image. These estimates are used as a performance measure to distinguish between different atomic column types and to identify the nature of unknown columns with good accuracy and precision using statistical hypothesis testing. The reliability of the method is supported by means of simulated HAADF STEM images as well as a combination of experimental images and electron energy-loss spectra. It is experimentally shown that statistically meaningful information on the composition of individual columns can be obtained even if the difference in averaged atomic number Z is only 3. Using this method, quantitative mapping at atomic resolution using HAADF STEM images only has become possible without the need of simultaneously recorded electron energy loss spectra.}

Here, we propose an alternative method to measure the source size broadening making use of a holographic biprism to create interference patterns in an ‘empty’ Ronchigram. This allows us to measure the exact shape of the source size broadening with a much better sampling than previously possible. We find that the shape of the demagnified source deviates considerably from a Gaussian profile that is often assumed. We fit the profile with a linear combination of a Gaussian and a bivariate Cauchy distribution showing that even though the full width at half maximum is similar to previously reported measurements, the tails of the profile are considerable wider. This is of fundamental importance for quantitative comparison of STEM simulations with experiments as these tails make the image contrast dependent on the interatomic distance, an effect that cannot be reproduced by a single Gaussian profile of fixed width alone.}

With an algorithm requiring only the center of mass of the diffraction pattern at one probe position at a time, it is able to update the resulting image each time a new probe position is visited without storing any intermediate diffraction patterns. The results show clear features at high spatial frequency, such as atomic column positions. It is also demonstrated that some common post-processing methods, such as band-pass filtering, can be directly integrated in the real-time processing flow. Compared with other reconstruction methods, the proposed method produces high-quality reconstructions with good noise robustness at extremely low memory and computational requirements. An efficient, interactive open source implementation of the concept is further presented, which is compatible with frame-based, as well as event-based camera/file types. This method provides the attractive feature of immediate feedback that microscope operators have become used to, for example, conventional high-angle annular dark field STEM imaging, allowing for rapid decision-making and fine-tuning to obtain the best possible images for beam-sensitive samples at the lowest possible dose.}",

abstract = {It has been known since the 1970s that the movement of the center of mass (COM) of a convergent beam electron diffraction (CBED) pattern is linearly related to the (projected) electrical field in the sample. We re-derive a contrast transfer function (CTF) for a scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) imaging technique based on this movement from the point of view of image formation and continue by performing a two-dimensional integration on the two images based on the two components of the COM movement. The resulting integrated COM (iCOM) STEM technique yields a scalar image that is linear in the phase shift caused by the sample and therefore also in the local (projected) electrostatic potential field of a thin sample. We confirm that the differential phase contrast (DPC) STEM technique using a segmented detector with 4 quadrants (4Q) yields a good approximation for the COM movement. Performing a two-dimensional integration, just as for the COM, we obtain an integrated DPC (iDPC) image which is approximately linear in the phase of the sample. Beside deriving the CTFs of iCOM and iDPC, we clearly point out the objects of the two corresponding imaging techniques, and highlight the differences to objects corresponding to COM-, DPC-, and (HA) ADF-STEM. The theory is validated with simulations and we present first experimental results of the iDPC-STEM technique showing its capability for imaging both light and heavy elements with atomic resolution and a good signal to noise ratio (SNR).}

abstract = {This book provides a summary of methods for numerical computation of high resolution conventional and scanning transmission electron microscope images. At the limits of resolution, image artifacts due to the instrument and the specimen interaction can complicate image interpretation. Image calculations can help interpret and understand high resolution information in recorded electron micrographs. This revised edition contains new sections on recent instrumental developments and updated references. It should be useful for beginning and experienced users at the advanced undergraduate or graduate level. This new edition will be a revision of the existing text, including new developments in this field since the original manuscript and updated references. Additional material will include abberration corrected instruments and confocal electron microscopy. The references and examples will be improved and expanded and some sections polished to improve ease of understanding.},

abstract = {The simulation of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images or diffraction patterns is often required to interpret their contrast and extract specimen features. This is especially true for high-resolution phase-contrast imaging of materials, but electron scattering simulations based on atomistic models are widely used in materials science and structural biology. Since electron scattering is dominated by the nuclear cores, the scattering potential is typically described by the widely applied independent atom model. This approximation is fast and fairly accurate, especially for scanning TEM (STEM) annular dark-field contrast, but it completely neglects valence bonding and its effect on the transmitting electrons. However, an emerging trend in electron microscopy is to use new instrumentation and methods to extract the maximum amount of information from each electron. This is evident in the increasing popularity of techniques such as 4D-STEM combined with ptychography in materials science, and cryogenic microcrystal electron diffraction in structural biology, where subtle differences in the scattering potential may be both measurable and contain additional insights. Thus, there is increasing interest in electron scattering simulations based on electrostatic potentials obtained from first principles, mainly via density functional theory, which was previously mainly required for holography. In this Review, we discuss the motivation and basis for these developments, survey the pioneering work that has been published thus far, and give our outlook for the future. We argue that a physically better justified ab initio description of the scattering potential is both useful and viable for an increasing number of systems, and we expect such simulations to steadily gain in popularity and importance.}

abstract = {This study sheds light on the prerequisites, possibilities, limitations and interpretation of high-resolution differential phase contrast (DPC) imaging in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). We draw particular attention to the well-established DPC technique based on segmented annular detectors and its relation to recent developments based on pixelated detectors. These employ the expectation value of the momentum transfer as a reliable measure of the angular deflection of the STEM beam induced by an electric field in the specimen. The influence of scattering and propagation of electrons within the specimen is initially discussed separately and then treated in terms of a two-state channeling theory. A detailed simulation study of GaN is presented as a function of specimen thickness and bonding. It is found that bonding effects are rather detectable implicitly, e.g., by characteristics of the momentum flux in areas between the atoms than by directly mapping electric fields and charge densities. For strontium titanate, experimental charge densities are compared with simulations and discussed with respect to experimental artifacts such as scan noise. Finally, we consider practical issues such as figures of merit for spatial and momentum resolution, minimum electron dose, and the mapping of larger-scale, built-in electric fields by virtue of data averaged over a crystal unit cell. We find that the latter is possible for crystals with an inversion center. Concerning the optimal detector design, this study indicates that a sampling of 5mrad per pixel is sufficient in typical applications, corresponding to approximately 10×10 available pixels.}

	Abstract = {Using state of the art scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) it is nowadays possible to directly image single atomic columns at sub-Å resolution. In standard (high angle) annular dark field STEM ((HA)ADF-STEM), however, light elements are usually invisible when imaged together with heavier elements in one image. Here we demonstrate the capability of the recently introduced Integrated Differential Phase Contrast STEM (iDPC-STEM) technique to image both light and heavy atoms in a thin sample at sub-Å resolution. We use the technique to resolve both the Gallium and Nitrogen dumbbells in a GaN crystal in [[Formula: see text]] orientation, which each have a separation of only 63 pm. Reaching this ultimate resolution even for light elements is possible due to the fact that iDPC-STEM is a direct phase imaging technique that allows fine-tuning the microscope while imaging. Apart from this qualitative imaging result, we also demonstrate a quantitative match of ratios of the measured intensities with theoretical predictions based on simulations.},
