  "abstract": "Electron ptychography provides highly sensitive, dose efficient phase images which can be corrected for aberrations after the data has been acquired. This is crucial when very precise quantification is required, such as with sensitivity to charge transfer due to bonding. Drift can now be essentially eliminated as a major impediment to focused probe ptychography, which benefits from the availability of easily interpretable simultaneous Z-contrast imaging. However challenges have remained when quantifying the ptychographic phases of atomic sites. The phase response of a single atom has a negative halo which can cause atoms to reduce in phase when brought closer together. When unaccounted for, as in integrating methods of quantification, this effect can completely obscure the effects of charge transfer. Here we provide a new method of quantification that overcomes this challenge, at least for 2D materials, and is robust to experimental parameters such as noise, sample tilt.",
