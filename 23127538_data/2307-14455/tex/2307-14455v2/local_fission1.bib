abstract = {Synopsis
The “classical limits” (asymptotic expressions for large angular momenta) are investigated for a number of quantities. Some relations for Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and Racah coefficients for large angular momenta are derived. Classical analogues for the square of Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and the square of the Dmnl(0, ϑ, 0)-functions are proposed on the basis of their geometrical meaning. WKB-expressions are derived for Dmnl(φ, ϑ, ψ) starting from the Schrödinger equation for the symmetric top. These expressions include WKB-expressions for the spherical harmonics Ylm(ϑ, ψ). It is shown in which way these WKB-expressions are related to the classical analogues for the Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and Dmnl(φ, ϑ, ψ)-functions.}

	url = {http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0029558265900386},
	volume = {71},
	year = {1965},
	abstract = {In connection with nuclear fission we study the division of an idealized charged drop, using a simplified version of the liquid-drop model. The degrees of freedom essential to a discussion of the division of a charged drop and the separation of the fragments to infinity are taken into account: a fragment-separation coordinate, a mass-asymmetry coordinate, a deformation coordinate for each fragment and rotational coordinates for each fragment. To specify fragment deformation, the fragments are represented by spheroids; a nucleus prior to division is represented by two overlapping spheroids. The Hamiltonian for the idealized system consists of a sum of surface, Coulomb and kinetic energies. A study of the saddle-point energies and shapes calculated in this two-spheroid approximation indicates that the approximation is most useful for discussing the fission of elements lighter than about radium. On the basis of this model, we calculate probability distributions for certain observable characteristics of fission fragments at infinity --- their total translational kinetic energy, mass, individual excitation energies and individual angular momenta. This is done by applying standard static, dynamical and statistical methods to the Hamiltonian for the system. The present treatment, for the most part, is classical; quantum mechanics is considered only in the statistical-mechanics discussion of the behaviour of the system near the saddle point. The predictions of the model are compared with existing experimental data for distributions in fragment mass and total translational kinetic energy for nuclei lighter than radium. The comparisons are made without the use of any adjustable parameters. The theory is capable of accounting for the magnitudes of the most probable values and widths of the experimental distributions, as well as some, but not all, finer details of the distributions. The dependence of the experimental distributions upon nuclear temperature, and the dependence of the experimental most probable kinetic energies upon the fissility parameter are also approximately reproduced by the calculations.},

General expressions are obtained for the corresponding transport coefficients by modelling the dinuclear system as two Fermi-Dirac gases in contact. The drift and diffusion coefficients are related by a generalized Einstein relation, reflecting the fluctuation-dissipation theorem; particular simplicity arises in the extreme quantal and classical limits. Application of the nuclear proximity method leads to simple factorized formulas valid for a certain general family of binary configurations relevant to nuclear collisions: the corresponding form factors can be estimated in a parameter-free semiclassical (Thomas-Fermi) mean-field model of nuclei. A simulation method is suggested for the numerical solution of the ensuing multi-dimensional transport problem.},

	abstract = {The dynamical accumulation of angular momentum in the course of a damped nuclear reaction is studied within the framework of the nucleon exchange transport model. The dinuclear spin distribution is described by the mean values and the covariances of the two prefragment spins and their orbital angular momentum L. Using an intrinsic coordinate system aligned with the fluctuating direction of L, the equations of motion for the spin distribution are derived and discussed. The ultimate transformation to an externally defined reference frame is also discussed. The evolution of other observables and their coupling to the spin variables are included and, by integrating conditional distributions over all impact parameters, results are obtained for differential cross sections corresponding to a specified loss of relative kinetic energy. The characteristic features of the evolution of the spin distribution is discussed in detail. First the stationary solution of the equations of motion is considered and its different appearance in the various relevant coordinate systems is exhibited. The dynamical evolution is discussed in terms of the time-dependent relaxation times associated with the six different intrinsic modes of rotation in the disphere. Due to the relative smallness of the window size the positive modes will dominate (for not too long times), resulting in a predominantly positive correlation between the fragment spin fluctuations. Illustrative applications to cases of experimental interest are made and a critical discussion is given of other models addressing angular momentum in damped nuclear reactions.},

We use path integral methods of quantum field theory as well as explicit computations for the transverse Ising spin chain. In both cases, there is a maximum speed v  of propagation of signals. In general the entanglement entropy increases linearly with time t  up to , after which it saturates at a value proportional to , the coefficient depending on the initial state. This behaviour may be understood as a consequence of causality.},

	abstract = {Motivated by recent progress in electron quantum optics, we revisit the question of single-electron entanglement, specifically whether the state of a single electron in a superposition of two separate spatial modes should be considered entangled. We first discuss a gedanken experiment with single-electron sources and detectors, and demonstrate deterministic (i. e. without post-selection) Bell inequality violation. This implies that the single-electron state is indeed entangled and, furthermore, nonlocal. We then present an experimental scheme where single-electron entanglement can be observed via measurements of the average currents and zero-frequency current cross-correlators in an electronic Hanbury Brown--Twiss interferometer driven by Lorentzian voltage pulses. We show that single-electron entanglement is detectable under realistic operating conditions. Our work settles the question of single-electron entanglement and opens promising perspectives for future experiments.},

Jefferson Lab has dramatically expanded our knowledge of the high-momentum nucleons generated by short-range correlations, providing sufficient insight to model much of their impact on nuclear structure in neutron stars and in low- to medium-energy scattering observables, including neutrino oscillation measurements. These short-range correlations also seem related to the modification of the quark distributions in nuclei, and efforts to improve our understanding of the internal structure of these short-distance and high-momentum configurations in nuclei will provide important input on a wide range of high-energy observables. },

Here we show that by extending the Brueckner-Goldstone model, we can formulate a theory that goes beyond basic mean-field theories and that can be used for studying spectroscopies of dilute atomic gases in the strongly interacting regime. The model hosts well-defined quasiparticles and works across a wide range of temperatures and interaction strengths. The theory provides excellent qualitative agreement with the experiment. Comparing the predictions of the present theory with the mean-field Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory yields insights into the role of pair correlations, Tan's contact and the Hartree mean-field energy shift.},

While mean-field calculations provide detailed information on the nuclear shell structure for a wide range of nuclei, they do not capture the complete structure of nuclei, in particular the impact of small, dense structures in nuclei. The strong, short-range component of the nucleon--nucleon potential yields hard interactions between nucleons which are close together, generating a high-momentum tail to the nucleon momentum distribution, with momenta well in excess of the Fermi momentum. This high-momentum component of the nuclear wave-function is one of the most poorly understood parts of nuclear structure. Utilizing high-energy probes, we can isolate scattering from high-momentum nucleons, and use these measurements to examine the structure and impact of short-range nucleon--nucleon correlations. Over the last decade we have moved from looking for evidence of such short-range structures to mapping out their strength in nuclei and examining their isospin structure. This has been made possible by high-luminosity and high-energy accelerators, coupled with an improved understanding of the reaction mechanism issues involved in studying these structures. We review the general issues related to short-range correlations, survey recent experiments aimed at probing these short-range structures, and lay out future possibilities to further these studies.},

	abstract = {While mean-field approximations, such as the nuclear shell model, provide a good description of many bulk nuclear properties, they fail to capture the important effects of nucleon--nucleon correlations such as the short-distance and high-momentum components of the nuclear many-body wave function1. Here, we study these components using the effective pair-based generalized contact formalism2,3 and ab initio quantum Monte Carlo calculations of nuclei from deuteron to 40Ca (refs. 4--6). We observe a universal factorization of the many-body nuclear wave function at short distance into a strongly interacting pair and a weakly interacting residual system. The residual system distribution is consistent with that of an uncorrelated system, showing that short-distance correlation effects are predominantly embedded in two-body correlations. Spin- and isospin-dependent `nuclear contact terms'are extracted in both coordinate and momentum space for different realistic nuclear potentials. The contact coefficient ratio between two different nuclei shows very little dependence on the nuclear interaction model. These findings thus allow extending the application of mean-field approximations to short-range correlated pair formation by showing that the relative abundance of short-range pairs in the nucleus is a long-range (that is, mean field) quantity that is insensitive to the short-distance nature of the nuclear force.},

Ab initio calculations show that two-nucleon pair-densities exhibit strong spin and isospin dependence. However, such calculations are not available for all nuclei of current interest. We therefore provide a simple model, which involves combining the short and long separation distance behavior using a single blending function, to accurately describe the two-nucleon correlations inherent in existing ab initio calculations. We show that the salient features of the correlation function arise from the features of the two-body short-range nuclear interaction, and that the suppression of the pp and nn pair-densities caused by the Pauli principle is important. Our procedure for obtaining pair-density functions and correlation functions can be applied to heavy nuclei which lack ab initio calculations.},

	abstract = {The coordinate-space representation of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory is the method of choice to study weakly bound nuclei whose properties are affected by the quasiparticle continuum space. To describe such systems, we developed a three-dimensional Skyrme-Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov solver HFBFFT based on the existing, highly optimized and parallelized Skyrme-Hartree-Fock code Sky3D. The code does not impose any self-consistent spatial symmetries such as mirror inversions or parity. The underlying equations are solved in HFBFFT directly in the canonical basis using the fast Fourier transform. To remedy the problems with pairing collapse, we implemented the soft energy cutoff and pairing annealing. The convergence of HFB solutions was improved by a sub-iteration method. The Hermiticity violation of differential operators brought by Fourier-transform-based differentiation has also been solved. The accuracy and performance of HFBFFT were tested by benchmarking it against other HFB codes, both spherical and deformed, for a set of nuclei, both well-bound and weakly-bound.},

	abstract = {We describe the new version 4.0 of the code hfbtho that solves the nuclear Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov problem by using the deformed harmonic oscillator basis in cylindrical coordinates. In the new version, we have implemented the restoration of rotational, particle number, and reflection symmetry for even-even nuclei. The restoration of rotational symmetry does not require using bases closed under rotation. Furthermore, we added the SeaLL1 functional and improved the calculation of the Coulomb potential. Finally, we refactored the code to facilitate maintenance and future developments.

Program title: hfbtho v4.0 CPC Library link to program files: https://doi.org/10.17632/c5g2f92by3.2 Code Ocean capsule: https://codeocean.com/capsule/5389629 Licensing provisions: GPLv3 Programming language: Fortran 2003 Journal reference of previous version: R.N. P{\'e}rez, N. Schunck, R.-D. Lasseri, C. Zhang and J. Sarich, Comput. Phys. Commun. 220 (2017) 363 Does the new version supersede the previous version: Yes Reasons for the new version: This version adds new capabilities to restore broken symmetries and determine corresponding quantum numbers of even-even nuclei Summary of revisions:1.Angular momentum projection for even-even nuclei in a deformed basis;2.Particle number projection for even-even nuclei in the quasiparticle basis;3.Implementation of the SeaLL1 functional;4.Expansion of the Coulomb potential onto Gaussians;5.MPI-parallelization of a single hfbtho execution;6.Code refactoring. Nature of problem: hfbtho is a physics computer code that is used to model the structure of the nucleus. It is an implementation of the energy density functional (EDF) approach to atomic nuclei, where the energy of the nucleus is obtained by integration over space of some phenomenological energy density, which is itself a functional of the neutron and proton intrinsic densities. In the present version of hfbtho, the energy density is derived either from the zero-range Skyrme or the finite-range Gogny effective two-body interaction between nucleons. Nuclear superfluidity is treated at the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) approximation. Constraints on the nuclear shape allow probing the potential energy surface of the nucleus as needed, e.g., for the description of shape isomers or fission. A local scale transformation of the single-particle basis in which the HFB solutions are expanded provides a tool to properly compute the structure of weakly-bound nuclei. Restoration of the rotational, particle number, and reflection symmetry for even-even nuclei enables recovering the quantum numbers that are lost at the HFB approximation. Solution method: The program uses the axial harmonic oscillator (HO) or the transformed harmonic oscillator (THO) single-particle basis to expand quasiparticle wave functions. It iteratively diagonalizes the HFB Hamiltonian based on generalized Skyrme-like energy densities and zero-range pairing interactions or the finite-range Gogny force until a self-consistent solution is found. Lagrange parameters are used to impose constraints on HFB solutions, and their value is updated at each iteration from an approximation of the quasiparticle random phase approximation (QRPA) matrix. Symmetry restoration is implemented through standard projection techniques. Previous versions of the program were presented in [1-3]. Additional comments including restrictions and unusual features: Axial and time-reversal symmetries are assumed in HFB calculations; y-simplex symmetry and even particle numbers are assumed in angular momentum projection.

	abstract = {The theory of electron-nucleus interaction is reviewed and applied to the derivation of the cross-sections for elastic and quasi-electric scattering. A detailed survey of the available experimental data concerning the above processes is presented. The theoretical interpretation of the experimental data in terms of microscopic wave functions is thoroughly discussed and the effects of meson exchange currents are also considered. Finally, a discussion is presented on the problem of the effects of the so-called short-range correlations in electron scattering and the question as to whether a unified analysis of electron, photon and proton scattering from light nuclei at intermediate energies is at present possible is also discussed. Unlike previous reviews on electron scattering, in this article the attention is mainly focussed on the theoretical interpretation of the experimental data pertaining to the few-body systems, in terms of accurate solutions of the non-relativistic Schroedinger equation, and those pertaining to light nuclei in terms of approximate wave functions resulting from various types of linked cluster expansions based on the G matrix.},

These conditions are the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock condition, the requirement that the single-particle orbitals be maximum overlap orbitals, or generalized natural orbitals. The implications of the use of the latter two sets of single-particle functions are examined in detail. It is shown that these two different choices lead to the cancellation of different sets of diagrams in the linked-cluster expansions of various quantities of physical interest. Both sets of basis functions lead to definitions of the particle-hole matrix elements of U which in lowest order coincide with each other, and with that obtained from the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock condition. The definition of the hole-hole matrix elements of U, on the other hand, as obtained from the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock condition is not related to these two sets.},

	abstract = {We present an overview of low-momentum two-nucleon and many-body interactions and their use in calculations of nuclei and infinite matter. The softening of phenomenological and effective field theory (EFT) potentials by renormalization group (RG) transformations that decouple low and high momenta leads to greatly enhanced convergence in few- and many-body systems, while maintaining a decreasing hierarchy of many-body forces. This review surveys the RG-based technology and results, discusses the connections to chiral EFT, and clarifies various misconceptions.},

	abstract = {A systematic review and theoretical analysis of the experimental data on multi GeV lepton, photon, hadron, deuteron (nucleus) reactions from nuclei forbidden in the case of scattering from free nucleons is presented. It is shown that all these data can be quantitatively described as a manifestation of short-range few nucleon correlations. Calculations for elastic and (deep)inelastic electromagnetic and weak form factors of the deuteron and other nuclei, are given. The inclusive production of leading particles in the nucleus fragmentation region in high-energy lepton, hadron or nucleus-induced collisions is analyzed. The straightforward correspondence between the Weinberg equation for the light-cone wave functions of the deuteron and the non-relativistic Schr{\"o}dinger equation is found. It is shown that the predictions of quantum chromodynamics for short-distance phenomena in nuclei are in agreement both with experimental data and theoretical expectations due to short range correlations in nuclei. Several feasible experiments are considered which could establish the existence of relativistic nuclear physics.},

Special attention is given to options at existing facilities and at facilities that will come into operation in the early nineties (the jet target facility at PEP and CEBAF). The importance of light-cone dynamics, the physics of large longitudinal distances, and the presence of point-like quark-gluon configurations in hadrons for the theoretical description of high-energy processes (and especially nuclear shadowing) is explained. Ways to investigate the interrelations between perturbative and nonperturbative QCD in nuclear shadowing are suggested. Options for probing the hard scattering wave functions of hadrons are analysed.},

	abstract = {The physics of atomic quantum gases is currently taking advantage of a powerful tool, the possibility to fully adjust the interaction strength between atoms using a magnetically controlled Feshbach resonance. For fermions with two internal states, formally two opposite spin states, this allows to prepare long lived strongly interacting three-dimensional gases and to study the BEC-BCS crossover. Of particular interest along the BEC-BCS crossover is the so-called unitary gas, where the atomic interaction potential between the opposite spin states has virtually an infinite scattering length and a zero range. This unitary gas is the main subject of the present chapter: It has fascinating symmetry properties, from a simple scaling invariance, to a more subtle dynamical symmetry in an isotropic harmonic trap, which is linked to a separability of the N-body problem in hyperspherical coordinates. Other analytical results, valid over the whole BEC-BCS crossover, are presented, establishing a connection between three recently measured quantities, the tail of the momentum distribution, the short range part of the pair distribution function and the mean number of closed channel molecules.},

Numerical results for the projection after variation method are shown for the nucleus 164Er and for the projection before variation approach for the nuclei 48,50Cr.

The Balian--Br{\'e}zin decomposition of the unitary operator [R. Balian, E. Br{\'e}zin, Il Nuovo Cimento B 64 (1969) 37] is employed in the derivation. We found that this decomposition is extremely suitable for an application of Fermion coherent state and Grassmann integrals in the quasi-particle basis. The resultant formula is compactly expressed in terms of the Pfaffian, and shows the similar bipartite structure to the formula that we have previously derived in the bare-particles basis [T. Mizusaki, M. Oi, Phys. Lett. B 715 (2012) 219].},

	abstract = {The generator coordinate method is applied to the transition region nuclei. Using the de deformation parameter as a generator coordinate, the trial wave function is constructed by superposing shell-model wave functions with various varues of the deformation parameter. For simplicity the deformation is restricted to be axially symmetric, and the pairing correlation is taken into account by using a BCS type shell-model wave function. The generator wave function which serves as a weight function may be obtained by solving an integral equation derived through the variational principle. In the integral equation there appear overlap and energy kernels, which are matrix elements between shell-model wave functions with different values of the deformation parameter. In calculating the kernels a new method is presented. The BCS type wave function is expressed in a more suitable form to practical calculations and the matrix elements are obtained in a simple and compact form without any approximation.},

	abstract = {For the overlap matrix element between Hartree--Fock--Bogoliubov states, there are two analytically different formulae: one with the square root of the determinant (the Onishi formula) and the other with the Pfaffian (Robledo's Pfaffian formula). The former formula is two-valued as a complex function, hence it leaves the sign of the norm overlap undetermined (i.e., the so-called sign problem of the Onishi formula). On the other hand, the latter formula does not suffer from the sign problem. The derivations for these two formulae are so different that the reasons are obscured why the resultant formulae possess different analytical properties. In this paper, we discuss the reason why the difference occurs by means of the consistent framework, which is based on the linked cluster theorem and the product-sum identity for the Pfaffian. Through this discussion, we elucidate the source of the sign problem in the Onishi formula. We also point out that different summation methods of series expansions may result in analytically different formulae.},

The model is a completely combinatorial (micro-canonical) model based on the folded-Yukawa single-particle potential and includes explicit treatment of pairing, rotational and vibrational states. The microscopic character of all states enables extraction of level-distribution functions with respect to pairing gaps, parity and angular momentum. The results of the model are compared to available experimental data: level spacings at neutron separation energy, data on total level-density functions from the Oslo method, cumulative level densities from low-lying discrete states, and data on parity ratios. Spherical and deformed nuclei follow basically different coupling schemes, and we focus on deformed nuclei.},

The angular velocity is represented in the same way as in the work of Thouless, and if this is based on a fully self-consistent treatment the moment of inertia found for rotation about a fixed axis is the same as that found by Thouless. The three-dimensional case is treated by the same method. The method can be regarded as an extension of that of Peierls and Yoccoz, arranged to give in the translational problem exactly the correct kinetic energy of the centre-of-mass motion.},

This article describes the evaluation philosophy and procedures that were implemented in the selection of specific nuclear reaction, decay and mass-spectrometer results. These input values were entered in the least-squares adjustment procedure for determining the best values for the atomic masses and their uncertainties. Calculation procedures and particularities of the Ame are then described. All accepted and rejected data, including outweighed ones, are presented in a tabular format and compared with the adjusted values (obtained using the adjustment procedure). Differences with the previous Ame2003 evaluation are also discussed and specific information is presented for several cases that may be of interest to various Ame users. The second Ame2012 article, the last one in this issue, gives a table with recommended values of atomic masses, as well as tables and graphs of derived quantities, along with the list of references used in both this Ame2012 evaluation and the Nubase2012 one (the first paper in this issue).},

The quality of the results obviously depends on the experimental entry data, the theoretical and phenomenological models, and the various assumptions done in the code. The goal of this paper is to highlight new features of the code and to present some selected new results focusing on the use of a temperature-dependent spin cut-off, the prompt gamma de-excitation capability, a ROOT-based tool for the analysis of the FF histories, the estimation of correlated quantities, and so on. The influence of some experimental data on the neutron multiplicity and the influence of the level density parameter models on fission observables are also presented. Finally a preliminary result concerning the neutron spectrum for the 238U(n,f) reaction at 1.8 MeV is shown.},

	abstract = {The excitation mechanism of the fission process is studied in terms of a model of particles moving in a deformed time-dependent potential. A residual interaction of the pairing type is incorporated by means of the BCS approximation. Only two-quasi-particle excitations up to some cutoff energy are included. The separation of the total excitation energy into intrinsic and translational parts is made at the scission point. The present calculations for 240Pu show that, in the framework of this model, most of the available energy at scission is transformed into intrinsic excitation energy. However the convergence of the calculated value for the cutoff energy is unsatisfactory, and hence a description in terms of a better model space is needed. The fact that very many channels are involved suggests that a statistical treatment may be useful.},

The components are extracted from experimental measurements, where they exist, together with model-dependent calculation, interpolation, and extrapolation. While the components display clear dependencies upon the incident neutron energy, their sums display only weak, yet definite, energy dependencies. Also addressed is the total prompt energy deposition in fission for the same three systems. Results are presented in equation form. New measurements are recommended as a consequence of this study.},

Relative to our 1981 mass table the current results are obtained with an improved macroscopic model, an improved pairing model with a new form for the effective-interaction pairing gap, and minimization of the ground-state energy with respect to additional shape degrees of freedom. The values of only nine constants are determined directly from a least-squares adjustment to the ground-state masses of 1654 nuclei ranging from 16O to 263106 and to 28 fission-barrier heights. The error of the mass model is 0.669 MeV for the entire region of nuclei considered, but is only 0.448 MeV for the region N ≥65.},

A regularity common to all independent experiments is revealed: at an angle of about 90{\textdegree}, there exists an excess of neutrons (30{\%} for 252Cf and 60{\%} for 235U) that does not admit explanation within the model of neutron emission from fully accelerated fragments. Two possible explanations of this experimental fact---neutron emission during the acceleration process and the existence of an additional source of neutrons (predominantly, prescission neutrons)---are considered. It is shown that the latter conjecture describes the observed features for both nuclei more adequately. The total yield of prescission neutrons and their energy and angular distributions are determined.},

	abstract = {The goal of the present account is to review our efforts to obtain and apply a ``collective'' Hamiltonian for a few, approximately decoupled, adiabatic degrees of freedom, starting from a Hamiltonian system with more or many more degrees of freedom. The approach is based on an analysis of the classical limit of quantum-mechanical problems. Initially, we study the classical problem within the framework of Hamiltonian dynamics and derive a fully self-consistent theory of large-amplitude collective motion with small velocities. We derive a measure for the quality of decoupling of the collective degree of freedom. We show for several simple examples, where the classical limit is obvious, that when decoupling is good, a quantization of the collective Hamiltonian leads to accurate descriptions of the low energy properties of the systems studied. In nuclear physics problems we construct the classical Hamiltonian by means of time-dependent mean-field theory, and we transcribe our formalism to this case. We report studies of a model for monopole vibrations, of 28Si with a realistic interaction, several qualitative models of heavier nuclei, and preliminary results for a more realistic approach to heavy nuclei. Other topics included are a nuclear Born--Oppenheimer approximation for an ab initio quantum theory and a theory of the transfer of energy between collective and noncollective degrees of freedom when the decoupling is not exact. The explicit account is based on the work of the authors, but a thorough survey of other work is included.},

For this purpose it is necessary to derive the energy density of a Slater determinant without assuming the single-particle states to be invariant under time-reversal. The corresponding Hartree-Fock Hamiltonian is obtained by varying the total energy with respect to the single-particle density matrix. With the Skyrme interaction TDHF theory leads to an equation of continuity for the single-particle density. The ATDHF equation is transformed into a finite set of inhomogeneous differential equations. Hydrodynamic-like expressions for the collective kinetic energy are established in case the single-particle wave functions have certain generalised scaling properties. TDHF and ATDHF are applied to the description of isoscalar monopole vibrations in 16O and 40Ca.},

The method leads to a Hamiltonian for collective motion which separates into a potential and a kinetic energy and gives mass and potential parameters in terms of the nucleon-nucleon interaction. The adiabatic approximation assumes slow motion but not small amplitudes and can therefore describe anharmonic effects. The RPA is a limiting case where both amplitudes and velocities are small. The variational approach provides a consistent way of extracting coordinates and momenta from the density matrix and of obtaining equations of motion when particular trial forms for this density matrix are chosen. One such choice leads to Thouless-Valatin formula. An other choice leads to irrotational hydrodynamics.},

	abstract = {Within the framework of the unrestricted time-dependent density functional theory, we present for the first time an analysis of the relativistic Coulomb excitation of the heavy deformed open shell nucleus $^{238}$U. The approach is based on Superfluid Local Density Approximation (SLDA) formulated on a spatial lattice that can take into account coupling to the continuum, enabling self-consistent studies of superfluid dynamics of any nuclear shape. We have computed the energy deposited in the target nucleus as a function of the impact parameter, finding it to be significantly larger than the estimate using the Goldhaber-Teller model. The isovector giant dipole resonance, the dipole pygmy resonance and giant quadrupole modes were excited during the process. The one body dissipation of collective dipole modes is shown to lead a damping width $\Gamma_\downarrow \approx 0.4$ MeV and the number of pre-equilibrium neutrons emitted has been quantified.},

Fluctuations and dissipation originate in this approach from quantum jumps that occur randomly during the time evolution of the system. This approach can be applied to a wide class of relaxation operators in the Markovian regime, and it is equivalent to the standard master-equation approach. For systems with a number of states N much larger than unity this Monte Carlo wave-function approach can be less expensive in terms of calculation time than the master-equation treatment. Indeed, a wave function involves only N components, whereas a density matrix is described by N2 terms. We evaluate the gain in computing time that may be expected from such a formalism, and we discuss its applicability to several examples, with particular emphasis on a quantum description of laser cooling.},

It is shown that, for small amplitude fluctuations, the proposed model gives a result for the dispersion of a one-body observable that is identical to the result obtained previously through a variational approach. Furthermore, by projecting the proposed stochastic mean-field evolution on a collective path, a generalized Langevin equation is derived for collective variable, which incorporates one-body dissipation and one-body fluctuation mechanism in accordance with quantal fluctuation-dissipation relation.},

	abstract = {The physics of atomic quantum gases is currently taking advantage of a powerful tool, the possibility to fully adjust the interaction strength between atoms using a magnetically controlled Feshbach resonance. For fermions with two internal states, formally two opposite spin states, this allows to prepare long lived strongly interacting three-dimensional gases and to study the BEC-BCS crossover. Of particular interest along the BEC-BCS crossover is the so-called unitary gas, where the atomic interaction potential between the opposite spin states has virtually an infinite scattering length and a zero range. This unitary gas is the main subject of the present chapter: It has fascinating symmetry properties, from a simple scaling invariance, to a more subtle dynamical symmetry in an isotropic harmonic trap, which is linked to a separability of the N-body problem in hyperspherical coordinates. Other analytical results, valid over the whole BEC-BCS crossover, are presented, establishing a connection between three recently measured quantities, the tail of the momentum distribution, the short range part of the pair distribution function and the mean number of closed channel molecules.},

With this approach, we describe the generation and the real-time evolution and interaction of quantized vortices, the large-amplitude collective modes, as well as the loss of superfluidity at high flow velocities. We demonstrate the formation of vortex rings and provide a microscopic description of the crossing and reconnection of quantized vortex lines in a fermion superfluid, which provide the mechanism for the emergence of quantum turbulence at very low temperatures. We observe that superfluidity often survives when these systems are stirred with velocities far exceeding the speed of sound.},

	abstract = {At present there are two vastly different ab initio approaches to the description of the the many-body dynamics: the Density Functional Theory (DFT) and the functional integral (path integral) approaches. On one hand, if implemented exactly, the DFT approach can allow in principle the exact evaluation of arbitrary one-body observable. However, when applied to Large Amplitude Collective Motion (LACM) this approach needs to be extended in order to accommodate the phenomenon of surface-hoping, when adiabaticity is strongly violated and the description of a system using a single (generalized) Slater determinant is not valid anymore. The functional integral approach on the other hand does not appear to have such restrictions, but its implementation does not appear to be straightforward endeavor. However, within a functional integral approach one seems to be able to evaluate in principle any kind of observables, such as the fragment mass and energy distributions in nuclear fission. These two radically approaches can likely be brought brought together by formulating a stochastic time-dependent DFT approach to many-body dynamics.},
