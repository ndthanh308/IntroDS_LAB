  "abstract": "We employ N-$V$ magnetometry to measure the stray field dynamics of a ferromagnetic permalloy nanowire driven by spin-orbit torques. Specifically, we observe the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) signatures of both spontaneous DC-driven magnetic oscillations and phase-locking to a second harmonic drive, developing a simple macrospin model that captures the salient features. We also observe signatures of dynamics beyond the macrospin model, including an additional ODMR feature (associated with a second SW mode) and one mode sapping power from another. Our results provide additional insight into N-$V$-spin wave coupling mechanisms, and represent a new modality for sub-wavelength N-$V$ scanned probe microscopy of nanoscale magnetic oscillators.",
