   abstract = {Spintronics, or spin electronics, involves the study of active control and manipulation of spin degrees of freedom in solid-state systems. This article reviews the current status of this subject, including both recent advances and well-established results. The primary focus is on the basic physical principles underlying the generation of carrier spin polarization, spin dynamics, and spin-polarized transport in semiconductors and metals. Spin transport differs from charge transport in that spin is a nonconserved quantity in solids due to spin-orbit and hyperfine coupling. The authors discuss in detail spin decoherence mechanisms in metals and semiconductors. Various theories of spin injection and spin-polarized transport are applied to hybrid structures relevant to spin-based devices and fundamental studies of materials properties. Experimental work is reviewed with the emphasis on projected applications, in which external electric and magnetic fields and illumination by light will be used to control spin and charge dynamics to create new functionalities not feasible or ineffective with conventional electronics.},

   abstract = {Bloembergen and Wang, as well as Damon, have observed two anomalous effects in the microwave absorption of ferromagnets at high signal powers: a saturation of the usual resonance at powers far below those thought to be necessary on the basis of the observed relaxation time, and the appearance, at similar signal levels, of a rather broad secondary absorption peak some hundreds of oersteds below the d.c. field required for resonance. It is shown that these effects are connected with two kinds of instability of the uniform precessional motion of the total magnetization against certain spin-wave disturbances. These disturbances will grow, exponentially to begin with, when the signal level exceeds certain threshold values. It turns out to be possible to calculate the new final state attained by the medium in the case of the subsidiary absorption; in this state the uniform precession limits at a fixed value, no matter how large the signal, whereas a narrow range of spin waves is excited to a large nonthermal value which increases steadily with signal power. The susceptibilities calculated in the new regime check the experiments quite well. Some predictions of the theory beyond the above-mentioned observations have also been verified. A simplified, less rigorous treatment has already been given elsewhere. In the present paper a more complete theory is developed, with special emphasis on the new state of the medium beyond the threshold.},

Typically, relaxation rates are estimated with curve-fitting techniques that do not provide optimal sensitivity, often leading to long acquisition times that are particularly detrimental in systems prone to drift or other dynamics of interest. Here we show that adaptive Bayesian estimation is well suited to this problem, producing dynamic relaxometry pulse sequences that rapidly find an optimal operating regime. In many situations (including the system we employ), this approach can speed the acquisition by an order of magnitude. We also present a four-signal measurement protocol that is robust to drifts in spin readout contrast, polarization, and microwave pulse fidelity while still achieving near-optimal sensitivity. The combined technique offers a practical, hardware-agnostic approach for a wide range of N-V relaxometry applications.},

   abstract = {One long-standing goal in the emerging neuromorphic field is to create a reliable neural network hardware implementation that has low energy consumption, while providing massively parallel computation. Although diverse oxide-based devices have made significant progress as artificial synaptic and neuronal components, these devices still need further optimization regarding linearity, symmetry, and stability. Here, we present a proof-of-concept experiment for integrated neuromorphic computing networks by utilizing spintronics-based synapse (spin-S) and neuron (spin-N) devices, along with linear and symmetric weight responses for spin-S using a stripe domain and activation functions for spin-N. An integrated neural network of electrically connected spin-S and spin-N successfully proves the integration function for a simple pattern classification task. We simulate a spin-N network using the extracted device characteristics and demonstrate a high classification accuracy (over 93%) for the spin-S and spin-N optimization without the assistance of additional software or circuits required in previous reports. These experimental studies provide a new path toward establishing more compact and efficient neural network systems with optimized multifunctional spintronic devices. An array of low-power devices that mimic the behavior of the brain has been constructed by researchers in South Korea. The brain works by passing chemical and electrical signals across a network of cells called neurons, which are connected via synapses. Scientists want to create an artificial neural network to take advantage of the parallel way in which the brain processes information. YeonJoo Jeong from the Korea Institute of Science and Technology, Jin Pyo Hong from Hanyang University, both in Seoul, and their colleagues have demonstrated a proof-of-principle neuromorphic computing network using so-called spintronic devices. Spintronics are low-power devices that use the property of an electron called spin rather than its charge as in conventional electronics. The team’s neural network of electrically connected spin-synapses and spin-neurons successfully performed a simple pattern classification task. We introduced spintronics-based synapses (spin-S) by utilizing a stripe domain ensuring its highly linear and symmetric weight responses, together with domain-wall motion-based neurons (spin-N) for activation functions. In addition, a crossbar array architecture for the spin-S/N has been proposed and experimentally demonstrated. A simple pattern-classification task was tested using an integrated network of electrically connected spin-S and spin-N to mimic a human brain. Our experimental findings provide a new avenue toward establishing more efficient neural network systems with spintronic devices.},

   abstract = {Synchronization of large spin Hall nano-oscillator (SHNO) arrays is an appealing approach toward ultrafast non-conventional computing. However, interfacing to the array, tuning its individual oscillators and providing built-in memory units remain substantial challenges. Here, we address these challenges using memristive gating of W/CoFeB/MgO/AlOx-based SHNOs. In its high resistance state, the memristor modulates the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy at the CoFeB/MgO interface by the applied electric field. In its low resistance state the memristor adds or subtracts current to the SHNO drive. Both electric field and current control affect the SHNO auto-oscillation mode and frequency, allowing us to reversibly turn on/off mutual synchronization in chains of four SHNOs. We also demonstrate that two individually controlled memristors can be used to tune a four-SHNO chain into differently synchronized states. Memristor gating is therefore an efficient approach to input, tune and store the state of SHNO arrays for non-conventional computing models. This allows versatile non-volatile tuning of the mutual synchronization of chains of up to four oscillators and provides a path toward individual oscillator control in large oscillatory arrays.},

Newton, Scattering Theory of Waves and Particles (1982)], crystallography [U. Pietsch, V. Holý, T. Baumback, High-Resolution X-Ray Scattering (2004)], and the discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA [J. D. Watson, F. H. C. Crick, Nature 171, 737–738]. Scattering techniques differ by the type of particles used, the interaction these particles have with target materials, and the range of wavelengths used. Here, we demonstrate a two-dimensional table-top scattering platform for exploring magnetic properties of materials on mesoscopic length scales. Long-lived, coherent magnonic excitations are generated in a thin film of yttrium iron garnet and scattered off a magnetic target deposited on its surface. The scattered waves are then recorded using a scanning nitrogen vacancy center magnetometer that allows subwavelength imaging and operation under conditions ranging from cryogenic to ambient environment. While most scattering platforms measure only the intensity of the scattered waves, our imaging method allows for spatial determination of both amplitude and phase of the scattered waves, thereby allowing for a systematic reconstruction of the target scattering potential. Our experimental results are consistent with theoretical predictions for such a geometry and reveal several unusual features of the magnetic response of the target, including suppression near the target edges and a gradient in the direction perpendicular to the direction of surface wave propagation. Our results establish magnon scattering experiments as a platform for studying correlated many-body systems.},

Here, we use nanoscale control of a single-NV sensor as a wavelength filter to characterize frequency-degenerate spin waves excited by a microstrip in a thin-film magnetic insulator. With the NV probe in contact with the magnet, we observe an incoherent mixture of thermal and microwave-driven spin waves. By retracting the tip, we progressively suppress the small-wavelength modes until a single coherent mode emerges from the mixture. In-contact scans at low drive power surprisingly show occupation of the entire isofrequency contour of the two-dimensional spin-wave dispersion despite our one-dimensional microstrip geometry. Our distance-tunable filter sheds light on the spin-wave band occupation under microwave excitation and opens opportunities for imaging magnon condensates and other coherent spin-wave modes.},

   abstract = {Spin waves have risen as promising candidate information carriers for the next generation of information technologies. Recent experimental demonstrations of their detection using electron spins in diamond pave the way towards studying the back-action of a controllable paramagnetic spin bath on the spin waves. Here, we present a macroscopic quantum theory describing the interaction between spin waves and paramagnetic spins. As a case study, we consider an ensemble of nitrogen-vacancy spins in diamond in the vicinity of an yttrium-iron-garnet thin film. We show how the back-action of the ensemble results in strong and tuneable modifications of the spin wave spectrum and propagation properties. These modifications include the full suppression of spin wave propagation and, in a different parameter regime, the enhancement of their propagation length by ∼50% for modes near resonance with the NV transition frequency. Furthermore, we show how the spin wave thermal fluctuations-even down to the quantum magnonic ground state-induce a measurable frequency shift of the paramagnetic spins in the bath. This shift results in a thermal dispersion force that can be measured optically and/or mechanically with a diamond mechanical resonator. In addition, we use our theory to compute the spin wave-mediated interaction between the spins in the bath. We show that all the above effects are measurable by state-of-the-art experiments. Our results provide the theoretical foundation for describing hybrid quantum systems of spin waves and spin baths and establish the potential of quantum spins as active control, sensing, and interfacing tools for spintronics.},

We first investigate the behavior of the ESR contrast and linewidth as a function of the microwave and optical pumping power. The experimental results are in good agreement with a simplified model of the NV defect spin dynamics, leading to an optimized sensitivity around 2μT/√Hz for a single NV defect in a high-purity diamond crystal grown by chemical vapor deposition. We then demonstrate an enhancement of the magnetic sensitivity by one order of magnitude by using a simple pulsed-ESR scheme. This technique is based on repetitive excitation of the NV defect with a resonant microwave π pulse followed by an optimized readout laser pulse, allowing to fully eliminate power broadening of the ESR linewidth.

We use the amplitude of a spin wave to encode information and to guide it to one of the two outputs of the coupler depending on the signal magnitude, frequency and the applied magnetic field. Using micromagnetic simulations, we also propose an integrated magnonic half-adder that consists of two directional couplers and we investigate its functionality for information processing within the magnon domain.

However, the effectiveness of the technique when applied to magnetic nanostructures remains to be demonstrated.

Here, we show that the ferromagnetic vortex can be driven into proximity with a nitrogen-vacancy defect using small applied magnetic fields, inducing significant nitrogen-vacancy spin splitting. We also find that the magnetic field gradient produced by the vortex is sufficient to address spins separated by nanometre-length scales. By applying a microwave-frequency magnetic field, we drive both the vortex and the nitrogen-vacancy spins, resulting in enhanced coherent rotation of the spin state. Finally, we demonstrate that by driving the vortex on fast timescales, sequential addressing and coherent manipulation of spins is possible on ∼100 ns timescales. Nitrogen vacancies in diamond present single spin defects which may be used as nanoscale magnetic sensors. Here, Wolf et al.demonstrate how a ferromagnetic vortex in an adjacent micromagnet allows for fast nanoscale addressability of individual defect spins in nanodiamonds.},

   abstract = {Magnetometry and magnetic imaging with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defects in diamond rely on the optical detection of electron spin resonance (ESR). However, this technique is inherently limited to magnetic fields that are weak enough to avoid electron spin mixing. Here, we focus on the high off-axis magnetic field regime where spin mixing alters the NV defect spin dynamics. We first study, in a quantitative manner, the dependence of the NV defect optical properties on the magnetic field vector B. Magnetic-field-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence (PL) measurements are compared to a seven-level model of the NV defect that accounts for field-induced spin mixing. The model reproduces decreases in (i) ESR contrast, (ii) PL intensity and (iii) excited level lifetime with an increasing off-axis magnetic field. We next demonstrate that these effects can be used to perform all-optical imaging of the magnetic field component |B⊥| orthogonal on the NV defect axis. Using a scanning NV defect microscope, we map the stray field of a magnetic hard disc through both PL and fluorescence lifetime imaging. This all-optical method for high magnetic field imaging at the nanoscale might be of interest in the field of nanomagnetism, where samples producing fields in excess of several tens of milliteslas are typically found. © IOP Publishing Ltd and Deutsche Physikalische Gesellschaft.},

   abstract = {High biocompatibility, variable size ranging from ≈5 nm, stable luminescence from its color centers, and simple carbon chemistry for biomolecule grafting make nanodiamond (ND) particles an attractive alternative to molecular dyes for drug-delivery. A novel method is presented that can be used for remote monitoring of chemical processes in biological environments based on color changes from photoluminescent (PL) nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in ND. The NV luminescence is driven chemically by alternating the surface chemical potential by interacting atoms and molecules with the diamond surface. Due to the small ND size, the changes of the surface chemical potential modify the electric field profile at the diamond surfaces (i.e., band bending) and intermingle with the electronic NV states. This leads to changes in NV -/NV°PL ratio and allows construction of optical chemo-biosensors operating in cells, with PL visible in classical confocal microscopes. This phenomenon is demonstrated on single crystal diamond containing engineered NV centers and on oxidized and hydrogenated ND in liquid physiological buffers for variously sized ND particles. Hydrogenation of NDs leads to quenching of luminescence related to negatively charged (NV -) centers and as a result produces color shifts from NV - (638 nm) to neutral NV°(575 nm) luminescence. How the reduction of diamond size increases the magnitude of the NV color shift phenomena is modeled. The luminescence of nanodiamond (ND) originates from nitrogen-vacancy (NV) color centers that can emit luminescence in two spectral regions, either from 570 to 620 nm or from 630 to 750 nm. Chemically induced surface changes enable switching between the two luminescence channels. The hole accumulation layer developed at the nanodiamond surface by hydrogen termination leads to quenching of the NV luminescence. Copyright © 2012 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, Weinheim.},

While the synthesis and compositional control of NWs have seen major improvements, considerable challenges remain for the characterization of local magnetic features at the nanoscale. Here, we demonstrate nonperturbative field distribution mapping in ultrascaled magnetic nanowires with diameters down to 6 nm by scanning nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry. This enables localized, minimally invasive magnetic imaging with sensitivity down to 3 μT Hz–1/2. The imaging reveals the presence of weak magnetic inhomogeneities inside in-plane magnetized nanowires that are largely undetectable with standard metrology and can be related to local fluctuations of the NWs’ saturation magnetization. In addition, the strong magnetic field confinement in the nanowires allows for the study of the interaction between the stray magnetic field and the nitrogen-vacancy sensor, thus clarifying the contrasting formation mechanisms for technologically relevant magnetic nanostructures.},

We realize this approach using a dense layer of electronic sensor spins in a diamond chip, which combines the ability to detect small magnetic fields with a sensitivity to their polarization. Focusing on a thin-film magnetic insulator, we quantify spin-wave amplitudes, visualize spin-wave dispersion and interference, and demonstrate time-domain measurements of spin-wave packets. We theoretically explain the observed anisotropic spin-wave patterns in terms of chiral spin-wave excitation and stray-field coupling to the sensor spins.

   abstract = {In recent years, artificial neural networks have become the flagship algorithm of artificial intelligence1. In these systems, neuron activation functions are static, and computing is achieved through standard arithmetic operations. By contrast, a prominent branch of neuroinspired computing embraces the dynamical nature of the brain and proposes to endow each component of a neural network with dynamical functionality, such as oscillations, and to rely on emergent physical phenomena, such as synchronization2–6, for solving complex problems with small networks7–11. This approach is especially interesting for hardware implementations, because emerging nanoelectronic devices can provide compact and energy-efficient nonlinear auto-oscillators that mimic the periodic spiking activity of biological neurons12–16. The dynamical couplings between oscillators can then be used to mediate the synaptic communication between the artificial neurons. One challenge for using nanodevices in this way is to achieve learning, which requires fine control and tuning of their coupled oscillations17; the dynamical features of nanodevices can be difficult to control and prone to noise and variability18. Here we show that the outstanding tunability of spintronic nano-oscillators—that is, the possibility of accurately controlling their frequency across a wide range, through electrical current and magnetic field—can be used to address this challenge. We successfully train a hardware network of four spin-torque nano-oscillators to recognize spoken vowels by tuning their frequencies according to an automatic real-time learning rule. We show that the high experimental recognition rates stem from the ability of these oscillators to synchronize. Our results demonstrate that non-trivial pattern classification tasks can be achieved with small hardware neural networks by endowing them with nonlinear dynamical features such as oscillations and synchronization. A network of four spin-torque nano-oscillators can be trained in real time to recognize spoken vowels, in a simple and scalable approach that could be exploited for large-scale neural networks.},

   abstract = {The nitrogen-vacancy defect centre in diamond1,2,3,4 has potential applications in nanoscale electric and magnetic-field sensing2,3,4,5,6, single-photon microscopy7,8, quantum information processing9 and bioimaging10. These applications rely on the ability to position a single nitrogen-vacancy centre within a few nanometres of a sample, and then scan it across the sample surface, while preserving the centre's spin coherence and readout fidelity. However, existing scanning techniques, which use a single diamond nanocrystal grafted onto the tip of a scanning probe microscope2,8,11,12, suffer from short spin coherence times due to poor crystal quality, and from inefficient far-field collection of the fluorescence from the nitrogen-vacancy centre. Here, we demonstrate a robust method for scanning a single nitrogen-vacancy centre within tens of nanometres from a sample surface that addresses both of these concerns. This is achieved by positioning a single nitrogen-vacancy centre at the end of a high-purity diamond nanopillar, which we use as the tip of an atomic force microscope. Our approach ensures long nitrogen-vacancy spin coherence times (∼75&nbsp;µs), enhanced nitrogen-vacancy collection efficiencies due to waveguiding, and mechanical robustness of the device (several weeks of scanning time). We are able to image magnetic domains with widths of 25&nbsp;nm, and demonstrate a magnetic field sensitivity of 56&nbsp;nT Hz–1/2 at a frequency of 33&nbsp;kHz, which is unprecedented for scanning nitrogen-vacancy centres. Magnetic fields are imaged with nanoscale resolution and high sensitivity using nitrogen-vacancy centres embedded in high-purity diamond nanopillars.},

Typically, relaxation rates are estimated with curve-fitting techniques that do not provide optimal sensitivity, often leading to long acquisition times that are particularly detrimental in systems prone to drift or other dynamics of interest. Here we show that adaptive Bayesian estimation is well suited to this problem, producing dynamic relaxometry pulse sequences that rapidly find an optimal operating regime. In many situations (including the system we employ), this approach can speed the acquisition by an order of magnitude. We also present a four-signal measurement protocol that is robust to drifts in spin readout contrast, polarization, and microwave pulse fidelity while still achieving near-optimal sensitivity. The combined technique offers a practical, hardware-agnostic approach for a wide range of N-V relaxometry applications.},

We image both the coherent spin waves and the resulting incoherent magnon gas using scanning-probe magnetometry based on electron spins in diamond. We find that the gas extends unidirectionally over hundreds of micrometers from the excitation stripline. Surprisingly, the gas density far exceeds that expected for a boson system following a Bose-Einstein distribution with a maximum value of the chemical potential. We characterize the momentum distribution of the gas by measuring the nanoscale spatial decay of the magnetic stray fields.

The experimental results are in good agreement with a simplified model of the NV defect spin dynamics, leading to an optimized sensitivity around 2μT/√Hz for a single NV defect in a high-purity diamond crystal grown by chemical vapor deposition. We then demonstrate an enhancement of the magnetic sensitivity by one order of magnitude by using a simple pulsed-ESR scheme. This technique is based on repetitive excitation of the NV defect with a resonant microwave π pulse followed by an optimized readout laser pulse, allowing to fully eliminate power broadening of the ESR linewidth.

   abstract = {A microscopic (or Hamiltonian-based) theory is employed for the spin-wave instability thresholds of nonlinear processes in ultrathin ferromagnetic stripes and films under perpendicular pumping with an intense microwave field. The spatially-quantized linear spin waves in these nanostructures may participate in parametric processes through the three-magnon interactions (the first-order Suhl process) and the four-magnon interactions (the second-order Suhl process) when pumped. By contrast with most previous studies of spin-wave instabilities made for larger samples, where macroscopic (or continuum) theories involving Maxwell's equations for magnetic dipolar effects are used, a discrete lattice of effective spins is employed. Then a dipole-exchange spin Hamiltonian is employed to investigate the behavior of the quantized spin waves under perpendicular pumping, when modifications due to the more extensive spatial confinement and edges effects in these nanostructures become pronounced. The instability thresholds versus applied magnetic field are calculated, with emphasis on the size effects and geometries of the nanostructures and on the different relative strengths of the magnetic dipole-dipole and exchange interactions in materials. Numerical results are presented using parameters for Permalloy, YIG, and EuS.},

However, a central question remains unresolved: what type of magnetic motions can be generated by this torque?

The nature of the possible motions has not been determined. Here we demonstrate a technique that allows direct electrical measurements of microwave-frequency dynamics in individual nanomagnets, propelled by a d.c. spin-polarized current. We show that spin transfer can produce several different types of magnetic excitation. Although there is no mechanical motion, a simple magnetic-multilayer structure acts like a nanoscale motor; it converts energy from a d.c. electrical current into high-frequency magnetic rotations that might be applied in new devices including microwave sources and resonators.},

elegant mechanism for propagation losses compensation. While partial
compensation of the spin-wave damping has allowed for spin-wave signal

the operating conditions to achieve unambiguous amplification using clocked
nanoseconds -long spin-orbit torque pulses in sub-micrometer wide magnonic
waveguides, where the effective magnetization has been engineered to be close
to zero to suppress the detrimental magnon-magnon scattering. As a result, we
achieve an exponential increase in the intensity of propagating spin waves up

   abstract = {Spin torque from spin current applied to a nanoscale region of a ferromagnet can act as negative magnetic damping and thereby excite self-oscillations of its magnetization. In contrast, spin torque uniformly applied to the magnetization of an extended ferromagnetic film does not generate self-oscillatory magnetic dynamics but leads to reduction of the saturation magnetization. Here we report studies of the effect of spin torque on a system of intermediate dimensionality—a ferromagnetic nanowire. We observe coherent self-oscillations of magnetization in a ferromagnetic nanowire serving as the active region of a spin torque oscillator driven by spin orbit torques. Our work demonstrates that magnetization self-oscillations can be excited in a one-dimensional magnetic system and that dimensions of the active region of spin torque oscillators can be extended beyond the nanometre length scale. In ferromagnetic thin films, spin torque applied to nanometre-scale areas excites localized magnetic self-oscillations, or reduces net magnetization if applied uniformly. Here, Duan et al.show how 1D geometrical confinement allows for coherent self-oscillations to be excited over extended length scales.},

   abstract = {This review is devoted to both the experimental and theoretical aspects of lateral confinement effects observed for spin waves, with the wavevector in the 102-106cm-1 range, where the magnetic dipole interaction plays the most important role. The Brillouin light scattering (BLS) technique is a powerful tool for the investigation of these effects. In addition to a high sensitivity, which is characteristic for a standard BLS system, we have extended the method to achieve high lateral spatial (30-50μm), as well as temporal (1-2ns) resolution. This is central for the studies summarized in the review. Two representative experimental situations are reviewed: (1) Spin wave confinement in micron size laterally pattered structures (regular arrays of magnetic dots and wires). We focus on the quantization of spin wave wavevectors due to the lateral boundaries of a dot or a wire, and the influence of the static and dynamic coupling between islands. (2) Spatial, temporal and spatio-temporal confinement of linear and nonlinear spin waves in magnetic ferrite films. The formation, propagation, and collision of envelope solitons and their two-dimensional analogs (spin wave bullets) are analyzed. Both analytical and numerical models for spin waves in quasi-one-dimensional waveguides and in wide films are discussed. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

   abstract = {Early experiments in magnonics were made using ferrite samples, largely due to the intrinsically low magnetic (spin-wave) damping in these materials. Historically, magnonic phenomena were studied on micrometre to millimetre length scales. Today, the principal challenge in applied magnonics is to create sub-micrometre devices using modern polycrystalline magnetic alloys. However, until certain technical obstacles are overcome in these materials, ferrites-in particular yttrium iron garnet (YIG)-remain a valuable source of insight. At a time when interest in magnonic systems is particularly strong, it is both useful and timely to review the main scientific results of YIG magnonics of the last two decades, and to discuss the transferability of the concepts and ideas learned in ferrite materials to modern nano-scale systems. © 2010 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Smith2020,
   abstract = {Auto-oscillations of magnetization driven by direct spin current have been previously observed in multiple quasi-zero-dimensional (0D) ferromagnetic systems such as nanomagnets and nanocontacts. Recently, it was shown that pure spin Hall current can excite coherent auto-oscillatory dynamics in quasi-one-dimensional (1D) ferromagnetic nanowires but not in quasi-two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetic films. Here we study the 1D to 2D dimensional crossover of current-driven magnetization dynamics in wire-based Pt/Ni80Fe20 bilayer spin Hall oscillators via varying the wire width. We find that increasing the wire width results in an increase of the number of excited auto-oscillatory modes accompanied by a decrease of the amplitude and coherence of each mode. We also observe a crossover from a hard to a soft onset of the auto-oscillations with increasing wire width. The amplitude of auto-oscillations rapidly decreases with increasing temperature suggesting that interactions of the phase-coherent auto-oscillatory modes with incoherent thermal magnons play an important role in suppression of the auto-oscillatory dynamics. Our measurements set the upper limit on the dimensions of an individual spin Hall oscillator and elucidate the mechanisms leading to suppression of coherent auto-oscillations with increasing oscillator size.},

   abstract = {An attractive direction in next-generation information processing is the development of systems employing particles or quasiparticles other than electrons—ideally with low dissipation—as information carriers. One such candidate is the magnon: the quasiparticle associated with the eigen-excitations of magnetic materials known as spin waves. The realization of single-chip all-magnon information systems demands the development of circuits in which magnon currents can be manipulated by magnons themselves. Using a magnonic crystal—an artificial magnetic material—to enhance nonlinear magnon–magnon interactions, we have succeeded in the realization of magnon-by-magnon control, and the development of a magnon transistor. We present a proof of concept three-terminal device fabricated from an electrically insulating magnetic material. We demonstrate that the density of magnons flowing from the transistor’s source to its drain can be decreased three orders of magnitude by the injection of magnons into the transistor’s gate. A disturbance in the local magnetic order can propagate across a material just like a wave. Chumak et al.now demonstrate a transistor operating on a single quantum of these so-called spin waves, known as a magnon, which could be a central element for magnetic-material-based information processing.},

   abstract = {State-of-the-art methods for sensing weak AC fields are only efficient in the low frequency domain (&lt;10 MHz). The inefficiency of sensing high-frequency signals is due to the lack of ability to use dynamical decoupling. In this paper we show that dynamical decoupling can be incorporated into high-frequency sensing schemes and by this we demonstrate that the high sensitivity achieved for low frequency can be extended to the whole spectrum. While our scheme is general and suitable to a variety of atomic and solid-state systems, we experimentally demonstrate it with the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond. For a diamond with natural abundance of 13C, we achieve coherence times up to 1.43 ms resulting in a smallest detectable magnetic field strength of 4 nT at 1.6 GHz. Attributed to the inherent nature of our scheme, we observe an additional increase in coherence time due to the signal itself. State-of-the-art methods for sensing weak AC fields are only efficient in the low frequency domain. Here, Stark et al. demonstrate a sensing scheme that is capable of probing high frequencies through continuous dynamical coupling by applying it to a nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond.},

   abstract = {A sufficiently fine ferromagnetic particle has a uniform vector magnetization whose magnitude is essentially constant, but whose direction fluctuates because of thermal agitation. The fluctuations are important in superparamagnetism and in magnetic aftereffect. The problem is approached here by methods familiar in the theory of stochastic processes. The "Langevin equation" of the problem is assumed to be Gilbert's equation of motion augmented by a "random-field" term. Consideration of a statistical ensemble of such particles leads to a "Fokker-Planck" partial differential equation, which describes the evolution of the probability density of orientations. The random-field concept, though convenient, can be avoided by use of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. The Fokker-Planck equation, in general, is complicated by the presence of gyroscopic terms. These drop out in the case of axial symmetry: then the problem of finding nonequilibrium solutions can be restated as a minimization problem, susceptible to approximate treatments. The case of energy barriers large in comparison with kT is treated both by approximate minimization and by an adaptation of Kramers' treatment of the escape of particles over barriers. The limits of validity of the discrete-orientation approximation are discussed. © 1963 The American Physical Society.},
