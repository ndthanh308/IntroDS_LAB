  "abstract": "This paper studies the behavior of solitons in the Korteweg-de Vries equation under the influence of multiplicative noise. We introduce stochastic processes that track the amplitude and position of solitons based on a rescaled frame formulation and stability properties of the soliton family. We furthermore construct tractable approximations to the stochastic soliton amplitude and position which reveal their leading-order drift. We find that the statistical properties predicted by our method agree well with numerical evidence.",
