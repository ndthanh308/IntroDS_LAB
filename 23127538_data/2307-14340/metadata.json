  "abstract": "In the paper, we study the non-Hermitian system under dissipation and give the effective 2*2 Hamiltonian in the k-space by reducing the N*N Hamiltonian in the real space for them. It is discovered that the energy band shows an imaginary line gap. To describe these phenomena, we propose the theory of \"non-Hermitian tearing\", in which the tearability we define reveals a continuous phase transition at the exceptional point. The non-Hermitian tearing manifests in two forms -- separation of bulk state and decoupling of boundary state. In addition, we also explore the one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model and the Qi-Wu-Zhang model under dissipation using the theory of non-Hermitian tearing. Our results provide a theoretical approach for exploring the controlling of non-Hermitian physics on topological quantum states.",
