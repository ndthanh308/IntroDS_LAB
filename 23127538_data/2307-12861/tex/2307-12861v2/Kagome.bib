abstract={The newly discovered kagome superconductors represent a promising platform for investigating the interplay between band topology, electronic order and lattice geometry1--9. Despite extensive research efforts on this system, the nature of the superconducting ground state remains elusive10--17. In particular, consensus on the electron pairing symmetry has not been achieved so far18--20, in part owing to the lack of a momentum-resolved measurement of the superconducting gap structure. Here we report the direct observation of a nodeless, nearly isotropic and orbital-independent superconducting gap in the momentum space of two exemplary CsV3Sb5-derived kagome superconductors---Cs(V0.93Nb0.07)3Sb5 and Cs(V0.86Ta0.14)3Sb5---using ultrahigh-resolution and low-temperature angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Remarkably, such a gap structure is robust to the appearance or absence of charge order in the normal state, tuned by isovalent Nb/Ta substitutions of V. Our comprehensive characterizations of the superconducting gap provide indispensable information on the electron pairing symmetry of kagome superconductors, and advance our understanding of the superconductivity and intertwined electronic orders in quantum materials.},

	journal = {New Journal of Physics},
	abstract = {In underdoped high-Tc cuprates, d-wave superconductivity competes with antiferromagnetism. It has generally been accepted that suppressing superconductivity leads to the nucleation of spin-density wave (SDW) order with wavevector near (π, π). We show theoretically, for a d-wave superconductor in an applied magnetic field including disorder and electronic correlations, that the creation of SDW order is in fact not simply due to suppression of superconductivity, but rather due to a correlation-induced splitting of an electronic bound state arising from the sign change of the order parameter along quasiparticle trajectories. The induced SDW order is therefore a direct consequence of the d-wave symmetry. The formation of anti-phase domain walls proves to be crucial for explaining the heretofore puzzling temperature dependence of the induced magnetism as measured by neutron diffraction.}

abstract={In crystalline materials, electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is a ubiquitous many-body interaction that drives conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer superconductivity. Recently, in a new kagome metal CsV3Sb5, superconductivity that possibly intertwines with time-reversal and spatial symmetry-breaking orders is observed. Density functional theory calculations predicted weak EPC strength, $\lambda$, supporting an unconventional pairing mechanism in CsV3Sb5. However, experimental determination of $\lambda$ is still missing, hindering a microscopic understanding of the intertwined ground state of CsV3Sb5. Here, using 7-eV laser-based angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and Eliashberg function analysis, we determine an intermediate $\lambda$=0.45--0.6 at T{\thinspace}={\thinspace}6{\thinspace}K for both Sb 5p and V 3d electronic bands, which can support a conventional superconducting transition temperature on the same magnitude of experimental value in CsV3Sb5. Remarkably, the EPC on the V 3d-band enhances to $\lambda${\textasciitilde}0.75 as the superconducting transition temperature elevated to 4.4{\thinspace}K in Cs(V0.93Nb0.07)3Sb5. Our results provide an important clue to understand the pairing mechanism in the kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5.},

abstract={Superconductivity and superfluidity with anisotropic pairing---such as d-wave in cuprates and p-wave in superfluid 3He---are strongly suppressed by impurities. Meanwhile, for applications, the robustness of Cooper pairs to disorder is highly desired. Recently, it has been suggested that unconventional systems become robust if the impurity scattering mixes quasiparticle states only within individual subsystems obeying the Anderson theorem that protects conventional superconductivity. Here, we experimentally verify this conjecture by measuring the temperature dependence of the energy gap in the polar phase of superfluid 3He. We show that oriented columnar non-magnetic defects do not essentially modify the energy spectrum, which has a Dirac nodal line. Although the scattering is strong, it preserves the momentum along the length of the columns and forms robust subsystems according to the conjecture. This finding may stimulate future experiments on the protection of topological superconductivity against disorder and on the nature of topological fermionic flat bands.},

abstract = {Cooper pairs in unconventional superconductors having extra internal degrees of freedom are protected in an unexpected way. A well-known result in unconventional superconductivity is the fragility of nodal superconductors against nonmagnetic impurities. Despite this common wisdom, Bi2Se3-based topological superconductors have recently displayed unusual robustness against disorder. Here, we provide a theoretical framework that naturally explains what protects Cooper pairs from strong scattering in complex superconductors. Our analysis is based on the concept of superconducting fitness and generalizes the famous Anderson’s theorem into superconductors having multiple internal degrees of freedom with simple assumptions such as the Born approximation. For concreteness, we report on the extreme example of the Cux(PbSe)5(BiSe3)6 superconductor. Thermal conductivity measurements down to 50 mK not only give unambiguous evidence for the existence of nodes but also reveal that the energy scale corresponding to the scattering rate is orders of magnitude larger than the superconducting energy gap. This provides the most spectacular case of the generalized Anderson’s theorem protecting a nodal superconductor.}}

month={May},

volume={3},

abstract={Kagome lattices offer a fertile ground to explore exotic quantum phenomena associated with electron correlation and band topology. The recent discovery of superconductivity coexisting with charge-density wave (CDW) in the kagome metals KV3Sb5, RbV3Sb5, and CsV3Sb5 suggests an intriguing entanglement of electronic order and superconductivity. However, the microscopic origin of CDW, a key to understanding the superconducting mechanism and its possible topological nature, remains elusive. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy of KV3Sb5 and demonstrate a substantial reconstruction of Fermi surface in the CDW state that accompanies the formation of small three-dimensional pockets. The CDW gap exhibits a periodicity of undistorted Brillouin zone along the out-of-plane wave vector, signifying a dominant role of the in-plane inter-saddle-point scattering to the mechanism of CDW. The characteristics of experimental band dispersion can be captured by first-principles calculations with the inverse star-of-David structural distortion. The present result indicates a direct link between the low-energy excitations and CDW, and puts constraints on the microscopic theory of superconductivity in alkali-metal kagome lattices.},

abstract = {A B.C.S. type of theory (see Bardeen, Cooper and Schreiffer, Phys. Rev.108, 1175 (1957)) is sketched for very dirty superconductors, where elastic scattering from physical and chemical impurities is large compared with the energy gap. This theory is based on pairing each one-electron state with its exact time reverse, a generalization of the k up, −k down pairing of the B.C.S. theory which is independent of such scattering. Such a theory has many qualitative and a few quantitative points of agreement with experiment, in particular with specific-heat data, energy-gap measurements, and transition-temperature versus impurity curves. Other types of pairing which have been suggested are not compatible with the existence of dirty superconductors.}
