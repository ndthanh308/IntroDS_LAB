\section{Motivation}
The shape and structure of molecules play a crucial role in determining their interactions with other molecules, as complementary geometric shapes are required for successful binding \cite{fischer1894einfluss}. To accurately predict molecular interactions, it is essential to incorporate geometric information such as 3D coordinates and spectral descriptors. Our approach to predicting molecular interactions integrates this geometric information into the representation of proteins as graph residues, resulting in a more enhanced and accurate representation.Furthermore, we recognize the importance of the outer surface of a molecule in molecular interactions. To address this, we focus on computations performed on the outer surface of the molecule and then map these predictions to the corresponding residues. By considering the surface of the molecule, we gain valuable insights into the molecular interactions occurring on the surface and enable the use of geometric deep-learning models to analyze these interactions. This approach can potentially provide significant benefits over traditional methods, ultimately leading to more accurate and efficient predictions of molecular interactions.
