  "abstract": "An effective field theory framework is used to investigate some Lorentz-violating effects on the generation of electromagnetic and gravitational waves, complementing previous work on propagation. Specifically we find solutions to a modified, anisotropic wave equation, sourced by charge or fluid matter. We derive the radiation fields for scalars, classical electromagnetic radiation, and partial results for gravitational radiation. For gravitational waves, the results show longitudinal and breathing polarizations proportional to coefficients for spacetime-symmetry breaking.",
