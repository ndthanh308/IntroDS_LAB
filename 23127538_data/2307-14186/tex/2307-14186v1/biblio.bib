abstract = {We present a graph-theoretic model for the frequency assignment problem in cellular phone networks. Obeying several technical and legal restrictions, frequencies have to be assigned to transceivers so that interference is as small as possible. This optimization problem is NP-hard. Good approximation cannot be guaranteed unless P = NP. We describe several assignment heuristics. These heuristics are simple and not too hard to implement. We give an assessment of the heuristics' efficiency and practical usefulness. For this purpose, typical instances of frequency assignment problems with up to 4240 transceivers and 75 frequencies of a German cellular phone network operator are used. The results are satisfying from a practitioner's point of view. The best performing heuristics were integrated into a network planning system used in practice.}

@article{EGK2002,
abstract = {This paper surveys frequency assignment problems coming up in planning wireless communication services. It particularly focuses on cellular mobile phone systems such as GSM, a technology that revolutionizes communication. Traditional vertex coloring provides a conceptual framework for the mathematical modeling of many frequency planning problems. This basic form, however, needs various extensions to cover technical and organizational side constraints. Among these ramifications are T-coloring and list coloring. To model all the subtleties, the techniques of integer programming have proven to be very useful.The ability to produce good frequency plans in practice is essential for the quality of mobile phone networks. The present algorithmic solution methods employ variants of some of the traditional coloring heuristics as well as more sophisticated machinery from mathematical programming. This paper will also address this issue.Finally, this paper discusses several practical frequency assignment problems in detail, states the associated mathematical models, and also points to public electronic libraries of frequency assignment problems from practice. The associated graphs have up to several thousand vertices and range form rather sparse to almost complete.},

abstract = {We consider several semidefinite programming relaxations for the max-k-cut problem, with increasing complexity. The optimal solution of the weakest presented semidefinite programming relaxation has a closed form expression that includes the largest Laplacian eigenvalue of the graph under consideration. This is the first known eigenvalue bound for the max-k-cut when k>2 that is applicable to any graph. This bound is exploited to derive a new eigenvalue bound on the chromatic number of a graph. For regular graphs, the new bound on the chromatic number is the same as the well-known Hoffman bound; however, the two bounds are incomparable in general. We prove that the eigenvalue bound for the max-k-cut is tight for several classes of graphs. We investigate the presented bounds for specific classes of graphs, such as walk-regular graphs, strongly regular graphs, and graphs from the Hamming association scheme.}

If a string is in the language, then there exists a proof such that the verifier accepts with probability 1 (i.e., for every choice of its random string). For strings not in the language, the verifier rejects every provided “proof” with probability at least 1/2. Our result builds upon and improves a recent result of Arora and Safra [1998] whose verifiers examine a nonconstant number of bits in the proof (though this number is a very slowly growing function of the input length).As a consequence, we prove that no MAX SNP-hard problem has a polynomial time approximation scheme, unless NP = P. The class MAX SNP was defined by Papadimitriou and Yannakakis [1991] and hard problems for this class include vertex cover, maximum satisfiability, maximum cut, metric TSP, Steiner trees and shortest superstring. We also improve upon the clique hardness results of Feige et al. [1996] and Arora and Safra [1998] and show that there exists a positive ε such that approximating the maximum clique size in an N-vertex graph to within a factor of Nε is NP-hard.},

abstract = {We study the Max k-Cut problem and its dual, the Min k-Partition problem. In the Min k-Partition problem, given a graph G=(V,E) and positive edge weights, we want to find an edge set of minimum weight whose removal makes G k-colorable. For the Max k-Cut problem we show that, if P!=NP, no polynomial time approximation algorithm can achieve a relative error better than (1/34)k. It is well known that a relative error of 1/k is obtained by a naive randomized heuristic. For the Min k-Partition problem, we show that for k<2 and for every epsilon<0, there exists a constant alpha such that the problem cannot be approximated within alpha|V^(2-epsilon)|, even for dense graphs. Both problems are directly related to the frequency allocation problem for cellular (mobile) telephones, an application of industrial relevance.}

We use a cutting-plane algorithm that relies on the early termination of an interior point method, and we study the performance of SDP and linear programming (LP) relaxations for various values of k and instance types. The LP relaxation is strengthened using combinatorial facet-defining inequalities and SDP-based constraints. Our computational results suggest that the LP approach, especially with the addition of SDP-based constraints, outperforms the SDP relaxations for graphs with positive-weight edges and k≥7.}

First we show the completeness of Simple Max Cut (Max Cut with edge weights restricted to value 1), and, as a corollary, the completeness of the Optimal Linear Arrangement problem. We then show that even if the domains of the Node Cover and Directed Hamiltonian Path problems are restricted to planar graphs, the two problems remain NP-complete, and that these and other graph problems remain NP-complete even when their domains are restricted to graphs with low node degrees. For Graph 3-Colorability, Node Cover, and Undirected Hamiltonian Circuit, we determine essentially the lowest possible upper bounds on node degree for which the problems remain NP-complete.}

We also obtain a quasi-PTAS for Balanced k-Median in metrics with constant doubling dimension. As in the work of Bartal et al., our approximation for general metrics uses embeddings into tree metrics. The main technical contribution in this paper is an O(1)-approximation for Balanced k-Median in hierarchically separated trees (HSTs). Our improvement comes from a more direct dynamic programming approach that heavily exploits the properties of standard HSTs. In this way, we avoid the reduction to special types of HSTs that were considered by Bartal et al., thereby avoiding an additional $$O(epsilon ^{-1} log ^epsilon n)$$O(∈-1log∈n) loss.},

abstract = {The min-sum k-clustering problem is to partition a metric space (P, d) into k clusters C1, . . . , Ck ⊆ P such that Σi=1k Σ p,q∈Ci d(p,q) is minimized. We show the first efficient construction of a coreset for this problem. Our coreset construction is based on a new adaptive sampling algorithm. Using our coresets we obtain three main algorithmic results.The first result is a sublinear time (4+undefined)-approximation algorithm for the min-sum k-clustering problem in metric spaces. The running time of this algorithm is \~{O}(n) for any constant k and undefined, and it is o(n2) for all k = o(log n/ log log n). Since the description size of the input is Θ(n2), this is sublinear in the input size.Our second result is the first pass-efficient data streaming algorithm for min-sum k-clustering in the distance oracle model, i.e., an algorithm that uses poly(log n, k) space and makes 2 passes over the input point set arriving as a data stream.Our third result is a sublinear-time polylogarithmic-factor approximation algorithm for the min-sum k-clustering problem for arbitrary values of k.To develop the coresets, we introduce the concept of a-preserving metric embeddings. Such an embedding satisfies properties that (a) the distance between any pair of points does not decrease, and (b) the cost of an optimal solution for the considered problem on input (P, d′) is within a constant factor of the optimal solution on input (P, d). In other words, the idea is find a metric embedding into a (structurally simpler) metric space that approximates the original metric up to a factor of a with respect to a certain problem. We believe that this concept is an interesting generalization of coresets.},

abstract = { Consider the multicommodity flow problem in which the object is to maximize the sum of commodities routed. We prove the following approximate max-flow min-multicut theorem: \[ \frac{{\min {\text{multicut}}}}{{O(\log k)}} \leqslant \max {\text{flow}} \leqslant \min {\text{multicut}}, \] where k is the number of commodities. Our proof is constructive; it enables us to find a multicut within \$O(\log k)\$ of the max flow (and hence also the optimal multicut). In addition, the proof technique provides a unified framework in which one can also analyse the case of flows with specified demands of Leighton and Rao and Klein et al. and thereby obtain an improved bound for the latter problem. }

abstract = {Since the first cellular networks were trialled in the 1970s, we have witnessed an incredible wireless revolution. From 1G to 4G, the massive traffic growth has been managed by a combination of wider bandwidths, refined radio interfaces, and network densification, namely increasing the number of antennas per site. Due its cost-efficiency, the latter has contributed the most. Massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) is a key 5G technology that uses massive antenna arrays to provide a very high beamforming gain and spatially multiplexing of users and hence increases the spectral and energy efficiency (see references herein). It constitutes a centralized solution to densify a network, and its performance is limited by the inter-cell interference inherent in its cell-centric design. Conversely, ubiquitous cell-free Massive MIMO refers to a distributed Massive MIMO system implementing coherent user-centric transmission to overcome the inter-cell interference limitation in cellular networks and provide additional macro-diversity. These features, combined with the system scalability inherent in the Massive MIMO design, distinguish ubiquitous cell-free Massive MIMO from prior coordinated distributed wireless systems. In this article, we investigate the enormous potential of this promising technology while addressing practical deployment issues to deal with the increased back/front-hauling overhead deriving from the signal co-processing.},

abstract = {Energy efficiency is a key requirement for future network design, and user-centric (UC) cell-free (CF) massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) networks can achieve over ten times the energy efficiency. Based on this, this paper studies a CF MIMO simultaneous wireless information and power transmission system and proposes a UC access point (AP) selection method and a trade-off performance optimization scheme for spectral efficiency and energy efficiency. In this system, users have both energy recovery and information transmission functions. According to the difference between the interference in the energy harvesting and information transmission process, a flexible AP selection scheme is designed. Blindly pursuing high spectral efficiency will result in waste of resources. This paper proposes an evaluation index that takes into account both energy efficiency and spectral efficiency, analyses the trade-off between energy efficiency and spectral efficiency, and jointly optimizes the AP selection scheme and the uplink (UL) and downlink (DL) time switching ratio to maximize the trade-off performance. Then, the non-convex problem is converted to a geometric planning problem to solve. The simulation results show that by implementing a suitable AP selection scheme and UL and DL time allocation, the information processing scheme on the AP side has a slight loss in spectral efficiency, but the energy efficiency is close to the performance of global processing on the central processing unit.},

abstract = {Focusing on the pilot contamination problem of cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO), a pilot allocation algorithm based on access point (AP) selection is proposed. To improve the system performance further, data power optimization is carried out. First, the AP that serves each user is selected through the user-centered idea and the large-scale fading matrix. Use the same service AP numbers between users to measure the pilot contamination intensity and then assign orthogonal pilots to strong potential pilot contamination users. A spectrum efficiency (SE) scheme to maximize the minimum user is proposed for the fairness problem in data power optimization. It is proved that the objective function of data power optimization accords with linear programming, and a dichotomy is given to solve the problem. Simulation results show that the pilot allocation algorithm based on AP selection can significantly improve the total SE of the system and reduce the computational complexity of the system. At the same time, the data power optimization algorithm improves minimum SE for users in the system.},

abstract = {The mobile data traffic has been exponentially growing during the last several decades. This was enabled by the densification of the network infrastructure in terms of increased cell density (i.e., Ultra-Dense Network (UDN)) and/or the increased number of active antennas per Access Point (AP) (i.e., massive Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (mMIMO)). However, neither UDN nor mMIMO will meet the increasing demand for the data rate of the Sixth Generation (6G) wireless communications due to the inter-cell interference and large quality-of-service variations. Cell-Free (CF) mMIMO, which combines the best aspects of UDN and mMIMO, is viewed as a key solution to this issue. In such systems, each User Equipment (UE) is served by a preferred set of surrounding APs cooperatively. In this paper, we provide a survey of the state-of-the-art literature on CF mMIMO. As a starting point, the significance and the basic properties of CF mMIMO are highlighted. We then present the canonical framework to discuss the essential details (i.e., transmission procedure and mathematical system model). Next, we provide a deep look at the resource allocation and signal processing problems related to CF mMIMO and survey the up-to-date schemes and algorithms. After that, we discuss the practical issues in implementing CF mMIMO and point out the potential future directions. Finally, we conclude this paper with a summary of the key lessons learned in this field.}
