  "abstract": "In this paper we consider the class of Lipschitz maps on the unit ball $B_X$ of a Banach space $X$, and the question we deal with is whether for any $λ>1$ there exists a $λ$-Lipschitz fixed-point free mapping $T\\colon B_X\\to B_X$ with $\\mathrm{d}(T,B_X)=0$. We also consider its Hölder version. New related results are obtained. We show that if $X$ has a spreading Schauder basis then such mappings can always be built, answering a question posed by the first author in \\cite{Bar}. In the general case, using a recent approach of R. Medina \\cite{M} concerning Hölder retractions of $(r_n)$-flat closed convex sets, we show that for any decreasing null sequence $(r_n)\\subset \\mathbb{R}$ and $α\\in (0,1)$, there exists a fixed-point free mapping $T$ on $B_X$ so that $\\|T^nx - T^n y\\|\\leq r_n(\\| x - y\\|^α+1)$ for all $x, y\\in B_X$ and $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$.",
