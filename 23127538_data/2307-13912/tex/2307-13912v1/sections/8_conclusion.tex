\section{conclusion}

Our work embeds the social scientific construct of anti-democratic attitudes into a social media AI objective function. We demonstrate that the survey instruments from prior work on this construct can be adapted into prompts for a large language model (LLM), producing a \textit{democratic attitude model}. Through a series of three studies, we found that social media feeds that integrate this democratic attitude model can significantly reduce partisan animosity without compromising user engagement levels. This \textit{societal objective function} method presents a novel strategy for translating social science theory to algorithmic objectives, which opens up new possibilities to encode societal values in social media AIs.
