\section{Study 3: Replication Using The Democratic Attitude Model}
Closing the loop, we wished to test whether a feed using the automated democratic attitude model labels replicated the effect on partisan animosity that we observed in Study 1 with the manual labels. In Study 3, we conducted a pre-registered replication study ($N$ = 558) \footnote{A priori power analysis using G*Power determined that a total sample of at least 432 participants would be needed to achieve 80\% power if $\alpha$ = .05 and effect size $f$ = .10 were assumed to be the minimum effect size of interest.} among US partisans to compare the algorithmic downranking feed to a manual downranking feed and to a control feed ranked by engagement. Participants were recruited from CloudResearch Connect. Those who participated in Study 1 were ruled out from the study pool. The experimental procedure and measurements remained the same as Study 1.

\subsection{Experimental Design and Hypothesis}
In Study 3, we conducted a between-subjects study design online experiment with three conditions in June 2023. The \textit{manual} condition was the downranking feed from Study 1 that utilized manual expert labels. The \textit{algorithm} condition was a downranking feed using the output from the democratic attitude model using GPT-4 instead of manual labels. The \textit{engagement} control condition was identical to Study 1. We predicted that partisans exposed to the algorithmic feed would reduce partisan animosity compared to partisans in the engagement feed\footnote{We only wanted to replicate the effect on partisan animosity as we did not find a significant effect on support for undemocratic practices in our Study 1 (H2).}:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item[\textbf{H4:}] Partisans exposed to the (a) manual downranking and (b) algorithmic downranking feed on social media will reduce partisan animosity compared to partisans in the engagement feed.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Results}

A general linear model (GLM) was used to test the effects of different feeds and party affiliation on partisan animosity. \textbf{H4} was supported (Figure~\ref{fig:animositygpt}): the automated, GPT-4 based democratic attitude feed reduced partisan animosity without impacting time on the site. There was a significant main effect of condition, $F$(2,557) = 3.77, $p$ = .024, and a significant main effect of party, $F$(1,557) = 53.31, $p$ <.001, on  partisan animosity. There was no significant interaction effect between party and condition, $F$(2,557) = .52, $p$ = .60. 

Multiple pairwise comparisons using Bonferroni correction showed that partisans exposed to both the manual ($M$ = 68.96, $SD$ = 23.33) and the algorithmic ($M$ = 69.32, $SD$ = 22.59) downranked feeds displayed significantly lower partisan animosity compared to those exposed to the engagement feed ($M$ = 74.82, $SD$ = 19.73), manual vs. engagement: $p$ = .02, $d$ = -.27, algorithmic vs. engagement: $p$ = .036, $d$ = -.25. Same as in Study 1, there was no significant difference of time spent on the feed across conditions, $F$(1,557) = .26, $p$ = .77, \begin{math}\eta_{\text{p}}^{2}\end{math} = .001 (Manual: $M$ = 310.16, $SD$ = 256.96; GPT-4: $M$ = 326.16, $SD$ = 255.01; Engagement-based: $M$ = 318.47, $SD$ = 275.05), which indicates that both democratic attitude feeds did not compromise time spent on the feed.

\subsection{Summary}
In summary, Study 3 replicated the original result using algorithmic labeling rather than manual annotation. The effect size between the downranking feeds and the engagement feed on reducing partisan animosity (Manual vs. Engagement: $d$ = -.27; GPT-4 vs. Engagement: $d$ = -.25), is also identical to Study 1.
