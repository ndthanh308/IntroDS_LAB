  "abstract": "A quantum phase space version of the continuity equation for systems with internal degrees of freedom is derived. The $1$ -- D Dirac equation is introduced and its phase space counterpart is found.\n  The phase space representation of free motion and of scattering in a nonrelativistic and relativistic case for setups with internal degrees of freedom is discussed and illustrated.\n  Properties of Wigner functions of unbound states are analysed.",
