  "abstract": "In this work, the properties of the radiation emitted by a corner reflector with an electric dipole feeder are analyzed in the optical domain where the distance between the dipole and the corner apex can be large in terms of the optical wavelength. A comprehensive study of the fractal properties of the radiated intensity patterns is presented. The use of this setup for the realization of single-photon sources in photonic integrated circuits is also put forward and a detailed study of the emission properties of the device and its optimal configurations is presented.",
