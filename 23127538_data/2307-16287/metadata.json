  "abstract": "In this manuscript, we study the quantum-corrected Schwarzschild AdS black hole surrounded by quintessence matter in two folds: its thermal quantities and shadows. For this purpose, first, we present a detailed analysis of the influences of the quintessence matter field on Hawking temperature, mass, and specific heat functions. Then, we examine the shadows by following Carter's approach. We find that the shadow radius value takes smaller values for greater quintessence state parameter values. On the other hand, we see that the shadow radius takes greater values for greater values of the normalization parameter. Finally, in a brief section, we discuss the energy emission rate and show that the Gaussian-type plots' peak values are also affected by the quintessence matter field parameters.",
