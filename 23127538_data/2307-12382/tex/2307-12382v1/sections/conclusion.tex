\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec.conclusion}

We presented \name{} to help NLP experts to conduct a systematic and scalable analysis of the commonsense reasoning capabilities of language models.
It utilized an external commonsense knowledge base to contextualize and visualize 
% Based on an external commonsense knowledge base, \name{} contextualized and visualized 
the model behavior on different concepts and underlying relations from different levels of detail.
% At the global level, the system summarizes the model performance about different concepts and relations and helps users infer the overall relation learning. 
% At the subset level, the system visualizes the alignment between the model behavior with ConceptNet knowledge regarding question concepts, stems, and answers.
% And at the instance level, the system provides local explanations about individual instances and allows users to conduct counterfactual analysis of model behavior through instance manipulation.
Users can interactively probe and edit the model behavior to improve the model's reasoning abilities in specific knowledge areas.
The user study with cases showed the effectiveness of \name{} for diagnosing what commonsense knowledge a language model learns.
% The user study with cases demonstrated that \name{} could help experts comprehensively analyze what commonsense knowledge a language model learns.
% The three case studies and a user study demonstrated that \name{} could help experts gain deep insights into what commonsense knowledge a language model learns.

% In future work, we can improve the usability of \name{} by displaying prediction scores for answer choices in the \iv{} and enhancing our model editing methods for larger-scale editing. 
% % We also aim to conduct long-term studies on larger sets of relations and concepts using multiple language models and datasets to gain further insights into the system's effectiveness.
% % In the future, the system can be improved in several ways to enhance its usability.
% % For example, the system can show how the model ranks different answer choices in the \iv{} by displaying their prediction scores. 
% % Moreover, the system could improve model editing methods to support large-scale model editing. 
% % Moreover, the system can save users' exploration history of instances and allow users to update instances for model finetuning with algorithm support (\eg, data augmentation).
% % Furthermore, the system can be evaluated through long-term studies that examine the behavior of models on larger sets of relations and concepts using multiple language models and datasets. 
% % This can provide valuable insights into the effectiveness of the system.
