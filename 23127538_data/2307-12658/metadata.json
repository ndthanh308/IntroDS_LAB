  "abstract": "The key point to prove the optimal $C^{1,\\frac12}$ regularity of the thin obstacle problem is that the frequency at a point of the free boundary $x_0\\inΓ(u)$, say $N^{x_0}(0^+,u)$, satisfies the lower bound $N^{x_0}(0^+,u)\\ge\\frac32$.\n  In this paper we show an alternative method to prove this estimate, using an epiperimetric inequality for negative energies $W_\\frac32$. It allows to say that there are not $λ-$homogeneous global solutions with $λ\\in (1,\\frac32)$, and by this frequancy gap, we obtain the desired lower bound, thus a new self contained proof of the optimal regularity.",
