  "abstract": "In isolated nonlinear optical waveguide arrays with bounded energy spectrum, simultaneous conservation of energy and power of the optical modes enables study of coupled thermal and particle transport in the negative temperature regime. Here, based on exact numerical simulation and rationale from Landauer formalism, we predict generic violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law in such systems. This is rooted in the spectral decoupling of thermal and power current of optical modes, and their different temperature dependence. Our work extends the study of coupled thermal and particle transport into unprecedented regimes, not reachable in natural condensed matter and atomic gas systems.",
