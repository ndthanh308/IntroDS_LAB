%\section{Introduction}	
%W-F law:
%Semiconductor point contact\cite{van_thermo_1992}
Precisely-engineered optical systems have enabled study of problems originated from condensed matter and other branches of physics in clean and controllable setups\cite{Yablonovitch_1987,Sajeev_1987,Haldane_2008}. Recently, such effort has been extended from linear, Hermitian to nonlinear, non-Hermitian systems\cite{miri2019exceptional,el2018non,wright_physics_2022}. An important insight is description of the complex behavior of weakly nonlinear coupled optical waveguide arrays within the framework of statistical thermodynamics\cite{wu_thermodynamic_2019,parto_thermodynamic_2019,makris_statistical_2020}. It provides fresh new insight in understanding puzzling optical phenomena, such as beam self-cleaning \cite{krupa_spatial_2017,liu_kerr_2016,niang_spatial_2019}, 
spatiotemporal solitons\cite{herr_temporal_2014,wright_controllable_2015,kalashnikov_stabilization_2022},
mode-locking \cite{wright_spatiotemporal_2017},  
 and in designing novel devices to manipulate optical waves\cite{wu_thermodynamic_2019}, from the point of view of statistical mechanics
\cite{jung_thermal_2022,pyrialakos_thermalization_2022,shi_controlling_2021,leykam_probing_2021,bloch_non-equilibrium_2022,xiong_k-space_2022,baudin_classical_2020}.


When an isolated system initially deviates from equilibrium, it relaxes to equilibrium through thermal and particle transport mediated by nonlinear interactions within the system.
As a cornerstone result of linear irreversible thermodynamics\cite{callen1951irreversibility}, such coupled transport of thermal and particle current is characterized by the transport matrix. Its diagonal and off-diagonal elements correspond to particle ($G$), thermal ($G_T$) conductance (or conductivity) and thermo-particle (Seebeck and Peltier) transport coefficients, respectively. Study of these transport properties has gained invaluable information on the equilibrium and nonequilibrium properties of condensed matter and atomic gases\cite{brantut_thermoelectric_2013,nietner_transport_2014,gallego-marcos_nonequilibrium_2014,hausler_interaction-assisted_2021,2013arXiv1306.4018H,PhysRevLett.113.170601,rancon_bosonic_2014,uchino_bosonic_2020,husmann_connecting_2015,husmann_breakdown_2018}. The celebrated Wiedemann-Franz (W-F) law links the thermal and particle transport coefficients of the system, with the proportionality constant $L=G_T/(GT)$ being constant in Fermi liquids $L_0=k_B^2\pi^2/3$ with $k_B$ the Boltzmann constant. Break down of the W-F law indicates decoupling of thermal and particle transport\cite{lee_anomalously_2017,husmann_breakdown_2018}, whose origin ranges from strong inter-particle interaction to singular quasi-particle density of states. 


In this work, by numerically tracking the thermalization process of isolated transport junctions made from weakly nonlinear coupled waveguides within the microcanonical ensemble, we study the coupled power\footnote{It plays the role of particle number here. Thus, power conservation corresponds to particle number conservation.}  and thermal transport in such junctions. This is made possible due to simultaneous power and energy conservation. The same condition is difficult to realize in other bosonic systems like phonons or magnons, where there is no particle number conservation. We predict a generic violation of the W-F law in such junctions, with the Lorenz number $L \propto 1/T^2$ (Fig.~\ref{fig:1a}). It does not depend on details of the lattice structures, model parameters, 
 and is valid in both positive and negative temperature regimes. We provide a rationale of this result using the Landauer transport theory in the classical limit.
These results illustrate the opportunity to study fundamental problems of statistical thermodynamics in unprecedented regimes using engineered optical systems \cite{baldovin2021statistical,marques2023observation}. 
%The MOF system provides experimental opportunity to realize such temperature regimes and resolve the debate. 

%use temperature and chemical potential as independently tunable parameters to study the coupled transport behavior of optical power and energy in symmetric junctions composed of waveguides at negative temperatures.
%We extracted the conductance, thermal conductance, and Seebeck coefficients in the optical system using the method of extracting transport coefficients in cold atomic gases\cite{brantut_thermoelectric_2013,grenier_thermoelectric_2016} and then performed a qualitative analysis by non-equilibrium Green's functions, 
%revealing signs that the system violates the W-F law.	


%In MOFs, exchange of power and energy between different modes leads to rich nonlinear dynamical behaviors such as beam self-cleaning \cite{krupa_spatial_2017,liu_kerr_2016,niang_spatial_2019}, 
%spatiotemporal solitons\cite{herr_temporal_2014,wright_controllable_2015,kalashnikov_stabilization_2022},
%mode-locking \cite{wright_spatiotemporal_2017}.
%They can be ultimately linked with thermalization\cite{jung_thermal_2022,pyrialakos_thermalization_2022,shi_controlling_2021,leykam_probing_2021}, condensation\cite{bloch_non-equilibrium_2022,xiong_k-space_2022,baudin_classical_2020} and other thermodynamic processes of optical modes. 
%Wherein, the weak nonlinearity plays the role of collisions among ideal gas molecules, allowing the system to reach the equilibrium Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) distribution for conserved total power and energy\cite{pourbeyram_direct_2022}.
%These studies provide strong support for studying the nonequilibrium dynamics of such multimode systems within the framework of statistical mechanics.

%Based on this, the thermalization of orbital angular momentum in multimode fibers\cite{podivilov_thermalization_2022,wu_thermalization_2022},  Bose-Einstein condensation, and the dynamics of thermalization in optical lattice systems\cite{jung_thermal_2022,pyrialakos_thermalization_2022,shi_controlling_2021,leykam_probing_2021} have been studied successively,
%which provides support for studying the nonequilibrium dynamics of such multimode systems.


%When an isolated system initially deviates from equilibrium, it relaxes to equilibrium through particle and heat exchange within the system.
%This behavior can be characterized by the `diagonal' particle $G$ and thermal conductance $G_T$, and the `off-diagonal' Seebeck and Peltier-type coefficients within linear irreversible thermodynamics\cite{callen1951irreversibility}. 
%Coupled particle and energy transport has been

%The ratio of conductance to thermal conductance, $L=G_T/\left( TG \right)$, is known as the Lorenz number, is robust in low-temperature Fermi liquids, and is known as the Wiedemann-Franz law.
%However, in strongly correlated systems, the Wiedemann-Franz law breaks down\cite{lee_anomalously_2017,husmann_breakdown_2018}.
%
%Since particles are carriers of energy, transport is usually coupled together\cite{iubini_nonequilibrium_2012,iubini_coupled_2019}, 
%and this coupled transport behavior has been extensively studied in cold atomic systems\cite{brantut_thermoelectric_2013,nietner_transport_2014,gallego-marcos_nonequilibrium_2014,hausler_interaction-assisted_2021},

%\section{Model \& Theory} \label{Model_Theory}
%\subsection{Model}  \label{Model}
{\bf Model --}
We consider transport junction made from one-dimensional waveguide arrays. The junction consists of two large but finite-size reservoirs connected by a chain.  We study coupled heat and power transport properties across the chain. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:1a}, each node represents a waveguide, along which ($z$ direction) the optical wave can propagate. In the reservoir the nodes are periodically arranged. This is a prototypical junction structure to study transport properties of solid-state \cite{agrait2003quantum} and cold atom systems\cite{krinner2017two}. 
%
%HAMILTONIAN
%Total Hamiltonian of the system contains a linear part $H_L$ and a nonlinear part $H_{NL}$, written as\cite{wu_thermodynamic_2019,rasmussen_statistical_2000}
%\begin{equation} 
%  H\left( \psi _m,i\psi _{m}^{*} \right) =\sum_{m,n}^{\mathcal{M}}{\kappa _{mn}\psi _{m}^{*}\psi _n}+\frac{1}{2}\chi \sum_m^{\mathcal{M}}{\left| \psi _m \right|^4}.
%      \label{equ:H}
%\end{equation}
%Here, $\psi _{m}$  is the normalized optical field complex amplitude at node $m$, which forms the canonical conjugate pairs with $i\psi _{m}^{*}$, $\mathcal{M}$ is the set of nodes, $\kappa _{mn}=\kappa _{mn}^{*}$ is the normalized coupling coefficient between node $m$ and node $n$. We consider only the nearest neighbour coupling. 
%Finally, $\chi$ is a parameter associated with the Kerr type nonlinearality of the system.
%HAMILTONIAN

%Here we consider two types of symmetric junctions whose reservoirs are made from square and hexagonal honeycomb lattices, respectively.
%We choose size of $N_x*N_y=19*19$ for square lattices, and $N_x*N_y=16*31$ for honeycomb lattices, where $N_x$ and $N_y$ are the numbers of waveguides arranged in the $x$-direction and $y$-direction, respectively.
%Initially, the two reservoirs are in their respective equilibrium states. After turning on their coupling to the chain simultaneously, transfer of energy and optical power (particle number) occurs. 
%Eventually, the whole system evolves to a new equilibrium state.

%Using Eq.~(\ref{equ:H}), 
Propagation of the optical modes along the waveguides is described by 
the discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (DNSE)\cite{lederer_discrete_2008,agrawal_applications_2001}
\begin{equation} 
i\frac{d\psi _{m}}{dz}+\kappa \sum_{\{n\}}{\psi _{n}}+\chi \left| \psi _{m} \right|^2\psi _{m}=0,
  \label{equ:DNES}
\end{equation}
with dimensionless parameters $\psi_m$, $\kappa$, $\chi$ representing the complex wave amplitude, the nearest neighbour coupling between waveguides and Kerr-type nonlinear coefficient, respectively.  
Here the coordinate $z$ along waveguide plays the role of time in standard Schr\"odinger equation, and $\{n\}$ includes all the nearest neighbours of $m$. 
%

For weak nonlinear interactions, we can  diagonalize the linear term and obtain the corresponding eigenmode (supermode) propagating constant $\beta_k$ and corresponding vector $\varphi_k$. For a given state $\psi$, the modal occupancy is obtained by projection onto each supermode 
$\left|c_k\right|^2=\left| \langle \varphi _k | \psi \rangle \right|^2$.
%
The system evolves with conserved internal energy
%\begin{align}
$U=\sum_{k=1}^M{\varepsilon _k\left| c_k \right|^2}	$
%  \label{eq:ud}
%\end{align}
and optical power
%\begin{align}
$P=\sum_{k=1}^M{\left| c_k \right|^2}$,
%        \label{eq:pd}
%\end{align}
with the total number of modes $M$, the eigen energy defined by the negative of $\beta$ as $\varepsilon_k = -\beta_k$, and $\beta _1\ge \beta _2\ge \cdots \ge \beta _M$. The system thus has a bounded energy spectrum between $[\varepsilon_1, \varepsilon_M]$.
The weak nonlinear part introduces coupling among different supermodes, such that the system can thermalize to an equilibrium state through energy and power redistribution among supermodes. It plays a role similar to molecular collisions in the ideal gas model.
%\revision{
%The mode occupancy $\left|c_i\right|^2=\left| \langle \varphi _i | \Psi \rangle \right|^2$ is obtained by projecting the optical field complex amplitude vector $\Psi =\left( \psi _{11},\psi _{12},\cdots ,\psi _{ij},\cdots \right) ^T$ onto the supermode eigenvector $\left| \varphi _i \right> $, 
%and $\varepsilon _i=-\beta _i$ is the negative of the eigenvalue of ${H}_L$, $\beta$ is the mode propagation constant and satisfies $\beta _1\ge \beta _2\ge \cdots \ge \beta _M$.
%The role of nonlinear Hamiltonian is to introduce interaction between different supermodes, such that energy and power can redistribute among them, similar to collisions between gas molecules in the ideal gas model.

{\bf Equilibrium thermodynamic theory --} 
We can use a recently developed optical thermodynamic theory to describe each reservoir\cite{wu_thermodynamic_2019}. The system internal energy can be written as (omitting the reservoir index)
\begin{align}
	U = M T + \mu P,
 \label{eq:eos}
\end{align}
where $T$ is the dimensionless optical temperature, $\mu$ is the chemical potential. An optical entropy can be defined as 
\begin{align}
S=\sum_{k=1}^M{\ln \left| c_k \right|^2}. 
\end{align}
Using the maximum entropy principle, at thermal equilibrium, the mode occupancy follows the classical Rayleigh-Jeans (R-J) distribution 
\begin{align}
	f(\varepsilon_k) = \left| c_k \right|^2=\frac{T}{\varepsilon _k-\mu}.
	\label{eq:rj}
\end{align}


One prominent feature of the system is that, for given power $P$, the 
optical entropy $S$ no longer varies monotonically with the internal energy $U$ due to bounded energy spectrum. Consequently, the system can reach the  negative optical temperature regime\cite{wu_thermodynamic_2019,wu_entropic_2020}.
%
From Eqs.~(\ref{eq:eos}-\ref{eq:rj}), we have plotted the phase diagram of the reservoir with square lattice. As shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:1b}, only $\left\{ \left( T,\mu \right) |T<0,\mu >\varepsilon _M \right\}$ and $\left\{ \left( T,\mu \right) |T>0,\mu <\varepsilon _1 \right\}$ can be visited, and the other regimes are forbidden($R_f$). This follows from the requirement $\left| c_k \right|^2 \ge 0$.  Moreover, the chemical potential is out of the band spectrum of the system, i.e., $\mu$ is below (above) the lowest (highest) energy of the spectrum for positive (negative) temperature. The positive and negative temperature regimes are anti-symmetric with each other in the phase diagram when neglecting the nonlinear effect.  
In the following, we focus on the negative temperature regime and numerically check that this anti-symmetry is still approximately valid in the weakly nonlinear regime (Fig.~\ref{fig:3}).

%The presence of nonlinearity breaks the symmetry of the system in the positive ($R_p$) and negative ($R_n$) temperature region. Larger input power in $R_p$ region may generate modulation instability, resulting in a significant transfer of internal energy to the nonlinear part\cite{xiong_k-space_2022}.
%This leads to states that deviates from prediction from the thermodynamic theory.
%For $R_n$, there is no restriction on the input power. Therefore, in the present work we mainly focus on the $R_n$ region of the phase space.

%\subsection{Transport coefficients in the microcanonical ensemble}  \label{microcanonical}
{\bf Transport coefficients in microcanonical ensemble --} 
Transport theory is normally formulated with open boundaries using grand canonical ensemble.  Due to the finite size of present junction, it is convenient to utilize the microcanonical setup. We extract the transport coefficients by following the thermalization process of a microcanonical system from given initial conditions.
%In order to extract the transport coefficients from the evolution equation, we employ the irreversible thermodynamic theory to 
Using the theory of irreversible thermodynamics, 
%we can make connection between the driving affinities $\varDelta \mu$, $\varDelta T$ with the corresponding power ($I_P$) and entropy ($I_S$) fluxes, which follow the Onsager symmetry
%%$I_P=\partial \left( P_R-P_L \right) /\left( 2\partial z \right) $ and $I_S=\partial \left( S_R-S_L \right) /\left( 2\partial z \right)$.
%\begin{equation} 
%\left( \begin{array}{c}
%	I_P\\
%	I_S\\
%\end{array} \right) =\left( \begin{matrix}
%	K_0&		K_1/T\\
%	K_1/T&		K_2/T^2\\
%\end{matrix} \right) \left( \begin{array}{c}
%	\Delta \mu\\
%	\Delta T\\
%\end{array} \right). 
%\label{equ:1}
%\end{equation}
%The positive direction of the current is chosen as from $L$ to $R$ reservoir.
%%
%The matrix elements $K_0$, $K_1$ and $K_2$ depend on the state of the system and can be expressed in terms of the power conductance $G$, the thermal conductance $G_T$, the Seebeck coefficient $\alpha _{c}$ and the Lorenz number $L=G_T/TG$,
%\begin{equation} 
%  \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left( \begin{array}{c}
%    \Delta P\\
%    \Delta S\\
%  \end{array} \right) =-2G\left( \begin{matrix}
%    1&		\alpha _{{c}}\\
%    \alpha _{{c}}&		L+\alpha _{{c}}^{2}\\
%  \end{matrix} \right) \left( \begin{array}{c}
%    \Delta \mu\\
%    \Delta T\\
%  \end{array} \right) 
%  \label{equ:2}
%\end{equation}
%%
%%These transport coefficients characterize the process by which the two reservoirs exchange optical power and energy through the chain to relax the system to an equilibrium state.
%%Where the transport process occurs mainly in the chain, and the reservoirs as macroscopic systems can be described by thermodynamic methods, the transport coefficients should not depend on the size of the reservoirs, i.e., the structure should be convergent.
%%The convergence tests of the symmetric junctions used in the calculations of this work are shown in Appendix~\ref{B}.
%%
%%Since the optical power proportion in the chain at equilibrium is $P_c/P_s<M_c/M_s$, where $M_s$ and $M_c$ are the waveguide numbers of the system and the chain, respectively. So we always keep $M_c/M_s<0.01$ in all our simulations to ignore the effect of the optical power in the chain.
%
%%We now describe the evolution of the optical power and internal energy of the two reservoirs caused by the temperature and chemical potential differences. 
%Due to the weak link between the two reservoirs, the bottleneck of the thermalization process is at the central chain. 
%For the two reservoirs, the thermalization can be considered as a quasi-static process, \revision{which can be verified by tracking the evolution of the system.} 
%This allows us to introduce the thermodynamic equation of the reservoir to extend the above results to the time evolution of the biases.
%Using the Maxwell's relations $\left. \left( \partial S/\partial \mu \right) \right|_T=\left. \left( \partial P/\partial T \right) \right|_{\mu}$ and $-\left. \left( \partial S/\partial P \right) \right|_T=\left. \left( \partial \mu /\partial T \right) \right|_P$, we can obtain
%\begin{eqnarray}
%  dP=\left. \frac{\partial P}{\partial \mu} \right|_Td\mu +\left. \frac{\partial P}{\partial T} \right|_{\mu}dT=\kappa d\mu +\alpha _r\kappa dT,
%  \label{equ:3}
%  \\
%  dS=\left. \frac{\partial S}{\partial P} \right|_TdP+\left. \frac{\partial S}{\partial T} \right|_PdT=\alpha _rdP+\kappa ldT
%  \label{equ:4}
%\end{eqnarray}
%where $\kappa =\left. \left( \partial P/\partial \mu \right) \right|_T$, $\alpha _r=-\left. \left( \partial \mu /\partial T \right) \right|_P$, $l=C_P/T\kappa $ are the compression coefficient, Seebeck coefficient and Lorenz number of a single reservoir, respectively.
%Here $C_P=\left. T\left( \partial S/\partial T \right) \right|_P$ is the reservoir heat capacity at constant power.  They can be determined by the definition of optical power and optical entropy.
%
%With Eqs.~(\ref{equ:2}-\ref{equ:4}), 
we can obtain the evolution equations of $\Delta P$ and $\Delta T$ (See Appendix~\ref{C}). 
For symmetric junctions with identical left and right reservoirs, 
they read
\begin{equation} 
  \tau _0\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left( \begin{array}{c}
    \Delta P\\
    \Delta T\\
  \end{array} \right) =-\left( \begin{matrix}
    1&		-\kappa \alpha\\
    -\frac{\alpha}{\ell \kappa}&		\frac{L+\alpha ^2}{\ell}\\
  \end{matrix} \right) \left( \begin{array}{c}
    \Delta P\\
    \Delta T\\
  \end{array} \right) 
  \label{equ:5}
\end{equation}
where we have defined a transport timescale $\tau _0=\kappa /\left( 2G \right)$ .
%the Seebeck coefficient $\alpha =\alpha _r-\alpha _c$. 
%\revision{what is $\alpha_c$?}
Here, the reservoir properties $\kappa =\left. \left( \partial P/\partial \mu \right) \right|_T$, $\alpha _r=-\left. \left( \partial \mu /\partial T \right) \right|_P$, $C_P=\left. T\left( \partial S/\partial T \right) \right|_P$ are the compression coefficient, Seebeck coefficient and the heat capacity at constant power, respectively,
with $l=C_P/T\kappa$.
They can be obtained from the thermodynamic relations [Eqs.~(\ref{equ:kappa}-\ref{equ:CP})]. 
The effective Seebeck coefficient $\alpha=\alpha_r-\alpha_c$ characterizes the difference between the reservoir itself $\alpha_r$ and the whole junction $\alpha_c$.

\begin{comment}

It is worth noting that the NEGF is calculated for the case of two reservoirs coupled separately to the bathes, so the thermodynamic coefficients obtained characterize the whole system. 
However, it can be found that when the reservoir is large enough, the thermodynamic coefficients depend significantly on the structure of the chain, so we approximate them as parameters of the chain.

%\section{Results \& Discussions} \label{Results}
%\subsection{Symmetric junction with square reservoirs} \label{square}
{\bf Numerical Results --} 
Figure~\ref{fig:3a}-\ref{fig:3d} shows temperature dependence of the transport coefficients for a symmetric junction with square-lattice reservoirs. 
We notice that, in the negative temperature regime, conductance $G<0$, indicating that the power is transferred from the low to the high chemical potential reservoir when $\varDelta T=0$. This seemingly surprising result does not violate the second law of thermodynamics.
Considering two subsystems that can exchange particles with each other under constant temperature, the second law of thermodynamics requires that the entropy does not decrease during the particle exchange
\begin{equation} 
  dS=\left( \frac{\mu _L}{T_L}-\frac{\mu _R}{T_R} \right) dP \ge 0
  \label{equ:9}
\end{equation}
where $dP$ is the power lost from the left reservoir or gained from the right reservoir.
When $T_L=T_R>0$, the power is transferred from high to low chemical potential. However, when $T_L=T_R<0$, the direction is reversed, meaning $G<0$. Since heat is transferred from high to low temperature in both positive and negative temperature regions, we have $G_T>0$. 

Figure~\ref{fig:3a} shows an approximated linear $T$ dependence of $G$ for all the nonlinear parameters considered. This can be understood qualitatively from the Landauer formalism (Appendix~\ref{sec:lt}). 
%
%The results are in the same order of magnitude as the NEGF calculations and observe that the conductance expected by the Landauer model is proportional to temperature. 
%As the nonlinearity decreases, the power exchange process between the modes weakens, resulting in the smaller $\left| G \right|$, while deviating from the results predicted by the Landauer model. 
%This is because the $\gamma$ terms coupled to the bath in the NEGF make the calculation deviate from the microcanonical system's relevant results. It can be found that if $\gamma$ is reduced, the $\left| G \right|$ calculated by the Landauer model is also reduced.
%
%Unlike the fermionic system in the low temperature regime where only the energy states near the Fermi energy level contribute to the conductance, according to
The conductance can be approximated as 
\begin{equation} 
  G=\int {\frac{d\varepsilon}{2\pi}{\mathcal{T}}(\varepsilon) \frac{T}{\left( \varepsilon -\mu \right) ^2}},
  \label{equ:G}
\end{equation}
indicating $G \propto T$ for temperature independent transmission $\mathcal{T}(\varepsilon)$. Moreover, the optical modes contribute to the transport with a weighting factor inversely proportional to the square of the energy deviation from the chemical potential.  
%Similar analysis using the Landauer formalism shows that the thermal conductance $G_T$ does not depend on temperature. The numerical results shows relatively weak dependence, due to the weak nonlinear effect. 
%As shown in Fig.~(\ref{fig:3a}), as the temperature decreases, i.e., $\left| T \right|$ increases, the weighting factor $\left| T/\left( \varepsilon -\mu \right) ^2 \right|$ of the conductance increases, causing $\left| G \right|$ to increase.

Temperature dependence of the Seebeck coefficient $\alpha_c$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:3b}. It can be well fitted by an inverse $T$ dependence $\alpha_c \propto -1/T$ predicted by the Landauer model. 
%\revision{Since only one quasiparticle contributes to the thermoelectric behavior, this makes $\alpha _c$ always positive within $R_p$ and $R_n$.}
%However, the conductance in the positive and negative temperature regions flips, and flip the direction of the thermoelectric power current by $\underset{\Delta T\rightarrow 0}{\lim}\left. I_P/\Delta T \right|_{\Delta \mu =0}=\alpha _{c}G$, the power will be transported from the hot end to the cold end at positive temperature and from the cold end to the hot end at negative temperature.
%This result is natural, as can also be seen from the power $P=\sum_{i=1}^M{T/\left( \varepsilon _i-\mu \right)}$. Initially, when the two reservoirs have the same chemical potential, when $T_L>T_R>0$,there is $P_L>P_R$; when $0>T_L>T_R$,there is $P_L<P_R$.
%
The little effect of nonlinear interaction on $\alpha_c$ can also be captured by the Landuer result. In fact, $\alpha_c$ can be written as $\alpha _c = K_1/(K_0T)$. $K_0$ and $K_1$ have similar dependence on the nonlinear interaction, they cancel with each other in $\alpha_c$. 

Similar to conductance, the thermal conductance $G_T$ also increases with nonlinearity (Fig.~\ref{fig:3c}). From the Landauer formalism, we get
\begin{equation} 
  G_T=\int {\frac{d\varepsilon}{2\pi}}\mathcal{T}(\varepsilon) -T\alpha _{c}^{2}G.
  \label{equ:15}
\end{equation}
This gives a temperature independent $G_T$. Similar to $G$, the temperature dependence in the numerical results is due to nonlinear interaction.  
The second term on the right side of Eq.~(\ref{equ:15}) represents correction to the thermal conductance due to Seebeck coefficient. Here, its magnitude is comparable to the first term. This is in contrast to the case of electrons in condensed matter system, where the thermoelectric correction is often negligible.  
%When the optical power and temperature difference are uncoupled, $G_T$ is a quantity that depends only on the structure of the system.
%For the symmetric junction made up of square reservoirs in our setup, the first term at the right end of Eq.~(\ref{equ:15}) is 0.49.
%However, in the results of Fig.~\ref{fig:3c}, $G_T$ is one order of magnitude less, indicating that the thermopower strongly suppresses the heat transfer.
%This is different from the result that the correction term is negligible in traditional materials.
%The reason is that $T$ and $\mu$ are not equivalent in conventional materials, and their units are K and J, respectively, leading to the thermal potential $\alpha _c=-\partial \mu /\partial T$ that is often of the same order as $k_B$, but in multimode fiber systems, both $T$ and $\mu$ characterize the disorder of the optical field, so $\alpha _c$ is on the order of $10^0$, which makes the correction term non-negligible.
%This means that the temperature relaxation is accomplished primarily through power exchange rather than heat.

%Next, we focus on the the Lorenz number $L$. 
The variation of $L$ with temperature and chemical potential is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:3d}, and is once again captured by Landauer's theory. 
It can be found that the Lorenz number is more sensitive to temperature than the chemical potential (Inset).
In the Landauer picture, $G_T \propto T^0$ together with $G \propto T$ leads to $L \propto 1/T^2$, which violates the W-F law. The decrease in $L$ with decreasing temperature comes from the increase in $\left| G \right|$.
Similar to $\alpha _{c}$, we also observe a rather weak dependence on the strength of nonlinear interaction. Thus, the violation of W-F law here is not due to nonlinear interaction. Rather, its origin is similar to that in coherent mescoscopic conductors, which can be fully accounted by the single particle Landauer formalism.


%\subsection{Symmetric junction with hexagonal honeycomb reservoirs} \label{honeycomb}

% Figure environment removed

To further illustrate the violation of the W-F law, we considered a symmetric junction made from hexagonal honeycomb reservoirs with the same bandwidth (Fig.~\ref{fig:1a}).
Junction with hexagonal reservoirs has a broader transmission spectrum compared to that with square reservoirs (Fig.~\ref{fig:T}).
This is due to the two van Hove singularities unique to hexagonal lattice, particularly evident in the DOS (Fig.~\ref{fig:DOS}), giving higher transmission to the modes near the band edges.
This makes the thermal conductivity increase to about twice that of the square case.
As a result, we observe a more severe violation of the W-F law (Fig.~\ref{fig:5}), albeit with the same $1/T^2$ dependence. 



%\section{CONCLUSION} \label{CONCLUSION}
{\bf Conclusions --}
We have developed a theory based on microcanonical ensemble 
to extract the transport coefficients of the coupled thermal and power transport in coupled waveguide arrays. We found a systematic violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law with the Lorenz number $L \propto 1/T^2$. 
The numerical results can be understood  from the classical limit of Landauer formula. Our theory based on microcanonical ensemble is compatible to experimental realizations.   
Thus, it paves the way of studying fundamental nonequilibrium thermodynamic processes  in parameters regimes that are unreachable in condensed matter and atomic gas systems. 

%Using the nonequilibrium Green's function method, we reveal that the Lorentz number $L\propto 1/T^2$ of the system, which violates the Wiedemann-Franz law, is caused by the different ways of mode contributions to the conductance and thermal conductance.
%The two Van Hove singularities unique to hexagonal honeycomb symmetric junction lead to the thermal conductance twice as high as that of the square reservoir symmetric junction, which makes the Lorentz number of the system vary more significantly.
%As the nonlinearity gradually increases, $\left| G \right|$ and $G_T$ will increase, indicating that nonlinearity promotes the thermalization of the system. However, the composite parameters $\alpha _c$ and L are insensitive to the change of nonlinearity.
%Our work provides the possibility to measure the transport coefficients of optical systems in experiments, and by changing the structure of the reservoir, many interesting coupled transport phenomena can be observed.

%\section{The discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation} \label{A}
%\setcounter{figure}{0} 
%We briefly illustrate the derivation of DNSE following closely Ref.~\onlinecite{agrawal_applications_2001}. 
%Neglecting the loss of the waveguide, the transmission of the optical field is described by the following Helmholtz equation
%%In discrete fiber systems with identical cores, from the coupled mode theory one can obtain the following control equation to describe \revision{XXXX}
%\begin{equation} 
%  \nabla ^2\boldsymbol{\tilde{E}}\left( \boldsymbol{r,}\omega \right) +\tilde{n}^2\left( x,y \right) k_{0}^{2}\boldsymbol{\tilde{E}}\left( \boldsymbol{r,}\omega \right) =0,
%  \label{equ:Hel}
%\end{equation}
%where $k_{0}$ is the wave vector in the vacuum, $\tilde{n}$ is the refractive index associated with the field strength, and $\boldsymbol{\tilde{E}}$ is the electric field distribution over the frequency domain.
%Assuming that the direction of electric field polarization $\boldsymbol{\hat{e}}$ remains constant during the transmission, the electric field can be approximated as
%\begin{equation} 
%  \boldsymbol{\tilde{E}}\left( \boldsymbol{r,}\omega \right) \approx \boldsymbol{\hat{e}}\sum_{m=1}^M{\tilde{A}_m\left( Z,\omega \right) F_m\left( x,y \right)}e^{i\beta Z},
%  \label{equ:E}
%\end{equation}
%where $Z$ is the transmission distance, $m$ is the waveguide indicator, $\beta$ is the propagation constant, and $\tilde{A}$ is the complex amplitude of the optical field. Substituting Eq.~(\ref{equ:E}) into Eq.~(\ref{equ:Hel}), since $\tilde{A}$ is a slow-varying function, $\partial ^2\tilde{A}/\partial Z^2$ can be neglected, we can then obtain
%\begin{equation} 
%  \sum_{m=1}^M{i\frac{\partial \tilde{A}_m}{\partial Z}F_m+\left[ \frac{\left( \tilde{n}^2-n_{m}^{2} \right) k_{0}^{2}+\bar{\beta}_{m}^{2}-\beta ^2}{2\beta} \right] \tilde{A}_mF_m}=0,
%  \label{equ:A1}
%\end{equation}
%where $\bar{\beta}_{m}$ is the mode propagation constant.
%
%Assuming that $F_m$ has been normalized and the overlap integral between different waveguides is zero, i.e., $\iint_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{F_{n}^{*}\left( x,y \right) F_m\left( x,y \right) dxdy}=\delta _{m,n}$, the coupled-mode equations can be obtained
%\begin{equation} 
%  \frac{\partial \tilde{A}_m}{\partial Z}=i\left( \bar{\beta}_m+\Delta \beta _{m}^{NL}-\beta \right) \tilde{A}_m+i\sum_{n\ne m}^M{\mathcal{K}_{mn}\tilde{A}_n},
%  \label{equ:A2}
%\end{equation}
%the coupling coefficient $\mathcal{K}$ and the nonlinear interaction $\Delta \beta _{m}^{NL}$ are defined as
%	\begin{align}
%    \mathcal{K}_{mn}=\frac{k_{0}^{2}}{2\beta}\iint_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{\left( \tilde{n}^2-n_{n}^{2} \right) F_{m}^{*}F_ndxdy},
%  \label{equ:K}\\
%  \Delta \beta _{m}^{NL}=\frac{k_{0}^{2}}{2\beta}\iint_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{\left( \tilde{n}^2-n_{m}^{2} \right) F_{m}^{*}F_mdxdy}.
%  \label{equ:Beta}
%	\end{align}
%
%Expanding $\bar{\beta}_m\left( \omega \right)$ to second order near the center frequency $\omega_0$ of the quasi-monochromatic optical field and neglecting the frequency dependence of $\mathcal{K}$, the time domain form of Eq.~(\ref{equ:A2}) is
%\begin{equation}
%  \begin{aligned}
%  & \frac{\partial A_m}{\partial Z}+\beta_{1 m} \frac{\partial A_m}{\partial t}+\frac{i}{2} \beta_{2 m} \frac{\partial^2 A_m}{\partial t^2} \\
%  & =i\sum_{n\ne m}^M{\mathcal{K} _{mn}A_n}+i\left( \delta _m+k_0\iint_{-\infty}^{+\infty}{\Delta n_m\left| F_m \right|^2dxdy} \right) A_m
%  \label{equ:A3}
%  \end{aligned}
%\end{equation}
%where $\delta _m=\beta _{0m}-\beta$ is the amount of asymmetry between the waveguides, and is set to $\delta _m=0$, $\beta _{1m}$ is the reciprocal of the group velocity, and $\beta _{2m}$ is the group velocity dispersion of the waveguides. $\Delta n_m$ is the amount of refractive index change due to third-order nonlinearity $\chi ^{\left( 3 \right)}$. Assuming that the phase matching condition is not satisfied, the nonlinear effect does not produce new frequencies and $\Delta n_m$ can be expressed as
%\begin{equation} 
%  \Delta n_m=
%  n_2 \left( \left| E_m \right|^2+2\sum_{n\ne m}^M{\left| E_n \right|^2} \right), 
%  \label{equ:Dn}
%\end{equation}
%here, $n_2=3\text{Re}\left( \chi ^{\left( 3 \right)} \right)/{8n} $ is the nonlinear refractive index coefficient. Combining Eqs.~(\ref{equ:A3}-\ref{equ:Dn}), the coupled-mode equations for symmetric couplers can be obtained
%
%\begin{equation}
%  \begin{aligned}
%  & \frac{\partial A_m}{\partial z}+\beta _{1m}\frac{\partial A_m}{\partial t}+\frac{i}{2}\beta _{2m}\frac{\partial ^2A_m}{\partial t^2} \\
%  & =i\sum_{n\ne m}^M{\mathcal{K} _{mn}A_n}+i\left( \mathcal{X} \left| A_m \right|^2+\sum_{n\ne m}^M{C_{mn}\left| A_n \right|^2} \right) A_m
%  \label{equ:DN}
%  \end{aligned}
%\end{equation}
%where $\mathcal{X} _m$ is the self-phase modulation (SPM) parameter and $C_{mn}$ is the cross-phase modulation (XPM) parameter, respectively, defined as
%
%\begin{align}
%  \mathcal{X}=n_2k_0\iint_{-\infty}^{\infty}{\left| F_m \right|^4dxdy},
%\label{equ:spm}\\
%C_{mn}=2n_2k_0\iint_{-\infty}^{\infty}{\left| F_m \right|^2\left| F_n \right|^2dxdy}.
%\label{equ:xpm}
%\end{align}
%When a continuous beam is injected from one end, the time derivative term of Eq.~(\ref{equ:DN}) is negligible. $C_{mn}$ leads to a small value due to the overlap integral involving different waveguides, which is usually neglected. At this point, Eq.~(\ref{equ:DN}) is reduced to
%\begin{equation} 
%  i\frac{dA_m}{dZ}+\mathcal{K}\sum_{n\ne m}^{\mathcal{M}}{A_{n}}+\mathcal{X}\left| A_m \right|^2A_m=0

\section{Evolution equations for $\Delta P$ and $\Delta T$} \label{C}
\setcounter{figure}{0} 
Using the theory of irreversible thermodynamics, we can make connection between the driving affinities $\varDelta \mu$, $\varDelta T$ with the corresponding power ($I_P$) and entropy ($I_S$) fluxes, which follow the Onsager symmetry
\begin{equation} 
\left( \begin{array}{c}
	I_P\\
	I_S\\
\end{array} \right) =\left( \begin{matrix}
	K_0&		K_1/T\\
	K_1/T&		K_2/T^2\\
\end{matrix} \right) \left( \begin{array}{c}
	\Delta \mu\\
	\Delta T\\
\end{array} \right). 
\label{equ:1}
\end{equation}
Positive direction of the current is chosen as from $L$ to $R$ reservoir.
The matrix elements $K_0$, $K_1$ and $K_2$ depend on the state of the system and can be expressed in terms of the power conductance $G$, the thermal conductance $G_T$, the Seebeck coefficient $\alpha _{c}$ and the Lorenz number $L=G_T/TG$,
\begin{equation} 
  \frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left( \begin{array}{c}
    \Delta P\\
    \Delta S\\
  \end{array} \right) =-2G\left( \begin{matrix}
    1&		\alpha _{{c}}\\
    \alpha _{{c}}&		L+\alpha _{{c}}^{2}\\
  \end{matrix} \right) \left( \begin{array}{c}
    \Delta \mu\\
    \Delta T\\
  \end{array} \right) 
  \label{equ:2}
\end{equation}
%
%These transport coefficients characterize the process by which the two reservoirs exchange optical power and energy through the chain to relax the system to an equilibrium state.
%Where the transport process occurs mainly in the chain, and the reservoirs as macroscopic systems can be described by thermodynamic methods, the transport coefficients should not depend on the size of the reservoirs, i.e., the structure should be convergent.
%The convergence tests of the symmetric junctions used in the calculations of this work are shown in Appendix~\ref{B}.
%
%Since the optical power proportion in the chain at equilibrium is $P_c/P_s<M_c/M_s$, where $M_s$ and $M_c$ are the waveguide numbers of the system and the chain, respectively. So we always keep $M_c/M_s<0.01$ in all our simulations to ignore the effect of the optical power in the chain.
%
%We now describe the evolution of the optical power and internal energy of the two reservoirs caused by the temperature and chemical potential differences. 

Due to the weak link between the two reservoirs, bottleneck of the thermalization process is at the central chain. 
For the two reservoirs, the thermalization can be considered as a quasi-static process, where the two reservoirs can reach local equilibrium much faster than the whole junction. This can be verified by tracking the evolution of the system, and  
allows us to use the thermodynamic equation of the reservoirs.
Using the Maxwell's relations $\left. \left( \partial S/\partial \mu \right) \right|_T=\left. \left( \partial P/\partial T \right) \right|_{\mu}$ and $-\left. \left( \partial S/\partial P \right) \right|_T=\left. \left( \partial \mu /\partial T \right) \right|_P$, we can obtain
\begin{eqnarray}
  dP=\left. \frac{\partial P}{\partial \mu} \right|_Td\mu +\left. \frac{\partial P}{\partial T} \right|_{\mu}dT=\kappa d\mu +\alpha _r\kappa dT,
  \label{equ:3}
  \\
  dS=\left. \frac{\partial S}{\partial P} \right|_TdP+\left. \frac{\partial S}{\partial T} \right|_PdT=\alpha _rdP+\kappa ldT
  \label{equ:4}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\kappa =\left. \left( \partial P/\partial \mu \right) \right|_T$, $\alpha _r=-\left. \left( \partial \mu /\partial T \right) \right|_P$, $l=C_P/T\kappa $ are the compression coefficient, Seebeck coefficient and Lorenz number of the reservoir, respectively,
with $C_P=\left. T\left( \partial S/\partial T \right) \right|_P$ the reservoir heat capacity at constant power.  
In the linear response regime, they can be obtained from the equilibrium thermodynamic state at $\bar{T}$ and $\bar{\mu}$ as 
\begin{equation} 
  \kappa =\left. \sum_i^M{\frac{T}{\left( \varepsilon _i-\mu \right) ^2}} \right|_T,
  \label{equ:kappa}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} 
  \alpha _r=\frac{1}{\kappa}\left. \sum_{i=1}^M{\frac{1}{\varepsilon _i-\mu}} \right|_{\mu},
  \label{equ:alpha}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} 
  C_P=M-T\alpha _{r}^{2}\kappa.
  \label{equ:CP}
\end{equation}

%With Eqs.~(\ref{equ:2}-\ref{equ:4}), we can obtain the evolution equations of $\Delta P$ and $\Delta T$. 
%% The general case of different types of reservoirs is discussed in the appendix.
%For symmetric junctions with identical left and right reservoirs, 
%they read
%\begin{equation} 
%  \tau _0\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left( \begin{array}{c}
%    \Delta P\\
%    \Delta T\\

%    \Delta P\\
%    \Delta T\\
%  \end{array} \right) 
%  \label{equ:5}
%\end{equation}
%where we have defined a transport timescales $\tau _0=\kappa /\left( 2G \right)$ and the Seebeck coefficient $\alpha =\alpha _r-\alpha _c$. 
%\revision{This form of the transport matrix highlights that the optical power and temperature dynamics result from a competition between the transport properties of the constriction and the thermodynamical properties of the reservoirs.}
%%
%

According to the thermodynamic equations, Eqs.~(\ref{equ:3}-\ref{equ:4}), the optical power $P(z)$ and entropy $S(z)$ of the reservoir at position $z$ can be written as
\begin{align} 
  P\left( z \right) &=\kappa \mu \left( z \right) +\alpha _r\kappa T\left( z \right) +A,
  \label{AP_B_1}\\
  S\left( z \right) &=\alpha _rP\left( z \right) +\kappa lT\left( z \right) +B
  \label{AP_B_2}
\end{align}
where $A$ and $B$ are constants related to the initial conditions. We have dropped the reservoir index. When the left and right reservoirs are identical, their thermodynamic parameters are also identical, $A_L=A_R$ and $B_L=B_R$.
Then, the optical power ($\Delta P\left( z \right) $) and entropy ($\Delta S\left( z \right) $) difference can be written as
\begin{align} 
  \Delta P\left( z \right)&=\kappa \Delta \mu \left( z \right) +\alpha _r\kappa \Delta T\left( z \right), 
  \label{AP_B_3}\\
  \Delta S\left( z \right)&=\alpha _r\Delta P\left( z \right)+\kappa l\Delta T\left( z \right).
  \label{AP_B_4}
\end{align}
Using $\Delta P$ and $\Delta T$ to eliminate $\Delta S$ and $\Delta \mu$ in Eq.~(\ref{equ:2}), the evolution equations are obtained
\begin{equation} 
  \tau _0\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\left( \begin{array}{c}
    \Delta P\\
    \Delta T\\
  \end{array} \right) =-\left( \begin{matrix}
    1&		-\kappa \alpha\\
    -\frac{\alpha}{\kappa l}&		\frac{\alpha ^2+L}{l}\\
  \end{matrix} \right) \left( \begin{array}{c}
    \Delta P\\
    \Delta T\\
  \end{array} \right) \equiv -\varLambda \left( \begin{array}{c}
    \Delta P\\
    \Delta T\\
  \end{array} \right) ,
  \label{AP_B_5}
\end{equation}
where we have defined a transport timescale $\tau _0=\kappa /\left( 2G \right)$ and an effective Seebeck coefficient $\alpha =\alpha _r-\alpha _c$. 
The eigen values of matrix $\varLambda $ are 
\begin{equation} 
  \lambda _{\pm}=\frac{1}{2}\left( 1+\frac{\alpha ^2+L}{l} \right) \pm \sqrt{\left( \frac{1}{2}+\frac{\alpha ^2+L}{2l} \right) ^2-\frac{L}{l}}=\delta \pm \varOmega .
  \label{AP_B_6}
\end{equation}
General solutions of Eq.~(\ref{AP_B_5}) can be expressed using the eigen values
\begin{align} 
  \Delta P\left( z \right) &=C_1e^{-\frac{\lambda _+}{\tau _0}z}+C_2e^{-\frac{\lambda _-}{\tau _0}z},
  \label{AP_B_7}\\
  \Delta T\left( z \right) &=C_3e^{-\frac{\lambda _+}{\tau _0}z}+C_4e^{-\frac{\lambda _-}{\tau _0}z},
  \label{AP_B_8}
\end{align}
where the coefficients $C_1$, $C_2$, $C_3$ and $C_4$ are determined by the initial conditions.
Assuming that the initial power and temperature difference are $\Delta P_0$ and $\Delta T_0$, from Eqs.~(\ref{AP_B_5}),  (\ref{AP_B_7}) and  (\ref{AP_B_8}) we get
\begin{align} 
  C_1&=\frac{1+\Omega -\delta}{2\Omega}\Delta P_0-\frac{\kappa \alpha}{2\Omega}\Delta T_0,
  \label{AP_B_9}\\
  C_2&=\frac{\Omega +\delta -1}{2\Omega}\Delta P_0+\frac{\kappa \alpha}{2\Omega}\Delta T_0,
  \label{AP_B_10}\\
  C_3&=-\frac{\alpha}{2\kappa l\Omega}\Delta P_0+\frac{\delta +\Omega -1}{2\Omega}\Delta T_0,
  \label{AP_B_11}\\
  C_4&=\frac{\alpha}{2\kappa l\Omega}\Delta P_0+\frac{\Omega -\delta +1}{2\Omega}\Delta T_0.
  \label{AP_B_12}
\end{align}
Substituting into Eqs.~(\ref{AP_B_7}) and  (\ref{AP_B_8}), we can obtain the evolution equations for $\Delta P$ and $\Delta T$.

\subsection{Numerical simulation}
\setcounter{figure}{0} 
We choose the initial condition of each reservoir by fixing its optical temperature $T_\alpha$ and chemical potential $\mu_\alpha$.  
%We choose the optical temperature $T$ and the chemical potential $\mu$ as adjustable parameters in the initial input.
The corresponding optical power and internal energy can then be obtained. We perform calculations in the linear response regime with $T_L-T_R=\Delta T\ll \bar{T}$, $\mu _L-\mu _R=\Delta \mu \ll \bar{\mu}$. When the left and right reservoirs are identical, the average temperature and chemical potential are $\bar{T}=\left( T_L+T_R \right) /2$ and $\bar{\mu}=\left( \mu _L+\mu _R \right) /2$, respectively. 
%In addition, the initial input in the main text also satisfies $P_L=P_R$ to facilitate the observation of the coupled energy and particle transport.
Figure~\ref{fig:1b} shows seven sets of parameters at fixed chemical potential, all selected on iso-power lines while ensuring the small temperature and chemical potential difference.
The fourth-order Runge-Kutta method was used to solve Eq.~(\ref{equ:DNES}).  
The final result for each given initial condition is ensemble averaged by choosing different random phases for $c_{i}$. 
%For each given initial condition, with different initial conditions, i.e. random phases of $c_{i0}^S$ in the reservoirs. The final result is obtained by performing the ensemble average.
%
%
%and by averaging the evolutionary results of a large number of system integrations for reservoirs with different random phases $\text{arg}\left( c_{i0}^{S} \right)$ in the initial stage to obtaining the $\varPsi \left( z \right) $, where $S\in \left\{ L,R \right\} $.
%For the structure shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:1a}, we trace the modal occupancies evolution of each reservoir through $\left| c_{i}^{S} \right|^2\left( z \right) =\left| \left< \varphi _{i}^{S}\mid \varPsi ^S \right> \right|^2\left( z \right)$, where $\left| \varphi _{i}^{S} \right> $ is the eigenvector of the reservoir and $\varPsi ^S$ is the part of $\varPsi$ that describes the $S$ reservoir.
%When the system is in equilibrium, they will have the same temperature and chemical potential as the system (see the yellow dot in Fig.~\ref{fig:1b}), although they may have different power and internal energy due to differences in reservoir structure.
%
Fig.~\ref{fig:2} shows the calculated results for a symmetric junction with square-lattice reservoirs at $\bar{T}=-1.065$ and $\bar{\mu}=7$.
At the initial stage, driven by temperature and chemical potential deviations, the optical power is rapidly transferred from the cold reservoir to the hot reservoir. After $\Delta P$ reaches saturation, the system is brought to equilibrium by a slow relaxation process.





\subsection{Data Fitting} \label{D}

% Figure environment removed
We use Eqs.~(\ref{equ:6}) and (\ref{equ:7}) to fit the evolution of $\varDelta P$ and $\varDelta T$ simultaneously by scanning the chain parameter space so that the residual $R$ is minimized, which is defined as\cite{hausler_interaction-assisted_2021}
\begin{equation} 
  R=\sum_i{\left[ \left( \frac{\Delta P\left( z_i \right) -\Delta P_i}{\bar{P}} \right) ^2+\left( \frac{\Delta T\left( z_i \right) -\Delta T_i}{\bar{T}} \right) ^2 \right]}.
  \label{equ:RES}
\end{equation}
Here, $\Delta P\left( z_i \right)$ and $\Delta T\left( z_i \right)$ are obtained from Eqs.~(\ref{equ:6}) and (\ref{equ:7}) at position $z_i$, $\Delta P_i$ and $\Delta T_i$ are the numerically calculated results from Eq.~(\ref{equ:DNES}) at $z_i$, and $\bar{P}$ and $\bar{T}$ are averages of $\Delta P_i$ and $\Delta T_i$.
%
Since the calculation is in the linear response regime, our results are only related to the equilibrium temperature and chemical potential of the system, independent of the initial biases $\Delta P_0$ and $\Delta T_0$. This is checked in Fig.~\ref{fig:test} where evolution from two sets of different initial conditions is fitted by the same set of transport coefficients. 
%Therefore, while ensuring the same average temperature and chemical potential, \revision{we set: (1). the temperature-driven case with $\Delta \mu _0=0$; (2). the chemical-potential-driven case with $\Delta T_0=0$, and the initial deviation and the fitting parameters of Fig.~\ref{fig:2} are substituted into Eqs.~(\ref{equ:6}) and (\ref{equ:7}) to verify the correctness of the results.
%The results in Fig.~\ref{fig:test} show that the evolution curve fits well with the calculated results, indicating the correctness of the fitting method.}


\subsection{Convergence tests} \label{B}
We performed convergence tests for symmetric junctions formed by square and hexagonal honeycomb lattices, respectively, to ensure that the fitted transport coefficients do not depend on the size of the reservoirs. 
The results are summarized in Fig.~(\ref{fig:test}).
%We \revision{choose $\left( -1.06,7 \right) $ as the representative point} in the parameter space shown in Fig.~(\ref{fig:1b}) for the calculation, with nonlinear parameter $\chi =0.2$.
%The results are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:test_S} and \ref{fig:test_H}. 
Parameters used in the main text are enclosed by dotted boxes.


\section{Landauer transport theory}
\label{sec:lt}
\setcounter{figure}{0} 
The DNSE corresponds to an effective tight-binding Hamiltonian for the junction\cite{wu_thermodynamic_2019,rasmussen_statistical_2000}
%Total Hamiltonian of the system contains a linear part $H_L$ and a nonlinear part $H_{NL}$, written as\cite{wu_thermodynamic_2019,rasmussen_statistical_2000}
\begin{equation} 
  H\left( \psi _m,i\psi _{m}^{*} \right) =\sum_{\{m,n\}}{\kappa \psi _{m}^{*}\psi _n}+\frac{1}{2}\chi \sum_m {\left| \psi _m \right|^4}.
      \label{equ:H}
\end{equation}
Here, $\psi _{m}$ and $i\psi _{m}^{*}$ form the canonical conjugate pairs,  $\{m,n\}$ are nearest neighbour pairs. The first and the second term corresponds to the linear and nonlinear part of the Hamiltonian.

We can also analyze the transport coefficients of the junction in the grand canonical ensemble using the Landauer formalism. For this purpose, 
we introduce two fictitious baths coupling to the boundary sites of the two reservoirs, respectively. 
The linear transport coefficients $G$, $\alpha _c$ and $G_T$ of the junction are given by the following integrals

\begin{equation}
  K_n=\int_{\varepsilon _{\min}}^{\varepsilon _{\max}}{\frac{d\varepsilon}{2\pi}\left( \varepsilon -\mu \right) ^n\mT \left( \varepsilon \right) \left( -\frac{\partial f}{\partial \varepsilon} \right)}
  \label{equ:13}
\end{equation}
where $f=T/\left( \varepsilon-\mu \right)$ is the R-J distribution function and $\mT \left( \varepsilon \right)$ is the energy-dependent transmission coefficient, a central quantity in the Landauer formalism.
It is given by the Caroli formula from the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method as
\begin{equation} 
  \mT \left( \varepsilon \right) =\text{Tr}\left[ G_{d}^{\dag}\left( \varepsilon \right) \Gamma _L\left( \varepsilon \right) G_d\left( \varepsilon \right) \Gamma _R\left( \varepsilon \right) \right] 
  \label{equ:14}
\end{equation}
where $G_d=1/\left[ \left( E+i\eta \right) I-H-\Sigma _L-\Sigma _R \right] $ and $G_d^\dagger$ are the retarded and advanced Green's functions of the system, respectively.
$\eta$ is a small positive quantity,
$\Sigma _\alpha \left( \varepsilon \right)$ is the retarded self-energy due to coupling to bath $\alpha$, and $\Gamma _\alpha\left( \varepsilon \right) =-2\text{Im}\left[ \Sigma _\alpha\left( \varepsilon \right) \right]$ is the corresponding broadening function.
Under the wide band approximation, $\Sigma _\alpha$ can be regarded as an energy-independent constant, $\Sigma _\alpha=-i\gamma $, and $\gamma$ is a real parameter, which we choose as $\gamma = 0.1$.
The power and thermal current are written respectively as
\begin{align}
\label{eq:jp}
    J_P &= \int_0^{+\infty}d\varepsilon \mathcal{T}(\varepsilon) (f_L(\varepsilon)-f_R(\varepsilon)),\\
    J_Q &= \int_0^{+\infty}d\varepsilon (\varepsilon-\mu) \mathcal{T}(\varepsilon) (f_L(\varepsilon)-f_R(\varepsilon)).
\label{eq:jq}
\end{align}
The density of states (DOS) of the system is obtained by 
$\rho \left( \varepsilon \right) =i\text{Tr}\left( G_d-G_{d}^{\dag} \right) /M$.
Figure~\ref{fig:3t} shows the transmission spectra and DOS of the two symmetric junctions, from which the transport coefficients of the systems can be calculated and analyzed.
