\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We introduced algorithms to compute doubly regularized entropic
Wasserstein barycenters and studied their computational complexity, both in the
fixed-support and in the free-support settings. Although a naive adaptation of
the usual alternate maximization scheme from~\cite{benamou2015iterative} to our
setting leads to diverging iterates (at least for small values of $\tau$), our
analysis shows that it is sufficient to damp these iterations to get a
converging algorithm.

While we have focused on the problem of barycenters of measures, we note that
the idea of entropic regularization is pervasive in other applications of
optimal transport. There, the flexibility offered by the double entropic
regularization may prove to be useful as well, and we believe that our damped
algorithm could be adapted to these more general settings.
