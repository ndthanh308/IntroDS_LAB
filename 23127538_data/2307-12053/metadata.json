  "abstract": "Let $p\\ge5$ be a prime number. Let $E/\\mathbb{Q}$ be an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by an imaginary quadratic field $K$ such that $p$ is inert in $K$ and that $E$ has good reduction at $p$. Let $K_\\infty$ be the anticyclotomic $\\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $K$. Agboola--Howard defined Kobayashi-type signed Selmer groups of $E$ over $K_\\infty$ and showed that exactly one of them is cotorsion over the corresponding Iwasawa algebra. In this short note, we discuss a link between the characteristic ideals of the cotorsion signed Selmer group and the fine Selmer group building on a recent breakthrough of Burungale--Kobayashi--Ota on the structure of local points.",
