  % With the proliferation of mobile devices, mobile camera systems have become increasingly sophisticated, offering improved image quality. However, scattering and reflective flare continue to pose challenges, particularly in the context of mobile photography. While recent efforts have proposed various solutions for flare removal, the absence of a comprehensive real image dataset, particularly for mobile phones, hinders the progress of effective flare mitigation techniques. This paper aims to bridge this gap by introducing a novel raw image dataset tailored for mobile camera systems, focusing on the flare removal problem. By exploiting the distinct properties of raw images, our dataset serves as a robust platform for developing cutting-edge flare removal algorithms. The dataset encompasses a wide range of real-world scenarios captured using different mobile devices and camera settings, providing more than $2,000$ high-quality full-resolution raw image pairs for scattering flare, and $1,200$ for reflective flare, which can be cropped up to $30,000$ paired patches and $2,200$ paired patches, respectively. Such a diversity ensures generalizability across various imaging conditions. Experiments show that the network trained with synthesized data cannot work well on our dataset. In addition, data processed by the internal ISP of cell phones damages image quaility and using a raw image data provides advantage on the flare removal problem.  Our dataset is expected to drive further research in flare removal and contribute to substantial enhancements in mobile image quality, ultimately benefiting mobile photographers and end-users alike. 
%   The widespread use of mobile devices has led to significant advancements in mobile camera systems, resulting in enhanced image quality. However, mobile photography continues to face challenges with scattering and reflective flare. Despite various proposed solutions for flare removal, the lack of a comprehensive real image dataset tailored for mobile phones impedes the development of effective flare mitigation techniques. This paper addresses this issue by presenting a novel raw image dataset specifically designed for mobile camera systems, concentrating on the flare removal problem.
% Leveraging the unique properties of raw images, our dataset provides a robust foundation for creating cutting-edge flare removal algorithms. It comprises a diverse range of real-world scenarios captured using various mobile devices and camera settings, including over 2,000 high-quality full-resolution raw image pairs for scattering flare, and 1,200 for reflective flare. These images can be further divided into up to 30,000 paired patches and 2,200 paired patches, respectively, ensuring generalizability across different imaging conditions.
% Experimental results reveal that networks trained with synthesized data failed in dealing with complicated light settings in our real image dataset. Furthermore, we demonstrate that processing data through a mobile phone's internal ISP degrades image quality, whereas utilizing raw image data offers advantages in addressing the flare removal problem. Our dataset is anticipated to propel further research in flare removal, leading to substantial improvements in mobile image quality for the benefit of mobile photographers and end-users alike.

% Capitalizing on the distinct properties of raw images, this dataset serves as a solid foundation for developing advanced flare removal algorithms. It encompasses a wide variety of real-world scenarios captured with diverse mobile devices and camera settings. The dataset comprises over 2,000 high-quality full-resolution raw image pairs for scattering flare and 1,100 for reflective flare, which can be further segmented into up to 30,000 and 2,200 paired patches, respectively, ensuring broad adaptability across various imaging conditions.
% Experimental results demonstrate that networks trained with synthesized data struggle to cope with complex lighting settings present in this real image dataset. We also show that processing data through a mobile phone's internal ISP compromises image quality, while using raw image data presents significant advantages for addressing the flare removal problem. Our dataset is expected to enable a array of new research in flare removal and contribute to substantial improvements in mobile image quality, benefiting mobile photographers and end-users alike.
