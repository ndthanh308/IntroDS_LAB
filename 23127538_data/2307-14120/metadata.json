  "abstract": "A simple graph on $n$ vertices may contain a lot of maximum cliques. But how many can it potentially contain? We will define prime and composite graphs, and we will show that if $n \\ge 15$, then the grpahs with the maximum number of maximum cliques have to be composite. Moreover, we will show an edge bound from which we will prove that if any factor of a composite graph has $ω(G_i) \\ge 5$, then it cannot have the maximum number of maximum cliques. Using this we will show that the graph that contains $3^{\\lfloor n/3 \\rfloor}c$ maximum cliques has the most number of maximum cliques on $n$ vertices, where $c\\in\\{1,\\frac{4}{3},2\\}$, depending on $n \\text{ mod } 3$.",

  "comment": "The proof of Theorem 10 is incorrect. A counterexample for which it does not hold is E3^5 U K1. This is a prime graph as its complement is connected, so m=1. However it has 243 maximum cliques while only having 105 edges, so the left side is definitely not smaller than the right side. This makes all subsequent Theorems false",
