  "abstract": "I describe parts of my joint work with S. Deser [March 19, 1931 - April 21, 2023] which started when I was working as a post-doc at Brandeis University in 2001. Our work was mostly, but not exclusively, on conserved charges of higher curvature theories of gravity. I also describe some recent developments, such as expressing the conserved charges in terms of the linearized Riemann tensor; I expound upon the computations. I also reminisce about our interaction for over two decades that went beyond our scientific collaboration. The physics part of this review is intended for graduate students and researchers interested in extended theories of gravity, especially about the conserved quantities and perturbative techniques in these theories.",
