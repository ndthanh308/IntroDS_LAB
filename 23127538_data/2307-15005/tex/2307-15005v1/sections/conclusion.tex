We describe the limitations of the existing point cloud compression methods for enabling LiDAR online perception on the edge.
We propose a lightweight, low-latency, and efficient compression method by using RI and dictionary coding.
For achieving the requirements, FLiCR fully leverages lossy RIs with quantization and subsampling.
To quantify the quality loss by quantization and subsampling, we introduce a new metric, ePSNR, which reflects both the point-wise and entropy-wise qualities of a point cloud.
We evaluate our compression method and demonstrate FLiCR is more appropriate for edge-assisted LiDAR online perceptions than the state-of-the-art compression algorithms.
Compared to the existing algorithm most suitable for the target use case, FLiCR takes up to 80 percent less end-to-end latency while presenting 12\mul compression ratio.
Our evaluation results with 3D object detection and LOAM show the impact of lossy RIs on the downstream perceptions and the effectiveness of ePSNR compared to the current quality metrics to capture this impact.
