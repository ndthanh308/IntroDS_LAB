@inproceedings{conan14,
	abstract = {Object-Oriented Matlab Adaptive Optics (OOMAO) is a Matlab toolbox
	dedicated to Adaptive Optics (AO) systems. OOMAO is based on a small
	set of classes representing the source, atmosphere, telescope, wavefront
	sensor, Deformable Mirror (DM) and an imager of an AO system. This
	simple set of classes allows simulating Natural Guide Star (NGS)
	and Laser Guide Star (LGS) Single Conjugate AO (SCAO) and tomography
	AO systems on telescopes up to the size of the Extremely Large Telescopes
	(ELT). The discrete phase screens that make the atmosphere model
	can be of infinite size, useful for modeling system performance on
	large time scales. OOMAO comes with its own parametric influence
	function model to emulate different types of DMs. The cone effect,
	altitude thickness and intensity profile of LGSs are also reproduced.
	Both modal and zonal modeling approach are implemented. OOMAO has
	also an extensive library of theoretical expressions to evaluate
	the statistical properties of turbulence wavefronts. The main design
	characteristics of the OOMAO toolbox are object-oriented modularity,
	vectorized code and transparent parallel computing. OOMAO has been
	used to simulate and to design the Multi-Object AO prototype Raven
	at the Subaru telescope and the Laser Tomography AO system of the
	Giant Magellan Telescope. In this paper, a Laser Tomography AO system
	on an ELT is simulated with OOMAO. In the first part, we set-up the
	class parameters and we link the instantiated objects to create the
	source optical path. Then we build the tomographic reconstructor
	and write the script for the pseudo-open-loop controller.},

The final outcome of the study is to investigate the opportunity to implement an automatic system for the forecast of these parameters at these sites. In this paper, we present results related to the meso-nh model ability in reconstructing the vertical stratification of the atmospheric parameters along 20 km above the ground. The very satisfactory performances shown by the model in reconstructing most of these parameters (and, in particular, the wind speed) make this tool of investigation the most suitable to be used in astronomical observatories to support Adaptive Optics facilities and to calculate the temporal evolution of the wind speed and the wavefront coherence time at whatever temporal sampling. A further great advantage of this solution is that such estimates can be available in advance (of the order of some hours) with respect to the time of interest.}",

It is shown that the slope measurement sampling geometry influences the model selection for the phase estimation. Successive over-relaxation (SOR) is employed to numerically solve the exact zonal phase estimation problem. A new zonal phase gradient model is introduced and its error propagator, which relates the mean-square wave-front error to the noisy slope measurements, has been compared with two previously used models. A technique for the rapid extraction of phase aperture functions is presented. Error propagation properties for modal estimation are evaluated and compared with zonal estimation results.},

The method is based on the reconstruction of open-loop data from deformable mirror voltages and residual wavefront sensor slopes obtained in closed loop. This dedicated tool implemented in the real time computer of the NAOS (Nasmyth adaptive optics system) system (first AO of the very large telescope) allows us without any loop opening to automatically monitor and display (every 15 s) both the atmospheric conditions and the system performance. We have validated the algorithm and tested its robustness on simulated and experimental data (both in the laboratory and on sky). Using data obtained over more than one year (from January 2002 to June 2003), a statistical study on NAOS performance and turbulence characteristics is proposed.}

% Reconstruction PSF from AO telemetry data

abstract = {Modern Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes (GSMTs) like the Extremely Large Telescope currently under construction depend heavily on Adaptive Optics (AO) systems to correct for atmospheric turbulence. To be able to correct wider fields of view (FoV), Multi-Conjugate Adaptive Optics (MCAO) systems were introduced, which use multiple guide stars to obtain an almost uniform correction over the FoV. However, a residual blur remains in the astronomical images due to tomographic, fitting and bandwidth errors. This results in a blur, which can mathematically be described by a convolution of the true image with a point spread function (PSF). Due to the nature of the turbulent atmosphere and its correction, the PSF is spatially varying. The PSF serves as a quality measure for the science images and therefore needs to be known as accurately as possible. In this paper, we present an algorithm for MCAO PSF reconstruction adapted to the needs of GSMTs focused on estimating the contribution of the tomographic and generalized fitting error to the PSF. In particular, the PSF reconstruction algorithm for Single Conjugate Adaptive Optics by Wagner et al., (2018) is combined with an algorithm for atmospheric tomography by Saxenhuber and Ramlau, (2016) to obtain a direction dependent reconstruction of the post-AO PSF. Results obtained in an end-to-end simulation tool show a qualitatively good reconstruction of the PSF compared to the PSF calculated directly from the simulated incoming wavefront.}

@article{Fried1965,
   abstract = {A precise statistical definition is established for the geometric “shape” of a randomly distorted wavefront. Relationships between the phase-structure function and the statistics governing the shape are derived. The most significant portion of wavefront distortion caused by atmospheric turbulence is a random tilting of the plane-wave front. A procedure is outlined for calculating the influence of wavefront distortion on optical systems. Estimates are formed of the effect of wave-front distortion on photographic resolution and optical heterodyne efficiency.},
