  "abstract": "The tableau reconstruction problem, posed by Monks (2009), asks the following. Starting with a standard Young tableau $T$, a 1-minor of $T$ is a tableau obtained by first deleting any cell of $T$, and then performing jeu de taquin slides to fill the resulting gap. This can be iterated to arrive at the set of $k$-minors of $T$. The problem is this: given $k$, what are the values of $n$ such that every tableau of size $n$ can be reconstructed from its set of $k$-minors? For $k=1$, the problem was recently solved by Cain and Lehtonen. In this paper, we solve the problem for $k=2$, proving the sharp lower bound $n \\geq 8$. In the case of multisets of $k$-minors, we also give a lower bound for arbitrary $k$, as a first step toward a sharp bound in the general multiset case.",
