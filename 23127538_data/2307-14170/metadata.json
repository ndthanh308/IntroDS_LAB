  "abstract": "The concept of power among players can be expressed as a combination of their utilities. A player who obeys another takes into account the utility of the dominant one. Technically it is a matter of superimposing some weighted sum or product function onto the individual utility function, where the weights can be represented through directed graphs that reflect a situation of power among the players. It is then possible to define some global indices of the system, such as the level of hierarchy, mutualism and freedom, and measure their effects on game equilibria.",
