abstract="A statistical framework that can be used for analysis of statewide traffic count data is described. A basis for designing a streamlined and cost-effective statewide traffic data collection program is also provided. The procedures described were developed as part of an in-depth evaluation study for the Washington State Department of Transportation. They were used to develop recommendations for an improved, statistically based, statewide highway data collection program. The program is intended to be implemented readily and is consistent with the FHWA Highway Performance Monitoring System and the recent FHWA draft Traffic Monitoring Guide. Several modifications (improvements) to the statistical framework of the latter for volume counting and vehicle classification were investigated, particularly methods of deriving estimates of annual average daily traffic (AADT) from short-duration axle counts at any location on the state highway system. AADT estimates can be derived for each vehicle type, if desired. The estimation of associated seasonal, axle correction, and growth factors is also described. The methodology enables the statistical precision of all estimates to be determined. The results obtained from applying these procedures to Washington State traffic data are presented.

abstract = {We examined whether highway traffic volume changed the rates of movement (habitat permeability) for ten mammalian species in the central Canadian Rocky Mountains. Winter track count data were collected on four highways of varying traffic volume: the Trans-Canada Highway (TCH) (14,000 annual average daily traffic [AADT]) and 1A Highway (3,000 AADT) in Banff National Park and the Highway 40 (5,000 AADT) and Smith Dorrien Trail in Kananaskis Country (2,000 AADT). Permeability represented the ratio of road crossing tracks/km to tracks/km on transects adjacent to roads. We compared permeability at the community level and for carnivore and ungulate guilds, using a Kruskal–Wallis H-test. Traffic volume significantly reduced habitat permeability for the community ( P < 0.05). Pair-wise Kruskal–Wallis tests showed that habitat permeability was significantly reduced for carnivores at high traffic volume ( P = 0.008) and for ungulates at very high traffic volume ( P < 0.043). Cross-referencing with winter traffic counts, we found movement was impaired for carnivores when traffic ranged from 300 to 500 vehicles per day (VPD) and for ungulates between 500 and 5,000 VPD. Our results indicated that the TCH requires mitigation to restore habitat permeability for all species and yielded strong evidence that the Highway 40 is a priority for mitigation.},

pages={1011-1032},
abstract={A promising methodology is proposed to estimate reliable annual average daily traffic (AADT) volumes for no-surveyed road sections using probe volumes collected by a vehicle global positioning system (GPS). This research was inspired by the obvious concept that probe counts are a direct portion of AADT from the viewpoint of vehicle trip behavior. The method converts the probe volume of target road section to AADT using the nonlinear relationship between geographical neighborhoods composed of observed AADT volumes and annual average daily probe volumes. The relationship is determined with a locally weighted power-curve model. A feasibility of the proposed method was demonstrated through a case study using real-world data. Analysis results show that the proposed method is a practical and cost-effective way to estimate reliable AADT for unmeasured road segments. This indicates that there exists a strong relationship between AADT values and vehicle-GPS probe values from the trip characteristics of a road network.},

abstract={For this validation study, NREL compiled traffic volume data from permanent traffic counters at over 500 locations across the U.S. These data were used to validate annual average daily traffic (AADT) estimates developed by Streetlight Data using passive data sources. The analysis revealed a strong correlation between estimates derived from passive sources and the permanent counters. However, statistical differences were observed, and deviations from ground truth may be unacceptable for some applications. Toll locations were particularly prone to high errors, possibly due to complex geometry. While the validation sheds light on the utility of AADT estimation from passive sources, its findings were limited by a lack of permanent counter data. It is possible that an analysis using a larger sample size could result in more robust findings.},

abstract = {Recent advances in global positioning systems (GPS) technology have resulted in a transition in household travel survey methods to test the use of GPS units to record travel details, followed by the application of an algorithm to both identify trips and impute trip purpose, typically supplemented with some level of respondent confirmation via prompted-recall surveys. As the research community evaluates this new approach to potentially replace the traditional survey-reported collection method, it is important to consider how well the GPS-recorded and algorithm-imputed details capture trip details and whether the traditional survey-reported collection method may be preferred with regards to some types of travel. This paper considers two measures of travel intensity (survey-reported and GPS-recorded) for two trip purposes (work and non-work) as dependent variables in a joint ordered response model. The empirical analysis uses a sample from the full-study of the 2009 Indianapolis regional household travel survey. Individuals in this sample provided diary details about their travel survey day as well as carried wearable GPS units for the same 24-h period. The empirical results provide important insights regarding differences in measures of travel intensities related to the two different data collection modes (diary and GPS). The results suggest that more research is needed in the development of workplace identification algorithms, that GPS should continue to be used alongside rather than in lieu of the traditional diary approach, and that assignment of individuals to the GPS or diary survey approach should consider demographics and other characteristics.},
