abstract="A statistical framework that can be used for analysis of statewide traffic count data is described. A basis for designing a streamlined and cost-effective statewide traffic data collection program is also provided. The procedures described were developed as part of an in-depth evaluation study for the Washington State Department of Transportation. They were used to develop recommendations for an improved, statistically based, statewide highway data collection program. The program is intended to be implemented readily and is consistent with the FHWA Highway Performance Monitoring System and the recent FHWA draft Traffic Monitoring Guide. Several modifications (improvements) to the statistical framework of the latter for volume counting and vehicle classification were investigated, particularly methods of deriving estimates of annual average daily traffic (AADT) from short-duration axle counts at any location on the state highway system. AADT estimates can be derived for each vehicle type, if desired. The estimation of associated seasonal, axle correction, and growth factors is also described. The methodology enables the statistical precision of all estimates to be determined. The results obtained from applying these procedures to Washington State traffic data are presented.

abstract = {We examined whether highway traffic volume changed the rates of movement (habitat permeability) for ten mammalian species in the central Canadian Rocky Mountains. Winter track count data were collected on four highways of varying traffic volume: the Trans-Canada Highway (TCH) (14,000 annual average daily traffic [AADT]) and 1A Highway (3,000 AADT) in Banff National Park and the Highway 40 (5,000 AADT) and Smith Dorrien Trail in Kananaskis Country (2,000 AADT). Permeability represented the ratio of road crossing tracks/km to tracks/km on transects adjacent to roads. We compared permeability at the community level and for carnivore and ungulate guilds, using a Kruskal–Wallis H-test. Traffic volume significantly reduced habitat permeability for the community ( P < 0.05). Pair-wise Kruskal–Wallis tests showed that habitat permeability was significantly reduced for carnivores at high traffic volume ( P = 0.008) and for ungulates at very high traffic volume ( P < 0.043). Cross-referencing with winter traffic counts, we found movement was impaired for carnivores when traffic ranged from 300 to 500 vehicles per day (VPD) and for ungulates between 500 and 5,000 VPD. Our results indicated that the TCH requires mitigation to restore habitat permeability for all species and yielded strong evidence that the Highway 40 is a priority for mitigation.},

Such measurement errors (ME) can attenuate the respective predictors’ effect and also increase dispersion. This paper proposes an approach which involves the use of a ME model based on traffic flow time series data. The model is used in conjunction with the negative binomial SPF to circumvent the bias in predicting the aggregate number of accidents during the time period under study. The proposed approach (denoted by MENB), was compared with the traditional negative binomial (NB) technique by way of Monte Carlo simulation. Furthermore, both approaches were applied to two datasets corresponding to 131 and 130 road segments in British Columbia. The full Bayes method was utilized for parameter estimation, performance evaluation and inference through the use of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques. The simulation results showed that MENB has outperformed NB when large measurement errors are present. The goodness-of-fit statistics showed that MENB has provided a slightly better fit to the data. However, in the presence of measurement errors, the NB has underestimated the predicted number of accidents for heavy traffic on long road segments and vice versa. The use of MENB is justified when the variance in volume between years is large otherwise both approaches yield comparable results.},

AADT is typically estimated from short-term counts and contains error which can negatively affect NS outcomes and result in the inefficient allocation of safety improvement resources. In this paper, we propose a simulation-based method for quantifying the monetary benefit of improving AADT accuracy. The results of applying the method under various conditions show that crash data sets with higher sample mean and dispersion parameter values are more sensitive to AADT error and consequently benefit more from improving AADT accuracy. The use of the proposed method is illustrated through the application to a real-world example.},

Both universal kriging and geographically weighted regression (GWR) are found to reduce errors (in practically and statistically significant ways) over non-spatial regression techniques, though errors remain quite high at some sites, particularly those with low counts and/or in less measurement-dense areas. Nearly all tests indicated that the predictive capabilities of kriging exceed those of GWR by average absolute errors of 3–8\%. Interestingly, the estimation of kriging parameters by network distances show no enhanced performance over Euclidean distances, which require less data and are much more easily computed.},

The AADT estimates derived from permanent or portable counts are critical to roadway planning, system operations, and distribution of funding. The AASHTO AADT estimation formula is the most commonly used method, in part because it can be used under many circumstances when hourly traffic volume observations are missing, which is a common measurement issue with permanent traffic-counting sites. Despite its utility, the AASHTO AADT method has limitations in that it requires complete hourly data for any day that is included, and it does not account for variations in the numbers of each day of the week within a month or variations in the number of days within a month. This research evaluated new AADT estimation methods that incorporate days in which some, but not all, hourly observations are available and adjusts volume for the number of times each day of the week occurs in a month and the number of days per month. The bias and precision of four methods were examined for AADT estimation from hundreds of permanent traffic-counting sites. The analysis used more than 48 million records from the FHWA Travel Monitoring Analysis System, covering 14 years (2000 through 2013). This research quantified the improvement in accuracy and precision of the new methods, which effectively allow for a greater proportion of data to be retained in the estimation formula. },

abstract = {Traffic volume is an important parameter in most transportation planning applications. Low volume roads make up about 69\% of road miles in the United States. Estimating traffic on the low volume roads is a cost-effective alternative to taking traffic counts. This is because traditional traffic counts are expensive and impractical for low priority roads. The purpose of this paper is to present the development of two alternative means of cost-effectively estimating traffic volumes for low volume roads in Wyoming and to make recommendations for their implementation. The study methodology involves reviewing existing studies, identifying data sources, and carrying out the model development. The utility of the models developed were then verified by comparing actual traffic volumes to those predicted by the model. The study resulted in two regression models that are inexpensive and easy to implement. The first regression model was a linear regression model that utilized pavement type, access to highways, predominant land use types, and population to estimate traffic volume. In verifying the model, an R2 value of 0.64 and a root mean square error of 73.4\% were obtained. The second model was a logistic regression model that identified the level of traffic on roads using five thresholds or levels. The logistic regression model was verified by estimating traffic volume thresholds and determining the percentage of roads that were accurately classified as belonging to the given thresholds. For the five thresholds, the percentage of roads classified correctly ranged from 79\% to 88\%. In conclusion, the verification of the models indicated both model types to be useful for accurate and cost-effective estimation of traffic volumes for low volume Wyoming roads. The models developed were recommended for use in traffic volume estimations for low volume roads in pavement management and environmental impact assessment studies.},

Traditional ordinary least square (OLS) regression and geographically weighted regression (GWR) methods were explored to estimate AADT on local roads. Ten spatially distributed counties were considered for county-level analysis and modeling. The results indicate that road density, AADT at the nearest nonlocal road, and land use variables have a significant influence on local road AADT. The GWR model is found to be better at estimating the AADT than the OLS regression model. The developed county-level models were used for estimating AADT at non-covered locations in each county. The methodology, findings, and the AADT estimates at non-covered locations can be used to plan, design, build, and maintain the local roads in addition to meeting reporting requirements. The prediction error is found to be higher at urban areas and in counties with a smaller number of local road traffic count stations. Recommendations are made to account for influencing factors and enhance the local road count-based AADT sampling methodology.},

This research was inspired by the obvious concept that probe counts are a direct portion of AADT from the viewpoint of vehicle trip behavior. The method converts the probe volume of target road section to AADT using the nonlinear relationship between geographical neighborhoods composed of observed AADT volumes and annual average daily probe volumes. The relationship is determined with a locally weighted power-curve model. A feasibility of the proposed method was demonstrated through a case study using real-world data. Analysis results show that the proposed method is a practical and cost-effective way to estimate reliable AADT for unmeasured road segments. This indicates that there exists a strong relationship between AADT values and vehicle-GPS probe values from the trip characteristics of a road network.},

The analysis revealed a strong correlation between estimates derived from passive sources and the permanent counters. However, statistical differences were observed, and deviations from ground truth may be unacceptable for some applications. Toll locations were particularly prone to high errors, possibly due to complex geometry. While the validation sheds light on the utility of AADT estimation from passive sources, its findings were limited by a lack of permanent counter data.

abstract={Big data analytics is being used to generate traffic data that may be used by an agency to supplement its routine data collection. StreetLight InSight ® and Streetlytics, produced by StreetLight Data and Bentley Systems respectively, are two such tools that promise to provide traffic volumes, including AADTs, for every roadway in the US. This study collected ground truth data from continuous counters from 14 permanent stations (AADT), full- month traffic volumes from 30 locations, and 24-hour daily volumes from 60 locations and compared against corresponding data from StreetLight and Streetlytics. The five measures used are accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, and accessibility of the estimating data from the two tools. While the assessments done for timeliness and accessibility were for information purposes, scores were generated for accuracy, completeness, and validity. The primary accuracy metric used was mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) but secondary metrics, comprising percent root mean square error ({\%}RMSE) and median/maximum absolute percentage error were also generated to provide more insights on the validation effort. MAPE results for the permanent stations showed StreetLight outperforming Streetlytics. However, MAPE results for both the full-month and 24-hour locations showed Streetlytics outperforming StreetLight. Furthermore, when considering only low-volume roadways of less than 500 vpd, Streetlytics outperformed StreetLight for locations with volumes under 300 vpd while StreetLight generally outperformed Streetlytics for locations with volumes over 300 vpd. However, data from both tools were determined to be valid for use for traffic assessments. Due to the favorable results obtained for both tools, a hands-on demonstration of each tool has been recommended to allow potential users to evaluate the user-friendliness of the individual interfaces as well as the ease of use of the various tools on each platform.},

abstract={Traditional traffic counts have long been utilized by U.S. DOT, the states, and MPOs to determine volumes of traffic. Recent developments in connected technologies have provided the potential for probe-based, or passive, measurement of traffic volumes that combines information on specific vehicles and advanced analytics algorithms to estimate AADT (Annual Average Daily Traffic). This task considers data provided from an evaluation of one such passive measurement system that produced AADT estimates from both the passive method and the traditional counts in 2019 for a sample of more than 800 roadways over 29 states, including a wide range of functional classifications and volumes. A statistical analysis was performed to determine if the data collected provided evidence that the mean (and median) AADT as determined by the passive method would be expected to be systematically different (higher or lower) than that of AADT based on traditional counts. Mean difference was evaluated through paired sample t-tests of base-10 logarithmically transformed AADT values, while median differences were evaluated through the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Overall, there was adequate evidence to reject the assumption of equality and instead conclude that the passive measurement mean (or median) AADT exceeded that of the traditional counts with at least 95{\%} confidence [geometric mean difference estimated at 6.6 percent (p-value <0.001) / median difference estimated at 3.9 percent (p-value <0.001)]. More detailed comparisons were conducted by urban/rural status, functional classifications, and AADT volume ranges. For these comparisons, the statistical test results were adjusted for multiple comparisons to control the risk of erroneously concluding significant differences to no more than 5 percent. In this context, urban and rural, broad volume ranges (<5000, 5,000-50,000, and 50,000+), and especially toll roads provided strong evidence for higher values in the passive measurement. The comparisons by roadway Functional Class 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5, and for most smaller volume ranges (e.g., AADT range of 5,000), failed to reject the assumption of equal means (medians). The lack of significance for the smaller groups could be related to lower statistical power with fewer samples in each comparison. The overall significant difference between passive and traditional estimates was influenced by the very large observed difference for toll roads.},

abstract={This report summarizes an extensive review of academic and professional research making use of third-party data products available to transportation agencies. In particular, the review focused on studies conducted with Bluetooth receivers, Global Positioning System (GPS) devices, and mobile device data (MDD) obtained through cellular networks and location-based services embedded in smartphone applications. The review considers the specific applications of the data products seen within the literature, the sample size reported or inferred within the reviewed studies, and summarizes success or failure of the attempted applications. The review also contains a summary of the underlying technologies, including inferred and known sources of bias or incompleteness. The recommendations of this report are based on the previously described review of the literature as well as personal interviews with prominent researchers identified in the review. The central finding of the report is that entirely replacing legacy data collection methods is not likely to result in the best outcomes for UDOT or other agencies. Rather, passive data products can be most useful to agencies that use them as a supplement to existing and ongoing data collection efforts.},

This report evaluates the technical and statistical validity of traffic data derived from these sources using machine learning methods. Validity was determined by comparison to 4255 permanent counters, and a survey of recent publications about accuracy expectations. The document covers the input data and the development of the machine learning models and model validation. The results include the error by road volume, roadway and regional characteristics compared to typical estimation. The effects of reduced trip sample, ping rate, spatial accuracy and reference counters were also tested. The applicability of Probe Data was tested for other factors including, day of week, month of year, directional and ramp AADT, work zones ADT, K and D factors, peak hour truck data, special events or unusual weather and AADT by vehicle type.},

keywords={Annual average daily traffic; Probes (Measuring devices); Data collection; Traffic data},
abstract={This report documents an independent evaluation of annual average daily traffic (AADT) estimates developed from traffic probes by StreetLight Data, Inc (StL). The Texas A{\&}M Transportation Institute (TTI) researchers performed a systematic process to identify accurate permanent continuous counter sites maintained by public agencies and private entities that could be used as benchmark sites against which to evaluate these AADT estimates. Ultimately, though, TTI could only use 215 bidirectional (552 directional) continuous count sites owned and maintained by state departments of transportation. TTI researchers used several evaluation measures and several statistical hypothesis tests to assess the accuracy and precision of StreetLight Data's AADT estimates. These multiple evaluation measures and hypothesis tests produced mixed results. Some statistical tests provided contradictory or counterintuitive results while other statistical hypothesis tests indicated that StL's AADT estimates are statistically the same as the benchmark AADT values. TTI used professional judgment to weight and consider each evaluation result, and concluded that StL's AADT estimates are valid for traffic monitoring use on roads with bidirectional AADT of 5,000 or greater vehicles per day. Because the evaluation results were mixed and the validity decision was not clear cut, TTI recommends phased implementation that includes two elements: 1) a one-to-three year transition period (DOTs still collecting short duration counts but comparing to StL AADT estimates) should be used to confirm TTI's professional judgment based on these mixed evaluation results; 2) a pilot implementation program initiated by FHWA that includes up to five early adopter state DOTs, to monitor and coordinate findings in early-adopting states.},

abstract={In this study, the Texas A{\&}M Transportation Institute (TTI) conducted an independent, follow-up evaluation of StreetLight Data's 2019 traffic count estimates using MnDOT sources of traffic count data. At 442 permanent benchmark locations, TTI found that average annual daily traffic ( AADT) estimation accuracy by StreetLight Data has improved significantly since the 2017 evaluation, especially in moderate-to high-volume categories (i.e., more than 10,000 AADT). The mean absolute error ranged from 8{\%} to 10{\%} for locations greater than 10,000 AADT and gradually increased to 42{\%} for sites with less than 1,000 AADT. TTI also found significant overestimation bias for low-volume roadways (i.e., less than 2,500 to 5,000 AADT). This result was present in the permanent benchmark sites and more pronounced in the 265 short-duration count sites. Based on these findings, TTI recommends that MnDOT consider a phased approach to using probe-based traffic count estimates: 1) Continue to maintain MnDOT permanent counter sites; 2) start using probe-based counts for about 90{\%} of the moderate-to high-volume roadways (20,000 or more AADT); 3) continue to use traditional short-duration counts at the remaining 10{\%} of the moderate-to high-volume roadways as a spot check to ensure that probe-based AADT estimates remain within acceptable tolerances in the next five to ten years; 4) periodically monitor the error of AADT estimates on low-to moderate-volume roadways (less than 20,000 AADT); and 5) once acceptable error tolerances for these lower-volume categories are reached, repeat Step 2 for these lower-volume categories.},

abstract={The Virginia Department of Transportation (VDOT) has purchased a subscription to the StreetLight (SL) Data products that mainly offer origin-destination (OD) related metrics through crowdsourcing data. Users can manipulate a data source like this to quickly estimate origin-destination trip tables. Nonetheless, the SL metrics heavily rely on the data points sampled from smartphone applications and global positioning services (GPS) devices, which may be subject to potential bias and coverage issues. In particular, the quality of the SL metrics in relation to meeting the needs of various VDOT work tasks is not clear. Guidelines on the use of the SL metrics are of interest to VDOT. This study aimed to help VDOT understand the performance of the SL metrics in different application contexts. Specifically, existing studies that examined the potential of SL metrics have been reviewed and summarized. In addition, the experiences, comments, and concerns of existing users and potential users have been collected through online surveys. The developed surveys were primarily distributed to VDOT engineers and planners as well as other professionals in planning organizations and consultants in Virginia. Their typical applications of the SL metrics have been identified and feedback has been used to guide and inform the design of the guidelines. To support the development of a set of guidelines, the quality of the SL metrics has been independently evaluated with six testing scenarios covering annual average daily traffic (AADT), origin-destination trips, traffic flow on road links, turning movements at intersections, and truck traffic. The research team has sought ground-truth data from different sources such as continuous count stations, toll transaction data, VDOT's internal traffic estimations, etc. Several methods were used to perform the comparison between the benchmark data and the corresponding SL metrics. The evaluation results were mixed. The latest SL AADT estimates showed relatively small absolute percentage errors, whereas using the SL metrics to estimate OD trips, traffic counts on roadway segments and at intersections, and truck traffic did not show a relatively low and stable error rate. Large percentage errors were often found to be associated with lower volume levels estimated based on the SL metrics. In addition, using the SL metrics from individual periods as the input for estimating these traffic measures resulted in larger errors. Instead, the aggregation of data from multi-periods helped reduce the errors, especially for low volume conditions. Depending on project purposes, the aggregation can be based on metrics of multiple days, weeks, or months. The results from the literature review, surveys, and independent evaluations were synthesized to help develop the guidelines for using SL data products. The guidelines focused on five main aspects: (1) a summary for using SL data for typical planning work tasks; (2) general guidance for data extraction and preparation; (3) using the SL metrics in typical application scenarios; (4) quality issues and calibration of the SL metrics; and (5) techniques and tools for working with the SL metrics. The developed guidelines were accompanied with illustrative examples to allow users to go through the given use cases. Based on the results, the study recommends that VDOT's Transportation and Mobility Planning Division (TMPD) should encourage and support the use of the guidelines in projects involving SL data, and that TMPD should adopt a checklist (table) for reporting performance, calibration efforts, and benchmark data involved in projects that use the SL metrics.},

abstract = {The traffic volume on road segments is a vital property of the transportation efficiency. City-wide traffic volume information can benefit people with their everyday life, and help the government on better city planning. However, there are no existing methods that can monitor the traffic volume of every road, because they are either too expensive or inaccurate. Fortunately, nowadays we can collect a large amount of urban data which provides us the opportunity to tackle this problem. In this paper, we propose a novel framework to infer the city-wide traffic volume information with data collected by loop detectors and taxi trajectories. Although these two data sets are incomplete, sparse and from quite different domains, the proposed spatio-temporal semi-supervised learning model can take the full advantages of both data and accurately infer the volume of each road. In order to provide a better interpretation on the inference results, we also derive the confidence of the inference based on spatio-temporal properties of traffic volume. Real-world data was collected from 155 loop detectors and 6,918 taxis over a period of 17 days in Guiyang China. The experiments performed on this large urban data set demonstrate the advantages of the proposed framework on correctly inferring the traffic volume in a city-wide scale.},

To this end, the paper examines applications of vehicle probe data, automatic traffic recorder counts, and neural network models to estimate hourly volumes in the Maryland highway network, and proposes a novel approach that combines neural networks with an existing profiling method. On average, the proposed approach yields 24\% more accurate estimates than volume profiles, which are currently used by transportation agencies across the US to compute statewide performance measures. The paper also quantifies the value of using vehicle probe data in estimating hourly traffic volumes, which provides important managerial insights to transportation agencies interested in acquiring this type of data. For example, results show that volumes can be estimated with a mean absolute percent error of about 21\% at locations where average number of observed probes is between 30 and 47 vehicles/h, which provides a useful guideline for assessing the value of probe vehicle data from different vendors.},

abstract = { Annual average daily traffic (AADT) is a critical input into many transportation applications, particularly safety reporting. For example, the Highway Safety Improvement Program in the U.S. requires states to make AADT data for all public paved roadways accessible by 2026. Because collecting traffic counts on every network segment is prohibitively expensive, a method capable of accurately estimating AADT on unmonitored segments is of great value to state DOTs. The ubiquitous probe vehicle data present a great opportunity to this end. This paper presents an enhanced method for statewide AADT estimation by leveraging such data in Kentucky. The use of the probe data is explored in two ways. First, an annual average daily probes (AADP) variable is derived from hourly probe counts; second, a betweenness centrality (BC) variable is calculated using probe speeds. Including both variables and using the random forest model results in model performance that exceeds those previously reported for statewide applications. Incorporating AADP and BC improves the accuracy of AADT estimates by 30\%–37\% for all roads and 23\%–43\% for highways in functional classes 5–7, compared with only using sociodemographic and roadway characteristics. These results demonstrate the value of the probe data for enhancing AADT estimation. The analysis further shows that on roadways having more than 53 AADP or an average of 2.2 probe counts per hour, the median and the mean absolute percent errors are below 20\% and 25\%, respectively. These findings have practical implications for state DOTs wanting to maximize the utility of probe vehicle data. },

Data needs for transportation modeling and privacy protection should be deliberately balanced for different applications. This paper focuses on developing privacy mechanisms that would simultaneously satisfy privacy protection and data needs for fine-grained urban traffic modeling applications using mobile sensors. To accomplish this, a virtual trip lines (VTLs) zone-based system and related filtering approaches are developed. Traffic-knowledge-based adversary models are proposed and tested to evaluate the effectiveness of such a privacy protection system by making privacy attacks. The results show that in addition to ensuring an acceptable level of privacy, the released datasets from the privacy-enhancing system can also be applied to urban traffic modeling with satisfactory results. Albeit application-specific, such a “Privacy-by-Design” approach would hopefully shed some light on other transportation applications using mobile sensors.},

abstract = {Speed is one of the most important parameters describing the condition of the traffic flow. Many analytical models related to traffic flow either produce speed as a performance measure, or use speed to determine other measures such as travel time, delay, and the level of service. Mathematical models or distributions used to describe speed characteristics are very useful, especially when they are utilized in the context of simulation and theoretical derivations. Traditionally, normal, log–normal and composite distributions have been the usual mathematical distributions to characterize speed data. These traditional distributions, however, often fail to produce an adequate goodness-of-fit when the empirical distribution of speed data exhibits bimodality (or multimodality), skewness, or excess kurtosis (peakness). This often occurs when the speed data are generated from several different sub-populations, for example, mixed traffic flow conditions or mixed vehicle compositions. The traditional modeling approach also lacks the ability to explain the underlying factors that lead to different speed distribution curves. The objective of this paper is to explore the applicability of the finite mixture of normal (Gaussian) distributions to capture the heterogeneity in vehicle speed data, and thereby explaining the aforementioned special characteristics. For the parameter estimation, Bayesian estimation method via Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling is adopted. The field data collected on IH-35 in Texas is used to evaluate the proposed models. The results of this study show that the finite mixture of normal distributions can very effectively describe the heterogeneous speed data, and provide richer information usually not available from the traditional models. The finite mixture modeling produces an excellent fit to the multimodal speed distribution curve. Moreover, the causes of different speed distributions can be identified through investigating the components.},

	abstract = {The Japanese Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) is a regional satellite navigation system capable of transmitting navigation signals that are compatible and interoperable with other Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). In addition to navigation signals, QZSS also transmits augmentation signals, e.g. the L-band Experimental (LEX) signal. The LEX signal is unique for QZSS in delivering correction messages such as orbits and clock information that enable real-time Precise Point Positioning (PPP). This study aims to evaluate the availability of the LEX signal as well as the quality of the broadcast correction messages for real-time PPP applications. The system is tested in both static and kinematic positioning modes. The results show that the availability of the LEX signal is 60\% when the QZSS satellite elevation is at 30° and above 90\% when the satellite is above 40° elevation. Centimetre-level position accuracy can be obtained for static PPP processing after two hours of convergence using the current MADOCA-LEX (Multi-GNSS Advanced Demonstration of Orbit and Clock Analysis) correction messages transmitted on the LEX signal; and decimetre-level point positioning accuracy can be obtained for kinematic PPP processing.},

This paper presents the results of several vehicle tracking tests comparing smartphone speeds to benchmark values obtained for three types of routes. Benchmark values were obtained using a high frequency calibrated V-Box mounted on the test vehicle with four Android OS smartphone units. A relationship is established linking error in smartphone instantaneous speeds to the corresponding signal Circular Error Probable (CEP) range for different road and traffic conditions. This relationship is used to provide speed adjustment factors for the smartphone probe estimates subject to varying satellite signal strength. The CEP test is a reported GPS unit indicator of precision based on a known ground control benchmark. Smartphone speeds (adjusted and unadjusted) are compared to aggregate speed profiles from a stationary radar detector placed at a given location along SS106 in southern Italy. The smartphone devices were found to replicate closely the observed speed profiles obtained from the fixed detector station. Simple t-tests suggest that the means of the smartphone speeds for the unadjusted case differed significantly from the means obtained from the radar detector, when the smartphone estimates were adjusted for uncertainty (CEP range related), however, the difference in mean speeds between the smartphone probes and the radar detector profile was not found to be statistically significant.},

abstract = {Recent advances in global positioning systems (GPS) technology have resulted in a transition in household travel survey methods to test the use of GPS units to record travel details, followed by the application of an algorithm to both identify trips and impute trip purpose, typically supplemented with some level of respondent confirmation via prompted-recall surveys. As the research community evaluates this new approach to potentially replace the traditional survey-reported collection method, it is important to consider how well the GPS-recorded and algorithm-imputed details capture trip details and whether the traditional survey-reported collection method may be preferred with regards to some types of travel. This paper considers two measures of travel intensity (survey-reported and GPS-recorded) for two trip purposes (work and non-work) as dependent variables in a joint ordered response model. The empirical analysis uses a sample from the full-study of the 2009 Indianapolis regional household travel survey. Individuals in this sample provided diary details about their travel survey day as well as carried wearable GPS units for the same 24-h period. The empirical results provide important insights regarding differences in measures of travel intensities related to the two different data collection modes (diary and GPS). The results suggest that more research is needed in the development of workplace identification algorithms, that GPS should continue to be used alongside rather than in lieu of the traditional diary approach, and that assignment of individuals to the GPS or diary survey approach should consider demographics and other characteristics.},

abstract = { Annual average daily traffic (AADT) is an important measurement used in traffic engineering. Local streets are major components of a road network. However, automatic traffic recorders (ATRs) used to collect AADT are often limited to arterial roads, and such information is, therefore, often unavailable for local streets. Estimating AADT on local streets becomes a necessity as local street traffic continues to grow and the capacity of arterial roads becomes insufficient. A challenge is that an under-represented sample of local street AADT may result in biased estimation. A synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) is applied to oversample local streets to correct the imbalanced sampling among different road types. A generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) is employed to estimate AADT incorporating various independent variables, including factors of roadway design, socio-demographics, and land use. The model is examined with an AADT dataset from Seattle, WA. Results show that: (1) SMOTE helps to correct imbalanced sampling proportions and improve model performance significantly; (2) the number of lanes and the number of crosswalks are both positively associated with AADT; (3) road segments located in areas with a higher population density or more mixed land use have a higher AADT; (4) distance to the nearest arterial road is negatively correlated with AADT; and (5) AADT creates spatial spillover effects on neighboring road segments. The combination of SMOTE and GLMM improves the estimation accuracy on AADT, which contributes to better data for transportation planning and traffic monitoring, and to cost saving on data collection. },

abstract = { The government of Burkina Faso has recently been making important macroeconomic changes to encourage the economic growth of the country. To maintain this growth, the government has implemented a transportation program to improve road network efficiency and safety. A 2000 study to improve the safety of rural roads in Burkina Faso is described. The primary objectives were to assess traffic safety problems and propose countermeasures to reduce the number and severity of collisions on rural roads. Many rural roads were evaluated on site; all accident data and important socioeconomic variables were collected; and key staff members from various governmental and private agencies were interviewed. The study has shown that traffic safety problems in Burkina Faso are multidimensional, involving inefficient traffic safety management and policy, inadequate road networks, untrained drivers, and defective vehicles. Several traffic safety countermeasures have been proposed for immediate, short-, and long-term application. The most important countermeasures are to create a new institutional framework for improving traffic safety management and train the key personnel responsible for implementing these countermeasures. For the short term, the counter-measures mainly relate to roadway infrastructure improvements and better enforcement tools. For the long term, the countermeasures include a review of current highway traffic laws and their application, evaluation of existing countermeasures, and driver training improvement. },

abstract = {Road safety developments are correlated with mobility developments, which are in turn affected by socioeconomic factors (level of motorisation, economic growth etc.). During the last few years, road traffic fatalities exhibit important annual reductions in several developed countries; these reductions cannot be justified by policy efforts alone, and are partly attributed to the global economic recession affecting most countries’ economy and mobility. The present research aims to associate annual Gross Domestic Product (GDP) changes with the related annual changes in road traffic mortality rates. Mortality rates and GDP per capita data for the period 1975–2011 are used from 27 European countries, for the development of mixed linear models. The results suggest that an annual increase of GDP per capita leads to an annual increase of mortality rates, whereas an annual decrease of GDP per capita leads to an annual decrease of mortality rates. These effects are statistically significant overall, and in different groups of countries (Northern/Western, Central/Eastern and Southern). A one-year lagged effect of annual GDP decrease was found to be significant in Northern/Western countries. These effects may capture annual GDP increases from the improvement in the prosperity level of most European countries, as well as occasional annual GDP decreases as a result of socioeconomic events (e.g. economic recessions, political changes in Central/Eastern European countries in the early nineties etc.). The models proposed in this paper are able to characterise the short-term dynamics of the examined variables, but not their long-run relationships.},
