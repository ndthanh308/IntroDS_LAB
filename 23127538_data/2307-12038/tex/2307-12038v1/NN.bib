In particular, the order conditions, as they are now understood, will be outlined, as will the introduction and practical implementation of implicit Runge-Kutta methods, the use of linear and nonlinear stability analysis in the assessment of Runge-Kutta methods, and the theory and applications of the composition of methods. Of the many further developments that have arisen, most are discussed only briefly; however, the recent interest in Runge-Kutta methods for Hamiltonian systems will be surveyed in more detail.}

abstract = {Rationale and objective
We developed a technique that uses a multiple massive-training artificial neural network (multi-MTANN) to reduce the number of false-positive results in a computer-aided diagnostic (CAD) scheme for detecting nodules in chest radiographs.
Materials and methods
Our database consisted of 91 solitary pulmonary nodules, including 64 malignant nodules and 27 benign nodules, in 91 chest radiographs. With our current CAD scheme based on a difference-image technique and linear discriminant analysis, we achieved a sensitivity of 82.4%, with 4.5 false positives per image. We developed the multi-MTANN for further reduction of the false positive rate. An MTANN is a highly nonlinear filter that can be trained with input images and corresponding teaching images. To reduce the effects of background levels in chest radiographs, we applied a background-trend-correction technique, followed by contrast normalization, to the input images for the MTANN. For enhancement of nodules, the teaching image was designed to contain the distribution for a “likelihood of being a nodule.” Six MTANNs in the multi-MTANN were trained by using typical nodules and six different types of non-nodules (false positives).
Results
Use of the trained multi-MTANN eliminated 68.3% of false-positive findings with a reduction of one true-positive result. The false-positive rate of our original CAD scheme was improved from 4.5 to 1.4 false positives per image, at an overall sensitivity of 81.3%.
Conclusion
Use of a multi-MTANN substantially reduced the false-positive rate of our CAD scheme for lung nodule detection on chest radiographs, while maintaining a level of sensitivity.}

abstract = {An efficient algorithm, which exhibits a fourth-order global accuracy, for the numerical solution of the normal and generalized nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations is presented. It has applications for studies of nonlinear pulse propagation and spectral broadening in optical fibers. Simulation of supercontinuum generation processes, in particular, places high demands on numerical accuracy, which makes efficient high-order schemes attractive. The algorithm that is presented here is an adaptation for use in the nonlinear optics field of the fourth-order Runge--Kutta in the Interaction Picture (RK4IP) method, which was originally developed for studies on Bose--Einstein condensates. The performance of the RK4IP method is validated and compared to a number of conventional methods by modeling both the propagation of a second-order soliton and the generation of supercontinuum radiation. It exhibits the expected global fourth-order accuracy for both problems studied and is the most accurate and efficient of the methods tested.},

We prove that any classical Runge-Kutta method can be turned into an invariant method of the same order on a general homogeneous manifold, and present a family of algorithms that are relatively simple to implement. These are defined in a general abstract framework, based on a Lie algebra acting on the manifold. The general framework gives rise to a wide range of different concrete applications; we present some examples.}
