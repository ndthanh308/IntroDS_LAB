A remarkable regularity was suggested in previous studies to look for the light speed variation from high energy photon events of Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs). We provide a general analysis on the data of 25 bright GRBs observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST). Such method allows a completed scan over all possibilities in a more clean and impartial way without any bias compared to previous intuitive analysis. The results show that with the increase in the intrinsic energies of photons, such regularity truly emerges and gradually becomes significant. For photons with intrinsic energies higher than 40 GeV, the regularity exists at a significance of 3-5 $\sigma$ with ELV=3.6× 1017 GeV determined by the GRB data.},

Consequently, new phenomena beyond the standard model are predicted. In particular, the presence of LV highly affects the propagation of astrophysical photons with very high energies from distant galaxies. In this paper, we review the updating theoretical and experimental results on this topic. We classify the effects into three categories: (i) time lags between photons with different energies; (ii) a cutoff of photon flux above the threshold energy of photon decay, $\gamma$→e + +e - ; (iii) new patterns in the spectra of multi-TeV photons and EeV photons, due to the absorption of background lights. As we can see, the details of LV effects on astrophysical photons depend heavily on the "phase space" of LV parameters. From observational aspects, available and upcoming instruments can study these phenomena hopefully, and shed light onto LV issues and QG theories. The most recent progresses and constraints on the ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are also discussed.},

Very high energy (VHE) photon emissions from cosmological distance can amplify these tiny LV effects into observable quantities. Here we analyze four VHE $\gamma$-ray bursts (GRBs) from Fermi observations, and briefly review the constraints from three TeV flares of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) as well. One step further, we present a first robust analysis of VHE GRBs taking the intrinsic time lag caused by sources into account, and give an estimate to quantum gravity energy ∼2×10 17GeV for linear energy dependence, and ∼5×10 9GeV for quadratic dependence. However, the statistics is not sufficient due to the lack of data, and further observational results are desired to constrain LV effects better. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.

A simple estimate indicates that, because of their high energies and distant origin, observations of these bursts should be sensitive to a dispersion scale that is comparable to the Planck energy scale ($\sim$1019GeV), which is sufficient to test theories of quantum gravity.

  abstract      = {We constrain the possibility of a non-trivial refractive index in free space corresponding to an energy-dependent velocity of light: c(E) ≃ c0(1 - E/M), where M is a mass scale that might represent effect of quantum-gravitational space-time foam, using the arrival times of sharp features observed in the intensities of radiation with different energies from a large sample of gamma-ray bursters (GRBs) with known redshifts. We use wavelet techniques to identify genuine features, which we confirm in simulations with artificial added noise. Using the weighted averages of the time-lags calculated using correlated features in all the GRB light curves, we find a systematic tendency for more energetic photons to arrive earlier. However, there is a very strong correlation between the parameters characterizing an intrinsic time-lag at the source and a distance-dependent propagation effect. Moreover, the significance of the earlier arrival times is less evident for a subsample of more robust spectral structures. Allowing for intrinsic stochastic time-lags in these features, we establish a statistically robust lower limit: M > 0.9 × 1016 GeV on the scale of violation of Lorentz invariance. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract      = {It has been suggested that energetic photons propagating in vacuo should experience a non-trivial refractive index due to the foamy structure of space-time induced by quantum-gravitational fluctuations. The sensitivity of recent astrophysical observations, particularly of AGN Mk501 by the MAGIC Collaboration, approaches the Planck scale for a refractive index depending linearly on the photon energy. We present here a new derivation of this quantum-gravitational vacuum refraction index, based on a stringy analogue of the interaction of a photon with internal degrees of freedom in a conventional medium. We model the space-time foam as a gas of D-particles in the bulk space-time of a higher-dimensional cosmology where the observable Universe is a D3-brane. The interaction of an open string representing a photon with a D-particle stretches and excites the string, which subsequently decays and re-emits the photon with a time delay that increases linearly with the photon energy and is related to stringy uncertainty principles. We relate this derivation to other descriptions of the quantum-gravitational refractive index in vacuo. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

It can be viewed as the low-energy limit of a physically relevant fundamental theory with Lorentz-covariant dynamics in which spontaneous Lorentz violation occurs. The extension has gauge invariance, energy-momentum conservation, and covariance under observer rotations and boosts, while covariance under particle rotations and boosts is broken. The quantized theory is Hermitian and power-counting renormalizable, and other desirable features such as microcausality, positivity of the energy, and the usual anomaly cancellation are expected. Spontaneous symmetry breaking to the electromagnetic U(1) is maintained, although the Higgs expectation is shifted by a small amount relative to its usual value and the (Formula presented) field acquires a small expectation. A general Lorentz-breaking extension of quantum electrodynamics is extracted from the theory, and some experimental tests are considered. In particular, we study modifications to photon behavior. One possible effect is vacuum birefringence, which could be bounded from cosmological observations by experiments using existing techniques. Radiative corrections to the photon propagator are examined. They are compatible with spontaneous Lorentz and (Formula presented) violation in the fermion sector at levels suggested by Planck-scale physics and accessible to other terrestrial laboratory experiments. {\textcopyright} 1998 The American Physical Society.},

The D-particles are viewed as D3 branes wrapped up around three cycles, and their embedding in brane worlds constitutes a case of intersecting branes, among which strings are stretched, representing various types of excitations of the Standard Model (SM) particles in the low-energy limit. Our analysis, reveals interesting and novel selection rules for the resulting causal time delays, proportional to the energy of the incident matter state, from the processes of splitting, capture and re-emission of the latter by the D-particles. There are relatively large time delays only for excitations that belong to the Cartan subalgebra of the SM gauge group, which notably includes photons. We discuss the possible relevance of these results to models of space time foam with non-trivial vacuum refractive index for photons and demonstrate how current astrophysical observations can be used to discriminate low- from high-string-scale models in this context. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier B.V.

We evaluate these departures, computing the modifications to Maxwell's equations due to quantum gravity and showing that under certain circumstances nonvanishing corrections appear that depend on the helicity of propagating waves. These effects could lead to observable cosmological predictions of the discrete nature of quantum space-time. In particular, recent observations of nondispersiveness in the spectra of gamma-ray bursts at various energies could be used to constrain the type of semiclassical state that describes the universe. {\textcopyright} 1999 The American Physical Society.},

It is argued in this essay that the experimental detection of such structures may be a realistic possibility in the foreseeable future. After a brief review of different theoretical approaches to quantum gravity and the relationships between them, we discuss various possible experimental tests of the quantum nature of space-time. Observations of photons from distant astrophysical sources such as Gamma-Ray Bursters and laboratory experiments on neutral kaon decays may be sensitive to quantum-gravitational effects if they are only minimally suppressed. Experimental limits from the Whipple Observatory and the CPLEAR Collaboration are already probing close to the Planck scale, and significant increases in sensitivity are feasible.},

This opens a window on physics that may reveal quantum gravity phenomena. It has already constrained the possibility of Planck scale Lorentz violation, which is suggested by some approaches to quantum gravity. In this work we carry out a systematic analysis of reaction thresholds, allowing unequal deformation parameters for different particle dispersion relations. The thresholds are found to have some unusual properties compared with standard ones, such as asymmetric momenta for pair creation and upper thresholds. The results are used together with high energy observational data to determine combined constraints. We focus on the case of photons and electrons, using vacuum {\v{C}}erenkov, photon decay, and photon annihilation processes to determine order unity constraints on the parameters controlling [Formula Presented] Lorentz violation. Interesting constraints for protons (with photons or pions) are obtained even at [Formula Presented] using the absence of vacuum {\v{C}}erenkov and the observed GZK cutoff for ultrahigh energy cosmic rays. A strong {\v{C}}erenkov limit using atmospheric PeV neutrinos is possible for [Formula Presented] deformations provided the rate is high enough. If detected, ultrahigh energy cosmological neutrinos might yield limits at or even beyond [Formula Presented]. {\textcopyright} 2003 The American Physical Society.},

The study on the origin of high-energy cosmic ray is in an interdiscipline between the very high-energy (VHE) gamma-ray astronomy and the cosmic ray physics. The Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) is a unique and new generation cosmic-ray station with the advantages of high altitude, all-weather, and large-scale. It takes the function of hybrid technology to detect cosmic rays and to upgrade greatly the resolving power between gamma rays and cosmic rays. The LHAASO is expected to make the full-sky survey to find new gamma-ray sources, to obtain the highest sensitivity of gamma-ray detection at the high energy band of > 30 TeV, and to make the very high precision measurement on the component energy spectra of cosmic rays in a broad energy range of 5 orders of magnitude, in order to provide the evidence for revealing the mystery of the origin of cosmic ray. This paper describes the detector structure, performance superiority and scientific motivation of the LHAASO.}

abstract = {Recently a series of studies on high energy gamma-ray burst (GRB) photons suggest a light speed variation with linear energy dependence at the Lorentz violation scale of 3.6×1017 GeV, with subluminal propagation of high energy photons in cosmological space. We propose stringy space–time foam as a possible interpretation for this light speed variation. In such a string-inspired scenario, bosonic photon open-string travels in vacuo at an infraluminal speed with an energy dependence suppressed by a single power of the string mass scale, due to the foamy structure of space–time at small scales, as described by D-brane objects in string theory. We present a derivation of this deformed propagation speed of the photon field in the infrared (IR) regime. We show that the light speed variation, revealed in the previous studies on GRBs time-delay data, can be well described within such a string approach towards space–time foam. We also derive the value of the effective quantum-gravity mass in this framework, and give a qualitative study on the theory-dependent coefficients. We comment that stringent constraints on Lorentz violation in the photon sector from complementary astrophysical observations can also be explained and understood in the space–time foam context.}

  abstract = {Attenuation of high-energy gamma-rays by pair production with ultraviolet, optical and infrared (IR) extragalactic background light (EBL) photons provides a link between the history of galaxy formation and high-energy astrophysics. We present results from our latest semi-analytic models (SAMs), which employ the main ingredients thought to be important to galaxy formation and evolution, as well as an improved model for reprocessing of starlight by dust to mid- and far-IR wavelengths. These SAMs are based upon a $\Lambda$ cold dark matter hierarchical structural formation scenario, and are successful in reproducing a large variety of observational constraints such as number counts, luminosity and mass functions and colour bimodality. Our fiducial model is based upon a Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe 5-year cosmology, and treats dust emission using empirical templates. This model predicts a background flux considerably lower than optical and near-IR measurements that rely on subtraction of zodiacal and galactic foregrounds, and near the lower bounds set by number counts of resolvable sources at a large number of wavelengths. We also show the results of varying cosmological parameters and dust attenuation model used in our SAM. For each EBL prediction, we show how the optical depth due to electron-positron pair production is affected by redshift and gamma-ray energy, and the effect of gamma-ray absorption on the spectra of a variety of extragalactic sources. We conclude with a discussion of the implications of our work, comparisons to other models and key measurements of the EBL and a discussion of how the burgeoning science of gamma-ray astronomy will continue to help constrain cosmology. The low EBL flux predicted by our fiducial model suggests an optimistic future for further studies of distant gamma-ray sources. {\textcopyright} 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2012 RAS.},

  abstract = {We analyze deep-inelastic photon-photon collisions via the two-photon mechanism in electron-positron (-electron) colliding beams in a form especially suitable for experimental analysis. It is shown that by a helicity analysis similar to that used in electroproduction experiments, we can separate five of the eight structure functions describing the process *+* hadrons. The helicity cross sections for this process and for the process with one real photon (inelastic electron-photon scattering) are related to structure functions, and are evaluated using quark light-cone algebra. There are anomalous contributions to the structure functions for the inelastic electron-photon scattering which arise both in parton as well as generalized vector-meson-dominance models. This suggests a connection between these two types of models for photon-photon scattering. Further, we use vector-meson dominance to construct a sum rule for hadrons from which it is estimated that roughly 20% of the cross section should be built up from higher-mass vector states. Using a spectral representation for the total transverse cross section, and the "aligned-jet" vector-dominance model we achieve a connection, via a "correspondence principle," with the parton model for the hadron multiplicities in photon-photon collisions. We also comment on inclusive pion multiplicities and the approach to scaling for photon-photon processes in the light-cone algebra. {\textcopyright} 1976 The American Physical Society.},

  abstract = {<p>Investigations of the possibility that some novel "quantum" properties of space–time might induce a Planck-scale modification of the energy/momentum dispersion relation focused at first on scenarios with Planck-scale violations of Lorentz symmetry, with an associated reduced n-parameter (n&lt;6) rotation-boost symmetry group. More recently several studies have also considered the possibility of a "doubly special relativity," in which the modification of the dispersion relation emerges from a framework with both the Planck scale and the speed-of-light scale as characteristic scales of a 6-parameter group of rotation-boost symmetry transformations (a deformation of the Lorentz transformations). For the schemes with broken Lorentz symmetry at the Planck scale there is a large literature on the derivation of experimental limits. Here we show that the analysis of the experimental limits could be significantly different in a doubly-special-relativity framework. We find that the study of photon stability, synchrotron radiation, and threshold conditions for particle production in collision processes, the three contexts which are considered as most promising for constraining the broken-Lorentz-symmetry scenario, should not provide significant constraints on a doubly-special-relativity parameter space. However, certain types of analyses of gamma-ray bursts should be sensitive to the symmetry deformation. A key element of our study is an observation that removes a possible sign ambiguity for the doubly-special-relativity framework. This result also allows us to characterize more sharply the differences between the doubly-special-relativity framework and the framework of κ-Poincaré Hopf algebras, two frameworks which are often confused with each other in the literature.</p>},

   abstract = {Motivated by various theoretical arguments that the Planck energy (E plank∼1019 GeV) should herald departures from Lorentz invariance, and the possibility of testing these expectations in the not too distant future, two so-called "doubly special relativity" theories have been suggested - the first by Amelino-Camelia (DSR1) and the second by Smolin and Magueijo (DSR2). These theories contain two fundamental scales - the speed of light and an energy usually taken to be Eplank. The symmetry group is still the Lorentz group, but in both cases acting nonlinearly on the energy-momentum sector. Since energy and momentum are no longer additive quantities, finding their values for composite systems (and hence finding appropriate conservation laws) is a nontrivial matter. Ultimately it is these possible deviations from simple linearly realized relativistic kinematics that provide the most promising observational signal for empirically testing these models. Various investigations have narrowed the conservation laws down to two possibilities per DSR theory. We derive unique exact results for the energy momentum of composite systems in both DSR1 and DSR2, and indicate the general strategy for arbitrary nonlinear realizations of the Lorentz group. © 2003 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), as extremely energetic explosions in the universe, are widely believed to consist of two stages: the prompt phase and the subsequent afterglow. Recent studies indicate that some high-energy photons are emitted earlier at source than the prompt phase. Due to the light speed variation, these high-energy photons travel more slowly than the low-energy photons, so that they are observed after the prompt low-energy photons at the detector. Based on the data from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope (FGST), we analyse the photon distribution before the prompt emission in detail and propose the existence of a hitherto unknown pre-burst stage of GRBs by adopting a classification method of machine learning. Analysis on the photons automatically selected by machine learning also produces a light speed variation at ELV=3.55×1017GeV.}
