\begin{example}[Fuzzy \osf interpretation]
\label{ex:fuzzy_osf_interpretation}
  Consider the fuzzy \osf signature of \cref{ex:fuzzy_osf_signature} and
  let $\ii = \osfa$ be defined as follows.
  \begin{itemize}
    \item The domain is $\dom[\ii] = \{
      \psycho,
      \halloween,
      \hitchcock,
      \carpenter,
      \obj{``Psycho''},
      \obj{``Halloween''},
      \nullv
    \}$.
    \item The interpretation of the sort symbols is defined by letting
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $\thriller^\ii(\halloween) = 0.5$ and
        $\horror^\ii(\halloween) = \slasher^\ii(\halloween) = 1$;
      \item $\thriller^\ii(\psycho) = \horror^\ii(\psycho)
        = 1$ and $\slasher^\ii(\psycho) = 0.7$;
      \item $\movie^\ii(\psycho) =\movie^\ii(\halloween) = 1$;
      \item $\strng^\ii(\obj{``Psycho''}) =
        \strng^\ii(\obj{``Halloween''}) = 1$;
      \item $\person^\ii(\hitchcock) =
        \person^\ii(\carpenter) = 1$;
      \item $\director^\ii(\hitchcock) =
        \director^\ii(\carpenter) = 1$;
      \item $\tops^\ii(x) = 1$ for every $x\in\dom[\ii]$; and
      \item all the remaining membership degrees are equal to 0.
    \end{itemize}
    \item The interpretation of the feature symbols is defined by letting
    \begin{itemize}
      \item $\dirby^\ii(\psycho) = \hitchcock$ and
        $\dirby^\ii(\halloween) = \carpenter$;
      \item $\ttle^\ii(\psycho) = \obj{``Psycho''}$ and
        $\ttle^\ii(\halloween) = \obj{``Halloween''}$; and
      \item all the remaining feature applications are equal to \nullv.
    \end{itemize}
  \end{itemize}
  This is easily verified to satisfy all constraints of
  \cref{def:osf_algebra}. In particular $\thriller^\ii(\halloween) =
  0.5 \geq 1\land 0.5 = \slasher^\ii(\halloween)\land\fisa(\slasher,
  \thriller)$.
\end{example}
Since features are interpreted as \textit{total} functions, in
the last example the feature $\ttle$ had to be defined also for elements of
sort $\person$ such as $\hitchcock$. While we can circumvent this issue by
assigning
$\ttle^\ii(\hitchcock)=\nullv$, there are versions of \osf logic that
interpret features as \textit{partial}
functions instead \cite{Smolka1988,Carpenter1992,AitKaci2007b}. An
analogous extension of fuzzy \osf logic
is left for future work.
