  "abstract": "Context: Agile Governance Theory (AGT) has emerged as a potential model for organizational chains of responsibility across business units and teams. Objective: This study aims to assess how AGT is reflected in practice. Method: AGT was operationalized down into 16 testable hypotheses. All hypotheses were tested by arranging eight theoretical scenarios with 118 practitioners from 86 organizations and 19 countries who completed an in-depth explanatory scenario-based survey. The feedback results were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA). Results: The analyses supported key theory components and hypotheses, such as mediation between agile capabilities and business operations through governance capabilities. Conclusion: This study supports the theory and suggests that AGT can assist teams in gaining a better understanding of their organization governance in an agile context. A better understanding can help remove delays and misunderstandings that can come about with unclear decision-making channels, which can jeopardize the fulfillment of the overall strategy.",
