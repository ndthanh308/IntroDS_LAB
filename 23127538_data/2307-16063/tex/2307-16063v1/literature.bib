It can be applied together with the recently developed code LiteRed by Lee in order to provide an integration by parts reduction to master integrals for quite complicated families of Feynman integrals. As an example, we consider four-loop massless propagator integrals for which LiteRed provides reduction rules and FIRE assists to apply these rules. So, as a by-product one obtains a four-loop variant of the well-known algorithm MINCER. The existence of these explicit reduction rules shows that any four-loop massless propagator integral can be reduced to a linear combination of master integrals in the sense of a mathematical theorem. We also describe various algebraic ways to find additional relations between master integrals associated with several families of Feynman integrals.

The optimization of the C++ code, generated using FORM, is improved, leading to a faster numerical convergence. The new version also creates a library of the integrand functions, such that it can be linked to user-specific codes for the evaluation of matrix elements in a way similar to analytic integral libraries.
Program summary
Program Title: pySecDec Program Files doi: http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/3y8bbz9c9v.1 Licensing provisions: GNU Public License v3 Programming language: python, FORM, C++ External routines/libraries: catch [1], gsl [2], numpy [3], sympy [4], Nauty [5], Cuba [6], FORM [7], Normaliz [8]. The program can also be used in a mode which does not require Normaliz. Journal reference of previous version: Comput. Phys. Commun. 196 (2015) 470–491. Nature of the problem: Extraction of ultraviolet and infrared singularities from parametric integrals appearing in higher order perturbative calculations in quantum field theory. Numerical integration in the presence of integrable singularities (e.g. kinematic thresholds). Solution method: Algebraic extraction of singularities within dimensional regularization using iterated sector decomposition. This leads to a Laurent series in the dimensional regularization parameter ϵ (and optionally other regulators), where the coefficients are finite integrals over the unit-hypercube. Those integrals are evaluated numerically by Monte Carlo integration. The integrable singularities are handled by choosing a suitable integration contour in the complex plane, in an automated way. The parameter integrals forming the coefficients of the Laurent series in the regulator(s) are provided in the form of libraries which can be linked to the calculation of (multi-) loop amplitudes. Restrictions: Depending on the complexity of the problem, limited by memory and CPU time.

These lectures give a review of these developments, while not assuming any prior knowledge of the subject. After an introduction to DE for Feynman integrals, we point out how they can be simplified using algorithms available in the mathematical literature. We discuss how this is related to a recent conjecture for a canonical form of the equations. We also discuss a complementary approach that is based on properties of the space–time loop integrands, and explain how the ideas of leading singularities and d-log representations can be used to find an optimal basis for the DE. Finally, as an application of these ideas we show how single-scale integrals can be bootstrapped using the Drinfeld associator of a DE.}

abstract = {The Z decay into Higgs plus photon Z→Hγ (for mH<mz) and the rare Higgs decay mode H→Zγ (for mH>mz) are mediated by loops and can thus provide information on new particle spectra. To exploit this potential, the predictions of the standard model must be determined accurately. Besides W loops, the HZγ vertex is built up by heavy quark loops in the standard model. We present the QCD corrections to these processes which turn out to be of order αsπ, and thus are well under control.}

abstract = {The Higgs decay into two photons H→γγ plays a crucial role for searching this particle in the intermediate mass range at the future pp colliders LHC and SSC. Photon-photon fusion, on the other hand, provides a most important source for Higgs particles in high-energy e+e− colliders. Besides the W loop, the Hγγ coupling is built up by heavy quark loops. We present the result of the (two-loop) radiative QCD correction to this process for a Higgs particle in the intermediate mass range. Being of order αsπ, this correction is well under control.}
