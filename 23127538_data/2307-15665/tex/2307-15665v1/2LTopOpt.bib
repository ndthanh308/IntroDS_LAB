  abstract =     {It is of great importance for the development of new products to find the best possible topology or layout for given design objectives and constraints at a very early stage of the design process (the conceptual and project definition phase). Thus, over the last decade, substantial efforts of fundamental research have been devoted to the development of efficient and reliable procedures for solution of such problems. During this period, the researchers have been mainly occupied with two different kinds of topology design processes; the Material or Microstructure Technique and the Geometrical or Macrostructure Technique. It is the objective of this review paper to present an overview of the developments within these two types of techniques with special emphasis on optimum topology and layout design of linearly elastic 2D and 3D continuum structures. Starting from the mathematical-physical concepts of topology and layout optimization, several methods are presented and the applicability is illustrated by a number of examples. New areas of application of topology optimization are discussed at the end of the article. This review article includes 425 references. 2001 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

   abstract = {We present a novel approach to 3D structural shape optimization that leans on an Immersed Boundary Method. A boundary tracking strategy based on evaluating the intersections between a fixed Cartesian grid and the evolving geometry sorts elements as internal, external and intersected. The integration procedure used by the NURBS-Enhanced Finite Element Method accurately accounts for the nonconformity between the fixed embedding discretization and the evolving structural shape, avoiding the creation of a boundary-fitted mesh for each design iteration, yielding in very efficient mesh generation process. A Cartesian hierarchical data structure improves the efficiency of the analyzes, allowing for trivial data sharing between similar entities or for an optimal reordering of the matrices for the solution of the system of equations, among other benefits. Shape optimization requires the sufficiently accurate structural analysis of a large number of different designs, presenting the computational cost for each design as a critical issue. The information required to create 3D Cartesian h-adapted mesh for new geometries is projected from previously analyzed geometries using shape sensitivity results. Then, the refinement criterion permits one to directly build h-adapted mesh on the new designs with a specified and controlled error level. Several examples are presented to show how the techniques here proposed considerably improve the computational efficiency of the optimization process.},

The basic idea is the iterative positioning of new holes (so-called "bubbles") into the present structure of the component. This concept is therefore called the "bubble method". The iterative positioning of new bubbles is carried out by means of different methods, among others by solving a variational problem. The insertion of a new bubble leads to a change of the class of topology. For these different classes of topology, hierarchically structured shape optimizations that determine the optimal shape of the current bubble, as well as the other variable boundaries, are carried out.

This allows us to derive simple necessary conditions for the possible realization of grey-scale via composites, leading to a physical interpretation of all feasible designs as well as the optimal design.

   abstract = {This work presents a generalized topology optimization approach for the design of hierarchical lattice structures with the development of an Approximation of Reduced Substructure with Penalization (ARSP) model. The structure is assumed to be composed of substructures with a common lattice geometry pattern. Unlike conventional homogenization-based designs assuming the separation of scales, this work considers two different yet connected scales. Each substructure is condensed first into a super-element with a reduced degrees of freedom and is associated with a density design variable indicating the material volume fraction. The density design variable is linked to a lattice geometry feature parameter. A surrogate model is particularly built with the aid of proper orthogonal decomposition and diffuse approximation, mapping the density to super-element stiffness matrix. The derivative of super-element matrix with respect to the associated density can therefore be evaluated efficiently and explicitly. The super-element matrix is further augmented with a penalized density to control the structural complexity. The optimality criteria method is used for the update of design variables. Numerical examples show that both the size and the lattice pattern of substructure have essential influences on the design, indicating the necessity of performing connected hierarchical modeling and design.},

   abstract = {The work deals on computational design of structural materials by resorting to computational homogenization and topological optimization techniques. The goal is then to minimize the structural (macro-scale) compliance by appropriately designing the material distribution (microstructure) at a lower scale (micro-scale), which, in turn, rules the mechanical properties of the material. The specific features of the proposed approach are: (1) The cost function to be optimized (structural stiffness) is defined at the macro-scale, whereas the design variables defining the micro-structural topology lie on the low scale. Therefore a coupled, two-scale (macro/micro), optimization problem is solved unlike the classical, single-scale, topological optimization problems. (2) To overcome the exorbitant computational cost stemming from the multiplicative character of the aforementioned multiscale approach, a specific strategy, based on the consultation of a discrete material catalog of micro-scale optimized topologies (Computational Vademecum) is used. The Computational Vademecum is computed in an offline process, which is performed only once for every constitutive-material, and it can be subsequently consulted as many times as desired in the online design process. This results into a large diminution of the resulting computational costs, which make affordable the proposed methodology for multiscale computational material design. Some representative examples assess the performance of the considered approach.},

From a manufacturing stand-point, support structure requirement decreases with increased extent of latticing, whereas the design-to-manufacture discrepancies and the processing efforts, both in terms of memory requirements and time, increase. Results from Finite Element (FE) analysis for the two loading scenarios considered: intended loading, and variability in loading, provide insight into the solution optimality and robustness of the design strategies.

The geometrical presentation utilises the physical concepts of nodal forces and Maxwell force diagrams based on nodal equilibrium. Only small problems have to be solved for each node. This presentation complements the original algebraic approach of Ladeveze, and extends the method to cover the use of hierarchical p-elements in regular meshes, and general higher-order elements in 1-irregular meshes as encountered in h-p mesh refinement. The same presentation is considered for the recovery of residual tractions as required in the solution of the local residual problem. Comparison is made with related methods for obtaining residual tractions, in particular those proposed by Bank and Weiser and Ainsworth et al. Detailed examples are included to illustrate the presentation. This paper considers only the fundamental aspects of recovering equilibrating tractions.

The proposed methodology, so-called cg-FEM (Cartesian grid FEM), has been implemented for fast and accurate numerical analysis of 2D linear elasticity problems. The traditional FEM uses geometry-conforming meshes; however, in cg-FEM the analysis mesh is not conformal to the geometry. This allows for defining very efficient mesh generation techniques and using a robust integration procedure, to accurately integrate the domain&#x2019;s geometry. The hierarchical data structure used in cg-FEM together with the Cartesian meshes allow for trivial data sharing between similar entities. The cg-FEM methodology uses advanced recovery techniques to obtain an improved solution of the displacement and stress fields (for which a discretization error estimator in energy norm is available) that will be the output of the analysis. All this results in a substantial increase in accuracy and computational efficiency with respect to the standard FEM. cg-FEM has been applied in structural shape optimization showing robustness and computational efficiency in comparison with FEM solutions obtained with a commercial code, despite  the fact that cg-FEM has been fully implemented in MATLAB.},

@article{Munoz2022,
   abstract = {The growing number of scientific publications on topology optimization (TO) shows the great interest that this technique has generated in recent years. Among the different methodologies for TO, this article focuses on the well-known solid isotropic material penalization (SIMP) method, broadly used because of its simple formulation and efficiency. Even so, the SIMP method has certain drawbacks, namely: lack of precision in definition of the edges of the optimized geometry and final results strongly influenced by the discretization used for the finite element (FE) analyses. In this article, we propose a combination of techniques to limit the effect of these drawbacks and, thus, to improve the behavior of TO. All these techniques are based on the use of the Cartesian grid finite element method (cgFEM), an immersed boundary method whose Cartesian grid structure and hierarchical data structure makes it specially appropriate for TO. All the proposed techniques are framed under the concept of mesh refinement. First, we propose the use of two meshes, the FE analysis mesh, and a finer mesh for integration and evaluation of sensitivities, to improve the resolution of the final solution at a marginal computational cost. Then we propose two h-adaptive mesh refinement strategies. The first one will tend to refine the elements having intermediate density values and will have the effect of sharpening the definition of the edges of the optimized geometry. We will clearly show that if the accuracy of the FE analyses is not taken into account, stress constrained TO will generate solutions that, once manufactured, will not satisfy the constraints. Hence, we also propose an h-refinement strategy based on the estimation of the discretization error in energy norm.},

The multiobjective problems are treated via a max-min formulation based on a variable lower bound technique, and this approach is shown to yield much more significant results than the usual weighted sum formulation of multiobjective problems.

For prescribed loading and boundary conditions, and subject to a specified amount of structural material within a given three-dimensional design domain, the optimum structural topology is determined from the condition of maximum integral stiffness, which is equivalent to minimum elastic compliance or minimum total elastic energy at equilibrium. The use of optimum microstructures in the present work renders the local topology optimization problem convex, and the fact that local optima are avoided implies that we can develop and present a simple sensitivity based numerical method of mathematical programming for solution of the complete optimization problem. Several examples of optimum topology designs of three-dimensional structures are presented at the end of the paper. These examples include some illustrative full three-dimensional layout and topology optimization problems for plate-like structures. The solutions to these problems are compared to results obtained earlier in the literature by application of usual two-dimensional plate theories, and clearly illustrate the advantage of the full three-dimensional approach.},

However, in practice it does not allow for the nucleation of new holes (at least in 2-d). On the other hand, the bubble or topological gradient method is precisely designed for introducing new holes in the optimization process. Therefore, the coupling of these two method yields an efficient algorithm which can escape from local minima in a given topological class of shapes. Both methods rely on the notion of gradient computed through an adjoint analysis, and have a low CPU cost since they capture a shape on a fixed Eulerian mesh. The main advantage of our coupled algorithm is to make the resulting optimal design largely independent of the initial guess.},

We consider Isogeometric Analysis for the spatial approximation which facilitates encapsulating the exactness of the representation of the design domain in the topology optimization and is particularly suitable for the analysis of phase field problems. We demonstrate the validity of the approach and numerical approximation by solving two and three-dimensional topology optimization problems. Â© 2012 CIMNE, Barcelona, Spain.},

   abstract = {In this paper, we propose a novel graded multiscale topology optimization framework by exploiting the unique classification capacity of neural networks. The salient features of this framework include: (1) the number of design variables is only weakly dependent on the number of pre-selected microstructures, (2) it guarantees partition of unity while discouraging microstructure mixing, (3) it supports automatic differentiation, thereby eliminating manual sensitivity analysis, and (4) it supports high-resolution re-sampling, leading to smoother variation of microstructure topologies. The proposed framework is illustrated through several examples.},

@article{Amstutz2010,
   abstract = {The topological asymptotic analysis provides the sensitivity of a given shape functional with respect to an infinitesimal domain perturbation. Therefore, this sensitivity can be naturally used as a descent direction in a structural topology design problem. However, according to the literature concerning the topological derivative, only the classical approach based on flexibility minimization for a given amount of material, without control on the stress level supported by the structural device, has been considered. In this paper, therefore, we introduce a class of penalty functionals that mimic a pointwise constraint on the Von Mises stress field. The associated topological derivative is obtained for plane stress linear elasticity. Only the formal asymptotic expansion procedure is presented, but full justifications can be deduced from existing works. Then, a topology optimization algorithm based on these concepts is proposed, that allows for treating local stress criteria. Finally, this feature is shown through some numerical examples.

@article{Goncalves2022,
   abstract = {In this work, a bi-directional evolutionary topology optimization algorithm capable of reinforcing the structure at critical high stress regions is combined with the Natural Neighbour Radial Point Interpolation Method (NNRPIM). The NNRPIM uses the VoronoÃ¯ diagram and natural neighbour concept to establish the background integration points, enforce the nodal connectivity, and construct the RPI shape functions. State-of-the-art of meshless methods in topology optimization is limited when compared with the classic Finite Element Method. Hence, this work originally introduces an accurate truly meshless method, the NNRPIM, to the topology optimization field. The proposed algorithm is validated by solving several benchmark topology optimization problems. A parametric study on algorithm parameters and mesh influence is performed, and the computational processing time is also evaluated Finally, the proposed calibrated method is extended to design lightweight aircraft industry components.},
