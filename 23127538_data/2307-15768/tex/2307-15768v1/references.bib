  abstract   = {This article examines how product and consumer characteristics moderate the influence of online consumer reviews on product sales using data from the video game industry. The findings indicate that online reviews are more influential for less popular games and games whose players have greater Internet experience. The article shows differential impact of consumer reviews across products in the same product category and suggests that firms? online marketing strategies should be contingent on product and consumer characteristics. The authors discuss the implications of these results in light of the increased share of niche products in recent years.},

  abstract   = {Online product reviews provided by consumers who previously purchased products have become a major information source for
                consumers and marketers regarding product quality. This study extends previous research by conducting a more compelling test
                of the effect of online reviews on sales. In particular, we consider both quantitative and qualitative aspects of online reviews,
                such as reviewer quality, reviewer exposure, product coverage, and temporal effects. Using transaction cost economics and
                uncertainty reduction theories, this study adopts a portfolio approach to assess the effectiveness of the online review market.
                We show that consumers understand the value difference between favorable news and unfavorable news and respond accordingly.
                Furthermore, when consumers read online reviews, they pay attention not only to review scores but to other contextual information
                such as a reviewer's reputation and reviewer exposure. The market responds more favorably to reviews written by reviewers
                with better reputation and higher exposure. Finally, we demonstrate that the impact of online reviews on sales diminishes
                over time. This suggests that firms need not provide incentives for customers to write reviews beyond a certain time period
                after products have been released.},

  abstract  = {This paper contains a new review of the research of the last decade that has been designed to shed light on how the art auction system works, what it indicates about price formation, and how well it performs. We begin with a short description of the mechanics of the auction system and then organize the remainder of our discussion around two major topics. The first topic concerns how researchers have used auction prices. We begin by discussing the returns to holding art and whether certain classes of art make a better investment. We then discuss studies that have used auction prices to determine the importance of individual works of art and individual artists. We conclude this topic by discussing whether different auction houses achieve systematically different prices. The second topic focuses on studies that examine the influence of the auction mechanism on prices. We begin with a discussion of the Christie's and Sotheby's price fixing case and the role of the competitive behavior of auction houses in the determination of prices. We move on to discuss the role of experts and price estimates in auctions. We then look at whether items that fail at auction subsequently return less than items that have not failed and furthermore discuss sale rates and reserve prices. We conclude this topic by reviewing the extensive literature that has documented and tried to explain why the prices of identical objects are more likely to decline than to increase when multiple units are sold. Subsequent empirical research has tended to document declining prices even when the objects are imperfect substitutes.},

  abstract = {In early 2021, non-fungible tokens (NFT) became the first application of blockchain technology to achieve clear public prominence. NFTs are tradeable rights to digital assets (images, music, videos, virtual creations) where ownership is recorded in smart contracts on a blockchain. Given the NFT market emerged out of cryptocurrencies, we explore if NFT pricing is related to cryptocurrency pricing. A spillover index shows only limited volatility transmission effects between cryptocurrencies and NFTs. But wavelet coherence analysis indicates co-movement between the two sets of markets. This suggests that cryptocurrency pricing behaviours might be of some benefit in understanding NFT pricing patterns. However, the low volatility transmissions also indicate that NFTs can potentially be considered as a low-correlation asset class distinct from cryptocurrencies.},

This first-ever study of coherence between returns of NFTs and major assets employs the wavelet approach. The pairwise returns coherence between the considered markets grows throughout the Covid-19. Before the pandemic, NFTs lag behind stocks (2017) and bitcoin (2018), while lead gold (2018). We reveal that the returns coherence between NFTs and other assets is high/low for the two-week-plus/below-to-weeks investment horizons. We refine Aharon and Demir´s (2021) findings stating that NFTs absorbed risk during Covid-19 by demonstrating that this conclusion holds only in the short-run for below-two-weeks horizons.},

We examined the extreme risk transmission of blockchain markets using the quantile connectedness technique at the median, extreme low, and extreme high volatility conditions. We find significant risk spillovers among blockchain markets with strong disconnection of NFTs. Meanwhile, time-varying features characterized various uneven economic circumstances. Overall, NFTs offer greater diversification avenues with substantial risk-bearing potential among other blockchain markets to shelter the investments and minimize extreme risks.},

We examine Pearson’s correlation, the Gerber Statistic for co-movement, and the spillover index for volatility transmission. Our findings suggest that NFTs are distinct from traditional assets, potentially resulting in portfolio diversification. Using the mean–variance approach, empirical results demonstrate there exist a statistically significant evidence that the inclusion of NFTs improves the performance of equally weighted and tangency portfolio strategies in terms of Sharpe ratio. It confirms that NFTs have a diversification effect on the traditional asset-based portfolios.},
