abstract = {Abstract Quantum reservoir networks combine the intelligence of neural networks with the potential of quantum computing in a single platform. This platform operates on the architecture of reservoir computing, which can function even with random connections between neural nodes. This is a major advantage for hardware implementation. Herein is described how reservoir computing is brought into the quantum domain to perform various tasks, including characterization of quantum states, quantum estimation, quantum state preparation, and quantum computing. It shows quantum enhancement in classical data processing, and creates the opportunity for quantum information processing within the robust paradigm of neural networks. It is friendly for implementation in a wide range of physical systems, including quantum dots, superconductors, trapped ions, cold atoms, and exciton-polaritons.},

abstract = {Quantum reservoir computing is a class of quantum machine learning algorithms involving a reservoir of an echo state network based on a register of qubits, but the dependence of its memory capacity on the hyperparameters is still rather unclear. In order to maximize its accuracy in time–series predictive tasks, we investigate the relation between the memory of the network and the reset rate of the evolution of the quantum reservoir. We benchmark the network performance by three non–linear maps with fading memory on IBM quantum hardware. The memory capacity of the quantum reservoir is maximized for central values of the memory reset rate in the interval [0,1]. As expected, the memory capacity increases approximately linearly with the number of qubits. After optimization of the memory reset rate, the mean squared errors of the predicted outputs in the tasks may decrease by a factor ∼1/5 with respect to previous implementations.}

This means that any discrete-time filter that satisfies the fading memory property with random inputs of that type can be uniformly approximated by elements in the non-homogeneous state-affine family.},

They exploit the quantumness of physical systems combined with an easy training strategy, achieving an excellent performance. The increasing interest in these unconventional computing approaches is fueled by the availability of diverse quantum platforms suitable for implementation and the theoretical progresses in the study of complex quantum systems. In this review article, recent proposals and first experiments displaying a broad range of possibilities are reviewed when quantum inputs, quantum physical substrates and quantum tasks are considered. The main focus is the performance of these approaches, on the advantages with respect to classical counterparts and opportunities.},

If the activation function is continuous, bounded and nonconstant, then continuous mappings can be learned uniformly over compact input sets. We also give very general conditions ensuring that networks with sufficiently smooth activation functions are capable of arbitrarily accurate approximation to a{\_}Function and its derivatives.},
