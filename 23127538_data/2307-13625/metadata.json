  "abstract": "The ac electrical transport properties of polycrystalline Pr$_2$MgZrO$_6$ (PMZ) have been investigated using conductivity and impedance spectroscopic techniques. The crystal structure of PMZ has been determined to be monoclinic through a combination of X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopic studies. Ag mode in the Raman spectra has been identified as the breathing vibration of the ZrO6 octahedra. The ac conductivity spectra of PMZ exhibit distinct characteristics at different temperature ranges. At lower temperatures (less than 420 K), the spectra are fitted using a double power law, indicating the involvement of multiple microstructural features. On the other hand, at higher temperatures (greater than 460 K), the spectra follow Jonscher's law, suggesting a simpler conduction mechanism. Through the analysis of conductivity, permittivity, and impedance, an insulator-metal transition has been observed around 452 K. This transition signifies a significant change in the electrical properties of PMZ and provides valuable insights into its conductive nature.",
