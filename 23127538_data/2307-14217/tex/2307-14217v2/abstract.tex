% This is the abstract for the paper
In this work we consider the two dimensional instationary Navier-Stokes equations
with homogeneous Dirichlet/no-slip boundary conditions.
We show error estimates for the fully discrete problem, where a discontinuous Galerkin method in time
and inf-sup stable finite elements in space are used.
% Recently, a best approximation type estimate for the error in the $L^\infty(I;L^2(\Omega))$ norm
% for the Stokes problem has been shown.
% The present work extends this error estimate to the Navier-Stokes equations, by
% pursuing an error splitting approach.
% The necessary regularity of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations is analyzed 
% to estimate the first part of the error.
% The second part, facilitated by the variational formulation of the dG time discretization,
% is treated by an appropriate duality argument.
% A specialized Gronwall lemma is presented, which allows the analysis of the discrete
% dual equation.
% The techniques developed in this work allow us to show also best approximation type error estimates 
% in the $L^2(I;H^1(\Omega))$ and $L^2(I;L^2(\Omega))$ norms, which we present.

Recently, best approximation type error estimates for the Stokes problem in the $L^\infty(I;L^2(\Omega))$, 
$L^2(I;H^1(\Omega))$ and $L^2(I;L^2(\Omega))$ norms have been shown.
The main result of the present work extends the error estimate in the $L^\infty(I;L^2(\Omega))$ norm 
to the Navier-Stokes equations, by pursuing an error splitting approach and an appropriate duality argument.
In order to discuss the stability of solutions to the discrete primal and dual equations,
a \blue{specially tailored} discrete Gronwall lemma is presented.
The techniques developed towards showing the $L^\infty(I;L^2(\Omega))$
error estimate, also allow us to show best approximation 
type error estimates in the $L^2(I;H^1(\Omega))$ and $L^2(I;L^2(\Omega))$ norms, which complement this work.
