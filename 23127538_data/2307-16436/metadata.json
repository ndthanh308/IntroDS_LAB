  "abstract": "We study self-regulating processes modeling biological transportation networks as presented in \\cite{portaro2023}. In particular, we focus on the 1D setting for Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. We prove an existence and uniqueness result under the assumption of positivity of the diffusivity $D$. We explore systematically various scenarios and gain insights into the behavior of $D$ and its impact on the studied system. This involves analyzing the system with a signed measure distribution of sources and sinks. Finally, we perform several numerical tests in which the solution $D$ touches zero, confirming the previous hints of local existence in particular cases.",
