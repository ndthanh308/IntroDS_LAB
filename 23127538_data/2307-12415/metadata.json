  "abstract": "Let $k$ be a field of positive characteristic $p>2$. We prove a duality property concerning the kernel of coinduced representations of Lie superalgebras. This property was already proved by M. Duflo for Lie algebras in any characteristic under more restrictive finiteness conditions. It was then generalized to Lie superalgebras in characteristic 0 in previous works of the author. In a second part of the article, we study the links between coinduced representations and induced representations in the case of restricted Lie superalgebras.",
