In this preliminary work, we provide a novel physical layer authentication mechanism in underwater acoustic communication networks. Specifically, we propose position of the transmitter nodes for authentication purpose. First, we do position estimation from the received signals at the anchored/reference nodes deployed at the fixed positions in a predefined  underwater region based on Time of Arrival (ToA) estimation. We also derive the distribution of inherent uncertainty in the estimation. Next, on the estimated position, we do binary hypothesis testing to decide for the legitimacy of the transmitter nodes. We provide closed form expressions of false alarm and missed detection resulted from binary hypothesis testing. We provide the simulation results demonstrating errors' behaviour against total transmit power.
