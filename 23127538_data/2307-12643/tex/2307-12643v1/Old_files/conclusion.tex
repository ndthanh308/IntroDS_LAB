\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
This preliminary work studied physical layer authentication based on position of transmitting node. Position is estimated based on Time of Arrival (ToA) estimation for which best unbiased estimator was used. The distribution of uncertainty in estimation was derived. Further, to counter impersonation, binary hypothesis testing was used to classify the transmissions of transmitters into legitimate or malicious transmissions. The closed form expression for errors resulted from hypothesis testing were derived. We observed from simulation results that position can be used as device fingerprint for physical layer authentication. The follow up future work will counter mobility of legitimate AUV for investigation.
