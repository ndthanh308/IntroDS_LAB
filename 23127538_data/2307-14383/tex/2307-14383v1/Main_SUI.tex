% Page limit: 8000 words single column (final version: max. 9 pages double column + references)
% As an essential part of medical education, anatomy learning has been reshaped in recent decades. There are several challenges related to 
% traditional teaching methods, including the limited resources for performing dissection or pro-section in   large classes, or on the flip-side, the difficulty of students to understand the complexities of human body, and to perform proper mental mapping by just viewing two-dimensional anatomical structures in a textbook.
% In this paper, we investigate the use of modern technologies such as augmented and virtual reality as a complement or replacement of textbooks in an anatomy learning intervention.
% In a team-based study with 236 students in undergraduate premedical programs, students who used both of our in-house augmented reality(AR), and virtual reality (VR) interactive applications were as successful as those who used textbook; their familiar learning instrument; and no difference was observed between study conditions based on knowledge retention. 
% For user experience, students reflected that they enjoyed completing the learning activity using the AR and VR learning tools more \note{(F()=, p<0.05)}.
% We also investigated gender effect in our data and identified \note{significantly higher knowledge retention for females rather than males (F(1,299)=4.44, $p\!<\!0.05$).}
% The findings from this work may offer implications on modern learning technologies for anatomy and medical education.
%While anatomy learning is an essential part of medical education, there are significant challenges in traditional learning methods, e.g., related to the limited resources for performing dissection/pro-section in large classes, and the learning difficulty to understand the complexities of human body and to perform proper mental mapping based on two-dimensional anatomical structures in a textbook.
%With advanced technology-based learning tools, such as using virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR), anatomy learning has been reshaped in recent decades.
%In this paper, we developed in-house tablet-based VR application and screen-based AR system that could superimpose and visualize 3D virtual anatomy models with informative labels. 
%To investigate the effects of interactive VR/AR learning tools on \expMeasure and knowledge retention, a large-scale team-based study with 236 students (males: 95, females: 141) from undergraduate premedical programs were recruited.The participant students experienced an anatomy learning intervention, which involves muscle painting activities, using one of the learning tools: (1) conventional textbook, (2) tablet-based VR, and (3) screen-based AR.
%The results showed that students with our VR or AR tool reported higher (more positive) \expMeasure scores than those who used a textbook.We did not observe any difference on knowledge retention among the three learning tools, but our further analysis about gender effects revealed that male participants generally reported more positive \expMeasure scores than female participants.
%While discussing implications of our results in the context of the anatomy and medical education, we suggest that VR/AR learning tools could be a complement or replacement of textbooks in anatomy learning interventions.

% Anatomy is an essential part of medical education, but using new technology for teaching it still remains a huge challenge. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate two in-house screen-based virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) anatomy training solutions that can visualize and superimpose 3D virtual anatomy models with informative labels on a display. We report the usability and learning experience findings from a large-scale study with 236 (19.77 years/pm 1.07, 141F) undergraduate premedical students. The participant students were split into three groups to use one of the following learning tools in a team-based anatomy painting activity: (1) conventional textbook, (2) tablet-based VR, and (3) screen-based AR. Students who used our VR or AR learning tools reported significantly higher (more positive) learning experience scores than textbook groups. We suggest that VR/AR learning tools have the potential to be considered as a complement or even replacement for textbooks in anatomy learning interventions.

While anatomy learning is an essential part of medical education, there remain significant challenges in traditional learning methods, e.g., related to the limited resources for performing dissection/pro-section in large classes, and the learning difficulty in understanding the complexities of the human body and performing proper mental mapping based on two-dimensional (2D) anatomical structures in a textbook.
Recently, advanced technologies, such as 3D visualization and augmented reality (AR), have reshaped anatomy learning.

In this paper, we introduce two in-house anatomy training solutions that can visualize and superimpose 3D virtual anatomy models with informative labels using a hand-held tablet or a wide-screen AR. 
To investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed tablet-based 3D visualization and AR tools, we conducted a large-scale study with \textbf{236} students enrolled in undergraduate premedical programs (95 males, 141 females in 118 dyadic teams).
In this study, participant students were split into three groups to use one of the following learning tools in a team-based anatomy painting activity: (1) conventional textbook, (2) hand-held tablet-based 3D visualization, and (3) screen-based AR.
The results showed that students who used the tablet-based visualization tool or the AR learning tool reported significantly higher (more positive) \expMeasure scores than those who used a textbook.
Though we did not observe a significant difference in knowledge retention among the three learning tools, our further analysis of gender effects revealed that male participants generally reported more positive \expMeasure scores than female participants. Also, the overall experience of mixed-gender dyads was reported to be significantly lower than others in most of the learning experience and performance measures. 
% While discussing the implications of our results in the context of anatomy and medical education, we suggest that tablet-based 3D visualizations and AR learning tools have the potential to be considered as a complement or even replacement for textbooks in anatomy learning interventions.
While discussing the implications of our results in the context of anatomy and medical education, we highlight the potential of our learning tools with additional considerations related to gender and team dynamics in body painting anatomy learning interventions.
