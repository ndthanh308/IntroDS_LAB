  "abstract": "A brief review of the results for the total cross section σ^{νN} of ultrahigh-energy neutrino deep inelastic scattering on isoscalar nuclear targets is presented. These results are based on simple approximations for σ^{νN} and are compared with the experimental data of the IceCube Collaboration. The total cross section σ^{νN} is proportional to the structure function F_2^{νN}(M_V^2/s,M_V^2), where M_V is the intermediate boson mass and s is square of the energy of the center of mass. The coefficient in the front of F_2^{νN}(M_V^2/s,M_V^2) depends on the asymptotic behavior of F_2^{νN} at low values of x. It contains an additional term \\sim \\ln{s} if F_2^{νN} is scaled by the power \\ln(1/x). Therefore, the asymptotic behavior of F_2^{νN}\\propto\\ln^2(1/x) for small x often assumed in the literature already leads to violation of the Froissart bound for σ^{νN}.",
