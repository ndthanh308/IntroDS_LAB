  "abstract": "This work numerically examines the temporal and spectral properties of a quadratic map. The quadratic map described in this study has quadratic non-linearity, and its theoretical analysis poses a challenge. Additionally, this map can be used for a fixed parameter value in chaos-based communication systems. Therefore, it is important to understand and, if possible, control the Power Spectral Density (PSD) generated by its signals. In practical communication systems, the bandwidth is limited, making it crucial to understand the spectral formatting of the employed signals.",
