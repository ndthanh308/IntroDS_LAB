abstract = {Fog computing addresses the issues experienced in Cloud computing such as latency, delay, and bandwidth while provisioning the resources such as computation, storage, and network for IoT applications. Fog resources and their integration with Cloud poses other significant problems such as data security, overhead in data acquisition, data tampering, data privacy, data breach, etc. Designing a secure, resilient, and scalable infrastructure for IoT network is challenging because of resource heterogeneity, resource-constrained devices, and unreliable network connectivity. The researchers have developed many chaos-based encryption algorithms to enhance the security level and make it difficult for intruders to access the data. However, such traditional algorithms increase the communication overhead and computational cost. This necessitates the design of new secure communication protocols that comply with various security requirements of Class of Fog Applications (CoFA). This work proposes an efficient and intelligent method that classifies the applications arriving at the system into CoFA and maps them to five levels of chaos-based security protocols for secure communication. An adaptive sliding mode security schemes are developed using Genesio-Tesi, Modified-Jerk, Chua's chaotic, and Financial systems in CoFA framework for secure communication. A comparison-based performance study, with state-of-art, reveals the efficacy of the proposed method, which performs better for security optimization and synchronization with the least error.}

abstract = {Recently we have developed a simplified recursive adaptive blind channel equalization method for Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) chaotic communication systems. Even though the simplified recursive algorithm gives superior results compared to the state of the art chaotic blind channel equalization algorithms, it has a very important limitation: convergence of the adaptive algorithm is ensured for only Strictly Positive Real (SPR) channels. In this study, we propose a non-recursive chaotic blind channel equalization algorithm that works regardless of whether the channel is SPR or not. First, a statistically optimum fixed filter is designed assuming that the channel is known. Then, it is shown via computer simulations that its performance is very close to that of the statistically optimum fixed filter. Furthermore, it gives better results especially for non-SPR channels compared to the well-known minimum nonlinear prediction error method and the simplified recursive algorithm developed in our previous work. The method is computationally simple and does not impose any restrictions on the channel other than being a finite impulse response filter. Since the instantaneous gradient is used to derive the adaptive algorithm, the proposed method works for slowly and smoothly varying linear channels as well.}

abstract = {Rotating machinery is widely used in various systems of trains, and its health status is directly related to the reliability of train operation. Therefore, the fault diagnosis of train rotating machinery plays a promoting role in the safe operation and maintenance of trains. Due to the influence of track excitation and other equipment vibration, the vibration signal of rotating machinery is non-stationary and nonlinear, which brings challenges to the fault diagnosis of rotating machinery. To solve this problem, an intelligent fault diagnosis method for rotating machinery based on multi-objective variational mode decomposition (VMD) optimization and ensemble learning is proposed. Firstly, an improved multi-verse optimizer (MVO) algorithm is proposed by introducing Tent chaos theory and Levy flight theory, and a multi-objective VMD parameter optimization model is established. The improved MVO algorithm is utilized to optimize the parameters and reconstruct the signal. Then, a multi-domain feature extraction method is proposed for multi-domain fault feature extraction and feature selection. Finally, an adaptive mutation particle swarm optimization random forest (AMPSO-RF) pattern recognition algorithm is proposed for fault pattern recognition. Through the verification of bearing and gear fault data, the results showed that the raised method can accurately realize fault diagnosis of train rotating parts, and the accuracy rate reaches 100%, which is better than the compared methods.}

The performance analysis demonstrate that the 2D-EHLM has significantly better hyperchaotic property, unpredictability characteristics in terms of their Lyapunov exponents, trajectories, and 0-1test in comparison to some existing 2D chaotic maps. Such as the 2D-EHLM performs chaotic behavior when their control parameter μ within (−3,4), which indicates a large chaotic range comparing with other 2D dynamical systems. To investigate its application, this paper proposes a new image confusion strategy based on the two-way Josephus traversing (TJT) to efficiently scramble the color image components and pixel positions. Combining 2D-EHLM and TJT operation, a new color image encryption scheme is proposed. The stimulation experiments and security analysis demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to protect the image information with a high security as well as to resist common types of attacks, which also verify the superior hyperchaotic behaviors of the 2D-EHLM from the aspect of encryption effect.}

abstract = {Cancellable biometrics is the art of generating distorted or encrypted templates of original biometric templates. The evolution of cancellable biometrics is attributed to the advanced hacking technologies that can capture the original stored biometrics from databases. One of the solutions for this problem is to store cancellable biometric templates in the database rather than the original ones. This paper presents a cancellable face recognition scheme that is based on face image encryption with Fractional-Order (FO) Lorenz chaotic system. The basic idea is to generate user-specific random keys to be XORed with the red, green, and blue components of color face images. These keys are generated from the fractional-order Lorenz chaotic system. In addition, some post-processing is implemented on the encrypted color components of the face images with rotation and transposition of matrices. Finally, a wavelet fusion process is applied on these encrypted and processed face image components. The reason behind the utilization of wavelet fusion is to generate a single cancellable template for each color face image. Furthermore, wavelet fusion after post-processing of encrypted color components leads to a better degree of diffusion in the encrypted face templates. Actually, the encryption with the proposed algorithm is not full encryption, but it is appropriate for cancellable biometric applications. Moreover, the proposed scheme is secure due to the power of fractional-order Lorenz chaotic system that is very sensitive to initial conditions selected by the user. In addition, the post-processing incorporated with wavelet fusion is a non-invertible process. The validation of the proposed scheme is performed with experiments on FERET, LFW, and ORL databases. Evaluation metrics including Equal Error Rate (EER), Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (AROC) curve are utilized in the proposed scheme. Numerical values reveal EER levels close to zero and AROC values of 100% at low and mild noise levels.}

The proposed s-box-based post-processing method is applied in real time to a TRNG architecture based on two different digital noise source scenarios such as jitter and metastability on the Altera Cyclone GX FPGA chip. In both scenarios, the statistical quality of raw random numbers that s-box based transformations of 48x32 (48-bit input 32-bit output) are applied in the post-process stage is improved to meet the cryptographic competencies. This contribution of the proposed method has been analyzed and confirmed by statistical test techniques such as bias, entropy, correlation, and uniformity as well as National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) SP 800-22 randomness evaluation tests. In addition to the statistical analysis, the security analysis of the proposed method has been made and a detailed literature comparison of TRNG is presented by measuring the hardware performance parameters for both scenarios. All these analysis results confirm that the proposed method produces functional results for TRNG by providing a better trade-off in terms of design parameters such as security, area-energy consumption, compression rate, simplicity-applicability and hardware cost. The study is significant to showing that s-boxes with strong mathematical encryption features can be used for different cryptographic aims, such as random number generation, outside of the confusion function.}

This novel technique is applied to a large set of video signals for testing and compares its performance with some recently proposed video coding and encryption systems. To test and measure the efficiency and reliability of different encoding and encryption schemes, we consider a set of well-defined quality metrics, e.g., compression ratio, bit rate in compression, PSNR, NPCR, UACI, correlation coefficients, and histogram analysis, and measure the values of those metrics for different encoding and encryption modules.

The chaos theory is used to preserve the information of object's movement and to model uncertainty and nonlinearity of movement in video sequences. The methodology of the algorithm includes three steps. First, adaptive pseudo-orbit data assimilation is applied to estimate the next state by using the previous states of object. Second, the ensemble members of the state are generated to predict multi-step prediction. Then, the likelihood function of members selects candidate patch for target detection using color information. The algorithm significantly reduces the prediction error because of high-order dynamical information of motion and chaotic prediction. To verify the efficiency of the tracker, the tracking algorithm is compared with the stochastic and deterministic methods under two datasets. The results demonstrate that the chaotic-based tracker outperforms other state-of-the-art methods on the abrupt motion, occlusion, and out of view. The algorithm is about two times faster than the particle filter method while the error of particle filter is about two times more than the error of the chaotic-based tracking method.}

In the receiving terminal, unlike the traditional extraction methods, a novel SWT algorithm is introduced to recover information signals correctly. Simulation results verify that both the synchronization approach and the security communication scheme are effective. For multi-component sinusoidal signal with adjacent frequency, the accuracy of signals recovered by SWT is higher than that recovered by empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method, even at the high noise level. Finally, the simulation experiment of the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signal has been carried out, which proves that the proposed scheme based on SWT can reduce the Bit-Error-Rate than other algorithms even under high noise level.}

abstract = {In this paper, an encryption algorithm for gray images using a secret key of 128-bits size is proposed. Initially, visual quality of image is degraded by the mixing process. Resultant image is partitioned into key dependent dynamic blocks and, further, these blocks are passed through key dependent diffusion and substitution processes. Total sixteen rounds are used in the encryption algorithm. Proposed technique is simple to implement and has high encryption rate. Simulation experiment results have been given to validate the high security features and effectiveness of proposed system.}

abstract = {Many communication systems applying synchronism of chaotic systems have been proposed as an alternative spread spectrum modulation that improves the level of privacy in data transmission. However, due to the lack of robustness of chaos synchronization, even minor channel imperfections are enough to hinder communication. In this paper, we propose an adaptive equalization scheme based on a modified normalized least-mean-squares (NLMS) algorithm, which enables chaotic synchronization when the communication channel is not ideal. As an example of application, this scheme is used to recover a binary sequence modulated by a chaotic signal generated by the Hénon map. Simulation results show that the modified NLMS can successfully equalize the channel in different scenarios.}

abstract = {Primary voice production occurs in the larynx through vibrational movements carried out by vocal folds. However, many problems can affect this complex system resulting in voice disorders. In this context, time–frequency–shape analysis based on embedding phase space plots and nonlinear dynamics methods have been used to evaluate the vocal fold dynamics during phonation. For this purpose, the present work used high-speed video to record the vocal fold movements of three subjects and extract the glottal area time series using an image segmentation algorithm. This signal is used for an optimization method which combines genetic algorithms and a quasi-Newton method to optimize the parameters of a biomechanical model of vocal folds based on lumped elements (masses, springs and dampers). After optimization, this model is capable of simulating the dynamics of recorded vocal folds and their glottal pulse. Bifurcation diagrams and phase space analysis were used to evaluate the behavior of this deterministic system in different circumstances. The results showed that this methodology can be used to extract some physiological parameters of vocal folds and reproduce some complex behaviors of these structures contributing to the scientific and clinical evaluation of voice production.}

abstract = {This paper presents a lossy compression technique for encrypted images using Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Huffman coding. The core idea of the proposed technique lies in the selection of significant and less significant coefficients in the wavelet domain. Significant and less significant coefficients are encrypted using pseudo-random number sequence and coefficient permutation respectively. Furthermore, encrypted significant data is compressed by quantization and entropy coding while, less significant encrypted data is efficiently compressed by discarding irrelevant information using SVD and Huffman coding techniques. At receiver side, a reliable decompression and decryption technique is used to reconstruct the original image content with the help of compressed bit streams and secret keys. The performance of proposed technique is evaluated using parameters such as Compression Ratio (CR) and Peak-Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed work over prior work on compression of encrypted images and obtain the compression performance comparable to state of art work on compression of unencrypted images i.e. JPEG standard.}

abstract = {This paper presents a novel secure communication system for digital signal transmissions. It contains four important parts: modulation, chaotic transmitter, chaotic receiver, and demodulation. The modulation mechanism is to modulate each of delivered bit information to be a carrier signal in the continuous form. Then this carrier signal is taken as a parameter of the chaotic system, called the unified chaotic system. Such a system possesses three different types of chaos characterizations depending on its system's parameter, and this guarantees the communication security more. In the public channel, only three chaotic state variables are delivered and this means that the important carrier information is efficiently screened. According to chaotic states received in the receiver terminal, the continuous carrier signal is decrypted using certain adaptation mechanisms. Finally, the proposed demodulation method can successfully recover the original bit information which is embedded in the communication systems. Some simulation results are provided to verify the efficiency of the proposed secure communication system.}

First, using the variable structure control (VSC) technique, we propose a control law to cope with the synchronization problem of the master and slave Sprott circuits. Then, according to the concept of equivalence control, it can ensure that the message embedded in the transmitter (master Sprott circuit) can be recovered in the receiver (slave Sprott circuit). Then a digital secure communication system based on synchronized coupled chaotic systems is implemented using basic electronic components. Finally, both simulation results and the experimental results demonstrate the proposed VSC-based synchronization scheme's success in the secure communication application.}

abstract = {Epilepsy represents chaos in nerves which can affect the world's population. Such type of abnormal activities of the brain can lead to seizures. Hence, precise and timely treatment of seizures is important to minimize financial and living costs. Electroencephalogram (EEG) is considered an imperative tool for analyzing epilepsy to diagnose epilepsy. This paper devises an optimization-aware deep model for detecting epilepsy using EEG signals. Here, the EEG signals undergo feature extraction wherein several features like relative amplitude, spectral entropy, logarithmic band power, power spectral density, Multiple kernel weighted Mel frequency cepstral coefficient (MKMFCC), tonal power ratio. The proposed weighted one-dimensional Local Binary Pattern (1D LBP) is obtained by combining weighted function in 1D-LBP are extracted. After extraction of features, data augmentation is carried out by flipping the EEG signal with the circular shift. The training of the Deep Maxout network is trained is done by the devised Taylor Henry gas solubility optimization (Taylor HGSO), by merging the Taylor Series and HGSO. The developed Taylor HGSO-based Deep Maxout network offered enhanced performance with high accuracy of 93.6%, sensitivity of 94.7%, and specificity of 93.4%.}
