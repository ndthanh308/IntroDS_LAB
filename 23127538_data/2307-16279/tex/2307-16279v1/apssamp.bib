abstract = {Let A and B be Hermitian matrices, and let c(A, B) = inf{|xH(A + iB)x|:‖ = 1}. The eigenvalue problem Ax = λBx is called definite if c(A, B)>0. It is shown that a definite problem has a complete system of eigenvectors and that its eigenvalues are real. Under pertubations of A and B, the eigenvalues behave like the eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix in the sense that there is a 1-1 pairing of the eigenvalues with the perturbed eigenvalues and a uniform bound for their differences (in this case in the chordal metric). Pertubation bounds are also developed for eigenvectors and eigenspaces.}

    abstract = { Quantum subspace diagonalization methods are an exciting new class of algorithms for solving large-scale eigenvalue problems using quantum computers. Unfortunately, these methods require the solution of an ill-conditioned generalized eigenvalue problem, with a matrix pencil corrupted by a nonnegligible amount of noise that is far above the machine precision. Despite pessimistic predictions from classical worst-case perturbation theories, these methods can perform reliably well if the generalized eigenvalue problem is solved using a standard truncation strategy. By leveraging and advancing classical results in matrix perturbation theory, we provide a theoretical analysis of this surprising phenomenon, proving that under certain natural conditions, a quantum subspace diagonalization algorithm can accurately compute the smallest eigenvalue of a large Hermitian matrix. We give numerical experiments demonstrating the effectiveness of the theory and providing practical guidance for the choice of truncation level. Our new results can also be of independent interest to solving eigenvalue problems outside the context of quantum computation. }

 abstract = {Theoretical error bounds are established, improving those given by S. Kaniel. Similar inequalities are found for the eigenvectors by using bounds on the acute angle between the exact eigenvectors and the Krylov subspace spanned by x0, Ax0, ⋯, An-1x0, where x0 is the initial vector of the process. All the results obtained are then extended to the block-Lanczos method, and it is shown that the bounds on the rates of the Block version are superior to those of the single vector process. The difference between the two methods is in many respects similar to the difference between the simultaneous iteration method and the single vector power method. Several numerical experiments are described in order to compare the actual rates of convergence with the theoretical bounds.},

Popular versions are variational quantum eigensolvers and quantum approximate optimization algorithms that solve ground state problems from quantum chemistry and binary optimization problems, respectively. They are based on the idea of using a classical computer to train a parametrized quantum circuit. We show that the corresponding classical optimization problems are NP-hard. Moreover, the hardness is robust in the sense that, for every polynomial time algorithm, there are instances for which the relative error resulting from the classical optimization problem can be arbitrarily large assuming that P≠NP. Even for classically tractable systems composed of only logarithmically many qubits or free fermions, we show the optimization to be NP-hard. This elucidates that the classical optimization is intrinsically hard and does not merely inherit the hardness from the ground state problem. Our analysis shows that the training landscape can have many far from optimal persistent local minima This means gradient and higher order descent algorithms will generally converge to far from optimal solutions.}},

Quantum computers promise a solution, although fault-tolerant quantum computers will probably not be available in the near future. Current quantum devices have serious constraints, including limited numbers of qubits and noise processes that limit circuit depth. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which use a classical optimizer to train a parameterized quantum circuit, have emerged as a leading strategy to address these constraints. VQAs have now been proposed for essentially all applications that researchers have envisaged for quantum computers, and they appear to be the best hope for obtaining quantum advantage. Nevertheless, challenges remain, including the trainability, accuracy and efficiency of VQAs. Here we overview the field of VQAs, discuss strategies to overcome their challenges and highlight the exciting prospects for using them to obtain quantum advantage. The advent of commercial quantum devices has ushered in the era of near-term quantum computing. Variational quantum algorithms are promising candidates to make use of these devices for achieving a practical quantum advantage over classical computers.

The quantum phase estimation algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ansätze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry—calculating the ground-state molecular energy for He–H+. The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future.}},

The algorithm depends on a positive integer p and the quality of the approximation improves as p is increased. The quantum circuit that implements the algorithm consists of unitary gates whose locality is at most the locality of the objective function whose optimum is sought. The depth of the circuit grows linearly with p times (at worst) the number of constraints. If p is fixed, that is, independent of the input size, the algorithm makes use of efficient classical preprocessing. If p grows with the input size a different strategy is proposed. We study the algorithm as applied to MaxCut on regular graphs and analyze its performance on 2-regular and 3-regular graphs for fixed p. For p = 1, on 3-regular graphs the quantum algorithm always finds a cut that is at least 0.6924 times the size of the optimal cut.}},

In particular, we explore the use of a novel sparse “compressed” double factorization (C-DF) truncation of the Hamiltonian within the time-propagation elements of QFD, while retaining a similarly compressed but numerically converged double-factorized representation of the Hamiltonian for the operator expectation values needed in the QFD quantum matrix elements. The new C-DF method is found to provide substantial additional compression at any given accuracy metric over the traditional “explicit” double factorization approach. Together with significant circuit reduction optimizations and number-preserving postselection and echo-sequencing error mitigation strategies, the method is found to provide accurate predictions for low-lying eigenspectra in a number of representative molecular systems, while requiring reasonably short circuit depths and modest measurement costs. The method is demonstrated by experiments on noise-free simulators, simulations including models of decoherence and shot-noise, and real quantum hardware.}},

While the vast majority of QSD algorithms have focused on solving the eigenpair problem for ground-state, excited-state, and thermal observable estimations, there has been a lot less work in considering QSD algorithms for the problem of quantum dynamical simulation. In this work, we propose several quantum Krylov fast-forwarding algorithms capable of predicting long-time dynamics well beyond the coherence time of current quantum hardware. Our algorithms use real-time evolved Krylov basis states prepared on a quantum computer and a multireference subspace method to ensure convergence towards high-fidelity, long-time dynamics. In particular, we show that the proposed multireference methodology provides a systematic way of trading off circuit depth with classical postprocessing complexity. We also demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through numerical implementations for several quantum chemistry problems, including the calculation of the autocorrelation and dipole moment correlation functions.}},

abstract = {{Quantum computers provide new avenues to access ground and excited state properties of systems otherwise difficult to simulate on classical hardware. New approaches using subspaces generated by real-time evolution have shown efficiency in extracting eigenstate information, but the full capabilities of such approaches are still not understood. In recent work, we developed the variational quantum phase estimation (VQPE) method, a compact and efficient real-time algorithm to extract eigenvalues on quantum hardware. Here we build on that work by theoretically and numerically exploring a generalized Krylov scheme where the Krylov subspace is constructed through a parametrized real-time evolution, which applies to the VQPE algorithm as well as others. We establish an error bound that justifies the fast convergence of our spectral approximation. We also derive how the overlap with high energy eigenstates becomes suppressed from real-time subspace diagonalization and we visualize the process that shows the signature phase cancellations at specific eigenenergies. We investigate various algorithm implementations and consider performance when stochasticity is added to the target Hamiltonian in the form of spectral statistics. To demonstrate the practicality of such real-time evolution, we discuss its application to fundamental problems in quantum computation such as electronic structure predictions for strongly correlated systems.}},

abstract = {{Many experimental proposals for noisy intermediate scale quantum devices involve training a parameterized quantum circuit with a classical optimization loop. Such hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are popular for applications in quantum simulation, optimization, and machine learning. Due to its simplicity and hardware efficiency, random circuits are often proposed as initial guesses for exploring the space of quantum states. We show that the exponential dimension of Hilbert space and the gradient estimation complexity make this choice unsuitable for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms run on more than a few qubits. Specifically, we show that for a wide class of reasonable parameterized quantum circuits, the probability that the gradient along any reasonable direction is non-zero to some fixed precision is exponentially small as a function of the number of qubits. We argue that this is related to the 2-design characteristic of random circuits, and that solutions to this problem must be studied. Gradient-based hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are often initialised with random, unstructured guesses. Here, the authors show that this approach will fail in the long run, due to the exponentially-small probability of finding a large enough gradient along any direction.}},

While VQAs may enable practical applications of noisy quantum computers, they are nevertheless heuristic methods with unproven scaling. Here, we rigorously prove two results, assuming V(θ) is an alternating layered ansatz composed of blocks forming local 2-designs. Our first result states that defining C in terms of global observables leads to exponentially vanishing gradients (i.e., barren plateaus) even when V(θ) is shallow. Hence, several VQAs in the literature must revise their proposed costs. On the other hand, our second result states that defining C with local observables leads to at worst a polynomially vanishing gradient, so long as the depth of V(θ) is O(logn). Our results establish a connection between locality and trainability. We illustrate these ideas with large-scale simulations, up to 100 qubits, of a quantum autoencoder implementation. Parametrised quantum circuits are a promising hybrid classical-quantum approach, but rigorous results on their effective capabilities are rare. Here, the authors explore the feasibility of training depending on the type of cost functions, showing that local ones are less prone to the barren plateau problem.}},
