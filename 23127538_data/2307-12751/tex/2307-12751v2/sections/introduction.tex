\section{Introduction}\label{sec:introduction}
%
Single image super-resolution~(SISR) as a fundamental vision problem is a procedure to reconstruct a super-resolution~(SR) image from a single low-resolution~(LR) image. 
%
SISR is an active research topic and has attracted increasing attention in low-level computer vision. 
%
It has many applications in various fields such as medical imaging \cite{greenspan2001mri, peled2001superresolution}, face recognition \cite{gunturk2003eigenface, wheeler2007multi}, satellite image processing \cite{li2015sub, tatem2002super} and security video surveillance \cite{lin2005investigation, zhang2010super}. 
%
Recent state-of-the-art~(SOTA) SR methods have achieved remarkable progress due to the development of deep convolutional neural networks~(CNNs).
%
They are usually trained on synthetic inputs in a fully-supervised fashion where LR images are generated by bicubic down-sampling from their HR counterparts.

%
Nevertheless, models trained on the synthetic datasets cannot generalize well when applied to real-world inputs~\cite{chen2019camera, cai2019toward}.
%
Another problem is that acquiring well-constructed LR-HR pairs from the real world is very challenging due to cost problems or hardware limitations~\cite{chen2019camera, cai2019toward, sr_zllz}.
%
Therefore, it is a common scenario that we have LR images only rather than having LR-HR training pairs.
%
Several approaches adopt unsupervised adversarial training~\cite{goodfellow2014generative} and leverage unpaired LR-HR images to alleviate the situation.
%
By jointly training down-sampling and up-sampling networks~\cite{yuan2018unsupervised, sr_deg, sr_gandeg, sr_unpaired_pesudo, sr_unsupervised}, those methods aim to generate synthetic LR images that have similar characteristics of given unpaired LR examples.
%
Then, the synthesized training pairs can be leveraged to optimize the up-sampling network.
%
However, such unsupervised strategies require appropriate HR images, even though those images are not paired with the given LR images.
%
Also, Son~\etal~\cite{son2021toward} have identified that those methods are biased toward some handcrafted functions \eg, nearest or bicubic interpolation, which limits the generalization.
%

In this paper, we present a novel self-supervised real-world SR framework, ICF-SRSR, to overcome the aforementioned challenges.
%
To this end, we first propose a concept of Invertible scale-Conditional Function~(ICF).
%
It is designed to perform up-sampling and down-sampling within a single model, conditioned by the scale arguments $s$ and $\nicefrac{1}{s}$, respectively.
%
Therefore, we can resize an input by a given scale $s$ and restore the initial input by taking the inverse scale $\nicefrac{1}{s}$.
%
Without utilizing paired/unpaired training images nor any specific down-sampling operator \eg, bicubic, ICF-SRSR containing a learnable ICF can be trained in a fully self-supervised manner.
%
Moreover, our method can generate realistic LR-HR image pairs from a set of given images useful for training the other off-the-shelf methods.
%
In the experiments, we demonstrate the ability of our ICF-SRSR to learn from real-world datasets, restore high-/lower-resolution images, and evaluate our method on other datasets in a self-supervised manner.
%
Our main contributions are threefold:
%
\begin{itemize}
    %
    \item Our ICF-SRSR is a self-supervised framework for the SISR task that performs simultaneous SR and down-sampling based on the proposed ICF.
    %
    \item Our ICF-SRSR can learn a feasible resizing function directly from real-world LR images.
    %
    Our self-supervised approach performs better on real-world SR than existing methods trained on synthetic datasets, even with training on a single image, as evident in \cref{fig:zero-shot}.
    %
    \item Our ICF-SRSR can also down-sample given natural images, which enables us to construct realistic training pairs.
    %
    Therefore, we can train off-the-shelf SR methods using the generated pairs by our ICF-SRSR in the absence of real paired training samples.
