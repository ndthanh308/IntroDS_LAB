  Single image super-resolution~(SISR) is a challenging ill-posed problem that aims to up-sample a given low-resolution~(LR) image to a high-resolution~(HR) counterpart. 
 %
 Due to the difficulty in obtaining real LR-HR training pairs, recent approaches are trained on simulated LR images degraded by simplified down-sampling operators, \eg, bicubic.
 %
 Such an approach can be problematic in practice because of the large gap between the synthesized and real-world LR images.
 %
 To alleviate the issue, we propose a novel Invertible scale-Conditional Function~(ICF), which can scale an input image and then restore the original input with different scale conditions.
 %
 By leveraging the proposed ICF, we construct a novel self-supervised SISR framework~(ICF-SRSR) to handle the real-world SR task without using any paired/unpaired training data.
 %
 Furthermore, our ICF-SRSR can generate realistic and feasible LR-HR pairs, which can make existing supervised SISR networks more robust.
 %
 Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in handling SISR in a fully self-supervised manner.
 %
 Our ICF-SRSR demonstrates superior performance compared to the existing methods trained on synthetic paired images in real-world scenarios and exhibits comparable performance compared to state-of-the-art supervised/unsupervised methods on public benchmark datasets.
