\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We propose ICF, a novel invertible scale-conditional function that receives an image and an arbitrary scaling factor and generates the resized image, and can reconstruct the same input image by the given resized image and the inverse scaling factor. 
%
Then, we utilize ICF to design a self-supervised real-world single-image super-resolution framework ICF-SRSR. 
%
Accordingly, our framework is able to generate up-sampled and down-sampled images simultaneously, where the generated down-sampled images can be used to construct paired images appropriate for training existing models.
%
Extensive experiments demonstrate the strengths of our self-supervised method on both synthetic and real-world datasets and superior performance on the real-world dataset compared to supervised models trained on the synthetic datasets.
%

\Paragraph{Limitations and future works.}
One remaining limitation is that we only apply our method to a few real-world datasets due to the lack of aligned LR-HR image pairs for evaluation in other real-world datasets.
%
Therefore, we aim to provide a large-scale real-world dataset from various scenes for better evaluation in our future work.
%
Moreover, we will investigate the applications of our defined ICF to self-supervised image warping and other image restoration tasks.
