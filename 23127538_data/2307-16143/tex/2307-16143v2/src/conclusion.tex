\section{Conclusion}
This paper proposes MaskGAN - a novel automated framework that maintains the shape consistency of prominent anatomical structures without relying on expert annotated segmentations. Our method generates a coarse mask outlining the shape of the main anatomy and synthesizes the contents for the masked foreground region. Experimental results on a clinical dataset show that MaskGAN significantly outperforms existing methods and produces synthetic CT with more consistent mappings of anatomical structures.
