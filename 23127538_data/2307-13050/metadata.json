  "abstract": "We use a novel method to constrain the neutrino magnetic dipole moment ($μ_ν$) using the empirically-calibrated tip of the red giant branch I-band magnitude that fully accounts for uncertainties in stellar physics. Our method uses machine learning to emulate the results of stellar evolution codes. This reduces the I-Band magnitude computation time to milliseconds, which enables a Bayesian statistical analysis where $μ_ν$ is varied simultaneously with the stellar physics, allowing for a complete exploration of parameter space. We find the region $μ_ν \\leq 6\\times10^{-12}μ_{\\textrm{B}}$ (with $μ_{\\textrm{B}}$ the Bohr magneton), previously believed to be excluded, is unconstrained after accounting for degeneracies with stellar physics. It is likely that larger values are similarly unconstrained. We discuss the implications of our results for future neutrino magnetic dipole moment searches and for other astrophysical probes.",
