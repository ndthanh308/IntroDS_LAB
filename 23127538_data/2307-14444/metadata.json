  "abstract": "Catalyst impregnation is one of the most crucial steps for preparing industrial catalysts. The inter-particle variability of the impregnated liquid inside the particles significantly affects the activity and selectivity of the catalyst. Current scale-up practices lead to poor fluid distribution and inhomogeneity in the liquid content. This work aims to understand the dynamic behavior of the particles under the spray nozzle and to develop a scale-up model for dry impregnation processes. We considered five dimensionless numbers in the scaling analysis. We performed Discrete Element Method simulations and experiments of dry impregnation inside porous particles for different vessel sizes. The water content of the particles was compared for other times locations, and the relative standard deviation (RSD) was calculated from the axial water content. Simulation and experimental results show excellent agreement, confirming that the scale-up rules apply to all vessel sizes.",
