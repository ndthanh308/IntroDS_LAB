  "abstract": "This paper is devoted to studying time decay estimates of the solution for Beam equation (higher order type wave equation) with a potential\n  $$u_{t t}+\\big(Δ^2+V\\big)u=0, \\,\\ u(0, x)=f(x),\\ u_{t}(0, x)=g(x)$$ in dimension three, where $V$ is a real-valued and decaying potential on $\\R^3$. Assume that zero is a regular point of $H:= Δ^2+V $, we first prove the following optimal time decay estimates of the solution operators \\begin{equation*}\n  \\big\\|\\cos (t\\sqrt{H})P_{ac}(H)\\big\\|_{L^{1} \\rightarrow L^{\\infty}} \\lesssim|t|^{-\\frac{3}{2}}\\ \\ \\hbox{and} \\ \\\n  \\Big\\|\\frac{\\sin(t\\sqrt{H})}{\\sqrt{H}} P_{a c}(H)\\Big\\|_{L^{1} \\rightarrow L^{\\infty}} \\lesssim|t|^{-\\frac{1}{2}}. \\end{equation*} Moreover, if zero is a resonance of $H$, then time decay of the solution operators above also are considered. It is noticed that the first kind resonance does not effect the decay rates for the propagator operators $\\cos(t\\sqrt{H})$ and $\\frac{\\sin(t\\sqrt{H})}{\\sqrt{H}}$, but their decay will be dramatically changed for the second and third resonance types.",
