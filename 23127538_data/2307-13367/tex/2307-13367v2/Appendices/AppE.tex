\section{Some interesting posteriors}\label{AppE}

Fig.~\ref{fig:MCMC2} shows posteriors for intrinsic parameters for injected MBHB parameters $M_z=10^5~\MSun$, $q=8.0$, and $e_{1{\rm yr}}=10^{-2.75}$, a system that is motivated astrophysically by the binary's interaction with its environment. While the mass and the mass ratio are still well-measured as in Fig.~\ref{fig:MCMC} due to similar SNR, eccentricity posterior is broad. Nonetheless, the peak of the eccentricity posterior is very close to the injected value.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:MCMC_all}, we show posteriors for all parameters given in Table~\ref{table:parameters} for an injected binary with $M_z=10^5~\MSun$, $q=8.0$, and $e_{1{\rm yr}}=0.01$ and the extrinsic parameters set to our fiducial values. Comparison with posteriors when only varying intrinsic parameters suggest that while $M_z$ and $q$ are about order-of-magnitude less constrained, eccentricity is almost not affected due to the inclusion of extrinsic parameters, supporting inference from Fig.~\ref{fig:Violin_ecc}. As expected, there is a degeneracy between the inclination ($\imath$) and the luminosity distance ($D_{\rm L}$). The phase at coalescence ($\phi$) and the polarization angle ($\psi$) have multi-modality due to periodic functions and hence their injected values are not recovered robustly. The ecliptic latitude ($\lambda$) and longitude ($\beta$) exhibit slight degeneracies with $D_{\rm L}$ but are well constrained.
