\section{Dependence on high-frequency cutoff}\label{AppC}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:MCMC_cutoff}, we compare posteriors between two signals, where the high-frequency cutoff is at $10\,r_{\rm s}$ and at our fiducial cutoff $3\,r_{\rm s}$. This exercise is performed to ensure that near-merger artefacts, beyond the scope of \textsc{TaylorF2Ecc}, do not bias our results. Almost overlapping posteriors indeed illustrate that the cutoff near the merger does not affect the recovery of parameters, especially eccentricity, which is an early inspiral effect.
