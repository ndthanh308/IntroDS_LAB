\section{Dependence on Fisher initialized prior's covariance}\label{AppD}

In Fig.~\ref{fig:Wider_prior}, we make a comparison between two posteriors with prior's covariances either the same as our fiducial Fisher covariances or twice the Fisher covariances. Almost identical posteriors clearly illustrate that our Bayesian runs are giving informative results and not merely giving back the Fisher priors we are using.
