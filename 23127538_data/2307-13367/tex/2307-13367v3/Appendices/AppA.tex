\section{Circularization test for \textsc{TaylorF2Ecc}}\label{AppA}

To check that the \textsc{TaylorF2Ecc} template is well-behaved, i.e. $\tilde{h}_{\rm ecc}$ converges to $\tilde{h}_{\rm cir}$ as the system approaches the coalescence, we compute tidal matches: we divide a signal into equal frequency bins and compute the mismatch (i.e. $1-\mathscr{M}(h_{\rm cir},h_{\rm ecc})$) with respect to the cumulative frequency. In Fig.~\ref{fig:tidalmismatch}, we show the evolution of the mismatch as a function of cumulative frequency for three total masses -- $\{10^5,~10^6,~\text{and}~10^7\}~\MSun$ -- with fixed $q=8.0$ and $e_{1{\rm yr}}=0.1$ over 20 frequency bins between $f_{1\rm yr}$ and $f_{\rm ISCO}$. The figure indeed shows that the mismatch is decreasing as the MBHB approaches its ISCO, showing that \textsc{TaylorF2Ecc} is well-behaved.
