@article{Biernacki:AbstractingAlgEffects,
	abstract = {Proposed originally by Plotkin and Pretnar, algebraic effects and their handlers are a leading-edge approach to computational effects: exceptions, mutable state, nondeterminism, and such. Appreciated for their elegance and expressiveness, they are now progressing into mainstream functional programming languages. In this paper, we introduce and examine programming language constructs that back adoption of programming with algebraic effects on a larger scale in a modular fashion by providing mechanisms for abstraction. We propose two such mechanisms: existential effects (which hide the details of a particular effect from the user) and local effects (which guarantee that no code coming from the outside can interfere with a given effect). The main technical difficulty arises from the dynamic nature of coupling an effectful operation with the right handler during execution, but, as we show in this paper, a carefully designed type system can ensure that this will not break the abstraction. Our main contribution is a novel calculus for algebraic effects and handlers, called λHEL, equipped with local and existential algebraic effects, in which the dynamic nature of handlers is kept in check by typed runtime coercions. As a proof of concept, we present an experimental programming language based on our calculus, which provides strong abstraction mechanisms via an ML-style module system.},

@article{Milner:PiCalculus,
	abstract = {We present the π-calculus, a calculus of communicating systems in which one can naturally express processes which have changing structure. Not only may the component agents of a system be arbitrarily linked, but a communication between neighbours may carry information which changes that linkage. The calculus is an extension of the process algebra CCS, following work by Engberg and Nielsen, who added mobility to CCS while preserving its algebraic properties. The π-calculus gains simplicity by removing all distinction between variables and constants; communication links are identified by names, and computation is represented purely as the communication of names across links. After an illustrated description of how the π-calculus generalises conventional process algebras in treating mobility, several examples exploiting mobility are given in some detail. The important examples are the encoding into the π-calculus of higher-order functions (the λ-calculus and combinatory algebra), the transmission of processes as values, and the representation of data structures as processes. The paper continues by presenting the algebraic theory of strong bisimilarity and strong equivalence, including a new notion of equivalence indexed by distinctions---i.e., assumptions of inequality among names. These theories are based upon a semantics in terms of a labeled transition system and a notion of strong bisimulation, both of which are expounded in detail in a companion paper. We also report briefly on work-in-progress based upon the corresponding notion of weak bisimulation, in which internal actions cannot be observed.},

The keys to our approach are (1) an adaptation of subject reduction theorems from combinatory logic to programming languages, and (2) the use of rewriting techniques for the specification of the language semantics. The approach easily extends from polymorphic functional languages to imperative languages that provide references, exceptions, continuations, and similar features. We illustrate the technique with a type soundness theorem for the core of Standard ML, which includes the first type soundness proof for polymorphic exceptions and continuations.},

@inproceedings{Dolan:MulticoreOCaml,

While several prototype implementations of languages incorporating algebraic effects exist, Multicore OCaml incorporates effect handlers as the primary means of expressing concurrency in the language. In this paper, we make the observation that effect handlers can elegantly express particularly difficult programs that combine system programming and concurrency without compromising performance. Our experimental results on a highly concurrent and scalable web server demonstrate that effect handlers perform on par with highly optimised monadic concurrency libraries, while retaining the simplicity of direct-style code.},
