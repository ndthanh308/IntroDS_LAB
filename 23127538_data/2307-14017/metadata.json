  "abstract": "Quantum memories integrated into nanophotonic silicon devices are a promising platform for large quantum networks and scalable photonic quantum computers. In this context, erbium dopants are particularly attractive, as they combine optical transitions in the telecommunications frequency band with the potential for second-long coherence time. Here we show that these emitters can be reliably integrated into commercially fabricated low-loss waveguides. We investigate several integration procedures and obtain ensembles of many emitters with an inhomogeneous broadening of < 2 GHz and a homogeneous linewidth of < 30 kHz. We further observe the splitting of the electronic spin states in a magnetic field up to 9 T that freezes paramagnetic impurities. Our findings are an important step towards long-lived quantum memories that can be fabricated on a wafer-scale using CMOS technology.",
