  "abstract": "We study injective endomorphisms of the semigroup $\\boldsymbol{B}_ω^{\\mathscr{F}}$ with the two-elements family $\\mathscr{F}$ of inductive nonempty subsets of $ω$. We describe the elements of the semigroup $\\boldsymbol{End}^1_*(\\boldsymbol{B}_ω^{\\mathscr{F}})$ of all injective monoid endomorphisms of the monoid $\\boldsymbol{B}_ω^{\\mathscr{F}}$, and show that Green's relations $\\mathscr{R}$, $\\mathscr{L}$, $\\mathscr{H}$, $\\mathscr{D}$, and $\\mathscr{J}$ on $\\boldsymbol{End}^1_*(\\boldsymbol{B}_ω^{\\mathscr{F}})$ coincide with the relation of equality.",
