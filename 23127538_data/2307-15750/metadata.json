  "abstract": "The authors of this article intend to present some results obtained in the study of biderivations of complete Lie algebras. Firstly they present a matricial approach to do this, which was a useful and explanatory tool not only in the study of biderivations but also in the synthesis of these results. Then they study all biderivations of a Lie algebra $L$ with $\\operatorname{Z}(L)=0$ and $\\operatorname{Der(L)}=\\operatorname{ad(L)}$, called complete. Moreover, as an application of the previous result, they describe all biderivations of a semisimple Lie algebra (that are complete), extending a result obtained by X. Tang in ([20]) that describes all biderivations of a complex simple Lie algebra. And thirdly, results on symmetric and skew-symmetric biderivations are also presented.",
