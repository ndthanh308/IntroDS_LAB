  "abstract": "Asymptotically exact solutions are obtained for a spherically symmetric field with the Higgs potential generated by a point scalar charge, and a method for numerical integration of the equation for a scalar field with the Higgs potential of a point charge is proposed. Examples of numerical modeling of the equation of the scalar field of a single charge are given. With the help of the solution obtained, solutions of the relativistic equations of motion of a scalar charge in an external scalar field of the Higgs type of a singular scalar source are found and some unique properties of the interparticle scalar interaction are revealed.",
