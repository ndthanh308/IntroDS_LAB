  "abstract": "We consider isomorphism between the idempotent measure monad based on the maximum and the addition operations and the idempotent measure monad based on the maximum and the multiplication operations. A one of the consequences of this result is the construction of a fuzzy integral based on the maximum and the addition operation. We also investigate convexities related to these monads.",
