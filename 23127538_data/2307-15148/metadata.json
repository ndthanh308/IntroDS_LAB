  "abstract": "In this paper we prove the conjecture claiming that, over a flexible field, isotropic Chow groups coincide with numerical Chow groups (with ${\\Bbb{F}}_p$-coefficients). This shows that Isotropic Chow motives coincide with Numerical Chow motives. In particular, homs between such objects are finite groups and $\\otimes$ has no zero-divisors. It provides a large supply of new points for the Balmer spectrum of the Voevodsky motivic category. We also prove the Morava K-theory version of the above result, which permits to construct plenty of new points for the Balmer spectrum of the Morel-Voevodsky ${\\Bbb{A}}^1$-stable homotopic category. This substantially improves our understanding of the mentioned spectra whose description is a major open problem.",
