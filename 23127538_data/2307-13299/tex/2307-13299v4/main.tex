\begin{abstract}
     In this paper, we propose novel mixed-integer linear programming (MIP) formulations to model decision problems posed as influence diagrams. We also present a novel heuristic that can be employed to warm start the MIP solver, as well as provide heuristic solutions to more computationally challenging problems. 
    %All of those improvements are implemented in  \texttt{DecisionProgramming.jl}, a new Julia package for modelling decision problems as MIP equivalents using the proposed formulations. 
    We provide computational results showcasing the superior performance of these improved formulations as well as the performance of the proposed heuristic. Lastly, we describe a novel case study showcasing decision programming as an alternative framework for modelling multi-stage stochastic dynamic programming problems.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

We are enormously grateful for the input from Juho Andelmin, whose initial implementations led to the development of \texttt{DecisionProgramming.jl}. We are also grateful for the contributions of a number of graduate and undergraduate students to the development of the package, as well as to the welcoming and supportive JuMP community. We also gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Research Council of Finland (decision number 332180). Finally, the computational experiments were performed using computer resources within the Aalto University School of Science “Science-IT” project.
