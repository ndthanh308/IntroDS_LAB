\section{Conclusions} \label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper, we have presented improvements to decision programming \citep{salo2022}, and \texttt{DecisionProgramming.jl}, a Julia package that allows representing decision problems as MIP models. We expand on the ideas originally proposed in \citet{salo2022} by providing not only a computational user interface for modeling such problems but also by providing multiple methodological enhancements. These enhancements include a novel and more efficient formulation, valid bounds to tighten relaxations, and a heuristic which can be used to find feasible solutions and, consequently, to warm start the MIP solver.

We have also conducted a novel case study based on the study originally proposed by \citet{hynninen2019value}. Our objective is to demonstrate that our package can be used in settings which would normally require resorting to more ad-hoc computational tools and that it lends itself to be a general and accessible tool for practitioners. We believe that this intuitive and accessible interface, combined with the state-of-the-art mathematical programming modeling package such as JuMP.jl, will allow for a much wider range of practitioners and researchers to have access to mathematical optimization-based tools for supporting decision-making. Furthermore, this will create novel inroads for the use of mathematical optimization in the area of decision analysis at large, potentially unveiling new and promising directions for future developments.

In terms of alternative further developments, we see several directions that deserve further investigation. First, decision programming as a modeling framework is still in its infancy, and, consequently, many obstacles are still to be overcome for its widespread adoption. One of these obstacles is computational requirements. Decision programming models grow large as the number of nodes and/or states increase, and thus, would greatly benefit from alternative ideas that can tackle such large-scale problems. These can be, for example, related to alternative formulations that convert the influence diagram into an intermediate structure and employ ideas from Bayesian inference to yield a more compact MIP model (see \citet{parmentier2020integer}). Another direction worth exploring is the employment of decomposition methods, in particular, those which allow for a delayed generation of structural elements of the model, in our case the paths $s \in S$ (see Section \ref{sec:decision_programming}). Another interesting avenue would be to pursue methods that can reap benefits from employing parallelization, given the increasing availability of high-performance computing clusters.
