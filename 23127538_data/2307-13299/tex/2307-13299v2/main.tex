\begin{abstract}
    We present \texttt{DecisionProgramming.jl}, a new Julia package for modelling decision problems as mixed-integer programming (MIP) equivalents. The package allows the user to pose decision problems as influence diagrams which are then automatically converted to an equivalent MIP formulation. This MIP formulation is implemented using \texttt{JuMP.jl}, a Julia package providing an algebraic syntax for formulating mathematical programming problems. In this paper, we show novel MIP formulations used in the package, which considerably improve the computational performance of the MIP solver. We also present a novel heuristic that can be employed to warm start the solution, as well as provide heuristic solutions to more computationally challenging problems. Lastly, we describe a novel case study showcasing decision programming as an alternative framework for modelling multi-stage stochastic dynamic programming problems.

\section*{Acknowledgements}

We are enormously grateful for the input from Juho Andelmin, whose initial implementations led to the development of \texttt{DecisionProgramming.jl}. We are also grateful for the contributions of a number of graduate and undergraduate students to the development of the package, as well as to the welcoming and supportive JuMP community. We also gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the Research Council of Finland (decision number 332180). Finally, the computational experiments were performed using computer resources within the Aalto University School of Science “Science-IT” project.
