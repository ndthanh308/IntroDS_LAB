\begin{abstract}
In this work, we investigate the extreme value statistics of a one-dimensional Brownian motion (with the diffusion constant $D$) during a time interval $\left[0, t \right]$ in the presence of a reflective boundary at the origin, when starting from a positive position $x_0$. By deriving the survival probability of the Brownian particle without hitting an absorbing boundary at $x=M$, we obtain the distribution $P(M|x_0,t)$ of the maximum displacement $M$ and its expectation $\langle M \rangle$. In the short-time limit, i.e., $t \ll t_d$ where $t_d=x_0^2/D$ is the diffusion time from the starting position $x_0$ to the reflective boundary at the origin, the particle behaves like a free Brownian motion without any boundaries. In the long-time limit, $t \gg t_d$, $\langle M \rangle$ grows with $t$ as $\langle M \rangle \sim \sqrt{t}$, which is similar to the free Brownian motion, but the prefactor is $\pi/2$ times of the free Brownian motion, embodying the effect of the reflective boundary. By solving the propagator and using a path decomposition technique, we obtain the joint distribution $P(M,t_m|x_0,t)$ of $M$ and the time $t_m$ at which this maximum is achieved, from which the marginal distribution $P(t_m|x_0,t)$ is also obtained. For $t \ll t_d$, $P(t_m|x_0,t)$ looks like a U-shaped attributed to the arcsine law of free Brownian motion. For $t$ equal to or larger than order of magnitude of $t_m$, $P(t_m|x_0,t)$ deviates from the U-shaped distribution and becomes asymmetric with respect to $t/2$. Moreover, we compute
the expectation $\langle t_m \rangle$ of $t_m$, and find that $\langle t_m \rangle/t$ is an increasing function of $t$. In two limiting cases, $\langle t_m \rangle/t \to 1/2$ for $t \ll t_d$ and $\langle t_m \rangle/t  \to (1+2G)/4 \approx 0.708$ for $t \gg t_d$, where $G\approx0.916$ is the Catalan's constant. All the theoretical results are validated by numerical simulations.

\section{Introduction}
Despite infrequent occurrences, extreme events are of vital importance as they may bring devastating consequences. Examples include natural calamities, such as earthquake, tsunamis and floods, economic collapses, and outbreak of pandemic  \cite{fisher1928limiting,gumbel1958statistics,leadbetter2012extremes,bouchaud1997universality,davison2015statistics,albeverio2006extreme}. 
Extreme-value statistics (EVS) has been a branch of statistics which deals with the extreme deviations of a random process from its mean behavior. For independent and identically distributed random variables, it is known that the extreme-value distribution falls into three famous universality classes,
namely, Gumbel, Fr\'echet, and Weibull depending on the
tails of the distribution of random variables \cite{gnedenko1943distribution}. The study of EVS has also become extremely important in the field of disordered
systems \cite{fyodorov2008freezing,fyodorov2010multifractality}, fluctuating interfaces \cite{raychaudhuri2001maximal,majumdar2004exact}, interacting
spin systems \cite{bar2016exact}, stochastic transport models \cite{majumdar2010real,guillet2020extreme}, random matrices \cite{dean2006large,majumdar2009large,majumdar2014top}, epidemic outbreak \cite{dumonteil2013spatial}, and computer search algorithms \cite{krapivsky2000traveling,majumdar2002extreme,majumdar2003traveling}.


In recent years, there is an increasing interest in studying the EVS for strongly correlated stochastic processes \cite{majumdar2010universal,schehr2014exact,lacroix2020universal,PhysRevLett.111.240601,PhysRevLett.117.080601,PhysRevLett.129.094101,PhysRevLett.130.207101}. We refer the readers to \cite{fortin2015applications,majumdar2020extreme} for two recent reviews on the subject. One of the central goals on this subject is to compute
the statistics of extremes, i.e., the maximum $M$ of a given
trajectory $x(t)$ during an observation time window $\left[0, t \right] $, and the time $t_m$ at which the maximum $M$ is reached. A paradigmatic example is a one-dimensional Brownian motion for a fixed duration $t$ starting from the origin, where the joint distribution of $M$ and $t_m$ is given by \cite{schehr2010extreme}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq0.1}
P_0(M, t_m|t)=\frac{M}{{2\pi D\sqrt {t_m^3\left( {t - {t_m}} \right)} }}{e^{ - {M^2}/4Dt_m}}
\end{eqnarray}
with the diffusion constant $D$. Marginalization of Eq.(\ref{eq0.1}) over $t_m$, one gets the one-sided Gaussian distribution of $M$,  
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq0.2}
P_0(M|t)= \frac{\Theta(M)}{\sqrt{\pi D t}} e^{-M^2/4Dt}, 
\end{eqnarray}
where $\Theta(z)$ is the Heaviside step function such that $\Theta(z)=1$ if $z>0$ and $\Theta(z)=0$ otherwise. In particular, from Eq.(\ref{eq0.2}) one can easily obtain that the expected maximum $M(t)$ of a free Brownian motion grows like $\langle M(t) \rangle =2\sqrt{D t/\pi}$. On the other hand, one can obtain the marginal distribution of $t_m$ by integrating $P_0(M,t_m|t)$ over $M$,   
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq0.3}
P_0(t_m|t)= \frac{1}{\pi \sqrt{t_m(t-t_m)}}, \quad 0\leq t_m \leq t,
\end{eqnarray}
which is often referred to as the ``arcsine law" due to P. L\'evy \cite{Levy1940ArcsineLaw,feller1971introduction,majumdar2007brownian}. The name stems from the fact that the cumulative distribution of $t_m$ reads $F(z) =  \int_0^z {P_0(t_m |t)dt_m}  = (2/\pi)\arcsin \sqrt {z/t}$. A counterintuitive aspect of the U-shaped distribution of Eq.(\ref{eq0.3}) is that its average value $\langle t_m \rangle=t/2$ corresponds to the minimum of the
distribution, i.e., the less probable outcome, whereas values
close to the extrema $t_m=0$ and $t_m=t$ are much more likely.


Extreme observables were also studied for variants of Brownian motion, such as in constrained Brownian motions \cite{majumdar2008time}, random acceleration process \cite{majumdar2010time,boutcheng2016occupation}, fractional Brownian motion \cite{sadhu2018generalized,sadhu2021functionals}, run-and-tumble motion \cite{hartmann2020convex,SinghArcsinelaws_RTP,singh2022mean}, resetting Brownian motion \cite{den2019properties,PhysRevE.103.052119,PhysRevE.103.022135,PhysRevLett.130.207101}, and for general
stochastic processes \cite{lamperti1958occupation,kasahara1977limit,dhar1999residence,majumdar2002exact,schehr2010extreme,PhysRevLett.107.170601,PhysRevE.83.061146,PhysRevE.105.024113,PhysRevE.102.032103}. Extension to study the distribution of the time difference
between the minimum and the maximum for stochastic processes has also been made in \cite{mori2019time,mori2020distribution} and to study the EVS before a first passage time through a specified threshold \cite{randon2007distribution,krapivsky2010maximum,singh2022extremal,PhysRevX.7.011019,guo2023extremal}. Quite remarkably, the statistics of $t_m$ has found applications in convex hull problems \cite{randon2009convex,PhysRevE.103.022135} and also in detecting whether a stationary process is equilibrium or not \cite{mori2021distribution,mori2022time}.  

So far, most of previous studies were paid their attentions to the EVS of the stochastic process without confinement. However, in many practical situations, the stochastic process takes place in a confined geometry. For example, the range of animal foraging can get constrained by natural or human-built obstacles, such as a river, mountains, urban areas, roads, and so on. A planar Brownian motion in the presence of an infinite reflective wall was studied \cite{chupeau2015convex,chupeau2015mean}. It was shown that the presence of the wall breaks the isotropy of the process and induces a non-trivial effect on the convex hull of the Brownian motion. Very recently, a Brownian particle in a $d$-dimensional ball with radius $R$ with reflecting boundaries was considered, and the statistics of the maximum displacement $M_x(t)$ of along the $x$-direction at time $t$ was studied. It was shown the distribution of the fluctuation $(M_x(t)-R)/R$ in the long-time limit exhibits a rich variety of behaviors depending on the dimension $d$. In a recent e-print \cite{kay2023extreme}, the authors studied that EVS of a one-dimensional Brownian motion in the presence of a permeable barrier when starting a position infinitely approaching the barrier. They derived the joint distribution of the maximum displacement $M(t)$ and the time $t_m$ at the maximum is reached, from which the marginal distributions of $M(t)$ and $t_m$ were also obtained.


In this work, we aim to study the EVS of the Brownian motion in one dimension subject to a reflective boundary at the origin when starting from a positive position $x_0$, such that the Brownian motion is confined in the positive half-space. From an intuitive perspective of view, when the total time duration $t$ is much less than the diffusion time $t_d=x^2_0/D$ from the starting position to the reflective boundary, the reflective boundary has not much impact on the Brownian motion and thus the EVS is similar to that of a free Brownian motion. A special focus should be paid to the case of $t$ equal to or larger than the order of the magnitude of $t_d$ where the reflective boundary comes into effect. We first derive the survival probability of the Brownian particle in the presence of a reflective boundary at the origin and an absorbing boundary at $x=M$, thus leading to the distribution $P(M|x_0,t)$ of the maximum displacement $M$ within a duration $t$. We also obtain the expectation $\langle M \rangle$ of $M$ as a function of $x_0$ and $t$, from which we find that in the long-time limit $\langle M \rangle \sim \sqrt{\pi D t}$, up to a correction proportional to $x_0^2/\sqrt{t}$. This is qualitatively the same as the case of the free Brownian motion ($\langle M \rangle \sim 2 \sqrt{ D t/\pi}$ for the latter), but with a different prefactor. Moreover, we use a path decomposition technique to obtain the joint distribution $P(M,t_m|x_0,t)$ of the maximum displacement $M$ and the time $t_m$ at which $M$ is reached. Marginalization of $P(M,t_m|x_0,t)$ over $M$ we obtain the distribution of $P(t_m|x_0,t)$. For $t>t_d$, the distribution of $t_m$ deviates from the so-called arcsine law, and is no longer symmetric with respect to $t/2$. Interestingly, we find that the ratio of the expectation of $t_m$ to $t$,  $\langle t_m \rangle/t$, increases monotonically with $t$, and its value approaches 1/2 in the limit $t \ll t_d$ and tends towards another constant $(1+2G)/4 \approx 0.708$ in the opposite limit $t \gg t_d$, where $G$ is the Catalan's constant.

\section{Model}
Let us consider a one-dimensional Brownian motion starting at $x_0$($>0$) with a reflective boundary at the origin, 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq1.0}
\dot{x}=\sqrt{2D} \xi(t)
\end{eqnarray}
where $D$ is the diffusion constant, and ${\xi }(t)$ is a Gaussian white noise with zero mean $\langle {\xi (t)} \rangle  = 0$ and delta correlator $\langle {\xi (t)}{\xi (t'} \rangle  = \delta ( {t - t'} )$. During a time interval $\left[0, t \right] $, the displacement $x(t)$ of the Brownian reaches its maximum $M$ at time $t_m$, see Fig.\ref{fig1} for an illustration. We are interested in the joint distribution $P(M, t_m|x_0,t)$ of $M$ and $t_m$, and their marginal distributions of $M$ and $t_m$, $P(M|x_0,t)$ and $P(t_m|x_0,t)$.  


\section{Propagator with a reflective wall at $x=0$ and an absorbing wall at $x=M$}
We begin with the computation of the probability density function $G(x,t|x_0)$ of position of the Brownian particle or the propagator in the presence of a reflective wall at $x=0$, when starting from an initial position $x_0 \in \left[0, M\right) $. On the other hand, the maximum displacement $M$ of the particle within a time duration $\left[0, t \right] $ yields an absorbing boundary at $x=M$.

\subsection{Propagator in the time domain}
The Fokker-Planck equation for governing the time evolution of  $G(x,t|x_0)$ reads
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq2.0}
\frac{{\partial G\left( {x,t|{x_0}} \right)}}{{\partial t}} = D\frac{{{\partial ^2}G\left( {x,t|{x_0}} \right)}}{{\partial {x^2}}}
\end{eqnarray}
Perfect reflection is imposed by requiring that the probability current vanishes at the origin, such that 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq2.0.1}
\frac{\partial G(x,t|x_0)}{\partial x}|_{x=0}=0.
\end{eqnarray}	
An absorbing boundary at $x=M$ requires
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq2.0.2}
G(M,t|x_0)=0.
\end{eqnarray}	
Using separation of variables, Eq.(\ref{eq2.0}) can be solved combined with the boundary conditions Eq.(\ref{eq2.0.1}), Eq.(\ref{eq2.0.2}), and initial condition $G(M,0|x_0)=\delta(x-x_0)$, which gives the series representation of the propagator, 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq4.1}
G\left( {x,t|{x_0}} \right) = \frac{2}{M}\sum\limits_{n = 0}^\infty  {\cos \left[ {\frac{{\left( {n + 1/2} \right)\pi {x_0}}}{M}} \right]} \cos \left[ {\frac{{\left( {n + 1/2} \right)\pi x}}{M}} \right] e^{{ - \frac{{{{\left( {n + 1/2} \right)}^2}{\pi ^2}Dt}}{{{M^2}}}} }
\end{eqnarray}

\subsection{Propagator in the Laplace domain} \label{sec3b}
In this subsection, we solve the propagator in the Laplace domain. By the Laplace transformations for Eq.(\ref{eq2.0}), Eq.(\ref{eq2.0.1}) and Eq.(\ref{eq2.0.2}), we obtain 
\begin{eqnarray}
s\tilde G( {x,s|{x_0}} ) - \delta ( {x - {x_0}} ) = D\frac{{{d^2}\tilde G( {x,s|{x_0}} )}}{{d{x^2}}}, \label{eq2.2.1} \\
\tilde G ( {M,s|{x_0}} ) = 0, \quad {\tilde G'} ( {0,s|{x_0}} ) = 0. \label{eq2.2.2}
\end{eqnarray}
Eq.(\ref{eq2.2.1}) can be solved separately in the region $0<x<x_0$ and in the region $x_0<x<M$. In each region the solutions are
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq2.3}
\tilde G ( {x,s|{x_0}} )= \left\{ \begin{array}{llc}
A_1 e^{\alpha x} + B_1 e^{-\alpha x} ,  & 0<x<x_0,  \\
A_2 e^{\alpha x} + B_2 e^{-\alpha x},   & x_0<x<M,  \\ 
\end{array}  \right. 
\end{eqnarray}
where $\alpha=\sqrt{s/D}$.


The boundary conditions in Eq.(\ref{eq2.2.2}) leads to 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq2.4}
\left\{ \begin{gathered}
{A_1}\alpha  - {B_1}\alpha  = 0, \hfill \\
{A_2}{e^{\alpha M}} + {B_2}{e^{ - \alpha M}} = 0. \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}  \right.
\end{eqnarray}
In addition, we require that $\tilde G ( {x,s|{x_0}} )$ is continuous at $x=x_0$, i.e., 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq2.5}
{A_1}{e^{\alpha {x_0}}} + {B_1}{e^{ - \alpha {x_0}}} = {A_2}{e^{\alpha {x_0}}} + {B_2}{e^{ - \alpha {x_0}}}.
\end{eqnarray}
However, due to the presence of the delta function in Eq.(\ref{eq2.2.1}) the derivative of $\tilde G ( {x,s|{x_0}} )$ is not continuous at  $x=x_0$. To find the matching condition for the derivative we integrate Eq.(\ref{eq2.2.1}) from $x_0-\epsilon$ to $x_0 + \epsilon$ (with $\epsilon \to 0^{+}$), which yields
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq2.6}
{\left. {\frac{{d\tilde G\left( {x,s|{x_0}} \right)}}{{dx}}} \right|_{x = x_0^ + }} - {\left. {\frac{{d\tilde G\left( {x,s|{x_0}} \right)}}{{dx}}} \right|_{x = x_0^ - }} =  - \frac{1}{D}.
\end{eqnarray}
According to Eq.(\ref{eq2.3}), the matching condition in Eq.(\ref{eq2.6}) becomes
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq2.7}
\left( {{A_2}\alpha {e^{\alpha {x_0}}} - {B_2}\alpha {e^{ - \alpha {x_0}}}} \right) - \left( {{A_1}\alpha {e^{\alpha {x_0}}} - {B_1}\alpha {e^{ - \alpha {x_0}}}} \right) =  - 1/D.
\end{eqnarray}
By solving Eq.(\ref{eq2.4}), Eq.(\ref{eq2.5}) and Eq.(\ref{eq2.7}), the coefficients $A_1$, $B_1$, $A_2$, and $B_2$ are given by
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq2.7.1}
\left\{ \begin{gathered}
{A_1} = {B_1} = \frac{{\sinh \left[ {\alpha \left( {M - {x_0}} \right)} \right]}}{{2\alpha D\cosh \left( {\alpha M} \right)}} \hfill \\
{A_2} = \frac{{\cosh \left( {\alpha {x_0}} \right)\left[ {\tanh \left( {\alpha M} \right) - 1} \right]}}{{2\alpha D}} \hfill \\
{B_2} = \frac{{\cosh \left( {\alpha {x_0}} \right)\left[ {\tanh \left( {\alpha M} \right) + 1} \right]}}{{2\alpha D}} \hfill \\ 
\end{gathered}  \right.
\end{eqnarray}
Substituting Eq.(\ref{eq2.7.1}) into Eq.(\ref{eq2.3}), we obtain the propagator in the Laplace domain, 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq2.8}
\tilde G\left( {x,s|{x_0}} \right) = \frac{{\cosh \left( {\alpha {x_ < }} \right)\sinh \left[ {\alpha \left( {M - {x_ > }} \right)} \right]}}{{\alpha D\cosh \left( {\alpha M} \right)}}
\end{eqnarray}
with $x_<=\min(x,x_0)$ and $x_>=\max(x,x_0)$.

\section{Survival probability with a reflective wall at $x=0$ and an absorbing wall at $x=M$}
\subsection{Survival probability in the time domain}
Let us denote by $Q(x_0,t|M)={\rm{Prob}}(x(\tau) \leq M | 0\leq \tau \leq t )$ the survival probability, i.e., the probability that the particle has not yet hit the absorbing boundary at $x=M$ up to time $t$ starting from $x_0$, which is given by \cite{redner2001guide}
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq4.2}
Q\left( {{x_0},t|M} \right) = \int_0^M dx {G\left( {x,t|{x_0}} \right)}  = \frac{2}{\pi }\sum\limits_{n = 0}^\infty  {\frac{{{{\left( { - 1} \right)}^n}}}{{n + 1/2}}\cos \left[ {\frac{{\left( {n + 1/2} \right)\pi {x_0}}}{M}} \right]} e^{ - \frac{{{{\left( {n + 1/2} \right)}^2}{\pi ^2}Dt}}{{{M^2}}}} 
\end{eqnarray}
\subsection{Survival probability in the Laplace domain}
We will see that in order to obtain the expectation of the maximum displacement $M$ it is convenient to solve survival probability in the Laplace domain. It is known that the survival probability satisfies the backward equation \cite{redner2001guide}, 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq1.1}
\frac{{\partial {Q}\left( {{x_0},t|M} \right)}}{{\partial t}} = D\frac{{{\partial ^2}{Q}\left( {{x_0},t|M} \right)}}{{\partial x_0^2}} ,
\end{eqnarray}
subject to the boundary conditions $Q(M,t|M)=0$ and $\partial Q(x_0,t|M)/ \partial x_0|_{x_0=0}=0$ and initial condition $Q(x_0,0|M)=1$ for $x_0 \in \left[ 0, M\right) $. Performing the Lapalce transform, $\tilde{Q}(x_0,s|M)=\int_{0}^{\infty} dt e^{-st} Q(x_0,t|M)$, for Eq.(\ref{eq1.1}) to obtain
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq1.2}
D\frac{{{d^2}{{\tilde Q}}\left( {{x_0},s|M} \right)}}{{dx_0^2}} -s {{\tilde Q}}\left( {{x_0},s|M} \right)  =  - 1.
\end{eqnarray}
Eq.(\ref{eq1.2}) can be solved subject to the boundary conditions $\tilde Q(M,s|M)=0$ and $\partial \tilde Q(x_0,s|M)/ \partial x_0|_{x_0=0}=0$, which yields
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq1.3}
\tilde Q(x_0,s|M)=\frac{1}{s}-\frac{ \cosh \left(\alpha  x_0 \right) }{s \cosh \left( \alpha M \right)}
\end{eqnarray}
with $\alpha=\sqrt{{s}/{D}}$ again.  


\section{Marginal distribution $P(M|x_0,t)$}
Differentiating Eq.(\ref{eq4.2}) with respect to $M$ gives the probability density function of $M$,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq4.3}
P\left( {M|{x_0},t} \right) = \frac{2}{{{M^2}}}\sum\limits_{n = 0}^\infty  {{{\left( { - 1} \right)}^n} e^{ - \frac{{{{\left( {n + 1/2} \right)}^2}{\pi ^2}Dt}}{{{M^2}}}} \left\{ {{x_0}\sin \left[ {\frac{{\left( {n + 1/2} \right)\pi {x_0}}}{M}} \right] + \frac{{2\left( {n + 1/2} \right)\pi Dt}}{M}\cos \left[ {\frac{{\left( {n + 1/2} \right)\pi {x_0}}}{M}} \right]} \right\}} .
\end{eqnarray}

In Fig.\ref{fig2}, we plot the marginal distribution $P(M|x_0,t)$ for different $t$, but with fixed $x_0=1$ and $D=1/2$. For comparison, we have performed simulations that supports our theory. In all simulations, we have used the time step $dt=10^{-5}$ and the results are averaged over $10^5$ different realizations. For $t$ much less than the diffusion time $t_d=x_0^2/D$ from the starting position $x_0$ to the reflective wall at the origin, the diffusing particle is almost unaffected by reflective boundary such that the distribution $P(M|x_0,t)$ is similar that of freely diffusive particle shown in Eq.(\ref{eq0.2}), from which we can observe that $P(M|x_0,t)$ decreases monotonically with $M$. As $t$ increases, the reflective boundary comes into effect, and $P(M|x_0,t)$ is no longer a monotonic function of $M$. Interestingly, $P(M|x_0,t)$ can show a unique maximum at an intermediate level of $M$. In the limit $t \gg t_d$, the summation in the right-hand side of Eq.(\ref{eq4.3}) is dominated by only one term for $n=0$. In this case, $P(M|x_0,t)$ decays with $M$ as $M^{-3}$ in the large-$M$ limit.     





Taking the derivative of Eq.(\ref{eq1.3}) with respect to $M$, we obtain the marginal distribution $P(M|x_0,t)$ in the Laplace domain,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq1.4}
\tilde P(M|x_0,s)=\frac{\partial \tilde Q(x_0,s|M)}{\partial M}  =\frac{\alpha \sinh (\alpha M) \cosh (\alpha x_0)}{s \cosh^2 (\alpha M)}.
\end{eqnarray}
It turns out that inverting Eq.(\ref{eq1.4}) is not a trivial task. However, we can conveniently compute the expectation of the maximum displacement $M$ from $\tilde P(M|x_0,s)$, defined as
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq1.5}
\langle M(x_0,t) \rangle =\int_{x_0}^{\infty} dM M P(M|x_0,t) .
\end{eqnarray}
Performing the Laplace transform for Eq.(\ref{eq1.5}) and utilizing Eq.(\ref{eq1.4}), we have
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq1.6}
 \int_{0}^{\infty}   dt e^{-st} \langle M(x_0,t) \rangle = \int_{x_0}^{\infty} dM  M \tilde{P}(M|x_0,s)  = \frac{x_0}{s}+ \frac{2 {\rm {\rm{arctan}}}(e^{-\alpha x_0}) \cosh(\alpha x_0)}{ \alpha s }.
\end{eqnarray}
Prior to the inversion of Eq.(\ref{eq1.6}), we first consider two limiting cases. In the short-time limit ($s \to \infty$) and in the long-time limit ($s \to 0$), Eq.(\ref{eq1.6}) becomes
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq1.6.1}
\int_{0}^{\infty} dt e^{-st} \langle M(x_0,t) \rangle = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc}
\frac{{{x_0}}}{s} + \frac{{\sqrt D }}{{{s^{3/2}}}},   & s \to \infty,  \\
\frac{{\pi \sqrt D }}{{2{s^{3/2}}}} + \frac{{\pi x_0^2}}{{4\sqrt {Ds} }}, &   s \to 0.  \\ 
\end{array}  \right. 
\end{eqnarray}
Performing the inverse Laplace transform for Eq.(\ref{eq1.6.1}), we obtain
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq1.6.2}
\langle  M(x_0,t) \rangle= \left\{ \begin{array}{cc}
x_0+\frac{{2\sqrt {Dt} }}{{\sqrt \pi  }} ,   & t \ll t_d,  \\
\sqrt {\pi Dt} + \frac{{\sqrt \pi  x_0^2}}{{4\sqrt {Dt} }}, &   t \gg t_d.  \\ 
\end{array}  \right. 
\end{eqnarray}
In the short-time limit, $t \ll t_d=\frac{x_0^2}{D}$, the result coincides with the counterpart of the free Brownian motion. In the long-time limit, $t \gg t_d$, the expected maximum is weakly related to the initial position $x_0$, and grows with $t^{1/2}$ as $t$ increases. Interestingly, the expected maximum under the case is  $\pi/2$ times that of the free Brownian motion starting from the origin.

To invert Eq.(\ref{eq1.6}) for the general case, we intend to rewrite Eq.(\ref{eq1.6}) as series expansions. To the end, let us denote by $y=e^{\alpha x_0}$, and use the equations $\arctan ( {1/y} ) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{\frac{{{{\left( { - 1} \right)}^n}}}{{2n + 1}}{y^{ - \left( {2n + 1} \right)}}} $ ($ y\geq 1$) and $\cosh(\ln y)=\frac{1+y^2}{2y}$ to obtain 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq1.11}
 \int_0^\infty  dt {\langle {M( x_0, t )} \rangle {e^{ - st}}} &=& \frac{{{x_0}}}{s}   +  \frac{1}{{\alpha s}}\sum\limits_{n = 0}^\infty  {\frac{{{{\left( { - 1} \right)}^n}}}{{2n + 1}}} \left[ {{e^{ - 2n\alpha {x_0}}} + {e^{ - (2n + 2)\alpha {x_0}}}} \right] \nonumber \\ &=&\frac{{{x_0}}}{s} + \frac{1}{{\alpha s}} - \frac{2}{{\alpha s}}\sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {\frac{{{{\left( { - 1} \right)}^{n }}}}{{4{n^2} - 1}}} {e^{ - 2n\alpha {x_0}}}.
\end{eqnarray}
Performing the Laplace transform inversion for Eq.(\ref{eq1.11}), we obtain
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq1.12}
\langle {M( {{x_0},t} )} \rangle  ={x_0} + 2\sqrt {\frac{{Dt}}{\pi }}  - 4\sum\limits_{n = 1}^\infty  {\frac{{{{\left( { - 1} \right)}^n}}}{{4{n^2} - 1}}} \left[ {\sqrt {\frac{{Dt}}{\pi }} {e^{ - \frac{{{n^2}x_0^2}}{{Dt}}}} - n{x_0}{\rm{erfc}}\left( {\frac{{n{x_0}}}{{\sqrt {Dt} }}} \right)} \right],
\end{eqnarray}
where ${\rm{erfc}}(x)$ is the complementary error function. We note that the result in Eq.(\ref{eq1.12}) was obtained in a previous work as well (see Eq.(5) in \cite{chupeau2015convex}). However, in the present work we additionally obtain the distribution of $M$ and will further derive the statistics of extremal time in the subsequent sections. In Fig.\ref{fig3}, we show a log–log plot of $\langle  M(x_0,t)  \rangle$ as a function of $t$, where we have fixed $x_0=1$ and $D=1/2$. The theoretical prediction is in well agreement with simulations.  For comparison, we plot in Fig.\ref{fig3} the expectation $\langle  x(t)  \rangle$ of the displacement $x(t)$ as a function of $t$ as well. The details of derivation of $\langle  x(t)  \rangle$ can be found in appendix \ref{appen1}. In the short-time limit, $\langle  x(t)  \rangle =x_0$ keeps unchanged as a free Brownian motion, and in the long-time limit $\langle  x(t)  \rangle \sim \sqrt{t}$, but the prefactor is smaller than that of the expected maximum displacement. 


\section{Joint distribution $P(M,t_m|x_0,t)$}
Let us define $P(M,t_m|x_0,t)$ as the joint probability density function that the displacement $x(\tau)$ reaches its maximum $M$ at time $t_m$ with a duration $t$, providing that the Brownian starts from the position $x_0$ ($>0$). To compute the joint distribution $P(M,t_m|x_0,t)$, we can decompose the trajectory into two parts: a left-hand segment for which $0<\tau<t_m$, and a right-hand segment for which $t_m<\tau<t$, as shown in Fig.\ref{fig1}. The statistical weight of the first segment equals to the propagator $G(M,t_m|x_0)$. However, it turns out that $G(M,t_m|x_0)=0$ which implies that the contribution from this part is zero. To circumvent this problem, we compute $G(M-\epsilon,t_m|x_0)$ and later take the limit $\epsilon \to 0$ \cite{majumdar2004exact}. The statistical weight of the second segment is given by the survival probability $Q(M-\epsilon,t-t_m|M)$. Due to the Markov property, the joint probability density $P(M,t_m|x_0,t)$ can be written as the product of the statistical weights of two segments \cite{randon2007distribution}, 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq3.1}
P\left( {M,{t_m}|{x_0},t} \right) = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{\epsilon \to 0}  \mathcal{N} G\left( {M - \epsilon,{t_m}|{x_0}} \right)Q\left( {M - \epsilon,t - {t_m}|M} \right).
\end{eqnarray}
Here, the normalization factor $\mathcal{N}$ may depend on $D$ and $\epsilon$. In principle, $\mathcal{N}$ depends also on $x_0$ and $t$. However, here we assume and verify a posteriori that it is indeed independent of $x_0$ and $t$.

Let us integrate $P(M,t_m|x_0,t)$ over $t_m$ from 0 to $t$ and over $M$ from $x_0$ to $\infty$, and then perform the Laplace transform with respect to $t$, such that the convolution structure of Eq.(\ref{eq3.1}) can be exploited, 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq3.2}
\frac{1}{s}=\int_{0}^{\infty} dt {{e^{ - st}} \int_{{x_0}}^\infty dM  {\int_0^t dt_m P( {M,{t_m}|{x_0},t} )} }  = \mathop {\lim }\limits_{\epsilon \to 0} \mathcal{N} \int_{x_0}^{\infty}dM\tilde G( {M - \epsilon,s|{x_0}} )\tilde Q( {M - \epsilon,s|M} ) .
\end{eqnarray}
Here, $\tilde G( {M - \epsilon,s|{x_0}} )$ and $\tilde Q( {M - \epsilon,s|M} )$ can be obtained from Eq.(\ref{eq2.8}) and Eq.(\ref{eq1.3}). Up to the leading order of $\epsilon$, they are    
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq3.3}
\tilde G( {M - \epsilon,{s}|{x_0}} ) = \frac{{\cosh \left( {\alpha {x_0}} \right)}}{{D\cosh \left( {\alpha M} \right)}}\epsilon,
\end{eqnarray}
and
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq3.4}
\tilde Q\left( {M - \epsilon,s|M} \right) = \frac{{\alpha \tanh \left( {\alpha M} \right)}}{s}\epsilon,
\end{eqnarray}
where $\alpha=\sqrt{s/D}$ again. By inserting Eq.(\ref{eq3.3}) and Eq.(\ref{eq3.4}) into Eq.(\ref{eq3.2}) and completing the integration over $M$ on the right-hand side of Eq.(\ref{eq3.2}), we obtain the  normalization factor $\mathcal{N}$,  
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq3.5}
\mathcal{N}=\frac{D}{\epsilon^2}.
\end{eqnarray}

Moreover, we perform double Laplace transformations for $P(M,t_m|x_0,t)$ with respect to $t_m$ ($\to s$) and $t$ ($\to p$), and use Eq.(\ref{eq3.3}), Eq.(\ref{eq3.4}) and Eq.(\ref{eq3.5}), to obtain
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq5.1}
\int_0^\infty  {dt} {e^{ - pt}}\int_0^t {d{t_m}{e^{ - s{t_m}}}P\left( {M,{t_m}|{x_0},t} \right)}  = \frac{{\cosh \left( {\sqrt {\left( {p + s} \right)/D} {x_0}} \right)}}{{\cosh \left( {\sqrt {\left( {p + s} \right)/D} M} \right)}}\frac{{\tanh \left( {\sqrt {p/D} M} \right)}}{{\sqrt {pD} }},
\end{eqnarray}
where we have exchanged the orders of integrations over $t$ and $t_m$. By using the inverse Laplace transform relations \cite{oberhettinger2012tables},
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq5.2}
\mathcal{L}_{s \to t}^{ - 1}\left[ {\cosh \left( {\nu {s^{ - 1/2}}} \right) {\rm{sech}} \left( {a{s^{ - 1/2}}} \right)} \right] &=& \frac{1}{a}\frac{\partial }{{\partial \nu }}{\theta _1}\left( {\frac{1}{2}\nu {a^{ - 1}}|t{a^{ - 2}}} \right),\\
\mathcal{L}_{s \to t}^{ - 1}\left[ {{s^{ - 1/2}}\tanh \left( {a{s^{ - 1/2}}} \right)} \right]& =& \frac{1}{a}{\theta _2}\left( {0|t{a^{ - 2}}} \right),
\end{eqnarray}
where
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq5.3}
{\theta _1}\left( {z|t} \right) & =& 2\sum\limits_{n = 0}^\infty  {{{\left( { - 1} \right)}^n} e^{ - {{\left( {n + 1/2} \right)}^2}{\pi ^2}t}  } \sin \left[ {\left( {2n + 1} \right)\pi z} \right] , \\
{\theta _2}\left( {z|t} \right)& =& 2\sum\limits_{n = 0}^\infty  { e^{ - {{\left( {n + 1/2} \right)}^2}{\pi ^2}t} } \cos \left[ {\left( {2n + 1} \right)\pi z} \right] ,
\end{eqnarray}
are the Elliptic theta functions, we obtain $P(M,t_m|x_0,t)$ from Eq.(\ref{eq5.1}), 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq5.4}
P\left( {M,{t_m}|{x_0},t} \right)& =& \frac{1}{M^2}\frac{\partial }{{\partial \nu }}{\theta _1}\left( {\frac{1}{2}\nu {a^{ - 1}}|{t_m}{a^{ - 2}}} \right){\theta_2}\left( {0|(t-t_m){a^{-2}}} \right) \nonumber \\ &=&
\frac{{4\pi D}}{{{M^3}}}\sum\limits_{{n_1} = 0}^\infty  {\sum\limits_{{n_2} = 0}^\infty  {{{\left( { - 1} \right)}^{{n_1}}}\left( {{n_1} + \frac{1}{2}} \right)} {e^{ - \frac{{{\pi ^2}D}}{{{M^2}}}\left[ {{{\left( {{n_1} + \frac{1}{2}} \right)}^2}{t_m} + {{\left( {{n_2} + \frac{1}{2}} \right)}^2}\left( {t - {t_m}} \right)} \right]}}} \cos \left[ {\frac{{\left( {{n_1} + 1/2} \right)\pi {x_0}}}{M}} \right]
\end{eqnarray}
where $a=M/\sqrt{D}$ and $\nu=x_0/\sqrt{D}$. In fact, the joint distribution $P(M,t_m|x_0,t)$ in Eq.(\ref{eq5.4}) can be also obtained directedly from the results in the time domain. This can be done more easily by series expansions of $G(M-\epsilon,t_m|x_0)$ and $Q(M-\epsilon,t-t_m|M)$ to the first order in terms of  Eq.(\ref{eq4.1}) and Eq.(\ref{eq4.2}), and then inserting them into Eq.(\ref{eq3.1}).

\section{Marginal distribution $P(t_m|x_0,t)$}
Integrating $P(M,t_m|x_0,t)$ in Eq.(\ref{eq5.4}) over $M$ from $x_0$ to $\infty$, we get to the marginal distribution $P(t_m|x_0,t)$ of $t_m$ at which the maximum displacement $M$ is achieved, 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq6.1}
P\left( {{t_m}|{x_0},t} \right)& = &\int_{{x_0}}^\infty  {dMP\left( {M,{t_m}|{x_0},t} \right)} \nonumber \\& =& 4\pi D\sum\limits_{{n_1} = 0}^\infty  {\sum\limits_{{n_2} = 0}^\infty  {{{\left( { - 1} \right)}^{{n_1}}}\left( {{n_1} + \frac{1}{2}} \right)} } F\left( { {\pi ^2}D\left[ {{{\left( {{n_1} + \frac{1}{2}} \right)}^2}{t_m} + {{\left( {{n_2} + \frac{1}{2}} \right)}^2}\left( {t - {t_m}} \right)} \right], \left( {{n_1} + \frac{1}{2}} \right)\pi {x_0}} \right),
\end{eqnarray}
where 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq6.2}
F\left( {a,b} \right) &=& \int_{{x_0}}^\infty  dM\frac{1}{{{M^3}}}{e^{ - \frac{a}{{{M^2}}}}}\cos \left( {\frac{b}{M}} \right) \nonumber \\ &=& \frac{1}{{2a}} - \frac{1}{{2a}}{e^{ - \frac{a}{{x_0^2}}}}\cos \left( {\frac{b}{{{x_0}}}} \right) - \frac{{\sqrt \pi  b}}{{4{a^{3/2}}}}{e^{ - \frac{{{b^2}}}{{4a}}}}{\rm{erfi}}\left( {\frac{b}{{2\sqrt a }}} \right) + \frac{{\sqrt \pi  b}}{{8{a^{3/2}}}}{e^{ - \frac{{{b^2}}}{{4a}}}}\left[ {{\rm{erfi}}\left( {\frac{{2a {\rm{i}}  + b{x_0}}}{{2\sqrt a {x_0}}}} \right) - {\rm{erfi}}\left( {\frac{{2a {\rm{i}} - b{x_0}}}{{2\sqrt a {x_0}}}} \right)} \right].
\end{eqnarray}
Here ${\rm{erfi}}(z)=-{\rm{i}}{\rm{erf}}({\rm{i}}z)$ is the imaginary error function, and ${\rm{i}}$ is the unit imaginary number.

In Fig.\ref{fig5}, we show the distribution $P(t_m|x_0,t)$ of $t_m$ for several different values of $t$. The results from theory and simulations are in agreement well.  For $t \ll t_d$, the particle has a very low probability of diffusing the reflective boundary, such that the particle behaves a free diffusion without any boundaries and $P(t_m|x_0,t)$ is U-shaped as indicated in Eq.(\ref{eq0.3}). For $t \gg t_d$, the reflective boundary comes into effect and $P(t_m|x_0,t)$ deviates from the U-shaped distribution, and becomes asymmetric with respect to $t_m=t/2$. There is a higher probability of $t_m$ that occurs near $t$.  

  

Moreover, we seek to find the marginal distribution $P(t_m|x_0,t)$ in the Laplace domain. To the end, we perform double Laplace transforms for $P(t_m|x_0,t)$, and use Eq.(\ref{eq3.3}), Eq.(\ref{eq3.4}) and Eq.(\ref{eq3.5}) to obtain
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq6.3}
\int_0^\infty  {dt} {e^{ - pt}}\int_0^t {d{t_m}{e^{ - s{t_m}}}P\left( {{t_m}|{x_0},t} \right)}  = \int_{{x_0}}^\infty  {dM\frac{{\cosh \left( {\sqrt {\left( {p + s} \right)/D} {x_0}} \right)}}{{\cosh \left( {\sqrt {\left( {p + s} \right)/D} M} \right)}}\frac{{\tanh \left( {\sqrt {p/D} M} \right)}}{{\sqrt {pD} }}} .
\end{eqnarray}
In the short-time limit ($p \to \infty$), using $\cosh(x) \sim e^{x}/2$ and $\tanh(x) \sim 1$ ($x \to \infty$), one easily recovers to the result in Eq.(\ref{eq0.3}) from Eq.(\ref{eq6.3}). Furthermore, one observes that Eq.(\ref{eq6.3}) is not invariant under the exchange of $p+s \leftrightarrow p$. This implies that $P(t_m|x_0,t)$ is no longer symmetric with respect to $t/2$ in the presence of the reflective boundary.  

Taking the derivative of Eq.(\ref{eq6.3}) with respect to $s$ and letting $s \to 0$, we obtain the Laplace transformation of the expectation of $t_m$,
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq3.8}
\int_0^\infty  {dt{e^{ - pt}}} \langle {{t_m}(x_0,t)} \rangle &=&  - \int_{{x_0}}^\infty  {dM\frac{\partial }{{\partial s}}{{\left[ {\frac{{\cosh \left( {\sqrt {\left( {p + s} \right)/D} {x_0}} \right)}}{{\cosh \left( {\sqrt {\left( {p + s} \right)/D} M} \right)}}} \right]}_{s \to 0}}\frac{{\tanh \left( {\sqrt {p/D} M} \right)}}{{\sqrt {pD} }}} \nonumber \\ & =& \frac{1}{{2pD}}\int_{{x_0}}^\infty  {dM\frac{{\sinh \left( {\sqrt {p/D} M} \right)}}{{{{\cosh }^2}\left( {\sqrt {p/D} M} \right)}}\left[ {M\cosh \left( {\sqrt {p/D} {x_0}} \right)\tanh \left( {\sqrt {p/D} M} \right) - {x_0}\sinh \left( {\sqrt {p/D} {x_0}} \right)} \right]}  \nonumber \\  &=& \frac{1}{{4{p^2}}} - \frac{{{x_0}\cosh \left( \sqrt{p/D}x_0  \right) }}{{4\sqrt {{p^3}D} }} {\rm{arg}}\left( {\frac{{{e^{\sqrt{p/D}x_0}} - {\rm{i}} }}{{{e^{\sqrt{p/D}x_0}} + {\rm{i}} }}} \right) +  \frac{{\cosh \left( \sqrt{p/D}x_0  \right) {e^{ - \sqrt{p/D}x_0}}}}{{8{p^2}}} \nonumber \\ && \times \Phi \left( { - {e^{ - 2\sqrt{p/D}x_0}},2,\frac{1}{2}} \right)  - \frac{{{x_0}}}{{4\sqrt {{p^3}D} }}\tanh \left( \sqrt{p/D}x_0  \right) ,
\end{eqnarray}
where ${\rm{arg}}(z)$ denotes the argument of a complex number $z$, ${\rm{i}}$ is the unit imaginary number, and
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq3.9.1}
\Phi \left( {z,2,\frac{1}{2}} \right) = \sum\limits_{k = 0}^\infty  {\frac{{{z^k}}}{{{{\left( {k + 1/2} \right)}^2}}}} ,
\end{eqnarray}
is the Lerch transcendent function. It turns out that inverting Eq.(\ref{eq3.8}) with respect to $p$ is a highly nontrivial task. However, in the short-time limit ($p \to \infty$) and in the long-time limit ($p \to 0$), Eq.(\ref{eq3.8}) can be simplified to 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq3.10}
\int_0^\infty  {dt{e^{ - pt}}} \langle {{t_m}} \rangle  = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc}
\frac{1}{2p^2} ,   & p \to \infty,  \\
\frac{{1 + 2G}}{{4{p^2}}}, &   p \to 0,  \\ 
\end{array}  \right. 
\end{eqnarray}
where $G=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(-1)^k/(2k+1)^2 \approx 0.916$ is the Catalan's constant. Inverting Eq.(\ref{eq3.10}) with respect to $p$, we obtain 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eq3.11}
\frac{{\langle {{t_m}} \rangle }}{t}  = \left\{ \begin{array}{cc}
\frac{1}{2} ,   & t \ll t_d,  \\
 \frac{{1 + 2G}}{4}, &   t \gg t_d.  \\ 
\end{array}  \right. 
\end{eqnarray}

In Fig.\ref{fig4}, we plot $\langle{t_m}\rangle/t$ as a function of $t$ for the fixed $x_0=1$ and $D=1/2$, from which we can see that the ratio $\langle{t_m}\rangle/t$ increases monotonically with $t$. $\langle{t_m}\rangle/t$ approaches $1/2$ in the short-time limit, and tends towards $\frac{{1 + 2G}}{4}\approx 0.708$ in the long-time limit, which are consistent with our theoretical predictions in Eq.(\ref{eq3.11}).
    

\section{Conclusions}
In conclusion, we have studied the extremal statistics of a one-dimensional Brownian motion within a time duration $t$ in the presence of a reflective wall at the origin when the motion starts from a positive position $x_0$. By computing the survival probability without hitting an absorbing boundary at $x=M$, we obtain the marginal distribution $P(M|x_0,t)$, and the average maximum displacement $\langle M(x_0,t) \rangle$. We then use a path decomposition technique to compute the joint distribution $P(M,t_m|x_0,t)$ of the maximum displacement $M$ and the time $t_m$ at which $M$ is reached, from which we also obtain the marginal distribution $P(t_m|x_0,t)$ of $t_m$ and the average value $\langle t_m(x_0,t) \rangle$ of $t_m$. In the short-time limit ($t \ll t_d$), the reflective wall does not produce much impact on the extremal statistics of $M$ and $t_m$, and thus our model is similar to the case of free Brownian motion without a reflective wall. As $t$ increases and becomes comparable with $t_d$, the reflective wall initiates a sigificant effect on the extremal statistics of $M$ and $t_m$. Unlike free Brownian motion where the distribution $P(M|x_0,t)$ decays monotonically with $M$, $P(M|x_0,t)$ can display a single maximum at an intermediate level of $M$. $\langle M(x_0,t) \rangle$ increases with $t$, and in the long-time limit $\langle M(x_0,t) \rangle =\sqrt{\pi D t}$, where the prefactor $\sqrt{\pi D }$ is $\pi/2$ times of free Brownian motion starting from the origin. In the presence of a reflective wall,  $P(t_m|x_0,t)$ deviates from the case of free Brownian motion. There is a higher probability of $t_m$ occurring near $t$, and thus becomes asymmetric with respect to $t_m=t/2$. The ratio $\langle t_m(x_0,t) \rangle/t$ increases monotonically from 1/2 as $t$ increases, and approaches another constant $(1+2G)/4 \approx0.708$ in the limit of $t \gg t_d$, where $G$ is the Catalan's constant. 

It would be worthy to explore two possible extensions of the present study in the future. These include the study of EVS of Brownian motions in high dimensions in which the boundaries are set to be reflective and otherwise opening. For example, a planar  Brownian motion confined in a wedge geometry with reflective boundaries. Another interesting extension is to investigate the EVS of active Brownian motions in the presence of reflective boundary, such as run-and-tumble motions in one dimension confined in a half-axis by a reflective wall. It would be interesting to explore the effect of nonequilibrium noise on the EVS of Brownian motions.

\section{The expectation $\langle x(t) \rangle$ of the displacement $x(t)$ with a reflective wall}\label{appen1}
We solve the diffusion equation Eq.(\ref{eq2.2.1}) in the Laplace domain, subject to a reflective boundary at $x=0$, ${\tilde G'} ( {0,s|{x_0}} ) = 0$. The boundary at $x=+\infty$ requires ${\tilde G} ( {+\infty,s|{x_0}} ) = 0$. On the other hand, the continuous condition in Eq.(\ref{eq2.6}) and the matching condition in Eq.(\ref{eq2.6}) are both satisfied. As done in Sec\ref{sec3b}, the solution is 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqa1.1}
\tilde G\left( {x,s|{x_0}} \right) = \frac{{{e^{ - \alpha \left( {x + {x_0}} \right)}} + {e^{\alpha \left( {{x_ < } - {x_ > }} \right)}}}}{{2\alpha D}}
\end{eqnarray}
where $\alpha=\sqrt{s/D}$, $x_<=\min(x,x_0)$ and $x_>=\max(x,x_0)$. Multiplying Eq.(\ref{eqa1.1}) by $x$ and then integrating over $x$ from 0 to $\infty$, we have 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqa1.2}
\langle {x( s )} \rangle  = \int_0^\infty  {dxx\tilde G\left( {x,s|{x_0}} \right)}=\frac{{{e^{ - \alpha {x_0}}} + \alpha {x_0}}}{{{\alpha ^3}D}}
\end{eqnarray}
By Laplace tranform inversion for Eq.(\ref{eqa1.2}), we obtain the expectation $\langle x(t) \rangle$ of the displacement $x(t)$, 
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqa1.3}
\langle {x( t )} \rangle  = 2{e^{ - \frac{{x_0^2}}{{4Dt}}}}\sqrt {\frac{{Dt}}{\pi }}  + {x_0}{\rm{erf}}\left( {\frac{{{x_0}}}{{2\sqrt {Dt} }}} \right)
\end{eqnarray}
where ${\rm{erf}}(x)$ is the error function. Considering the short-time limit and the long-time limit, we have
\begin{eqnarray}\label{eqa1.4}
\langle x(t) \rangle= \left\{ \begin{array}{cc}
x_0,   & t \ll t_d,  \\
2\sqrt {\frac{{Dt}}{\pi }}  + \frac{{x_0^2}}{{2\sqrt {\pi Dt} }}, &   t \gg t_d. \\ 
\end{array}  \right. 
\end{eqnarray}
