  "abstract": "This research focuses on the evolving dynamics of the power grid, where traditional synchronous generators are being replaced by non-synchronous power electronic converter (PEC)-interfaced renewable energy sources. The non-linear dynamics must be accurately modeled to ensure the stability of future converter-dominated power systems (CDPS). However, obtaining comprehensive dynamic models becomes more complex and computationally intensive as the system grows. This study proposes a scalable and automated data-driven partitioned modeling framework for CDPS dynamics. The method constructs reduced-ordered dynamic linear transfer function models using input-output measurements from a PEC switching model. Validation experiments were conducted on single-house and multi-house scenarios, demonstrating high accuracy (over 97%) and significant computational speed improvements (6.5 times faster) compared to comprehensive models. This framework and modeling approach offers valuable insights for efficient analysis of power system dynamics, aiding in planning, operation, and dispatch.",
