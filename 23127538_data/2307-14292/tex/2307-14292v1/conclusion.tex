\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have shown that, for every $\MSO_1$ property $\Pi$ on labeled graphs, there exists a PLS for $\Pi$ with $O(\log^2 n)$-bit certificates for all $n$-node graphs of bounded clique-width. This extends previous results for smaller classes of graphs, namely graphs of bounded tree-depth~\cite{FeuilloleyBP22}, and graphs of bounded tree-width~\cite{FraigniaudMRT22}. Our result also  enables to establish a separation, in term of certificate size, between certifying $C_4$-free graphs and certifying $P_4$-free graphs.  

A natural question is whether the certificate size resulting from  our generic PLS construction is optimal. Note that one log-factor is related to the storage of IDs, and of similar types of information related to other nodes in the graph. It seems hard to avoid such a log-factor. The other log-factor is however directly related to the depth of the NLC-decomposition, and our PLS actually uses certificates of size $O(d\cdot\log n)$ bits for graphs supporting an NLC-decomposition of depth~$d$. Nevertheless, the best generic upper bound for the depth~$d$ of an NLC-decomposition preserving bounded width is $O(\log n)$. This log-factor seems therefore hard to avoid too. Establishing the existence of a PLS for $\MSO_1$ properties in graphs of bounded clique-width using $o(\log^2n)$-bit certificates, or proving an $\Omega(\log^2n)$ lower bound on the certificate size for such PLSs  appears to be challenging. 

Another interesting research direction is whether our result can be extended to $\MSO_2$ properties. It is known that the meta-theorem from~\cite{CourcelleMR00} does not extend to $\MSO_2$. Nevertheless, this does not necessarily prevent the existence of compact PLSs for $\MSO_2$ properties on graphs of bounded clique-width. For instance,  Hamiltonicity is an $\MSO_2$ property that can be easily certified in \textit{all} graphs, using certificates on just $O(\log n)$ bits. Is there an $\MSO_2$ property requiring certificates of $\Omega(n^\epsilon)$ bits, for some $\epsilon>0$, on graphs of bounded clique-width? Finally, it might be interesting to study the existence of compact distributed interactive proofs~\cite{KolOS18} for certifying $\MSO_1$ or even $\MSO_2$ properties on graphs of bounded clique-width. Note that the generic compiler from~\cite{NaorPY20} efficiently applies to sparse graphs only whereas the family of graphs with bounded clique-width includes dense graphs.
