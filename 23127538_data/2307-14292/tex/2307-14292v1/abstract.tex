\begin{abstract}
A \emph{proof-labeling scheme} (PLS) for a  boolean predicate~$\Pi$ on labeled graphs is a mechanism used for certifying the legality with respect to~$\Pi$ of global network states   in a distributed manner. In a PLS, a \emph{certificate} is assigned to each processing node of the network, and the nodes are in charge of checking that the collection of certificates forms a global proof that the system is in a correct state, by exchanging the certificates once, between neighbors only. The main measure of complexity is the \emph{size} of the certificates. Many PLSs have been designed for certifying specific predicates, including cycle-freeness, minimum-weight spanning tree, planarity, etc. 

In 2021, a breakthrough has been obtained, as a ``meta-theorem'' stating that a large set of properties have compact PLSs in a large class of networks. Namely, for every  $\MSO_2$ property~$\Pi$ on labeled graphs, there exists a PLS for~$\Pi$ with $O(\log n)$-bit certificates for all graphs of bounded \emph{tree-depth}. This result has been extended to the larger class of  graphs with bounded \emph{tree-width}, using certificates on $O(\log^2 n)$ bits. 

We extend this result even further, to the larger class of graphs with bounded \emph{clique-width}, which, as opposed to the other two aforementioned classes, includes dense graphs. We show that, for every $\MSO_1$ property~$\Pi$  on labeled graphs, there exists a PLS for $\Pi$ with $O(\log^2 n)$-bit certificates for all graphs of bounded clique-width. As a consequence, certifying families of graphs such as distance-hereditary graphs and (induced) $P_4$-free graphs (a.k.a., cographs) can be done using a PLS with $O(\log^2 n)$-bit  certificates, merely because each of these two classes can be specified in $\MSO_1$. In fact, we show that certifying $P_4$-free graphs can be done with certificates on $O(\log n)$ bits only. This is in contrast to the class of $C_4$-free graphs (which \revision{does} not have bounded clique-width) which requires $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{n})$-bit certificates.
