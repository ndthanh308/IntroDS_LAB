abstract = {Some gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have a tera–electron volt (TeV) afterglow, but the early onset of this has not been observed. We report observations with the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) of the bright GRB 221009A, which serendipitously occurred within the instrument’s field of view. More than 64,000 photons \&gt;0.2 TeV were detected within the first 3000 seconds. The TeV flux began several minutes after the GRB trigger and then rose to a peak ~10 seconds later. This was followed by a decay phase, which became more rapid ~650 seconds after the peak. We interpret the emission using a model of a relativistic jet with half-opening angle of ~0.8°. This is consistent with the core of a structured jet and could explain the high isotropic energy of this GRB. Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are produced by the explosion of a high-mass star, which produces a jet of material moving close to the speed of light. The LHAASO Collaboration observed the extremely bright GRB 221009A in very-high-energy (tera–electron volt) gamma rays. The GRB serendipitously occurred within the large field of view of their detector, so these data cover the rapid rise, peak emission, and gradually dimming afterglow. Modeling of the observations showed that the jet had an opening angle of less than one degree, which must have been pointed almost exactly toward Earth, explaining the unusual brightness of this GRB. —Keith T. Smith Observations of the bright gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A at tera–electron volt energies show that it contained a very narrow jet.}}

Long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are produced by the explosion of a high-mass star, which produces a jet of material moving close to the speed of light. The LHAASO Collaboration observed the extremely bright GRB 221009A in very-high-energy (tera–electron volt) gamma rays. The GRB serendipitously occurred within the large field of view of their detector, so these data cover the rapid rise, peak emission, and gradually dimming afterglow. Modeling of the observations showed that the jet had an opening angle of less than one degree, which must have been pointed almost exactly toward Earth, explaining the unusual brightness of this GRB. —Keith T. Smith Observations of the bright gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A at tera–electron volt energies show that it contained a very narrow jet.}}
