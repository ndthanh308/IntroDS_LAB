  "abstract": "Arising from: Mankowitz, D.J., Michi, A., Zhernov, A. et al. Faster sorting algorithms discovered using deep reinforcement learning.Nature 618, 257-263 (2023). doi.org/10.1038/s41586-023-06004-9.\n  The article cited above presents new implementations of sorting algorithms found through deep reinforcement learning that work on a small number of numeric inputs. For 3 numbers, the published implementation contains 17 assembly instructions, and the authors state that no shorter program exists. This note presents two counterexamples for this claim and a straightforward C/C++ implementation that is faster than theirs.",
