  "abstract": "The energy of the transition from Galactic to extra-galactic origin of cosmic rays is one of the major unresolved issues of cosmic-ray physics. However, strong constraints can be obtained from studying the anisotropy in the arrival directions of cosmic rays. The sensitivity to cosmic-ray anisotropy is, in particular, a matter of statistics. Recently, the cosmic ray anisotropy measurements in the TeV to PeV energy range were updated from IceCube using 11 years of data. The IceCube-Gen2 surface array will cover an area about 8 times larger than the existing IceTop surface array with a corresponding increase in statistics and capability to investigate cosmic-ray anisotropy with higher sensitivity. In this contribution, we present details on the performed simulation studies and sensitivity to the cosmic-ray anisotropy signal for the IceCube-Gen2 surface array.",
