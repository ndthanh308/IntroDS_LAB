    We consider coupled fast-slow stochastic processes, where the averaged slow motion is given by a two-dimensional Hamiltonian system with multiple critical points. On a proper time scale, the evolution of the first integral converges to a diffusion process on the corresponding Reeb graph, with certain gluing conditions specified at the interior vertices. This limiting process is similar to that in the case of additive white noise perturbations of Hamiltonian systems considered by M. Freidlin and A. Wentzell, but now the analysis of the behavior near the critical points requires new interesting techniques.\\
