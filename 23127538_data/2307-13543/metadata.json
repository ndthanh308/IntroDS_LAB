  "abstract": "We propose a novel framework for the Lyapunov analysis of an important class of hybrid systems, inspired by the theory of symbolic dynamics and earlier results on the restricted class of switched systems. This new framework allows us to leverage language theory tools in order to provide a universal characterization of Lyapunov stability for this class of systems. We establish, in particular, a formal connection between multiple Lyapunov functions and techniques based on memorization and/or prediction of the discrete part of the state. This allows us to provide an equivalent (single) Lyapunov function, for any given multiple-Lyapunov criterion. By leveraging our language-theoretic formalism, a new class of stability conditions is then obtained when considering both memory and future values of the state in a joint fashion, providing new numerical schemes that outperform existing technique. Our techniques are then illustrated on numerical examples.",
