	abstract = {Computational chemistry is the leading application to demonstrate the advantage of quantum computing in the near term. However, large-scale simulation of chemical systems on quantum computers is currently hindered due to a mismatch between the computational resource needs of the program and those available in today's technology. In this paper we argue that significant new optimizations can be discovered by co-designing the application, compiler, and hardware. We show that multiple optimization objectives can be coordinated through the key abstraction layer of Pauli strings, which are the basic building blocks of computational chemistry programs. In particular, we leverage Pauli strings to identify critical program components that can be used to compress program size with minimal loss of accuracy. We also leverage the structure of Pauli string simulation circuits to tailor a novel hardware architecture and compiler, leading to significant execution overhead reduction by up to 99\%. While exploiting the high-level domain knowledge reveals significant optimization opportunities, our hardware/software framework is not tied to a particular program instance and can accommodate the full family of computational chemistry problems with such structure. We believe the co-design lessons of this study can be extended to other domains and hardware technologies to hasten the onset of quantum advantage.},

Quantum applications are programmed using the quantum software and then executed on the quantum hardware. However, the performance of existing quantum computing system is still limited. Solving a practical problem that is beyond the capability of classical computers on a quantum computer has not yet been demonstrated. In this review, we point out that the quantum software and hardware systems should be designed collaboratively to fully exploit the potential of quantum computing. We first review three related works, including one hardware-aware quantum compiler optimization, one application-aware quantum hardware architecture design flow, and one co-design approach for the emerging quantum computational chemistry. Then we discuss some potential future directions following the co-design principle.},

However, training such variational quantum algorithms suffers from gradient vanishing as the size of the algorithm increases. Previous work cannot handle the gradient vanishing induced by the inevitable noise effects on realistic quantum hardware. In this paper, we propose a novel training scheme to mitigate such noise-induced gradient vanishing. We first introduce a new cost function of which the gradients are significantly augmented by employing traceless observables in truncated subspace. We then prove that the same minimum can be reached by optimizing the original cost function with the gradients from the new cost function. Experiments show that our new training scheme is highly effective for major variational quantum algorithms of various tasks.},

Quantum Machine Learning, and Parameterized Quantum Circuits in a hybrid quantum-classical setup in particular, could bring advancements in accuracy by utilizing the high dimensionality of the Hilbert space as feature space. But is the ability of a quantum circuit to uniformly address the Hilbert space a good indicator of classification accuracy? In our work, we use methods and quantifications from prior art to perform a numerical study in order to evaluate the level of correlation. We find a strong correlation between the ability of the circuit to uniformly address the Hilbert space and the achieved classification accuracy for circuits that entail a single embedding layer followed by 1 or 2 circuit designs. This is based on our study encompassing 19 circuits in both 1 and 2 layer configuration, evaluated on 9 datasets of increasing difficulty. Future work will evaluate if this holds for different circuit designs.},

	title = {Robust resource-efficient quantum variational ansatz through evolutionary algorithm},
	abstract = {Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) are promising methods to demonstrate quantum advantage on near-term devices as the required resources are divided between a quantum simulator and a classical optimizer. As such, designing a VQA which is resource-efficient and robust against noise is a key factor to achieve potential advantage with the existing noisy quantum simulators. It turns out that a fixed VQA circuit design, such as the widely-used hardware efficient ansatz, is not necessarily robust against imperfections. In this work, we propose a genome-length-adjustable evolutionary algorithm to design a robust VQA circuit that is optimized over variations of both circuit ansatz and gate parameters, without any prior assumptions on circuit structure or depth. Remarkably, our method not only generates a noise-effect-minimized circuit with shallow depth, but also accelerates the classical optimization by substantially reducing the number of parameters. In this regard, the optimized circuit is far more resource-efficient with respect to both quantum and classical resources. As applications, based on two typical error models in VQA, we apply our method to calculating the ground energy of the hydrogen molecule and the Heisenberg model. Simulations suggest that compared with conventional hardware efficient ansatz, our circuit-structure-tunable method can generate circuits apparently more robust against both coherent and incoherent noise, and hence more likely to be implemented on near-term devices.},

	abstract = {Machine learning is frequently listed among the most promising applications for quantum computing. This is in fact a curious choice: Today's machine learning algorithms are notoriously powerful in practice, but remain theoretically difficult to study. Quantum computing, in contrast, does not offer practical benchmarks on realistic scales, and theory is the main tool we have to judge whether it could become relevant for a problem. In this perspective we explain why it is so difficult to say something about the practical power of quantum computers for machine learning with the tools we are currently using. We argue that these challenges call for a critical debate on whether quantum advantage and the narrative of 'beating' classical machine learning should continue to dominate the literature the way it does, and highlight examples for how other perspectives in existing research provide an important alternative to the focus on advantage.},

Such hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are popular for applications in quantum simulation, optimization, and machine learning. Due to its simplicity and hardware efficiency, random circuits are often proposed as initial guesses for exploring the space of quantum states. We show that the exponential dimension of Hilbert space and the gradient estimation complexity make this choice unsuitable for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms run on more than a few qubits. Specifically, we show that for a wide class of reasonable parameterized quantum circuits, the probability that the gradient along any reasonable direction is non-zero to some fixed precision is exponentially small as a function of the number of qubits. We argue that this is related to the 2-design characteristic of random circuits, and that solutions to this problem must be studied.},

	abstract = {Machine learning and quantum computing are two technologies that each have the potential to alter how computation is performed to address previously untenable problems. Kernel methods for machine learning are ubiquitous in pattern recognition, with support vector machines ({SVMs}) being the best known method for classification problems. However, there are limitations to the successful solution to such classification problems when the feature space becomes large, and the kernel functions become computationally expensive to estimate. A core element in the computational speed-ups enabled by quantum algorithms is the exploitation of an exponentially large quantum state space through controllable entanglement and interference. Here we propose and experimentally implement two quantum algorithms on a superconducting processor. A key component in both methods is the use of the quantum state space as feature space. The use of a quantum-enhanced feature space that is only efficiently accessible on a quantum computer provides a possible path to quantum advantage. The algorithms solve a problem of supervised learning: the construction of a classifier. One method, the quantum variational classifier, uses a variational quantum circuit1,2 to classify the data in a way similar to the method of conventional {SVMs}. The other method, a quantum kernel estimator, estimates the kernel function on the quantum computer and optimizes a classical {SVM}. The two methods provide tools for exploring the applications of noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers3 to machine learning.},

	abstract = {The manipulation of neutral atoms by light is at the heart of countless scientific discoveries in the field of quantum physics in the last three decades. The level of control that has been achieved at the single particle level within arrays of optical traps, while preserving the fundamental properties of quantum matter (coherence, entanglement, superposition), makes these technologies prime candidates to implement disruptive computation paradigms. In this paper, we review the main characteristics of these devices from atoms / qubits to application interfaces, and propose a classification of a wide variety of tasks that can already be addressed in a computationally efficient manner in the Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum era we are in. We illustrate how applications ranging from optimization challenges to simulation of quantum systems can be explored either at the digital level (programming gate-based circuits) or at the analog level (programming Hamiltonian sequences). We give evidence of the intrinsic scalability of neutral atom quantum processors in the 100-1,000 qubits range and introduce prospects for universal fault tolerant quantum computing and applications beyond quantum computing.},

The low-level nature of Pulser makes it a versatile framework for quantum control both in the digital and analog settings. The library also contains simulation routines for studying and exploring the outcome of pulse sequences for small systems.},
