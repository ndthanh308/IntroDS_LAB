	abstract = {It is shown that low-energy string theory admits a variety of solutions with the structure of an extended object surrounded by an event horizon. In particular there is a family of black string solutions, labelled by the mass and axion charge per unit length, corresponding to a string in ten dimensions surrounded by an event horizon. The extremal member of this family is the known supersymmetric singular solution corresponding to a macroscopic fundamental string. A similar family of solutions is found describing a fivebrane surrounded by an event horizon, whose extremal member is a previously discovered non-singular supersymmetric fivebrane. Additional charged, extended black hole solutions are presented for each of the antisymmetric tensors that arise in heterotic and type {II} string theories.},

	abstract = {By fast Lyapunov indicator ({FLI}), we study the chaotic dynamics of closed string around charged black brane with hyperscaling violation ({HV}). The Hawking temperature, Lifshitz dynamical exponent and {HV} exponent together affect the chaotic dynamics of this system. The temperature plays the role of driving the closed string to escape to infinity. There is a threshold value \$z\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\}=2\$, below which the string is captured by the black brane no matter where the string is placed at the beginning. However, when \$z{\textgreater}2\$, the string escapes to infinity if it is placed near the black brane at the beginning, but if the initial position of string is far away from the black brane, it oscillates around the black brane till eternity, which is a quasi-periodic motion. {HV} exponent plays the role of driving the string falling into the black brane. With the increase of {HV} exponent \${\textbackslash}theta\$, the falling velocity becomes faster. We find that when we heat the system with large {HV} exponent, the chaotic system does not essentially changes. It indicates that the {HV} exponent plays a very important role in determining the state of the chaotic system. Also we study the the effect from the winding number of the string. The study indicates that the chaotic dynamics of the string is insensitive to the winding number.},

Sensitivity to initial conditions in chaotic systems suggests that the string under chaos tends to stretch in the {AdS} soliton spacetime in a Lyapunov timescale. In this process, the orbital angular momentum transfers to internal spin due to the turbulence on the string. It follows that the string stays around the tip of the {AdS} soliton with a jumbled profile.

Perhaps one of the most surprising discoveries is a realization that the properties of higher-dimensional black holes with the spherical horizon topology and described by the Kerr-{NUT}-(A){dS} metrics are very similar to the properties of the well known four-dimensional Kerr metric. This remarkable result stems from the existence of a single object called the principal tensor. In our review we discuss explicit and hidden symmetries of higher-dimensional black holes. We start with the overview of the Liouville theory of completely integrable systems and introduce Killing and Killing-Yano objects representing explicit and hidden symmetries. We demonstrate that the principal tensor can be used as a `seed object' which generates all these symmetries. It determines the form of the black hole geometry, as well as guarantees its remarkable properties, such as special algebraic type of the spacetime, complete integrability of geodesic motion, and separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi, Klein-Gordon, and Dirac equations. The review also contains a discussion of different applications of the developed formalism and its possible generalizations.},

In this paper, we investigate the chaos bound in the the near-horizon region and at a certain distance from the horizon of a charged Kiselev black hole. The value of the Lyapunov exponent is accurately calculated by a Jacobian matrix. The angular momentum of a charged particle around the black hole affects not only the exponent, but also the position of the equilibrium orbit. This position gradually moves away from the horizon with the increase of the angular momentum. We find that the the bound is violated at a certain distance from the horizon and there is no violation in the near-horizon region when the charge mass ratio of the particle is fixed. The small value of the normalization factor is more likely to cause the violation.},

The entropy of extremal non-dilatonic \$p\$-branes is non-vanishing only for the solutions preserving 1/8 of the original supersymmetries. Upon toroidal compactification these reduce to dyonic black holes in 4 and 5 dimensions. For the self-dual string in 6 dimensions, which preserves 1/4 of the original supersymmetries, the near-extremal entropy is found to agree with a world sheet calculation, in support of the existing literature. The remaining 3 interesting cases preserve 1/2 of the original supersymmetries. These are the self-dual 3-brane in 10 dimensions, and the 2- and 5-branes in 11 dimensions.

The leading term of the scrambling time for a black hole with large entropy is logarithmic in the entropy and hence supports the fast scrambling conjecture for this black hole solution, which implies that the system under consideration is chaotic. We also find that the instantaneous minimal Lyapunov index is bounded by \${\textbackslash}kappa=2{\textbackslash}pi T\_H/(1-{\textbackslash}mu{\textbackslash}mathcal\{L\})\$, which is analogous to the surface gravity but for the rotating shock waves, and becomes closer to equality for the near extremal black hole. For a small value of the {AdS} scale, we found that the Lyapunov exponent can exceed the bound for a large value of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{L\}\$. Due to the presence of the electric and magnetic charge of the shock waves, we also show that the scrambling process of this holographic system is delayed by a time scale that depends on the charges of the shock waves. The calculations also hold for the ultra-spinning version of this black hole. The result of this paper generalizes the holographic calculations of chaotic systems which are described by an {EMDA} theory in the bulk.},

Analytical estimates from the linearized variational equations together with numerical integrations predict the bulk Lyapunov exponent value as λ ≈ 2πT n, where n is the winding number of the string. The celebrated bound on chaos stating that λ ≤ 2πT is thus systematically modiﬁed for winding strings in the bulk. Within gauge/string duality, such strings apparently correspond to complicated operators which either do not move on Regge trajectories, or move on subleading trajectories with an unusual slope. Depending on the energy scale, the out-of-time-ordered correlation functions of these operators may still obey the bound 2πT , or they may violate it like the bulk exponent. We do not know exactly why the bound on chaos can be modiﬁed but the indication from the gauge/string dual viewpoint is that the correlation functions of the dual gauge operators never factorize and thus the original derivation of the bound on chaos does not apply.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we make a systematical and in-depth study on the chaotic dynamics of the string around the conformal black hole. Depending on the characteristic parameter of the conformal black hole and the initial position of the string, there are three kinds of dynamical behaviors: ordered, chaotic and being captured, chaotic but not being captured. A particular interesting observation is that there is a sharp transition in chaotic dynamics when the black hole horizon disappears, which is indepent of the initial position of the string. It provides a possible way to probe the horizon structure of the massive body. We also examine the generalized {MSS} (Maldacena, Shenker and Stanford) inequality, which is proposed in holographic dual field theory, and find that the generalized {MSS} inequality holds even in the asymptotically flat black hole background. Especially, as the initial position of the string approaches the black hole horizon, the Lyapunov exponent also approaches the upper bound of the generalized {MSS} inequality.},

It is known that chaotic solutions appear on \$R\textbackslash times T\^\{1,1\}\$, depending on initial conditions. It may be interesting to ask whether the chaos persists even in Penrose limits or not. In this paper, we show that sub-leading corrections in a Penrose limit provide an unstable separatrix, so that chaotic motions are generated as a consequence of collapsed Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) tori. Our analysis is based on deriving a reduced system composed of two degrees of freedom by supposing a winding string ansatz. Then, we provide support for the existence of chaos by computing Poincare sections. In comparison to the AdS\$\_5\textbackslash times T\^\{1,1\}\$ case, we argue that no chaos lives in a near Penrose limit of AdS\$\_5\textbackslash times\$S\$\^5\$, as expected from the classical integrability of the parent system.},

This is a deep and central issue in holography. Here we investigate similar classical integrability for a more realistic confining background and provide a negative answer. The dynamics of a class of simple string configurations in AdS soliton background can be mapped to the dynamics of a set of non-linearly coupled oscillators. In a suitable limit of small fluctuations we discuss a quasi-periodic analytic solution of the system. However numerics indicates chaotic behavior as the fluctuations are not small. Integrability implies the existence of a regular foliation of the phase space by invariant manifolds. Our numerics shows how this nice foliation structure is eventually lost due to chaotic motion. We also verify a positive Lyapunov index for chaotic orbits. Our dynamics is roughly similar to other known non-integrable coupled oscillators systems like Henon-Heiles equations.},

Our nonlinear numerical simulation of the suspended Nambu-Goto string shows chaos, which would be absent in pure AdS background.

In particular, we consider strings on the AdS\_5 x S\^5 background and perform T-duality along the four isometry directions of AdS\_5 in the Poincare patch. The T-dual of the AdS\_5 sigma model is again a sigma model on an AdS\_5 space. This classical T-duality relation was used in the recently uncovered connection between light-like Wilson loops and MHV gluon scattering amplitudes in the strong coupling limit of the AdS/CFT duality. We show that the explicit coordinate dependence along the T-duality directions of the associated Lax connection (flat current) can be eliminated by means of a field dependent gauge transformation. As a result, the gauge equivalent Lax connection can easily be T-dualized, i.e. written in terms of the dual set of isometric coordinates. The T-dual Lax connection can be used for the derivation of infinitely many conserved charges in the T-dual model. Our construction implies that local (Noether) charges of the original model are mapped to non-local charges of the T-dual model and vice versa.},

We begin with a pedagogical introduction to integrable field theories culminating in the description of their finite-volume spectra through the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz. Next, we apply these ideas to the AdS\_5 x S\^5 string and in later chapters discuss how to account for particular integrable deformations. Through the AdS/CFT correspondence this gives an exact description of anomalous scaling dimensions of single trace operators in planar N=4 supersymmetry Yang-Mills theory, its `orbifolds', and beta and gamma-deformed supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We also touch upon some subtleties arising in these deformed theories. Furthermore, we consider complex excited states (bound states) in the su(2) sector and give their thermodynamic Bethe ansatz description. Finally we discuss the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz for a quantum deformation of the AdS\_5 x S\^5 superstring S-matrix, with close relations to among others Pohlmeyer reduced string theory, and briefly indicate more recent developments in this area.},

We start by revisiting conclusions from earlier studies on string motion in \$(\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\textbackslash times S\^3)\_\{\textbackslash eta\}\$ and \$(AdS\_3)\_\{\textbackslash eta\}\$ and then move on to more complex problems of \$(\textbackslash mathbb\{R\}\textbackslash times S\^5)\_\{\textbackslash eta\}\$ and \$(AdS\_5)\_\{\textbackslash eta\}\$. Discussing both analytically and numerically, we deduce that while \$(AdS\_5)\_\{\textbackslash eta\}\$ strings do not encounter any irregular trajectories, string motion in the deformed five-sphere can indeed, quite surprisingly, run into chaotic trajectories.

By examining string motion on the geometries corresponding to backreacted D3/D7 and D2/D6 systems, we show that integrable theories with quenched flavor become non-integrable when the virtual quark loops are taken into account. For the string solutions in the backreacted D3/D7 system, we compute the leading Lyapunov exponent which turns out to saturate to a positive value as the number of flavors increases. The exponent depends very weakly on the number of flavors when they approach the number of colors. This suggests that once a particular flavor number in the theory is reached, a further increase does not lead to more severe chaotic phenomena, implying certain saturation effects on chaos.},

For the hyperscaling violation theories we conclude that the vast majority of theories are non-integrable, while only for a small class of physical theories, where the Fermi surfaces belong to, integrability is not excluded. Schrodinger theories are also analyzed and a necessary condition for non-integrability is found.

The first-order non-integrability criterion, obtained by the first and second authors using only first variational equations, is extended to higher orders by the present criterion. Using this result (at order two, three or higher) it is possible to solve important open problems of integrability which escaped the first order criterion. Résumé Nous montrons qu'étant donné un système hamiltonien analytique complexe, une condition nécessaire pour qu'il soit méromorphiquement intégrable, au sens de Liouville, est que la composante connexe de l'identité du groupe de Galois différentiel de toute équation variationnelle, d'ordre arbitraire, le long de toute courbe intégrale, soit commutative. Ceci avait été conjecturé par le premier auteur, à la suite d'une suggestion du troisième, motivée par des observations numériques et analytiques sur des équations variationnelles d'ordre supérieur. Le critère présenté dans cet article étend aux équations d'ordre supérieur le critère de Morales–Ramis, obtenu antérieurement par les deux premiers auteurs, qui n'utilisait que la première équation variationnelle. Utilisant le nouveau critère (aux ordres deux, trois ou plus), il est possible de résoudre d'importants problèmes d'intégrabilité pour lesquels le critère de Morales–Ramis ne permettait pas de conclure.},

  abstract = {We analyze the motion of a \{\textbackslash it massless\} and \{\textbackslash it chargeless\} particle very near to the event horizon. It reveals that the radial motion has exponential growing nature which indicates that there is a possibility of inducing chaos in the particle motion of an integrable system when it comes under the influence of the horizon. This is being confirmed by investigating the Poincar\$\textbackslash acute\{e\}\$ section of the trajectories with the introduction of a harmonic trap to confine the particle's motion. Two situations are investigated: (a) \{\textbackslash it any\} static, spherically symmetric black hole and, (b) spacetime represents a stationary, axisymmetric black hole (e.g., Kerr metric). In both cases, the largest Lyapunov exponent has upper bound which is the surface gravity of the horizon. We find that the inclusion of rotation in the spacetime introduces more chaotic fluctuations in the system. The possible implications are finally discussed.},

  abstract = {We study the circular motion of charged particles near a charged black hole. The general form of the Lyapunov exponent of charged particles is obtained by using the Jacobian matrix. The results show that the chaos bound can be saturated by the circular motion of charged particles on the horizon. By further expanding the Lyapunov exponent near the horizon and investigating Reissner-Nordstr\textbackslash "om(RN) black holes with different \$M/Q\$, we find that in contrast to the static equilibrium, the circular motion of charged particles can have a larger Lyapunov exponent due to the existence of angular momentum. For the RN black holes which have the mass-charge ratio \$1},
