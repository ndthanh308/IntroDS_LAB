	abstract = {It is shown that low-energy string theory admits a variety of solutions with the structure of an extended object surrounded by an event horizon. In particular there is a family of black string solutions, labelled by the mass and axion charge per unit length, corresponding to a string in ten dimensions surrounded by an event horizon. The extremal member of this family is the known supersymmetric singular solution corresponding to a macroscopic fundamental string. A similar family of solutions is found describing a fivebrane surrounded by an event horizon, whose extremal member is a previously discovered non-singular supersymmetric fivebrane. Additional charged, extended black hole solutions are presented for each of the antisymmetric tensors that arise in heterotic and type {II} string theories.},

	abstract = {By fast Lyapunov indicator ({FLI}), we study the chaotic dynamics of closed string around charged black brane with hyperscaling violation ({HV}). The Hawking temperature, Lifshitz dynamical exponent and {HV} exponent together affect the chaotic dynamics of this system. The temperature plays the role of driving the closed string to escape to infinity. There is a threshold value \$z\_\{{\textbackslash}ast\}=2\$, below which the string is captured by the black brane no matter where the string is placed at the beginning. However, when \$z{\textgreater}2\$, the string escapes to infinity if it is placed near the black brane at the beginning, but if the initial position of string is far away from the black brane, it oscillates around the black brane till eternity, which is a quasi-periodic motion. {HV} exponent plays the role of driving the string falling into the black brane. With the increase of {HV} exponent \${\textbackslash}theta\$, the falling velocity becomes faster. We find that when we heat the system with large {HV} exponent, the chaotic system does not essentially changes. It indicates that the {HV} exponent plays a very important role in determining the state of the chaotic system. Also we study the the effect from the winding number of the string. The study indicates that the chaotic dynamics of the string is insensitive to the winding number.},

Sensitivity to initial conditions in chaotic systems suggests that the string under chaos tends to stretch in the {AdS} soliton spacetime in a Lyapunov timescale. In this process, the orbital angular momentum transfers to internal spin due to the turbulence on the string. It follows that the string stays around the tip of the {AdS} soliton with a jumbled profile.

Perhaps one of the most surprising discoveries is a realization that the properties of higher-dimensional black holes with the spherical horizon topology and described by the Kerr-{NUT}-(A){dS} metrics are very similar to the properties of the well known four-dimensional Kerr metric. This remarkable result stems from the existence of a single object called the principal tensor. In our review we discuss explicit and hidden symmetries of higher-dimensional black holes. We start with the overview of the Liouville theory of completely integrable systems and introduce Killing and Killing-Yano objects representing explicit and hidden symmetries. We demonstrate that the principal tensor can be used as a `seed object' which generates all these symmetries. It determines the form of the black hole geometry, as well as guarantees its remarkable properties, such as special algebraic type of the spacetime, complete integrability of geodesic motion, and separability of the Hamilton-Jacobi, Klein-Gordon, and Dirac equations. The review also contains a discussion of different applications of the developed formalism and its possible generalizations.},

In this paper, we investigate the chaos bound in the the near-horizon region and at a certain distance from the horizon of a charged Kiselev black hole. The value of the Lyapunov exponent is accurately calculated by a Jacobian matrix. The angular momentum of a charged particle around the black hole affects not only the exponent, but also the position of the equilibrium orbit. This position gradually moves away from the horizon with the increase of the angular momentum. We find that the the bound is violated at a certain distance from the horizon and there is no violation in the near-horizon region when the charge mass ratio of the particle is fixed. The small value of the normalization factor is more likely to cause the violation.},

The entropy of extremal non-dilatonic \$p\$-branes is non-vanishing only for the solutions preserving 1/8 of the original supersymmetries. Upon toroidal compactification these reduce to dyonic black holes in 4 and 5 dimensions. For the self-dual string in 6 dimensions, which preserves 1/4 of the original supersymmetries, the near-extremal entropy is found to agree with a world sheet calculation, in support of the existing literature. The remaining 3 interesting cases preserve 1/2 of the original supersymmetries. These are the self-dual 3-brane in 10 dimensions, and the 2- and 5-branes in 11 dimensions.

Hence, the bound is more effective in the {AdS} spacetime than in the flat spacetime. Nevertheless, we find that the bound can be violated when the angular momenta of the black hole are turned on. Moreover, we show that in an extremal black hole, the bound is more easily violated compared to the nonextremal black hole.},

The leading term of the scrambling time for a black hole with large entropy is logarithmic in the entropy and hence supports the fast scrambling conjecture for this black hole solution, which implies that the system under consideration is chaotic. We also find that the instantaneous minimal Lyapunov index is bounded by \${\textbackslash}kappa=2{\textbackslash}pi T\_H/(1-{\textbackslash}mu{\textbackslash}mathcal\{L\})\$, which is analogous to the surface gravity but for the rotating shock waves, and becomes closer to equality for the near extremal black hole. For a small value of the {AdS} scale, we found that the Lyapunov exponent can exceed the bound for a large value of \${\textbackslash}mathcal\{L\}\$. Due to the presence of the electric and magnetic charge of the shock waves, we also show that the scrambling process of this holographic system is delayed by a time scale that depends on the charges of the shock waves. The calculations also hold for the ultra-spinning version of this black hole. The result of this paper generalizes the holographic calculations of chaotic systems which are described by an {EMDA} theory in the bulk.},

Analytical estimates from the linearized variational equations together with numerical integrations predict the bulk Lyapunov exponent value as λ ≈ 2πT n, where n is the winding number of the string. The celebrated bound on chaos stating that λ ≤ 2πT is thus systematically modiﬁed for winding strings in the bulk. Within gauge/string duality, such strings apparently correspond to complicated operators which either do not move on Regge trajectories, or move on subleading trajectories with an unusual slope. Depending on the energy scale, the out-of-time-ordered correlation functions of these operators may still obey the bound 2πT , or they may violate it like the bulk exponent. We do not know exactly why the bound on chaos can be modiﬁed but the indication from the gauge/string dual viewpoint is that the correlation functions of the dual gauge operators never factorize and thus the original derivation of the bound on chaos does not apply.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we make a systematical and in-depth study on the chaotic dynamics of the string around the conformal black hole. Depending on the characteristic parameter of the conformal black hole and the initial position of the string, there are three kinds of dynamical behaviors: ordered, chaotic and being captured, chaotic but not being captured. A particular interesting observation is that there is a sharp transition in chaotic dynamics when the black hole horizon disappears, which is indepent of the initial position of the string. It provides a possible way to probe the horizon structure of the massive body. We also examine the generalized {MSS} (Maldacena, Shenker and Stanford) inequality, which is proposed in holographic dual field theory, and find that the generalized {MSS} inequality holds even in the asymptotically flat black hole background. Especially, as the initial position of the string approaches the black hole horizon, the Lyapunov exponent also approaches the upper bound of the generalized {MSS} inequality.},
