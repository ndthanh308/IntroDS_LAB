  "abstract": "We consider a pulsating string near a non-extremal black p-brane (p=5 and p=6) and investigate the chaos in the corresponding string dynamics by examining the Fast Lyapunov indicator(FLI) and Poincare section. In our system, the energy and the charge play the role of control parameters. For generic values of these parameters, the numerical results show that the dynamics primarily fall into three modes: capture, escape to infinity, and quasiperiodic depending on the initial location (near to or far away from the black brane horizon) of the string. Finally, probing for different values of the winding number (n) the dynamics turns out to be sensitive to n. In particular, we observe the point particle (n=0) scenario to be integrable whereas at higher n the dynamics seems to be chaotic.",
