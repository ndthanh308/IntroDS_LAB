abstract = {In this paper, we propose and analyze a class of actor-critic algorithms. These ar two-time-scale algorithms in which the critic uses temporal difference (TD) learning with a linearly parameterized approximation architecture, and the actor is updated in an approximate gradient direction based on information provided by the critic. We show that the features for the critic should ideally span a subspace prescribed by the choice of parameterization of the actor. We study actorcritic algorithms for Markov decision processes with general state and action spaces. We state and prove two results regarding their convergence.},

abstract = {In this paper we consider deterministic policy gradient algorithms for reinforcement learning with continuous actions. The deterministic pol- icy gradient has a particularly appealing form: it is the expected gradient of the action-value func- tion. This simple form means that the deter- ministic policy gradient can be estimated much more efficiently than the usual stochastic pol- icy gradient. To ensure adequate exploration, we introduce an off-policy actor-critic algorithm that learns a deterministic target policy from an exploratory behaviour policy. We demonstrate that deterministic policy gradient algorithms can significantly outperform their stochastic counter- parts in high-dimensional action spaces.},
