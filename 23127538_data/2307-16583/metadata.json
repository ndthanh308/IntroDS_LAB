  "abstract": "In this paper, for any integer $k\\geq 2$, we study the distribution of the visible lattice points in certain generalized Pólya's walk on $\\mathbb{Z}^k$: perturbed Pólya's walk and twisted Pólya's walk. For the first case, we prove that the density of visible lattice points in a perturbed Pólya's walk is almost surely $1/ζ(k)$, where $ζ(s)$ denotes the Riemann zeta function. A trivial case of our result covers the standard Pólya's walk. Moreover, we do numerical experiments for the second case, we conjecture that the density is also almost surely $1/ζ(k)$.",
