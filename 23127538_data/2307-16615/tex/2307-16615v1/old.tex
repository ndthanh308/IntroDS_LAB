		In this paper, we investigate the well-posedness of the time-fractional Fokker--Planck equation.
Its dynamics are governed by anomalous diffusion, and
we describe the model's derivation from subordinated Langevin equations. 
As our primary result, we prove the existence of weak solutions to a class of time-fractional advection-diffusion PDEs including the time-fractional Fokker--Planck equation with space-time dependent force. In this regard, we derive an energy inequality by considering nonstandard and novel testing methods. Moreover, we also investigate the special cases of space- and time-independent forces. Lastly, we  propose a numerical algorithm based on the nonuniform L1 scheme and present some simulations results for various forces.
