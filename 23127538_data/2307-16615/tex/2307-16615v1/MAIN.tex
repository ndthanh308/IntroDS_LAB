%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we investigate the well-posedness of weak solutions to the time-fractio\-nal Fokker--Planck equation. Its dynamics is governed by anomalous diffusion, and we consider the most general case of space-time dependent forces. Consequently, the fractional derivatives appear on the right-hand side of the equation, and they cannot be brought to the left-hand side, which would have been preferable from an analytical perspective.  
For showing the model's well-posedness, we derive an energy inequality by considering nonstandard and novel testing methods that involve a series of convolutions and integrations. We close the estimate by a Henry--Gronwall-type inequality. Lastly, we  propose a numerical algorithm based on a nonuniform L1 scheme and present some simulation results for various forces.

\begin{abstract}
In this paper, we investigate the well-posedness of the time-fractional Fokker--Planck equation.
Its dynamics are governed by anomalous diffusion, and
we describe the model's derivation from subordinated Langevin equations. 
As our primary result, we prove the existence of weak solutions to a class of time-fractional advection-diffusion PDEs including the time-fractional Fokker--Planck equation with space-time dependent force. In this regard, we derive an energy inequality by considering nonstandard and novel testing methods. Lastly, we  propose a numerical algorithm based on a nonuniform L1 scheme and present some simulation results for various forces.
