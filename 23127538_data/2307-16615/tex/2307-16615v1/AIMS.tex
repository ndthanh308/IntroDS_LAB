%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{abstract}
In this work, we study a viscoelastic Cahn--Hilliard model. In contrast to other models, we propose a fractional viscoelastic equation based on the fractional laws accounting for memory effects. The laws are fractional counterparts of the well-known Kelvin--Voigt, Zener, and Maxwell models. This approach introduces a time-fractional derivative into the system, and we study the new system with respect to its well-posedness. Further, we investigate the equations numerically and explore the influence of the fractional derivative in the phase-field's evolution.
