  "abstract": "The gravitational form factors of a hadron are defined through the matrix elements of the energy-momentum tensor current, which can be decomposed into the quark and gluonic parts, between the hadronic states. These form factors provide important information for answering fundamental questions about the distribution of the energy, the spin, the pressure and the shear forces inside the hadrons. Theoretical and experimental studies of these form factors provide exciting insights on the inner structure and geometric shapes of hadrons. Inspired by this, the gravitational form factors of $Δ$ resonance are calculated by employing the QCD sum rule approach. The acquired gravitational form factors are used to calculate the composite gravitational form factors like the energy and angular momentum multipole form factors, D-terms related to the mechanical properties like the internal pressure and shear forces as well as the mass radius of the system. The predictions are compared with the existing results in the literature.",
