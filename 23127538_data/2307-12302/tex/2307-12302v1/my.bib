 NOTE={(A preliminary version of this work appeared as Cambridge Univ.

 ABSTRACT={New tools are presented for reasoning about properties of
 recursively defined domains. We work within a general,
 category-theoretic framework for various notions of `relation' on
 domains and for actions of domain constructors on relations.
 Freyd's analysis of recursive types in terms of a property of mixed
 initiality/finality is transferred to a corresponding property of
 {\em invariant\/} relations. The existence of invariant relations is
 proved under completeness assumptions about the notion of relation.
 We show how this leads to simpler proofs of the computational
 adequacy of denotational semantics for functional programming
 languages with user-declared datatypes.  We show how the
 initiality/finality property of invariant relations can be
 specialized to yield an induction principle for admissible subsets
 of recursively defined domains, generalizing the principle of
 structural induction for inductively defined sets. We also show how
 the initiality/finality property gives rise to the co-induction
 principle studied by the author ({\em Theoretical Computer
 Science\/} {\bf 124}, 195--219 (1994)), by which equalities
 between elements of recursively defined domains may be proved via an
 appropriate notion of `bisimulation'.}

a hierarchy within problems decidable in linear time by a 
first-order functional language based on tree-structured data (F),
as well as for an extension of that language based on 
graph-structured data (Fsu).
We consider the Categorical Abstract Machine (CAM), a canonical
machine model for implementing higher order functional languages.  We
show the existence of such a hierarchy for the CAM based on
tree-structured data (without selective updating facilities), as well
as in the case of graph-structured data (with selective updating). In
conclusion we establish two local robustness results where
first-order functional programs and higher order functional
programs define the same class of linear-time decidable problems.
