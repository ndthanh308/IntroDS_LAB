abstract = {Abstract The low-energy electronic excitations in graphene are described by massless Dirac fermions that have a linear dispersion relation. Taking advantage of this ‘optics-like’ electron dynamics, generic optical elements like lenses and wave guides have been proposed for electrons in graphene. Tuning of these elements relies on the ability to adjust the carrier concentration in defined areas. However, the combination of ballistic transport and complex gating remains challenging. Here we report on the fabrication and characterization of suspended graphene p–n junctions. By local gating, resonant cavities can be defined, leading to complex Fabry–Pérot interferences. The observed conductance oscillations account for quantum interference of electrons propagating ballistically over distances exceeding 1 μm. Visibility of the interferences is demonstrated to be enhanced by Klein collimation at the p–n interface. This finding paves the way to more complex gate-controlled ballistic graphene devices and brings electron optics in graphene closer to reality.},

	Abstract = {The discovery of graphene raises the prospect of a new class of nanoelectronic devices based on the extraordinary physical properties of this one-atom-thick layer of carbon. Unlike two-dimensional electron layers in semiconductors, where the charge carriers become immobile at low densities, the carrier mobility in graphene can remain high, even when their density vanishes at the Dirac point. However, when the graphene sample is supported on an insulating substrate, potential fluctuations induce charge puddles that obscure the Dirac point physics. Here we show that the fluctuations are significantly reduced in suspended graphene samples and we report low-temperature mobility approaching 200,000 cm2 V-1 s-1 for carrier densities below 5 x 109 cm-2. Such values cannot be attained in semiconductors or non-suspended graphene. Moreover, unlike graphene samples supported by a substrate, the conductivity of suspended graphene at the Dirac point is strongly dependent on temperature and approaches ballistic values at liquid helium temperatures. At higher temperatures, above 100 K, we observe the onset of thermally induced long-range scattering.},

    abstract = { The third order optical nonlinearity of graphene is theoretically investigated using the semiconductor Bloch equations under the independent particle approximation. The electronic states are described by a two band tight binding model, and the scattering is described by phenomenological parameters. For nominally weak optical fields, perturbation theory at zero temperature gives analytic expressions for the third order conductivities under the linear dispersion approximation around the Dirac points. These expressions show many singularities and divergences, which indicates a complex nonlinear optical behavior of graphene. We illustrate the dependence of several nonlinear optical effects, such as third harmonic generation, Kerr effects and two photon absorption, and parametric frequency conversion, on the relaxation parameters and temperature. The analytic results from perturbation theory, with the approximation employed, are verified by numerical solutions. The latter also allow us to discuss the effects of saturation on the optical nonlinearity. The results of the independent particle theory presented here are smaller than the values extracted from experiments by at least two orders of magnitude. },

journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {The transient optical conductivity of freely suspended graphene was examined by femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopy using pump excitation at 400 nm and probe radiation at 800 nm. The optical conductivity (or, equivalently, absorption) changes abruptly upon excitation and subsequently relaxes to its initial value on the time scale of 1 ps. The form of the induced change in the optical conductivity varies strongly with excitation conditions, exhibiting a crossover from enhanced to decreased optical conductivity with increasing pump fluence. We describe the graphene response in terms of transient heating of the electrons, with the characteristic relaxation time of the transient conductivity reflecting the cooling of the electron system and the strongly coupled optical phonons through emission of lower energy phonons. The change in the optical conductivity is attributed to a combination of induced absorption from intra-band transitions of the photo-generated carriers and bleaching of the inter-band transitions by Pauli blocking. The former effect, which corresponds to the high-frequency wing of the Drude response, dominates at low pump fluence. In this regime of a limited rise in the electron temperature, an increase in the optical conductivity is observed. At high pump fluence, elevated electron temperatures are achieved. The decrease in the inter-band bleaching then dominates the transient response, the intra-band contribution being overwhelmed despite an increase in the Drude scattering rate with temperature. The temporal evolution of the optical conductivity in all the regimes can be described within a model including the intra- and inter-band contributions with a time-varying electronic temperature. An increased Drude scattering rate is inferred for high electron temperature and mechanisms for this enhancement are considered. The calculated scattering rate for interactions of the carriers with zone-center and zone-edge optical phonons agrees well with the rates obtained from experiment.}

journal = {Materials Research Express},
abstract = {In this study, using the calculations of the first principle, the effects of metal impurities of Cr and Mn with different impurities percentages are investigated on the structural, electronic and optical properties of graphene-like MoSe2. The calculations show, doping by impurities causes to obtain the more stable compounds. It also reduces the band gap about a few tenths eV compared to their pure composition. Impurities can also cause the direct gap to move from one point to another one or depending on the impurity type causes the compound nature changes from a semiconductor to a magnetic half-metal. Another important finding of this study is that as the type and percentage of impurity affect the electronic properties, they can also influence the degree of change in optical properties such as the expansion of spectrum, the reduction of the peaks and their integration. Although we can predict based on the previous study, the process of increasing the percentage of impurities leads to loss of some peaks, it seems, ultimately leads to an increase in the total absorption of the electromagnetic spectrum. Compared to the pure compound, the impure compounds exhibit similar structural properties but depict unique electronic and optical properties that can be used in nano-parts, nano-electronics as well as in the absorber plates of solar cells and optical instruments and so on.}

abstract = {Summary We give a brief survey on the transport theory for graphene in the absence of an external magnetic field. Electronic properties of mono- and bilayer graphene are strongly related to the existence of a quasiparticle spectrum which consists of two bands that touch each other at two Dirac nodes. This structure is associated with a number of interesting features, such as Klein tunneling and electron–hole pair creation. This leads to robust transport properties, including minimal conductivity and constant optical conductivity over a wide range of frequencies, clearly indicating a deviation from conventional Drude-type transport. Moreover, recent experimental studies have revealed that the sublattice symmetry of the honeycomb lattice can be broken by chemical doping or by external gates in the case of bilayers. The broken symmetry opens a random gap in the quasiparticle spectrum, which may lead to an insulating behavior. We discuss diffusion in graphene, which implies a characteristic metallic behavior in mono- and bilayer graphene, and the AC conductivity. The properties of the latter deviate substantially from that of a conventional metal. The behavior of plasmons in graphene, on the other hand, is similar to that of plasmons in a conventional two-dimensional electron gas.}
