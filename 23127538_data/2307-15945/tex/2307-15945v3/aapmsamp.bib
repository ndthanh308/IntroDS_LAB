abstract = {Abstract The low-energy electronic excitations in graphene are described by massless Dirac fermions that have a linear dispersion relation. Taking advantage of this ‘optics-like’ electron dynamics, generic optical elements like lenses and wave guides have been proposed for electrons in graphene. Tuning of these elements relies on the ability to adjust the carrier concentration in defined areas. However, the combination of ballistic transport and complex gating remains challenging. Here we report on the fabrication and characterization of suspended graphene p–n junctions. By local gating, resonant cavities can be defined, leading to complex Fabry–Pérot interferences. The observed conductance oscillations account for quantum interference of electrons propagating ballistically over distances exceeding 1 μm. Visibility of the interferences is demonstrated to be enhanced by Klein collimation at the p–n interface. This finding paves the way to more complex gate-controlled ballistic graphene devices and brings electron optics in graphene closer to reality.},

	Abstract = {The discovery of graphene raises the prospect of a new class of nanoelectronic devices based on the extraordinary physical properties of this one-atom-thick layer of carbon. Unlike two-dimensional electron layers in semiconductors, where the charge carriers become immobile at low densities, the carrier mobility in graphene can remain high, even when their density vanishes at the Dirac point. However, when the graphene sample is supported on an insulating substrate, potential fluctuations induce charge puddles that obscure the Dirac point physics. Here we show that the fluctuations are significantly reduced in suspended graphene samples and we report low-temperature mobility approaching 200,000 cm2 V-1 s-1 for carrier densities below 5 x 109 cm-2. Such values cannot be attained in semiconductors or non-suspended graphene. Moreover, unlike graphene samples supported by a substrate, the conductivity of suspended graphene at the Dirac point is strongly dependent on temperature and approaches ballistic values at liquid helium temperatures. At higher temperatures, above 100 K, we observe the onset of thermally induced long-range scattering.},

In this limit analytic formulas can be constructed for the conductivities. We discuss in detail the results for third harmonic generation, the Kerr effect and two-photon carrier injection, parametric frequency conversion, and two-color coherent current injection. We find a complicated dependence on the chemical potential and photon energies. The linear dispersion causes resonances over a wide range of photon energies, and it is possible to obtain large optical nonlinearities by tuning the chemical potential.}

journal = {New Journal of Physics},
abstract = {The transient optical conductivity of freely suspended graphene was examined by femtosecond time-resolved spectroscopy using pump excitation at 400 nm and probe radiation at 800 nm. The optical conductivity (or, equivalently, absorption) changes abruptly upon excitation and subsequently relaxes to its initial value on the time scale of 1 ps. The form of the induced change in the optical conductivity varies strongly with excitation conditions, exhibiting a crossover from enhanced to decreased optical conductivity with increasing pump fluence. We describe the graphene response in terms of transient heating of the electrons, with the characteristic relaxation time of the transient conductivity reflecting the cooling of the electron system and the strongly coupled optical phonons through emission of lower energy phonons. The change in the optical conductivity is attributed to a combination of induced absorption from intra-band transitions of the photo-generated carriers and bleaching of the inter-band transitions by Pauli blocking. The former effect, which corresponds to the high-frequency wing of the Drude response, dominates at low pump fluence. In this regime of a limited rise in the electron temperature, an increase in the optical conductivity is observed. At high pump fluence, elevated electron temperatures are achieved. The decrease in the inter-band bleaching then dominates the transient response, the intra-band contribution being overwhelmed despite an increase in the Drude scattering rate with temperature. The temporal evolution of the optical conductivity in all the regimes can be described within a model including the intra- and inter-band contributions with a time-varying electronic temperature. An increased Drude scattering rate is inferred for high electron temperature and mechanisms for this enhancement are considered. The calculated scattering rate for interactions of the carriers with zone-center and zone-edge optical phonons agrees well with the rates obtained from experiment.}
