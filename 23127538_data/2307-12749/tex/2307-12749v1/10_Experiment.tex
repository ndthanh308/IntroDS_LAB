\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:exp}
In this section, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of \system, comparing it to alternative approaches. Note that these experiments are conducted under the assumption of no system failures during runtime. Providing efficient fault tolerance without compromising low latency and high throughput during normal operation poses a significant challenge for TSPEs, even in a single-node setting. This complexity arises from the intricate interplay of transactional and stream-oriented properties that TSPEs exhibit. The challenge could potentially magnify in a distributed environment. Enhancements for \system's fault tolerance are a subject of our separate, forthcoming work.
% In this section, we conduct a detailed experimental evaluation comparing \system to the alternative approaches. Note that, we assume there is no system failure at runtime. Guaranteeing fault tolerance without sacrificing low latency and high throughput during normal operation is still an open challenge for TSPEs~\cite{S-Store,tstream,AFFETTI202065}.
% This is a challenging problem even in a single node setting because of the non-trivial combination of both transaction and stream-oriented properties in TSPEs. We leave the fault tolerance enhancement of \system in a separate work.

In summary, we have made the following key observations.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Our experimental results show that \system outperforms conventional SPEs for TSP applications (Section~\ref{subsubsec:conventional}) by orders of magnitude. Because of the adaptive scheduling strategy, \system achieves up to 2.2x higher throughput and 69.1\% lower latency compared to the state-of-the-art TSPEs (Section~\ref{subsubsec:dynamic} and~\ref{subsubsec:mutiple}).
    \myc{Moreover, we also evaluate the performance of executing window non-deterministic queries on \system in Section~\ref{subsubsec:window_exp} and~\ref{subsubsec:nondeterministic_exp}.}
    \item In Section~\ref{subsec:overhead}, we show that \system spends more time on \tpg construction and exploration, but largely reduces the overhead of synchronization. A drawback of \system, however, is its high memory consumption (about 1.4x times higher) due to the more complex auxiliary data structures.
    \item We show that no one scheduling strategy can outperform others in all cases (Section~\ref{subsec:scheduling_decision}). Each scheduling decision has its own advantages and disadvantages under varying workload characteristics.
    \item In Section~\ref{subsec:modern_hardware}, we show that \system spends up to 2.3x fewer clock ticks and has a lower memory bound than \tstream and \sstore. Furthermore, \system has much better multicore scalability compared to prior schemes. 
    \item \myc{In Section~\ref{subsec:use_cases}, we demonstrate the practical usefulness of \system with two case studies: \textit{Online Social Event Detection} and \textit{Stock Exchange Analysis}. Specifically, \system can react to emerging events and output expected results in sub-second level when processing real-world workloads.}
