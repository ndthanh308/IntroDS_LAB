	abstract     = {Lock managers are among the most studied components in concurrency control and transactional systems. However, one question seems to have been generally overlooked: "When there are multiple lock requests on the same object, which one(s) should be granted first?"Nearly all existing systems rely on a FIFO (first in, first out) strategy to decide which transaction(s) to grant the lock to. In this paper, however, we show that the lock scheduling choices have significant ramifications on the overall performance of a transactional system. Despite the large body of research on job scheduling outside the database context, lock scheduling presents subtle but challenging requirements that render existing results on scheduling inapt for a transactional database. By carefully studying this problem, we present the concept of contention-aware scheduling, show the hardness of the problem, and propose novel lock scheduling algorithms (LDSF and bLDSF), which guarantee a constant factor approximation of the best scheduling. We conduct extensive experiments using a popular database on both TPC-C and a microbenchmark. Compared to FIFO---the default scheduler in most database systems---our bLDSF algorithm yields up to 300x speedup in overall transaction latency. Alternatively, our LDSF algorithm, which is simpler and achieves comparable performance to bLDSF, has already been adopted by open-source community, and was chosen as the default scheduling strategy in MySQL 8.0.3+},

	abstract     = {Computer architectures are moving towards an era dominated by many-core machines with dozens or even hundreds of cores on a single chip. This unprecedented level of on-chip parallelism introduces a new dimension to scalability that current database management systems (DBMSs) were not designed for. In particular, as the number of cores increases, the problem of concurrency control becomes extremely challenging. With hundreds of threads running in parallel, the complexity of coordinating competing accesses to data will likely diminish the gains from increased core counts.To better understand just how unprepared current DBMSs are for future CPU architectures, we performed an evaluation of concurrency control for on-line transaction processing (OLTP) workloads on many-core chips. We implemented seven concurrency control algorithms on a main-memory DBMS and using computer simulations scaled our system to 1024 cores. Our analysis shows that all algorithms fail to scale to this magnitude but for different reasons. In each case, we identify fundamental bottlenecks that are independent of the particular database implementation and argue that even state-of-the-art DBMSs suffer from these limitations. We conclude that rather than pursuing incremental solutions, many-core chips may require a completely redesigned DBMS architecture that is built from ground up and is tightly coupled with the hardware.},

	abstract     = {A long-running analytic task on big data often leaves a developer in the dark without providing valuable feedback about the status of the execution. In addition, a failed job that needs to restart from scratch can waste earlier computing resources. An effective method to address these issues is to allow the developer to debug the task during its execution, which is unfortunately not supported by existing big data solutions. In this paper we develop a system called Amber that supports responsive debugging during the execution of a workflow task. After starting the execution, the developer can pause the job at will, investigate the states of the cluster, modify the job, and resume the computation. She can also set conditional breakpoints to pause the execution when certain conditions are satisfied. In this way, the developer can gain a much better understanding of the run-time behavior of the execution and more easily identify issues in the job or data. Amber is based on the actor model, a distributed computing paradigm that provides concurrent units of computation using actors. We give a full specification of Amber, and implement it on top of the Orleans system. Our experiments show its high performance and usability of debugging on computing clusters.},

Such applications not only call for large-scale analytics, but also for real-time streaming support, smaller analytics at interactive speeds, data visualization, and cross-storage-system queries. Guided by the principle that "one size does not fit all", we build on top of a variety of storage engines, each designed for a specialized use case. To illustrate the promise of this approach, we demonstrate its effectiveness on a hospital application using data from an intensive care unit (ICU). This complex application serves the needs of doctors and researchers and provides real-time support for streams of patient data. It showcases novel approaches for querying across multiple storage engines, data visualization, and scalable real-time analytics.},

Conventional indexing data structures optimized for frequent search queries on a prestored dataset do not meet the demands of indexing highly dynamic data as in streaming environments. In this paper, we introduce an index data structure, called the partitioned in-memory merge tree, to address the challenges that arise when indexing highly dynamic data, which are common in streaming settings. Utilizing the specific pattern of streaming data and the distribution of queries, we propose a low-cost and effective concurrency control mechanism to meet the demands of high-rate update queries. To complement the index, we design an algorithm to realize a parallel index-based stream join that exploits the computational power of multicore processors.

	abstract     = {Complex Event Processing (CEP) has emerged as a technology of choice for high performance event analytics in time-critical decision-making applications. Yet it is becoming increasingly difficult to support high-performance event processing due to the rising number and complexity of event pattern queries and the increasingly high velocity of event streams. In this work we design the SPASS framework that successfully tackles these demanding CEP workloads. Our SPASS optimizer identifies opportunities for effective shared processing among CEP queries by leveraging time-based event correlations among queries. The problem of pattern sharing is shown to be NP-hard by reducing the Minimum Substring Cover problem to our CEP pattern sharing problem. The SPASS optimizer is designed that finds a shared pattern plan in polynomial-time covering all sequence patterns while still guaranteeing an optimality bound. To execute this shared pattern plan, the SPASS runtime employs stream transactions that assure concurrent shared maintenance and re-use of sub-patterns across queries. Our experimental study confirms that the SPASS framework achieves over 16 fold performance improvement for a wide range of experiments compared to the state-of-the-art solution.},

	abstract     = {Continuous analytics systems that enable query processing over steams of data have emerged as key solutions for dealing with massive data volumes and demands for low latency. These systems have been heavily influenced by an assumption that data streams can be viewed as sequences of data that arrived more or less in order. The reality, however, is that streams are not often so well behaved and disruptions of various sorts are endemic. We argue, therefore, that stream processing needs a fundamental rethink and advocate a unified approach toward continuous analytics over discontinuous streaming data. Our approach is based on a simple insight - using techniques inspired by data parallel query processing, queries can be performed over independent sub-streams with arbitrary time ranges in parallel, generating partial results. The consolidation of the partial results over each sub-stream can then be deferred to the time at which the results are actually used on an on-demand basis. In this paper, we describe how the Truviso Continuous Analytics system implements this type of order-independent processing. Not only does the approach provide the first real solution to the problem of processing streaming data that arrives arbitrarily late, it also serves as a critical building block for solutions to a host of hard problems such as parallelism, recovery, transactional consistency, high availability, failover, and replication.},

	abstract     = {Mobile applications, such as those on WebOS, increasingly depend on continuous analytics results of real-time events, for monitoring oil &amp; gas production, watching traffic status and detecting accident, etc, which has given rise to the need of providing Continuous analytics as a Service (CaaaS). While representing a paradigm shift in cloud computing, CaaaS poses several challenges in scalability, latency, time-window semantics, transaction control and result-set staging.A data stream is infinite thus can only be analyzed in granules. We propose a continuous query model over both static relations and dynamic streaming data, which allows a long-standing SQL query instance to run cycle by cycle, each cycle for a chunk of data from the data stream, using a cut-and-rewind mechanism. We further support the cycle-based transaction model with cycle-based isolation and visibility, for delivering analytics results to the clients continuously while the query is running. To have the continuously generated analytics results staged efficiently, we developed the table-ring and label switching mechanism characterized by staging data through metadata manipulation without physical data moving and copying. To scale-out analytics computation, we support both parallel database based and network distributed Map-Reduce based infrastructure with multiple cooperating engines.We have built the proposed infrastructure by extending the PostgreSQL engine. We tested the throughput and latency of this service based on a well-known stream processing benchmark; the results show that the proposed approach is highly competitive. Our experiments indicate that the database technology can be extended and applied to real-time continuous analytics service provisioning.},

Oracle uses a time-based execution model while StreamBase uses a tuple-based execution model. Time-based execution provides a way to model simultaneity while tuple-based execution provides a way to react to primitive events as soon as they are seen by the system.The result is a new model that gives the user control over the granularity at which one can express simultaneity. Of course, it is possible to ignore simultaneity altogether. The proposed model captures ordering and simultaneity through partial orders on batches of tuples. The batching and the ordering are encapsulated in and can be modified by means of a powerful new operator that we call SPREAD. This paper describes the semantics of SPREAD and gives several examples of its use.},

	abstract     = {Real-time data analysis and management are increasingly critical for today's businesses. SQL is the de facto lingua franca for these endeavors, yet support for robust streaming analysis and management with SQL remains limited. Many approaches restrict semantics to a reduced subset of features and/or require a suite of non-standard constructs. Additionally, use of event timestamps to provide native support for analyzing events according to when they actually occurred is not pervasive, and often comes with important limitations. We present a three-part proposal for integrating robust streaming into SQL, namely: (1) time-varying relations as a foundation for classical tables as well as streaming data, (2) event time semantics, (3) a limited set of optional keyword extensions to control the materialization of time-varying query results. We show how with these minimal additions it is possible to utilize the complete suite of standard SQL semantics to perform robust stream processing. We motivate and illustrate these concepts using examples and describe lessons learned from implementations in Apache Calcite, Apache Flink, and Apache Beam. We conclude with syntax and semantics of a concrete proposal for extensions of the SQL standard and note further areas of exploration.},

Recently, ETL was replaced by the more comprehensive acronym, data integration (DI). DI describes the process of extracting and combining data from a variety of data source formats, transforming that data into a unified data model representation and loading it into a data store. This is done in the context of a variety of scenarios, such as data acquisition for business intelligence, analytics and data warehousing, but also synchronization of data between operational applications, data migrations and conversions, master data management, enterprise data sharing and delivery of data services in a service-oriented architecture context, amongst others. With these scenarios relying on up-to-date information it is critical to implement a highly performing, scalable and easy to maintain data integration system. This is especially important as the complexity, variety and volume of data is constantly increasing and performance of data integration systems is becoming very critical. Despite the significance of having a highly performing DI system, there has been no industry standard for measuring and comparing their performance. The TPC, acknowledging this void, has released TPC-DI, an innovative benchmark for data integration. This paper motivates the reasons behind its development, describes its main characteristics including workload, run rules, metric, and explains key decisions.},

	abstract     = {A recent trend in data stream processing shows the use of advanced continuous queries (CQs) that reference non-streaming resources such as relational data in databases and machine learning models. Since non-streaming resources could be shared among multiple systems, resources may be updated by the systems during the CQ-execution. As a consequence, CQs may reference resources inconsistently, and lead to a wide range of problems from inappropriate results to fatal system failures. We address this inconsistency problem by introducing the concept of transaction processing onto data stream processing. We introduce CQ-derived transaction, a concept that derives read-only transactions from CQs, and illustrate that the inconsistency problem is solved by ensuring serializability of derived transactions and resource updating transactions. To ensure serializability, we propose three CQ-processing strategies based on concurrency control techniques: two-phase lock strategy, snapshot strategy, and optimistic strategy. Experimental study shows our CQ-processing strategies guarantee proper results, and their performances are comparable to the performance of conventional strategy that could produce improper results.},

	abstract     = {A defining characteristic of continuous queries over on-line data streams, possibly bounded by sliding windows, is the potentially infinite and time-evolving nature of their inputs and outputs. New items continually arrive on the input streams and new results are continually produced. Additionally, inputs expire by falling out of range of their sliding windows and results expire when they cease to satisfy the query. This impacts continuous query processing in two ways. First, data stream systems allow tables to be queried alongside data streams, but in terms of query semantics, it is not clear how updates of tables are different from insertions and deletions caused by the movement of the sliding windows. Second, many interesting queries need to store state, which must be kept up-to-date as time goes on. Therefore, query processing efficiency depends highly on the amount of overhead involved in state maintenance.In this paper, we show that the above issues can be solved by understanding the update patterns of continuous queries and exploiting them during query processing. We propose a classification that defines four types of update characteristics. Using our classification, we present a definition of continuous query semantics that clearly states the role of relations. We then propose the notion of update-pattern-aware query processing, where physical implementations of query operators, including the data structures used for storing intermediate state, vary depending on the update patterns of their inputs and outputs. When tested on IP traffic logs, our update-pattern-aware query plans routinely outperform the existing techniques by an order of magnitude.},

	abstract     = {Data stream systems execute a dynamic workload of long-running and one-time queries, with the streaming inputs typically bounded by sliding windows. For efficiency, windows may be advanced periodically by replacing the oldest part of the window with a batch of new data. Existing work on stream processing assumes that a window cannot be advanced while it is being accessed by a query. In this paper, we argue that concurrent processing of queries (reads) and window-slides (writes) is required by data stream systems in order to allow prioritized query scheduling and improve the freshness of answers. We prove that the traditional notion of conflict serializability is insufficient in this context and define stronger isolation levels that restrict the allowed serialization orders. We also design and experimentally evaluate a transaction scheduler that efficiently enforces the new isolation levels.}

	abstract     = {We define a framework for static optimization of sliding window conjunctive queries over infinite streams. When computational resources are sufficient, we propose that the goal of optimization should be to find an execution plan that minimizes resource usage within the available resource constraints. When resources are insufficient, on the other hand, we propose that the goal should be to find an execution plan that sheds some of the input load (by randomly dropping tuples) to keep resource usage within bounds while maximizing the output rate. An intuitive approach to load shedding suggests starting with the plan that would be optimal if resources were sufficient and adding "drop boxes" to this plan. We find this to be often times suboptimal - in many instances the optimal partial answer plan results from adding drop boxes to plans that are not optimal in the unlimited resource case. In view of this, we use our framework to investigate an approach to optimization that unifies the placement of drop boxes and the choice of the query plan from which to drop tuples. The effectiveness of our optimizer is experimentally validated and the results show the promise of this approach.},

The main idea is to allow nonserializable schedules which preserve consistency and which are acceptable to the system users. To produce such schedules, the transaction processing mechanism receives semantic information from the users in the form of transaction semantic types, a division of transactions into steps, compatibility sets, and countersteps. Using these notions, we propose a mechanism which allows users to exploit their semantic knowledge in an organized fashion. The strengths and weaknesses of this approach are discussed.},

	abstract     = {Recent advances in stream processing technologies led to their adoption in many large companies, where they are becoming a core element in the data processing stack. In these settings, stream processors are often used in combination with various kinds of data management frameworks to build software architectures that combine data storage, processing, retrieval, and mining. However, the adoption of separate and heterogeneous subsystems makes these architectures overmuch complex, and this hinders the design, development, maintenance, and evolution of the overall system. We address this issue by proposing a new model that integrates data management within a distributed stream processor. The model enables individual stream processing operators to persist data and make it visible and queryable from external components. It offers flexible mechanisms to control the consistency of data, including transactional updates plus ordering and integrity constraints.The paper contributes to the research on stream processing in various ways: we introduce a new model that has the potential to simplify complex data-intensive applications by integrating data management capabilities within a stream processing system; we define data consistency guarantees and show how they are enforced within this new model; we implement the model into the FlowDB prototype, and study its overhead with respect to a pure stream processing system using real world case studies and synthetic workloads. Finally, we further prove the benefits of the proposed model by showing that FlowDB can outperform a state-of-the-art, in-memory distributed database in data management tasks.}

	abstract     = {Stream processing has been an active research field for more than 20 years, but it is now witnessing its prime time due to recent successful efforts by the research community and numerous worldwide open-source communities. The goal of this tutorial is threefold. First, we aim to review and highlight noteworthy past research findings, which were largely ignored until very recently. Second, we intend to underline the differences between early ('00-'10) and modern ('11-'18) streaming systems, and how those systems have evolved through the years. Most importantly, we wish to turn the attention of the database community to recent trends: streaming systems are no longer used only for classic stream processing workloads, namely window aggregates and joins. Instead, modern streaming systems are being increasingly used to deploy general event-driven applications in a scalable fashion, challenging the design decisions, architecture and intended use of existing stream processing systems.},

The information that is generated on social platforms like Twitter can produce rich data streams for immediate insights into ongoing matters and the conversations around them. To tackle the problem of event detection, we model events as a list of clusters of trending entities over time. We describe a real-time system for discovering events that is modular in design and novel in scale and speed: it applies clustering on a large stream with millions of entities per minute and produces a dynamically updated set of events. In order to assess clustering methodologies, we build an evaluation dataset derived from a snapshot of the full Twitter Firehose and propose novel metrics for measuring clustering quality. Through experiments and system profiling, we highlight key results from the offline and online pipelines. Finally, we visualize a high profile event on Twitter to show the importance of modeling the evolution of events, especially those detected from social data streams.},

	abstract     = {Stream processing addresses the needs of real-time applications. Transaction processing addresses the coordination and safety of short atomic computations. Heretofore, these two modes of operation existed in separate, stove-piped systems. In this work, we attempt to fuse the two computational paradigms in a single system called S-Store. In this way, S-Store can simultaneously accommodate OLTP and streaming applications. We present a simple transaction model for streams that integrates seamlessly with a traditional OLTP system, and provides both ACID and stream-oriented guarantees. We chose to build S-Store as an extension of H-Store - an open-source, in-memory, distributed OLTP database system. By implementing S-Store in this way, we can make use of the transaction processing facilities that H-Store already provides, and we can concentrate on the additional features that are needed to support streaming. Similar implementations could be done using other main-memory OLTP platforms. We show that we can actually achieve higher throughput for streaming workloads in S-Store than an equivalent deployment in H-Store alone. We also show how this can be achieved within H-Store with the addition of a modest amount of new functionality. Furthermore, we compare S-Store to two state-of-the-art streaming systems, Esper and Apache Storm, and show how S-Store can sometimes exceed their performance while at the same time providing stronger correctness guarantees.},

	abstract     = {Many stream processing applications require access to a multitude of streaming as well as stored data sources. Yet there is no clear semantics for correct continuous query execution over these data sources in the face of concurrent access and failures. Instead, today's Stream Processing Systems (SPSs) hard-code transactional concepts in their execution models, making them both hard to understand and inflexible to use. In this paper, we show that we can successfully reuse the traditional transactional theory (with some minimal extensions) in order to cleanly define the correct interaction of a set of continuous and one-time queries concurrently accessing both streaming and stored data sources. The result is a unified transactional model (UTM) for query processing over streams as well as traditional databases. We present a transaction manager that implements this model on top of an existing storage manager for streams (MXQuery/SMS). Experiments on the Linear Road Benchmark show that our transaction manager flexibly ensures correctness in case of concurrency and failures, without sacrificing from performance. Moreover, this model is powerful enough to express the implicit transactional behaviors of a representative set of state-of-the-art SPSs.},

	abstract     = {Stream processing has become an important research issue with the increase in stream data sources. Many stream processing systems need to reference non-streaming resources such as database relations to answer real world queries. Since database relation is a shared entity, it may be updated during the continuous query CQ execution by other database clients resulting in inconsistent query results partly using the relation before update and partly after update. For this problem, an isolation model is needed to define the way in which these updates are reflected in the output of the stream-relation join. In this work we propose an incremental CQ processing approach with isolation guarantees which makes use of a monitor operator to transform the relational updates into stream tuples. Since database relations tend to be large, an in-memory T*-Tree index is used to increase the stream-relation join efficiency. Experiments are performed to prove that guaranteeing isolation solves the inconsistency problem and to show that the incremental computation and indexing improves the query throughput significantly.},

Our new approach builds on two state of the art algorithms. The first algorithm is based on identifying bursty keywords inside blocks of blog messages. The second one involves clustering blog messages based on similarity of their contents. To combine the computational simplicity of the keyword-based algorithm with the semantic accuracy of the clustering-based algorithm, we propose a new hybrid algorithm. We then implement these algorithms in a streaming manner, on top of Apache Storm augmented with Apache Cassandra for state management. Experiments with a 12M tweet dataset from Twitter show that our hybrid approach provides a better accuracy-performance compromise than the previous approaches.}

In online convex programming, the convex set is known in advance, but in each step of some repeated optimization problem, one must select a point in F before seeing the cost function for that step. This can be used to model factory production, farm production, and many other industrial optimization problems where one is unaware of the value of the items produced until they have already been constructed. We introduce an algorithm for this domain. We also apply this algorithm to repeated games, and show that it is really a generalization of infinitesimal gradient ascent, and the results here imply that generalized infinitesimal gradient ascent (GIGA) is universally consistent.},

It can handily analyze massive document collections, including those arriving in a stream. We study the performance of online LDA in several ways, including by fitting a 100-topic topic model to 3.3M articles from Wikipedia in a single pass. We demonstrate that online LDA finds topic models as good or better than those found with batch VB, and in a fraction of the time.},

	abstract     = {Support transaction property and fault-tolerance is the key to applying stream processing to industry-scale applications; however the corresponding latency overhead must be minimized for accommodating real-time analytics. This issue has been studied in various contexts. In this work we develop the backtrackfailure recovery mechanism to allow a task to roll forward without waiting for acknowledgement from its downstream target tasks in the failure-free case, but to request its upstream source tasks to resend the missing tuples only during failure recovery which is the rare case thus has limited impact on the overall performance. For further reduced latency we extend our solution in another dimension by applying the notion of optimistic checkpointing to stream processing, and propose the Continued stream processing with Window-based Checkpoint and Recovery (CWCR) approach, allowing a task to emit results tuple by tuple continuously but checkpoint in batch, and acknowledge, only once per window (e.g. time window). We also tackle the hard problems found in implementing a transactional layer on-top of an existing stream processing platform. We have implemented the proposed mechanisms on Fontainebleau, the distributed stream analytics infrastructure we built on top of the open-sourced Storm platform. Our experiment results reveal the novelty of the proposed technologies and the feasibility to support fault-tolerance with minimal latency overhead for real-time stream processing.}

	abstract     = {Data Stream Management Systems (DSMS) operate under strict performance requirements. Key to meeting such requirements is to efficiently handle time-critical tasks such as managing internal states of continuous query operators, traffic on the queues between operators, as well as providing storage support for shared computation and archived data. In this paper, we introduce a general purpose storage management framework for DSMSs that performs these tasks based on a clean, loosely-coupled, and flexible system design that also facilitates performance optimization. An important contribution of the framework is that, in analogy to buffer management techniques in relational database systems, it uses information about the access patterns of streaming applications to tune and customize the performance of the storage manager. In the paper, we first analyze typical application requirements at different granularities in order to identify important tunable parameters and their corresponding values. Based on these parameters, we define a general-purpose storage management interface. Using the interface, a developer can use our SMS (Storage Manager for Streams) to generate a customized storage manager for streaming applications. We explore the performance and potential of SMS through a set of experiments using the Linear Road benchmark.},

	abstract     = {Today’s streaming applications demand increasingly high event throughput rates and are often subject to strict latency constraints. To allow for more complex workloads, such as window-based aggregations, streaming systems need to support stateful event processing. This introduces new challenges for streaming engines as the state needs to be maintained in a consistent and durable manner and simultaneously accessed by complex queries for real-time analytics.Modern streaming systems, such as Apache Flink, do not allow for efficiently exposing the state to analytical queries. Thus, data engineers are forced to keep the state in external data stores, which significantly increases the latencies until events become visible to analytical queries. Proprietary solutions have been created to meet data freshness constraints. These solutions are expensive, error-prone, and difficult to maintain. Main-memory database systems, such as HyPer, achieve extremely low query response times while maintaining high update rates, which makes them well-suited for analytical streaming workloads. In this article, we explore extensions to database systems to match the performance and usability of streaming systems.},

	abstract     = {Modern data-centric flows in the telecommunications industry require real time analytical processing over a rapidly changing and large dataset. The traditional approach of separating OLTP and OLAP workloads cannot satisfy this requirement. Instead, a new class of integrated solutions for handling hybrid workloads is needed. This paper presents an industrial use case and a novel architecture that integrates key-value-based event processing and SQL-based analytical processing on the same distributed store while minimizing the total cost of ownership. Our approach combines several well-known techniques such as shared scans, delta processing, a PAX-fashioned storage layout, and an interleaving of scanning and delta merging in a completely new way. Performance experiments show that our system scales out linearly with the number of servers. For instance, our system sustains event streams of 100,000 events per second while simultaneously processing 100 ad-hoc analytical queries per second, using a cluster of 12 commodity servers. In doing so, our system meets all response time goals of our telecommunication customers; that is, 10 milliseconds per event and 100 milliseconds for an ad-hoc analytical query. Moreover, our system beats commercial competitors by a factor of 2.5 in analytical and two orders of magnitude in update performance.},

Meanwhile, in the field of database systems, a new demand for HTAP (hybrid transactional and analytical processing) that integrates the functions of on-line transaction processing (OLTP) and on-line analytical processing (OLAP) is emerging. Based on this background, our group started a new project to develop data stream processing technologies in the HTAP environment in cooperation with other research groups in Japan. Our main focus is to develop new data stream processing methodologies such as fault tolerance in cooperation with the OLAP engine.

	abstract     = {This paper presents a novel research direction in the field of sensor data management. It concerns transactional support in heterogeneous large scale sensor systems. Besides well-known continuous queries on sensor data, system management queries should be supported in these systems. Indeed, with increasing capacity and diversity of sensors, new applications which require complex read-only and update queries are likely to appear. Those applications will require challenging properties such as ACID properties. This paper discusses the relevance of ACID properties in sensor data management context. It then focuses on the isolation property and proposes a concurrency control mechanism to support concurrent execution of continuous queries and update transactions on sensor properties.},
