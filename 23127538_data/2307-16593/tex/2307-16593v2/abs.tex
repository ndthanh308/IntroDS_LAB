We present a self-stabilizing algorithm for the (asynchronous) unison
problem which achieves an efficient trade-off between time, workload,
and space in a weak model.
%
Precisely, our algorithm is defined in the atomic-state model and
works in anonymous networks in which even local ports are unlabeled.
It makes no assumption on the daemon and thus stabilizes under the
weakest one: the distributed unfair daemon.

In a $n$-node network of
diameter $D$ and assuming a period $B \geq 2D+2$, our algorithm only
requires $O(\log B)$ bits per node to achieve full polynomiality as it
stabilizes in at most $2D-2$ rounds and $O(\min(n^2B, n^3))$ moves.
In particular and to the best of our knowledge, it is the first
self-stabilizing unison for arbitrary anonymous networks achieving an
asymptotically optimal stabilization time in rounds using a bounded
memory at each node.

Finally, we show that our solution allows to efficiently simulate
synchronous self-stabilizing algorithms in an asynchronous
environment.  This provides a new state-of-the-art algorithm solving
both the leader election and the spanning tree construction problem in
any identified connected network which, to the best of our knowledge,
beat all existing solutions of the literature.
