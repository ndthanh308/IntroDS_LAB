We added time window support to the state-of-the-art open-source implementation of HGS for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (HGS-CVRP) [10], and included additional construction heuristics, a Selective Route Exchange (SREX) [6] crossover and an intensified local search procedure inspired by the SWAP* neighborhood [11]. The code has been optimized and we used different schedules for growing the size of neighborhood and population based on instance characteristics. For the VRPTW with distance-only objective (not minimizing vehicles) we found several improvements of best known solutions (BKS) for Gehring \& Homberger [3] benchmark instances. The solver ranked 1st in Phase 1 of the VRPTW track of the 12th DIMACS implementation challenge.},

The obtained experimental results clearly show that the behavior and relative ranking of the operators within the vehicle routing environment is different than within the traveling salesman environment.},

  abstract = {The vehicle routing problem is one of the most studied combinatorial optimization topics, due to its practical importance and methodological interest. Yet, despite extensive methodological progress, many recent studies are hampered by the limited access to simple and efficient open-source solution methods. Given the sophistication of current algorithms, reimplementation is becoming a difficult and time-consuming exercise that requires extensive care for details to be truly successful. Against this background, we use the opportunity of this short paper to introduce a simple \textendash{} open-source \textendash{} implementation of the hybrid genetic search (HGS) specialized to the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). This state-of-the-art algorithm uses the same general methodology as Vidal et~al. (2012) but also includes additional methodological improvements and lessons learned over the past decade of research. In particular, it includes an additional neighborhood called SWAP* which consists in exchanging two customers between different routes without an insertion in place. As highlighted in our study, an efficient exploration of SWAP* moves significantly contributes to the performance of local searches. Moreover, as observed in experimental comparisons with other recent approaches on the classical instances of Uchoa et~al. (2017), HGS still stands as a leading metaheuristic regarding solution quality, convergence speed, and conceptual simplicity.},

  abstract = {The Split algorithm is an essential building block of route-first cluster-second heuristics and modern genetic algorithms for vehicle routing problems. The algorithm is used to partition a solution, represented as a giant tour without occurrences of the depot, into separate routes with minimum cost. As highlighted by the recent survey of [Prins, Lacomme and Prodhon, Transport Res. C (40), 179-200], no less than 70 recent articles use this technique. In the vehicle routing literature, Split is usually assimilated to the search for a shortest path in a directed acyclic graph \$\textbackslash mathcal\{G\}\$ and solved in \$O(nB)\$ using Bellman's algorithm, where \$n\$ is the number of delivery points and \$B\$ is the average number of feasible routes that start with a given customer in the giant tour. Some linear-time algorithms are also known for this problem as a consequence of a Monge property of \$\textbackslash mathcal\{G\}\$. In this article, we highlight a stronger property of this graph, leading to a simple alternative algorithm in \$O(n)\$. Experimentally, we observe that the approach is faster than the classical Split for problem instances of practical size. We also extend the method to deal with a limited fleet and soft capacity constraints.},

	abstract = {To develop a non-polluting and sustainable city, urban administrators encourage logistics companies to use electric vehicles instead of conventional (i.e., fuel-based) vehicles for transportation services. However, electric energy-based limitations pose a new challenge in designing reasonable visiting routes that are essential for the daily operations of companies. Therefore, this paper investigates a real-world electric vehicle routing problem ({VRP}) raised by a logistics company. The problem combines the features of the capacitated {VRP}, the {VRP} with time windows, the heterogeneous fleet {VRP}, the multi-trip {VRP}, and the electric {VRP} with charging stations. To solve such a complicated problem, a heuristic approach based on the adaptive large neighborhood search ({ALNS}) and integer programming is proposed in this paper. Specifically, a charging station adjustment heuristic and a departure time adjustment heuristic are devised to decrease the total operational cost. Furthermore, the best solution obtained by the {ALNS} is improved by integer programming. Twenty instances generated from real-world data were used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm. The results demonstrate that using our algorithm can save 7.52\% of operational cost.},

We introduce two enhancements for the exact solution of the VRPTW by branch-price-and-cut (BPC). First, we develop a sharper form of the limited-memory subset-row inequalities by representing the memory as an arc subset rather than a node subset. Second, from the elementary inequalities introduced by Balas in 1977, we derive a family of inequalities that dominate them. These enhancements are embedded into an exact BPC algorithm that includes state-of-the-art features such as bidirectional labeling, decremental state-space relaxation, completion bounds, variable fixing, and route enumeration. Computational results show that these enhancements are particularly effective for the most difficult instances and that our BPC algorithm can solve all 56 Solomon instances with 100 customers and 51 of 60 Gehring and Homberger instances with 200 customers.},

Recently, end-to-end deep learning methods have been proposed to learn approximate solution heuristics for such problems. In contrast, classical dynamic programming (DP) algorithms guarantee optimal solutions, but scale badly with the problem size. We propose Deep Policy Dynamic Programming (DPDP), which aims to combine the strengths of learned neural heuristics with those of DP algorithms. DPDP prioritizes and restricts the DP state space using a policy derived from a deep neural network, which is trained to predict edges from example solutions. We evaluate our framework on the travelling salesman problem (TSP), the vehicle routing problem (VRP) and TSP with time windows (TSPTW) and show that the neural policy improves the performance of (restricted) DP algorithms, making them competitive to strong alternatives such as LKH, while also outperforming most other 'neural approaches' for solving TSPs, VRPs and TSPTWs with 100 nodes.},

  abstract = {Vehicle routing attributes are extra characteristics and decisions that complement the academic problem formulations and aim to properly account for real-life application needs. Hundreds of methods have been introduced in recent years for specific attributes, but the development of a single, general-purpose algorithm, which is both efficient and applicable to a wide family of variants remains a considerable challenge. Yet, such a development is critical for understanding the proper impact of attributes on resolution approaches, and to answer the needs of actual applications. This paper contributes towards addressing these challenges with a component-based design for heuristics, targeting multi-attribute vehicle routing problems, and an efficient general-purpose solver. The proposed Unified Hybrid Genetic Search metaheuristic relies on problem-independent unified local search, genetic operators, and advanced diversity management methods. Problem specifics are confined to a limited part of the method and are addressed by means of assignment, sequencing, and route-evaluation components, which are automatically selected and adapted and provide the fundamental operators to manage attribute specificities. Extensive computational experiments on 29 prominent vehicle routing variants, 42 benchmark instance sets and overall 1099 instances, demonstrate the remarkable performance of the method which matches or outperforms the current state-of-the-art problem-tailored algorithms. Thus, generality does not necessarily go against efficiency for these problem classes.},

In this study, we investigate the use of predictions from graph neural networks (GNNs) in the form of heatmaps to improve the Hybrid Genetic Search (HGS), a state-of-the-art algorithm for the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The crossover and local-search components of HGS are instrumental in finding improved solutions, yet these components essentially rely on simple greedy or random choices. It seems intuitive to attempt to incorporate additional knowledge at these levels. Throughout a vast experimental campaign on more than 10,000 problem instances, we show that exploiting more sophisticated strategies using measures of node relatedness (heatmaps, or simply distance) within these algorithmic components can significantly enhance performance. However, contrary to initial expectations, we also observed that heatmaps did not present significant advantages over simpler distance measures for these purposes. Therefore, we faced a common \textemdash though rarely documented\textemdash{} situation of overkill: GNNs can indeed improve performance on an important optimization task, but an ablation analysis demonstrated that simpler alternatives perform equally well.},
