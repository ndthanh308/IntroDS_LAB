\begin{abstract}
{
We performed a systematic first-principles study on vibrationally-resolved X-ray absorption (XAS) and photoelectron (XPS) spectra of a series of diatomic molecules and cations (XAS, N$_2$, N$_2^+$, NO$^+$, CO, CO$^+$; XPS, CO) at the C/N/O K-edges. All computations were done in a time-independent (TI) framework under the harmonic oscillator approximation. To evaluate the performance of different functionals, two common pure (BLYP and BP86) and two hybrid (B3LYP and M06-2X) functionals were used. Excellent agreement between theoretical and experimental spectra was observed in most systems.  Two instances, where the peak separations were underestimated, were seen in the O1s XAS spectra of CO and NO$^+$, and we explain this discrepancy to the anharmonic effects. The functional dependence can be evident or negligible, depending on the specific system and spectrum under consideration. In all these examples, the pure functionals exhibit a better or similar spectral accuracy to the hybrid functionals. This was attributed to better accuracy in bond lengths and vibrational frequencies (in both the initial and final states) predicted by pure functionals, as compared with the experiments.  Structural and frequency changes induced by the core hole were summarized. We highlight the use of density functional theory with pure functionals for such diatomic calculations for easy execution and generally reliable accuracy.

\section{Introduction}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Spectroscopy links experiment and theory, with precision at the heart. An illustrative example in the history of physics is the hydrogen spectrum, where escalating measurement precision has reciprocally fostered the evolution of quantum theory. High-resolution spectroscopy acts as a litmus test for gauging the precision of theoretical methods used. Particularly, in the context of high-resolution vibrationally-resolved X-ray spectroscopy,\cite{carravetta_x-ray_2022, hergenhahn_vibrational_2004, svensson_soft_2005, book_ESCA_molecules, gelmukhanov_theory_1977, chen_k_1989, rennie_comprehensive_2000,minkov_naphthalene_2004,fronzoni_vibrationally_2014,mosnier_inner-shell_2016, vaz_da_cruz_anomalous_2018,  michelitsch_efficient_2019, Thesis_Kjellsson_2021,huang_theoretical_2022, schippers_vibrationally_2023} comparison to experimental data affords an evaluation of the quality of potential energy surfaces (PESs) for both the core-electron excited (or ionized) and the ground electronic states. It also provides opportunities to scrutinize the accuracy of employed electronic structure methods, especially when dealing with states that encompass a core hole.

Density functional theory (DFT) has emerged as a predominant electronic structure method, offering profound insights into a broad spectrum of molecules and materials. It holds the capability to accurately predict X-ray spectra.\cite{besley_density_2020} The conjunction of DFT with the Duschinsky rotation (DR) method\cite{duschinsky_interpretation_1937} has yielded substantial alignment with experiments for vibrationally-resolved X-ray photoelectron (XPS)\cite{hua_theoretical_2020, wei_vibronic_2022, cheng_vibrationally-resolved_2022} and absorption (XAS)\cite{couto_breaking_2021} spectra, spanning a comprehensive spectrum of molecules, such as benzene,\cite{hua_theoretical_2020} furan,\cite{hua_theoretical_2020} pyridine,\cite{hua_theoretical_2020} azines,\cite{wei_vibronic_2022} polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),\cite{cheng_vibrationally-resolved_2022} and ions like N$_2$H$^+$.\cite{couto_breaking_2021}   In these calculations, either full core-hole (FCH) or excited core-hole (XCH)\cite{prendergast_x-ray_2006} approximation was leveraged to describe the core ionized (in the case of XAS) or excited (in the case of XPS) states, while conventional DFT was employed to model the ground state (GS). (In the subsequent context, the term ``excited state'' is used without distinction to refer to either a core excited or ionized state.) It is worth noting of other DFT applications\cite{minkov_naphthalene_2004, minkov_biphenyl_2005, hua_theoretical_2020} also with the half core hole (HCH)\cite{triguero_calculations_1998} or the equivalent core hole (ECH, i.e., Z+1)\cite{jolly_thermodynamic_1970} approximations. Buoyed by the promising outcomes from DFT computations, we are currently engaged in formulating a theoretical library for vibrationally-resolved XPS/XAS spectra of common molecules and ions, with initial findings already disseminated.\cite{hua_theoretical_2020, wei_vibronic_2022, cheng_vibrationally-resolved_2022} Most investigated systems were polyatomic, i.e., composed of three or more atoms. 

A diatomic system, with a single vibrational mode, offers a more ``transparent'' view of vibronic coupling effects and is highly sensitive to the utilized electronic structure method. Diatomic molecules such as N$_2$,\cite{ehara_symmetry-dependent_2006} CO,\cite{puttner_vibrationally_1999} NO,\cite{puttner_vibrationally_1999} and ions like NH$^+$,\cite{carniato_vibrationally_2020} N$_2$$^+$,\cite{lindblad_x-ray_2020} CO$^+$,\cite{couto_carbon_2020}  NO$^+$,\cite{lindblad_experimental_2022} 
and C$_2^-$\cite{schippers_vibrationally_2023}
have been extensively investigated through both XPS/XAS experiments\cite{ehara_symmetry-dependent_2006, puttner_vibrationally_1999, hergenhahn_vibrational_2004, carniato_vibrationally_2020, lindblad_x-ray_2020, couto_carbon_2020, lindblad_experimental_2022, schippers_vibrationally_2023} and simulations at varied levels.\cite{carravetta_x-ray_2022, ehara_symmetry-dependent_2006, puttner_vibrationally_1999, carniato_vibrationally_2020, lindblad_x-ray_2020, couto_carbon_2020, lindblad_experimental_2022, schippers_vibrationally_2023} Generally, the results indicate good agreement. Alongside technological advancements in X-ray synchrotron beams for experimental development\cite{mosnier_inner-shell_2016}, theoretical methods for X-ray spectra have also seen significant improvements in recent years\cite{carravetta_x-ray_2022}, enabling high-quality theoretical predictions of vibrationally resolved X-ray spectra. Neutral diatomic molecules have been a frequent focus in many X-ray spectral studies due to their ability to reach higher target densities compared to charged particles\cite{schippers_vibrationally_2023}. Recent innovations in ion beam and ion trap techniques have facilitated precise inner-shell investigations involving positively charged diatomic molecular ions.\cite{lindblad_experimental_2022, carniato_vibrationally_2020}

We found that various post-Hartree-Fock methods were used in almost all calculations.  Couto et al.\cite{couto_carbon_2020} presented and analyzed high-resolution XAS spectra of CO$^+$, using wavepacket dynamics calculations based on potential energy curves (PECs) computed with the restricted active space second-order perturbation (RASPT2) method. Using the restricted active space multiconfigurational theory self-consistent field (RASSCF) and second-order perturbation (RASPT2) methods, Lindblad et al. interpreted the experimental XAS spectra of N$_2^+$\cite{lindblad_x-ray_2020} and NO$^+$.\cite{lindblad_experimental_2022} Carniato et al.\cite{carniato_vibrationally_2020} simulated the PECs of low-lying N1s excited states of NH$^+$ by using the configuration interaction singles and doubles (CISD) method and the valence-state PECs by multiconfigurational self-consistent field (MCSCF). Rocha\cite{rocha_potential_2011} simulated PEC of CO in the lowest C1s excited state by the restricted active space SCF (RASSCF) method, termed also as the inner-shell complete active space SCF (IS-CASSCF) method. Martins et al.\cite{martins_disentangling_2021} computed PECs of low-lying F1s core excited states of HF and HF$^+$ by using the full configuration-interaction method to help understand the photodissociation dynamics. Such studies have been instrumental in enriching our understanding of core-hole state electronic structure, X-ray physics, vibronic coupling, and bond dissociation dynamics. However, such studies typically cover one or only a few systems. Computational studies by different groups frequently take different theoretical levels. There is a lack of simulations of many systems on the same footing, which is essential for enabling fair comparisons and analyses to draw general rules concerning vibronic coupling properties.

The aim of this study is to benchmark the application of DFT in simulating vibrationally-resolved XPS/XAS spectra of diatomic systems. This premise is built upon the ability of DFT to generate accurate potential energy curves (PECs) in close proximity to the Franck-Condon region, despite its potential shortcomings at larger bond distances where multi-configurational effects become pivotal.  In this work, the FCH approximation will be deployed for the 1s ionized state and the XCH approximation for the lowest 1s excited state. A variety of common molecules and ions will be used for the XAS (N$_2$, N$_2^+$, NO$^+$, CO, and CO$^+$) and XPS (CO) spectra, covering the C/N/O K-edges.

Generally, two complementary solutions to vibronic coupling include the time-independent (TI) and time-dependent (TD) frameworks. The TI method is usually based on the harmonic oscillator approximation and mathematically represented by an analytical sum-over-states expression.\cite{cerezo_fcclasses3_2023} It involves optimizing the structure of the final state and performing vibrational frequency calculations, which can be challenging for certain systems.\cite{wei_vibronic_2022, wei_vibronic_2023} However, the spectral interpretations obtained through the TI approach are direct and straightforward. On the other hand, the TD wavepacket method is based on the Fourier transform of the auto-correlation function.\cite{gelmukhanov_resonant_1999, couto_carbon_2020} This method allows for the inclusion of anharmonic effects that can be included from the input potential energy surfaces. In this study, we specifically present the results obtained using the TI framework. We plan to utilize the TD method in a subsequent study (paper II) \cite{zhanglu2} in order to get a complete picture.

\section{Time-independent method}  \label{sec:method}
%\zhanglu{Method}
% \section{Methodology}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We use bolded symbols in lower and upper cases for vectors and matrices, respectively, while symbols in normal fonts indicate scalars. The initial (ground) electronic state is denoted by  $g$, and the final (core-excited or core-ionized) electronic state by $e$. We differentiate any physical quantity in state $g$  or  $e$ using a respective symbol with or without a prime. As such, equilibrium geometries (expressed as Cartesian coordinates in column vectors) of the initial and final states are denoted by $\mathbf{x}'$ and $\mathbf{x}$; normal coordinates (also in column vectors) for both states are represented by  $\mathbf{q}'$ and  $\mathbf{q}$; respective normal mode matrices are signified by $\mathbf{L}'$ and  $\mathbf{L}$; vibrational frequencies are designated by $\omega'$ and  $\omega$; and bond lengths are represented by $R'$ and $R$.

The time-independent method was considered based on the harmonic oscillator approximation. Vibrational frequency calculations were first performed at the optimized geometries of both the initial and the final electronic states. The Duschinsky rotation (DR) method\cite{duschinsky_interpretation_1937} was then used to connect both normal coordinates:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{q}'=\mathbf{J} \mathbf{q} + \mathbf{k}.\label{eq:dus}  
\end{equation}
Here $\mathbf{k}$ indicates the displacement vector between the PESs of both electronic states along the normal coordinate. $\mathbf{J}$ is the Duschinsky rotation matrix, which is 1 for a diatomic system. $\mathbf{k}$ depends on the initial-state normal coordinate matrix $\mathbf{L}'$, the diagonal matrix of atomic masses $\mathbf{M}$, and the change between the equilibrium geometries of both states $\Delta \mathbf{x}$ ($\Delta \mathbf{x} \equiv \mathbf{x}-\mathbf{x}'$):
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{k} = (\mathbf{L}')^T\mathbf{M}^{1/2}\Delta \mathbf{x}.
\end{equation}  The vibrational profile can then be calculated with $\mathbf{k}$ and the vibrational frequencies ($\omega'$ and $\omega$).\cite{sharp_franckcondon_1964, ruhoff_recursion_1994, ruhoff_algorithms_2000} 

The 0-0 vibrational transition energy in XAS and XPS spectra are respectively calculated by using the $\Delta$Kohn-Sham ($\Delta$KS)  scheme,\cite{PhysRev.139.A619, triguero_separate_1999}
 \begin{eqnarray}
E_{00}^{\rm{XAS}} &=& \it E_{\rm{XCH}}|_{\mathbf{min\ XCH}} - E_{\rm{GS}}|_{\mathbf{min\ GS}} + \delta_{\rm{rel}},\\
E_{00}^{\rm{XPS}} &=& \it E_{\rm{FCH}}|_{\mathbf{min\ FCH}} - E_{\rm{GS}}|_{\mathbf{min\ GS}} + \delta_{\rm{rel}},
 \end{eqnarray}
 which considers both electronic and geometrical relaxations. Here $E_{\rm{GS}}$, $E_{\rm{FCH}}$, and $E_{\rm{XCH}}$  stand for total energies of the ground electronic state, the  FCH state with one 1s electron removed, and the XCH state with one 1s electron excited to the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), respectively; $\mathbf{min\ GS}$, $\mathbf{min\ FCH}$, or $\mathbf{min\ XCH}$ denotes the optimized structure of each state. $\delta_{\rm{rel}}$ is a small uniform shift considering the differential relativistic effect, which is related to the removal of an electron from the core orbital. The values used for the C, N, and O 1s core holes are $\delta_{\rm{rel}}=$ 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 eV, respectively.\cite{triguero_separate_1999} 


%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 \section{Computational details} \label{sec:details}
%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
All time-independent calculations were carried out at the DFT level by using the GAMESS-US package.\cite{gordon_advances_2005, schmidt_general_1993} Four different functionals were chosen: BLYP,\cite{becke_density-functional_1988, lee_development_1988} BP86,\cite{becke_density-functional_1988, perdew_density-functional_1986} B3LYP,\cite{becke_densityfunctional_1993, lee_development_1988} and M06-2X.\cite{zhao_m06_2008} The aug-cc-pVTZ basis set\cite{dunning_gaussian_1989, kendall_electron_1992} was used in the optimization of the ground state. In the excited state,  the IGLO-III basis set\cite{diehl_iglo-method_1990} was set for the excited atom. For systems that  include two atoms of the same element (N$_2$ and N$_2^+$), model core potential (MCP) together with corresponding MCP/TZP basis set\cite{sakai_model_1997, noro_contracted_1997, bsjp} was employed for the non-excited atom.

All simulations were performed by enforcing the $C$$_4$$_v$ point group symmetry. Cartesian coordinates of all optimized geometries are provided in the Supplementary Material.\cite{si_zhanglu1}

After performing geometrical optimizations and vibrational frequency calculations for both the ground and excited states, a modified DynaVib package \cite{hua_theoretical_2020} was employed to compute the Franck-Condon factors (FCFs). The vibrationally-resolved XAS and XPS spectra were obtained by convoluting the stick FCFs with a Lorentzian function. A hwhm value, $\gamma$=0.05 eV, was chosen to achieve better agreement with experimental observations. Here $\gamma$ is to phenomenologically include many effects for broadening (such as the lifetime and instrumental broadening, environmental effects) and similar values have been utilized in previous studies for other systems.\cite{hua_theoretical_2020, wei_vibronic_2022, wei_vibronic_2023, cheng_vibrationally-resolved_2022} In practice, one may use the Voigt convolution (see, e.g., Ref. \cite{couto_breaking_2021}) to tune a better agreement with the experiment, with the Lorentzian/Gaussian hwhm values read a library,\cite{zschornack_handbook_2007} or directly from the experiment.\cite{couto_breaking_2021} However, in this work, the hwhm parameter is not considered as a pivotal factor. For simplicity and consistency, a constant hwhm value was utilized in all calculations, which does not impact the validity of our discussions.

%---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection{Bond lengths and core-hole induced changes}
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 
Table \ref{tab:bond}  shows the bond lengths in both the ground ($R'$) and excited ($R$) states of 10 examples located by four different functionals, as well as their differences, $\Delta R \equiv R-R'$. To more vividly show the comparisons with the gas phase experiments,  this information is visualized in Fig. \ref{fig:table1}.  The experimental bond lengths in the gas phase show a narrow region of $R'=$1.063--1.128 {\AA}, spanning over 0.065 \AA.  The 1s core excitation/ionization can either increase (by 0.025--0.163 \AA) or decrease (by 0.037--0.065 \AA) the bond lengths, depending on the system and the excited atom. This corresponds to positive or negative $\Delta R$ [see also Fig. \ref{fig:table1}(b)]. In the excited state, the bond lengths span a much wider range of 0.228 {\AA} ($R=$1.063--1.291 {\AA}). 

In general, our theoretical results by all functionals match well with the experiments [Table \ref{tab:bond}; Fig. \ref{fig:table1}(a)]. The mean absolute deviations (MADs) predicted by BLYP, BP86, B3LYP, and M06-2X functionals for $R$ ($R'$) are 0.008, 0.006, 0.008, 0.014  (0.008, 0.008, 0.005, 0.010) {\AA}, respectively. The maximum absolute deviations (MAXs) are 0.017, 0.017, 0.027, 0.037  (0.010, 0.010, 0.011, 0.017) {\AA}.  The relative errors for $R$ ($R'$) are 0.2\%--1.6\%, 0.0\%--1.6\%, 0.1\%--2.3\%, 0.2\%--3.4\% (0.0\%--0.9\%, 0.1\%--0.9\%, 0.2\%--1.0\%, 0.5\%--1.5\%).  Correspondingly for $\Delta R$, the deviations are 0.001--0.008, 0.000--0.007, 0.001--0.020, 0.001--0.022 {\AA}. 


The deviations from the experiments look almost invisible for $R$ or $R'$ [Fig. \ref{fig:table1}(a)] and small for $\Delta R$  [Fig. \ref{fig:table1}(b)]. Our results show that the pure functionals BLYP and BP86 (very close) generally provide an even better agreement with the experiments than the two hybrid functionals B3LYP and M06-2X. Specifically, with the two pure functionals, the best agreement with the experiments locates in N$_2^+$, with absolute deviations of only 0.000-0.002 {\AA} to the corresponding experiment.\cite{lindblad_x-ray_2020} The second best is N$_2$, with absolute deviations of only 0.000-0.005 {\AA} to the experiments.\cite{neeb_coherent_1994} The corresponding changes in bond length  $\Delta R$ for N$_2^+$ and N$_2$ are 0.038--0.038 and 0.061-0.063 {\AA}, respectively.  Meanwhile, B3LYP and M06-2X predict the worst agreement in $\Delta R$ for  N$_2^+$ and N$_2$  among all examples [Fig. \ref{fig:table1}(b)]: the  deviations by B3LYP are 0.014 and 0.020 {\AA}, and those by M06-2X are 0.021 and 0.022 {\AA}.



%To validate the accuracy of our theoretical methods, the computed bond lengths ($R'$ and $R$) and vibrational frequencies ($\omega'$ and $\omega$) by different functionals are listed in Tables \ref{tab:bond}  and  \ref{tab:frequency}, respectively, where comparisons are also made with experiments. These values are visualized in Fig. \ref{fig:table1} a,c; and in addition, the  changes in bond lengths ($\Delta R$) and vibrational frequencies ($\Delta \omega$) are shown respectively in Fig. \ref{fig:table1} b,d.

%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{Vibrational frequencies and core-hole induced changes}\label{sec:omega}
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ 

Table \ref{tab:frequency} lists the vibrational frequencies in both the initial ($\omega'$) and final ($\omega$) states with comparisons to experiments. The experimental vibrational frequencies cover a range of 2169.8--2376.7 cm$^{-1}$ (206.9 cm$^{-1}$) in the ground state geometry and a much wider range of 1338.9--2507.6 cm$^{-1}$ (1168.7 cm$^{-1}$) in the excited state one. The values are typical frequencies for stretching vibrational modes. Similarly to the bond lengths, the influence of the core hole has no definite change directions, that is, both frequency increase and decrease are found. 

The deviations of our DFT calculations to experiments seem to be larger than the bond lengths. This is because the vibrational frequency corresponds to the second-order energy derivatives of the Cartesian coordinates. BLYP, BP86, B3LYP, and M06-2X had MAD values of 38.5, 33.8, 111.7, 200.7 (44.2, 34.5, 73.3, 156.0) {cm$^{-1}$} for $\omega$ ($\omega'$), and MAX values are 74.1, 73.0, 315.0, 475.4 (55.3, 48.8, 122.8, 210.9) {cm$^{-1}$}.  The relative deviations for $\omega$ ($\omega'$) are 0.9\%--5.5\%, 0.1\%--3.7\%, 0.4\%--13.0\%, 2.3\%--20.0\% (1.0\%--2.6\%, 0.6\%--2.3\%, 1.9\%--5.6\%, 4.8\%--9.1\%). Additionally, Table \ref{tab:frequency} also shows the vibrational frequency change in the initial and final states, $\Delta\omega \equiv   \omega - \omega'$. Correspondingly, the deviations are 3.5--82.0, 2.0--96.2, 11.4--192.2, 12.5--275.7 {cm$^{-1}$}.

The deviations for $\omega'$ or $\omega$ are small for the pure functionals and acceptable for the hybrid functionals [Fig. \ref{fig:table1}(c)].  Concerning  $\Delta\omega$, the deviations by  BLYP or BP86  are small, while the results by B3LYP or M06-2X are acceptable for most examples [Fig. \ref{fig:table1}(d)]. Specifically, the largest deviation happens in N$_2^+$, which is 192.2 {cm$^{-1}$} by B3LYP and 275.7 {cm$^{-1}$} by M06-2X, respectively. 


The analysis of vibrational frequencies supports the same conclusion as the bond lengths that pure functionals produce better results than hybrid functionals. Our accuracy in vibrational frequencies is reasonable considering the absolute values of experimental frequencies are some 2100-2400 cm$^{-1}$ in the ground state and 1300-2500 cm$^{-1}$ in the excited state. Besides, our DFT calculations predicted balanced accuracy in both the ground and excited states, since the MADs (of the same functional) are close. Similar accuracy was obtained in other calculations. For instance, Moitra et al.\cite{moitra_vibrationally_2020} achieved an overestimation of 90 cm$^{-1}$  (2233 \textit{versus} 2143 cm$^{-1}$) and 102 cm$^{-1}$  (2432 \textit{versus} 2330 cm$^{-1}$) for CO and N$_2$, respectively, in the ground state by using the MP2 method.

\subsection{XAS of N$_2$ and N$_2^+$}
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Figures \ref{fig:xas:n2}-\ref{fig:xas:co+} display the simulated vibrationally-resolved XAS spectra of N$_2$, N$_2^+$, NO$^+$, CO, and CO$^+$, respectively, computed by  DFT with four different functionals. For each molecule, the spectra computed by the four functionals show evident differences. That is, the fine structures are sensitive to the choice of functionals for these diatomic systems. It is worth noting that weak functional dependence was observed in the vibrationally-resolved N1s XPS spectrum of pyrimidine (C$_4$H$_4$N$_2$).\cite{wei_vibronic_2022}  It appears that the functional sensitivity is washed away by multiple vibrational modes.  In most case studies, theoretical results agree well with corresponding experiments. 

Figure \ref{fig:xas:n2} displays our computed N1s XAS of N$_2$ and N$_2^+$ in comparison with the experiments.\cite{chen_k_1989, hitchcock_k-shell_1980, lindblad_x-ray_2020} In Fig. \ref{fig:xas:n2}(a), the experimental spectrum has 5 clear vibronic features, where the 0-0 and 0-1 peaks have almost equal intensities. Our BLYP and BP86 calculations predicted both accurate peak separations (i.e., to the vibrational frequencies) and relative peak intensities. As we know, in a diatomic system, the peak separation is equivalent to the vibrational frequency, and the agreement in separation here is consistent with the discussion above in Section \ref{sec:omega} (see also Table \ref{tab:frequency}). BLYP gives almost identical intensities of the 0-0 and 0-1 peaks, exhibiting the best agreement with the experiment. BP86 shows a slightly weaker 0-1 peak than the 0-0 peak. B3LYP and M06-2X predicted relatively large peak separations. The predicted 0-1 peak intensity is about 2/3 of the 0-0 peak. Our results show a better performance of the pure than hybrid functionals.

In Fig. \ref{fig:xas:n2}(b), the 0-0 experiment peak of  N$_2^+$ (394.29 eV) exhibits a redshift of 7.20 eV compared with N$_2$ (401.49 eV), in line with the valence shell ionization.  Besides, in the experimental spectrum, three vibronic features are evident, with the 0-1 peak having almost half the intensity compared to the 0-0 peak. Similarly, BLYP and BP86 predicted peak separations in good agreement with the experiment, and they reproduced the relative peak intensities with a slight underestimation of the 0-1 peak intensities. B3LYP and M06-2X slightly overestimated the peak separations. They also overestimated the 0-1 peak intensity compared with the 0-0 one, showing a slower decay in intensity than the experiment with respect to the increasing vibrational quantum number $n$.

%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{XAS of NO$^+$}
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Figure \ref{fig:xas:no} displays the XAS results of NO$^+$ in both the N1s and O1s edges. In the N1s edge (panel a), all functionals show good agreement with the experiment.\cite{lindblad_experimental_2022} The experiment spectrum distinguished five vibronic features with the 0-0 and 0-1 peaks having almost equal intensities. The pure functionals predicted good agreement in peak separations, while they slightly underestimate the 0-1 intensities and show a quicker decay with $n$. Meanwhile, B3LYP and M06-2X slightly overestimated the peak separations, and the peak intensities agree well with the experiment (almost equal 0-0 and 0-1 intensities).

In the O1s edge (panel b), the experiment spectrum\cite{lindblad_experimental_2022} shows more complex structures with 10 relatively weak vibronic features. To some extent, it also seems difficult to unambiguously distinguish the 0-0 peak. All four functionals predicted similar theoretical spectra. They give only acceptable agreement with the experiment: the general peak profile shapes are similar but the theory underestimated the peak separations. 

This seems to be a difficult case for theoretical simulations. We think the major reason cannot be assigned to the electronic structure method used as the performance of different functionals is similar. We ascribe the reason to the harmonic oscillator approximation used. This is consistent with the fact that O1s core excitation in NO$^+$ induced a large change in the potential energy surface, both in the equilibrium position and the curvature. The bond length was changed by +0.140 {\AA} (from 1.063 to 1.203 \AA) and the vibrational frequency was changed by -841.8 cm$^{-1}$ (from 2376.7 to 1534.9 cm$^{-1}$). They correspond respectively to the second largest (Table \ref{tab:bond}) and the largest (Table \ref{tab:frequency}) changes among all examples. More accurate calculations are expected by considering anharmonic effects.

\subsection{XAS of CO and CO$^+$}
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
CO and NO$^+$ are isoelectronic species. The results of CO show very similar performance to NO$^+$. As shown in Fig. \ref{fig:xas:co},  in the C1s edge, the experimental spectrum resolved only two simple features while in the O1s edge, it generates about 12 weak features in a broad peak. All functionals generated spectra with less functional dependence. They all predict good agreement to the experiment in the C1s edge and acceptable agreement in the O1s edge. All theories underestimate the peak separations in the O1s edge, similar to the case of NO$^+$ in the O1s edge. The underlying structural reason is also the drastic changes in the PEC as induced by the O1s core excitation. The change in bond length is +0.163 {\AA} (from 1.128 to 1.291 \AA) and that in vibrational frequency is -830.9 cm$^{-1}$ (from 2169.8 to 1338.9 cm$^{-1}$), which are the largest (Table \ref{tab:bond}) and the second largest (Table \ref{tab:frequency}) among all examples. 

The case of CO$^+$ is much simpler. Figure \ref{fig:xas:co+}  displays the XAS spectra of CO$^+$ in both the C1s and O1s edges. The valence-shell ionization (from CO to CO$^+$) leads to a red shift of the experimental 0-0 peak in both edges: -5.25 eV (from 287.29 to 282.04 eV) in the C1s edge and  -5.20 eV (from 533.62 to 528.42 eV) in the O1s edge. In both edges, the experimental spectra\cite{couto_carbon_2020} resolved three vibronic fine structures. All functionals produce a good agreement with the experiments both in energies and profiles, showing only weak functional dependence. 

%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
\subsection{XPS of CO}
%+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
All examples above are on XAS spectra. Figure \ref{fig:xps:co} displays the simulated vibrationally-resolved XPS spectra of CO at the C and O 1s edges. In comparison to the XAS experiments, the 0-0 peak in both edges exhibits blue shifts: +8.84 eV (from 287.29 to 296.13 eV)  and +9.00 eV (from 533.62 to 542.62 eV), respectively. The experimental XPS spectra\cite{hergenhahn_vibrational_2004} show simple vibronic features at both edges, and all theory well reproduced the experimental spectra. Specifically, the hybrid functional M06-2X seems to slightly overestimate the 0-1 peak intensity in the C1s edge [Fig. \ref{fig:xps:co}(a)]. By comparing the XAS [Fig. \ref{fig:xas:co}(b)] and XPS [Fig. \ref{fig:xps:co}(b)] spectra of CO at the O1s edge, one can find the different responses of the final-state PES induced by O1s excitation and ionization. This may be related to the odd or even number of electrons.

\section{Summary and Conclusions}
%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To summarize, in the time-independent framework with the harmonic oscillator approximation, we have systematically assessed the vibrationally-resolved XAS (N$_2$, N$_2^+$, NO$^+$, CO, CO$^+$) and XPS (CO) spectra of a series of diatomic systems by DFT with four different functionals. In most cases, the theoretical X-ray spectra match well with the experiments both in absolute energies and profiles. For two exceptions (O1s XAS of NO$^+$ and CO), theory predicted similar but shrunk profiles (i.e., the peak separations were underestimated) which were attributed to the strong anharmonic effects. With geometries of the 1s excited/ionized states located, bond lengths and vibrational frequencies were compared with the initial states to see the core hole effects. Comparisons with experiments show good agreement, and the pure functionals (BLYP and BP86) generally predicted better or similar agreement than the two hybrid functionals (B3LYP and M06-2X). The sensitivity of different functional depends on systems: evident dependence was observed in XAS spectra of N$_2$, N$_2^+$, and NO$^+$, while weak dependence was also found in the rest cases. Our study provides a systematic assessment of the DFT method in simulating vibrationally-resolved XAS/XPS spectra in the TI framework with the harmonic oscillator approximation.  We shall analyze in detail the anharmonic effects in the time-dependent framework in a subsequent study.\cite{zhanglu2}
