  "abstract": "Suppose $Ω$ is a closed bounded subset of ${\\mathbb R}^n,$ $S$ is an $n$-dimensional non-degenerate simplex, $ξ(Ω;S):=\\min \\left\\{σ\\geq 1: \\, Ω\\subset σS\\right\\}$. Here $σS$ is the result of homothety of $S$ with respect to the center of gravity with coefficient $σ$. Let $d\\geq n+1,$ $\\varphi_1(x),\\ldots,\\varphi_d(x)$ be linearly independent monomials in $n$ variables, $\\varphi_1(x)\\equiv 1,$ $\\varphi_2(x)=x_1,\\ \\ldots, \\ \\varphi_{n+1}(x)=x_n.$ Put $Π:={\\rm lin}(\\varphi_1,\\ldots,\\varphi_d).$ The interpolation projector $P: C(Ω)\\to Π$ with a set of nodes $x^{(1)},\\ldots, x^{(d)}$ $ \\in Ω$ is defined by equalities $Pf\\left(x^{(j)}\\right)=f\\left(x^{(j)}\\right).$ Denote by $\\|P\\|_Ω$ the norm of $P$ as an operator from $C(Ω)$ to $C(Ω)$. Consider the mapping $T:{\\mathbb R}^n\\to {\\mathbb R}^{d-1}$ of the form $T(x):=(\\varphi_2(x),\\ldots,\\varphi_d(x)). $ We have the following inequalities: $ \\frac{1}{2}\\left(1+\\frac{1}{d-1}\\right)\\left(\\|P\\|_Ω-1\\right)+1$ $ \\leq ξ(T(Ω);S)\\leq \\frac{d}{2}\\left(\\|P\\|_Ω-1\\right)+1. $ Here $S$ is the $(d-1)$-dimensional simplex with vertices $T\\left(x^{(j)}\\right).$ We discuss this and other relations for polynomial interpolation of functions continuous on a segment. The results of numerical analysis are presented.",
