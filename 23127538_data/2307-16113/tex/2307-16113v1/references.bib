	issn = {0962-8436, 1471-2970},
	abstract = {In recent years, the concept of self-organization has been used to understand collective behaviour of animals. The central tenet of self-organization is that simple repeated interactions between individuals can produce complex adaptive patterns at the level of the group. Inspiration comes from patterns seen in physical systems, such as spiralling chemical waves, which arise without complexity at the level of the individual units of which the system is composed. The suggestion is that biological structures such as termite mounds, ant trail networks and even human crowds can be explained in terms of repeated interactions between the animals and their environment, without invoking individual complexity. Here, I review cases in which the self-organization approach has been successful in explaining collective behaviour of animal groups and societies. Ant pheromone trail networks, aggregation of cockroaches, the applause of opera audiences and the migration of fish schools have all been accurately described in terms of individuals following simple sets of rules. Unlike the simple units composing physical systems, however, animals are themselves complex entities, and other examples of collective behaviour, such as honey bee foraging with its myriad of dance signals and behavioural cues, cannot be fully understood in terms of simple individuals alone. I argue that the key to understanding collective behaviour lies in identifying the principles of the behavioural algorithms followed by individual animals and of how information flows between the animals. These principles, such as positive feedback, response thresholds and individual integrity, are repeatedly observed in very different animal societies. The future of collective behaviour research lies in classifying these principles, establishing the properties they produce at a group level and asking why they have evolved in so many different and distinct natural systems. Ultimately, this research could inform not only our understanding of animal societies, but also the principles by which we organize our own society.},

	abstract = {In 1990, Kronauer proposed a mathematical model of the effects of light on the human circadian pacemaker. This study presents several refinements to Kronauer's original model of the pacemaker that enable it to predict more accurately the experimental results from a number of different studies of the effects of the intensity, timing, and duration of light stimuli on the human circadian pacemaker. These refinements include the following: The van der Pol oscillator from Kronauer’s model has been replaced with a higher order limit cycle oscillator so that the system’s amplitude recovery is slower near the singularity and faster near the limit cycle; the phase and amplitude of the circadian rhythm in sensitivity to light from Kronauer’s model has been refined so that the peak sensitivity to light on the limit cycle now occurs 4 h before the core body temperature minimum (CBT
              min
              ) and is three times as great as the minimum sensitivity on the limit cycle; the critical phase (at which type 1 phase response curves [PRCs] can be distinguished from type 0 PRCs) that occurs at CBT
              min
              now corresponds to 0.8 h after the minimum of x ( x
              min
              ) in this refined model rather than to the exact timing of x
              min
              as in Kronauer’s model; a direct effect of light on circadian period was incorporated into the model such that as light intensity increases, the period decreases, which is in accordance with Aschoff’s rule.},

	abstract = {The Sal'nikov thermokinetic oscillator is a model chemical reaction consisting of a two-stage decay of some chemical species. The first stage is a straightforward first-order decay process at constant temperature, but the second stage is exothermic, and is assumed to be governed by Arrhenius kinetics. When the containing vessel is wellstirred, the kinetic rate equation for the reaction along with an equation expressing conservation of energy leads to a system of two ordinary differential equations describing the behaviour of the process. The equations are coupled and highly nonlinear, and their solution gives the temperature inside the vessel and the concentration of the intermediate chemical species. Under certain circumstances, sustained periodic oscillations in these two quantities are possible. In this paper, I give a rigorous proof that these remarkable oscillations are not possible for certain combinations of the defining physical parameters. A numerical solution technique for obtaining periodic oscillations in the system is then presented; the method gives results of great accuracy, it automatically determines the stability of the solution, and is capable of computing unstable periodic orbits. Results of extensive numerical investigation are presented, and the occurrence of unstable limit cycles and multiple solutions is discussed in detail.},

	abstract = {Thermoacoustic instabilities in can-annular combus-tors of stationary gas turbines lead to unstable Bloch modes which appear as rotating acoustic pressure waves along the turbine annulus. The multiscale, multiphysical nature of the full problem makes a detailed analysis challenging. In this work, we derive a low-order, coupled oscillators model of an idealized can-annular combustor. The unimodal projection of the Helmholtz equation for the can acoustics is combined with the Rayleigh conductivity, which describes the aeroacoustic coupling between neighbouring cans. Using a Bloch-wave ansatz, the resulting system is reduced to a single equation for the frequency spectrum. A linear stability analysis is then performed to study the perturbation of the spectrum by the can-to-can interaction. It is observed that the acoustic coupling can suppress or amplify thermoacoustic instabilities, raising the potential for instabilities in nominally stable systems.},

            Nonlinear phenomena emerging from the coupled behaviour of a pair of oscillators have attracted considerable research attention over the years, of which, amplitude death (AD) and phase-flip bifurcation (PFB) are two noteworthy examples. Although theoretical research has postulated the coexistence of AD and PFB upon variation of different control parameters, such an occurrence has not been reported in practical systems. Here, we provide the first experimental evidence of the coexistence of AD and PFB in a physical system, comprising of a coupled pair of candle-flame oscillators. As the strength of coupling between the oscillators is increased, we report a decrease in the span of AD region between the states of in-phase and anti-phase oscillations, leading up to a point of PFB. Understanding such a switching of phenomena between AD and PFB helps us to evade their undesirable occurrences such as AD in neuron and brain cells, oscillatory state in prey-predator systems, oscillatory spread of epidemics and so forth.},

In the present study, we aim to study the suppression mechanism of such undesired oscillations in a pair of thermoacoustic oscillators, also known as horizontal Rijke tubes. These oscillators are coupled through a connecting tube whose length and diameter are varied as coupling parameters. With the variation of these parameters, we show the first experimental evidence of rich dynamical phenomena such as synchronization, amplitude death, and phase-flip bifurcation in coupled identical thermoacoustic oscillators. We discover that when frequency and amplitude mismatch are introduced between these oscillators, quenching of oscillations in one or both the oscillators occurs with further ease, through the mechanisms of amplitude death and partial amplitude death. Finally, we show that the effectiveness of coupling is sensitive to the dimensions of the connecting tube which can be directly correlated with the time delay and coupling strength of the system.},

	abstract = {Oscillation death (also called amplitude death), a phenomenon of coupling induced stabilization of an unstable equilibrium, is studied for an arbitrary symmetric complex network with delay-coupled oscillators, and the critical conditions for its linear stability are explicitly obtained. All cases including one oscillator, a pair of oscillators, regular oscillator networks, and complex oscillator networks with delay feedback coupling, can be treated in a unified form. For an arbitrary symmetric network, we find that the corresponding smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian λN (0 \&gt;λN ≥ –1) completely determines the death island, and as λN is located within the insensitive parameter region for nearly all complex networks, the death island keeps nearly the largest and does not sensitively depend on the complex network structures. This insensitivity effect has been tested for many typical complex networks including Watts-Strogatz (WS) and Newman-Watts (NW) small world networks, general scale-free (SF) networks, Erdos-Renyi (ER) random networks, geographical networks, and networks with community structures and is expected to be helpful for our understanding of dynamics on complex networks.},

	abstract = {Thermoacoustic instability is the result of a positive coupling between the acoustic field in the duct and the heat release rate fluctuations from the flame. Recently, in several turbulent combustors, it has been observed that the onset of thermoacoustic instability is preceded by intermittent oscillations, which consist of bursts of periodic oscillations amidst regions of aperiodic oscillations. Quantitative analysis of the intermittency route to thermoacoustic instability has been performed hitherto using the pressure oscillations alone. We perform experiments on a laboratory-scale bluff-body-stabilized turbulent combustor with a backward-facing step at the inlet to obtain simultaneous data of acoustic pressure and heat release rate fluctuations. With this, we show that the onset of thermoacoustic instability is a phenomenon of mutual synchronization between the acoustic pressure and the heat release rate signals, thus emphasizing the importance of the coupling between these non-identical oscillators. We demonstrate that the stable operation corresponds to desynchronized aperiodic oscillations, which, with an increase in the mean velocity of the flow, transition to synchronized periodic oscillations. In between these states, there exists a state of intermittent phase synchronized oscillations, wherein the two oscillators are synchronized during the periodic epochs and desynchronized during the aperiodic epochs of their oscillations. Furthermore, we discover two different types of limit cycle oscillations in our system. We notice a significant increase in the linear correlation between the acoustic pressure and the heat release rate oscillations during the transition from a lower-amplitude limit cycle to a higher-amplitude limit cycle. Further, we present a phenomenological model that qualitatively captures all of the dynamical states of synchronization observed in the experiment. Our analysis shows that the times at which vortices that are shed from the inlet step reach the bluff body play a dominant role in determining the behaviour of the limit cycle oscillations.},

            Coupled oscillators, even identical ones, display a wide range of behaviours, among them synchrony and incoherence. The 2002 discovery of so-called chimera states, states of coexisting synchronized and unsynchronized oscillators, provided a possible link between the two and definitely showed that different parts of the same ensemble can sustain qualitatively different forms of motion. Here, we demonstrate that globally coupled identical oscillators can express a range of coexistence patterns more comprehensive than chimeras. A hierarchy of such states evolves from the fully synchronized solution in a series of cluster-splittings. At the far end of this hierarchy, the states further collide with their own mirror-images in phase space – rendering the motion chaotic, destroying some of the clusters and thereby producing even more intricate coexistence patterns. A sequence of such attractor collisions can ultimately lead to full incoherence of only single asynchronous oscillators. Chimera states, with one large synchronized cluster and else only single oscillators, are found to be just one step in this transition from low- to high-dimensional dynamics.},

These behaviors include time periodic cluster states in which each oscillator is in one of a small number of groups for which all oscillators in each group have the same state which is different from group to group, as well as a behavior in which all oscillators have different states and the macroscopic dynamics of the mean field is chaotic. We argue that this second type of behavior is “extensive” in the sense that the chaotic attractor in the full phase space of the system has a fractal dimension that scales linearly with N and that the number of positive Lyapunov exponents of the attractor also scales linearly with N. An important focus of this paper is the transition between cluster states and extensive chaos as the system is subjected to slow adiabatic parameter change. We observe discontinuous transitions between the cluster states (which correspond to low dimensional dynamics) and the extensively chaotic states. Furthermore, examining the cluster state, as the system approaches the discontinuous transition to extensive chaos, we find that the oscillator population distribution between the clusters continually evolves so that the cluster state is always marginally stable. This behavior is used to reveal the mechanism of the discontinuous transition. We also apply the Kaplan-Yorke formula to study the fractal structure of the extensively chaotic attractors.},

              INTRODUCTION
              A paramount contemporary scientific challenge is to understand and control networks. General studies of networks are essential to a variety of disciplines, including materials science, neuroscience, electrical engineering, and microbiology. To date, most studies are observational or “top-down,” relying on phenomenological models of nodal behavior deduced from data extracted from observations of the entire network. On the other hand, oscillator synchronization provides a popular “bottom-up” experimental paradigm for studies of network behavior. Synchronization occurs when a large number of networked oscillators tend to phase-lock and reach global consensus, despite the presence of internal disorder (such as differences in oscillator frequencies). However, the state of global consensus is not the only dynamical state manifested within networks of coupled oscillators. Recent work has discovered long-lived states that spontaneously break the underlying symmetries of the network, even when its constituent nodes are identical. Understanding the mechanisms that underlie these exotic symmetry-breaking dynamics will be of general benefit to network science and engineering. To enable experimental studies with unprecedented control and resolution, we developed an oscillator network based on nonlinear nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS).
            
            
              RATIONALE
              Complex oscillator dynamics emerge in a variety of settings. Previous experimental studies on symmetry breaking in oscillator networks have manifested such complex behavior only by implementing complicated coupling mechanisms designed for that purpose. By contrast, real-world networks are often dominated by simple coupling, so these previous experimental results cannot readily be generalized. Here, exotic states are seen to emerge within NEMS oscillator networks, just beyond the weak coupling limit in simple settings.
            
            
              RESULTS
              Using an array of coupled nonlinear NEMS oscillators, we observed spontaneous symmetry breaking in a simple and general network setting. These NEMS oscillator nodes were made to be nearly identical, and their fastest dynamical time scales were short enough to generate large datasets, permitting observation and statistical analyses of exotic, slowly emerging network phenomena. In addition, NEMS are very stable, so that transient effects within the network were able to relax within experimental time scales. We examined the network dynamics in detail throughout parameter space and showed experimentally that a simple network of oscillators can reproduce the predictions of theoretical models with explicit complex interactions. We fully explained these phenomena by applying a higher-order phase approximation to the full oscillator model. As strong evidence of the symmetry-breaking argument, we delineated the symmetry subgroups associated with each state.
            
            
              CONCLUSION
              Our results show that simple real-world oscillator networks display complex and exotic system states without the need for complex interactions. Our findings can be applied to observational studies of the behavior of natural or engineered oscillator networks. This work clearly elucidates how a 16-dimensional system, comprising eight magnitude-phase oscillators, collapses into synchronized states that evolve within lower-dimensional subspaces. Real-world networks based on our nonlinear NEMS oscillator platform will enable further insight into the mechanisms by which such behavior emerges in more complex topologies at even larger network scales.

            Synchronization of oscillators, a phenomenon found in a wide variety of natural and engineered systems, is typically understood through a reduction to a first-order phase model with simplified dynamics. Here, by exploiting the precision and flexibility of nanoelectromechanical systems, we examined the dynamics of a ring of quasi-sinusoidal oscillators at and beyond first order. Beyond first order, we found exotic states of synchronization with highly complex dynamics, including weak chimeras, decoupled states, traveling waves, and inhomogeneous synchronized states. Through theory and experiment, we show that these exotic states rely on complex interactions emerging out of networks with simple linear nearest-neighbor coupling. This work provides insight into the dynamical richness of complex systems with weak nonlinearities and local interactions.},

Here, we present a comprehensive theoretical study on the manifestation of these exquisite phenomena in a reduced-order model of two coupled Rijke tube oscillators, which are prototypical thermoacoustic oscillators. We characterize the dynamical behaviors of two such identical and non-identical oscillators by varying both system parameters (such as the uncoupled amplitudes and the natural frequencies of the oscillators) and coupling parameters (such as the coupling strength and the coupling delay). The present model captures all the dynamical phenomena—namely, synchronization, phase-flip bifurcation, amplitude death, and partial amplitude death—observed previously in experiments on coupled Rijke tubes. By performing numerical simulations and deriving approximate analytical solutions, we systematically decipher the conditions and the bifurcations underlying the aforementioned phenomena. The insights provided by this study can be used to understand the interactions between multiple cans in gas turbine combustors and develop control strategies to avert undesirable thermoacoustic oscillations in them.},

	abstract = {Improved turbulence modeling remains a major open problem in mathematical physics. Turbulence is notoriously challenging, in part due to its multiscale nature and the fact that large-scale coherent structures cannot be disentangled from small-scale fluctuations. This closure problem is emblematic of a greater challenge in complex systems, where coarse-graining and statistical mechanics descriptions break down. This work demonstrates an alternative data-driven modeling approach to learn nonlinear models of the coherent structures, approximating turbulent fluctuations as state-dependent stochastic forcing. We demonstrate this approach on a high–Reynolds number turbulent wake experiment, showing that our model reproduces empirical power spectra and probability distributions. The model is interpretable, providing insights into the physical mechanisms underlying the symmetry-breaking behavior in the wake. This work suggests a path toward low-dimensional models of globally unstable turbulent flows from experimental measurements, with broad implications for other multiscale systems.

Fish slow down to avoid collisions and swim at a constant depth, whereas birds fly at low variability of speed and lose altitude during turning. In both the models of fish and birds, the ‘bearing angle’ to the nearest neighbour emerges as a side-effect of the ‘blind angle’ behind individuals and when group size becomes larger, temporary subgroups may increase the complexity of group shape and internal structure. We discuss evidence for model-based predictions and provide a list of new predictions to be tested empirically.},

At the individual’s level, our model correctly reproduces the rate at which people acquire new acquaintances as well as how they allocate their interactions among existing edges. On the macroscopic side, the model reproduces the key topological and dynamical features of social networks: the broad distribution of degree and activities, the average clustering coefficient and the community structure.

            We study the joint effect of the non-linearity of interactions and noise on coevolutionary dynamics. We choose the coevolving voter model as a prototype framework for this problem. By numerical simulations and analytical approximations we find three main phases that differ in the absolute magnetisation and the size of the largest component: a consensus phase, a coexistence phase, and a dynamical fragmentation phase. More detailed analysis reveals inner differences in these phases, allowing us to divide two of them further. In the consensus phase we can distinguish between a weak or alternating consensus and a strong consensus, in which the system remains in the same state for the whole realisation of the stochastic dynamics. In the coexistence phase we distinguish a fully-mixing phase and a structured coexistence phase, where the number of active links drops significantly due to the formation of two homogeneous communities. Our numerical observations are supported by an analytical description using a pair approximation approach and an ad-hoc calculation for the transition between the coexistence and dynamical fragmentation phases. Our work shows how simple interaction rules including the joint effect of non-linearity, noise, and coevolution lead to complex structures relevant in the description of social systems.},

The proposed design of dynamic coupling facilitates the onset of a plethora of asymptotic states including synchronous states, amplitude death states, oscillation death states, a mixed state (complete synchronized cluster and small amplitude desynchronized domain), and bistable states (coexistence of two attractors). The dynamical transitions from the oscillatory to the death state are characterized using an average temporal interaction approximation, which agrees with the numerical results in temporal interaction. A first-order phase transition behavior may change into a second-order transition in spatial dynamic interaction solely depending on the choice of initial conditions in the bistable regime. However, this possible abrupt first-order like transition is completely non-existent in the case of temporal dynamic interaction. Besides the study on periodic Stuart–Landau systems, we present results for the paradigmatic chaotic model of Rössler oscillators and the MacArthur ecological model.},

	abstract = {The synchronization of coupled oscillators is a fascinating manifestation of self-organization that nature uses to orchestrate essential processes of life, such as the beating of the heart. Although it was long thought that synchrony and disorder were mutually exclusive steady states for a network of identical oscillators, numerous theoretical studies in recent years have revealed the intriguing possibility of “chimera states,” in which the symmetry of the oscillator population is broken into a synchronous part and an asynchronous part. However, a striking lack of empirical evidence raises the question of whether chimeras are indeed characteristic of natural systems. This calls for a palpable realization of chimera states without any fine-tuning, from which physical mechanisms underlying their emergence can be uncovered. Here, we devise a simple experiment with mechanical oscillators coupled in a hierarchical network to show that chimeras emerge naturally from a competition between two antagonistic synchronization patterns. We identify a wide spectrum of complex states, encompassing and extending the set of previously described chimeras. Our mathematical model shows that the self-organization observed in our experiments is controlled by elementary dynamical equations from mechanics that are ubiquitous in many natural and technological systems. The symmetry-breaking mechanism revealed by our experiments may thus be prevalent in systems exhibiting collective behavior, such as power grids, optomechanical crystals, or cells communicating via quorum sensing in microbial populations.},

Here, we show that similar multistable states demonstrating partial frequency synchronization, can be observed in simple experiments with identical mechanical oscillators, namely pendula. The mathematical model of our experiment shows that the observed multistable states are controlled by elementary dynamical equations, derived from Newton’s laws that are ubiquitous in many physical and engineering systems.

The modeling of this cross-talk area is crucial to predict the thermo-acoustic modes of the system. Thanks to the discrete rotational symmetry, Bloch wave theory can be exploited to reduce the system to a longitudinal combustor with a complex-valued equivalent outlet reflection coefficient, which models the annular gap. The present study reviews existing low-order models based purely on geometrical parameters and compares them to 2D Helmholtz simulations. We demonstrate that the modeling of the gap as a thin annulus is not suited for can-annular combustors and that the Rayleigh conductivity model only gives qualitative agreement. We then propose an extension for the equivalent reflection coefficient that accounts not only for geometrical but also flow parameters, by means of a characteristic length. The proposed model is in excellent agreement with 2D simulations and is able to correctly capture the eigenfrequencies of the system. We then perform a Design of Experiments study that allows us to explore various configurations and build correlations for the characteristic length. Finally, we discuss the validity limits of the proposed low-order modeling approach.},

Statistically significant developmental differences existed in frequency locking (matching limb frequency to metronome or other limb) and phase locking (stably coupling to one point in the cycle). The intent to couple proved to be as important in producing less variable coupling patterns than adding a metronome beat. In addition, children's groups differed in variability within metronome conditions; these may be due to the increasing challenge encountered in coupling at a higher frequency.

We show that this disparity in occurrence is due to fundamental limits on the size of networks that can sustain anti-phase synchronization. We study the influence of network structure and coupling conditions on anti-phase synchronization in networks composed of coupled Stuart-Landau oscillators. The dependence of probability of anti-phase synchronization on connectivity of the network, strength of interaction over distance, and symmetry of the network is illustrated. Regardless of favourable network conditions, we show that anti-phase synchronization is limited to small networks, typically smaller than 20 nodes.},
