\section{Introduction} \label{sec:intro}
Clustering is a key concept in data analysis that involves organizing `similar' data into groups. One of the most fundamental and well-studied objectives is the \emph{$k$-center objective}. Specifically, given a metric space with $n$ points and a positive integer $k \leq n$, the goal of the \emph{$k$-center problem} is to select $k$ points, referred to as \emph{centers}, such that the maximum distance of any point in the metric space to its closest center is minimized. 
It is known that $k$-center is NP-hard to approximate within a factor of $(2-\epsilon)$ for any $\epsilon > 0$~\cite{HsuN79}.
Due to its popularity, $k$-center has been considered under several algorithmic frameworks, including approximation algorithms~\cite{HsuN79,Gonzalez85,HochbaumS86,plesnik1980computational,FederG88}, parameterized complexity~\cite{Feldmann15,BandyapadhyayFM22}, massive parallel computation (MPC) model~\cite{CeccarelloPP19,BeraDGK22,BergBM23}, and beyond worst-case analysis~\cite{BalcanHW20}, among others. This problem also serves as a testbed for developing fundamental algorithmic definitions and paradigms, which are then often applied to solving other variants of clustering objectives.

Clustering in the \emph{dynamic setting} has received increasing attention in recent years. 
This line of work was initiated by Charikar et al.~\cite{DBLP:conf/stoc/CharikarCFM97} who considered the problem of minimizing cluster diameters under the insertions of new points in an underlying metric space.
Under both point insertions and deletions, the $k$-center problem was considered by Chan et al.~\cite{chan2018fully}, who achieved a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation in $O(k^2 \epsilon^{-1} \log{\Delta})$ amortized update time, where $\Delta$ is the aspect ratio of the metric space. 
Later on, the amortized update time was improved to $O(k \epsilon^{-1} \textrm{poly} \log (n, \Delta))$ by Bateni et al.~\cite{BateniEFHJMW23}. 
This is almost optimal considering that even in the static setting, any algorithm for $k$-clustering problems (including $k$-center, $k$-median, and $k$-means) on point sets in arbitrary metric spaces that achieves any non-trivial approximation, must make at least $\Omega(nk)$ distance queries, and in turn must take $\Omega(nk)$ time~\cite{BateniEFHJMW23}.
These results spurred several follow-up works that studied other point sets-based clustering objectives such as $k$-means~\cite{Cohen-AddadHPSS19, HenzingerK20}, $k$-median~\cite{GuoKLX21}, facility location~\cite{GoranciHL18, GuoKLX20, GoranciHLSS21, BhattacharyaLP22}, and sum-of-radii~\cite{HenzingerLM20} in the dynamic setting. 

An important case of $k$-center clustering is when the input metric is induced by a graph $G$ on $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. Naturally, any $k$-center algorithm that works with points in arbitrary metric spaces, can be applied on top of the graphical metric obtained by computing all-pairs shortest paths in $G$. However, the latter leads to slow running times, especially since it could make a sparse graph $G$ very dense. In the static setting, Thorup~\cite{Thorup04} gave a faster algorithm for the $k$-center problem in the graph setting, achieving a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation in $\tilde{O}(m\epsilon^{-1})$ time, where $\tilde{O}$ hides polylogarithmic factors in $n$ and in the maximum edge-weight of the graph. This result was recently revisited by the work of Eppstein et al.~\cite{eppstein2015approximate} and even more recently by Abboud et al.~\cite{AbboudCLM23} who gave a refined and simpler algorithm for $k$-center on graphs.

We note that graph clustering has also received attention in the machine learning community, albeit for the closely related objective of $k$-means~\cite{RattiganMJ07}. 
They observe the computational challenges involving graphs (see also~\cite[Section~2.3]{Aggarwal2010}) and specifically the output sensitivity due to distance changes caused by edge updates. 

Motivated by these developments, we study the fundamental problem of \emph{dynamic $k$-center on graphs}. In comparison to the model with dynamic point sets in arbitrary metric spaces, we remark that the model with dynamic graphs is more challenging since (i) there is no guarantee of having oracle access to all-pairs shortest paths distances, and (ii) a single edge update may have a \emph{global effect} on the underlying graph metric, forcing a large number of vertex pairs to change their shortest path distance. This is also why we cannot use other black-box approaches such as a distance oracle of the metric completion of the graph.

To that end, we ask the natural question of to what extent one can leverage the structure of graphical $k$-center in the context of obtaining faster algorithms for dynamic $k$-center on graphs:

\begin{center}
    \emph{Are there efficient algorithms for $k$-center on graphs undergoing edge updates?}
\end{center}

\subsection{Our Contribution} 

In this paper, we answer the question in the affirmative. 
Our first contribution is a fully dynamic $k$-center algorithm that follows from prior work using a surprisingly simple trick.
\begin{restatable}{theorem}{fullydynamickcenter}\label{thm:fully-dynamic approx}
Given a weighted undirected graph $G=(V,E,w)$ subject to edge updates, an integer parameter $k \geq 1$, and a positive constant parameter $\epsilon\le 1/2$, there are two fully dynamic algorithms for the $k$-center problem on graphs, that maintain a $(2+\epsilon)$-approximation with the following guarantees (based on the current value of the matrix multiplication exponent):
\begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=-1ex,partopsep=1ex,parsep=1ex]
    \item Deterministic algorithm with $O(kn^{1.529}\epsilon^{-2})$ worst-case update time, if $G$ has uniform weights; 
    \item Randomized algorithm, against an adaptive adversary, with $O(kn^{1.823} \epsilon^{-2})$ worst-case update time, if $G$ has general weights.
\end{enumerate}
Both algorithms have preprocessing time $O(n^{2.373} \epsilon^{-2} \log \epsilon^{-1})$.
\end{restatable}

Note that our update time bounds match up to an $ \tilde O (k) $ factor, those of the state-of-the-art fully-dynamic single-source distance approximation algorithms with multiplicative error $(1+\epsilon)$~\cite{BrandN19,BFN22}.
Matching this bound is a natural goalpost for dynamic $k$-center algorithms maintaining the $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximate distance of each vertex to its closest center, because such distance approximations are sufficient to return a $(2 + \epsilon)$-approximation for graph diameter when $ k = 1 $ and the fastest known approach for this is to use a dynamic single-source distance approximation algorithm.
Our algorithms---and to the best of our knowledge all related dynamic $k$-center algorithms on general metrics---do have this desirable property of maintaining the $(1 + \epsilon)$-approximate distance of each vertex to its closest center.
Moreover, the previous result is a reduction to the problem of maintaining $k$-source approximate shortest paths in a fully dynamic setting; hence any improvement on the shortest paths algorithms directly improves the running time of our algorithms as well.

The above suggests that in order to achieve faster running times, we need to consider \emph{partially dynamic algorithms} for the $k$-center problem on graphs, where edge updates are restricted to only edge insertions or edge deletions. In particular, the insertions-only algorithms (also known as the \emph{incremental setting}) in the context of clustering are particularly well-motivated from a practical viewpoint. For example, real-world graphs such as co-authorship networks are incremental since the fact that two scientists co-authoring a research paper (almost) never changes over time. Our main result regarding the incremental setting is the following. 

\begin{restatable}{theorem}{incrkcentfappr}\label{th:incr_kcent_4appr}
    Given a weighted undirected graph $G = (V, E, w)$ subject to edge insertions, an integer parameter $k \geq 1$, and a positive constant parameter $\epsilon<1$, there is
    a randomized incremental $(4 + \epsilon)$-approximation algorithm for the $k$-center problem on graphs, which w.h.p.~is correct and w.h.p.~has $kn^{o(1)}$ amortized update time.
\end{restatable}

To complete the picture of partially dynamic algorithms, we also study the $k$-center problem on graphs undergoing edge deletions only, known as the \emph{decremental} setting. Here, we obtain an algorithm that achieves a tight $(2+\epsilon)$ approximation ratio. 

\begin{restatable}{theorem}{deckcenttappr} \label{th:dec_kcent_2appr}
    Given a weighted undirected graph $G = (V, E, w)$ subject to edge deletions, an integer parameter $k \geq 1$,
    and a positive constant parameter $\epsilon < 1$, there is a deterministic decremental 
    $(2 + \epsilon)$-approximation  algorithm for the $k$-center problem on graphs, with
    $kn^{o(1)}$ amortized update time over a sequence of $\Theta(m)$ updates.
\end{restatable}

We note that the $n^{o(1)}$ factors in the running time are also due to using partially dynamic approximate single-source shortest paths (SSSP) algorithms, which is inherent in our bounds based on similar reasoning as in the fully dynamic setting.


\paragraph{Outline.}
In Section~\ref{sec:overview}, we give an overview of our algorithm and also discuss the main challenges we face in dynamic graphs, as opposed to point sets.
In Section~\ref{sec:reduction}, we review a well-known reduction that relates the $k$-center problem to finding a maximal independent set on a graph. This reduction is fundamental to our partially dynamic algorithms.
Section~\ref{sec:incremental} presents our primary technical contribution, showcasing the incremental algorithm of Theorem~\ref{th:incr_kcent_4appr}.
Section~\ref{sec:decremental} completes the partially dynamic picture by providing the decremental algorithm of Theorem~\ref{th:dec_kcent_2appr}.
In Section~\ref{sec:fullydynamic}, we explore the fully-dynamic setting, in which we use a different type of algorithm to prove Theorem~\ref{thm:fully-dynamic approx}. Unlike the reduction presented in Section~\ref{sec:reduction}, our approach here is based on the greedy algorithm of Gonzalez~\cite{Gonzalez85}.
In addition to the set of centers, we can also answer other natural queries, such as the corresponding center for each vertex. We briefly discuss this in Appendix~\ref{apx:queries}.
