  "abstract": "The well-posedness is established for multi-dimensional mean-field stochastic Volterra equations with Lipschitz continuous coefficients and allowing for singular kernels as well as for one-dimensional mean-field stochastic Volterra equations with Hölder continuous diffusion coefficients and sufficiently regular kernels. In these different settings, quantitative, pointwise propagation of chaos results are derived for the associated Volterra type interacting particle systems.",
