  "abstract": "Scale transformations of cosmological models based on a statistical system of degenerate fermions with a scalar Higgs interaction are studied. The similarity properties of cosmological models are revealed under the scale transformation of their fundamental parameters. The laws of transformation of the coordinates of singular points and eigenvalues of the characteristic matrix of the dynamical system of the cosmological model under its scale transformations are established. With the help of the previously studied dynamical system of scalarly charged fermions is transformed to new variables and modified to a dynamical system with a nondegenerate characteristic matrix and its nondegenerate branch, the singular points and eigenvalues of the characteristic matrix are found, which coincide with the corresponding values for the vacuum field model. Examples of numerical simulation of such cosmological models are given.\n  Keywords: scalarly charged plasma, cosmological model, Higgs scalar field, similarity trans\\-for\\-mation, qualitative analysis.",
