Now that we have derived and shown the validity of the \gls{ema} Scaling Rule, 
we verify it empirically.
The experiments validate the \gls{ema} Scaling Rule for a variety of uses of \gls{ema} and are ordered by increasing influence of the role of \gls{ema} on the optimization procedure, see \Cref{tab:different-ema}.
