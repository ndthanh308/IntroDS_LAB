This work shows how to adapt \gls{ml} optimization in the presence of a model \gls{ema}.
There are a number of benefits to this:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=0.75cm]
    \item Scaling rules democratize the training of \gls{ml} models: they give \gls{ml} researchers the ability to replicate the optimization of large scale systems, even if those researchers \emph{do not} have access to i) significant parallel computational resources \emph{or} ii) the technical tooling to do so.
    \item Our \gls{ema} Scaling Rule lowers compute usage as it removes the necessity for a hyperparameter search over momenta; in the case where our scaling assumptions hold, if we know the value of the optimal momentum $\rho_B$ at some batch size $B$ (for example, the momentum that gives the best transfer performance), then the optimal value at another batch size $\hat B$ is exactly the one given by the \gls{ema} Scaling Rule $\hat\rho=\rho_B^\kappa$, for scaling $\kappa=\hat B/B$.
    \item Our \gls{ema} Scaling Rule enables researchers to more quickly iterate through experimental ideas, and opens up access to large-scale training (for example, larger models and larger datasets) for Pseudo-Labeling and \gls{ssl} techniques.
\end{enumerate}
These points have potential negative consequences:
\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=0.75cm]
    \item As our \gls{ema} Scaling Rule enables researchers to iterate the same experiments more quickly, and perform large-scale training with \gls{ema}-based methods, this may encourage a greater number of experiments, or the training of larger models. 
    Either of these possibilities leads to greater energy consumption.
    \item As the need to determine momentum hyperparameters has now been removed, researchers who were previously discouraged from attempting to scale these methods due to an \emph{extra} hyperparameter to tune may begin to perform such experiments, leading, once more, to greater energy consumption.
\end{enumerate}
The environmental impact of each of these two points may be significant.
