Now that we have derived and shown the validity of the \gls{ema} Scaling Rule, 
we verify it empirically.
The experiments validate the \gls{ema} Scaling Rule for a variety of uses of \gls{ema} and are ordered by increasing influence of the role of \gls{ema} on the optimization procedure (see \Cref{tab:different-ema}).
The baseline in all of our experiments is \emph{without the EMA Scaling Rule}, which applies all known relevant scaling rules \emph{except} the EMA Scaling Rule, and represents previous best practice.
