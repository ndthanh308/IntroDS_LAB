  "abstract": "Quasi-Monte Carlo methods have become the industry standard in computer graphics. For that purpose, efficient algorithms for low discrepancy sequences are discussed. In addition, numerical pitfalls encountered in practice are revealed. We then take a look at massively parallel quasi-Monte Carlo integro-approximation for image synthesis by light transport simulation. Beyond superior uniformity, low discrepancy points may be optimized with respect to additional criteria, such as noise characteristics at low sampling rates or the quality of low-dimensional projections.",
