  "abstract": "Earthquakes vary in size over many orders of magnitude, yet the scaling of the earthquake energy budget remains enigmatic. We propose that fundamentally different \"small-slip\" and \"large-slip\" fracture processes govern earthquakes. We combine seismological observations with a physics-based mechanical earthquake model under flash-heating friction. We find that dynamic weakening and restrengthening effects are non-negligible in the energy budget of small earthquakes and establish a simple linear scaling relationship between small-slip fracture energy and fault size. We use supercomputing to apply this scaling and unveil volumetric \"Mode-4\" earthquake cascades involving $>700$ multi-scale fractures within a fault damage zone, capable of dynamically triggering large earthquakes. Our findings provide an intuitive explanation of seismicity across all scales with important implications for comprehending earthquake nucleation and multi-fault rupture cascades.",
