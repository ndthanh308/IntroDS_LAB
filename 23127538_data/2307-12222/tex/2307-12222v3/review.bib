journal = {Reports on Progress in Physics},
abstract = {This paper reviews the work on cavity quantum electrodynamics of free atoms. In recent years, cavity experiments have also been conducted on a variety of solid-state systems resulting in many interesting applications, of which microlasers, photon bandgap structures and quantum dot structures in cavities are outstanding examples. Although these phenomena and systems are very interesting, discussion is limited here to free atoms and mostly single atoms because these systems exhibit clean quantum phenomena and are not disturbed by a variety of other effects. At the centre of our review is the work on the one-atom maser, but we also give a survey of the entire field, using free atoms in order to show the large variety of problems dealt with. The cavity interaction can be separated into two main regimes: the weak coupling in cavity or cavity-like structures with low quality factors Q and the strong coupling when high-Q cavities are involved. The weak coupling leads to modification of spontaneous transitions and level shifts, whereas the strong coupling enables one to observe a periodic exchange of photons between atoms and the radiation field. In this case, atoms and photons are entangled, this being the basis for a variety of phenomena observed, some of them leading to interesting applications in quantum information processing. The cavity experiments with free atoms reached a new domain with the advent of experiments in the visible spectral region. A review on recent achievements in this area is also given.}

journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
abstract = {The Advanced LIGO gravitational wave detectors are next generation instruments which will replace the existing initial LIGO detectors. They are currently being constructed and installed. Advanced LIGO strain sensitivity is designed to be about a factor 10 better than initial LIGO over a broad band and usable to 10 Hz, in contrast to 40 Hz for initial LIGO. This is expected to allow for detections and significant astrophysics in most categories of gravitational waves. To achieve this sensitivity, all hardware subsystems are being replaced with improvements. Designs and expected performance are presented for the seismic isolation, suspensions, optics and laser subsystems. Possible enhancements to Advanced LIGO, either to resolve problems that may arise and/or to allow for improved performance, are now being researched. Some of these enhancements are discussed along with some potential technology being considered for detectors beyond Advanced LIGO.}

After GEO 600 participated in science runs with other first-generation detectors, a program known as GEO-HF began in 2009. The goal was to improve the detector sensitivity at high frequencies, around 1 kHz and above,with technologically advanced yet minimally invasive upgrades. Simultaneously, the detector would record science quality data in between commissioning activities. As of early 2014, all of the planned upgrades have been carried out and sensitivity improvements of up to a factor of four at the high-frequency end of the observation band have been achieved. Besides science data collection, an experimental program is ongoing with the goal to further improve the sensitivity and evaluate future detector technologies. We summarize the results of the GEO-HF program to date and discuss its successes and challenges.}

Given a desired device function, the theory describes the electromagnetic properties that turn this function into fact. We consider media that facilitate space-time transformations and include negative refraction. Our theory unifies the concepts operating behind the scenes of perfect invisibility devices, perfect lenses, the optical Aharonov–Bohm effect and electromagnetic analogues of the event horizon, and may lead to further applications.}

Since the original discoveries of Hawking radiation and the Unruh effect, it has been known that incorporating the concepts of quantum theory into relativistic settings can produce new and surprising effects. However it is only in recent years that it has become appreciated that the basic concepts involved in quantum information science undergo significant revision in relativistic settings, and that new phenomena arise when quantum entanglement is combined with relativity.  A number of examples illustrate that point. Quantum teleportation fidelity is affected between observers in uniform relative acceleration. Entanglement is an observer-dependent property that is degraded from the perspective of accelerated observers moving in flat spacetime. Entanglement can also be extracted from the vacuum of relativistic quantum field theories, and used to distinguish peculiar motion from cosmological expansion. The new quantum information-theoretic framework of quantum channels in terms of completely positive maps and operator algebras now provides powerful tools for studying matters of causality and information flow in quantum field theory in curved spacetimes.

This focus issue provides a sample of the state of the art in research in RQI. Some of the articles in this issue review the subject while others provide interesting new results that will stimulate further research.   What makes the subject all the more exciting is that it is beginning to enter the stage at which actual experiments can be contemplated, and some of the articles appearing in this issue discuss some of these exciting new developments.

The subject of RQI pulls together concepts and ideas from special relativity, quantum optics, general relativity, quantum communication and quantum computation. The high level of current interest in these subjects is exemplified by the recent award of the 2012 Nobel Prize in Physics to Serge Haroche and David J Wineland for ground-breaking experimental methods that enable measuring and manipulation of individual quantum systems.  It is our hope that this issue will encourage new researchers to enter this rapidly developing and exciting new field.

In the non-local measurement of a Lorentz invariant, the rate of radiation energy emission is proposed as a necessary and sufficient criterion for the emission of radiation at a given time. This measurement is a field measurement which can be performed at any distance from the charge and need not be made in the wave zone. It can be regarded as an operational definition of radiation in terms of rate of energy emission. These results permit a simple derivation of the equation of motion of a charged particle which avoids the self-energy difficulties. A question concerning the principle of equivalence and radiation in uniformly accelerated motion is answered.},

A calculation indicates that the number of photons created is immeasurably small for nonrelativistic mirror trajectories and continuous mirror velocities. Automorphic transformations of the wave equation are used to calculate mode functions for the cavity, and adiabatic expansions for these transformations are derived. The electromagnetic field may be coupled to matter by means of a transformation from the interaction picture to the Heisenberg picture; this transformation is generated by an interaction Hamiltonian.}",

abstract = {We consider a proton and an electron bound by scalar electrodynamics with the proton forced by an external agency to move along an asymptotically inertial trajectory. We apply previously developed methods for atoms constrained to move relativistically (Barton and Calogeracos, 2005) to examine spontaneous excitation of the atom accompanied by photon emission. In the limit where the asymptotically inertial trajectory tends to the well-known hyperbolic trajectory we do recover the constant transition rate first obtained by Unruh a long time ago: the atom radiates as if it is found in a bath of photons at the Unruh temperature (Barton and Calogeracos, 2008 [7]). In the case of a truncated hyperbolic trajectory and for small accelerations we obtain a transition probability proportional to the square of the acceleration scaled by the acceleration at the Bohr orbit. On the other hand it is to be noted that the Unruh transition rate is exponentially small for small accelerations. Hence accelerations of finite duration provide a more promising context for the observation of spontaneous excitation.}

ABSTRACT = {By considering the interaction between a two-atom system and the vacuum massless scalar field in the viewpoint of an instantaneously inertial observer, we study the rates of transition of a uniformly accelerated two-atom system in the symmetric/antisymmetric entangled state near a reflecting boundary and in a cavity, respectively. We find that both the downward transition | &psi; &plusmn; &rang; &rarr; | g A g B &rang; and the upward transition | &psi; &plusmn; &rang; &rarr; | e A e B &rang; occur for the accelerated two-atom system, as in sharp contrast with the case of a static two-atom system, in which the upward transition can never happen. Similar to the rates of transition of atoms immersed in a thermal bath with the FDU temperature, both the downward transition rate and the upward transition rate are characterized by the Plank factor ( e 2 &pi; &omega; 0 / a &minus; 1 ) &minus; 1 . This character of the transition rates is very different from the other radiative properties of the accelerated two-atom system, such as the resonance interatomic energy, for which the revisions of the effects of uniform acceleration are never characterized by such a factor. We show with analytical and numerical results that both the downward transition and the upward transition processes can be effectively manipulated by the atomic non-inertial motion and by the presence of boundaries. By comparing the upward transition rate with the downward transition rate, we discover that, when &omega; 0 ≫ a , with &omega; 0 and a being the energy space and the proper acceleration of the two-atom system, the disentanglement caused by the upward transition is negligible, while, if &omega; 0 ≪ a , the disentanglement caused by the upward transition becomes as important as that caused by the downward transition.},

isbn = {0470259302},
publisher = {Wiley Publishing},
abstract = {The theory of molecular quantum electrodynamics and its application to a number of intermolecular interactions Considerable advances have taken place in quantum electrodynamical theory of intermolecular forces. Virtually impacting all areas of science, molecular quantum electrodynamics (MQED) has been successfully applied to numerous radiation-molecule and molecule-molecule processes. Molecular Quantum Electrodynamics delves in depth into the MQED theory of long-range intermolecular forces, offering a variety of physical viewpoints and calculational techniques. The text provides an introduction and background on: Field theoretic treatments, including the second quantized Maxwell field formulation Intermolecular potential and a semi-classical perturbation theory treatment of short- and long-range forces Retarded dispersion interactions including discriminatory forces Intermolecular interactions in a radiation field Energy shift and transfer rate in relation to specific two- and many-body forces Molecular Quantum Electrodynamics provides an essential resource for chemists, physicists, biophysicists, materials scientists, and nanochemists interested in exploring the theory and application of MQED.}
