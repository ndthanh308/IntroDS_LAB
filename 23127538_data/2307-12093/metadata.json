  "abstract": "Magnetic excitations in the spin chain candidate Sr$_2$V$_3$O$_9$ have been investigated by inelastic neutron scattering on a single crystal sample. A spinon continuum with a bandwidth of $\\sim22$ meV is observed along the chain formed by alternating magnetic V$^{4+}$ and nonmagnetic V$^{5+}$ ions. Incipient magnetic Bragg peaks due to weak ferromagnetic interchain couplings emerge when approaching the magnetic transition at $T_N\\sim 5.3$ K while the excitations remain gapless within the instrumental resolution. Comparisons to the Bethe ansatz, density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations, and effective field theories confirm Sr$_2$V$_3$O$_9$ as a host of weakly coupled $S = 1/2$ chains dominated by antiferromagnetic intrachain interactions of $\\sim7.1$(1) meV.",
