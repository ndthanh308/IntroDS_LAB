@article{Boudon:2023aa,
	abstract = {We investigate the imprints of accretion and dynamical friction on the gravitational-wave signals emitted by binary black holes embedded in a scalar dark matter cloud. As a key feature in this work, we focus on scalar fields with a repulsive self-interaction that balances against the self-gravity of the cloud. To a first approximation, the phase of the gravitational-wave signal receives extra correction terms at $-4$PN and $-5.5$PN orders, relative to the prediction of vacuum general relativity, due to accretion and dynamical friction, respectively. Future observations by LISA and B-DECIGO have the potential to detect these effects for a large range of scalar masses~$m_\mathrm{DM}$ and self-interaction couplings~$\lambda_4$; observations by ET and Advanced~LIGO could also detect these effects, albeit in a more limited region of parameter space. Crucially, we find that even if a dark matter cloud has a bulk density~$\rho_0$ that is too dilute to be detected via the effects of dynamical friction, the imprints of accretion could still be observable because it is controlled by the independent scale $\rho_a = 4 m_{\rm DM}^4 c^3/(3 \lambda_4 \hbar^3)$. In the models we consider, the infalling dark matter increases in density up to this characteristic scale $\rho_a$ near the Schwarzschild radius, which sets the accretion rate and its associated impact on the gravitational~waveform.},

@article{Foglizzo:aa,
	abstract = {We prove that the sonic surface of axisymmetric meridional stationary flows is always attached to the accretor, however small, if the adiabatic index of the gas is gamma=5/3. Using local expansions near a point-like accretor, we extend Bondi's classification of spherically symmetric flows to axisymmetric flows, introducing the possibility of angular sectors reached by no flow lines, and singular directions of infinite mass flux, in addition to the angular regions of subsonic and supersonic accretion. For gamma<5/3, we show the impossibility of subsonic accretion onto a point-like accretor when the entropy of the flow is not uniform. The special case gamma=5/3 is treated separately. We analyse the influence of the adiabatic index and Mach number of the flow at infinity on the mass accretion rate of shocked spherical flows. We propose an interpolation formula for the mass accretion rate of axisymmetric flows as a function of the Mach number and the adiabatic index, in the range 9/7<gamma<5/3.},

	abstract = {The drag force experienced by a gravitational body moving in a straight-line trajectory through a homogeneous isothermal gaseous medium of given sound speed is investigated numerically. For perturbers with constant velocity, linear theory describes successfully the temporal evolution and magnitude of the force. The result obtained recently by E. Ostriker---that for Mach numbers ℳ = 1-2 the force is stronger in a gaseous medium than in a collisionless medium, as described by the standard Chandrasekhar formula---is confirmed. The corresponding minimum impact radius rmin for a body described with a Plummer model with core radius Rsoft is rmin/Rsoft ≈ 2.25. When ℳ &lt; 1, the drag force is strongly suppressed, which is consistent with Ostriker's results but in disagreement with the Chandrasekhar formula. However, when the perturber is decelerated by its own wake to ℳ &lt; 1, the effective drag force remains initially somewhat larger than the value in the case of constant velocity because it takes some time to get rid of the wake that was generated during its supersonic history.},

@article{KEPPENS2021316,
	abstract = {We report on the latest additions to our open-source, block-grid adaptive framework MPI-AMRVAC, which is a general toolkit for especially hyperbolic/parabolic partial differential equations (PDEs). Applications traditionally focused on shock-dominated, magnetized plasma dynamics described by either Newtonian or special relativistic (magneto)hydrodynamics, but its versatile design easily extends to different PDE systems. Here, we demonstrate applications covering any-dimensional scalar to system PDEs, with e.g. Korteweg--de Vries solutions generalizing early findings on soliton behavior, shallow water applications in round or square pools, hydrodynamic convergence tests as well as challenging computational fluid and plasma dynamics applications. The recent addition of a parallel multigrid solver opens up new avenues where also elliptic constraints or stiff source terms play a central role. This is illustrated here by solving several multi-dimensional reaction--diffusion-type equations. We document the minimal requirements for adding a new physics module governed by any nonlinear PDE system, such that it can directly benefit from the code flexibility in combining various temporal and spatial discretization schemes. Distributed through GitHub, MPI-AMRVAC can be used to perform 1D, 1.5D, 2D, 2.5D or 3D simulations in Cartesian, cylindrical or spherical coordinate systems, using parallel domain-decomposition, or exploiting fully dynamic block quadtree-octree grids.},
