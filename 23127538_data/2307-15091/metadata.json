  "abstract": "Photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are a central component of neutrino telescopes such as IceCube and KM3NeT, and an accurate understanding and measurement of their properties is indispensable for improvements of these experiments. In this contribution we focus on a detailed investigation of the photocathode and the dynode system and their influence on the performance of the PMT. Three methods are used for the investigation. Ellipsometry measurements of the photocathode analyze its optical properties in terms of absorption probability and refractive index. Scans of the photocathode in single photon illumination probe performance differences along the photocathode surface. Systematic deviations in the resulting amplifications are compared to electric field and electron tracing simulations through the dynode system to understand the measured values. The goal is an extensive understanding of efficiency, amplification, and timing as functions of wavelength and impact point as well as angle.",
