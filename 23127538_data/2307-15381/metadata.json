  "abstract": "We propose AffineGlue, a method for joint two-view feature matching and robust estimation that reduces the combinatorial complexity of the problem by employing single-point minimal solvers. AffineGlue selects potential matches from one-to-many correspondences to estimate minimal models. Guided matching is then used to find matches consistent with the model, suffering less from the ambiguities of one-to-one matches. Moreover, we derive a new minimal solver for homography estimation, requiring only a single affine correspondence (AC) and a gravity prior. Furthermore, we train a neural network to reject ACs that are unlikely to lead to a good model. AffineGlue is superior to the SOTA on real-world datasets, even when assuming that the gravity direction points downwards. On PhotoTourism, the AUC@10° score is improved by 6.6 points compared to the SOTA. On ScanNet, AffineGlue makes SuperPoint and SuperGlue achieve similar accuracy as the detector-free LoFTR.",
