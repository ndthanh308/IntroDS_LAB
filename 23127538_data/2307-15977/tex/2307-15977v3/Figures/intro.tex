    % \caption{Illustration of the existing model attribution method (above) and our method (below). Existing methods depend on training with a limited set of real-world models, which allows them to attribute seen classical models included in the training data. However, they struggle to distinguish emerging unseen models like Stable Diffusion (SD) and DALL-E due to a gap in fingerprint distribution (top-right part). In contrast, our method trains on numerous synthetic models that replicate a broader range of real-world generative model fingerprints, enabling it to attribute unseen models effectively in a zero-shot manner (bottom-right part).}
