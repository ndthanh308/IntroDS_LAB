\caption{Differences between our method and related works. Our method enables zero-shot model attribution, allowing us to attribute unseen models without needing training samples from them. In contrast, other methods can only attribute seen models that were included in training.}

\cite{marra2019gans,yu2019attributing,yang2022aaai,bui2022repmix} & Closed-set attribution & Real-world models & $<$ 50 & Attribute seen models \\
