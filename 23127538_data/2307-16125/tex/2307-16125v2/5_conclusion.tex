\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we propose a large-scale benchmark SEED-Bench to provide a comprehensive and objective evaluation of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) on generative comprehension. SEED-Bench consists of 19K multiple-choice questions with accurate human annotations, which covers 12 evaluation dimensions for both the spatial and temporal understanding. We design an advanced pipeline to create multiple-choice questions that target specific evaluation dimensions, facilitating the scalability of evaluation data across a variety of domains. We also integrate automatic filtering and manual verification to improve the quality of the generated questions and answers. We conduct a thorough evaluation of 18 models, analyzing and comparing their performances to provide insights for future research. We plan to launch and consistently maintain a leaderboard, offering a platform for the community to assess model performance. We will continue to further broadening the evaluation dimensions of SEED-Bench with more data.
