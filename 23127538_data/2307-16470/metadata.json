  "abstract": "The seesaw mechanism is the most attractive mechanism to explain the small neutrino masses, which predicts the neutrinoless double beta decay ($0νββ$) of the nucleus. Thus the discovery of $0νββ$ is extremely important for future particle physics. However, the present data on the neutrino oscillation is not sufficient to predict the value of $m_{ee}$ as well as the neutrino mass $m_ν^i$. In this short article, by adopting a simple and consistent Froggatt-Nielsen model, which can well explain the observed masses and mixing angles of quark and lepton sectors, we calculate the distribution of $m_{ee}$ and $m_ν^i$. Interestingly, a relatively large part of the preferred parameter space can be detected in the near future.",
