	abstract = {The longitudinal shape, i.e., the current profile, of an electron bunch determines the transformer ratio in a collinear wakefield accelerator and thus methods are sought to control the longitudinal bunch shape. The emittance exchange (EEX) appears to be promising for creating a precisely controlled longitudinal bunch shapes. The longitudinal shape is perturbed by two sources: higher-order terms in the beam line optics and collective effects and these perturbations can lead to a significant drop of the transformer ratio. In this paper, we analytically and numerically investigate the perturbation to an ideal triangular longitudinal bunch shape and propose methods to minimize it.},

	abstract = {An electron beam experiences chromatic emittance growth in a plasma-based accelerator if it is not matched to the focusing force in the plasma wake. A ramped plasma density profile at the entrance and exit of the plasma source can control the focusing of the beam into and out of the plasma accelerator, limiting emittance growth. Here, we present a comprehensive, analytic theory to describe the transverse beam dynamics and emittance growth in a nearly arbitrary plasma ramp profile. For a given incoming beam, this theory can be used to determine the length of the ramp required to correctly focus the electron beam, the optimal location of the beam's vacuum focus, and the chromatic emittance growth in the ramp. In addition, the theory can be used to determine the effect that errors in the beam focusing and plasma profile have on the emittance of the beam. We illustrate two example ramps to demonstrate the theory: one that provides very fast focusing for beam matching, and one that is robust to errors in the plasma density profile. © 2019 authors.

It is shown, by analytical solutions of the fully relativistic nonlinear fluid equations in one dimension, that under certain conditions on the relative densities of the electron beam and the plasma, extremely large longitudinal electric fields can be generated in the wake of the beam. This scheme can be considered as a nonlinear regime of the plasma wakefield accelerator (PWFA), and is seen to have the advantage that the transformer ratio, the ratio of the maximum amplitude of the accelerating field behind the driving beam over the maximum amplitude of the decelerating field inside of the beam, can be made arbitrarily large, dependent only on the length of the driving beam. The effects of beam loading on the efficiency of this scheme are considered, and are shown to be equivalent to those predicted in the linear regime.},

This plays an important role in the collinear wakefield acceleration scheme. A high transformer ratio is desirable since it leads to a higher overall efficiency under similar conditions (e.g. the same beam loading, the same structure, etc.). One technique to enhance the transformer ratio beyond the ordinary limit of 2 is to use a ramped bunch train. The first experimental demonstration observed a transformer ratio only marginally above 2 due to the mismatch between the drive microbunch length and the frequency of the accelerating structure [C. Jing, A. Kanareykin, J. Power, M. Conde, Z. Yusof, P. Schoessow, and W. Gai, Phys. Rev. Lett. 98, 144801 (2007)]. Recently, we revisited this experiment with an optimized microbunch length using a UV laser stacking technique at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator facility and measured a transformer ratio of 3.4. Measurements and data analysis from these experiments are presented in detail.},

Interactions of radially neighboring bunches are also present, but their combined effects have not yet been investigated in any great detail. In this paper, a new particle in the cell-based self-consistent numerical simulation model is presented for the first time. The model covers neighboring bunch effects and is implemented in the three-dimensional object-oriented parallel code OPAL-cycl, a flavor of the OPAL framework. We discuss this model together with its implementation and validation.

The mask shapes the bunch’s horizontal profile, and the EEX beam line converts it to a corresponding longitudinal profile. The Argonne wakefield accelerator rf photoinjector delivers electron bunches into a LBS beam line to generate a variety of longitudinal bunch shapes. The quality of the longitudinal bunch shape is limited by various perturbations in the exchange process.

Electron beam driven experiments have measured the integrated and dynamic aspects of plasma focusing, the bright flux of high-energy betatron radiation photons, particle beam refraction at the plasma/neutral gas interface, and the structure and amplitude of the accelerating wakefield. Gradients spanning kT/m to MT/m for focusing and 100 MeV/m to 50 GeV/m for acceleration have been excited in plasmas with densities of 1014 to 1017 cm−3, respectively. The large accelerating gradient led to the energy doubling of 42 GeV electrons in only 85 cm of plasma. Positron beam driven experiments have evidenced the comparatively more complex dynamic and integrated plasma focusing, the subsequent halo formation and emittance growth in the positron beam and demonstrated accelerating gradients of nearly 100 MeV/m. This article summarizes this experimental progress, illustrates the key enabling technologies that made the work possible, concludes with a brief discussion of proposed future directions, and suggests that the PWFA could one day revolutionize e−/e+ linear colliders.

Résumé
Les expériences d'ondes de sillage excitées par faisceaux de particules (PWFA en anglais) ont faits de remarquables progrès durant ces dix dernières années grâce à l'usage de faisceaux de particules de haute énergie pour exciter l'onde. Dans les expériences utilisant des faisceaux d'électrons, la dynamique de la focalisation du faisceau, le flux de photons produit par les oscillations bétatron, la réfraction des particules à l'interface entre le plasma et le gaz neutre, ainsi que la stucture et l'amplitude du champs accélérateur ont été mesurés. Des gradients de champs focalisatieurs du kT/m au MT/m, et des gradients accélérateurs de 100 MeV/m à 50 GeV/m on été excités dans des plasma avec des densités de 1014 à 1017 cm−3, respectivement. La grande amplitude du gradient accélérateur a permis de doubler l'énergie des électrons de 42 GeV sur une longueur de seulement 85 cm de plasma. Les expériences avec des faisceaux de positrons ont mis en évidence le coté plus complexe de la dynamique de focalisation des positrons par le plasma, la formation d'un halo de charge autour du faisceau ainsi que la croissance de l'émittance du faisceau qui en découlent, et ont démontré l'excitation de gradients accélérateurs de presque 100 MeV/m. Cette revue résume ces progrès expérimentaux, illustre les technologies clés qui ont permis ces progrès, et se termine par une brève discussion des directions dans lesquelles ces recherches pourraient se diriger dans le futur. Elle suggère également qu'un jour le PWFA pourrait révolutioner le monde des accélérateurs linéaires e−/e+. Pour citer cet article : P. Muggli, M.J. Hogan, C. R. Physique 10 (2009).},

	abstract = {This chapter provides an overview of hollow cathode arcs (HCA). Hollow cathodes have been used for some years in different discharge devices, working under varying conditions in widely extended ranges. All of these devices have one common feature: the cathode presents a hollow cavity, enclosed or at least partially bound by walls made of conducting refractory materials kept at the cathode potential. The geometry of such cathodes is such that their open side faces the anode side of the discharge, so that the plasma existing at the interelectrode space can penetrate the hollow cathode, thus assuring a strong interaction between the plasma and the cathode internal surface. In general terms, this interaction affects an extensive area of the cathode wall; a positive space-charge sheath builds up, so that the incoming ions are strongly accelerated before neutralization upon the wall. In this chapter, historical review of HCA is presented. Working regimes of HCA are elaborated. Operating conditions for low-pressure HCA are described. Experimental results for the normal regime are presented. Theory of HCA in the N regime is also discussed.},

Knowledge of wakefields is required for many applications ranging from the suppression of wakefields that arise from geometrical discontinuities to the enhancement of wakefields in structure and plasma based wakefield accelerators. In the past, direct measurements of wakefields were done with the drive-witness technique wherein the delay of a short witness beam trailing collinearly behind a high-charge drive beam is scanned over multiple shots and the wakefield is inferred from the energy spectrum of the witness beam. That technique is limited by shot-to-shot jitter, overlap of the drive and witness energy spectrum and the loss of all time-domain information. In this paper, we describe a new technique that overcomes these limitations by measuring the longitudinal phase space of a long witness beam and the drive beam in a single shot. We conclude by presenting experimental results to demonstrate its feasibility using a dielectric structure wakefield accelerator.},

These methods have dramatically improved the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual object recognition, object detection and many other domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep learning discovers intricate structure in large data sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to indicate how a machine should change its internal parameters that are used to compute the representation in each layer from the representation in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have brought about breakthroughs in processing images, video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have shone light on sequential data such as text and speech.},

Our approach consists of training a ML-based virtual diagnostic to predict the LPS using only nondestructive linac and e-beam measurements as inputs. We validate this approach with a simulation study for the FACET-II linac and with an experimental demonstration conducted at LCLS. At LCLS, the e-beam LPS images are obtained with a transverse deflecting cavity and used as training data for our ML model. In both the FACET-II and LCLS cases we find good agreement between the predicted and simulated/measured LPS profiles, an important step towards showing the feasibility of implementing such a virtual diagnostic on particle accelerators in the future.},

The construction of such systems involves many distributed design choices. The end products (e.g., recommendation systems, medical analysis tools, real-time game engines, speech recognizers) thus involve many tunable configuration parameters. These parameters are often specified and hard-coded into the software by various developers or teams. If optimized jointly, these parameters can result in significant improvements. Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for the joint optimization of design choices that is gaining great popularity in recent years. It promises greater automation so as to increase both product quality and human productivity. This review paper introduces Bayesian optimization, highlights some of its methodological aspects, and showcases a wide range of applications.},

Starting from the Bayes’ theorem, a complete linear optics model is simplified as “likelihood functions” and “prior probability distributions.” Under some assumptions, the least square algorithm and then the Jacobian matrix approach can be rederived. The coherence of the correction algorithm is ensured through specifying a self-consistent regularization coefficient to prevent overfitting. Optimal weights for different correction objectives are obtained based on their measurement noise level. A new technique has been developed to resolve degenerated quadrupole errors when observed at a few select beam position monitors (BPMs). A necessary condition of being distinguishable is that their optics response vectors seen at these specific BPMs should be near orthogonal.},

	abstract = {With the aid of machine learning techniques, the genetic algorithm has been enhanced and applied to the multi-objective optimization problem presented by the dynamic aperture of the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) Storage Ring. During the evolution processes employed by the genetic algorithm, the population is classified into different clusters in the search space. The clusters with top average fitness are given “elite” status. Intervention on the population is implemented by repopulating some potentially competitive candidates based on the experience learned from the accumulated data. These candidates replace randomly selected candidates among the original data pool. The average fitness of the population is therefore improved while diversity is not lost. Maintaining diversity ensures that the optimization is global rather than local. The quality of the population increases and produces more competitive descendants accelerating the evolution process significantly. When identifying the distribution of optimal candidates, they appear to be located in isolated islands within the search space. Some of these optimal candidates have been experimentally confirmed at the NSLS-II storage ring. The machine learning techniques that exploit the genetic algorithm can also be used in other population-based optimization problems such as particle swarm algorithm.},

This interaction may cause a distortion of the measured profile shape despite strong external magnetic field applied to impose limits on the transverse movement of electrons. The mechanisms leading to this distortion are discussed in detail. The distortion itself is described by means of analytic calculations for simplified beam distributions and a full simulation model for realistic distributions. Simple relation for minimum magnetic field scaling with beam parameters for avoiding profile distortions is presented. Further, application of machine learning algorithms to the problem of reconstructing the actual beam profile from distorted measured profile is presented. The obtained results show good agreement for tests on simulation data. The performance of these algorithms indicate that they could be very useful for operations of IPMs on high brightness beams or IPMs with weak magnetic field.},

Its high-intensity electron beam, 3400 A in peak current and 46 TW in peak power, is concentrated in a small area (37 micrometer in rms radius) inside its undulator. Ten optical transition radiation (OTR) imagers are planned between the undulator segments for characterizing the transverse profiles of the electron beam. In this note, we report on the optical and mechanical design of the OTR imager. Through a unique optical arrangement, using a near-normal-incidence screen and a multi-layer coated mirror, this imager will achieve a fine resolution (12 micrometer or better) over the entire field of view (8 mm × 5 mm), with a high efficiency for single-shot imaging. A digital camera will be used to read out the beam images in a programmable region (5 mm × 0.5 mm) at the full beam repetition rate (120 Hz), or over the entire field at a lower rate (10 Hz). Its built-in programmable amplifier will be used as an electronic intensity control.},

	abstract = {The fourth generation of light sources (such as LCLS and the XFEL) require high energy electron drivers (1520GeV) of very high quality.We are exploring the possibility of using a high transformer ratio PWFA to meet their challenging requirements. This may have the potential to reduce the size of the electron drivers by a factor of 5 or more, therefore making these light sources much smaller and more affordable. In our proposed design, a high charge (5-10nC) low energy driver (1-3GeV) with an elongated current proﬁle is used to drive a plasma wake in the relativistic blowout regime[1] with a high transformer ratio (5 or more). A second ultra-short beam that has high quality and lower charge ( 1nC) can be loaded into the wake at a proper phase and be accelerated to high energy (5-15GeV) in very short distances (10s of cms). The parameters can be optimized, such that high quality (0.1 percent energy spread and 1mm mrad normalized emittance) and high efﬁciency (60-80 percent) can be simultaneously achieved. In this paper, we will present some preliminary theoretical analysis and PIC simulations of this concept.},

	abstract = {A wakefield accelerator uses a medium capable of sustaining appropriate electric fields to transfer energy from a drive beam to a witness beam. Examples of such systems include electron beam driven plasma wakefields, laser driven plasma wakefields and electron beam driven dielectric wakefield structures. Dielectrics and plasmas are of particular interest because they are capable of maintaining electric fields on the order of GV/m and in the case of plasmas upwards of TV/m. These systems provide a significant step beyond current radiofrequency accelerating structures capable of peak electric fields on the order of 100 MV/m and average effective electric fields of 20 MV/m. Furthermore, beam driven dielectric structures produce a wakefield which is phase synchronous with the beam, these structures do not suffer from transit time or dephasing effects. In the case of dielectric wakefield accelerators, the structures under study in this publication, the modes generated by the driving beam are in the terahertz (THz) regime. Thus development of dielectric wakefield accelerators is seen as a path to smaller, more compact accelerating systems and as a means to generate THz radiation. Here we demonstrate a beam-driven dielectric wakefield accelerating structure that produces sustained fields of 1.35 GV/m for many hundreds of thousands of drive beam pulses. In addition we show beam-driven dielectric structures have the potential to produce single mode, high spectral purity THZ radiation of unprecedented energy scale.},

The so called Trojan Horse underdense photocathode plasma wakefield acceleration scheme combines state-ofthe-art accelerator technology with laser and plasma methods and paves the way to improve beam quality as regards emittance and energy spread by many orders of magnitude. Electron beam brightness levels exceeding 1020 Am-2 rad-2 may be reached, and the tunability allows for multi-GeV energies, designer bunches and energy spreads {\textless}0.05\% in a single plasma accelerator stage. The talk will present results of the international E210 multiyear experimental program at SLAC FACET, which culminated in successful first demonstration of the Trojan Horse method during FACET’s final experimental run in 2016. Enabling implications for applications, including high performance plasma-based 5th generation light sources such as hard x-ray FEL’s, for which preliminary start-to-end simulations are presented, and for high energy physics are discussed.},

High energy (500 mJ), short (50 fs) pulses of 800 nm laser light at 1 Hz are used at the FACET experimental area to produce a plasma column. The laser pulses are stretched to 250 fs before injection into a vapor cell, where the laser is focused by an axicon lens to form a plasma column that can be sustained over the desired radius and length. A 20 GeV electron bunch interacts with this preformed plasma to generate a non-linear wakefield, thus accelerating a trailing witness bunch with gradients on the order of several GV m−1. The experimental setup and the methods for producing the pre-ionized plasma for plasma wakefield acceleration experiments performed at FACET are described.},

This scheme foresees the use of very low charge beams, which may allow existing FEL injectors to produce few-100 as pulses, with very high brightness. Towards this end, recent experiments at SLAC have produced \$ 2 fs rms, low transverse emittance, 20 pC electron pulses. Here we examine the use of such pulses to excite plasma wakeﬁelds exceeding 1 TV/m, permitting a table-top TeV accelerator. We present a scheme for focusing the beam to very small dimensions, where the surface Coulomb ﬁelds are also at the TV/m level. These conditions access a new regime for high ﬁeld for atomic physics, allowing frontier atomic physics experiments such as barrier suppression regime ionization. They also, critically, permit well-sub-fs plasma formation for subsequent wake excitation. We examine the use of such ultra-short beams for creating coherent sub-cycle IR radiation at unprecedented high power levels.},

	abstract = {In the limit of a small Debye length ( lambda D to 0) the analysis of the plasma boundary layer leads to a two-scale problem of a collision free sheath and of a quasi-neutral presheath. Bohm's criterion expresses a necessary condition for the formation of a stationary sheath in front of a negative absorbing wall. The basic features of the plasma-sheath transition and their relation to the Bohm criterion are discussed and illustrated from a simple cold-ion fluid model. A rigorous kinetic analysis of the vicinity of the sheath edge allows one to generalize Bohm's criterion accounting not only for arbitrary ion and electron distributions, but also for general boundary conditions at the wall. It is shown that the generalized sheath condition is (apart from special exceptions) marginally fulfilled and related to a sheath edge field singularity.

We also discuss various technical realizations of plasma sources for selected applications. This paper is further limited to the discussion of plasma generation methods that employ electric ﬁelds. The various plasmas described include dc glow discharges, either operated continuously (CW) or pulsed, capacitively and inductively coupled rf discharges, helicon discharges, and microwave discharges. Various examples of technical realizations of plasmas in closed structures (cavities), in open structures (surfatron, planar plasma source), and in magnetic ﬁelds (electron cyclotron resonance sources) are discussed in detail. Finally, we mention dielectric barrier discharges as convenient sources of non-thermal plasmas at high pressures (up to atmospheric pressure) and beam-produced plasmas. It is the main objective of this paper to give an overview of the wide range of diverse plasma generation methods and plasma sources and highlight the broad spectrum of plasma properties which, in turn, lead to a wide range of diverse technological and technical applications.},

Die experimentelle Untersuchung dieser Zeiten in Abhängigkeit von Pausendauer zwischen zwei Entladungen, Einstrahlung, Temperatur und Überspannung ergibt, daß es sich hier um die Aufbauzeiten der Entladung selbst handelt. Die theoretische Untersuchung fordert, daß der zeitliche Verlauf des Entladungsaufbaues im wesentlichen raumladungsfrei vor sich geht. Die aus der Townsendschen Theorie gewonnenen Ausdrücke für die Abhängigkeit der Aufbauzeit von Primärstromstärke und Überspannung werden experimentell bestätigt. Diese Gleichungen beschreiben gleichzeitig den zeitlichen Verlauf des Aufbaues des gasverstärkten Photostromes.},

Results show order-of-magnitude transverse emittance growth during the injection process, if the electron bunch is not matched to its intrinsic betatron motion inside the wakefield. This behavior is supported by analytic theory reproducing the simulation data to a percent level. The length over which the full emittance growth develops is found to be less than or comparable to the typical dimension of a single plasma module in current multistage designs. In addition, the analytic theory enables the quantitative prediction of emittance degradation in two consecutive accelerators coupled by free-drift sections, excluding this as a scheme for effective emittance-growth suppression, and thus suggests the necessity of beam-matching sections between acceleration stages with fundamental implications on the overall design of staged laser-wakefield accelerators.},

	abstract = {Particle accelerators are host to myriad nonlinear and complex physical phenomena. They often involve a multitude of interacting systems, are subject to tight performance demands, and should be able to run for extended periods of time with minimal interruptions. Often times, traditional control techniques cannot fully meet these requirements. One promising avenue is to introduce machine learning and sophisticated control techniques inspired by artificial intelligence, particularly in light of recent theoretical and practical advances in these fields. Within machine learning and artificial intelligence, neural networks are particularly well-suited to modeling, control, and diagnostic analysis of complex, nonlinear, and time-varying systems, as well as systems with large parameter spaces. Consequently, the use of neural network-based modeling and control techniques could be of significant benefit to particle accelerators. For the same reasons, particle accelerators are also ideal test-beds for these techniques. Many early attempts to apply neural networks to particle accelerators yielded mixed results due to the relative immaturity of the technology for such tasks. The purpose of this paper is to re-introduce neural networks to the particle accelerator community and report on some work in neural network control that is being conducted as part of a dedicated collaboration between Fermilab and Colorado State University (CSU). We describe some of the challenges of particle accelerator control, highlight recent advances in neural network techniques, discuss some promising avenues for incorporating neural networks into particle accelerator control systems, and describe a neural network-based control system that is being developed for resonance control of an RF electron gun at the Fermilab Accelerator Science and Technology (FAST) facility, including initial experimental results from a benchmark controller.},

	abstract = {The transformer ratio, characterizing the ratio of maximum accelerating field behind the drive bunch to the maximum decelerating field inside the drive bunch, is one of the key parameters for characterizing the performance of collinear wakefield accelerators. In this paper the use of electron drive bunches possessing a particular temporal profile (the double-triangular bunch) is shown to significantly increase the transformer ratio beyond 2, the limit for a symmetric bunch. The double-triangular bunch is generated using the emittance exchange technique [P. Emma et al., Phys. Rev. ST Accel. Beams 9, 100702 (2006)]. Complete beam simulations have been performed for a collinear wakefield acceleration experiment planned at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator facility including the effects of the physical emittance increase of the bunch in the wakefield device. A transformer ratio of 6.5 and gradient of 20 MV/m is expected in this proof-of-principle experiment for a 3 nC double-triangular bunch traversing a 10 cm long, 200 GHz quartz based dielectric wakefield accelerator structure.},

The drastic differences of the transverse focusing strengths as the beam propagates between stages and components may lead to a catastrophic emittance growth even when there is a small energy spread. We propose using the linear focusing forces from nonlinear wakes in longitudinally tailored plasma density profiles to control phase space matching between sections with negligible emittance growth. Several profiles are considered and theoretical analysis and particle-in-cell simulations show how these structures may work in four different scenarios. Good agreement between theory and simulation is obtained, and it is found that the adiabatic approximation misses important physics even for long profiles.},

	abstract = {An important aspect of plasma wake field accelerators (PWFA) is stable propagation of the drive beam. In the under dense plasma regime, the drive beam creates an ion channel which acts on the beam as a strong thick focusing lens. The ion channel causes the beam to undergo multiple betatron oscillations along the length of the plasma. There are several advantages if the beam size can be matched to a constant radius. First, simulations have shown that instabilities such as hosing are reduced when the beam is matched [1]. Second, synchrotron radiation losses are minimized when the beam is matched. Third, an initially matched beam will propagate with no significant change in beam size in spite of large energy loss or gain. Coupling to the plasma with a matched radius can be difficult in some cases. This paper shows how an appropriate density ramp at the plasma entrance can be useful for achieving a matched beam. Additionally, the density ramp is helpful in bringing a misaligned trailing beam onto the drive beam axis. A plasma source with boundary profiles useful for matching has been created for the E-164X PWFA experiments at SLAC.},

Noting that beams from an rf photocathode gun can have energy spread much smaller than required for efficient FEL interaction, we present a method to produce normalized transverse emittance at or below about 0.1 μm, which will lead to a significantly shorter length undulator as well as a lower electron beam energy for an x-ray FEL project. The beam manipulation consists of producing an unequal partition of the initially equal emittances into two dissimilar emittances by a flat-beam technique and exchanging the larger transverse emittance with a smaller longitudinal emittance. We study various issues involved in the manipulation. In particular, a new emittance exchange optics we found enables an exact emittance exchange necessary for this scheme.},

	abstract = {High-efficiency acceleration of charged particle beams at high gradients of energy gain per unit length is necessary to achieve an affordable and compact high-energy collider. The plasma wakefield accelerator is one concept1,2,3 being developed for this purpose. In plasma wakefield acceleration, a charge-density wake with high accelerating fields is driven by the passage of an ultra-relativistic bunch of charged particles (the drive bunch) through a plasma4,5,6. If a second bunch of relativistic electrons (the trailing bunch) with sufficient charge follows in the wake of the drive bunch at an appropriate distance, it can be efficiently accelerated to high energy. Previous experiments using just a single 42-gigaelectronvolt drive bunch have accelerated electrons with a continuous energy spectrum and a maximum energy of up to 85 gigaelectronvolts from the tail of the same bunch in less than a metre of plasma7. However, the total charge of these accelerated electrons was insufficient to extract a substantial amount of energy from the wake. Here we report high-efficiency acceleration of a discrete trailing bunch of electrons that contains sufficient charge to extract a substantial amount of energy from the high-gradient, nonlinear plasma wakefield accelerator. Specifically, we show the acceleration of about 74 picocoulombs of charge contained in the core of the trailing bunch in an accelerating gradient of about 4.4 gigavolts per metre. These core particles gain about 1.6 gigaelectronvolts of energy per particle, with a final energy spread as low as 0.7 per cent (2.0 per cent on average), and an energy-transfer efficiency from the wake to the bunch that can exceed 30 per cent (17.7 per cent on average). This acceleration of a distinct bunch of electrons containing a substantial charge and having a small energy spread with both a high accelerating gradient and a high energy-transfer efficiency represents a milestone in the development of plasma wakefield acceleration into a compact and affordable accelerator technology.},

	abstract = {We give an overview of the research program at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator Facility (AWA), including some highlights of recent experiments. The AWA facility is dedicated to the study of beam physics and the development of technology for future particle accelerators. Two independent electron linacs are used to study wakefield acceleration: 70 MeV high charge electron bunches of up to 100 nC are used to drive wakefields, which can be probed by bunches originating from the same linac or from the 15 MeV linac. Recent Two-BeamAcceleration (TBA) experiments reached accelerating gradients of up to 150 MV/m. The wakefields were generated by the passage of the 15 – 45 nC drive bunches through iris-loaded metallic structures operating at 11.7 GHz. No indication of witness beam quality degradation was observed, and bunch charge was preserved during the acceleration process. Another series of experiments was conducted using two TBA stages, demonstrating acceleration of the witness beam in these two subsequent stages by means of two independent drive bunch trains. Dielectric loaded structures operating at 26 GHz are also used in TBA experiments. Another main thrust of the research program consists of exploring and developing techniques to manipulate the phase space of electron bunches. These efforts include bunch shaping and the exchange of emittances in the transverse and the longitudinal phase spaces.},

	abstract = {An externally heated, hollow cathode arc source was recommissioned at UCLA for use in experiments to drive plasma wakefields with shaped beams at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator. The hollow cathode arc source provides a robust plasma column with a density in the     10 13    \&ndash;    10 14     cm      \&minus; 3      range while external heating of the cathode allows the plasma arc regime to be accessed with applied voltages down to 20 V. Overall source operating principals are described, along with time-resolved plasma current measurements and plasma density characterization with the use of a triple Langumir probe. The results show that relevant plasma densities that match facility beam parameters are readily achievable.},

	abstract = {The energy frontier of particle physics is several trillion electron volts, but colliders capable of reaching this regime (such as the Large Hadron Collider and the International Linear Collider) are costly and time-consuming to build; it is therefore important to explore new methods of accelerating particles to high energies. Plasma-based accelerators are particularly attractive because they are capable of producing accelerating fields that are orders of magnitude larger than those used in conventional colliders1,2,3. In these accelerators, a drive beam (either laser or particle) produces a plasma wave (wakefield) that accelerates charged particles4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11. The ultimate utility of plasma accelerators will depend on sustaining ultrahigh accelerating fields over a substantial length to achieve a significant energy gain. Here we show that an energy gain of more than 42 GeV is achieved in a plasma wakefield accelerator of 85 cm length, driven by a 42 GeV electron beam at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). The results are in excellent agreement with the predictions of three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Most of the beam electrons lose energy to the plasma wave, but some electrons in the back of the same beam pulse are accelerated with a field of ∼52 GV m-1. This effectively doubles their energy, producing the energy gain of the 3-km-long SLAC accelerator in less than a metre for a small fraction of the electrons in the injected bunch. This is an important step towards demonstrating the viability of plasma accelerators for high-energy physics applications.},

This paper reports the results of beam emittance and momentum measurements.

In particular, for 10 nC bunches, the mean beam momentum decreased by about 5\% while the rms momentum spread increased from 2\% to 8\%.

The plasma was created in a long, narrow discharge tube and then expanded downstream of the radiofrequency (RF) antenna into a large chamber. Fast camera images of the expanding plasma revealed a multi-phase time-dependent emission pattern that did not follow the ion density distribution. Dramatic differences in visible brightness were observed between discharges with and without an externally applied magnetic field. These phenomena were studied by tracking excited state populations using passive emission spectroscopy and are discussed in terms of the distinction between ionizing and recombining phase plasmas. Additionally, a method is presented for inferring the unknown neutral gas pressure in the discharge tube from the time-dependent visible and infrared emission measured by a simple photodiode placed near the antenna.

	abstract = {Plasma wakefield acceleration is the most promising acceleration technique known nowadays, able to provide very high accelerating fields (10–100GV/m), enabling acceleration of electrons to GeV energy in few centimeter. However, the quality of the electron bunches accelerated with this technique is still not comparable with that of conventional accelerators (large energy spread, low repetition rate, and large emittance); radiofrequency-based accelerators, in fact, are limited in accelerating field (10–100MV/m) requiring therefore hundred of meters of distances to reach the GeV energies, but can provide very bright electron bunches. To combine high brightness electron bunches from conventional accelerators and high accelerating fields reachable with plasmas could be a good compromise allowing to further accelerate high brightness electron bunches coming from LINAC while preserving electron beam quality. Following the idea of plasma wave resonant excitation driven by a train of short bunches, we have started to study the requirements in terms of plasma for SPARC\_LAB (Ferrario et al., 2013 [1]).

	abstract = {Dense relativistic electron beams traversing a plasma, in what is known as the underdense, or ion focusing, regime experience a strong, linear transverse restoring force. This force arises from the nearly immobile ions which form a channel of uncompensated positive charge when the plasma electrons are ejected in response to the introduction of the beam charge. This phenomenon can be used for focusing the electron beam to very high densities over long propagation distances. Several schemes have been proposed, including the nonlinear plasma wake-field accelerator, the adiabatic plasma lens, and the ion-channel laser, whose viability is based on this focusing effect for very short pulse, high current electron beams propagating in plasma. In this paper we examine, analytically and numerically, the self-consistent requirements on plasma density, beam current, length, and transverse emittance which must be satisfied in order for ion-channel formation and near equilibrium beam propagation to exist over the majority of the length of the electron beam. The dynamics of the beam-plasma system are modeled by a simultaneous solution of the plasma electron cold-fluid equations, and the Maxwell-Vlasov equation governing the beam’s thermal equilibrium. The effects of introducing a strong axial magnetic field on the plasma response and beam equilibria are examined. In addition to developing criteria for self-consistent equilibrium focusing, a time-dependent analysis where the beam particles are treated as mobile particles in cells is developed in order to study the dynamical approach of this equilibrium. Inherently time-dependent phenomena, such as matching of the beam into the plasma and adiabatic lenses, are then examined with this method.},

	abstract = {Initial experiments which have explored the physics of the underdense (blowout) regime of the plasma wakefield accelerator (PWFA) at the Argonne Wakefield Accelerator facility are reported. In this regime, the relativistic electron beam is denser than the plasma, causing the beam channel to completely rarefy, and leaving a high quality accelerating region which also contains a uniform ion column. This ion column in turn allows the drive and accelerating beams to be well guided over many initial beam beta-function lengths. The results of these experiments, which have taken place over several years, are reviewed. Notable achievements in the course of these studies include the creation and measurement of drive and witness beam generated in an rf photoinjector, as well as previously published studies on drive beam guiding in the underdense regime. In addition, these experiments allowed measurement of both beam energy loss and gain, at a maximum average rate of 25 MeV/m in this regime of the PWFA, which is consistent with a peak acceleration gradient of 62 MeV/m in the excited waves. Difficulties associated with this type of experiment are discussed, as are prospects for mitigating these difficulties and achieving high gradient acceleration in planned future experiments.},

	abstract = {A nonlinear kinetic theory for multidimensional plasma wave wakes with phase velocities near the speed of light is presented. This theory is appropriate for describing plasma wakes excited in the so-called blowout regime by either electron beams or laser pulses where the plasma electrons move predominantly in the transverse direction. The theory assumes that all electrons within a blowout radius are completely expelled. These radially expelled electrons form a narrow sheath just beyond the blowout radius which is surrounded by a region which responds weakly (linearly). This assumption is reasonable when the spot size of the electron beam and laser are substantially less than the blowout radius. By using this theory one can predict the wakefield amplitudes and blowout radius in terms of the electron beam or laser beam parameters, as well as predict the nonlinear modifications to the wake’s wavelength and wave form. For the laser case, the laser spot size must also be properly matched in order for a narrow sheath to form. The requirements for forming a spherical wave form, i.e., “bubble,” are also discussed. The theory is also used to show when linear fluid theory breaks down and how this leads to a saturation of the logarithmic divergence in the linear Green’s function.},

For larger amplitudes it is found that multistream flow or fine-scale mixing sets in on the first oscillation. Oscillations with spherical or cylindrical symmetry develop multistream flow almost always, independent of the amplitude. The time required for mixing to start is inversely proportional to the square of the amplitude. Plane oscillations in a nonuniform plasma are also found to exhibit this type of behavior. Some considerations are also given to more general oscillations and a calculation is presented which indicates that multistream flow will usually set in.},

In this Letter, we present the measurement of ratios of acceleration of the witness bunch to deceleration of the driver bunch, the so-called transformer ratio, significantly exceeding the fundamental theoretical and thus far experimental limit of 2 in a PWFA. An electron bunch with ramped current profile was utilized to accelerate a witness bunch with a transformer ratio of 4.6+2.2−0.7 in a plasma with length ∼10 cm, also demonstrating stable transport of driver bunches with lengths on the order of the plasma wavelength.},

It works very well for the first bucket before phase mixing occurs. We separate the plasma response into a cavity or blowout region void of all electrons and a sheath of electrons just beyond the cavity. This simple model permits the derivation of a single equation for the boundary of the cavity. It works particularly well for narrow electron bunches and for short lasers with spot sizes matched to the radius of the cavity. It is also used to describe the structure of both the accelerating and focusing fields in the wake.},

Recent experimental evidence of the use of sextupoles to manipulate second-order horizontal and longitudinal dispersion of the beam is presented. The theoretical and experimental results indicate that these manipulations can be used to create an electron bunch with a current profile having a long ramp followed by a sharp cutoff, which is optimal for driving large-amplitude wake fields in a plasma wake field accelerator.},

In order to scale the method and keep its benefits, we propose an algorithm (LineBO) that restricts the problem to a sequence of iteratively chosen one-dimensional sub-problems that can be solved efficiently. We show that our algorithm converges globally and obtains a fast local rate when the function is strongly convex. Further, if the objective has an invariant subspace, our method automatically adapts to the effective dimension without changing the algorithm. When combined with the SafeOpt algorithm to solve the sub-problems, we obtain the first safe Bayesian optimization algorithm with theoretical guarantees applicable in high-dimensional settings. We evaluate our method on multiple synthetic benchmarks, where we obtain competitive performance. Further, we deploy our algorithm to optimize the beam intensity of the Swiss Free Electron Laser with up to 40 parameters while satisfying safe operation constraints.},

We also present two detailed extensions of Bayesian optimization, with experiments---active user modelling with preferences, and hierarchical reinforcement learning---and a discussion of the pros and cons of Bayesian optimization based on our experiences.},

	abstract = {Plasma wakefields can enable very high accelerating gradients for frontier high energy particle accelerators, in excess of 10 GeV/m. To overcome limits on single stage acceleration, specially shaped drive beams can be used in both linear and nonlinear plasma wakefield accelerators (PWFA), to increase the transformer ratio, implying that the drive beam deceleration is minimized relative to acceleration obtained in the wake. In this Letter, we report the results of a nonlinear PWFA, high transformer ratio experiment using high-charge, longitudinally asymmetric drive beams in a plasma cell. An emittance exchange process is used to generate variable drive current profiles, in conjunction with a long (multiple plasma wavelength) witness beam. The witness beam is energy modulated by the wakefield, yielding a response that contains detailed spectral information in a single-shot measurement. Using these methods, we generate a variety of beam profiles and characterize the wakefields, directly observing transformer ratios up to R=7.8. Furthermore, a spectrally based reconstruction technique, validated by 3D particle-in-cell simulations, is introduced to obtain the drive beam current profile from the decelerating wake data.},

The temporal shape of the drive laser pulse was adjusted automatically to optimize the properties of the electron beam. By changing the software configuration, different properties could be improved. This included the total accelerated charge per bunch, which was doubled, and the average electron energy, which was increased from 22 to 27 MeV. Using experimental measurements directly to provide feedback allows the system to work even when the underlying acceleration mechanisms are not fully understood, and, in fact, studying the optimized pulse shape might reveal new insights into the physical processes responsible. Our work suggests that this technique, which has already been applied with low-power lasers, can be extended to work with petawatt-class laser systems.},

The expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI) measures improvement as the gain in dominated hypervolume relative to a given approximation to the Pareto front. We will review known properties of the EHVI, applications in practice and propose a new exact algorithm for computing EHVI. The new algorithm has asymptotically optimal time complexity O(nlogn). This improves existing computation schemes by a factor of n∕logn. It shows that this measure, at least for a small number of objective functions, is as fast as other simpler measures of multicriteria expected improvement that were considered in recent years.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1904.12672},
	abstract = {In the field of multi-objective optimization algorithms, multi-objective Bayesian Global Optimization (MOBGO) is an important branch, in addition to evolutionary multi-objective optimization algorithms (EMOAs). MOBGO utilizes Gaussian Process models learned from previous objective function evaluations to decide the next evaluation site by maximizing or minimizing an infill criterion. A common criterion in MOBGO is the Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI), which shows a good performance on a wide range of problems, with respect to exploration and exploitation. However, so far it has been a challenge to calculate exact EHVI values efficiently. In this paper, an efficient algorithm for the computation of the exact EHVI for a generic case is proposed. This efficient algorithm is based on partitioning the integration volume into a set of axis-parallel slices. Theoretically, the upper bound time complexities are improved from previously \$O (n{\textasciicircum}2)\$ and \$O(n{\textasciicircum}3)\$, for two- and three-objective problems respectively, to \${\textbackslash}Theta(n{\textbackslash}log n)\$, which is asymptotically optimal. This article generalizes the scheme in higher dimensional case by utilizing a new hyperbox decomposition technique, which was proposed by D\{{\textbackslash}"a\}chert et al, EJOR, 2017. It also utilizes a generalization of the multilayered integration scheme that scales linearly in the number of hyperboxes of the decomposition. The speed comparison shows that the proposed algorithm in this paper significantly reduces computation time. Finally, this decomposition technique is applied in the calculation of the Probability of Improvement (PoI).},

Raster scanning interrupts normal operation and takes considerable time to setup. In this paper, we demonstrate a novel method of measuring the QE map using a ghost imaging framework that correlates the injector laser spatial variation over time with the total charge yield. Ghost imaging enables passive, real-time monitoring of the QE map without manually modifying the injector laser or interrupting injector operation. We first demonstrate the method at the UCLA Pegasus photoinjector with the help of a digital micromirror device (DMD) and a piezoelectric mirror to increase our control of the overall transverse variance of the illumination profile. The reconstruction algorithm parameters are fine-tuned using simulations and the results are validated against the ground truth map acquired using the traditional rastering method. Finally, we apply the technique to data acquired parasitically from the LCLS photoinjector, showing the feasibility of this method to retrieve a QE map without interrupting normal operation.},

This requires balancing exploration (learning about the objective) and exploitation (localizing the maximum), a problem well-studied in the multiarmed bandit literature. In many applications, however, we require that the sampled function values exceed some prespeciﬁed “safety” threshold, a requirement that existing algorithms fail to meet. Examples include medical applications where patient comfort must be guaranteed, recommender systems aiming to avoid user dissatisfaction, and robotic control, where one seeks to avoid controls causing physical harm to the platform. We tackle this novel, yet rich, set of problems under the assumption that the unknown function satisﬁes regularity conditions expressed via a Gaussian process prior. We develop an efﬁcient algorithm called SAFEOPT, and theoretically guarantee its convergence to a natural notion of optimum reachable under safety constraints. We evaluate SAFEOPT on synthetic data, as well as two real applications: movie recommendation, and therapeutic spinal cord stimulation.},

This paper examines some of the methods used to take advantage of parallelization in surrogate based global optimization. A key issue focused on in this review is how different algorithms balance exploration and exploitation. Most of the papers surveyed are adaptive samplers that employ Gaussian Process or Kriging surrogates. These allow sophisticated approaches for balancing exploration and exploitation and even allow to develop algorithms with calculable rate of convergence as function of the number of parallel processors. In addition to optimization based on adaptive sampling, surrogate assisted parallel evolutionary algorithms are also surveyed. Beyond a review of the present state of the art, the paper also argues that methods that provide easy parallelization, like multiple parallel runs, or methods that rely on population of designs for diversity deserve more attention.},

This paper proposes a multi-point mechanism of the expected hypervolume improvement (EHVI) for multi-objective BGO (MOBGO) by the utilization of the truncated EHVI (TEHVI). The basic idea is to divide the objective space into several sub-objective spaces and then search for the optimal solutions in each sub-objective space by using the TEHVI as the infill criterion. We studied the performance of the proposed algorithm and performed comparisons with Kriging believer technique (KB) on five scientific benchmarks and a real-world application problem (i.e., a low-fidelity multi-objective airfoil optimization design). The stochastic experimental results show that the proposed algorithm performs better than the KB with respect to the hypervolume indicator, indicating that the proposed method provides an efficient parallelization technique for MOBGO.},

We prove theoretical upper bounds on the regret with batches of size K for this procedure which show the improvement of the order of sqrt\{K\} for fixed iteration cost over purely sequential versions. Moreover, the multiplicative constants involved have the property of being dimension-free.

We develop an efficient safe Bayesian optimization algorithm, StageOpt, that separates safe region expansion and utility function maximization into two distinct stages. Compared to existing approaches which interleave between expansion and optimization, we show that StageOpt is more efficient and naturally applicable to a broader class of problems. We provide theoretical guarantees for both the satisfaction of safety constraints as well as convergence to the optimal utility value.

Reinforcement learning is a promising alternative that aims to automate this process, yet often requires too many experiments to be practical. In this paper, we propose a solution to this problem by exploiting prior knowledge from simulations, which are readily available for most robotic platforms. Specifically, we extend Entropy Search, a Bayesian optimization algorithm that maximizes information gain from each experiment, to the case of multiple information sources. The result is a principled way to automatically combine cheap, but inaccurate information from simulations with expensive and accurate physical experiments in a cost-effective manner. We apply the resulting method to a cart-pole system, which confirms that the algorithm can find good control policies with fewer experiments than standard Bayesian optimization on the physical system only.},

In this paper, we are interested in situations for which several priors exist but we do not know in advance which one fits best the current situation. We tackle this problem by introducing a novel acquisition function, called Most Likely Expected Improvement (MLEI), that combines the likelihood of the priors and the expected improvement. We evaluate this new acquisition function on a transfer learning task for a 5-DOF planar arm and on a possibly damaged, 6-legged robot that has to learn to walk on flat ground and on stairs, with priors corresponding to different stairs and different kinds of damages. Our results show that MLEI effectively identifies and exploits the priors, even when there is no obvious match between the current situations and the priors.},

This enables flexible knowledge transfer across tasks with differing relatedness, addressing a limitation of the existing methods. We evaluate on the task of tuning hyperparameters of two machine learning algorithms. Treating a fraction of the whole training data as source and the whole as the target task, we show that our method finds the best hyperparameters in the least amount of time compared to both the state-of-art and no transfer method.},

PES codifies this intractable acquisition function in terms of the expected reduction in the differential entropy of the predictive distribution. This reformulation allows PES to obtain approximations that are both more accurate and efficient than other alternatives such as Entropy Search (ES). Furthermore, PES can easily perform a fully Bayesian treatment of the model hyperparameters while ES cannot. We evaluate PES in both synthetic and real-world applications, including optimization problems in machine learning, finance, biotechnology, and robotics.

BGO adds a new point at the position where this infill criterion obtains its optimum. In this chapter, we will review different ways to formulate such infill criteria. A focus will be on approaches that measure improvement utilizing integrals or statistical moments of a probability distribution over the non-dominated space, including the probability of improvement and the expected hypervolume improvement, and upper quantiles of the hypervolume improvement. These criteria require the solution of non-linear integral calculations. Besides summarizing the progress in the computation of such integrals, we will present new, efficient, procedures for the high dimensional expected improvement and probability of improvement. Moreover, the chapter will summarize main properties of these infill criteria, including continuity and differentiability as well as monotonicity properties of the variance and mean value. The latter will be necessary for constructing global optimization algorithms for non-convex problems.},

These multiobjective problems are even more challenging when facing a limited budget of evaluations due to expensive experiments or simulations. In these cases, a specific class of multiobjective optimization algorithms (MOOA) has to be applied. This paper provides a review of contemporary multiobjective approaches based on the singleobjective meta-model-assisted ’Efficient Global Optimization’ (EGO) procedure and describes their main concepts. Additionally, a new EGO-based MOOA is introduced, which utilizes the SS{\textbackslash}mathcal\{S\}-metric or hypervolume contribution to decide which solution is evaluated next. A benchmark on recently proposed test functions is performed allowing a budget of 130 evaluations. The results point out that the maximization of the hypervolume contribution within a real multiobjective optimization is superior to straightforward adaptations of EGO making our new approach capable of approximating the Pareto front of common problems within the allowed budget of evaluations.},

	abstract = {This paper studies an entropy-based multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MBO). The entropy search is successful approach to Bayesian optimization. However, for MBO, existing entropy-based methods ignore trade-off among objectives or introduce unreliable approximations. We propose a novel entropy-based MBO called Pareto-frontier entropy search (PFES) by considering the entropy of Pareto-frontier, which is an essential notion of the optimality of the multi-objective problem. Our entropy can incorporate the trade-off relation of the optimal values, and further, we derive an analytical formula without introducing additional approximations or simplifications to the standard entropy search setting. We also show that our entropy computation is practically feasible by using a recursive decomposition technique which has been known in studies of the Pareto hyper-volume computation. Besides the usual MBO setting, in which all the objectives are simultaneously observed, we also consider the "decoupled" setting, in which the objective functions can be observed separately. PFES can easily adapt to the decoupled setting by considering the entropy of the marginal density for each output dimension. This approach incorporates dependency among objectives conditioned on Pareto-frontier, which is ignored by the existing method. Our numerical experiments show effectiveness of PFES through several benchmark datasets.},

	doi = {10.1109/CEC.2016.7744343},
	abstract = {In optimization with expensive black box evaluations, the expected improvement algorithm (also called efficient global optimization) is a commonly applied method. It uses Gaussian Processes (or Kriging) to build a model of the objective function and uses the expected improvement as an infill criterion, taking into account both - predictive mean and variance. It has been generalized to multi-objective optimization using the expected hypervolume improvement, which measures the expected gain in the hypervolume indicator of a Pareto front approximation. However, this criterion assumes an unbounded objective space even if it is often known a-priori that the objective function values are within a prescribed range, e.g., lower bounded by zero. To take advantage of such a-priori knowledge, this paper introduces the truncated expected hypervolume improvement and a multiobjective efficient global optimization method that is based on it. In this paper it is shown how to compute the truncated expected hypervolume improvement exactly and efficiently. Then it is tested as an infill criterion in efficient global optimization. It is shown that it can effectively make use of a-priori knowledge and achieve better results in cases where such knowledge is given. The usefulness of the new approach is demonstrated in benchmark examples and applications from robust PID (proportional-integral-derivative) controller optimization. The empirical studies in this paper are confined to the bi-objective case.},

In this paper, we suggest a non-dominated sorting-based MOEA, called NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II), which alleviates all of the above three difficulties. Specifically, a fast non-dominated sorting approach with O(MN/sup 2/) computational complexity is presented. Also, a selection operator is presented that creates a mating pool by combining the parent and offspring populations and selecting the best N solutions (with respect to fitness and spread). Simulation results on difficult test problems show that NSGA-II is able, for most problems, to find a much better spread of solutions and better convergence near the true Pareto-optimal front compared to the Pareto-archived evolution strategy and the strength-Pareto evolutionary algorithm - two other elitist MOEAs that pay special attention to creating a diverse Pareto-optimal front. Moreover, we modify the definition of dominance in order to solve constrained multi-objective problems efficiently. Simulation results of the constrained NSGA-II on a number of test problems, including a five-objective, seven-constraint nonlinear problem, are compared with another constrained multi-objective optimizer, and the much better performance of NSGA-II is observed.},

	abstract = {Hypervolume indicator based evolutionary algorithms have been reported to be very promising in many-objective optimization, but the high computational complexity of hypervolume calculation in high dimensions restrains its further applications and developments. In this paper, we develop a fast hypervolume approximation method with both improved speed and accuracy than the previous approximation methods via a new segmentation strategy. The proposed approach consists of two crucial process: segmentation and approximation. The segmentation process recursively finds areas easy to be measured and quantified from the original geometric figure as many as possible, and then divides the measurement of the rest areas into several subproblems. In the approximation process, an improved Monte Carlo simulation is developed to estimate these subproblems. Those two processes are mutually complementary to simultaneously improve the accuracy and the speed of hypervolume approximation. To validate its effectiveness, experimental studies on four widely-used instances are conducted and the simulation results show that the proposed method is ten times faster than other comparison algorithms with a same measurement error. Furthermore, we integrate an incremental version of this method into the framework of SMS-EMOA, and the performance of the integrated algorithm is also very competitive among the experimental algorithms.},

The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

Moreover, GRFM are able to provide estimates of the confidence of their predictions. Predictions and their confidence intervals predicted by GRFM are used by the metamodel assisted EA. It selects the promising members in each generation and carries out exact, costly evaluations only for them. The extensive use of the uncertainty information of predictions for screening the candidate solutions makes it possible to significantly reduce the computational cost of singleand multiobjective EA.

	abstract = {The expected improvement (EI) is a well established criterion in Bayesian global optimization (BGO) and metamodel assisted evolutionary computation, both applied in optimization with costly function evaluations. Recently, it has been adopted in different ways to multiobjective optimization. A promising approach to formulate the expected improvement in this context, is to base it on the hypervolume indicator. Given the Bayesian model of the optimization landscape, the EI in hypervolume computes the expected gain in attained hypervolume for a given input point. Although a formulation of this expected improvement is relatively straightforward, its computation and mathematical properties are still to be investigated. This paper will outline and derive an algorithm for the exact computation of the proposed hypervolume-based EI. Moreover, this paper establishes monotonicity properties of the expected improvement. In particular the effect of the predictive distribution's variance on the hypervolume-based EI and elementary properties of the EI landscape are studied. The monotonicity properties will reveal regions where Pareto front approximations can be improved as well as underexplored regions that are favored by the hypervolume based expected improvement. A first numerical example is included that illustrates the behavior of the hypervolume-based EI in the multiobjective BGO framework.},

	abstract = {The S-metric or hypervolume measure is a distinguished quality measure for solution sets in Pareto optimisation. Once the aim to reach a high S-metric value is appointed, it seems to be promising to directly incorporate it in the optimisation algorithm. This idea has been implemented in the SMS-EMOA, an evolutionary multi-objective optimisation algorithm (EMOA) using the hypervolume measure within its selection operator. Solutions are rated according to their contribution to the dominated hypervolume of the current population. Up to now, the SMS-EMOA has only been applied to functions with two objectives. The work at hand extends these studies, by surveying the behaviour of the algorithm on three-objective problems. Additionally, a new efficient algorithm for the computation of the contributions to the dominated hypervolume in three-dimensional solution spaces is presented. Different variants of selection operators are proposed. Among these, a new one is presented that rates a solution concerning the number of solutions dominating it. So, solutions in less explored regions are preferred. This rating is an efficient alternative to the S-metric criterion whenever a selection among dominated solutions has to be made. Comparative studies on standard benchmark problems show that the SMS-EMOA clearly outperforms other well established EMOA. First results on a challenging real-world problem have been obtained, namely the multipoint design of an airfoil involving three objectives and nonlinear constraints. Not only a clear improvement of the baseline design but a good coverage of the Pareto front with a small limited number of points has been achieved.},

The new idea is to aim explicitly for the maximisation of the dominated hypervolume within the optimisation process. A steady-state EMOA is proposed that features a selection operator based on the hypervolume measure combined with the concept of non-dominated sorting. The algorithm’s population evolves to a well-distributed set of solutions, thereby focussing on interesting regions of the Pareto front. The performance of the devised S metric selection EMOA (SMS-EMOA) is compared to state-of-the-art methods on two- and three-objective benchmark suites as well as on aeronautical real-world applications.},

	abstract = {Optimizing nonlinear systems involving expensive computer experiments with regard to conflicting objectives is a common challenge. When the number of experiments is severely restricted and/or when the number of objectives increases, uncovering the whole set of Pareto optimal solutions is out of reach, even for surrogate-based approaches: the proposed solutions are sub-optimal or do not cover the front well. As non-compromising optimal solutions have usually little point in applications, this work restricts the search to solutions that are close to the Pareto front center. The article starts by characterizing this center, which is defined for any type of front. Next, a Bayesian multi-objective optimization method for directing the search towards it is proposed. Targeting a subset of the Pareto front allows an improved optimality of the solutions and a better coverage of this zone, which is our main concern. A criterion for detecting convergence to the center is described. If the criterion is triggered, a widened central part of the Pareto front is targeted such that sufficiently accurate convergence to it is forecasted within the remaining budget. Numerical experiments show how the resulting algorithm, C-EHI, better locates the central part of the Pareto front when compared to state-of-the-art Bayesian algorithms.},

	abstract = {The Expected Hypervolume Improvement (EHVI) is a frequently used infill criterion in Multi-Objective Bayesian Global Optimization (MOBGO), due to its good ability to lead the exploration. Recently, the computational complexity of EHVI calculation is reduced to O(n log n) for both 2-D and 3-D cases. However, the optimizer in MOBGO still requires a significant amount of time, because the calculation of EHVI is carried out in each iteration and usually tens of thousands of the EHVI calculations are required. This paper derives a formula for the Expected Hypervolume Improvement Gradient (EHVIG) and proposes an efficient algorithm to calculate EHVIG. The new criterion (EHVIG) is utilized by two different strategies to improve the efficiency of the optimizer discussed in this paper. Firstly, it enables gradient ascent methods to be used in MOBGO. Moreover, since the EHVIG of an optimal solution should be a zero vector, it can be regarded as a stopping criterion in global optimization, e.g., in Evolution Strategies. Empirical experiments are performed on seven benchmark problems. The experimental results show that the second proposed strategy, using EHVIG as a stopping criterion for local search, can outperform the normal MOBGO on problems where the optimal solutions are located in the interior of the search space. For the ZDT series test problems, EHVIG still can perform better when gradient projection is applied.},

	abstract = {In many engineering optimization problems, the number of function evaluations is severely limited by time or cost. These problems pose a special challenge to the field of global optimization, since existing methods often require more function evaluations than can be comfortably afforded. One way to address this challenge is to fit response surfaces to data collected by evaluating the objective and constraint functions at a few points. These surfaces can then be used for visualization, tradeoff analysis, and optimization. In this paper, we introduce the reader to a response surface methodology that is especially good at modeling the nonlinear, multimodal functions that often occur in engineering. We then show how these approximating functions can be used to construct an efficient global optimization algorithm with a credible stopping rule. The key to using response surfaces for global optimization lies in balancing the need to exploit the approximating surface (by sampling where it is minimized) with the need to improve the approximation (by sampling where prediction error may be high). Striking this balance requires solving certain auxiliary problems which have previously been considered intractable, but we show how these computational obstacles can be overcome.},

	abstract = {The genetic algorithm (GA) has been a popular technique in optimizing the design of particle accelerators. As a population based algorithm, GA requires a large number of evaluations of the objective functions, which can be time consuming. One can benefit from parallel computing with significantly reduced computing time when fulfilling the function evaluation by a numerical machine model in simulation codes. Indeed, this is the most common approach in GA applications. In this paper, instead of applying GA in the conventional numerical calculations as described above, we present a successful experimental demonstration of implementing GA in real machine based optimization. We conduct the minimization of the average vertical beam size of the SPEAR3 storage ring using GA. Beam loss rate is chosen as the sole objective function because it is inversely proportional to the vertical beam size and can be measured instantaneously in SPEAR3. The decision variables are the strengths of SPEAR3 skew quadrupoles, by varying which we can change both the betatron coupling and the vertical dispersion while searching for the minimum beam size. The results in this paper can shed light on new applications of GAs in the particle accelerator community, for example, optimizing the luminosity of a high energy collider or the injection efficiency of a diffraction limited storage ring in real time.},

First, it relaxes the congruency property of the classical model, which results in a broader area of applicability. For example, the hysteresis loops exhibited by the Stoner-Wohlfarth (1948) magnetic particles can be described by the nonlinear model, while they are not covered by the classical model. Second, the nonlinear model allows one to fit first- and second-order transition curves, while the classical model allows only for fitting of first-order transition curves. As a consequence, the nonlinear model is more accurate.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

However, the computational burden of these simulations often limits their use in practice for design optimization and experiment planning. It also precludes their use as on-line models tied directly to accelerator operation. We introduce an approach based on machine learning to create nonlinear, fast-executing surrogate models that are informed by a sparse sampling of the physics simulation. The models are O(106)–O(107) times more computationally efficient to execute. We also demonstrate that these models can be reliably used with multiobjective optimization to obtain orders-of-magnitude speedup in initial design studies and experiment planning. For example, we required 132 times fewer simulation evaluations to obtain an equivalent solution for our main test case, and initial studies suggest that between 330–550 times fewer simulation evaluations are needed when using an iterative retraining process. Our approach enables new ways for high-fidelity particle accelerator simulations to be used, at comparatively little computational cost.},

For a state-space model of the form yt = f (yt−1, . . . , yt−L), the prediction of y at time t + k is based on the estimates yˆt+k−1, . . . , yˆt+k−L of the previous outputs. We show how, using an analytical Gaussian approximation, we can formally incorporate the uncertainty about intermediate regressor values, thus updating the uncertainty on the current prediction. In this framework, the problem is that of predicting responses at a random input and we compare the Gaussian approximation to the Monte-Carlo numerical approximation of the predictive distribution. The approach is illustrated on a simulated non-linear dynamic example, as well as on a simple one-dimensional static example.},

This architecture gives flexibility to the application developer: whereas in previous "parameter server" designs the management of shared state is built into the system, TensorFlow enables developers to experiment with novel optimizations and training algorithms. TensorFlow supports a variety of applications, with particularly strong support for training and inference on deep neural networks. Several Google services use TensorFlow in production, we have released it as an open-source project, and it has become widely used for machine learning research. In this paper, we describe the TensorFlow dataflow model in contrast to existing systems, and demonstrate the compelling performance that TensorFlow achieves for several real-world applications.},

To model complex and non-differentiable functions, these smoothness assumptions are often too restrictive. One way to alleviate this limitation is to find a different representation of the data by introducing a feature space. This feature space is often learned in an unsupervised way, which might lead to data representations that are not useful for the overall regression task. In this paper, we propose Manifold Gaussian Processes, a novel supervised method that jointly learns a transformation of the data into a feature space and a GP regression from the feature space to observed space. The Manifold GP is a full GP and allows to learn data representations, which are useful for the overall regression task. As a proof-of-concept, we evaluate our approach on complex non-smooth functions where standard GPs perform poorly, such as step functions and robotics tasks with contacts.},

	abstract = {Complexity in solving real-world multicriteria optimization problems often stems from the fact that complex, expensive, and/or time-consuming simulation tools or physical experiments are used to evaluate solutions to a problem. In such settings, it is common to use efficient computational models, often known as surrogates or metamodels, to approximate the outcome (objective or constraint function value) of a simulation or physical experiment. The presence of multiple objective functions poses an additional layer of complexity for surrogate-assisted optimization. For example, complexities may relate to the appropriate selection of metamodels for the individual objective functions, extensive training time of surrogate models, or the optimal use of many-core computers to approximate efficiently multiple objectives simultaneously. Thinking out of the box, complexity can also be shifted from approximating the individual objective functions to approximating the entire Pareto front. This leads to further complexities, namely, how to validate statistically and apply the techniques developed to real-world problems. In this paper, we discuss emerging complexity-related topics in surrogate-assisted multicriteria optimization that may not be prevalent in nonsurrogate-assisted single-objective optimization. These complexities are motivated using several real-world problems in which the authors were involved. We then discuss several promising future research directions and prospective solutions to tackle emerging complexities in surrogate-assisted multicriteria optimization. Finally, we provide insights from an industrial point of view into how surrogate-assisted multicriteria optimization techniques can be developed and applied within a collaborative business environment to tackle real-world problems.},

The overall goal is to approximate the true Pareto set of solutions by minimizing the resources consumed for function evaluations. For example, in power system design optimization, we need to find designs that trade-off cost, size, efficiency, and thermal tolerance using multi-fidelity simulators for design evaluations. In this paper, we propose a novel approach referred as Multi-Fidelity Output Space Entropy Search for Multi-objective Optimization (MF-OSEMO) to solve this problem. The key idea is to select the sequence of candidate input and fidelity-vector pairs that maximize the information gained about the true Pareto front per unit resource cost. Our experiments on several synthetic and real-world benchmark problems show that MF-OSEMO, with both approximations, significantly improves over the state-of-the-art single-fidelity algorithms for multi-objective optimization.},

	abstract = {In Interactive Machine Learning (IML), we iteratively make decisions and obtain noisy observations of an unknown function. While IML methods, e.g., Bayesian optimization and active learning, have been successful in applications, on real-world systems they must provably avoid unsafe decisions. To this end, safe IML algorithms must carefully learn about a priori unknown constraints without making unsafe decisions. Existing algorithms for this problem learn about the safety of all decisions to ensure convergence. This is sample-inefficient, as it explores decisions that are not relevant for the original IML objective. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that renders any existing unsafe IML algorithm safe. Our method works as an add-on that takes suggested decisions as input and exploits regularity assumptions in terms of a Gaussian process prior in order to efficiently learn about their safety. As a result, we only explore the safe set when necessary for the IML problem. We apply our framework to safe Bayesian optimization and to safe exploration in deterministic Markov Decision Processes (MDP), which have been analyzed separately before. Our method outperforms other algorithms empirically.},

Here we present a diagnostic method which reconstructs the longitudinal beam profile at the location of the wakefield-generating source. The methods described derive the longitudinal profile of a charged particle beam solely from measurement of the time-resolved centroid energy change due to wakefield effects. As such, they are insensitive to the beam losses in post-interaction transport often found in common diagnostics. The reconstruction technique is based on a deconvolution algorithm that is fully generalizable to any analytically or numerically calculable Green’s function for the wakefield excitation mechanism. This method is shown to yield precise features in the longitudinal current distribution reconstruction. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficacy of this technique using simulations and experimental examples, in both plasmas and dielectric structures, and compare them to experimentally measured longitudinal beam profiles.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2010.09824},
	abstract = {Particle accelerators require constant tuning during operation to meet beam quality, total charge and particle energy requirements for use in a wide variety of physics, chemistry and biology experiments. Maximizing the performance of an accelerator facility often necessitates multi-objective optimization, where operators must balance trade-offs between multiple objectives simultaneously, often using limited, temporally expensive beam observations. Usually, accelerator optimization problems are solved offline, prior to actual operation, with advanced beamline simulations and parallelized optimization methods (NSGA-II, Swarm Optimization). Unfortunately, it is not feasible to use these methods for online multi-objective optimization, since beam measurements can only be done in a serial fashion, and these optimization methods require a large number of measurements to converge to a useful solution.Here, we introduce a multi-objective Bayesian optimization scheme, which finds the full Pareto front of an accelerator optimization problem efficiently in a serialized manner and is thus a critical step towards practical online multi-objective optimization in accelerators.This method uses a set of Gaussian process surrogate models, along with a multi-objective acquisition function, which reduces the number of observations needed to converge by at least an order of magnitude over current methods.We demonstrate how this method can be modified to specifically solve optimization challenges posed by the tuning of accelerators.This includes the addition of optimization constraints, objective preferences and costs related to changing accelerator parameters.},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is growing in popularity for various particle accelerator applications including anomaly detection such as faulty beam position monitor or RF fault identification, for non-invasive diagnostics, and for creating surrogate models. ML methods such as neural networks (NN) are useful because they can learn input-output relationships in large complex systems based on large data sets. Once they are trained, methods such as NNs give instant predictions of complex phenomenon, which makes their use as surrogate models especially appealing for speeding up large parameter space searches which otherwise require computationally expensive simulations. However, quickly time varying systems are challenging for ML-based approaches because the actual system dynamics quickly drifts away from the description provided by any fixed data set, degrading the predictive power of any ML method, and limits their applicability for real time feedback control of quickly time-varying accelerator components and beams. In contrast to ML methods, adaptive model-independent feedback algorithms are by design robust to un-modeled changes and disturbances in dynamic systems, but are usually local in nature and susceptible to local extrema. In this work, we propose that the combination of adaptive feedback and machine learning, adaptive machine learning (AML), is a way to combine the global feature learning power of ML methods such as deep neural networks with the robustness of model-independent control. We present an overview of several ML and adaptive control methods, their strengths and limitations, and an overview of AML approaches.},

	abstract = {Functionally similar pathways are often seen in biological systems, forming feed-forward controls. The robustness in network motifs such as feed-forward loops (FFLs) has been reported previously. In this work, we studied noise propagation in a development network that has multiple interlinked FFLs. A FFL has the potential of asymmetric noise-filtering (i.e., it works at either the “ON” or the “OFF” state in the target gene). With multiple, interlinked FFLs, we show that the propagated noises are largely filtered regardless of the states in the input genes. The noise-filtering property of an interlinked FFL can be largely derived from that of the individual FFLs and with interlinked FFLs, it is possible to filter noises in both “ON” and “OFF” states in the output. We demonstrated the noise filtering effect in the developmental regulatory network of Caenorhabditis elegans that controls the timing of distal tip cell (DTC) migration. The roles of positive feedback loops involving blmp-1 and the degradation regulation of DRE-1 also studied. Our analyses allow for better inference from network structures to noise-filtering properties and provide insights into the mechanisms behind the precise DTC migration controls in space and time.},

	abstract = {Many fields of basic and applied science require efficiently exploring complex systems with high dimensionality. An example of such a challenge is optimising the performance of plasma fusion experiments. The highly-nonlinear and temporally-varying interaction between the plasma, its environment and external controls presents a considerable complexity in these experiments. A further difficulty arises from the fact that there is no single objective metric that fully captures both plasma quality and equipment constraints. To efficiently optimise the system, we develop the Optometrist Algorithm, a stochastic perturbation method combined with human choice. Analogous to getting an eyeglass prescription, the Optometrist Algorithm confronts a human operator with two alternative experimental settings and associated outcomes. A human operator then chooses which experiment produces subjectively better results. This innovative technique led to the discovery of an unexpected record confinement regime with positive net heating power in a field-reversed configuration plasma, characterised by a {\textgreater}50\% reduction in the energy loss rate and concomitant increase in ion temperature and total plasma energy.},

	abstract = {Physical instabilities of proteins in the form of protein aggregation continue to be a major challenge in the development of protein drug candidates. Aggregation can occur during different stages of product lifecycle such as freeze–thaw, manufacturing, shipping, and storage, and can potentially delay commercialization of candidates. A lack of clear understanding of the underlying mechanism(s) behind protein aggregation and the potential immunogenic reactions renders the presence of aggregates in biotherapeutic products undesirable. Understanding and minimizing aggregation can potentially reduce immunogenic responses and make protein therapeutics safer. Therefore, it is imperative to identify, understand, and control aggregation during early formulation development and develop reliable and orthogonal analytical methodologies to detect and monitor levels of aggregation. Freezing and thawing are typical steps involved in the manufacturing of drug product and could result in complex physical and chemical changes, which in turn could potentially cause protein aggregation. This study provides a systematic approach in understanding and selecting the ideal freeze–thaw conditions for manufacturing of protein-based therapeutics. It identifies the importance of balancing different excipients with an overall goal of sufficiently reducing or eliminating aggregation and developing a stable and scalable formulation. The results demonstrated that the freeze–thaw damage of mAb-1 in aqueous solutions was significantly reduced by identification of optimal freeze–thaw conditions using first a small-scale model with subsequent at-scale verifications. The work provides a framework for successful transfer of drug product manufacturing process from small-scale to the manufacturing scale production environment especially for molecules that are susceptible to freeze–thaw induced degradations.},

	abstract = {High-energy particle accelerators have been crucial in providing a deeper understanding of fundamental particles and the forces that govern their interactions. To increase the energy of the particles or to reduce the size of the accelerator, new acceleration schemes need to be developed. Plasma wakefield acceleration1–5, in which the electrons in a plasma are excited, leading to strong electric fields (so called ‘wakefields’), is one such promising acceleration technique. Experiments have shown that an intense laser pulse6–9 or electron bunch10,11 traversing a plasma can drive electric fields of tens of gigavolts per metre and above—well beyond those achieved in conventional radio-frequency accelerators (about 0.1 gigavolt per metre). However, the low stored energy of laser pulses and electron bunches means that multiple acceleration stages are needed to reach very high particle energies5,12. The use of proton bunches is compelling because they have the potential to drive wakefields and to accelerate electrons to high energy in a single acceleration stage13. Long, thin proton bunches can be used because they undergo a process called self-modulation14–16, a particle–plasma interaction that splits the bunch longitudinally into a series of high-density microbunches, which then act resonantly to create large wakefields. The Advanced Wakefield (AWAKE) experiment at CERN17–19 uses high-intensity proton bunches—in which each proton has an energy of 400 gigaelectronvolts, resulting in a total bunch energy of 19 kilojoules—to drive a wakefield in a ten-metre-long plasma. Electron bunches are then injected into this wakefield. Here we present measurements of electrons accelerated up to two gigaelectronvolts at the AWAKE experiment, in a demonstration of proton-driven plasma wakefield acceleration. Measurements were conducted under various plasma conditions and the acceleration was found to be consistent and reliable. The potential for this scheme to produce very high-energy electron bunches in a single accelerating stage20 means that our results are an important step towards the development of future high-energy particle accelerators21,22.},

However, solvent reorganization occurs on multiple length scales, and selectively measuring short-range solute–solvent interactions at the atomic level with femtosecond time resolution remains a challenge. Here we report femtosecond X-ray scattering and emission measurements following photoinduced charge-transfer excitation in a mixed-valence bimetallic (FeiiRuiii) complex in water, and their interpretation using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Combined experimental and computational analysis reveals that the charge-transfer excited state has a lifetime of 62 fs and that coherent translational motions of the first solvation shell are coupled to the back electron transfer. Our molecular dynamics simulations identify that the observed coherent translational motions arise from hydrogen bonding changes between the solute and nearby water molecules upon photoexcitation, and have an amplitude of tenths of ångströms, 120–200 cm−1 frequency and {\textasciitilde}100 fs relaxation time. This study provides an atomistic view of coherent solvent reorganization mediating ultrafast intramolecular electron transfer.},

A particularly important factor in the development of new chemical reactions is the choice of solvent which can often drastically alter the efficiency and selectivity of a process. Whilst solvent optimisation is usually done in a non-systematic way based upon a chemist's intuition and previous laboratory experience, we illustrate how optimisation of the solvent for a reaction can be carried out by using a 'map of solvent space' in a DoE optimisation. A new solvent map has been developed specifically for optimisation of new chemical reactions using principle component analysis (PCA) incorporating 136 solvents with a wide range of properties. The new solvent map has been used to identify safer alternatives to toxic/hazardous solvents, and also in the optimisation of an SNAr reaction.},

An irregularly shaped region of experimentation arises in situations where there are constraints on the factor level combinations that can be run or restrictions on portions of the region of exploration. Computer-generated designs based on some optimality criterion are a logical alternative for these problems. We give a brief tutorial on design optimality criteria and show how one of these, the D-optimality criteria, can lead to very reasonable designs for constrained regions of interest. We show through a simulation study that D-optimal designs perform very well with respect to the capability of selecting the correct model and accurately estimating the design factor levels that result in the optimal response.},

Design of experiments (DoE) is a statistical approach to process optimization that is used across a variety of industries. It possesses a number of advantages over the traditionally employed “one variable at a time” (OVAT) approach, such as increased experimental efficiency as well as an ability to resolve factor interactions and provide detailed maps of a process’s behavior. Here we demonstrate the utility of DoE to the development and optimization of new radiochemical methodologies and novel PET tracer synthesis. Using DoE to construct experimentally efficient factor screening and optimization studies, we were able to identify critical factors and model their behavior with more than two-fold greater experimental efficiency than the traditional OVAT approach. Additionally, the use of DoE allowed us to glean new insights into the behavior of the CMRF of a number of arylstannane precursors. This information has guided our decision-making efforts while developing efficient reaction conditions that suit the unique process requirements of 18F PET tracer synthesis.},

	abstract = {BinAB is a naturally occurring paracrystalline larvicide distributed worldwide to combat the devastating diseases borne by mosquitoes. These crystals are composed of homologous molecules, BinA and BinB, which play distinct roles in the multi-step intoxication process, transforming from harmless, robust crystals, to soluble protoxin heterodimers, to internalized mature toxin, and finally to toxic oligomeric pores. The small size of the crystals—50 unit cells per edge, on average—has impeded structural characterization by conventional means. Here we report the structure of Lysinibacillus sphaericus BinAB solved de novo by serial-femtosecond crystallography at an X-ray free-electron laser. The structure reveals tyrosine- and carboxylate-mediated contacts acting as pH switches to release soluble protoxin in the alkaline larval midgut. An enormous heterodimeric interface appears to be responsible for anchoring BinA to receptor-bound BinB for co-internalization. Remarkably, this interface is largely composed of propeptides, suggesting that proteolytic maturation would trigger dissociation of the heterodimer and progression to pore formation.},

In the case of group IV–VI, V and related materials, these interactions are strong, and the materials exist near electronic and structural phase transitions. The prototypical example is PbTe whose incipient ferroelectric behaviour has been recently associated with large phonon anharmonicity and thermoelectricity. Here we show that it is primarily electron-phonon coupling involving electron states near the band edges that leads to the ferroelectric instability in PbTe. Using a combination of nonequilibrium lattice dynamics measurements and first principles calculations, we find that photoexcitation reduces the Peierls-like electronic instability and reinforces the paraelectric state. This weakens the long-range forces along the cubic direction tied to resonant bonding and low lattice thermal conductivity. Our results demonstrate how free-electron-laser-based ultrafast X-ray scattering can be utilized to shed light on the microscopic mechanisms that determine materials properties.},

The approach relies on the use of uncertainties and making predictions from a surrogate model together with a utility function that prioritizes the decision making process on unexplored data. We discuss several utility functions and demonstrate their use in materials science applications, impacting both experimental and computational research.

	abstract = {The development of accurate and transferable machine learning (ML) potentials for predicting molecular energetics is a challenging task. The process of data generation to train such ML potentials is a task neither well understood nor researched in detail. In this work, we present a fully automated approach for the generation of datasets with the intent of training universal ML potentials. It is based on the concept of active learning (AL) via Query by Committee (QBC), which uses the disagreement between an ensemble of ML potentials to infer the reliability of the ensemble’s prediction. QBC allows the presented AL algorithm to automatically sample regions of chemical space where the ML potential fails to accurately predict the potential energy. AL improves the overall fitness of ANAKIN-ME (ANI) deep learning potentials in rigorous test cases by mitigating human biases in deciding what new training data to use. AL also reduces the training set size to a fraction of the data required when using naive random sampling techniques. To provide validation of our AL approach, we develop the COmprehensive Machine-learning Potential (COMP6) benchmark (publicly available on GitHub) which contains a diverse set of organic molecules. Active learning-based ANI potentials outperform the original random sampled ANI-1 potential with only 10\% of the data, while the final active learning-based model vastly outperforms ANI-1 on the COMP6 benchmark after training to only 25\% of the data. Finally, we show that our proposed AL technique develops a universal ANI potential (ANI-1x) that provides accurate energy and force predictions on the entire COMP6 benchmark. This universal ML potential achieves a level of accuracy on par with the best ML potentials for single molecules or materials, while remaining applicable to the general class of organic molecules composed of the elements CHNO.},

	abstract = {Bayesian Optimization is a sample-efficient black-box optimization procedure that is typically applied to problems with a small number of independent objectives. However, in practice we often wish to optimize objectives defined over many correlated outcomes (or ``tasks"). For example, scientists may want to optimize the coverage of a cell tower network across a dense grid of locations. Similarly, engineers may seek to balance the performance of a robot across dozens of different environments via constrained or robust optimization. However, the Gaussian Process (GP) models typically used as probabilistic surrogates for multi-task Bayesian Optimization scale poorly with the number of outcomes, greatly limiting applicability. We devise an efficient technique for exact multi-task GP sampling that combines exploiting Kronecker structure in the covariance matrices with Matheron's identity, allowing us to perform Bayesian Optimization using exact multi-task GP models with tens of thousands of correlated outputs. In doing so, we achieve substantial improvements in sample efficiency compared to existing approaches that only model aggregate functions of the outcomes. We demonstrate how this unlocks a new class of applications for Bayesian Optimization across a range of tasks in science and engineering, including optimizing interference patterns of an optical interferometer with more than 65,000 outputs.},

These problems are challenging since the feasible set is typically non-convex and hard to ﬁnd, in addition to the curses of dimensionality and the heterogeneity of the underlying functions. In particular, these characteristics dramatically impact the performance of Bayesian optimization methods, that otherwise have become the de facto standard for sample-eﬃcient optimization in unconstrained settings, leaving practitioners with evolutionary strategies or heuristics. We propose the scalable constrained Bayesian optimization (SCBO) algorithm that overcomes the above challenges and pushes the applicability of Bayesian optimization far beyond the state-of-the-art. A comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that SCBO achieves excellent results on a variety of benchmarks. To this end, we propose two new control problems that we expect to be of independent value for the scientiﬁc community.},

Here, we experimentally determine the Preisach (hysteron) distribution for two ferroelectric systems and show how its broadening directly relates to the materials’ morphology. We connect the Preisach distribution to measured microscopic switching kinetics that underlay the macroscopic dispersive switching kinetics as commonly observed for practical ferroelectrics. The presented results reveal that the in principle mathematical construct of the Preisach model has a strong physical basis and is a powerful tool to explain polarization switching at all time scales in different types of ferroelectrics. These insights lead to guidelines for further advancement of the ferroelectric materials both for conventional and multi-bit data storage applications.},

	abstract = {In many situations across computational science and engineering, multiple computational models are available that describe a system of interest. These different models have varying evaluation costs and varying fidelities. Typically, a computationally expensive high-fidelity model describes the system with the accuracy required by the current application at hand, while lower-fidelity models are less accurate but computationally cheaper than the high-fidelity model. Outer-loop applications, such as optimization, inference, and uncertainty quantification, require multiple model evaluations at many different inputs, which often leads to computational demands that exceed available resources if only the high-fidelity model is used. This work surveys multifidelity methods that accelerate the solution of outer-loop applications by combining high-fidelity and low-fidelity model evaluations, where the low-fidelity evaluations arise from an explicit low-fidelity model (e.g., a simplified physics approximation, a reduced model, a data-fit surrogate) that approximates the same output quantity as the high-fidelity model. The overall premise of these multifidelity methods is that low-fidelity models are leveraged for speedup while the high-fidelity model is kept in the loop to establish accuracy and/or convergence guarantees. We categorize multifidelity methods according to three classes of strategies: adaptation, fusion, and filtering. The paper reviews multifidelity methods in the outer-loop contexts of uncertainty propagation, inference, and optimization.},

As realism commands hi-fidelity simulations, computation costs call for global optimization algorithms under parsimonious evaluation budgets. Bayesian optimization approaches are well adapted to such settings as they allow the exploration of parameter spaces in a principled way so as to iteratively locate the point(s) of global optimum while maintaining an approximation of the objective function with an instrumental quantification of prediction uncertainty. Here, we adapt a Bayesian optimization approach to localize a contaminant source in a discretized spatial domain. We thus demonstrate the potential of such a method for hydrogeological applications and also provide test cases for the optimization community. The localization problem is illustrated for cases where the geology is assumed to be perfectly known. Two 2-D synthetic cases that display sharp hydraulic conductivity contrasts and specific connectivity patterns are investigated. These cases generate highly nonlinear objective functions that present multiple local minima. A derivative-free global optimization algorithm relying on a Gaussian process model and on the expected improvement criterion is used to efficiently localize the point of minimum of the objective functions, which corresponds to the contaminant source location. Even though concentration measurements contain a significant level of proportional noise, the algorithm efficiently localizes the contaminant source location. The variations of the objective function are essentially driven by the geology, followed by the design of the monitoring well network. The data and scripts used to generate objective functions are shared to favor reproducible research. This contribution is important because the functions present multiple local minima and are inspired from a practical field application. Sharing these complex objective functions provides a source of test cases for global optimization benchmarks and should help with designing new and efficient methods to solve this type of problem.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Active policy search combines the trial-and-error methodology from policy search with Bayesian optimization to actively find the optimal policy. First, policy search is a type of reinforcement learning which has become very popular for robot control, for its ability to deal with complex continuous state and action spaces. Second, Bayesian optimization is a sample efficient global optimization method that uses a surrogate model, like a Gaussian process, and optimal decision making to carefully select each sample during the optimization process. Sample efficiency is of paramount importance when each trial involves the real robot, expensive Monte Carlo runs, or a complex simulator. Black-box Bayesian optimization generally assumes a cost function from a stationary process, because nonstationary modeling is usually based on prior knowledge. However, many control problems are inherently nonstationary due to their failure conditions, terminal states and other abrupt effects. In this paper, we present a kernel function specially designed for Bayesian optimization, that allows nonstationary modeling without prior knowledge, using an adaptive local region. The new kernel results in an improved local search (exploitation), without penalizing the global search (exploration), as shown experimentally in well-known optimization benchmarks and robot control scenarios. We finally show its potential for the design of the wing shape of a UAV.},

	abstract = {Particle accelerators require constant tuning during operation to meet beam quality, total charge and particle energy requirements for use in a wide variety of physics, chemistry and biology experiments. Maximizing the performance of an accelerator facility often necessitates multiobjective optimization, where operators must balance trade-offs between multiple competing objectives simultaneously, often using limited, temporally expensive beam observations. Usually, accelerator optimization problems are solved off-line, prior to actual operation, with advanced beam line simulations and parallelized optimization methods (NSGA-II, swarm optimization). Unfortunately, it is not feasible to use these methods for online multiobjective optimization, since beam measurements can only be done in a serial fashion, and these optimization methods require a large number of measurements to converge to a useful solution. Here, we introduce a multiobjective Bayesian optimization scheme, which finds the full Pareto front of an accelerator optimization problem efficiently in a serialized manner and is thus a critical step towards practical online multiobjective optimization in accelerators. This method uses a set of Gaussian process surrogate models, along with a multiobjective acquisition function, to reduce the number of observations needed to converge by at least an order of magnitude over current methods. We demonstrate how this method can be modified to specifically solve optimization challenges posed by the tuning of accelerators. This includes the addition of optimization constraints, objective preferences and costs related to changing accelerator parameters.},

Characterization of the accelerated beam response to accelerator input parameters is often the first step when conducting accelerator-based experiments. Currently used techniques for characterization, such as grid-like parameter sampling scans, become impractical when extended to higher dimensional input spaces, when complicated measurement constraints are present, or prior information known about the beam response is scarce. Here in this work, we describe an adaptation of the popular Bayesian optimization algorithm, which enables a turn-key exploration of input parameter spaces. Our algorithm replaces  the need for parameter scans while minimizing prior information needed about the measurement’s behavior and associated measurement constraints. We experimentally demonstrate that our algorithm autonomously conducts an adaptive, multi-parameter exploration of input parameter space, potentially orders of magnitude faster than conventional grid-like parameter scans, while making highly constrained, single-shot beam phase-space measurements and accounts for costs associated with changing input parameters. In addition to applications in accelerator-based scientific experiments, this algorithm addresses challenges shared by many scientific disciplines, and is thus applicable to autonomously conducting experiments over a broad range of research topics.},

We formulate the problem as an optimal experimental design for Bayesian inferences of the limit state (i.e., the failure boundary) and propose an efficient numerical scheme to solve the resulting optimization problem. In particular, the proposed limit-state inference method is capable of determining multiple sampling points at a time, and thus it is well suited for problems where multiple computer simulations can be performed in parallel. The accuracy and performance of the proposed method is demonstrated by both academic and practical examples.},

	abstract = {Bayesian optimization (BO) is a class of global optimization algorithms, suitable for minimizing an expensive objective function in as few function evaluations as possible. While BO budgets are typically given in iterations, this implicitly measures convergence in terms of iteration count and assumes each evaluation has identical cost. In practice, evaluation costs may vary in different regions of the search space. For example, the cost of neural network training increases quadratically with layer size, which is a typical hyperparameter. Cost-aware BO measures convergence with alternative cost metrics such as time, energy, or money, for which vanilla BO methods are unsuited. We introduce Cost Apportioned BO (CArBO), which attempts to minimize an objective function in as little cost as possible. CArBO combines a cost-effective initial design with a cost-cooled optimization phase which depreciates a learned cost model as iterations proceed. On a set of 20 black-box function optimization problems we show that, given the same cost budget, CArBO finds significantly better hyperparameter configurations than competing methods.},

	abstract = {In the early embryonic cell cycle, Cdc2–cyclin B functions like an autonomous oscillator, whose robust biochemical rhythm continues even when DNA replication or mitosis is blocked1. At the core of the oscillator is a negative feedback loop; cyclins accumulate and produce active mitotic Cdc2–cyclin B2,3; Cdc2 activates the anaphase-promoting complex (APC); the APC then promotes cyclin degradation and resets Cdc2 to its inactive, interphase state. Cdc2 regulation also involves positive feedback4, with active Cdc2–cyclin B stimulating its activator Cdc25 (refs 5–7) and inactivating its inhibitors Wee1 and Myt1 (refs 8–11). Under the correct circumstances, these positive feedback loops could function as a bistable trigger for mitosis12,13, and oscillators with bistable triggers may be particularly relevant to biological applications such as cell cycle regulation14,15,16,17. Therefore, we examined whether Cdc2 activation is bistable. We confirm that the response of Cdc2 to non-degradable cyclin B is temporally abrupt and switch-like, as would be expected if Cdc2 activation were bistable. We also show that Cdc2 activation exhibits hysteresis, a property of bistable systems with particular relevance to biochemical oscillators. These findings help establish the basic systems-level logic of the mitotic oscillator.},

The Bilinear Model, that is one of the simplest hysteretic models which can be emanated from the proposed class, is first described to clarify the physical meaning of the quantities adopted in the formulation. Specifically, the potentiality of the proposed class is witnessed by the Exponential Model, able to simulate more complex hysteretic behaviors of rate-independent mechanical systems and materials exhibiting either kinematic hardening or softening. The accuracy and the computational efficiency of this last model are assessed by carrying out nonlinear time history analyses, for a single degree of freedom mechanical system having a rate-independent kinematic hardening behavior, subjected either to a harmonic or to a random force.

A recurrent neural network coupled with Preisach play operators is proposed, along with a novel validation method for the identification of the model\&rsquo;s parameters. The proposed model is found to predict the magnetic flux density of ARMCO pure iron with a Normalised Root Mean Square Error (NRMSE) better than 0.7\%, when trained with just six different hysteresis loops. The model is evaluated using ramp-rates not used in the training procedure, which shows the ability of the model to predict data which has not been measured. The results demonstrate that the Preisach model based on a recurrent neural network can accurately describe ferromagnetic dynamic hysteresis when trained with a limited amount of data, showing the model\&rsquo;s potential in the field of materials science.},

	abstract = {Hysteresis in smart materials hinders the wider applicability of such materials in actuators. In this paper, a systematic approach for coping with hysteresis is presented. The method is illustrated through the example of controlling a commercially available magnetostrictive actuator. We utilize the low-dimensional model for the magnetostrictive actuator that was developed in earlier work. For low frequency inputs, the model approximates to a rate-independent hysteresis operator, with current as its input and magnetization as its output. Magnetostrictive strain is proportional to the square of the magnetization. In this paper, we use a classical Preisach operator for the rate-independent hysteresis operator. In this paper, we present the results of experiments conducted on a commercial magnetostrictive actuator, the purpose of which was the control of the displacement/strain output. A constrained least-squares algorithm is employed to identify a discrete approximation to the Preisach measure. We then discuss a nonlinear inversion algorithm for the resulting Preisach operator, based on the theory of strictly-increasing operators. This algorithm yields a control input signal to produce a desired magnetostrictive response. The effectiveness of the inversion scheme is demonstrated via an open-loop trajectory tracking experiment.},

	url = {https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-948318/v1},
	abstract = {Superconducting Radio-Frequency cavities are currently made out of niobium. Niobium cavities are limited by the magnetic field on the cavity walls due to the entry of vortices at the field of first vortex penetration, Hvp. Low temperature baking in vacuum or low pressure gas atmosphere removes the strong decrease of the quality factor with accelerating gradient (high field Q-slope). Some cavities reach surface magnetic field above the lower critical field, Hc1. One hypothesis for this performance increase is that the outer layer affected by the treatments acts as a barrier for vortex penetration (effective bilayer). Using a vibrating sample magnetometer the field of first flux penetration (Hvp) was measured for Nb ellipsoids with various low temperature treatments. All Hvp values were found to be consistent with the lower critical field, Hc1 , as predicted for clean niobium. This led to the conclusion that a metastable flux free state above Hc1 cannot be observed in DC magnetometry for low temperature baked niobium unlike for bilayers consisting of two superconductors as previously published. The effect of flux pinning differed significantly between treatments, suggesting that the high field Q-slope mitigation might be related to vortex pinning in the surface of the cavities.},

A compensation approach is developed to calculate a modified course of input motion for a desired velocity profile in systems with known backlash. The modified input trajectory contains accelerating and decelerating motion features to traverse the backlash area in minimal time. The method was proved with a dc-motor driven gear train. Results show that the output motion delay could be remarkably reduced. The time to overcome the backlash gap depends upon the desired velocity and the amount of backlash introduced to the system. Time savings between 43\% and 74\% could be measured with the utilized experimental setup. The proposed velocity compensation method is most efficient for low operating speeds and large mounting allowance between gears.},

Instead, here we use a fast approximate model from physics simulations to design the GP model. The GP is then employed to make inferences from sequential online observations in order to optimize the system. Simulation and experimental studies were carried out to demonstrate the method for online control of a storage ring. Our method is a simple prescription to construct a custom GP model, including correlations between the high-dimensional input space, while encoding the physical response of a system. The ability to inform the machine-learning model with physics, without relying on the availability and range of prior data, may have wide applications in science.},

	abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is a subfield of artificial intelligence. The term applies broadly to a collection of computational algorithms and techniques that train systems from raw data rather than a priori models. ML techniques are now technologically mature enough to be applied to particle accelerators, and we expect that ML will become an increasingly valuable tool to meet new demands for beam energy, brightness, and stability. The intent of this white paper is to provide a high-level introduction to problems in accelerator science and operation where incorporating ML-based approaches may provide significant benefit. We review ML techniques currently being investigated at particle accelerator facilities, and we place specific emphasis on active research efforts and promising exploratory results. We also identify new applications and discuss their feasibility, along with the required data and infrastructure strategies. We conclude with a set of guidelines and recommendations for laboratory managers and administrators, emphasizing the logistical and technological requirements for successfully adopting this technology. This white paper also serves as a summary of the discussion from a recent workshop held at SLAC on ML for particle accelerators.},

	abstract = {Electromagnetic simulations of devices with soft materials and the study of the influence of cutting edge deformations/stresses on the degradation of magnetic performances require the identification of hysteresis parameters. Hence, computationally efficient implementation and identification of the hysteresis model is needed to obtain a solution with high accuracy within a reasonable time. Many studies on hysteresis identification have been reported, but few compare different methods to identify the optimal one. In the present study, we focus on the Preisach hysteresis model combined with the Lorentz modified distribution function to describe the magnetic behavior of a fully processed nonoriented Fe–3wt\% Si steel sheet under static excitation. Three different identification techniques are implemented and evaluated: particle swarm optimization (PSO), genetic algorithms (GAs), and nonlinear least-squares approximation based on the Levenberg–Marquardt (LM) method. We evaluate each approach with regard to the accuracy, central processing unit computation time, and repeatability of the results. All the techniques perform well in this high-nonlinearity problem. The root-mean-square error is {\textless} 3\%. However, the implementation of the GA is more complex than the PSO and LM methods. The optimized parameters are obtained in a few minutes in the case of the LM method, but a few hours are required for both the other techniques. Therefore, the LM method is the most suitable technique for the identification of Preisach hysteresis.},

The anhysteretic magnetization curve is derived using a mean field approach in which the magnetization of any domain is coupled to the magnetic field H and the bulk magnetization M. The anhysteretic emerges as the magnetization which would be achieved in the absence of domain wall pinning. Hysteresis is then included by considering the effects of pinning of magnetic domain walls on defect sites. This gives rise to a frictional force opposing the movement of domain walls. The impedance to motion is expressed via a single parameter k, leading to a simple model equation of state. This exhibits all of the main features of hysteresis such as the initial magnetization curve, saturation of magnetization, coercivity, remanence, and hysteresis loss.},

	abstract = {Medium energy electron synchrotrons used for the production of high energy photons from synchrotron radiation is an accelerator growth industry. Many of these accelerators have been built or are under construction to satisfy the needs of synchrotron light users throughout the world. Because of the long beam lifetimes required for these synchrotrons, these medium energy accelerators require the highest quality magnets of various types. Other accelerators, for instance low and medium energy boosters for high energy physics machines and electron/positron colliders, require the same types of magnets. Because of these needs, magnet design lectures, were organized and presented periodically at biennual classes organized under the auspices of the US Particle Accelerator School (USPAS). These classes were divided among areas of magnet design from fundamental theoretical considerations, the design approaches and algorithms for permanent magnet wigglers and undulators and the design and engineering of conventional accelerator magnets. The conventional magnet lectures were later expanded for the internal training of magnet designers at LLNL at the request of Lou Bertolini. Because of the broad nature of magnet design, Dr. S. Y. Lee, the former Director of the Particle Accelerator School, saw the need for a specialized course covering the various aspects of the design, engineering and fabrication of conventional magnets. This section of the class was isolated and augmented using the LLNL developed material resulting in the class on conventional magnet design. Conventional magnets are defined (for the purposes of this publication) as magnets whose field shape is dominated by the shape of the iron magnet yoke and are excited by coils, usually wound from solid or hollow water-cooled copper or aluminum conductors. This publication collects the lecture notes, written for the first course in the USPAS conventional magnet design course and evolved over subsequent presentations of this same course, and organizes the material roughly divided among two parts. One part is theoretical and computational and attempts to provide a foundation for later chapters which exploit the expressions and algorithms for the engineering and design calculations required to specify magnet conceptual designs. A chapter is devoted to the description and use of one of many magnet codes used to characterize the two dimensional field resulting from various magnet cross-sections. A chapter is included which exploits the two-dimensional theory and applies the mathematics to techniques and systems for magnet measurement. The second part of this publication ranges to practical issues associated with the fabrication of components, assembly, installation and alignment of magnets. This section also includes fabrication practices which respond to personnel and equipment protection needs. Required design calculations are supplemented by examples and problems. A CD is included with tools provided to simplify the computation of some of the more tedious relationships. This CD also includes useful photographs and pictures describing the high volume production of typical magnet types, which if included in the publication will add too many pages and increase the cost of publication. Styles among those facing similar problems will result in a wide variation of individual magnet designs. Designs and technologies will evolve and improve. This publication provides a snapshot of the present technology and presents as examples the magnet designs developed in response to the needs of several projects, the Advanced Light Source at LBNL, PEPII Low Energy Ring and SPEAR3 synchrotron light source at SLAC and the Australian Light Source, currently under construction in Melbourne. In each example, the reasons for fabrication design decisions are itemized and rationalized as much as is reasonable. The examples presented in this publication are provided as starting points which can be used as a design basis for magnets required for future projects. It is hoped that the listing of some design choices and the motivation for these choices will be useful. It is the intention of the author to publish a document collecting and archiving the tools and techniques learned from the past masters in the craft and to provide a useful reference for future magnet designers.},

	abstract = {The electron beam for the Advanced Photon Source (APS) at Argonne National Laboratory is generated from a thermionic RF gun and accelerated by a s-band linear accelerator – the APS linac. While the APS linac lattice is set up using a model developed with ELEGANT [1], the thermionic RF gun front-end beam dynamics has been difficult to model. One of the issues is that beam properties from thermionic gun can vary. As a result, linac front-end beam tuning is required to establish good matching and maximize the charge transported through the linac. A traditional Nelder-Mead simplex optimizer has been used to find the best settings for the sixteen magnets. However it takes a long time, and requires a higher signal to noise ratio than Gaussian Process to get started tuning. The Gaussian Process (GP) optimizer does not have the initial condition limitation and runs several times faster. In this paper, we report our data collection and analysis for the training of the GP hyperparameters, and discuss the application of GP optimizer on the APS linac front-end optimization for maximum bunch charge transportation efficiency through the linac.},

The friction behavior in both presliding and sliding regimes is captured by generalized Maxwell-slip model. The hysteresis is described by a Preisach operator. The distributed model parameters are identified from experimental data obtained from internal system signals and external angular encoder mounted to the second joint of a 6-DOF industrial robot.

	abstract = {The superconducting orbit corrector magnets (MCBC, MCBY and MCBX) in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN will be used to generate parallel separation and crossing angles at the interaction points during the different phases that will bring the LHC beams into collision. However, the field errors generated by the inherent hysteresis in the operation region of the orbit correctors may lead to unwanted orbit perturbations that could have a critical effect on luminosity. This paper presents the results obtained from dedicated cryogenic measurements on the orbit correctors and the resulting simulations performed to quantify the impact of the hysteresis on the LHC orbit.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks (NNs) are powerful black box predictors that have recently achieved impressive performance on a wide spectrum of tasks. Quantifying predictive uncertainty in NNs is a challenging and yet unsolved problem.  Bayesian NNs, which learn a distribution over weights, are currently the state-of-the-art for estimating predictive uncertainty; however these require significant modifications to the training procedure and are computationally expensive compared to standard (non-Bayesian)  NNs.  We propose an alternative to Bayesian NNs that is simple to implement, readily parallelizable, requires very little hyperparameter tuning, and yields high quality predictive uncertainty estimates. Through a series of experiments on classification and regression benchmarks, we demonstrate that our method produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates which are as good or better than approximate Bayesian NNs. To assess robustness to dataset shift, we evaluate the predictive uncertainty on test examples from known and unknown distributions, and show that our method is able to express higher uncertainty on out-of-distribution examples. We demonstrate the scalability of our method by evaluating predictive uncertainty estimates on ImageNet.},

	abstract = {Data sparseness or overﬁtting is a serious problem in natural language processing employing machine learning methods. This is still true even for the maximum entropy (ME) method, whose ﬂexible modeling capability has alleviated data sparseness more successfully than the other probabilistic models in many NLP tasks. Although we usually estimate the model so that it completely satisﬁes the equality constraints on feature expectations with the ME method, complete satisfaction leads to undesirable overﬁtting, especially for sparse features, since the constraints derived from a limited amount of training data are always uncertain. To control overﬁtting in ME estimation, we propose the use of box-type inequality constraints, where equality can be violated up to certain predeﬁned levels that reﬂect this uncertainty. The derived models, inequality ME models, in effect have regularized estimation with L1 norm penalties of bounded parameters. Most importantly, this regularized estimation enables the model parameters to become sparse. This can be thought of as automatic feature selection, which is expected to improve generalization performance further. We evaluate the inequality ME models on text categorization datasets, and demonstrate their advantages over standard ME estimation, similarly motivated Gaussian MAP estimation of ME models, and support vector machines (SVMs), which are one of the state-of-the-art methods for text categorization.},

Hysteresis effects in magnetic, mechanical, and material components of accelerators are often neglected in online accelerator models used to inform control algorithms, even though reproducibility errors from systems exhibiting hysteresis are not negligible in high precision accelerators. In this Letter, we combine the classical Preisach model of hysteresis with machine learning techniques to efficiently create nonparametric, high-fidelity models of arbitrary systems exhibiting hysteresis. We experimentally demonstrate how these methods can be used in situ, where a hysteresis model of an accelerator magnet is combined with a Bayesian statistical model of the beam response, allowing characterization of magnetic hysteresis solely from beam-based measurements. Finally, we explore how using these joint hysteresis-Bayesian statistical models allows us to overcome optimization performance limitations that arise when hysteresis effects are ignored.},

	abstract = {Bayesian techniques have been shown to be extremely efﬁcient in optimizing expensive to evaluate black box functions, in both computational (ofﬂine design) and physical (online experimental control) contexts. Optimizing physical systems often comes with extra challenges due to costs associated with changing parameters in real life experimentation, such as measurement location in physical space or mechanical/electrical actuation in scientiﬁc equipment. In these cases, the cost of changing a given input parameter is often proportional to the magnitude of the change. To minimize these costs, optimization algorithms can simply limit the maximum distance travelled in input space during each step. However, hard restrictions on travel distances inhibits global exploration advantages normally afforded by Bayesian optimization algorithms. In this work, we describe a proximal weighting term that can bias acquisition functions towards localized exploration, while still allowing for large travel distances, if far away points are predicted to be valuable for observation. We describe a use case where this weighting is used to minimize the uncertainty of a particle accelerator Bayesian model in a smooth manner, which in turn, minimizes temporal costs associated with changing input parameters.},

To maximize the performance of this system, stringent requirements on the beam alignment to the central beam axis and on the ion-optical settings need to be achieved. These can be difficult to attain through manual tuning by human operators without potentially leaving the system in a suboptimal and irreproducible state. In this work, we present the first development of online Bayesian optimization with a Gaussian process model to tune an ion beam through a nuclear astrophysics recoil separator. We show that this method achieves small incoming angular deviations ({\textless}1 mrad) in an efficient and reproducible manner that is at least 3 times faster than standard hand-tuning. Additionally, we present a Bayesian method for experimental optimization of the ion optics, and show that it validates the nominal theoretical ion-optical settings of the device, and improves the mass separation by 32\% for some beams.},

	abstract = {Bayesian optimization is a sample-efficient approach to solving global optimization problems. Along with a surrogate model, this approach relies on theoretically motivated value heuristics (acquisition functions) to guide the search process. Maximizing acquisition functions yields the best performance; unfortunately, this ideal is difficult to achieve since optimizing acquisition functions per se is frequently non-trivial. This statement is especially true in the parallel setting, where acquisition functions are routinely non-convex, high-dimensional, and intractable. Here, we demonstrate how many popular acquisition functions can be formulated as Gaussian integrals amenable to the reparameterization trick and, ensuingly, gradient-based optimization. Further, we use this reparameterized representation to derive an efficient Monte Carlo estimator for the upper confidence bound acquisition function in the context of parallel selection.},

The main advantages of the method are: (1) it has the ability to handle unknown, time-varying systems, (2) it gives known bounds on parameter update rates, (3) we give an analytic proof of its convergence and its stability, and (4) it has a simple digital implementation through a control system such as the experimental physics and industrial control system (EPICS). Because this technique is model independent it may be useful as a real-time, in-hardware, feedback-based optimization scheme for uncertain and time-varying systems. In particular, it is robust enough to handle uncertainty due to coupling, thermal cycling, misalignments, and manufacturing imperfections. As a result, it may be used as a fine-tuning supplement for existing accelerator tuning/control schemes. We present multiparticle simulation results demonstrating the scheme’s ability to simultaneously adaptively adjust the set points of 22 quadrupole magnets and two rf buncher cavities in the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center (LANSCE) Linear Accelerator’s transport region, while the beam properties and rf phase shift are continuously varying. The tuning is based only on beam current readings, without knowledge of particle dynamics. We also present an outline of how to implement this general scheme in software for optimization, and in hardware for feedback-based control/tuning, for a wide range of systems.},

In addition to tracking with and without errors, elegant performs optimization of tracked properties, as well as computation and optimization of Twiss parameters, radiation integrals, matrices, and floor coordinates. Orbit/trajectory, tune, and chromaticity correction are supported. elegant is fully compliant with the Self Describing Data Sets [1, 2] (SDDS) file protocol, and hence uses the SDDS Toolkit for pre- and postprocessing. This permits users to prepare scripts to run the code in a flexible and automated fashion. It is particularly well suited to multistage simulation and concurrent simulation on many workstations.

	abstract = {Optimizing nonlinear systems involving expensive computer experiments with regard to conflicting objectives is a common challenge. When the number of experiments is severely restricted and/or when the number of objectives increases, uncovering the whole set of Pareto optimal solutions is out of reach, even for surrogate-based approaches: the proposed solutions are sub-optimal or do not cover the front well. As non-compromising optimal solutions have usually little point in applications, this work restricts the search to solutions that are close to the Pareto front center. The article starts by characterizing this center, which is defined for any type of front. Next, a Bayesian multi-objective optimization method for directing the search towards it is proposed. Targeting a subset of the Pareto front allows an improved optimality of the solutions and a better coverage of this zone, which is our main concern. A criterion for detecting convergence to the center is described. If the criterion is triggered, a widened central part of the Pareto front is targeted such that sufficiently accurate convergence to it is forecasted within the remaining budget. Numerical experiments show how the resulting algorithm, C-EHI, better locates the central part of the Pareto front when compared to state-of-the-art Bayesian algorithms.},

In this paper, we explore whether it is possible to transfer the knowledge gained from previous optimizations to new tasks in order to find optimal hyperparameter settings more efficiently. Our approach is based on extending multi-task Gaussian processes to the framework of Bayesian optimization. We show that this method significantly speeds up the optimization process when compared to the standard single-task approach. We further propose a straightforward extension of our algorithm in order to jointly minimize the average error across multiple tasks and demonstrate how this can be used to greatly speed up {\textbackslash}textbackslash(k{\textbackslash}textbackslash)-fold cross-validation. Lastly, our most significant contribution is an adaptation of a recently proposed acquisition function, entropy search, to the cost-sensitive and multi-task settings. We demonstrate the utility of this new acquisition function by utilizing a small dataset in order to explore hyperparameter settings for a large dataset. Our algorithm dynamically chooses which dataset to query in order to yield the most information per unit cost.},

Heretofore it was not possible to measure the details of the transverse phase space distributions of high-energy electron beams with the precision required to predict FEL performance. Standard techniques for measuring the transverse phase space of relativistic electron beams treat the phase space distributions as ellipses and only measure the sigma matrices that define the ellipses. These techniques give no information about the detailed structure of the phase space distributions. We have developed a new technique to measure transverse phase space that combines quadrupole-scanning techniques with tomographic image reconstruction to measure the actual phase space distributions while making no a priori assumptions about the distributions. This process is capable of reconstructing phase space distributions that are not elliptical. Both computer simulations and experiments verify that phase space tomography makes the detailed measurement of the phase space distributions possible at high energies. Detailed reconstructions of the phase space distribution of a 44 MeV electron beam from the Mark III FEL are presented.},

	abstract = {Tomography — the reconstruction of a two-dimensional image from a series of its one-dimensional projections — is now a very broad topic with a wealth of algorithms for the reconstructions of both qualitative and quantitative images. One of the simplest algorithms has been modified to take into account the nonlinearity of large-amplitude synchrotron motion in a particle accelerator. This permits the accurate reconstruction of longitudinal phase space density from one-dimensional bunch profile data. The algorithm was developed in Mathematica™ in order to exploit the extensive built-in functions and graphics. Subsequently, it has been recoded in Fortran 90 with the aim of reducing the execution time by at least a factor of one hundred. The choice of Fortran 90 was governed by the desire ultimately to exploit parallel architectures, but sequential compilation and execution have already largely yielded the required gain in speed. The use of the method to produce longitudinal phase space plots, animated sequences of the evolution of phase space density and to estimate accelerator parameters is presented. More generally, the new algorithm constitutes an extension of computerized tomography which carers for nonrigid bodies whose projections cannot be measured simultaneously.},

	abstract = {Deep ensembles have been empirically shown to be a promising approach for improving accuracy, uncertainty and out-of-distribution robustness of deep learning models. While deep ensembles were theoretically motivated by the bootstrap, non-bootstrap ensembles trained with just random initialization also perform well in practice, which suggests that there could be other explanations for why deep ensembles work well. Bayesian neural networks, which learn distributions over the parameters of the network, are theoretically well-motivated by Bayesian principles, but do not perform as well as deep ensembles in practice, particularly under dataset shift. One possible explanation for this gap between theory and practice is that popular scalable variational Bayesian methods tend to focus on a single mode, whereas deep ensembles tend to explore diverse modes in function space. We investigate this hypothesis by building on recent work on understanding the loss landscape of neural networks and adding our own exploration to measure the similarity of functions in the space of predictions. Our results show that random initializations explore entirely different modes, while functions along an optimization trajectory or sampled from the subspace thereof cluster within a single mode predictions-wise, while often deviating significantly in the weight space. Developing the concept of the diversity–accuracy plane, we show that the decorrelation power of random initializations is unmatched by popular subspace sampling methods. Finally, we evaluate the relative effects of ensembling, subspace based methods and ensembles of subspace based methods, and the experimental results validate our hypothesis.},

	abstract = {Ensembling neural networks is an effective way to increase accuracy, and can often match the performance of larger models. This observation poses a natural question: given the choice between a deep ensemble and a single neural network with similar accuracy, is one preferable over the other? Recent work suggests that deep ensembles may offer benefits beyond predictive power: namely, uncertainty quantification and robustness to dataset shift. In this work, we demonstrate limitations to these purported benefits, and show that a single (but larger) neural network can replicate these qualities. First, we show that ensemble diversity, by any metric, does not meaningfully contribute to an ensemble's ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) data, and that one can estimate ensemble diversity by measuring the relative improvement of a single larger model. Second, we show that the OOD performance afforded by ensembles is strongly determined by their in-distribution (InD) performance, and – in this sense – is not indicative of any "effective robustness". While deep ensembles are a practical way to achieve performance improvement (in agreement with prior work), our results show that they may be a tool of convenience rather than a fundamentally better model class.},

	abstract = {Particle accelerators support a wide array of scientific, industrial, and medical applications. To meet the needs of these applications, accelerator physicists rely heavily on detailed simulations of the complicated particle beam dynamics through the accelerator. One of the most computationally expensive and difficult-to-model effects is the impact of Coherent Synchrotron Radiation (CSR). As a beam travels through a curved trajectory (e.g. due to a bending magnet), it emits radiation that in turn interacts with the rest of the beam. At each step through the trajectory, the electromagnetic field introduced by CSR (called the CSR wakefield) needs to computed and used when calculating the updates to the positions and momenta of every particle in the beam. CSR is one of the major drivers of growth in the beam emittance, which is a key metric of beam quality that is critical in many applications. The CSR wakefield is very computationally intensive to compute with traditional electromagnetic solvers, and this is a major limitation in accurately simulating accelerators. Here, we demonstrate a new approach for the CSR wakefield computation using a neural network solver structured in a way that is readily generalizable to new setups. We validate its performance by adding it to a standard beam tracking test problem and show a ten-fold speedup along with high accuracy.},

	abstract = {The production of electron bunches with low transverse emittance approaches the thermal emittance of the photocathode as various aberrations are corrected. Recently, the coupled-transverse-dynamics aberration was theoretically identified as a significant source of emittance growth, and a corrector magnet was proposed for its elimination [Phys. Rev. Accel. Beams 21, 010101 (2018)]. This aberration arises when the beam acquires an asymmetric distribution that is then rotated with respect to the transverse reference axis, thus introducing a correlation in the vertical and horizontal planes. The asymmetry is introduced by a weak quadrupole field in the rf gun or emittance compensation solenoid and the rotation is caused by the solenoid. This manuscript presents an experimental study of the coupled-transverse-dynamics aberration in an rf photoinjector and demonstrates its elimination by a quadrupole corrector consisting of a normal and a skew quadrupole. The experimental results agree well with theoretical predictions and numerical simulations, showing that the corrected emittance could reach the thermal value for an electron bunch with a low charge and a short length.},

	abstract = {Ultrafast electron diffraction (UED) is a technique in which short-pulse electron beams can probe the femtosecond-scale evolution of atomic structure in matter driven far from equilibrium. As an accelerator physics challenge, UED imposes stringent constraints on the brightness of the probe electron beam. The low normalized emittance employed in UED, often at the 10-nm scale and below, is particularly sensitive to both applied field aberrations and space-charge effects. The role of aberrations is increasingly important in small probe systems that often feature multiple orders of magnitude variations in beam size during transport. In this work, we report the correction of normal quadrupole, skew quadrupole, and sextupole aberrations via dedicated corrector elements in an ultrafast electron microdiffraction beamline. To do this, we generate precise four-dimensional phase space maps of rf-compressed electron beams and find excellent agreement with aberration-free space-charge simulations. Finally, we discuss the role a probe-forming aperture can play in improving the brightness of bunches with appreciable space-charge effects.},

In this work, we present an approach to deep learning for time-varying systems that does not require re-training, but uses instead an adaptive feedback in the architecture of deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). The feedback is based only on available system output measurements and is applied in the encoded low-dimensional dense layers of the encoder-decoder CNNs. First, we develop an inverse model of a complex accelerator system to map output beam measurements to input beam distributions, while both the accelerator components and the unknown input beam distribution vary rapidly with time. We then demonstrate our method on experimental measurements of the input and output beam distributions of the HiRES ultra-fast electron diffraction (UED) beam line at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, and showcase its ability for automatic tracking of the time varying photocathode quantum efficiency map. Our method can be successfully used to aid both physics and ML-based surrogate online models to provide non-invasive beam diagnostics.},

The uncorrelated electron energy spread in the LCLS can be increased by an order of magnitude to provide strong Landau damping against the instability without degrading the FEL performance. To this end, a “laser-heater” system has been installed in the LCLS injector, which modulates the energy of a 135-MeV electron bunch with an IR-laser beam in a short undulator, enclosed within a four-dipole chicane. In this paper, we report detailed measurements of laser-heater-induced energy spread, including the unexpected self-heating phenomenon when the laser energy is very low. We discuss the suppression of the microbunching instability with the laser heater and its impact on the x-ray FEL performance. We also present the analysis of these experimental results and develop a three-dimensional longitudinal space charge model to explain the self-heating effect.},

To design structures with high acceleration gradients, we explore the adjoint variable method, a highly efficient technique used to compute the sensitivity of an objective with respect to a large number of parameters. With this formalism, the sensitivity of the acceleration gradient of a dielectric structure with respect to its entire spatial permittivity distribution is calculated by the use of only two full-field electromagnetic simulations, the original and \&\#x02018;adjoint\&\#x02019;. The adjoint simulation corresponds physically to the reciprocal situation of a point charge moving through the accelerator gap and radiating. Using this formalism, we perform numerical optimizations aimed at maximizing acceleration gradients, which generate fabricable structures of greatly improved performance in comparison to previously examined geometries.},

The algorithmic challenge of cryo-EM is to jointly estimate the unknown 3D poses and the 3D electron scattering potential of a biomolecule from millions of extremely noisy 2D images. Existing reconstruction algorithms, however, cannot easily keep pace with the rapidly growing size of cryo-EM datasets due to their high computational and memory cost. We introduce cryoAI, an ab initio reconstruction algorithm for homogeneous conformations that uses direct gradient-based optimization of particle poses and the electron scattering potential from single-particle cryo-EM data. CryoAI combines a learned encoder that predicts the poses of each particle image with a physics-based decoder to aggregate each particle image into an implicit representation of the scattering potential volume. This volume is stored in the Fourier domain for computational efficiency and leverages a modern coordinate network architecture for memory efficiency. Combined with a symmetrized loss function, this framework achieves results of a quality on par with state-of-the-art cryo-EM solvers for both simulated and experimental data, one order of magnitude faster for large datasets and with significantly lower memory requirements than existing methods.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2211.01505},
	abstract = {Optical photons are used as signal in a wide variety of particle detectors. Modern neutrino experiments employ hundreds to tens of thousands of photon detectors to observe signal from millions to billions of scintillation photons produced from energy deposition of charged particles. These neutrino detectors are typically large, containing kilotons of target volume, with different optical properties. Modeling individual photon propagation in form of look-up table requires huge computational resources. As the size of a table increases with detector volume for a fixed resolution, this method scales poorly for future larger detectors. Alternative approaches such as fitting a polynomial to the model could address the memory issue, but results in poorer performance. Both look-up table and fitting approaches are prone to discrepancies between the detector simulation and the data collected. We propose a new approach using SIREN, an implicit neural representation with periodic activation functions, to model the look-up table as a 3D scene and reproduces the acceptance map with high accuracy. The number of parameters in our SIREN model is orders of magnitude smaller than the number of voxels in the look-up table. As it models an underlying functional shape, SIREN is scalable to a larger detector. Furthermore, SIREN can successfully learn the spatial gradients of the photon library, providing additional information for downstream applications. Finally, as SIREN is a neural network representation, it is differentiable with respect to its parameters, and therefore tunable via gradient descent. We demonstrate the potential of optimizing SIREN directly on real data, which mitigates the concern of data vs. simulation discrepancies. We further present an application for data reconstruction where SIREN is used to form a likelihood function for photon statistics.},

Here, we describe a heterogeneous reconstruction method based on an atomistic representation whose deformation is reduced to a handful of collective motions through normal mode analysis. Our implementation uses an autoencoder. The encoder jointly estimates the amplitude of motion along the normal modes and the 2D shift between the center of the image and the center of the molecule . The physics-based decoder aggregates a representation of the heterogeneity readily interpretable at the atomic level. We illustrate our method on 3 synthetic datasets corresponding to different distributions along a simulated trajectory of adenylate kinase transitioning from its open to its closed structures. We show for each distribution that our approach is able to recapitulate the intermediate atomic models with atomic-level accuracy.},

To meet these requirements, accelerator systems typically utilize dispersive elements to manipulate the correlated energy spread acquired during acceleration or via collective effects. The many free variables in these systems make finding an optimal configuration difficult. We present here an analytical method for tracking a desired final longitudinal phase space backwards through an accelerator section composed of an acceleration or drift section followed by a dispersive section, including analytical models of pertinent collective effects. This backtracking can serve as a fast and accurate tool for optimization and study of the longitudinal phase space dynamics of an accelerator system. Here, we consider the LCLS-II accelerator as an example case, using this method to find an accelerator configuration and longitudinal phase space at the injector exit that lead to a significant increase in peak current while maintaining a narrow energy spread at the accelerator exit. The validity of this method is tested by comparison with Elegant simulations, showing good agreement.},

	abstract = {This paper aims to create a transition path from file-based IO to streaming-based workflows for scientific applications in an HPC environment. By using the openPMP-api, traditional workflows limited by filesystem bottlenecks can be overcome and flexibly extended for in situ analysis. The openPMD-api is a library for the description of scientific data according to the Open Standard for Particle-Mesh Data (openPMD). Its approach towards recent challenges posed by hardware heterogeneity lies in the decoupling of data description in domain sciences, such as plasma physics simulations, from concrete implementations in hardware and IO. The streaming backend is provided by the ADIOS2 framework, developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This paper surveys two openPMD-based loosely-coupled setups to demonstrate flexible applicability and to evaluate performance. In loose coupling, as opposed to tight coupling, two (or more) applications are executed separately, e.g. in individual MPI contexts, yet cooperate by exchanging data. This way, a streaming-based workflow allows for standalone codes instead of tightly-coupled plugins, using a unified streaming-aware API and leveraging high-speed communication infrastructure available in modern compute clusters for massive data exchange. We determine new challenges in resource allocation and in the need of strategies for a flexible data distribution, demonstrating their influence on efficiency and scaling on the Summit compute system. The presented setups show the potential for a more flexible use of compute resources brought by streaming IO as well as the ability to increase throughput by avoiding filesystem bottlenecks.},

In fields such as physics and engineering, many processes are modeled with non-differentiable simulators with intractable likelihoods. Optimization of these forward models is particularly challenging, especially when the simulator is stochastic. To address such cases, we introduce the use of deep generative models to iteratively approximate the simulator in local neighborhoods of the parameter space. We demonstrate that these local surrogates can be used to approximate the gradient of the simulator, and thus enable gradient-based optimization of simulator parameters. In cases where the dependence of the simulator on the parameter space is constrained to a low dimensional submanifold, we observe that our method attains minima faster than baseline methods, including Bayesian optimization, numerical optimization and approaches using score function gradient estimators.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2209.04587},
	abstract = {Although beam emittance is critical for the performance of high-brightness accelerators, optimization is often time limited as emittance calculations, commonly done via quadrupole scans, are typically slow. Such calculations are a type of \${\textbackslash}textit\{multi-point query\}\$, i.e. each query requires multiple secondary measurements. Traditional black-box optimizers such as Bayesian optimization are slow and inefficient when dealing with such objectives as they must acquire the full series of measurements, but return only the emittance, with each query. We propose applying Bayesian Algorithm Execution (BAX) to instead query and model individual beam-size measurements. BAX avoids the slow multi-point query on the accelerator by acquiring points through a \${\textbackslash}textit\{virtual objective\}\$, i.e. calculating the emittance objective from a fast learned model rather than directly from the accelerator. Here, we use BAX to minimize emittance at the Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) and the Facility for Advanced Accelerator Experimental Tests II (FACET-II). In simulation, BAX is 20\${\textbackslash}times\$ faster and more robust to noise compared to existing methods. In live LCLS and FACET-II tests, BAX performed the first automated emittance tuning, matching the hand-tuned emittance at FACET-II and achieving a 24\% lower emittance at LCLS. Our method represents a conceptual shift for optimizing multi-point queries, and we anticipate that it can be readily adapted to similar problems in particle accelerators and other scientific instruments.},

The first is quadrupole focusing followed by beam rotation in a solenoid, and the second coupling comes from a skewed high-power rf coupler or cavity port which has a rotated rf quadrupole field. It is shown that a dc quadrupole field can correct for both types of couplings and exactly cancel their emittance growths.

	abstract = {The ever increasing demands placed upon machine performance have resulted in the need for more comprehensive particle accelerator modeling. Computer simulations are key to the success of particle accelerators. Many aspects of particle accelerators rely on computer modeling at some point, sometimes requiring complex simulation tools and massively parallel supercomputing. Examples include the modeling of beams at extreme intensities and densities (toward the quantum degeneracy limit), and with ultra-fine control (down to the level of individual particles). In the future, adaptively tuned models might also be relied upon to provide beam measurements beyond the resolution of existing diagnostics. Much time and effort has been put into creating accelerator software tools, some of which are highly successful. However, there are also shortcomings such as the general inability of existing software to be easily modified to meet changing simulation needs. In this paper possible mitigating strategies are discussed for issues faced by the accelerator community as it endeavors to produce better and more comprehensive modeling tools. This includes lack of coordination between code developers, lack of standards to make codes portable and/or reusable, lack of documentation, among others.},

An important feature of this code is the use of split-operator methods to integrate single-particle magnetic optics techniques with parallel PIC techniques. By choosing a splitting scheme that separates the self-fields from the complicated externally applied fields, we are able to utilize a large step size and still retain high accuracy. The method employed is symplectic and can be generalized to arbitrarily high order accuracy if desired. A two-dimensional parallel domain decomposition approach is employed within a message-passing programming paradigm along with a dynamic load balancing scheme. Performance tests on an SGI/Cray T3E-900 and an SGI Origin 2000 show good scalability of the object-oriented code.

	abstract = {Large deep learning models offer significant accuracy gains, but training billions to trillions of parameters is challenging. Existing solutions such as data and model parallelisms exhibit fundamental limitations to fit these models into limited device memory, while obtaining computation, communication and development efficiency. We develop a novel solution, Zero Redundancy Optimizer (ZeRO), to optimize memory, vastly improving training speed while increasing the model size that can be efficiently trained. ZeRO eliminates memory redundancies in data- and model-parallel training while retaining low communication volume and high computational granularity, allowing us to scale the model size proportional to the number of devices with sustained high efficiency. Our analysis on memory requirements and communication volume demonstrates: ZeRO has the potential to scale beyond 1 Trillion parameters using today's hardware. We implement and evaluate ZeRO: it trains large models of over 100B parameter with super-linear speedup on 400 GPUs, achieving throughput of 15 Petaflops. This represents an 8x increase in model size and 10x increase in achievable performance over state-of-the-art. In terms of usability, ZeRO can train large models of up to 13B parameters (e.g., larger than Megatron GPT 8.3B and T5 11B) without requiring model parallelism which is harder for scientists to apply. Last but not the least, researchers have used the system breakthroughs of ZeRO to create the world's largest language model (Turing-NLG, 17B parameters) with record breaking accuracy.},

Depending on the nature and arrangement of the available data, we devise two distinct types of algorithms, namely continuous time and discrete time models. The first type of models forms a new family of data-efficient spatio-temporal function approximators, while the latter type allows the use of arbitrarily accurate implicit Runge–Kutta time stepping schemes with unlimited number of stages. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a collection of classical problems in fluids, quantum mechanics, reaction–diffusion systems, and the propagation of nonlinear shallow-water waves.},

	abstract = {Advances in computational science offer a principled pipeline for predictive modeling of cardiovascular flows and aspire to provide a valuable tool for monitoring, diagnostics and surgical planning. Such models can be nowadays deployed on large patient-specific topologies of systemic arterial networks and return detailed predictions on flow patterns, wall shear stresses, and pulse wave propagation. However, their success heavily relies on tedious pre-processing and calibration procedures that typically induce a significant computational cost, thus hampering their clinical applicability. In this work we put forth a machine learning framework that enables the seamless synthesis of non-invasive in-vivo measurement techniques and computational flow dynamics models derived from first physical principles. We illustrate this new paradigm by showing how one-dimensional models of pulsatile flow can be used to constrain the output of deep neural networks such that their predictions satisfy the conservation of mass and momentum principles. Once trained on noisy and scattered clinical data of flow and wall displacement, these networks can return physically consistent predictions for velocity, pressure and wall displacement pulse wave propagation, all without the need to employ conventional simulators. A simple post-processing of these outputs can also provide a relatively cheap and effective way for estimating Windkessel model parameters that are required for the calibration of traditional computational models. The effectiveness of the proposed techniques is demonstrated through a series of prototype benchmarks, as well as a realistic clinical case involving in-vivo measurements near the aorta/carotid bifurcation of a healthy human subject.},

We demonstrate that our algorithm accurately reconstructs detailed 4D phase space distributions with corresponding confidence intervals in both simulation and experiment using a single focusing quadrupole and diagnostic screen.

The technique has gained popularity recently in the machine learning community due to its robustness and interpretability. The mathematical methods we discuss in this paper are an extension of the Gaussian-process framework. We are proposing advanced kernel designs that only allow for functions with certain desirable characteristics to be elements of the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) that underlies all kernel methods and serves as the sample space for Gaussian process regression. These desirable characteristics reflect the underlying physics; two obvious examples are symmetry and periodicity constraints. In addition, non-stationary kernel designs can be defined in the same framework to yield flexible multi-task Gaussian processes. We will show the impact of advanced kernel designs on Gaussian processes using several synthetic and two scientific data sets. The results show that including domain knowledge, communicated through advanced kernel designs, has a significant impact on the accuracy and relevance of the function approximation.},

On the other hand, massive potential gains in performance over standard, "experience-driven" layouts are in principle within our reach if an objective function fully aligned with the final goals of the instrument is maximized by means of a systematic search of the configuration space. The stochastic nature of the involved quantum processes make the modeling of these systems an intractable problem from a classical statistics point of view, yet the construction of a fully differentiable pipeline and the use of deep learning techniques may allow the simultaneous optimization of all design parameters. In this document we lay down our plans for the design of a modular and versatile modeling tool for the end-to-end optimization of complex instruments for particle physics experiments as well as industrial and medical applications that share the detection of radiation as their basic ingredient.

	abstract = {Thermal emittance and quantum efficiency (QE) are key figures of merit of photocathodes, and their uniformity is critical to high-performance photoinjectors. Several QE mapping technologies have been successfully developed; however, there is still a dearth of information on thermal emittance maps. This is because of the extremely time-consuming procedure to gather measurements by scanning a small beam across the cathode with fine steps. To simplify the mapping procedure and to reduce the time required to take measurements, we propose a new method that requires only a single scan of the solenoid current to simultaneously obtain thermal emittance and QE distribution by using a pattern beam with multiple beamlets. In this paper, its feasibility has been confirmed by both beam dynamics simulation and theoretical analysis. The method has been successfully demonstrated in a proof-of-principle experiment using an L-band radio-frequency photoinjector with a cesium telluride cathode. In the experiment, seven beamlets were generated from a microlens array system and their corresponding thermal emittance and QE varied from 0.93 to 1.14 μm/mm and from 4.6\% to 8.7\%, respectively. We also discuss the limitations and future improvements of the method in this paper.},

The mask shapes the bunch’s horizontal profile, and the EEX beam line converts it to a corresponding longitudinal profile. The Argonne wakefield accelerator rf photoinjector delivers electron bunches into a LBS beam line to generate a variety of longitudinal bunch shapes.

Recently, considerable efforts are being invested in comparing these techniques at different synchrotron radiation sources and colliders. An emerging class of less invasive techniques based on the optimization of performance-related observables is demonstrating a great potential.

The 15 GeV electron trajectory within the undulator must be straight to ∼5μm over a gain length of 11 m so that the photon beam overlaps efficiently with the electron beam. This alignment precision is not achievable with available mechanical survey methods. For this reason, an empirical beam-based alignment technique is developed that uses BPM readings in conjuntion with large, deliberate variations in the electron energy. We describe here a detailed alignment simulation including BPM and magnet-mover calibration errors, quadrupole gradient errors, and dipole field errors which demonstrate that the alignment can be achieved with high confidence.},

PINNs are nowadays used to solve PDEs, fractional equations, integral-differential equations, and stochastic PDEs. This novel methodology has arisen as a multi-task learning framework in which a NN must fit observed data while reducing a PDE residual. This article provides a comprehensive review of the literature on PINNs: while the primary goal of the study was to characterize these networks and their related advantages and disadvantages. The review also attempts to incorporate publications on a broader range of collocation-based physics informed neural networks, which stars form the vanilla PINN, as well as many other variants, such as physics-constrained neural networks (PCNN), variational hp-VPINN, and conservative PINN (CPINN). The study indicates that most research has focused on customizing the PINN through different activation functions, gradient optimization techniques, neural network structures, and loss function structures. Despite the wide range of applications for which PINNs have been used, by demonstrating their ability to be more feasible in some contexts than classical numerical techniques like Finite Element Method (FEM), advancements are still possible, most notably theoretical issues that remain unresolved.},

To this end, we employ the physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and its extended version, extended PINNs (XPINNs), where domain decomposition allows to deploy locally powerful neural networks in each subdomain, which can provide additional expressivity in subdomains, where a complex solution is expected. Apart from the governing compressible Euler equations, we also enforce the entropy conditions in order to obtain viscosity solutions. Moreover, we enforce positivity conditions on density and pressure. We consider inverse problems involving two-dimensional expansion waves, two-dimensional oblique and bow shock waves. We compare solutions obtained by PINNs and XPINNs and invoke some theoretical results that can be used to decide on the generalization errors of the two methods.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Simulating convective heat transfer using traditional numerical methods requires explicit definition of thermal boundary conditions on all boundaries of the domain, which is almost impossible to fulfill in real applications. Here, we address this ill-posed problem using machine learning techniques by assuming that we have some extra measurements of the temperature at a few locations in the domain, not necessarily located on the boundaries with the unknown thermal boundary condition. In particular, we employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to represent the velocity and temperature fields while simultaneously enforce the Navier-Stokes and energy equations at random points in the domain. In PINNs, all differential operators are computed using automatic differentiation, hence avoiding discretization in either space or time. The loss function is composed of multiple terms, including the mismatch in the velocity and temperature data, the boundary and initial conditions, as well as the residuals of the Navier-Stokes and energy equations. Here, we develop a data-driven strategy based on PINNs to infer the temperature field in the prototypical problem of convective heat transfer in flow past a cylinder. We assume that we have just a couple of temperature measurements on the cylinder surface and a couple more temperature measurements in the wake region, but the thermal boundary condition on the cylinder surface is totally unknown. Upon training the PINN, we can discover the unknown boundary condition while simultaneously infer the temperature field everywhere in the domain with less than 5\% error in the Nusselt number prediction. In order to assess the performance of PINN, we carried out a high fidelity simulation of the same heat transfer problem (with known thermal boundary conditions) by using the high-order spectral/hp-element method (SEM), and quantitatively evaluated the accuracy of PINN’s prediction with respect to SEM. We also propose a method to adaptively select the location of sensors in order to minimize the number of required temperature measurements while increasing the accuracy of the inference in heat transfer.},

These effects are included in the accelerator design via self-consistent multiparticle tracking simulations.

In this paper, we propose a differentiable self-consistent space-charge simulation model that enables the study of such sensitivity through only one simulation. This model differs from previous applications of the truncated power series algebra by connecting the beam properties directly with the accelerator design parameters in the presence of collective space-charge effects so that the local derivative of the beam properties with respect to the design parameters can be computed during the simulation. Such a model can also be used with gradient-based numerical optimizers for accelerator design optimizations including the self-consistent space-charge effects.},

	abstract = {FACET-II, the Facility for Advanced Accelerator Experimental Tests II, is a new accelerator R\&D test facility to be constructed at SLAC. It will provide high-energy, high-density electron and positron beams to advance the development of beam driven plasma wakefield acceleration and support a broad range of experiments. The FACET-II beams are expected to have 10 GeV energy, contain 2 nC of charge, have a transverse normalized emittance of 7 microns, be compressed to about 1 micron long and focused to about 6 micron wide at the interaction point. Additionally, the nominal peak current is 20 kA and is expected to fluctuate up to 200 kA. Most experiments desire complete knowledge of the incoming beam parameters on a pulse-to-pulse basis. However, the extreme beam densities and strong fields of the beam current will destroy any diagnostics intercepting the beam in a single shot and impose unique challenges for beam diagnostics. Moreover, non-intercepting diagnostics are desirable to provide feedback for machine setup and characterization. Finally, we need to look beyond conventional diagnostics to seek new solutions for measurements of the high charge, small beam size, short bunch length, and low emittance.},

We present a prototype diagnostic and correction scheme for controlling and determining laser focal position at 10 s of Hz rate by utilizing fast wavefront sensor measurements from multiple positions to train a focal position predictor. This predictor is used to determine corrections for actuators along the beamline to provide the desired correction to the focal position on millisecond timescales. Our initial proof-of-principle demonstrations leverage pre-compiled data and pre-trained networks operating ex-situ from the laser system. We then discuss the application of a high-level synthesis framework for generating a low-level hardware description of ML-based correction algorithms on FPGA hardware coupled directly to the beamline. Lastly, we consider the use of remote computing resources, such as the Sirepo scientific framework* , to actively update these correction schemes and deploy models to a production environment.},

ML studies on this topic, which were initially based on simulations, were successfully transferred to real accelerator operation at the 1.5-GeV electron storage ring of the DELTA accelerator facility. For this purpose, classical fully connected multi-layer feed-forward NNs were trained by supervised learning on measured orbit data to apply local and global beam position corrections. The supervised NN training was carried out with various conjugate gradient backpropagation learning algorithms. Afterwards, the ML-based orbit correction performance was compared with a conventional, numerical-based computing method. Here, the ML-based approach showed a competitive orbit correction quality in a fewer number of correction steps.},

While many off-the-shelf optimization algorithms are available, in practice their use is limited because most methods do not account for safety-critical constraints in each iteration, such as loss signals or step-size limitations. One notable exception is safe Bayesian optimization, which is a data-driven tuning approach for global optimization with noisy feedback. We propose and evaluate a step-size limited variant of safe Bayesian optimization on two research facilities of the PSI: (a) the SwissFEL and (b) HIPA. We report promising experimental results on both machines, tuning up to 16 parameters subject to 224 constraints.},

To investigate this approach, continuous model-free reinforcement learning with up to 16 degrees of freedom was developed and successfully tested at various facilities at CERN. The approach and algorithms used are discussed and the results obtained for trajectory steering at the AWAKE electron line and LINAC4 are presented.

	abstract = {Beam parameter optimization in accelerators involves multiple, sometimes competing, objectives. Condensing these individual objectives into a single figure of merit unavoidably results in a bias towards particular outcomes, often in an undesired way in the absence of prior knowledge. Finding an optimal objective definition then requires operators to iterate over many possible objective weights and definitions, a process that can take many times longer than the optimization itself. A more versatile approach is multi-objective optimization, which establishes the trade-off curve or Pareto front between objectives. Here we present the first results on multi-objective Bayesian optimization of a simulated laser-plasma accelerator. We find that multi-objective optimization reaches comparable performance to its single-objective counterparts while allowing for instant evaluation of entirely new objectives. This dramatically reduces the time required to find appropriate objective definitions for new problems. Additionally, our multi-objective, multi-fidelity method reduces the time required for an optimization run by an order of magnitude. It does so by dynamically choosing simulation resolution and box size, requiring fewer slow and expensive simulations as it learns about the Pareto-optimal solutions from fast low-resolution runs. The techniques demonstrated in this paper can easily be translated into many different computational and experimental use cases beyond accelerator optimization.},

We apply a physics-informed Gaussian process (GP) optimizer to tune a complex system. Typical GP models learn from past observations to make predictions, but this reduces their applicability to systems where there is limited relevant archive data. Instead, here we use a fast approximate model from physics simulations to design the GP model. The GP is then employed to make inferences from sequential online observations in order to optimize the system. Simulation and experimental studies were carried out to demonstrate the method for online control of a storage ring. Our method is a simple prescription to construct a custom GP model, including correlations between the high-dimensional input space, while encoding the physical response of a system. The ability to inform the machine-learning model with physics, without relying on the availability and range of prior data, may have wide applications in science.},
