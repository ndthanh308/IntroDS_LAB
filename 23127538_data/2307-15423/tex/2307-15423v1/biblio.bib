  title     = "Approximation of high-dimensional parametric {PDEs} *",
  author    = "Cohen, Albert and DeVore, Ronald",
  abstract  = "Parametrized families of PDEs arise in various contexts such as
               inverse problems, control and optimization, risk assessment, and
               uncertainty quantification. In most of these applications, the
               number of parameters is large or perhaps even infinite. Thus,
               the development of numerical methods for these parametric
               problems is faced with the possible curse of dimensionality.
               This article is directed at (i) identifying and understanding
               which properties of parametric equations allow one to avoid this
               curse and (ii) developing and analysing effective numerical
               methods which fully exploit these properties and, in turn, are
               immune to the growth in dimensionality. Part I of this article
               studies the smoothness and approximability of the solution map,
               that is, the map $a\mapsto u(a)$ , where $a$ is the parameter
               value and $u(a)$ is the corresponding solution to the PDE. It is
               shown that for many relevant parametric PDEs, the parametric
               smoothness of this map is typically holomorphic and also highly
               anisotropic, in that the relevant parameters are of widely
               varying importance in describing the solution. These two
               properties are then exploited to establish convergence rates of
               $n$ -term approximations to the solution map, for which each
               term is separable in the parametric and physical variables.
               These results reveal that, at least on a theoretical level, the
               solution map can be well approximated by discretizations of
               moderate complexity, thereby showing how the curse of
               dimensionality is broken. This theoretical analysis is carried
               out through concepts of approximation theory such as best $n$
               -term approximation, sparsity, and $n$ -widths. These notions
               determine a priori the best possible performance of numerical
               methods and thus serve as a benchmark for concrete algorithms.
               Part II of this article turns to the development of numerical
               algorithms based on the theoretically established sparse
               separable approximations. The numerical methods studied fall
               into two general categories. The first uses polynomial
               expansions in terms of the parameters to approximate the
               solution map. The second one searches for suitable
               low-dimensional spaces for simultaneously approximating all
               members of the parametric family. The numerical implementation
               of these approaches is carried out through adaptive and greedy
               algorithms. An a priori analysis of the performance of these
               algorithms establishes how well they meet the theoretical
               benchmarks.",

               algorithmic and implementation aspects, and highlights their

              models as a submanifold of probability densities equipped with
              the Wasserstein metric. The topology induced by optimal transport
              is highly desirable and natural because, in contrast to total
              variation and other metrics, the Wasserstein metric is weakly
              continuous (i.e., convergence is equivalent to convergence of
              moments). Thus, our approach provides natural ways to compare,
              interpolate and average Gaussian mixture models. Moreover, the
              approach has low computational complexity. Different aspects of

              realization of efficient reduced-order models based on linear

              purely data-driven methods that leverage autoencoders and their

               bottom line of most strategies has so far been based on the

  abstract  = "This thesis aims to be a contribution to numerical methods for
               ab initio molecular simulation, and more specifically for
               electronic structure calculations by means of the
               Schr{\"o}dingerequation or formalisms such as the Hartree-Fock
               theory or the Density Functional Theory. It puts forward a
               strategy to build mixed wavelet-Gaussian bases for the
               Galerkinapproximation, combining the respective advantages of
               these two types of bases in orderto better capture the cusps of
               the wave function.Numerous software programs are currently
               available to the chemists in this field (VASP,Gaussian,
               ABINIT... ) and differ from each other by various methodological
               choices,notably that of the basis functions used for expressing
               atomic orbitals. As a newcomer tothis market, the massively
               parallel BigDFT code has opted for a basis of wavelets. Dueto
               performance considerations, the number of multiresolution levels
               has been limited andtherefore users cannot benefit from the full
               potential of wavelets. The question is thus howto improve the
               accuracy of all-electron calculations in the neighborhood of the
               cusp-typesingularities of the solution, without excessively
               increasing the complexity of BigDFT.The answer we propose is to
               enrich the scaling function basis (low level of resolutionof the
               wavelet basis) by Gaussian functions centered on each nucleus
               position. The maindifficulty in constructing such a mixed basis
               lies in the optimal determination of the numberof Gaussians
               required and their standard deviations, so that these additional
               Gaussiansare compatible in the best possible way with the
               existing basis within the constraint of anerror threshold given
               in advance. We advocate the conjunction of an a posteriori
               estimateon the diminution of the energy level and a greedy
               algorithm, which results in a quasi-optimal incremental sequence
               of additional Gaussians. This idea is directly inspired bythe
               techniques of reduced bases.We develop the theoretical
               foundations of this strategy on two 1-D linear models thatare
               simplified versions of the Schr{\"o}dinger equation for one
               electron in an infinite domainor a periodic domain. These
               prototype models are investigated in depth in the firstpart. The
               definition of the a posteriori estimate as a residual dual norm,
               as well as theimplementation of the greedy philosophy into
               various concrete algorithms, are presented inthe second part,
               along with extensive numerical results. These algorithms allow
               for moreand more saving of CPU time and become more and more
               empirical, in the sense thatthey rely more and more on the
