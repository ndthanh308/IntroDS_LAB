\begin{abstract}
Topological defects in active polar fluids can organise spontaneous flows and influence macroscopic density patterns. Both of them play, for example, an important role during animal development. Yet the influence of density on active flows is poorly understood. Motivated by experiments on cell monolayers confined to discs, we study the coupling between density and polar order for a compressible active polar fluid in presence of a $+1$ topological defect. As in the experiments, we find a density-controlled spiral-to-aster transition. In addition, biphasic orientational phases emerge as a generic outcome of such coupling. Our results highlight the importance of density gradients as a potential mechanism for controlling flow and orientational patterns in biological systems.

%% Introduction %%
Active matter is composed of individual constituents able to extract energy from their local environment to produce mechanical work \cite{marchetti_hydrodynamics_2013,shankar_topological_2022}.
This feature gives rise to collective phenomena that play an important role in many biological systems, such as the emergence of polar flocking, motility-induced phase separation or spontaneous flows \cite{marchetti_hydrodynamics_2013,shankar_topological_2022}. For instance, spontaneous flows generated by gradients of active stress have been observed in various systems, including cytoskeleton assays \cite{nedelec_self-organization_1997,schaller_polar_2010,opathalage_self-organized_2019}, or multicellular ensembles \cite{siegert_spiral_1995,kawaguchi_topological_2017,saw_topological_2017,duclos_spontaneous_2018,streichan_global_2018}.
%For instance, emergent coherent motion or chaotic flows at low-Reynolds numbers were identified in various systems, including cytoskeleton assays \cite{nedelec_self-organization_1997,schaller_polar_2010,opathalage_self-organized_2019}, bacterial colonies \cite{wioland_confinement_2013,genkin_topological_2017,you_confinement-induced_2021}, cell monolayers \cite{kawaguchi_topological_2017,blanch-mercader_turbulent_2018,duclos_spontaneous_2018,guillamat_integer_2022}, or eukaryotic organisms \cite{siegert_spiral_1995,tennenbaum_mechanics_2016,deblais_phase_2020}.
%Despite their inherent biological diversity, all these systems organize into phases with macroscopic orientational order, separated by interfaces where topological defects arise.
All these systems can organize into out-of-equilibrium phases with domains featuring orientational order. This order can locally be disrupted by disclinations, often called topological defects, which are associated with rotational flow patterns~\cite{doostmohammadi_active_2018,shankar_topological_2022,leclech_physiological_2023}. %doostomohammadi_physics_2022 ?

Both, theoretical and experimental studies have demonstrated that the interplay between topological defects and active processes concentrates mechanical stress, leading to the formation of density gradients \cite{giomi_defect_2014,saw_topological_2017,kawaguchi_topological_2017,turiv_topology_2020,endresen_topological_2021,brezin_spontaneous_2022,guillamat_integer_2022,kaiyrbekov_migration_2023}.
%This interplay ultimately causes either cell aggregation or depletion at the defect center, depending on the defects charge.
Reciprocally, cell density variations influence orientational order \cite{duclos_perfect_2014,blanch-mercader_quantifying_2021}. Given the growing recognition of topological defects as organizing centers during morphogenesis \cite{saw_topological_2017,kawaguchi_topological_2017,maroudas-sacks_topological_2021,guillamat_integer_2022}, understanding how density gradients and orientational order interact is essential.
%However, how density gradients influence macroscopic orientational order remains poorly understood. Given the growing recognition of topological defects as  organizing centers during morphogenesis \cite{saw_topological_2017,kawaguchi_topological_2017,maroudas-sacks_topological_2021,guillamat_integer_2022}, it is of importance to understand feedback effects between spatial density variations and collective motion.

%In particular, cell density was shown to control a flowing transition in polarized cell monolayers in vitro, confined on a disc and organised around a $+1$ topological defect \cite{guillamat_integer_2022}.
At low cell density, spontaneous rotational flows emerged in a spiral multicellular arrangement. Whereas for increasing cell density, a transition occurred to an aster arrangement without rotational flows, Fig.~\ref{fig1}a. Steeper cell density gradients were found for asters compared to spirals, Fig.~\ref{fig1}b.
% theoretical context
In the hydrodynamic description of an incompressible active polar fluid, an aster-to-spiral transition arises from the competition between the active stress and orientational elasticity \cite{kruse_asters_2004}.
The transition corresponds to a spontaneous flow instability \cite{voituriez_spontaneous_2005,giomi_complex_2008,furthauer_taylorcouette_2012,shendruk_dancing_2017}, where density does not appear explicitly as a control parameter.

%To understand the influence of density variations near topological defects in active polar fluids
In this Letter, we study a coupling between density gradients and orientational order, in the case of $+1$ topological defects in confined active polar fluids, Fig.~\ref{fig1}d. In spreading cell monolayers, this Density-Polarity Coupling (DPC) expresses a tendency of cells to polarize away from high density regions \cite{streichan_spatial_2014,heinrich_size-dependent_2020,alert_physical_2020}.
%This Density-Polarity Coupling (DPC) alludes to the outward migration of cells in spreading monolayers, where inward density gradients are measured at the edge \cite{streichan_spatial_2014,heinrich_size-dependent_2020,alert_physical_2020}.
First, we identify conditions for a density-controlled spiral-to-aster transition. Second, we show that biphasic orientational phases are a generic feature of compressible polar fluids. Finally, we discuss the relevance of DPC for monolayers of polarized cells.

%\textbf{Theoretical description. }
To describe a two-dimensional compressible active polar fluid, we use active gel theory \cite{kruse_asters_2004,julicher_hydrodynamic_2018}. The system is characterised by velocity $\bm{v}(\bm{r},t)$, polarity $\bm{p}(\bm{r},t)$ and particle density $n=n_0\bar{n}(\bm{r},t)$ fields, where $n_0$ is the preferred particle density, Fig.~\ref{fig1}c.

The equilibrium physics is captured by an effective free energy $\mathcal{F}=\int_A\mathrm{d}A\,f$ with free-energy density
\begin{equation}\label{eq-ftot}
f=\frac{B}{2}\left(1-\bar{n}\right)^2+\frac{G}{2}|\bm{\nabla}\bar{n}|^2+\frac{K}{2}|\bm{\nabla}\bm{p}|^2+\frac{\chi}{2}\bm{p}^2+f_{\rm DPC}.
\end{equation}
The first two terms penalize density variations with elastic coefficients $B,G>0$. The second two terms tend to suppress polarity variations with elastic coefficients $K,\chi>0$. Thus, we favour a disordered phase in the bulk. We use the one-constant approximation \cite{gennes_physics_1993} for simplicity and leave the general case for future studies.

The last term, $f_{\rm DPC}$, accounts for the coupling between density and polarity. The lowest order term in powers of $(\bm{p},\bm{\nabla}\bar{n})$ with polar symmetry reads
%The lowest coupling term in powers of $(\bm{p},\bm{\nabla}\bar{n})$ has a polar symmetry and reads
\begin{equation}\label{eq-fDPC}
f_{\rm DPC}=J_{\rm p}n_0(\bm{p}\cdot\bm{\nabla})\bar{n},
\end{equation}
which is related to a density-dependent spontaneous splay term of the Frank free energy \cite{frank_liquid_1958,gennes_physics_1993,alert_physical_2020}. Previous works identified a linear instability of an ordered state associated with this coupling \cite{kung_hydrodynamics_2006,voituriez_generic_2006,adar_active-gel_2022,adar_permeation_2021,ibrahimi_deforming_2023}.
%, and others considered a fixed coupling coefficient \cite{giomi_complex_2008,notbohm_cellular_2016}.
Negative (positive) values of the coupling coefficient $J_{\rm p}$ favor (anti-)alignment of polarity to density gradients, Fig.~\ref{fig1}d. From now on, we use $ J_{\rm p} n_0\equiv j_{\rm p}$ as control parameter.
%Note that in such dominant activity regime, one has $n-1\propto\bm{p}^2$ and the DPC term in Eq.~\ref{eq-fDPC} is analogous to a ferroelectric free energy term \cite{blankschtein_theory_1985}.

The evolution of the fields $\bar{n}$, $\bm{v}$ and $\bm{p}$ is determined by the continuity equation, the polarity dynamics and the local force balance:
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq-evo}
\begin{eqnarray}
\partial_t\bar{n}&=&-\partial_{\beta}(\bar{n} v_{\beta}) \\
D_tp_{\alpha}&=&\frac{h_{\alpha}}{\gamma}-\nu\left(v_{\alpha\beta}-\frac{1}{2}v_{\gamma\gamma}\delta_{\alpha\beta}\right)p_{\beta} \\
0&=&\partial_{\beta}(\sigma_{\alpha\beta}^{\rm e}+\sigma_{\alpha\beta}^{\rm d}),
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
where $\mathbf{h}=-\delta\mathcal{F}/\delta\bm{p}$ is the molecular field, $v_{\alpha\beta}=(\partial_{\alpha}v_{\beta}+\partial_{\beta}v_{\alpha})/2$, and $\omega_{\alpha\beta}=(\partial_{\alpha}v_{\beta}-\partial_{\beta}v_{\alpha})/2$ are the symmetric and anti-symmetric parts of the velocity gradient tensor, and $D_tp_{\alpha}=\partial_tp_{\alpha}+v_{\beta}\partial_{\beta}p_{\alpha}+\omega_{\alpha\beta}p_{\beta}$ is the co-rotational derivative.

%Note that we neglect here the effect of tissue-substrate interactions for simplicity to concentrate on the minimal necessary ingredients.
The stress is decomposed into the Ericksen and the deviatoric components that read
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq-stress}
\begin{eqnarray}
\sigma_{\alpha\beta}^{\rm e}&=&-P\delta_{\alpha\beta}-(G\partial_\beta\bar{n}+j_{\rm p}p_{\beta})\partial_\alpha\bar{n}-K\partial_\alpha p_\gamma \partial_\beta p_\gamma \\
\sigma_{\alpha\beta}^{\rm d}&=&2\eta\left(v_{\alpha\beta}-\frac{1}{2}v_{\gamma\gamma}\delta_{\alpha\beta}\right) \\ \nonumber
&+&\frac{\nu}{2}(p_{\alpha}h_{\beta}+p_{\beta}h_{\alpha}-p_{\gamma}h_{\gamma}\delta_{\alpha\beta})+\frac{1}{2}(p_{\alpha}h_{\beta}-p_{\beta}h_{\alpha}) \\ \nonumber
&-&\frac{1}{2}\zeta_0\Delta\mu p_{\gamma}p_{\gamma}\delta_{\alpha\beta}-\zeta\Delta\mu\left(p_{\alpha}p_{\beta}-\frac{1}{2}p_{\gamma}p_{\gamma}\delta_{\alpha\beta}\right)
\end{eqnarray}
\end{subequations}
with the pressure $P=\mu\bar{n}-f$, the chemical potential $\mu=\delta \mathcal{F}/\delta \bar{n}$ and $\Delta\mu$ is the chemical potential difference extracted from fuel consumption. The phenomenological parameters are the rotational viscosity $\gamma$, the flow alignment coefficient $\nu$, the shear viscosity $\eta$, and the active isotropic (anisotropic) coefficient $\zeta_0$ ($\zeta$).

As in the experimental system of Ref.~\cite{guillamat_integer_2022}, we consider an active fluid confined to a disc of radius $R$, Fig.~\ref{fig1}c. Using polar coordinates $(r,\theta)$, the polarity field is decomposed into the polar order $S$ and the tilt angle $\psi$ with respect to the radial direction, so that $\bm{p}=S\cos\psi\,\mathbf{e}_r+S\sin\psi\,\mathbf{e}_{\theta}$, where $\mathbf{e}_r$ and $\mathbf{e}_\theta$ are the unit polar vectors. In addition we assume rotational invariance, $\partial_{\theta}=0$. Because our theoretical description is achiral, without loss of generality, we restrict the range of angles to $\psi=[0,\pi]$. Using the convention that outward polarity corresponds to $\psi<\pi/2$, one can classify the different $+1$ topological defects into out-aster $\psi=0$, out-spiral $0<\psi<\pi/2$, vortex $\psi=\pi/2$, in-spiral $\pi/2<\psi<\pi$ and in-aster $\psi=\pi$.

The evolution equations for the fields $\bar{n}$, $S$, $\psi$, $v_r$ and $v_{\theta}$ are detailed in Supplementary Material (SM) \cite{supp_mater}. Motivated by the experiments in \cite{guillamat_integer_2022}, spatial boundary conditions at $r=R$ are set to $S=1$ (boundary-induced order), $\partial_r\psi=0$ (free orientation), $v_r=0$ (absence of particle flux), and $\sigma_{\theta r}=0$ (absence of shear stress). At equilibrium, the last boundary condition at $r=R$ is obtained from the minimization of the free energy \eqref{eq-ftot}, which yields $\partial_r\bar{n}=-j_{\rm p}\cos\psi/G$. We assume that this condition also holds out-of-equilibrium. 
%The $f_{\rm DPC}$ term \eqref{eq-fDPC} generates a non-trivial equilibrium condition for the density gradient at $r=R$: $\partial_r\bar{n}=-j_{\rm p}\cos\psi/G$.
At $r=0$, regularity of the solution imposes that $S=\partial_r\psi=\partial_r\bar{n}=v_r=v_{\theta}=0$. 

Parameters are non-dimensionalized by using disc radius $R$ as length scale, Frank constant $K$ as energy scale and rotational viscosity $\gamma$ to obtain a time scale $\gamma R^2/K$. In the following, $B=12$, $G=2$, $\eta=2$, $\nu=-1.5$ are fixed, and $\chi$, $j_{\rm p}$, $\zeta\Delta\mu$, $\zeta_0\Delta\mu$ are varied. In numerics, the initial polarity is oriented outwards (i.e. $\psi(r,t=0)<\pi/2$), and the total particle density $\int_A\mathrm{d}A\,n/A$ is set to $n_0$ to avoid any pre-stress in the uniform configuration. For more details on the numerical scheme and initial conditions, see SM \cite{supp_mater}.
%Particle number conservation \eqref{eq-evo} imposes the constraint $\int_A\mathrm{d}A\,\bar{n}=A$, where we ignore any pre-stress in the uniform configuration by setting the total particle density equal to $n_0$.

%\textbf{Results. }
First, we consider the case of vanishing activity $\zeta\Delta\mu=\zeta_0\Delta\mu=0$. In this case, the equilibrium states are in- and out- asters, Fig.~\ref{fig2}a, which have the same total energy and are selected through spontaneous symmetry breaking. The corresponding density gradients have opposite signs, see SM \cite{supp_mater}.
%Here, DPC orients the polarity field according to the direction of density gradients. Because density gradients are radial under rotational invariance, in- and out-asters are reached at steady-state by a symmetry breaking process for $|j_{\rm p}|>0$, Fig.~\ref{fig2}a and SM \cite{supp_mater}.

Next, in the case of vanishing DPC $j_{\rm p}=0$, spontaneous flows occur when $\zeta\Delta\mu>0$, Fig.~\ref{fig2}. Specifically, in- and out-asters transition to rotating spirals when anisotropic activity switches from contractile $\zeta\Delta\mu<0$ to extensile $\zeta\Delta\mu>0$, Fig.~\ref{fig2}a-c. Unlike in past works \cite{kruse_asters_2004,voituriez_spontaneous_2005}, here the instability threshold vanishes because of the absence of boundary anchoring. Spirals feature counter-rotating flows with a vanishing net torque because forces are internal, see Fig.~\ref{fig2}b. Their steady-state orientation angle $\psi(r)=\psi_L$ satisfies the relation $\nu\cos(2\psi_L)=1$ \cite{leslie_constitutive_1968}, where $\psi_L$ is the Leslie angle, see Fig.~\ref{fig2}c. Gradients of density are sustained by active processes in both spirals and asters, with their direction set by $\bar{n}'\sim-(\zeta\cos(2\psi)+\zeta_0)\Delta\mu$ for uniform $\psi$ \cite{blanch-mercader_integer_2021}, see Fig.~\ref{fig2}d for an extensile spiral.

Based on the above results, when $j_{\rm p}\neq 0$ and $\zeta\Delta\mu>0$, we expect competition between DPC, promoting radial configurations, and the active anisotropic stress driving the polarity towards the Leslie angle. Solving numerically our hydrodynamic equations \eqref{eq-evo}, a spiral-to-aster transition is found at a threshold value of $j_{\rm p}$, Fig.~\ref{fig2}a and c. As $|j_{\rm p}|$ increases near the threshold value, density gradients become steeper and the angle $\psi$ approaches zero as for the out-aster state thanks to DPC, Fig.~\ref{fig2}c,d. In contrast, the polar order parameter remains approximately independent of $j_{\rm p}$, Fig.~\ref{fig2}e. Importantly, this transition now occurs at a finite threshold of activity, Fig.~\ref{fig2}a.
% discuss the asymmetry of the threshold for NL results and refer to SI section ?

To further understand this competition, we analysed the linear stability of an out-aster to perturbations in the angle $\psi$, see SM \cite{supp_mater}. Neglecting gradients of orientation Fig.~\ref{fig2}c, the linear dynamics for the angle perturbation $\delta\psi$ reduces to 
\begin{equation}\label{eq-aster}
\partial_t\delta\psi\propto\left\{j_{\rm p}\bar{n}_{\rm a}'+\frac{2\zeta\Delta\mu\gamma(1-\nu)S_{\rm a}^3}{4\eta+\gamma S_{\rm a}^2(\nu-1)^2}\right\}\delta\psi
\end{equation}
where $S_{\rm a}(r)$ and $\bar{n}_{\rm a}(r)$ are, respectively, the steady-state polar order and reduced density for an out-aster. Assuming that the instability originates from the boundary, we replace these profiles by their boundary values $S_{\rm a}=1$ and $\bar{n}_{\rm a}'=-j_{\rm p}/G$ in Eq.~\eqref{eq-aster} and obtain the analytical threshold
\begin{equation}\label{eq-threshold}
|j_{\rm p}^{*}|=\sqrt{\frac{2\zeta\Delta\mu G\gamma(1-\nu)}{4\eta+\gamma(1-\nu)^2}}.
\end{equation}
This threshold suggests that an out-aster is linearly unstable for $\zeta\Delta\mu(1-\nu)>0$ and an intermediate range of the DPC coefficient $|j_{\rm p}|<|j_{\rm p}^{*}|$. Expression~\eqref{eq-threshold} is in qualitative agreement with numerics, Fig.~\ref{fig2}a. In conclusion, DPC can suppress the spontaneous flow transition and stabilise asters in active polar fluids.

%patterning. New phase was found that corresponds to gradients of angles with a sharp/smooth interface.
%Equilibrium, non-monotonic density profiles. 
%In combination with activity all possible phases are found. Mechanism?
Let us reconsider the equilibrium case. There, linear stability analysis shows that DPC alone can destabilize a uniform ordered state  \cite{kung_hydrodynamics_2006,voituriez_generic_2006,adar_active-gel_2022,adar_permeation_2021}. Indeed equilibration of density fluctuations leads to an effective Frank free-energy with a renormalized splay constant $K_{\rm s}=K-j_{\rm p}^2/B$, whereas the bend constant remains unchanged $K_{\rm b}=K$, see SM \cite{supp_mater}. For $K_{\rm s}<0$, that is above the threshold value $|j_{\rm p}^{\dagger}|=\sqrt{KB}$, splay distortions are favoured. In our system, the threshold for this instability $j_{\rm p}^{\dagger}$ is modified by activity and boundary conditions. The instability is associated with a finite wavelength, which can generate biphasic orientational phases in the context of $+1$ topological defects that we analyze in the following.
%When $G=0$ and in the bulk, minimization of the free energy \eqref{eq-ftot} with respect to $\bar{n}$ leads to a renormalized splay Frank constant $K_{\rm s}=K-j_{\rm p}^2/B$, whereas the bend Frank constant $K_{\rm b}$ remains unchanged, see SM \cite{supp_mater}. In this case, above the threshold value $j_{\rm p}>|j_{\rm p}^{\dagger}|=\sqrt{KB}$, free-energy minimization favours states with splay distortions, because $K_{\rm s}<0$. In past works \cite{kung_hydrodynamics_2006,voituriez_generic_2006}, it was already shown using linear stability analysis that DPC can destabilize a uniform ordered state at equilibrium. In our system, the threshold for this instability $j_{\rm p}^{\dagger}$ is modified by activity and boundary conditions. Here, we show that in the context of $+1$ topological defects, DPC generates two types of biphasic orientational patterns, named patterning and double spirals. 
%Furthermore, density patterning in the form of polar bands is expected because the DPC term (Eq.~\ref{eq-fDPC}) appears in an effective free energy of the Toner-Tu equations \cite{solon_phase_2015,fodor_statistical_2018}.

Beyond the spontaneous splay instability, biphasic asters emerge where in- and out-aster states coexist, Fig.~\ref{fig3}a. This state is characterised by a non-monotonic density profile, favouring non-uniform orientations due to DPC, Fig.~\ref{fig3}a, and a sharp interface with strong orientation gradients ($R|\boldsymbol{\nabla}\psi|\gg 1$). Because the positive bend constant $K_{\rm b}=K$ prevents large gradients of $\psi$, the polar order $S$ needs to be sufficiently small to stabilize the interface, Fig.~\ref{fig3}a, inset. This can be achieved in the disordered limit $\sqrt{K/\chi}\ll R$, such that polar order is localized at the disc periphery, see Fig.~\ref{fig3}a.

% double spiral, non-logarithmic spiral ?
Below the spontaneous splay instability, double spirals can be found. They are characterised by a gradual gradient of orientation ($R|\boldsymbol{\nabla}\psi|\sim 1$), Fig.~\ref{fig3}b. This gradient results from a competition between active alignment and DPC, modulated by the local amplitude of polar order $S$. Indeed, if anisotropic activity dominates over DPC at the periphery ($S\sim 1$), spirals are stabilised for $\zeta\Delta\mu>0$, Fig.~\ref{fig3}b. Away from the periphery, where order is weak ($S\ll 1$), DPC always dominates, favouring out-asters for inward density gradients, Fig.~\ref{fig3}b. Contrary to Fig.~\ref{fig2}c,e where polar order remains large near the center, locally attenuating the competition between active alignment and DPC, here the disordered limit $\sqrt{K/\chi}\ll R$ results in larger orientational gradients.

%Patterning is characterised by psi_r=0 and deltapsi=-\pi.
%psi_r\neq0 and detalpsi\neq 0
These states can be characterized by the peripheral angle $\psi_R=\psi(R)$ and the angle difference between the periphery and the center $\Delta\psi=\psi(R)-\psi(0)$. Whereas Fig.~\ref{fig3}d is apparently similar to Fig.~\ref{fig2}a, the state diagram for the angle difference in Fig.~\ref{fig3}e reveals biphasic asters and double spirals with $\Delta\psi\neq0$, SM \cite{supp_mater}. The dependence on activity of the spontaneous splay threshold can be understood from the non-monotonicity of density profiles, as in Fig.~\ref{fig3}a. Whereas density gradients $\bar{n}'(R)$ are set by DPC at the periphery, in the bulk, they scale as $\bar{n}'\sim-(\zeta+\zeta_0)\Delta\mu$ when activity dominates. Therefore, biphasic asters are favoured when $j_{\rm p}>0$ and $(\zeta+\zeta_0)\Delta\mu<0$ or vice-versa, in agreement with state $2$ in Fig.~\ref{fig3}e when $\zeta_0\Delta\mu=0$, or in Fig.~\ref{fig3}g when $\zeta_0\Delta\mu\neq0$.

At low values of $|j_{\rm p}|$, double spirals can emerge, states $4$, $6$ and $8$ in Fig.~\ref{fig3}e,g. Whereas peripheral orientation remains outward when $\zeta_0\Delta\mu=0$, Fig.~\ref{fig3}e, large isotropic activity can induce inward oriented states $7$ and $8$ in Fig.~\ref{fig3}f,g. These states can no longer be understood from peripheral angle dynamics alone. They appear when anisotropic active stresses overcome DPC at the periphery, in combination with outward (inward) bulk density gradients to promote inward orientation for $j_{\rm p}>0$ ($j_{\rm p}<0$). Increasing $\zeta_0\Delta\mu$ to positive values changes the direction of bulk density gradients, and reverses the central angle from inwards to outwards through the sequence of states $8\rightarrow 6\rightarrow 4$ for $j_{\rm p}>0$, see Fig.~\ref{fig3}c,g.

In summary, a local coupling between polarity and density gradients can account for the observed transition between rotating spirals and non-flowing asters as cell density increases, Fig.~\ref{fig1}. In addition, these results provide an alternative interpretation of this transition, in terms of a transition from a double spiral to an aster, black arrow in Fig.~\ref{fig3}g. In this case, for low densities, a double spiral with aster-like orientation $\psi\simeq 0$ in the center is found, Fig.~\ref{fig3}b,g. With increasing density, this inner phase expands until it fills the entire disc and the angle becomes $\psi=0$. This double-spiral state delays the relaxation of the peripheral angle towards zero, which is consistent with experiments, see \textit{appendix}.
%In addition, DPC can also account for the orientational dynamics reported in experiments, see \textit{appendix}.
%Because observed density gradients are inward for both spiral and aster states Fig.~\ref{fig1}b, one expects the parametric region $\zeta\Delta\mu,\zeta_0\Delta\mu,j_{\rm p}>0$ to be experimentally relevant. In this case, at low densities, a double spiral with aster-like orientation in the center is found, black arrow in Fig.~\ref{fig3}g. As density increases, the inner aster-like phase expands, until it invades the entire domain. Unlike for a transition with uniform orientation \cite{kruse_asters_2004}, this intermediate double-spiral state introduces a temporal delay for reorientation of the peripheral angle, which is consistent with the dynamics reported in experiments, see \textit{appendix}.

The spiral-to-aster transition discussed above crucially relies on the choice of the free energy term $f_{\rm DPC}$ (Eq.~\ref{eq-fDPC}). Alternatively, it can be written as $f_{\rm DPC}=-j_{\rm p}\bar{n}\boldsymbol{\nabla}\cdot\boldsymbol{p}$, which leads to the equilibrium BC $\partial_r\bar{n}(R)=0$. In SM \cite{supp_mater}, we show that the main results remain unchanged for different parameter values. One could also consider a free energy of the form $\tilde{f}_{\rm DPC}=J_{\rm p}(\bm{p}\cdot\bm{\nabla})n/n_0$ \cite{kung_hydrodynamics_2006,giomi_complex_2008,notbohm_cellular_2016}. In this case, a density-controlled spiral-to-aster transition occurs if $\zeta\Delta\mu$ decreases with density. Then, other parameters like isotropic active stress also need to depend on density to match the observed density profiles in Fig.~\ref{fig1}b. Therefore, Eq.~\ref{eq-fDPC} corresponds to a minimal extension of Ref.~\cite{blanch-mercader_quantifying_2021}.

DPC not only provides an explanation for the dynamics of polar tissues on discs, Fig.~\ref{fig1}, but also proposes a mechanism for collective states found in giant epithelial cell monolayers \cite{heinrich_size-dependent_2020}. There, a radially spreading tissue develops azimuthal flows in the central region, and density gradients become non-monotonic. In our framework, this state resembles biphasic asters except for an outward spiral orientation near the center in Ref.~\cite{heinrich_size-dependent_2020}. We expect this difference to originate from a global polar order, which is able to sustain bulk active stresses contrary to our disordered system. Validation of these hypotheses requires a precise measurement of the cell polarity field and complementary theoretical analysis.

To our knowledge, the above experimental works represent the first evidences of DPC in cellular systems. To further investigate this coupling experimentally, one could control density gradients using optogenetic tools \cite{gligorovski_multidimensional_2023} and generate specific flow or polarity patterns. Although we have focused on systems with polar symmetry, it is also interesting to consider couplings between density gradients and other types of orientational order, like nematic systems \cite{wang_patterning_2023}.
%Our study emphasizes the potential importance of cell density variations to control collective migration \cite{poleo_cell_2001,heinrich_size-dependent_2020} or morphological \cite{farrell_mechanically_2013,palmquist_reciprocal_2022} events in biological systems.

%Finally, such coupling between density and polarity can be easily extended to nematic systems with $f_{Q}=J_{\rm Q}(\bm{\nabla}n)\cdot\mathbf{Q}\cdot(\bm{\nabla}n)$ as recently discussed in the context of Hydra \cite{wang_patterning_2023}.

%Some ideas:
% be careful with the impact of tractions on the spiral-aster transition
% can explain spiral-aster transition with a simple \xi(n) rule?? Enrichment of FAs over time? No data.
% \zeta_0 varies ?
%account for cell proliferation through a quasi-static shift of preferred density $n_0$.

% patterning of order in MTs [ref arxiv] ?

%Find a good experimental predictor of the model!
%\textbf{In Duclos paper as in Pau's experiments, they observe a convergent flow of cells from stripe boundary to center. However, it is not clear if steady density gradients occur because cell extrusion appears in center... Another difference with Pau's system is the (likely) absence of polar order at boundaries: if p was somehow slaved to v this would cost high distortion energy? DPC mechanism for such geometry would favor normal orientation without much disorder at the center, this would cost a lot because polarity direction would have to reverse... Have a look at Brezin and Duclos thesis??}

\section{}
Here we compare the evolution of the peripheral angle $\psi_R$ between experiment and theory. Experiments in Ref.~\cite{guillamat_integer_2022} first show a spiral maintained over one day, followed by a rapid transition to an aster, see Fig.\ref{figapp}b. In theory, assuming uniform angle $\psi=\psi_R$ and transition controlled by boundary effects, we obtain an expression for the angle
\begin{equation}
\cos(2\psi_R)=\frac{1}{\nu}\frac{1}{1-j^2}\left[1-\frac{j^2}{2}\left(\frac{4\eta}{\gamma}+\nu^2+1\right)\right],\label{eq:appendix1}
\end{equation}
see SM \cite{supp_mater}. The critical value $j_{\rm p}^*$ at which spiral-to-aster transition occurs is given by Eq.~\eqref{eq-threshold}. Comparison between experiments and Eq.~\eqref{eq:appendix1} shows agreement for $\eta/\gamma \ll 1$, see Fig.\ref{figapp}a. Previous quantitative analysis \cite{blanch-mercader_quantifying_2021,blanch-mercader_integer_2021} suggests that $\eta/\gamma\sim 1$.

In the main text, we showed the existence of double spirals, Fig.~\ref{fig3}b. For high values of activity coefficients $\zeta\Delta\mu$, $\zeta_0\Delta\mu$ and increasing $j_{\rm p}>0$ (black arrow in Fig.~\ref{fig3}g), spiral orientation is maintained at the periphery while aster-like orientation develops in center. Compared to uniform angle states, this delays the spiral-aster transition time, see Fig.~\ref{figapp}b. Thus, double spiral itself can also quantitatively reproduce experimental data.
