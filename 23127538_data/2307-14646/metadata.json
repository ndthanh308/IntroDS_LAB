  "abstract": "Certain periodical cicadas exhibit life cycles with durations of 13 or 17 years, and it is now generally accepted that such large prime numbers arise evolutionarily to avoid synchrony with predators. Less well explored is the question of how, in the face of intrinsic biological and environmental noise, insects within a brood emerge together in large successive swarms from underground during springtime warming. Here we consider the decision-making process of underground cicada nymphs experiencing random but spatially-correlated thermal microclimates like those in nature. Introducing short-range communication between insects leads to a model of consensus building that maps on to the statistical physics of an Ising model with a quenched, spatially correlated random magnetic field and annealed site dilution, which displays the kinds of collective swarms seen in nature.",
