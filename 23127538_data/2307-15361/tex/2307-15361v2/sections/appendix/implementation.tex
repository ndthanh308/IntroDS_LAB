\section{Implementation Details}\label{app:imp_details}

\subsection{Availability of Data}

The bike sharing dataset \citep{fanaee2014event} contains 10,886 records of bike rentals between 2011 and 2012 from the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C. The regression task is forecasting demand for bike rentals based on time and environmental measures such as month and weather. The data is publicly available at \href{https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bike-sharing-demand/data}{Kaggle}.

The COMPAS dataset \citep{angwin2016machine} contains 6,172 records of criminal history from Broward County from 2013 and 2014. The classification task is assessing a criminal defendant’s likelihood to re-offend based on jail and prison time, and demographics. The data is publicly available at \href{https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis}{Propublica's Github}.

Nomao is a search engine of places. The Nomao dataset \citep{misc_nomao_227} contains 34,465 records with comparison features about places, such as name and localization, from different sources. The classification task is detecting whether two sources of information refer to the same place. The data is publicly available at \href{https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&id=1486&status=active}{OpenML}.


\subsection{Reproducibility Instructions}

The code for our ranking method, experiments, and visualizations was written in the Python programming language (Python version 3.10.3) and can be found in this \href{https://github.com/BityaNeuhof/confident_feature_ranking}{Git repository}.  The ICRanks R package was imported to Python through the rpy2 package.


\subsection{Computing Infrastructure}

The experiments were performed on a server with 64G RAM and 16 CPUs.
