  "abstract": "The study of \\textit{Dedekind Zeta Functions} over a number field extension uses different aspects of both \\textit{Algebraic} and \\textit{Analytic Number Theory}. In this paper, we shall learn about the structure and different analytic aspects of such functions, namely the domain of its convregence and analyticity at different points of $\\mathbb{C}$ when the function is defined over any finite field extension $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ . Moreover, given any two Number Fields $L$ and $K$ over $\\mathbb{Q}$ with $L$ being Normal over $K$, our intention is to classify and study the primes in $K$ which split completely in $L$. Also, we shall explore some special cases related to this result.",
