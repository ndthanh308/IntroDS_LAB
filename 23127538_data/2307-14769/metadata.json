  "abstract": "We prove that every three-dimensional polyhedron is uniquely determined by its dihedral angles and edge lengths, even if nonconvex or self-intersecting, under two plausible sufficient conditions: (i) the polyhedron has only convex faces and (ii) it does not have partially-flat vertices, and under an additional technical requirement that (iii) any triple of vertices is not collinear. The proof is consistently valid for Euclidean, hyperbolic and spherical geometry, which takes a completely different approach from the argument of the Cauchy rigidity theorem. Various counterexamples are provided that arise when these conditions are violated, and self-contained proofs are presented whenever possible. As a corollary, the rigidity of several families of polyhedra is also established. Finally, we propose two conjectures: the first suggests that Condition (iii) can be removed, and the second concerns the rigidity of spherical nonconvex polygons.",
