  "abstract": "We establish a partial regularity result for solutions of parabolic systems with general $\\varphi$-growth, where $\\varphi$ is an Orlicz function. In this setting we can develop a unified approach that is independent of the degeneracy of system and relies on two caloric approximation results: the $\\varphi$-caloric approximation, which was introduced in Diening, Schwarzacher, Stroffolini and Verde (2017) (arXiv:1606.01706), and an improved version of the \\mathcal{A}-caloric approximation, which we prove without using the classical compactness method.",
