\section{Concluding Remarks}
We conjecture that GMP admits an $O(\sqrt{\log n})$ approximation, based on suitably rounding the configuration LP. However, we are unable to prove any $o(\log n)$ approximation even in the restricted assignment case (note that the integrality gap and hardness instances in this paper only use restricted assignment).
Finding a $o(\log n)$ approximation algorithm for any of these variants would be extremely interesting.
