  "abstract": "A trust-aware safe control system for autonomous navigation in the presence of humans, specifically pedestrians, is presented. The system combines model predictive control (MPC) with control barrier functions (CBFs) and trust estimation to ensure safe and reliable navigation in complex environments. Pedestrian trust values are computed based on features, extracted from camera sensor images, such as mutual eye contact and smartphone usage. These trust values are integrated into the MPC controller's CBF constraints, allowing the autonomous vehicle to make informed decisions considering pedestrian behavior. Simulations conducted in the CARLA driving simulator demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed system, showcasing more conservative behaviour around inattentive pedestrians and vice versa. The results highlight the practicality of the system in real-world applications, providing a promising approach to enhance the safety and reliability of autonomous navigation systems, especially self-driving vehicles.",
