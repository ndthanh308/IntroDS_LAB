  "abstract": "We extend the Berezinskii diagrammatic technique to one-dimensional disordered spin systems, in which time-reversal invariance is broken due to a spin-orbit coupling term inducing left-right asymmetric scattering. We then use this formalism to theoretically describe the dynamics of the quantum boomerang effect, a recently discovered manifestation of Anderson localization. The theoretical results are confirmed by exact numerical simulations of wave-packet dynamics in a random potential.",
