  "abstract": "We study the dynamics of a coupled system, formed by a rigid body with a cavity entirely filled with magnetohydrodynamic compressible fluid. Our aim is to derive the global existence of the unique classical solutions and weak solutions to this system. Moreover, we show the weak-strong uniqueness principle which means that a weak solution coincides with a strong solution on the time existence of a strong solution, provided they emanate from the same initial data.",
