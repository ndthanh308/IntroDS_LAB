@article{kuusela_2018,
	abstract = { Argo floats measure seawater temperature and salinity in the upper 2000 m of the global ocean. Statistical analysis of the resulting spatio-temporal dataset is challenging owing to its non-stationary structure and large size. We propose mapping these data using locally stationary Gaussian process regression where covariance parameter estimation and spatio-temporal prediction are carried out in a moving-window fashion. This yields computationally tractable non-stationary anomaly fields without the need to explicitly model the non-stationary covariance structure. We also investigate Student t-distributed fine-scale variation as a means to account for non-Gaussian heavy tails in ocean temperature data. Cross-validation studies comparing the proposed approach with the existing state of the art demonstrate clear improvements in point predictions and show that accounting for the non-stationarity and non-Gaussianity is crucial for obtaining well-calibrated uncertainties. This approach also provides data-driven local estimates of the spatial and temporal dependence scales for the global ocean, which are of scientific interest in their own right. },
