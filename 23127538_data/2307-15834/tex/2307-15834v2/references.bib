	abstract = {Let X1,..., XN be N standardized normal variables with correlation matrix {ρij} and let X(1) ⩽ ... ⩽ X(N) denote the ordered Xi. Besides some general distribution theory this paper deals with the case where $\rho_{ij} = \rho(\rho > 0)$ for all i and j (i ‡ j). Let FN (H;ρ) denote the probability that X(N) ⩽ H. Gupta (1963a) discussed the evaluation of the multivariate normal integral and computed the function FN(H;ρ) for selected values of N,ρ and H. In the present paper, tables are provided for the percentage points of X(N), namely, the values of H satisfying FN(H;ρ) = 1 - α, when α = 0.010, 0.025, 0.050, 0.100, 0.250; N = 1(1)10(2)50 and ρ = 0.100, 0.125, 0.200, 1/3, 0.375, 0.400, 1/2, 0.600, 0.625, 2/3, 0.700, 0.750, 0.800, 0.875, 0.900. The method of evaluation of the percentage points is discussed. Specific applications illustrating the use of the tables are given. These applications relate to multiple decision rules, multiple comparison problems and some tests of hypotheses.},

Symmetries are very powerful because they provide two samples that can be compared without requiring simulation. Focusing on the data, exclusive selections which exhibit significant asymmetry can be identified efficiently and marked for further study. Using a simple and generic test statistic which compares two matrices already provides good sensitivity, only slightly worse than that of the profile likelihood ratio test statistic which relies on the exact knowledge of the signal shape. This can be exploited for rapidly scanning large portions of the measured data, in an attempt to identify regions of interest. We also demonstrate that weakly supervised Neural Networks could be used for this purpose as well.},

The number of simulations required can be extremely small, as low as 19 to run a test with level 0.05. We discuss three extensions of the method: (1) a randomized tie-breaking technique which allows one to use test statistics with discrete null distributions, without further information on the mass points; (2) an extension (maximized Monte Carlo tests) which yields provably valid tests when the test statistic depends on a (finite) number of nuisance parameters; (3) an asymptotic version which allows one to get asymptotically valid tests without any need to establish an asymptotic distribution. As the method is computer intensive, we describe an R package (MaxMC) that allows one to implement this type of procedure. A number of special cases and applications are discussed.},
