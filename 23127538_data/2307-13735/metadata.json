  "abstract": "We consider BPS states in M theory compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold with one Kähler parameter, and investigate their relation to blackholes and blackrings. On the microscopic side, a characterization of the BPS degeneracy can be obtained from the non-perturbative part of the topological string free energy according to the Gopakumar-Vafa conjecture. On the macroscopic side, the Wald entropy of relevant black objects in the four-dimensional IIA description is computed from the perturbative part of the same topological string free energy following the work of Cardoso-de Wit-Mohaupt and then lifted to five-dimensional M theory through the Gaiotto-Strominger-Yin correspondence. For a given value of the M2 brane charge, we find that for small angular momenta, the microscopic BPS degeneracy matches the entropy of a rotating blackhole, whereas an apparent transition occurs at a critical value of the angular momentum. Beyond this value, we find encouraging evidence that the microscopic counting is well approximated by the entropy of a blackring. We conclude by formulating a new puzzle involving the corrections due to degenerate worldsheet instantons.",
