\section{Appendix C: Additional Results}
\label{sec:appendc}

We here first include the evaluation on 1D-reaction PDE, which is the supplement for the main results in Table \ref{tbl:main}. The evaluation results are shown in Table \ref{tab:add}. Again, PINNsFormer outperforms all other methods in training loss, rMAE, and rRMSE. In particular, PINNsFormer is the only approach that avoids the convergence issue (failure modes) of PINNs for 1D-reaction PDE.

For simplicity, we then show the selected prediction plots, which include the comparison between conventional PINNs (MLP+\texttt{Tanh}) and PINNsFormer (Trans.+\texttt{Wavelet}) for all three PDEs. The plots are shown in Figure \ref{fig:plot}. Clearly, we observe approximations by PINNsFormer is more accurate and closer to the ground truth, which matches the main evaluation results.
