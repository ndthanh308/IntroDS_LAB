In our research, we introduce a new method for improving the latency of the Narwhal-based consensus algorithm. We propose the Board and Clerk Protocol as an efficient consensus algorithm for blockchain-aided systems that rely on the UTXO Model. Our algorithm's foundation is a novel commit rule, combined with a fast-commitment channel, which collectively can reduce the latency of a minimum of 50\% of transactions without incurring additional communication overhead. Our performed experimental results indicate that our protocol effectively leverages redundant nodes and transactions to minimize latency. Given that this redundancy originates from security requirements, the latency reduction essentially incurs without extra costs if the node computational power is not a limiting factor.

Furthermore, we outlined two strategies for achieving verifiable transaction outcomes without necessitating an increase in communication rounds. We regard this characteristic of our research as a crucial feature that a public blockchain system based on a consortium should support. 

Lastly, we hope  our proposal may motivate researchers to explore the possibility of using the underlying data model to augment consensus algorithms akin to our UTXO-enhanced consensus algorithm.
