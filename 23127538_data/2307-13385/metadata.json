  "abstract": "Weak antilocalization (WAL) effect is commonly observed in 2D systems, or 3D topological insulators, topological semimetal systems. Here we report the clear sign of WAL effect in high quality Ta$_{0.7}$Nb$_{0.3}$Sb$_2$ single crystals, in below 50$^\\circ$ K region. The chemical vapor transport method was employed to grow the single crystal samples, the high crystallization quality and uniform element distribution are verified by X-ray diffractions and electron microscopy techniques. Employing the Hall effect and two-band model fitting, the high carrier mobility (> 1000 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ in 2 to 300$^\\circ$ K region) and off-compensation electron/hole ratio are obtained. Due to the different angular dependence of WAL effect and the fermiology of Ta$_{0.7}$Nb$_{0.3}$Sb$_2$ single crystal, interesting magnetic-field-induced symmetry change is observed in angular magnetoresistance. These interesting transport properties will lead to more theoretical and applicational exploration in Ta$_{0.7}$Nb$_{0.3}$Sb$_2$ and related semimetal materials.",
