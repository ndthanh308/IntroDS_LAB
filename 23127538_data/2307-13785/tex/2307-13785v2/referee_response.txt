We thank the referee for their kind notes of encouragement and careful scrutiny of our work.

We list the points raised by the referee and our responses to them as follows.


1. In equation (8), the symbol M_i is not defined.

- 

2. The face velocity in equation (9) has not been introduced.

3. in equation (17), dl is not defined, nor is the quantity W (probably the primitive variables).

4. in equation (23), does one have to add the mesh velocity in the time step constraint?

5. How is the resolution N defined for DISCO? Perhaps also define N as the number of resolution elements per dimension at the beginning of section 3.

6. Same as above for JET in Figure 5. Is there a reason why JET performs worse in this test when one would expect the opposite for a spherical symmetric setup?

- The reason for this counterintuitive result lies in the way errors are calculated for JET and Sprout.

7. In section 3.9, what is the "Hubble" constant for this setup?
