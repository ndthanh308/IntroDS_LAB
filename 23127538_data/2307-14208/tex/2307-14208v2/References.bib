abstract = {Contextual bandit algorithms provide principled online learning solutions to find optimal trade-offs between exploration and exploitation with companion side-information. Most contextual bandit algorithms simply assume the learner would have access to the entire set of features, which govern the generation of payoffs from a user to an item. However, in practice it is challenging to exhaust all relevant features ahead of time, and oftentimes due to privacy or sampling constraints many factors are unobservable to the algorithm. Failing to model such hidden factors leads a system to make constantly suboptimal predictions. In this paper, we propose to learn the hidden features for contextual bandit algorithms. Hidden features are explicitly introduced in our reward generation assumption, in addition to the observable contextual features. A scalable bandit algorithm is achieved via coordinate descent, in which closed form solutions exist at each iteration for both hidden features and bandit parameters. Most importantly, we rigorously prove that the developed contextual bandit algorithm achieves a sublinear upper regret bound with high probability, and a linear regret is inevitable if one fails to model such hidden features. Extensive experimentation on both simulations and large-scale real-world datasets verified the advantages of the proposed algorithm compared with several state-of-the-art contextual bandit algorithms and existing ad-hoc combinations between bandit algorithms and matrix factorization methods.},

For each individual, measures of anisotropy and diffusivity were obtained from atlas-transformed images in the anterior and posterior callosum and in the frontal, parietal, temporal and occipital white matter. These data revealed age differences in anisotropy and diffusivity in all assessed regions. Age effects were greater in the anterior as opposed to the posterior corpus callosum and greater in the frontal white matter than in the temporal, parietal and occipital white matter, suggesting age-associated differences in white matter that exhibit a roughly anterior-to-posterior gradient. In contrast, individuals with early-stage dementia exhibited minimal, if any, additional change in anterior regions but did show greater deterioration of white matter in posterior lobar regions. Taken collectively, these results indicate that nondemented aging is characterized by significant changes in white matter most prominently in anterior brain regions. The dissociation between the regional effects of age and dementia status suggests that the mechanisms underlying age-associated cognitive decline are likely distinct from those underlying DAT.}",

abstract = {In this paper, we study the problem of online influence maximization in social networks. In this problem, a learner aims to identify the set of "best influencers" in a network by interacting with the network, i.e., repeatedly selecting seed nodes and observing activation feedback in the network. We capitalize on an important property of the influence maximization problem named network assortativity, which is ignored by most existing works in online influence maximization. To realize network assortativity, we factorize the activation probability on the edges into latent factors on the corresponding nodes, including influence factor on the giving nodes and susceptibility factor on the receiving nodes. We propose an upper confidence bound based online learning solution to estimate the latent factors, and therefore the activation probabilities. Considerable regret reduction is achieved by our factorization based online influence maximization algorithm. Extensive empirical evaluations on two real-world networks showed the effectiveness of our proposed solution.},

They have been extensively used in many important practical scenarios, such as display advertising and content recommendation. A common practice estimates the unknown bandit parameters pertaining to each user independently. This unfortunately ignores dependency among users and thus leads to suboptimal solutions, especially for the applications that have strong social components.In this paper, we develop a collaborative contextual bandit algorithm, in which the adjacency graph among users is leveraged to share context and payoffs among neighboring users while online updating. We rigorously prove an improved upper regret bound of the proposed collaborative bandit algorithm comparing to conventional independent bandit algorithms. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and three large-scale real-world datasets verified the improvement of our proposed algorithm against several state-of-the-art contextual bandit algorithms.},

 abstract = {Breast cancer is the most common nonskin cancer and the second leading cause of cancer death in U.S. women. Although mammography is the most effective modality for breast cancer screening, it has several potential risks, including high false-positive rates. Therefore, the balance of benefits and risks, which depend on personal characteristics, is critical in designing a mammography screening schedule. In contrast to prior research and existing guidelines that consider population-based screening recommendations, we propose a personalized mammography screening policy based on the prior screening history and personal risk characteristics of women. We formulate a finite-horizon, partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) model for this problem. Our POMDP model incorporates two methods of detection (self or screen), age-specific unobservable disease progression, and age-specific mammography test characteristics. We solve this POMDP optimally after setting transition probabilities to values estimated from a validated microsimulation model. Additional published data is used to specify other model inputs such as sensitivity and specificity of test results. Our results show that our proposed personalized screening schedules outperform the existing guidelines with respect to the total expected quality-adjusted life years, while significantly decreasing the number of mammograms and false-positives. We also report the lifetime risk of developing undetected invasive cancer associated with each screening scenario.},
