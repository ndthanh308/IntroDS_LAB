  "abstract": "With the broadening landscape of proposals for future Higgs, top and electroweak physics factories, detector diversity as well as the reach and depth of physics analysis increase. One emerging topic of renewed interest is particle identification (PID). This paper highlights the available technology options and the physics need for dedicated PID. It introduces a new framework to perform a coherent PID assessment across the different future collider proposals, called Comprehensive PID (CPID). Its structure is laid out, and examples are shown, which demonstrate the power and flexibility of this approach.",
