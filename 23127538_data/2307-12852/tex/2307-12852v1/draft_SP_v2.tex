\begin{abstract}
By analyzing 7.33 fb$^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ annihilation data
collected at center-of-mass energies between 4.128 and 4.226 GeV with the BESIII detector,
we report the observation of the semileptonic decay $D^+_s\to
\eta^\prime \mu^+\nu_\mu$ and studies of the $D_s^+ \to
\eta\mu^+\nu_\mu$ and $D_s^+ \to \eta^\prime\mu^+\nu_\mu$ decay dynamics for the first time.
The branching fractions of $D_s^+ \to \eta\mu^+\nu_\mu$ and $D_s^+ \to \eta^\prime\mu^+\nu_\mu$ are determined to be
$(2.215\pm0.051_{\rm stat}\pm0.052_{\rm syst})\%$ and
$(0.801\pm0.055_{\rm stat}\pm0.031_{\rm syst})\%$, respectively,
with precision improved by factors of 5.9 and 6.5 compared to the previous best measurements.
Combined with the results for the decays $D_s^+ \to \eta e^+\nu_e$ and $D_s^+ \to \eta^\prime e^+\nu_e$,
 the ratios of the decay widths are examined, both inclusively and in several $\mu^+\nu_\mu$ four-momentum transfer ranges. No evidence for lepton flavor universality violation is found within the current statistics.
The products of the hadronic form factors $f_+^{\eta^{(\prime)}}(0)$ and the $c\to s$ Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix element $|V_{cs}|$ are determined. The results based on the two-parameter series expansion are $f^{\eta}_+(0)|V_{cs}| = 0.451\pm0.010_{\rm stat}\pm0.008_{\rm syst}$ and $f^{\eta^{\prime}}_+(0)|V_{cs}| = 0.506\pm0.037_{\rm stat}\pm0.011_{\rm syst}$, which constrain present models on $f_{+}^{\eta^{(\prime)}}(0)$. The $\eta-\eta^\prime$ mixing angle in the quark flavor basis is determined to be
$\phi_{\rm P} =(40.2\pm2.1_{\rm stat}\pm0.7_{\rm syst})^\circ$.

The couplings between the three families of leptons and the gauge bosons are equal in the standard model (SM). This property is known as lepton flavor universality (LFU). In recent years, however, hints of tensions between experimental measurements and the SM predictions were reported in the semileptonic (SL) $B$ decays~\cite{HFLAV}, the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon~\cite{Muong-2:2006rrc,Muong-2:2021ojo} and the Cabibbo angle anomaly~\cite{Coutinho:2019aiy,Crivellin:2020lzu}. 
For example, the measured branching fraction (BF) ratios
${\mathcal R}_{D^{(*)}}^{\tau/\ell}={\mathcal B}_{B\to \bar D^{(*)}\tau^+\nu_\tau}/{\mathcal B}_{B\to \bar D^{(*)}\ell^+\nu_\ell}$~($\ell=\mu$, $e$)~\cite{babar_1,babar_2,lhcb_1,belle2015,belle2016,Belle:2019rba,LHCbreport}
 deviate from the SM predictions by $3.3\sigma$~\cite{HFLAV}. 
Although these tensions have been explained by various theoretical models~\cite{BhupalDev:2020zcy,Nomura:2021oeu,Bordone:2016gaq,Altmannshofer:2017yso,Crivellin:2017zlb,Becirevic:2016yqi,BFajfer2012,Fajfer2012,Celis2013,Crivellin2015,Crivellin2016,Bauer2016}, no definite conclusion is established yet. Precision tests of LFU in various SL decays of heavy mesons can provide deeper insight into these anomalies. 
Possible LFU in SL $D^+_s$ decays is not yet well tested, due to poor knowledge of semimuonic $D^+_s$ decays. There may indeed be observable LFU violation effects in the SL decays mediated via $c\to s\ell^+\nu_\ell$~\cite{Fajfer2015}. In the SM, the ratio ${\mathcal R}^{\eta^{(\prime)}}_{\mu/e}={\mathcal B}_{D_s^+\to\eta^{(\prime)}\mu^+\nu_\mu}/{\mathcal B}_{D_s^+\to\eta^{(\prime)} e^+\nu_e}$ is predicted to be 0.95-0.99~\cite{Hu:2021zmy,Ivanov:2019nqd,Cheng:2017pcq}. 
Precision measurements of $D^+_s\to \eta^{(\prime)}\mu^+\nu_\mu$ are important to test $\mu$-$e$ LFU with the SL decays $D^+_s\to \eta^{(\prime)}\ell^+\nu_\ell$, which is expected to be the most competitive mode in the $D^+_s$ sector. 

In the SM, the decay rates of $D^+_s\to \eta^{(\prime)}\mu^+\nu_\mu$
can be expressed as functions of the $c\to s$ Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element $|V_{cs}|$ and
the hadronic form factors~(FFs) $f_+^{\eta^{(\prime)}}(q^2)$, which describe the weak and strong interaction effects, respectively. Here, $q$ is the four-momentum transfer to the $\mu^+\nu_\mu$ system. Measurements of $D^+_s\to\eta^{(\prime)}\ell^+\nu_\ell$
decay dynamics therefore provide an opportunity to determine $|V_{cs}|$ and $f_+^{\eta^{(\prime)}}(0)$~\cite{Riggio:2017zwh,Zhang:2018jtm,Fang:2014sqa}.
The $f^{\eta^{(\prime)}}_+(0)$ are calculated with 
lattice quantum-chromodynamics~(QCD)~\cite{Bali:2014pva}, QCD light-cone sum rules~\cite{Hu:2021zmy,Offen:2013nma,Duplancic:2015zna,Azizi:2010zj}, traditional and covariant light-front quark models~\cite{Verma:2011yw,Cheng:2017pcq}, constituent quark model~\cite{Melikhov:2000yu}, covariant confined quark model~\cite{Soni:2018adu,Ivanov:2019nqd}, QCD sum rules~\cite{Colangelo:2001cv}, with results in a wide range $0.432-0.78~(0.404-0.78)$. Determinations of $|V_{cs}|$ and $f^{\eta^{(\prime)}}_+(0)$ are crucial to test CKM matrix unitarity and validate FF calculations.  References~\cite{Koponen:2012di,Koponen:2013tua,FermilabLattice:2022gku,HeavyFlavorAveragingGroup:2022wzx} state
that the FFs of the SL decays mediated via $c\to s(d)\ell^+\nu_\ell$ are insensitive to spectator quarks. Specifically, the FFs of $D^{0(+)}\to \bar K\ell^+\nu_\ell$ and $D_s^+\to\eta\ell^+\nu_\ell$ are expected to agree within 3\%~\cite{Koponen:2012di}.  Comparisons of the measured FFs of $D^+_s\to \eta\mu^+\nu_\mu$ and $D^{0(+)}\to \bar K\ell^+\nu_\ell$ offer important tests on this expectation.  Once this prediction is validated, it will be helpful to constrain the QCD calculations of the FFs of the SL $B$ decays, which are crucial inputs for precise determinations of the CKM matrix elements~\cite{Koponen:2012di,Koponen:2013tua,Brambilla:2014jmp,Bailey:2012rr}.
In addition, the measured BFs allow extraction of the singlet-octet $\eta$-$\eta^{\prime}$-gluon mixing angle~\cite{Christ:2010dd,Dudek:2011tt}, $\phi_{\rm P}$,  via
$\cot^4\phi_{\rm P}=\frac{\Gamma_{D^+_s\to\eta^\prime \mu^+\nu_\mu}/\Gamma_{D^+_s\to\eta
    \mu^+\nu_\mu}}{\Gamma_{D^+\to\eta^\prime \mu^+\nu_\mu}/\Gamma_{D^+\to\eta \mu^+\nu_\mu}}$, in which a possible gluon component cancels~\cite{DiDonato:2011kr}. A precise value of $\phi_{P}$ is useful for the understanding of non-perturbative QCD confinement. 

Previously, BESIII reported the BFs of $D^+_s\to\eta^{(\prime)}\mu^+\nu_\mu$~\cite{Ablikim:2018} with large uncertainties of $20~(51)\%$ using 0.482 fb$^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ collision data taken at a center-of-mass energy $E_{\rm CM}=4.009$ GeV. In this Letter, we report significantly improved measurements of the BFs of $D^+_s\to \eta^{(\prime)}\mu^+\nu_\mu$ and investigate for the first time their decay dynamics,
by analyzing 7.33~fb$^{-1}$ of $e^+e^-$ collision data taken at $E_{\rm CM}$ between 4.128 and 4.226 GeV with the BESIII
detector.  Furthermore, we test $\mu$-$e$ LFU in $D^+_s\to \eta^{(\prime)}\ell^+\nu_\ell$ decays 
in the full kinematic range and several $q^2$ intervals. Charge-conjugate modes are implied throughout this Letter. 

A description of the design and performance of the BESIII detector can be found in
Ref.~\cite{Ablikim2010345}. 
About 83\% of the data analyzed in this Letter profits from an upgrade of the end cap time-of-flight system
with multi-gap resistive plate chambers with a time resolution of
60\,ps~\cite{Lxin,Gyingxiao}.
 Monte Carlo (MC) simulated events are generated with a
{\sc{geant4}}-based~\cite{Agostinelli:2002hh} simulation software, which includes
the geometric description~\cite{Huang:2022wuo} and a simulation of the response of the detector. An inclusive MC sample with an equivalent luminosity of 40 times that of the data is produced at $E_{\rm CM}$ between 4.128 and 4.226~GeV. It
includes open charm processes, initial state radiation (ISR) production of charmonium [$\psi(3770)$, $\psi(3686)$ and $J/\psi$], $q\bar q\,(q=u,\,d,\,s$) continuum processes, along with Bhabha
scattering, $\mu^+\mu^-$, $\tau^+\tau^-$ and $\gamma\gamma$ events.  The open charm processes are
generated using {\sc{conexc}}~\cite{Ping:2013jka}. The effects of ISR and final state radiation are included. 
 Signal MC samples of the SL decays $D^+_s\to \eta^{(\prime)} \mu^+\nu_\mu$ are simulated with the two-parameter series expansion
model~\cite{Chikilev:1999zn}, with parameters obtained in this work. 
 The input cross section of $e^+e^-\to D^\pm_sD^{*\mp}_s$ is taken from Ref.~\cite{crosssection}.
In the MC generation, known particle decays are generated by {\sc{evtgen}}~\cite{ref:evtgen} with the BFs taken from the Particle Data Group~\cite{PDG2022}, and other modes are generated using {\sc{lundcharm}} \cite{ref:lundcharm}.

In $e^+e^-$ collisions at $E_{\rm CM}$ between 4.128 and 4.226~GeV, the $D_s^+$ mesons are produced
predominantly via $e^+e^-\to D^\pm_sD_s^{*\mp}$.
Candidates in which one $D_s^-$ is fully reconstructed in one of the fourteen hadronic decay modes,
$D^-_s\to K^+K^-\pi^-$, $K^+K^-\pi^-\pi^0$, $K^0_SK^-$,
$K^0_SK^-\pi^0$,
$K^0_SK^0_S\pi^-$,
$K^0_SK^+\pi^-\pi^-$,
$K^0_SK^-\pi^+\pi^-$,
$\pi^+\pi^-\pi^-$,
$\eta_{\gamma\gamma}\pi^-$, $\eta_{\pi^0\pi^+\pi^-}\pi^-$,
$\eta^\prime_{\eta_{\gamma\gamma}\pi^+\pi^-}\pi^-$, $\eta^\prime_{\gamma\rho^0}\pi^-$,
$\eta_{\gamma\gamma}\rho^-$, and
$\eta_{\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0}\rho^-$,
 are called the single-tag (ST) $D^-_s$. 
 Those in which the ST $D^-_s$, the transition $\gamma(\pi^0)$ of the $D_s^{*\mp}$ decay and the signal $D^+_s$ decay of interest
are simultaneously reconstructed are called double-tag~(DT) events.
Based on these, we determine the BF of the signal decay by
\begin{equation}
{\mathcal B}_{\rm sig} = N_{\rm DT}/(N^{\rm tot}_{\rm ST}\cdot \epsilon_{\gamma(\pi^0)\rm sig}),
\end{equation}
where $N^{\rm tot}_{\rm ST}=\sum_k N^k_{\rm ST}$ and $N_{\rm DT}$ are the ST and DT yields in data,
and $\epsilon_{\gamma(\pi^0)\rm sig}$ is the effective signal efficiency of selecting $\gamma(\pi^0)\eta^{(\prime)}\mu^+\nu_\mu$
in the presence of ST $D^-_s$. The $\epsilon_{\gamma(\pi^0)\rm sig}$ is the averaged efficiency of $\epsilon_{\gamma\rm sig}$ and $\epsilon_{\pi^0\rm sig}$, and estimated by
$\sum_k\frac{N^k_{\rm ST}}{N^{\rm tot}_{\rm ST}}\frac{\epsilon^k_{\rm DT}}{\epsilon^k_{\rm ST}}$,
where $\epsilon^k_{\rm ST}$ and $\epsilon^k_{\rm DT}$ are the ST and DT efficiencies for the $k$-th tag mode, respectively. 

The selection criteria for all ST candidates are the same as Ref.~\cite{BAM595}, and a detailed description can be found in this reference.
For each tag mode, the ST yield is extracted from a fit to the corresponding invariant mass ($M_{\rm tag}$) spectrum of the ST candidates. The details of the fit results can be found in Ref.~\cite{BAM595}.
Summing over all tag modes, we obtain the total ST yield $N^{\rm tot}_{\rm ST}=(817.0\pm3.4_{\rm stat})\times 10^3$.

We select candidates for the transition $\gamma\,(\pi^0)$ from $D^{*+}_s$ 
decay among the unused particles recoiling against the ST $D_s^-$, 
by using the kinematic variable 
$\Delta E\equiv E_{D^-_s} + E_{\gamma(\pi^0)} + \sqrt{|\vec{p}_{\gamma(\pi^0)}+\vec{p}_{D^-_s}|^2c^2 + m^2_{D_s^+}c^4} - E_{\rm CM}$,
where $E_{\gamma, \pi^0, D_s^-}$ and $\vec{p}_{\gamma, \pi^0, D_s^-}$ are
the energy and momentum of $\gamma$, $\pi^0$, or $D_s^-$.
All the $\gamma$ or $\pi^0$ candidates unused in the tag selection are looped over.
If multiple candidates survive the selection, the one giving the minimum $|\Delta E|$ is kept for further analysis.  No further requirement on $|\Delta E|$ is applied.

In the presence of ST $D_s^-$ and transition $\gamma\,(\pi^0)$,
signal decay candidates are selected with the remaining unused tracks.
Particle identification (PID) for muons combines the information of the specific ionization energy loss in the multilayer drift chamber,
the flight time in the time-of-flight system, and the energy deposited in the electromagnetic
calorimeter~(EMC). Likelihoods under various particle hypotheses (${\mathcal L}_i$, $i=e$, $\mu$, and $K$) are calculated.
Charged tracks satisfying ${\mathcal L}_\mu>0.001$, ${\mathcal L}_\mu>{\mathcal L}_e$, ${\mathcal L}_\mu>{\mathcal L}_K$,
and $E_{\rm EMC} \in (0.10, 0.28)~\rm GeV$ are assigned as muon candidates,
where $E_{\rm EMC}$ is the energy deposited in the EMC of muon candidates.
After also reconstructing the signal-side $\eta^{(\prime)}$ with the same criteria used for the ST daughters, the DT candidates are vetoed if they contain any additional charged tracks ($N_{\rm extra}^{\rm char}$)  or $\pi^0$ reconstructed by two unused photons ($N_{\rm extra}^{\pi^0}$). Furthermore, the energy of any unused shower ($E_{\rm \gamma~extra }^{\rm max}$) in an event is required to be less  than 0.2\,GeV.
The energy and momentum of the missing neutrino of the signal SL decay are derived
as $E_\nu \equiv E_{\rm CM} - \Sigma_i E_i$ and $\vec{p}_\nu \equiv -\Sigma_i \vec{p}_{i}$, respectively, where
$E_i$ and $\vec{p}_i$ are the energy and momentum of the particle $i$, with $i$ running over
the ST $D^-_s$, the transition $\gamma\,(\pi^0)$, and the $\eta^{(\prime)}$ and $\mu^+$ of the signal side.
To further reject the peaking backgrounds from $D_s^+\to\eta^{(\prime)} \pi^+$,
the invariant masses of $\eta^{(\prime)} \mu^+$, $M_{\eta^{(\prime)} \mu^+}$, are required to be less than 1.8~GeV/$c^2$.
Moreover, the peaking backgrounds from $D_s^+\to\eta^{(\prime)} \pi^+\pi^0$ are rejected by requiring the invariant masses of $\eta^{(\prime)} \nu_\mu$, $M_{\eta^{(\prime)} \nu_\mu}$,  to be greater than 0.97(1.27)~GeV/$c^2$.


The yield of  signal events is determined by a fit to the distribution of the kinematic variable
$ {\rm MM}^2 \equiv E_\nu^2/c^4 - |\vec{p}_\nu|^2/c^2$.
To improve the $\rm MM^2$ resolution, the candidate tracks, along with the missing neutrino, are subjected to a 3-constraint kinematic fit requiring energy and momentum conservation, constraining the invariant mass of each  $D_s^\pm$ meson to the known $D_s^\pm$ mass, and constraining the invariant
mass of the $D_s^-\gamma(\pi^0)$ or $D_s^+\gamma(\pi^0)$ combination to the known $D_s^{*\pm}$ mass. The combination with the lower $\chi^2$ is kept. 
The $\chi^2$ for $D_s^+\to\eta^\prime_{\gamma\rho^0}\mu^+\nu_\mu$ is required to be less than 30 to further suppress the non-$D_s^\pm D_s^{*\mp}$ backgrounds.

After imposing all above selection criteria, the resulting MM$^2$ distributions of the accepted candidates for
the various signal decay modes are exhibited in Fig.~\ref{fig:signal_yields_fromdata}.
For $D_s^+\to\eta^{(\prime)} \mu^+\nu_\mu$, the signal yield is extracted from a simultaneous unbinned maximum likelihood fit
to the MM$^2$ spectra for the two $\eta$ or $\eta^\prime$ reconstruction modes,
with BFs constrained to be the same in the fit.
The signal, peaking background of $D_s^+\to\eta^{(\prime)}\pi^+(\pi^0)$, and other background shapes are modeled by the individual simulated shapes taken from the inclusive MC sample.  The signal and peaking background shapes are convolved with a Gaussian resolution function to account for the differences between data and simulation.  The yields of the peaking backgrounds are fixed to the expectation from simulation, and the other yields are left free. 
The obtained signal efficiencies, signal yields, and resultant BFs are shown in Table~\ref{table:br}. The signal efficiencies have been corrected for small data-MC differences (overall factor $f^{\rm cor}=0.992 \sim 1.018$) due to $\eta, \pi^0$ reconstruction, $\mu^+$ PID, $E_{\gamma,~\rm extra}^{\rm max}, N_{\rm extra}^{\rm char}\, N_{\rm extra}^{\pi^0}$,  $M_{\eta^{(\prime)}\mu^+}, M_{\eta^{(\prime)}\nu_\mu}$, and $\chi^2$ requirements.

The systematic uncertainties in the BF measurements are listed in Table 1 of Ref.~\cite{Supplement} and are discussed below.

The uncertainty in the ST $D^{-}_s$ yields is studied 
by examining the change of the ST $D^{-}_s$ yields by varying the matched angle for signal shape and the order of Chebychev function for background shape.
The uncertainties in the tracking or PID efficiencies of $\pi^\pm$ and $\mu^+$ are studied with the
control samples of $e^+e^-\to K^+K^-\pi^+\pi^-$ and $e^+e^-\to \gamma \mu^+\mu^+$, respectively. 
The uncertainty of $\pi^0$ or $\eta$ reconstruction is assigned 
by studying the control sample of $e^+e^-\to K^+K^-\pi^+\pi^-\pi^0$. 
The uncertainty in the transition $\gamma(\pi^0)$ reconstruction is studied with the control sample of  $J/\psi\to \pi^0\pi^+\pi^-$~\cite{Ablikim:2011kv}.
The  uncertainty from the selection of the transition $\gamma(\pi^0)$ from $D_s^{*+}$ with the smallest $|\Delta E|$ method is estimated by using the control samples of $D_s^+\to K^+K^-\pi^+$ and $D_s^+\to\eta\pi^+\pi^0$.


The uncertainties due to the signal model are estimated 
by comparing the DT efficiencies by varying the input hadronic FFs measured in this Letter by $\pm 1\sigma$. 
The uncertainties due to the $M_{\eta^{(\prime)}\mu^+}$ and $M_{\eta^{(\prime)}\nu_\mu}$ requirements are estimated by using the DT events of
$D_s^+\to\eta^{(\prime)}e^+\nu_e$. 
The uncertainties from the $\eta^{(\prime)}$ reconstruction are estimated 
by analyzing the control sample of $J/\psi\to \phi\eta^{(\prime)}$.
The systematic uncertainties in the ${\rm MM}^2$ fit are studied 
by repeating the fits with different signal and background shapes.
The uncertainty in the peaking background yield is propagated 
by varying its size by $\pm1 \sigma$ of the corresponding BF~\cite{PDG2022}.

The uncertainties due to different multiplicities of tag environments~\cite{Ablikim:2018jun} are assigned by studying of data-MC efficiency differences.  
The uncertainty due to the finite MC statistics, which is dominated by that of the DT efficiency, is considered as a systematic uncertainty.

The uncertainties of the $E_{\rm \gamma~extra }^{\rm max}$, $N_{\rm extra}^{\pi^0}$, and
 $N_{\rm extra}^{\rm char}$ requirements are analyzed with  the
 DT events of $D_s^+\to\eta^{(\prime)}\pi^+(\pi^0)$ and $D_s^+\to\eta^{(\prime)}e^+\nu_e$.
The uncertainties of the $\chi^2$ requirements for $D_s^+\to\eta^{\prime}_{\gamma\rho^0}\mu^+\nu_\mu$ are studied with 
the DT events of $D_s^+\to\eta^{\prime}_{\gamma\rho^0}\pi^+$ and $D_s^+\to\eta^{\prime}_{\gamma\rho^0}e^+\nu_e$.
The uncertainties due to the quoted BFs of $\eta^{(\prime)}$ and $D_s^{*+}$ decays are cited from Ref.~\cite{PDG2022}.

The systematic uncertainties on the ST $D^{-}_s$ yields, $\mu^+$ and $\pi^\pm$ tracking and PID, photon selection, $\pi^0$ or $\eta$ reconstruction, peaking backgrounds, selection of the transition $\gamma(\pi^0)$, signal model, and $M_{\eta^{(\prime)}\mu^+}\&M_{\eta^{(\prime)}\nu_\mu}$ are correlated uncertainties between the two $\eta^{(\prime)}$ decay modes. The remaining uncertainties are uncorrelated. 
The total correlated systematic uncertainties are 2.2\% and 3.1\% for $D_s^+\to\eta\mu^+\nu_\mu$ and $D_s^+\to\eta^\prime\mu^+\nu_\mu$,  respectively; the total uncorrelated systematic uncertainties are 0.9\%, 2.1\%, 2.8\%, and 3.2\% for $D_s^+\to\eta_{\gamma\gamma}\mu^+\nu_\mu$, $D_s^+\to\eta_{\pi^0\pi^+\pi^-}\mu^+\nu_\mu$, $D_s^+\to\eta^\prime_{\eta\pi^+\pi^-}\mu^+\nu_\mu$, and $D_s^+\to\eta^\prime_{\gamma\rho^0}\mu^+\nu_\mu$, respectively.
The combined systematic uncertainties are 2.4\% for $D_s^+\to\eta\mu^+\nu_\mu$ and 3.8\% for $D_s^+\to\eta^{\prime}\mu^+\nu_\mu$, taking into account  correlated and uncorrelated systematic uncertainties with the method described in Ref.~\cite{Schmelling:1994pz}. 

The decay dynamics of $D^+_s\to\eta^{(\prime)} \mu^+\nu_\mu$ are investigated by dividing
individual candidate events into $m=8(3)$ intervals of $q^2$. Using the measured and theoretically expected partial decay rates in the $i$-th $q^2$ interval,
$\Delta\Gamma^i_{\rm msr}$ and $\Delta\Gamma^i_{\rm th}$,
we reconstruct a $\chi^2_{\rm FF}$ as
\begin{equation}
\small
    \chi^2_{\rm FF} = \underset{i,j=1}{\sum^{m}}(\Delta \Gamma^i_{\rm msr} - \Delta \Gamma^i_{\rm th})
    C_{ij}^{-1}
    (\Delta \Gamma^j_{\rm msr} - \Delta \Gamma^j_{\rm th}),
    \label{eq:chi_square}
\end{equation}
where $C_{ij}$ is the covariance matrix including correlations of $\Delta\Gamma^i_{\rm msr}$ among $q^2$ intervals.
The $\Delta\Gamma^i_{\rm th}$ relate to the hadronic FF via~\cite{Faustov:2019mqr}

\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{l}
        \displaystyle \frac{d\Gamma}{dq^2} =
   \frac{G_{F}^{2}|V_{cs}|^{2}}{24\pi^{3}}\frac{(q^{2}-m^{2}_{\mu})^2|p_{\eta^{(\prime)}}|}{q^{4}m^{2}_{D_s^+}}
\left [(1+\frac{m^{2}_{\mu}}{2q^{2}})m^{2}_{D_s^+}|p_{\eta^{(\prime)}}|^2|f^{\eta^{(\prime)}}_{+}(q^{2})|^{2}   
+\frac{3m^{2}_{\mu}}{8q^{2}}(m^{2}_{D_s^+}-m^{2}_{\eta^{(\prime)}})^{2}|f^{\eta^{(\prime)}}_{0}(q^{2})|^{2}\right ],
\end{array}
\end{equation}
\end{widetext}
where  $G_F$ is the Fermi coupling constant~\cite{PDG2022}, $|p_{\eta^{(\prime)}}|$ is the 3-momentum of $\eta^{(\prime)}$ in the $D_s^+$ rest frame, $m_{\mu(\eta^{(\prime)})}$ is the $\mu^+(\eta^{(\prime)})$ mass. The parameters of hadronic FFs are extracted by minimizing $\chi^2_{\rm FF}$.

The hadronic FFs $f_+^{\eta^{(\prime)}}(q^2)$ are parameterized with one of three models.
The first (Model I) is a two-parameter series expansion~\cite{Becher:2005bg}, the second (Model II) is a modified pole parametrization~\cite{Becirevic:1999kt}, and the third (Model III) is a simple pole parametrization~\cite{Becirevic:1999kt}.
We fix the pole mass at the known $D^{*+}_s$ mass~\cite{PDG2022}. The same formulas are applied for $f_0^{\eta^{(\prime)}}(q^2)$ after replacing the pole mass with $m_{D_s^{*0}}$.  


The $\Delta\Gamma^i_{\rm msr}$ are determined by
$\Delta \Gamma^i_{\rm msr} \equiv \int_i\frac{d\Gamma}{dq^2}dq^2 = \frac{N_{\rm prd}^i}{\tau_{D_s^+}
  \cdot N^{\rm tot}_{\rm ST}}$, where
$\tau_{D_s^+}$ is the $D_s^+$ meson lifetime~\cite{PDG2022,Aaij:2017vqj}
and $N^i_{\rm prd}= \sum^{m}_{j}(\epsilon^{-1})_{ij} N_{\rm DT}^{j}$ is the corresponding produced signal yield.
 The observed signal yield ($N^j_{\rm DT}$) is obtained from a similar fit of the corresponding MM$^2$ distribution. The signal efficiency matrix ($\epsilon_{ij}$) is determined via
$\epsilon_{ij} = \sum_k\left[(1/N_{\rm ST}^{\rm tot})\cdot (N^{ij}_{\rm DT}/N^j_{\rm gen})_k
\cdot (N^k_{\rm ST}/\epsilon^k_{\rm ST})\cdot f^{\rm cor}\right]$,
where
$N^j_{\rm gen}$ is the total signal yield produced in the $j$-th $q^2$ interval,
$N^{ij}_{\rm rec}$ is the number of events generated in the $j\text{-}$th $q^{2}$ interval and reconstructed in the $i$-th $q^{2}$ interval,
and $k$ sums over all tag modes.
Details of $q^2$ divisions, the weighted signal efficiency matrices, $N^i_{\rm DT}$, $N^i_{\rm prd}$, and $\Delta\Gamma^i_{\rm msr}$ of various $q^2$ intervals  for $D^+_s\to \eta \mu^+\nu_\mu$ and $D^+_s\to \eta^\prime \mu^+\nu_\mu$ are shown in Tables 2-5 of Ref.~\cite{Supplement}, respectively.

The statistical and systematic covariance matrices are constructed as
$C_{ij}^{\rm stat} = (\frac{1}{\tau_{D_s^+}N_{\rm ST}^{\rm
    tot}})^2\sum_{\alpha}\epsilon_{i\alpha}^{-1}\epsilon_{j\alpha}^{-1}[\sigma(N^{\alpha}_{\rm
  DT})]^2$ and
$C_{ij}^{\rm syst} = \delta(\Delta \Gamma^i_{\rm msr})\delta(\Delta \Gamma^j_{\rm msr})$,
respectively,
where $\sigma(N^\alpha_{\rm DT})$ and $\delta(\Delta\Gamma^i_{\rm msr})$
are the statistical and systematic uncertainties in the $\alpha$-th and $i$-th $q^2$ interval.
The $C_{ij}^{\rm syst}$ is obtained by summing the covariance matrices
for all systematic uncertainties, where
a systematic uncertainty on $\tau_{D^+_s}$, 0.8\%~\cite{PDG2022,Aaij:2017vqj},
is included with those from the BF measurements.
The obtained $C_{ij}^{\rm stat}$ and $C_{ij}^{\rm syst}$ for various signal decays are shown in
Tables 6-7 of Ref.~\cite{Supplement}.
The final $C_{ij}$ is obtained by $C_{ij}=C_{ij}^{\rm stat}+C_{ij}^{\rm syst}$.

For each signal decay, we perform a simultaneous fit on the differential decay rates measured by the two $\eta^{(\prime)}$ sub-decays,
where the two modes are constrained to have same parameters for the hadronic FF.
Figure~\ref{fig:combine_FF} shows the results of the fits to the differential decay rates and the extracted hadronic FFs.
The systematic uncertainty of $\tau_{D^+_s}$ is correlated and the classification of other systematic uncertainties are assumed the same as the BF measurements.
The obtained parameters of hadronic FFs are summarized in Table~\ref{tab:FF_combine}.

Combining the BFs measured in this work with our measurements
${\mathcal B}_{D^+_s\to \eta e^+\nu_e}=(2.251\pm0.039_{\rm stat}\pm0.051_{\rm syst})\%$ and
${\mathcal B}_{D^+_s\to \eta^\prime e^+\nu_e}=(0.810\pm0.038_{\rm stat}\pm0.024_{\rm syst})\%$~\cite{BAM595},
we obtain
${\mathcal R}^{\eta}_{\mu/e}=0.984\pm0.028_{\rm stat}\pm0.016_{\rm syst}$ and
${\mathcal R}^{\eta^\prime}_{\mu/e}=0.989\pm0.082_{\rm stat}\pm0.034_{\rm syst}$,
which are consistent with the SM predictions~\cite{Hu:2021zmy,Ivanov:2019nqd,Cheng:2017pcq}.
In addition, we examine the ${\mathcal R}^{\eta}_{\mu/e}$ and ${\mathcal R}^{\eta^\prime}_{\mu/e}$
in various $q^2$ intervals after considering the correlated uncertainties, with results shown in the third row of Fig.~\ref{fig:combine_FF}; these are also consistent with the SM predictions.

In summary, we present for the first time the observation of $D^+_s\to \eta^\prime \mu^+\nu_\mu$ and the dynamic studies of $D^+_s\to \eta^{(\prime)}\mu^+\nu_\mu$. The BFs of $D^+_s\to \eta \mu^+\nu_\mu$ and $D^+_s\to \eta^\prime \mu^+\nu_\mu$ are measured with precision improved by  factors of 5.9 and 6.5 over the previous best measurements~\cite{PDG2022}, respectively.  Combining with the BESIII measurements of $D_s^+\to\eta^{(\prime)}e^+\nu_e$~\cite{BAM595}, we calculate the $\mathcal R_{\mu/e}^{\eta^{(\prime)}}$ ratios in separate $q^2$ intervals and in the full range.
No significant evidence of LFU violation is found with current statistics.
Combining with the BFs of $D^+ \to\eta \mu^+ \nu_\mu$~\cite{PDG2022} and
$D^+ \to\eta^\prime \mu^+ \nu_\mu$~\cite{Dptoetapmv}, we determine the $\eta-\eta^\prime$ mixing angle $\phi_{\rm P}=(40.2\pm2.1_{\rm stat}\pm0.7_{\rm syst})^\circ$.
By analyzing the $D^+_s\to \eta^{(\prime)} \mu^+\nu_\mu$ decay dynamics, 
we obtain the products $f_+^{\eta^{(\prime)}}(0)|V_{cs}|$.
Taking $|V_{cs}|$ from the SM global fit~\cite{PDG2022} as input,
we determine $f^{\eta}_+(0) = 0.463\pm0.010_{\rm stat}\pm0.008_{\rm syst}$ and $f^{\eta^{\prime}}_+(0)=0.520\pm0.038_{\rm stat}\pm0.011_{\rm syst}$ for the two-parameter series expansion. 
The results are consistent with the QCD light-cone and QCD sum rule calculations~\cite{Hu:2021zmy,Colangelo:2001cv,Azizi:2010zj,Offen:2013nma,Duplancic:2015zna}. They disfavor the lattice QCD, covariant light-cone, and covariant confined quark model calculations~\cite{Cheng:2017pcq,Ivanov:2019nqd,Bali:2014pva,Verma:2011yw,Melikhov:2000yu,Soni:2018adu} by more than $4\sigma$. 
Unlike the comparable FFs in the SL decays mediated via $c\to d e^+\nu_e$~\cite{BESIII:2018xre},  the $D^+_s\to \eta$ FFs measured in this work deviates with that of $f_+^{D\to K}(0)=0.7327\pm0.0049$ obtained via $D^0\to K^-\mu^+\nu_\mu$ ~\cite{BESIII:2018ccy} by more than $5\sigma$. This rules out the expectation for comparable FFs for $D^{0(+)}\to \bar K \mu^+\nu_\mu$ and $D^+_s\to \eta \mu^+\nu_\mu$~\cite{Koponen:2012di}.
Conversely, by taking the
$f^{\eta^{(\prime)}}_+(0)$ predicted by theory~\cite{Duplancic:2015zna} as inputs, we obtain $|V_{cs}|_\eta=0.911\pm0.020_{\rm stat}\pm0.016_{\rm syst}{^{+0.055}_{-0.053}}_{\rm theo}$ and $|V_{cs}|_{\eta^\prime}=0.907\pm0.067_{\rm stat}\pm0.019_{\rm syst}{^{+0.076}_{-0.073}}_{\rm theo}$, where the third uncertainty originates from the input FFs.

Table~\ref{sys} summarizes the sources of the systematic uncertainties in the measurements of the branching fractions of $D_s^+\to\eta^{(\prime)}\mu^+\nu_\mu$. In this table, the contributions to the systematic uncertainties listed in the top part are treated as correlated, while those in the bottom part are treated as uncorrelated.


Tables~\ref{tab:effmatrixa} and~\ref{tab:effmatrixb} give the weighted efficiency matrices averaged over all fourteen ST modes for $D^+_s\to \eta \mu^+\nu_\mu$ and $D^+_s\to \eta^\prime \mu^+\nu_\mu$, respectively.

Tables~\ref{tab:decayratea} and ~\ref{tab:decayrateb} present the numbers of the  reconstructed events $N_{\rm DT}^i$ in data obtained from the $\rm MM^2$ fits, the numbers of the  produced events $N_{\rm prd}^i$, and the measured partial decay rate $\Delta\Gamma_{\rm msr}^i$  in various $q^2$ intervals for $D^+_s\to \eta \mu^+\nu_\mu$ and $D^+_s\to \eta^\prime \mu^+\nu_\mu$, respectively.

Table~\ref{tab:cova} summarizes the statistical covariance matrices for the measured partial decay rates in different $q^2$ intervals for $D^+_s\to \eta \mu^+\nu_\mu$ and $D^+_s\to \eta^\prime \mu^+\nu_\mu$. 

Table ~\ref{tab:covb} summarizes the systematic covariance matrices for the measured partial decay
rates in different $q^2$ intervals for $D^+_s\to \eta \mu^+\nu_\mu$ and $D^+_s\to \eta^\prime \mu^+\nu_\mu$.

\caption{Relative systematic uncertainties (in \%) on the measurements of the branching fractions
of $D_s^+\to \eta \mu^+\nu_\mu$ and $D_s^+\to \eta^\prime \mu^+\nu_\mu$. The top and the bottom sections are correlated and uncorrelated, respectively. The uncertainty in the uncorrelated $\pi^\pm$ tracking is obtained as the square root of the quadratic difference of the total uncertainty in the $\pi^\pm$ tracking and the correlated portion. The last row of combined uncertainties  are total uncertainties of $D_s^+\to \eta \mu^+\nu_\mu$ and $D_s^+\to \eta^\prime \mu^+\nu_\mu$ after taking into account correlated and uncorrelated systematic uncertainties.
