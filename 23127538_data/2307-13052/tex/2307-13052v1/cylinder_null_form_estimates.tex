\begin{abstract}
	We study spacetime estimates for the wave map null form $Q_0$ on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$. By using the Lie group structure of $\mathbb{S}^3$ and Peter--Weyl theory, combined with the time-periodicity of the conformal wave equation on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$, we develop an approach inspired by a well-known calculation of Klainerman and Machedon to obtain spacetime estimates for $Q_0$ in $H^{s}$, $s>1$, in terms of initial data in $H^{s+1}(\mathbb{S}^3) \times H^{s}(\mathbb{S}^3)$. We note that this implies a conformally weighted estimate on Minkowski space with respect to a hyperboloidal foliation.

\section{Introduction}

The standard proof---via energy estimates and the Sobolev embedding theorem \cite{Soggebook}---of the local existence for a system of nonlinear wave equations on $\mathbb{R}^{1+n}$,
\begin{equation} \label{general_scalar_wave_equation} \Box_{\mathbb{R}^{1+n}} \phi = F(\phi, \partial \phi),\end{equation}
requires the initial data $(\phi, \partial_t \phi)|_{t=0}$ to be in $H^{s+1}(\mathbb{R}^n) \times H^s(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for $s > n/2$, a restriction imposed by the Sobolev embedding theorem. When the space dimension $n$ is equal to $3$, the minimum regularity required by this method is therefore $H^{5/2 + \epsilon}(\mathbb{R}^3) \times H^{3/2 + \epsilon}(\mathbb{R}^3)$. This regularity is not optimal. In \cite{PonceSideris1993}, \textsc{Ponce} and \textsc{Sideris} showed, using \textsc{Strichartz} estimates \cite{Strichartz1977} obtained by \textsc{Marshall} \cite{Marshall1981} and \textsc{Pecher} \cite{Pecher1985}, that the lower bound for the Sobolev exponent $s$ may be reduced to $s > s(\ell) = \max\{1, (3\ell-5)/(2\ell-2)\}$, where $\ell$ is the growth exponent of $\partial \phi$ in $F(\phi, \partial \phi)$. Their result shows that as $\ell \to \infty$, the above requirement of $s > 3/2$ is approached, but that for nonlinearities quadratic in $\partial \phi$, $\ell = 2$, the better bound of $s > 1$ holds. It is apparent that the structural properties of $F(\phi,\partial \phi)$ therefore play an important role in the question of regularity of solutions to \eqref{general_scalar_wave_equation}. The work \cite{PonceSideris1993} had in fact been inspired by a landmark result \cite{KlainermanMachedon1993} of \textsc{Klainerman} and \textsc{Machedon}, who had been able to show by proving suitable spacetime estimates that the exponent $s=1$ can be achieved for nonlinearities satisfying a so-called \emph{null condition}. That is, if the nonlinearity $F$ is a linear combination of the \emph{null forms}
\begin{align}
	\label{null_forms_0}
	& Q_0(\phi, \psi) = \nabla_a \phi \nabla^a \psi, \\
	\label{null_forms_ab}
	& Q_{\alpha \beta}(\phi, \psi) = \nabla_\alpha \phi \nabla_\beta \psi - \nabla_\beta \phi \nabla_\alpha \psi,
\end{align}
then a local solution exists for initial data merely in $H^2(\mathbb{R}^3) \times H^1(\mathbb{R}^3)$. The local existence results of \textsc{Ponce--Sideris} and \textsc{Klainerman--Machedon} approach sharpness in certain senses. Specifically, \textsc{Ponce} and \textsc{Sideris} show that for $\ell \geq 3$ the $H^{s(\ell)+1}(\mathbb{R}^3) \times H^{s(\ell)}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ norm of the initial data does not in general control the time of existence of solutions. For \textsc{Klainerman} and \textsc{Machedon's} result, \textsc{Lindblad} \cite{Lindblad1993,Lindblad1996} showed that for general nonlinearities (e.g. $F(\phi, \partial \phi) = (\partial_t \phi)^2$) a local solution may fail to exist for data in $H^{s+1}(\mathbb{R}^3) \times H^{s}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ when $s \leq 1$. On the other hand, for the null nonlinearity \eqref{null_forms_0} \textsc{Klainerman--Machedon} \cite{KlainermanMachedon1995a} and \textsc{Klainerman--Selberg} \cite{KlainermanSelberg1997} subsequently proved local existence for small data with $s > 1/2$, i.e. almost all the way down to the scaling-critical case of $s= 1/2$, suggesting that null nonlinearities permit the existence of local solutions for $s > 1/2$.

The null condition also plays a role in the \emph{global} existence of solutions to nonlinear wave equations. For $F(\phi, \partial \phi) = (\partial_t \phi)^2$, although local solutions exist when $s > 1$, \textsc{John} \cite{John1981} showed that they in fact exhibit finite time blow-ups even when the initial data is arbitrarily small, smooth and compactly supported. On the other hand, \textsc{Nirenberg} (\cite{Soggebook}, \S5) observed that when $F(\phi, \partial \phi) = Q_0(\phi,\phi)$, the equation can be transformed into a linear equation via the transformation $\Phi = 1 - \e^{-\phi}$, i.e. $\phi = - \log(1-\Phi)$, so that $\phi$ is global provided $\Phi$ remains small enough. This can be guaranteed by making the initial data sufficiently small. More generally, it has been known since the work of  \textsc{Klainerman} \cite{Klainerman1980,Klainerman1982,Klainerman1986} and \textsc{Christodoulou} \cite{Christodoulou1986} that for sufficiently small, sufficiently regular initial data solutions to nonlinear wave equations with null nonlinearities are global. The condition that the nonlinearity $F(\phi, \partial \phi)$ in \eqref{general_scalar_wave_equation} be a linear combination of the null forms \eqref{null_forms_0}, \eqref{null_forms_ab} has by now become known as Klainerman's classical null condition. As the nonlinearities in the Yang--Mills and Maxwell--Klein--Gordon equations are of the type $Q_{\alpha \beta}$, the null forms \eqref{null_forms_ab} are sometimes referred to as Yang--Mills type \cite{KlainermanSelberg2002}. Similarly, the null form $Q_0$ is common to wave map systems, and is occasionally referred to as the wave map null form. This taxonomy is not strict, however, since $Q_0$ for example appears both in the Yang--Mills equations in Lorenz gauge \cite{SelbergTesfahun2016} and the Einstein--Klein--Gordon equations \cite{LeFlochMa2016}.

The reason Klainerman's null condition is responsible for such dramatic improvement in the behaviour of solutions to nonlinear wave equations is tied to rates of decay of the solution along different directions. For the \emph{linear} wave equation with smooth compactly supported data in three space dimensions, the derivatives tangent to the future lightcone $\{ t = r \}$ decay like $t^{-2}$. The derivative normal to the lightcone, $(\partial_t - \partial_r) \phi$, however, decays only like $t^{-1}$. The null condition is precisely the condition that ensures that the nonlinearity $F(\phi, \partial \phi)$ (if it is quadratic in $\partial \phi$) consists of terms which have at most one derivative in the direction normal to the lightcone, and hence better decay. In Fourier space, this manifests as certain cancellations along the lightcone. The null condition has been utilised to great effect to prove, for instance, the global existence of finite energy\footnote{Finite energy data corresponds to the exponent $s=0$. For the Yang--Mills and Maxwell--Klein--Gordon equations, however, the nonlinearities are of the form $F = (-\Delta)^{-1/2}Q$, which allows one to apply the results discussed above, with $s=1$ and $F = Q$.} solutions to the Maxwell--Klein--Gordon and Yang--Mills equations \cite{KlainermanMachedon1994,KlainermanMachedon1995,SelbergTesfahun2013,SelbergTesfahun2016} and the almost optimal well-posedness of the Maxwell--Dirac system \cite{DAnconaFoschiSelberg}, to name a few examples.


Recently further progress has been made to understand the conditions on $F(\phi, \partial \phi)$ which permit the existence of global solutions to equations of the type \eqref{general_scalar_wave_equation}. We mention here the development by \textsc{Lindblad} and \textsc{Rodnianski} \cite{LindbladRodnianski2003} of the notion of a weak null condition for Einstein's equations, and \textsc{Keir's} quite general hierarchical weak null condition \cite{Keir2018,Keir2019}, based on the notion of \textsc{H\"ormander's} asymptotic systems \cite{Hormander1987,Hormander1997}. See also recent work by \textsc{Kadar} \cite{Kadar2023} on conditions on undifferentiated nonlinearities.

The key observation which allows one to obtain the improved spacetime estimates for the null nonlinearities on $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$ is the fact that in Fourier space travelling waves exhibit cancellations which depend on the angle between their spacetime frequencies. The proof then proceeds by employing a positive/negative frequency splitting and applying Plancherel's theorem in spacetime. Since standard Fourier techniques rely heavily on the structure of the real numbers, it is difficult to adapt these techniques to curved settings. Nonetheless, \textsc{Sogge} \cite{Sogge1993} and \textsc{Georgiev--Schirmer} \cite{GeorgievSchirmer1995} have studied estimates for null forms on spacetimes of the form $\mathbb{R} \times \mathcalboondox{M}$, $\mathcalboondox{M}$ a smooth compact manifold, using the theory of local Fourier integral operators, obtaining estimates equivalent to those of \cite{KlainermanMachedon1993} on a small strip $[0, t_*] \times \mathcalboondox{M}$. A physical space approach has also been introduced by \textsc{Klainerman}, \textsc{Rodnianski} and \textsc{Tao} \cite{KlainermanRodnianskiTao2002}. By contrast, in this paper we propose a global geometric approach to study spacetime estimates for the null form \eqref{null_forms_0} on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$. In particular, we exploit the Lie group structure of $\mathbb{S}^3 \simeq \mathrm{SU}(2)$ and the observation that solutions to the free conformal wave equation on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$ are periodic in time. The continuous Fourier transform is now replaced by discrete Fourier series, with irreducible representations of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ taking the place of $\e^{ix\cdot \xi}$. While in the classical case this technique yields an $H^1$ spacetime estimate for $Q_0$ in terms of initial data in $H^2(\mathbb{R}^3) \times H^1(\mathbb{R}^3)$, we find an arbitrarily small loss of regularity in the data on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$, i.e. $H^{s+1}(\mathbb{S}^3) \times H^s(\mathbb{S}^3)$ for any $s>1$, which we can trace down to the fact that irreducible representations of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ are not one-dimensional, i.e. $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ is non-abelian. Nonetheless, we are also able to control $Q_0$ in the stronger norm $H^s$ (at least for the spatial derivatives), as well as show that our estimates are valid semi-globally in time. We believe that these estimates may be useful in the study of global solutions with \emph{large} data on $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$, via methods similar to \cite{Taujanskas2019}. At the end, we note that through a conformal transformation our estimates on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$ imply estimates on $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$ with respect to a hyperboloidal foliation.

Estimates for $Q_{\alpha \beta}$, like  the ones presented in this paper for $Q_0$, appear in principle obtainable by similar methods. Here, however, we rely on the fact that the null form $Q_0$ is a scalar quantity, and moreover that $Q_0(\phi, \psi)$ is essentially $\Box(\phi \psi)$. This structure is absent for $Q_{\alpha \beta}$. Moreover, a natural geometric interpretation of $Q_{0i}(\phi, \psi)$ and $Q_{ij}(\phi ,\psi)$ is as the 1-form $\partial_t \phi \, \d \psi - \partial_t \psi \, \d \phi$ and 2-form $\d \phi \wedge \d \psi$ respectively, and these are more difficult to define the Peter--Weyl Fourier transform of. One may of course contract these with a basis of left-invariant vector fields on $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ to produce scalar quantities, but these are non-constant, which introduces other complications.


\section{Structure of paper and notation}

The structure of the paper is as follows. In \Cref{sec:main_results} we state our main results and describe, in a series of reductions, the main simpler estimate from which these will follow. In \Cref{sec:classical_estimate} we very briefly recap the classical argument of \cite{KlainermanMachedon1993} on $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$. In \Cref{sec:setup_on_cylinder,sec:estimate_on_cylinder} we set up the necessary theory and prove the main estimate on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$. In \Cref{sec:conformal_estimate} we derive the hyperboloidal conformal estimate mentioned in the introduction, and finally include a brief summary of the basic facts from Peter--Weyl theory in \Cref{sec:harmonicanalygroups}.

Our spacetime signature is $(+,-,-,-)$. We denote by $\Box$ the wave operator on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$ with the metric
\[ g_{ab}^{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3} = \d t^2 - g_{\mathbb{S}^3}, \]
where $g_{\mathbb{S}^3}$ is the standard round metric on $\mathbb{S}^3$. We will denote by $\dvol_{\mathbb{S}^3}$ the corresponding volume form on $\mathbb{S}^3$, and by $\d \mu = (2\pi^2)^{-1} \dvol_{\mathbb{S}^3}$ the normalised Haar measure on $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. To avoid ambiguity when referring to different spacetimes, we will denote by $\Box_{\mathbb{R}^{1+3}}$ the wave operator on $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$ with the standard Minkowski metric $\eta_{ab}$. Similarly, we will sometimes write $\Box_{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3}$ in place of $\Box$. We denote by $\slashed{\Delta}$ the Laplacian on $\mathbb{S}^3$ and by $\slashed{\nabla}$ the Levi-Civita connection on $\mathbb{S}^3$. On scalars, $\Box$ will therefore be equal to $\partial_t^2 - \slashed{\Delta}$. To differentiate between objects on $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$ and $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$, we will denote the Minkowskian objects (i.e. on $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$) with a tilde, e.g. $\tilde{\phi}$, and objects on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$ plainly, e.g. $\phi$. On both Minkowski space and the cylinder we will work with Fourier transforms. To this end we will denote with a hat, i.e. $\hat{\phi}$ or $\hat{\tilde{\phi}}$, the Fourier transforms in the \emph{space} variables, and with $\mathcal{F}$, e.g. $\mathcal{F}(\phi)$ or $\mathcal{F}(\tilde{\phi})$, the full spacetime Fourier transforms. To avoid ambiguity we will frequently explicitly include the frequency variables, as in $\mathcal{F}_{t\to \tau, x\to \xi}(\tilde{\phi})$. When performing estimates, by $f \la g$ we mean that $f \leq C g$ for some positive constant $C$, which may change from line to line. By $ f \simeq g$ we mean that there exists a constant $C$ such that $C^{-1} g \leq f \leq C g$. When working with Fourier series on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$, we assume a priori that the functions involved are smooth so that the series involved converge uniformly. The full function spaces are then recovered at the end by density. For a complex matrix $M$ we denote by $\vertiii{M}^2 = \operatorname{Tr}(M M^\dagger) = \sum_{i,j} |M_{ij}|^2$ its Frobenius norm. 



\section{Main results} \label{sec:main_results}

Our aim is to study spacetime estimates for the null form $Q_0(\phi,\psi) = \nabla_a \phi \nabla^a \psi$ on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$ for solutions $\phi$, $\psi$ of the wave equations
\begin{equation} \label{wave_equations} \hspace{-20pt} \Box_{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3} \phi + \phi = F, \hspace{66pt} \Box_{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3} \psi + \psi = G 	
\end{equation}
with initial data
\begin{equation} \label{initial_data} (\phi, \partial_t \phi)|_{t=0} = (f_0, f_1), \qquad \qquad (\psi, \partial_t \psi)|_{t=0} = (g_0, g_1).
\end{equation}
Before stating our results, we make a few remarks. It is natural to consider the operator $\Box_{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3} + 1$, instead of $\Box_{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3}$, for at least two reasons. First, $(\Box_{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3} + 1 )\phi = F$ is the conformal analogue of the equation $\Box_{\mathbb{R}^{1+3}} \tilde{\phi} = \tilde{F}$, where $\tilde{\phi}$ and $\phi$ are related by the rescaling $\tilde{\phi} = \Omega^{-1} \phi$, the Minkowski metric $\eta_{ab}$ is related to the metric $g^{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3}_{ab}$ on the cylinder $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$ by the conformal transformation $g^{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3}_{ab} = \Omega^2 \eta_{ab}$, and $\tilde{F} = \Omega^3 F$, where $\Omega$ is the conformal factor given in \eqref{conformal_factor}. Second, as we will see, solutions to the free equation $(\Box_{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3} + 1 )\phi = 0$ are periodic in time, which makes the time Fourier variable discrete. This will be important for our estimates since the space Fourier variables on $\mathbb{S}^3$ will also be discrete. 

We recall that the standard energy inequality for linear wave equations \eqref{wave_equations} states (see e.g. \cite{HormanderVol3}, Lemma 23.2.1) that $\forall  \sigma \in \mathbb{R}$
\begin{align*}
	\| \phi (t,\cdot)\|_{H^{\sigma+1}(\mathbb{S}^3)} &+ \| \partial_t \phi(t,\cdot) \|_{H^\sigma(\mathbb{S}^3)} \la \| f_0 \|_{H^{\sigma+1}(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \| f_1 \|_{H^\sigma(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \int_0^t \| F(s,\cdot) \|_{H^\sigma(\mathbb{S}^3)} \, \d s.
\end{align*}
The main theorem of the paper is the following.

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:master_theorem}
For any given $0 < \epsilon \ll 1$ there exists a universal constant $C(\epsilon)>0$ such that solutions $\phi$, $\psi$ of \eqref{wave_equations}--\eqref{initial_data} satisfy the estimate
	\begin{align*} \| Q_0(\phi, \psi) \|_{L^2([-\pi,\pi]; H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3))} & \leq C(\epsilon) \left( \| f_0 \|_{H^{2+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \| f_1 \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \| F(t,\cdot) \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \, \d t \right) \\
	& \hspace{25pt} \times \left( \| g_0 \|_{H^{2+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \| g_1 \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \| G(t,\cdot) \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \, \d t \right).
	\end{align*}
Here the time interval $[-\pi, \pi]$ may also be replaced with any other interval, e.g. $[0,T]$ for any $T>0$, when the constant $C(\epsilon, T)$ then depends only on $\epsilon$ and $T$.
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark}
	In fact, we can prove slightly more, and also control the time derivative of $Q_0$ in $L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3))$ at the expense of replacing the norms on $F$ and $G$ on the right-hand side with $L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3))$ instead of $L^1([-\pi,\pi];H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3))$. See \cref{main_estimate_with_time_derivative}.
\end{remark}


\begin{remark}
	From the point of view of a Picard iteration to construct a local solution to a system of nonlinear wave equations on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$ with nonlinearity $Q_0$, as in \cite{KlainermanMachedon1993,ErratumKlainermanMachedon93}, this method therefore offers an improvement of exactly a half of a derivative in comparison to the usual Sobolev embedding argument, or an arbitrarily small loss compared to the Klainerman--Machedon estimate on flat space.
\end{remark}


In several steps, we show that the estimate of \Cref{thm:master_theorem} follows from the estimate
\begin{equation}
	\label{null_form_estimates}
	\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \|Q_0(\phi,\psi)\|^2_{H^{\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \, \d t \la \| f _1 \|^2_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \| g_1 \|^2_{H^{\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)}
\end{equation}
for solutions $\phi$, $\psi$ of
\begin{align}
\label{free_equations_with_time_data}
\begin{split}
	& \Box_{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3} \phi + \phi = 0, \qquad \qquad \qquad \! \Box_{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3} \psi + \psi = 0, \qquad \text{with} \\
	& (\phi, \partial_t \phi)|_{t=0} = (0, f_1), \qquad \qquad (\psi, \partial_t \psi)|_{t=0} = (0, g_1).
\end{split}	
\end{align}
Note that for \eqref{null_form_estimates} it is obvious that $[-\pi,\pi]$ can be replaced with $[0,T]$ for any $T>0$.

\subsection{First reduction} \label{sec:first_reduction}

We first show that \eqref{null_form_estimates} implies the estimate
\begin{equation}
\label{derivative_estimates}
\int_{-\pi}^\pi \| Q_0(\phi,\psi) \|^2_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \, \d t + \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \| \partial_t Q_0(\phi,\psi) \|^2_{H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3)} \, \d t \la \| f_1 \|^2_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \| g_1 \|^2_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)}
\end{equation}
for solutions $\phi$, $\psi$ of \eqref{free_equations_with_time_data}. 

For the time derivative, we note\footnote{For $f \in H^{1}(\mathbb{S}^3)$ the operator $(1-\slashed{\Delta})^{1/2}$ may be defined by $(1-\slashed{\Delta})^{1/2} f = \sum_{m \geq 0} (m+1)^2 \operatorname{Tr}(\hat{f}(\pi_m)\pi_m)$ (see \Cref{sec:harmonicanalygroups}) and is an invertible pseudo-differential operator of order one \cite{TaylorPsiDOs1981}. Note that $(1-\slashed{\Delta})^{1/2}$ commutes with $(\Box_{\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{S}^3)} + 1) = \partial_t^2 + (1-\slashed{\Delta})$. Moreover, $\| \slashgrad f \|_{L^2} \simeq \| (1-\slashed{\Delta})^{1/2} f \|_{L^2} $. More generally, the operator $J^s = (1-\slashed{\Delta})^{s/2}$ is defined by $J^s (f) = \sum_{m\geq 0} (m+1)^{1+s} \operatorname{Tr}(\hat{f}(\pi_m) \pi_m)$.} that $\partial_t \phi^{\pm} = \pm i (1-\slashed{\Delta})^{1/2} \phi^\pm$, where $\phi^\pm$ are the positive and negative frequency parts of $\phi$ (see \eqref{discreteposnegfrequencies}), and $\phi$ is given by $\phi = \frac{1}{2i}(\phi^+ - \phi^-)$. Then, since we will prove estimate \eqref{null_form_estimates} for all parts $Q_0(\phi^\pm, \psi^\pm)$, the time derivative estimate follows from
\begin{align*}
	\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \| \partial_t Q_0(\phi, \psi) \|^2_{H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3)}  \, \d t & \la \sum_{\pm} \| Q_0(\partial_t \phi^\pm, \psi^\pm) \|^2_{L^2([-\pi,\pi]; H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3))} \\
	& \phantom{\la} + \sum_\pm \| Q_0(\phi^\pm, \partial_t \psi^\pm) \|^2_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3))} \\
	& \la \sum_\pm \| Q_0((1-\slashed{\Delta})^{1/2} \phi^\pm, \psi^\pm) \|^2_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3))} \\ 
	& \phantom{\la} + \sum_\pm \| Q_0(\phi^\pm, (1-\slashed{\Delta})^{1/2} \psi^\pm) \|^2_{L^2([-\pi,\pi]; H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3))} \\
	& \la \| Q_0((1-\slashed{\Delta})^{1/2}\phi, \psi) \|^2_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3))} \\
	& \phantom{\la} + \| Q_0(\phi, (1-\slashed{\Delta})^{1/2} \psi) \|^2_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3))} \\
	& \la \| f_1 \|^2_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \| g_1 \|^2_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)}.
\end{align*}
In particular, this also shows that if $\phi$ has data $(f_0, f_1)$ and $\psi$ has data $(0, g_1)$, then writing $\phi = \partial_t \phi_0 + \phi_1$ for $\phi_i$ such that $\Box_{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3} \phi_i + \phi_i = 0$, $(\phi_i, \partial_t \phi_i)|_{t=0} = (0, f_i)$, and using the positive/negative frequency splitting we have similarly
\begin{align}
	\label{null_form_estimates_one_side_full_data}
	\begin{split}
		\| Q_0(\phi,\psi) \|_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3))} & \la \| Q_0(\partial_t \phi_0, \psi )\|_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3))} +  \| Q_0(\phi_1, \psi )\|_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3))} \\
		& \la \left(\| f_0 \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \|f_1\|_{H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3)} \right) \| g_1 \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)}.
	\end{split}
\end{align}



For the spatial derivatives $\slashgrad_i$, we differentiate the equations \eqref{free_equations_with_time_data}. Unlike in the case of $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$, the situation here is slightly complicated by the fact that $\mathbb{S}^3$ is not flat, so the spatial derivatives $\slashed{\nabla}_i$ do not commute with the Laplacian $\slashed{\Delta}$. This means that $\slashgrad_i \phi$ now satisfies the perturbed equation $\Box_{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3} (\slashgrad_i \phi) + 3 (\slashgrad_i \phi) = 0$ with data $(0, \slashgrad_i f_1)$, and similarly for $\slashgrad_i \psi$. To deal with this, we use Duhamel's principle to write $\slashgrad_i \phi$ as the sum
\[ \slashgrad_i \phi = \Phi_1 + \Phi_2, \]
where $\Phi_1$ solves
\[ \Box_{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3} \Phi_1 + \Phi_1 = 0 \qquad \text{with} \qquad (\Phi_1, \partial_t \Phi_1)|_{t=0} = (0, \slashgrad_i f_1), \]
and
\[ \Phi_2(t,x) = \int_0^t \Phi_2^s(t-s,x) \, \d s, \]
where $\Phi_2^s$ solves
\[ \Box_{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3} \Phi_2^s + \Phi_2^s = 0 \qquad \text{with} \qquad (\Phi_2^s, \partial_t \Phi_2^s)|_{t=0} = (0, -2\slashgrad_i \phi(s,x)), \]
so that $\Phi_2$ solves
\[ \Box_{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3} \Phi_2 + \Phi_2 = -2 \slashgrad_i \phi \qquad \text{with} \qquad (\Phi_2, \partial_t \Phi_2)|_{t=0} = (0,0). \]
Then the bounds involving $\Phi_1$ (and the analogous $\Psi_1$) are immediate,
\begin{align*}
	\int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \| \slashgrad Q_0(\phi, \psi) \|^2_{H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3)} \, \d t & \la \| Q_0(\Phi_1, \psi) \|^2_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3))} + \| Q_0(\Phi_2, \psi)\|^2_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3))} \\
	& \phantom{\la} + \| Q_0(\phi, \Psi_1) \|^2_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3))} + \| Q_0(\phi, \Psi_2) \|^2_{L^2([-\pi,\pi ];H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3))} \\
	& \la \| Q_0(\Phi_2, \psi)\|^2_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3))} + \| Q_0(\phi, \Psi_2) \|^2_{L^2([-\pi,\pi ];H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3))} \\
	& \phantom{\la} +  \| f_1 \|^2_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \| g_1 \|^2_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)},
\end{align*}
so it remains to bound the forms involving $\Phi_2$ and $\Psi_2$. It turns out that this is even easier; we have, using that $\Phi_2^s(0,x) = 0$ for all $s$,
\[ Q_0(\Phi_2, \psi) = \int_0^t Q_0(\Phi_2^s(t-s,x), \psi(t,x)) \, \d s, \]
so, using \eqref{null_form_estimates_one_side_full_data} followed by the energy inequality for $\Phi_2^s$ and then the energy inequality for $\phi$, one gets
\begin{align*}
	\| Q_0(\Phi_2, \psi) \|_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3))} & \la \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \| Q_0(\Phi_2^s(t-s,x), \psi(t,x) ) \|_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3))} \, \d s	 \\
	& \la \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \left( \|\Phi_2^s(-s,\cdot)\|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \|\partial_t\Phi_2^s(-s,\cdot)\|_{H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3)} \right) \| g_1 \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \, \d s \\
	& \la \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \| \slashgrad \phi(s,\cdot) \|_{H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3)} \| g_1 \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \, \d s \\
	& \la \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \| f_1\|_{H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3)} \| g_1 \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \, \d s \\
	& \la \| f_1 \|_{H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3)} \| g_1 \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)}.
\end{align*}
The estimate for $Q_0(\phi, \Psi_2)$ is analogous. This establishes the implication \eqref{null_form_estimates}$\implies$\eqref{derivative_estimates}.




\subsection{Second reduction} \label{sec:second_reduction}

We now show that \eqref{derivative_estimates} implies \Cref{thm:master_theorem}. To do this, we must incorporate solutions $\phi$ with general data and right-hand side $(f_0,f_1,F)$. Such a solution may be written as the sum of solutions with $(f_0,0,0)$, $(0,f_1,0)$, and $(0,0,F)$, so consider first the case $F = G = 0$. If $\phi_i$, $i=1,2$, solve
\[ \Box_{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3} \phi_i + \phi_i = 0 \qquad \text{with} \qquad (\phi_i, \partial_t \phi_i)|_{t=0} = (0, f_i), \]
and similarly for $\psi_i$, then, as before, $\phi = \partial_t \phi_0 + \phi_1$ solves $\Box_{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3} \phi + \phi = 0$ with data $(f_0, f_1)$, and similarly for $\psi = \partial_t \psi_0 + \psi_1$. Then \eqref{derivative_estimates} implies \Cref{thm:master_theorem} with $F = G = 0$ by the same argument used to deduce \eqref{null_form_estimates_one_side_full_data}. To deduce the full estimate, it therefore suffices to treat the case $f_0 = f_1 = g_0 = g_1 =0$, $F, G \neq 0$. By Duhamel's principle again, the solution with zero initial data and right-hand side $F$ can be written in terms of a solution with data $(0,f_1)$ and zero right-hand side, i.e. if $\Phi_s(t,x)$ satisfies 
\[
	\Box_{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3} \Phi_s + \Phi_s = 0 \qquad \text{with} \qquad (\Phi_s, \partial_t \Phi_s)|_{t=0} = (0, F(s,x)),	
\]
then
\[ \phi(t,x) = \int_0^t \Phi_s(t-s,x) \, \d s \]
solves $\Box_{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3} \phi + \phi = F$ with data $(f_0,f_1) = (0,0)$. Similarly, we have $\Psi_s$, where
\[ \psi(t,x) = \int_0^t \Psi_s(t-s,x) \, \d s \]
satisfies $\Box_{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3} \psi + \psi = G$ with data $(g_0,g_1) = (0,0)$. Then it is easy to check, similarly to before, that
\[ Q_0(\phi,\psi)(t,x) = \int_0^t \int_0^t Q_0(\Phi_s(t-s,x), \Psi_{r}(t-r,x) ) \, \d s \, \d r. \]
For spatial derivatives it then follows trivially that
\[ \slashed{\nabla} Q_0(\phi,\psi)(t,x) = \int_0^t \int_0^t \slashed{\nabla} Q_0(\Phi_s(t-s,x), \Psi_{r}(t-r,x) ) \, \d s \, \d r. \]
We can then estimate, using the already-established \Cref{thm:master_theorem} with $F= G = 0$,
\begin{align}
	\label{spatial_derivative_estimate_null_form}
	\begin{split}
	\| \slashed{\nabla} Q_0(\phi,\psi) \|_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^{\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3))} & \la \int_{-\pi}^\pi \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \| \slashed{\nabla} Q_0(\Phi_s(t-s,x), \Psi_r(t-r,x) \|_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^{\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3))} \, \d s \, \d r \\
	& \la \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \bigg( \| \Phi_s(-s,\cdot) \|_{H^{2+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \| \partial_t \Phi_s(-s, \cdot) \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \bigg) \d s \\
	& \times \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \bigg( \| \Psi_r(-r,\cdot) \|_{H^{2+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \| \partial_t \Psi_r(-r,\cdot) \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \bigg) \d r \\
	& \la \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \| F(s,\cdot) \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \, \d s \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \| G(r,\cdot) \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \, \d r,
	\end{split}
\end{align}
where in the last line we used the energy inequality for $\Phi_s$ and $\Psi_r$, in evolution from time $-s$ (resp. $-r$) to time zero. Combining the three cases $(f_0,0,0)$, $(0,f_1,0)$ and $(0,0,F)$ (and the same for $g_i$, $G$), this establishes the implication \eqref{derivative_estimates}$\implies$\Cref{thm:master_theorem}.

\subsection{Estimate for the time derivative}

For the time derivative, on the other hand, one gets
\begin{align*}
	\partial_t Q_0(\phi, \psi)(t,x) &= F(t,x) (\partial_t \psi)(t,x) + G(t,x) (\partial_t \phi)(t,x) \\
	& +  \int_0^t \int_0^t \partial_t Q_0(\Phi_s(t-s,x), \Psi_r(t-r,x)) \, \d s \, \d r .
\end{align*}
In this, the integrated time derivative of $Q_0$ can be controlled in the same way (\eqref{spatial_derivative_estimate_null_form}) as the spatial derivatives of $Q_0$, but the appearance of the quadratic terms $F \partial_t \psi$ and $G \partial_t \phi$ and the fact that $\epsilon$ must be positive requires the \textsc{Kato--Ponce} inequality \cite{KatoPonce1988,KenigPonceVega1993}\footnote{See also \cite{BaeBiswas2015,MuscaluSchlag2013,ChristWeinstein1991,GulisashviliKon1996,Grafakos2012,GrafakosOh2013,Li2018}. Note that we need \eqref{Kato_Ponce_inequality} on $\mathbb{S}^3$, which can be obtained from the Euclidean setting using a partition of unity.}
\begin{equation}
	\label{Kato_Ponce_inequality}
	\| J^\epsilon(fg) \|_{L^r} \la \| f \|_{L^{p_1}} \| J^\epsilon g \|_{L^{q_1}} + \| J^\epsilon f \|_{L^{p_2}} \| g \|_{L^{q_2}},	
\end{equation}
where $J^\epsilon = (1-\slashed{\Delta})^{\epsilon/2}$, $\frac{1}{r} = \frac{1}{p_1} + \frac{1}{q_1} = \frac{1}{p_2} + \frac{1}{q_2}$, and $1<r<\infty$, $1< p_1$, $p_2$, $q_1$, $q_2 < \infty$. We then have
\begin{align*}
	\| F \partial_t \psi \|_{H^{\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} & = \| J^\epsilon (F \partial_t \psi) \|_{L^2(\mathbb{S}^3)} \\
	& \la \|F\|_{L^3(\mathbb{S}^3)} \| J^\epsilon(\partial_t \psi) \|_{L^6(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \| J^\epsilon(F) \|_{L^3(\mathbb{S}^3)} \| \partial_t \psi \|_{L^6(\mathbb{S}^3)} \\
	& \la \| F \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \| \partial_t \psi \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)},
\end{align*}
so, using the Sobolev embedding $H^1(\mathbb{S}^3) \hookrightarrow L^6(\mathbb{S}^3)$ and the energy inequality for $\psi$,
\begin{align*}
	\| F \partial_t \psi \|_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^{\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3))} & \la \|F\|_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3))} \| \partial_t \psi \|_{L^\infty([-\pi,\pi];H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3))} \\
	& \la \|F\|_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3))} \\
	& \times \left( \| g_0 \|_{H^{2+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \| g_1 \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \| G(t,\cdot)\|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \, \d t \right) \\
	& \la \left( \| f_0 \|_{H^{2+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \| f_1 \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \| F \|_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3))} \right) \\
	& \hspace{2pt} \times \left( \| g_0 \|_{H^{2+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \| g_1 \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \| G \|_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3))} \right),
\end{align*}
as well as the same statement for $G \partial_t \phi$. This then implies the estimate
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\label{main_estimate_with_time_derivative}
 \| Q_0(\phi,\psi) \|_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3))} &+ \| \partial_t Q_0(\phi,\psi) \|_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^{\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3))}  \\
	& \la \big( \| f_0 \|_{H^{2+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \| f_1 \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \| F \|_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3))} \big) \\
	& \hspace{1pt} \times \big( \| g_0 \|_{H^{2+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \| g_1 \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \| G \|_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3))} \big) .
\end{split}
\end{align}
The main text of this paper is therefore dedicated to proving estimate \eqref{null_form_estimates} for (all combinations of positive and negative frequency parts of) solutions of \eqref{free_equations_with_time_data}. In the following section we briefly review the main elements of the proof in $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$, as this will help to motivate the strategy on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$.




\section{Classical estimate on $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$} \label{sec:classical_estimate}

For solutions $\tilde{\phi}$, $\tilde{\psi}$ of
\begin{equation} \label{wave_equation_flat} \Box_{\mathbb{R}^{1+3}} \tilde{\phi} = 0 = \Box_{\mathbb{R}^{1+3}} \tilde{\psi} \end{equation}
on $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$ with data $(\tilde{\phi}, \partial_{\tilde{t}} \tilde{\phi})|_{\tilde{t}=0} = (0, \tilde{f})$, $(\tilde{\psi}, \partial_{\tilde{t}} \tilde{\psi})|_{\tilde{t}=0} = (0, \tilde{g})$, the key result obtained in \cite{KlainermanMachedon1993} is the estimate
\begin{equation}
\label{key_continuous_estimate}
\| \widetilde{Q}(\tilde{\phi}, \tilde{\psi}) \|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^4)} \leq C \| \tilde{f} \|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)} \| \boldsymbol{\nabla} \tilde{g} \|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)},
\end{equation}
where $\widetilde{Q}$ is any of the classical null forms \eqref{null_forms_0}, \eqref{null_forms_ab} on $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$. The method to obtain \eqref{key_continuous_estimate} may be broken down into the following steps. For the purpose of exposition we recap the case of $\widetilde{Q}_0(\tilde{\phi}, \tilde{\phi})$. We start with data $\tilde{f} \in \mathcal{S}(\mathbb{R}^3)$ such that its Fourier transform is smooth and compactly supported, and vanishes in a neighbourhood of the origin; these assumptions may be removed at the end by a density argument.


\subsection{Positive/negative frequency splitting} The Fourier transform in space of \eqref{wave_equation_flat} gives the solution $\hat{\tilde{\phi}}(\tilde{t}, \xi) = (\sin (|\xi|\tilde{t})/ |\xi| ) \hat{\tilde{f}}(\xi)$. One considers the positive and negative frequency parts of this solution,
	\[ \hat{\tilde{\phi}}^\pm(\tilde{t}, \xi) = \frac{e^{\pm i |\xi| \tilde{t}}}{|\xi|} \hat{\tilde{f}}(\xi), \]
	or
	\[ \tilde{\phi}^\pm(\tilde{t},\tilde{x}) = \frac{1}{(2 \pi)^3} \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \frac{e^{\pm i |\xi| \tilde{t}}}{|\xi|} \hat{\tilde{f}}(\xi) e^{i \tilde{x} \cdot \xi} \, \d \xi \]
	in physical space, with the original solution given by $\tilde{\phi} = \frac{1}{2i} (\tilde{\phi}^+ - \tilde{\phi}^-)$. By the bilinearity of $\widetilde{Q}_0$, it is then enough to prove the estimate \eqref{key_continuous_estimate} for every pair $\widetilde{Q}_0^{\pm, \pm} \defeq \widetilde{Q}_0(\tilde{\phi}^\pm, \tilde{\phi}^\pm)$. For brevity here we consider only $\widetilde{Q}_0^{+,+}$.
	
\subsection{Spacetime Fourier transform of $\tilde{\phi}^\pm$} Taking now the spacetime Fourier transform of, say, $\tilde{\phi}^+$ gives
	\[ \mathcal{F}_{\tilde{t} \to \tau, \, \tilde{x} \to \xi} (\tilde{\phi}^+ ) = \mathcal{F}_{\tilde{t} \to \tau} \left( \frac{e^{ i |\xi| \tilde{t}}}{|\xi|} \hat{\tilde{f}}(\xi) \right) = 2 \pi \frac{\hat{\tilde{f}}(\xi)}{|\xi|} \delta(\tau - |\xi|). \]
	Using the homogeneity of $\delta$, this can be rewritten as
	\begin{equation} \label{FT_of_initial_data} 2 \pi \frac{\hat{\tilde{f}}(\xi)}{|\xi|} \delta(\tau - |\xi|) = 4 \pi \hat{\tilde{f}}(\xi) \chi_{[0, \infty)}(\tau) \delta(\tau^2 - |\xi|^2). \end{equation}
	
\subsection{Convolution in spacetime} Using $\Box_{\mathbb{R}^{1+3}} \tilde{\phi} = 0$, one can rewrite the null form as $\widetilde{Q}_0^{+,+} = \nabla_a \tilde{\phi}^+ \nabla^a \tilde{\phi}^+ = \frac{1}{2} \Box_{\mathbb{R}^{1+3}} (\tilde{\phi}^+)^2$. The spacetime Fourier transform of $\widetilde{Q}_0^{+,+}$ is then
	\begin{equation} \label{inverse_convolution_flat_space} \mathcal{F}_{\tilde{t} \to \tau, \, \tilde{x} \to \xi}(\widetilde{Q}_0^{+,+}) = \frac{1}{2}(\tau^2 - |\xi|^2) \mathcal{F}_{\tilde{t} \to \tau, \, \tilde{x} \to \xi} ((\tilde{\phi}^+)^2)  = \frac{1}{2} (\tau^2  - |\xi|^2 ) \mathcal{F}_{\tilde{t} \to \tau, \, \tilde{x} \to \xi}(\tilde{\phi}^+) * \mathcal{F}_{\tilde{t} \to \tau, \, \tilde{x} \to \xi}(\tilde{\phi}^+). \end{equation} 
	To compute this convolution, one has the following lemma (the proof may be found in \cite{KlainermanMachedon1993}, p. 1231).
	\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:spacetime_convolution_lemma} The spacetime Fourier transform of $(\tilde{\phi}^+)^2$ is given by
	\[ \mathcal{F}_{\tilde{t} \to \tau, \, \tilde{x} \to \xi} ( (\tilde{\phi}^+)^2) = \frac{2 \pi^2}{\tau^2 - |\xi|^2} \int_{\mathbb{S}^2} \alpha^2 \hat{\tilde{f}}\left( \frac{\alpha}{2} \omega \right) \hat{\tilde{f}} \left( \xi - \frac{\alpha}{2} \omega \right) \d^2 \omega \]
	for $\tau \geq \xi$, and zero otherwise, where
	\[ \alpha = \alpha(\xi, \tau, \omega) = \frac{\tau^2 - |\xi|^2}{\tau - \xi \cdot \omega}. \]
	\end{lemma}
	 
	 \noindent A key point is that the proof of \Cref{lemma:spacetime_convolution_lemma} relies on the inverse convolution formula \eqref{inverse_convolution_flat_space} on $\mathbb{R}^4$.

\subsection{Spacetime Fourier transform of $\widetilde{Q}_0^{\pm, \pm}$ and change of variables} Using the formula from \Cref{lemma:spacetime_convolution_lemma}, one then has for $\tau \geq |\xi|$
	\[ \mathcal{F}_{\tilde{t} \to \tau, \, \tilde{x} \to \xi}(\widetilde{Q}_0^{+,+}) = \pi^2 \int_{\mathbb{S}^2} \alpha^2 \hat{\tilde{f}} \left(\frac{\alpha}{2} \omega \right) \hat{\tilde{f}} \left( \xi - \frac{\alpha}{2} \omega \right) \d^2 \omega, \]
	so by Cauchy--Schwarz
	\[ |\mathcal{F}(\widetilde{Q}_0^{+,+})|^2 \leq \pi^2 |\mathbb{S}^2| \int_{\mathbb{S}^2} \alpha^4 \left|\hat{\tilde{f}} \left(\frac{\alpha}{2} \omega \right) \right|^2 \left| \hat{\tilde{f}} \left( \xi - \frac{\alpha}{2} \omega \right) \right|^2 \d^2 \omega. \]
	One can show, from the definition of $\alpha$, that $\frac{\d \alpha}{\d \tau} \geq 1$, so changing variables $\d \tau = \frac{\d \tau}{\d \alpha} \d \alpha$, Plancherel's theorem gives
	\begin{align*}
		\| \widetilde{Q}_0^{+,+} \|^2_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^4_{\tilde{t},\tilde{x}})} & \la \| \mathcal{F}(\widetilde{Q}_0^{+,+}) \|^2_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^4_{\tau, \xi})} \\
		& \la \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \d \xi \int_0^\infty \d \tau \int_{\mathbb{S}^2} \d^2 \omega \, \alpha^4 	\left|\hat{\tilde{f}}\left(\frac{\alpha}{2} \omega \right) \right|^2 \left| \hat{\tilde{f}} \left( \xi - \frac{\alpha}{2} \omega \right) \right|^2 \\
		& \la \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \d \xi \int_0^\infty \d \alpha \int_{\mathbb{S}^2} \d^2 \omega \, \alpha^4 \left|\hat{\tilde{f}}\left(\frac{\alpha}{2} \omega \right) \right|^2 \left| \hat{\tilde{f}} \left( \xi - \frac{\alpha}{2} \omega \right) \right|^2.
	\end{align*}
	Finally, reinstating the variable $\xi ' = \frac{\alpha}{2} \omega$, $\d \xi' = \alpha^2 \, \d \alpha \, \d^2 \omega$ and using Plancherel again, one arrives at
	\begin{align*}
		\| \widetilde{Q}_0^{+,+} \|^2_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^4)} & \la \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \d \xi \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \d \xi' \, |\xi'|^2 |\hat{\tilde{f}}(\xi - \xi')|^2 |\hat{\tilde{f}}(\xi')|^2 \\
		& \la \| \tilde{f} \|^2_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)} \| \boldsymbol{\nabla} \tilde{f} \|^2_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)}.	
	\end{align*}
	An important point in this step is that the reinstating of the variable $\xi'$ involves mixing the time and space Fourier variables since $\alpha = \alpha(\xi, \tau, \omega)$. The parts $\widetilde{Q}_0^{+,-}$ and $\widetilde{Q}_0^{-,-}$ may be estimated similarly, and one concludes that
	\[ \| \widetilde{Q}_0(\tilde{\phi}, \tilde{\phi})\|_{L^2(\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^3)} \la \| \tilde{f} \|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)} \| \boldsymbol{\nabla} \tilde{f} \|_{L^2(\mathbb{R}^3)}. \]





\section{Setup on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$} \label{sec:setup_on_cylinder}

Consider now two solutions $\phi$, $\psi$ to the free equations
\begin{align}
\label{free_equations_with_time_data_2}
\begin{split}
	& \Box_{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3} \phi + \phi = 0, \hspace{61pt} \Box_{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3} \psi + \psi = 0, \qquad \text{with} \\
	& (\phi, \partial_t \phi)|_{t=0} = (0, f), \qquad \qquad (\psi, \partial_t \psi)_{t=0} = (0, g).
\end{split}
\end{align}
We prove the following.

\begin{theorem} \label{thm:basic_estimate} For any $0 < \epsilon \ll 1$ solutions $\phi$, $\psi$ to \eqref{free_equations_with_time_data_2} satisfy the estimate
\[ \| Q_0(\phi, \psi) \|^2_{L^2([-\pi,\pi]; H^\epsilon (\mathbb{S}^3))} \la \| f \|^2_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \| g \|^2_{H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3)}. \]
\end{theorem}

\begin{remark} We mention here that using the same technique one can also obtain the estimates
\[ \| Q_0(\phi, \psi) \|^2_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^{\epsilon_1}(\mathbb{S}^3))} \la \| f \|^2_{H^{s_1}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \| g \|^2_{H^{s_2}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \]
for any $s_1$, $s_2$ such that $s_1 + s_2 = 1 + 2\epsilon_2$, where $\epsilon_1$ and $\epsilon_2$ need not be equal. In particular, $\epsilon_1$ may be larger than $\epsilon_2$, provided both are sufficiently small and $\epsilon_2 > 0$. In view of \Cref{sec:first_reduction,sec:second_reduction}, we focus on the case $\epsilon_1 = \epsilon_2$ and $s_1 - s_2 = 1$.
\end{remark}


As noted above, the final step in the derivation of the classical estimate on $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$ mixes time and space Fourier variables. On $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$, the spatial Fourier variables will be discrete since $\mathbb{S}^3$ is compact, however the temporal Fourier variable is in general continuous. As mentioned, to deal with this we use the time periodicity of \eqref{free_equations_with_time_data_2}.

\subsection{Time periodicity}

Solutions to \eqref{free_equations_with_time_data_2} are periodic in time; this may be seen at the level of twistor formulae (see \S9.4 of \cite{spinorsandspacetime2}), or as follows. Suppose a $C^\infty(\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3)$ solution to \eqref{free_equations_with_time_data_2} is given. Taking the operator-valued Fourier transform in the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ variables, one has
\[ \partial_t^2 \hat{\phi}(\pi_m) + m (m+2) \hat{\phi}(\pi_m) + \hat{\phi}(\pi_m) = 0, \]
where $m(m+2) +1 = (m+1)^2$ is a perfect square. This has the general solution
\begin{equation} \label{general_free_mode_cylinder} \hat{\phi}(\pi_m)(t) = A_m \sin ( (m+1) t) + B_m \cos ( (m+1)t ) \end{equation}
for constant $(m+1) \times (m+1)$ matrices $A_m$ and $B_m$, and in particular for every $ m \in \mathbb{N}_0$ the mode $\hat{\phi}(\pi_m)(t)$ is $2 \pi$-periodic in $t$. By the Peter--Weyl theorem, the full solution $\phi$ can be recovered from the Fourier series
\[ \phi(t,x) = \sum_{m \geq 0} (m+1) \operatorname{Tr}( \hat{\phi}(\pi_m)(t) \pi_m(x) ), \]
where $(t,x) \in \mathbb{R} \times \mathrm{SU}(2)$, and is also $2\pi$-periodic in $t$. It follows that solutions to \eqref{free_equations_with_time_data_2} can be identified with a subspace of the space of real-valued functions on $\mathbb{S}^1 \times \mathbb{S}^3 \simeq \mathrm{U}(1) \times \mathrm{SU}(2)$.



\subsection{Positive/negative frequency splitting} In the case of data $(\phi, \partial_t \phi)|_{t=0} = (0,f)$, the solution \eqref{general_free_mode_cylinder} becomes
\[ \hat{\phi}(\pi_m) = \frac{\sin( (m+1)t )}{(m+1)} \hat{f}(\pi_m). \]
In contrast to the continuous case, the denominator here never vanishes, so there is no need to consider a subspace of data $\hat{f}$ which vanishes around the origin. Straight away we then have
\[ \phi(t,x) = \sum_{m \geq 0} (m+1) \operatorname{Tr}( \hat{\phi}(\pi_m)(t) \pi_m(x) )  = \sum_{m \geq 0} \sin ((m+1)t) \operatorname{Tr}(\hat{f}(\pi_m) \pi_m(x) ). \]
Analogously to before, we define the positive and negative frequency parts of $\phi$ by
\begin{equation} \label{discreteposnegfrequencies} \phi^\pm(t,x) = \sum_{m \geq 0} e^{\pm i (m+1)t} \operatorname{Tr}(\hat{f}(\pi_m) \pi_m(x) ). \end{equation}
These solve $\Box \phi^\pm + \phi^\pm = 0$ and determine the full solution via $\phi = \frac{1}{2i}(\phi^+ - \phi^-)$, so we restrict our analysis to $\phi^\pm$.


\subsection{Spacetime Fourier transform of \texorpdfstring{$\phi^\pm$}{phi+}}

To write $\phi^\pm$ as a spacetime Fourier series, we use the periodicity of $\phi^\pm(t,x)$ in $t$. These can then be written as standard Fourier series on $\mathbb{R}/2 \pi \mathbb{R} \simeq \mathbb{S}^1 \simeq \mathrm{U}(1)$,
\[ \phi^\pm(t,x) = \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} e^{ int} \phi^{\pm}_n(x), \]
where, by comparing to \eqref{discreteposnegfrequencies},
\begin{equation} \label{S1Fourierphi} \phi^{\pm}_n(x) = \begin{cases} \operatorname{Tr}(\hat{f}(\pi_{\pm n-1}) \pi_{\pm n-1}(x)) \qquad \text{for } \pm n \geq 1, \\ \hspace{50pt} 0 \hspace{75pt} \text{otherwise}. \end{cases} \end{equation}
Hence the spacetime Fourier coefficient $\mathcal{F}(\phi^\pm)$ of $\phi^\pm$ is
\[ \mathcal{F}(\phi^\pm)(\pi_m)_n = \frac{1}{(m+1)} \hat{f}(\pi_m) \delta_{m, \pm n-1}, \]
where $m \geq 0$ is the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ index, and $n$ is the $\mathrm{U}(1)$ index.





\subsection{Spacetime Fourier transform of \texorpdfstring{$Q_0^{\pm,\pm}$}{Q_0}}

A hurdle one encounters here is that an inverse convolution theorem \eqref{inverse_convolution_flat_space} is unavailable in the non-abelian setting. Indeed, given a non-abelian Lie group $\mathrm{G}$ and two functions $f, \, g : \mathrm{G} \to \mathbb{R}$, one may define their convolution by 
\[ (f * g)(x) = \int_{\mathrm{G}} f(y) g(x y^{-1}) \, \d \mu(y), \]
from which it follows that
\[ \widehat{(f*g)}(\pi) = \hat{f}(\pi) \hat{g}(\pi). \]
This is the \emph{forward} convolution theorem. But because $\hat{f}(\pi)$ and $\hat{g}(\pi)$ are operators, there is in general no natural way of defining the convolution $\hat{f}(\pi) * \hat{g}(\pi)$, as there is no group structure on the unitary dual $\hat{\mathrm{G}}$. Instead, we proceed in a different way to obtain the spacetime Fourier transform of $Q_0^{\pm,\pm}$, by using the commutativity of the $\mathrm{U}(1)$ factor of $\mathrm{U}(1) \times \mathrm{SU}(2)$. The first step is to express $\mathcal{F}(Q_0^{\pm,\pm})$ in terms of $\mathcal{F}(\phi^\pm \psi^\pm)$.


\begin{lemma} The spacetime Fourier coefficients $\mathcal{F}(Q_0^{\pm,\pm})(\pi_m)_n$ of $Q_0^{\pm,\pm} = Q_0(\phi^\pm, \psi^\pm)$ are given by
\[ \mathcal{F}(Q_0^{\pm,\pm})(\pi_m)_n = \frac{1}{2} ( 1 + (m+1)^2 - n^2 ) \mathcal{F}(\phi^\pm \psi^\pm)(\pi_m)_n. \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} This follows from the identity
\[ Q_0(\phi^\pm, \psi^\pm) = \phi^\pm \psi^\pm + \frac{1}{2} \Box (\phi^\pm \psi^\pm) \]
and the fact that $\Box$ is a formally self-adjoint operator on $[-\pi,\pi] \times \mathbb{S}^3$. Taking the spacetime Fourier transform of this, we obtain
\begin{align*}
	\mathcal{F}(Q_0^{\pm,\pm})(\pi_m)_n & = \mathcal{F}(\phi^\pm \psi^\pm)(\pi_m)_n + \frac{1}{4\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \int_{\mathrm{SU}(2)} \e^{-int} \pi_m(x^{-1}) (\Box(\phi^\pm \psi^\pm))(t,x) \, \d \mu \, \d t \\
	& = \mathcal{F}(\phi^\pm \psi^\pm)(\pi_m)_n + \frac{1}{4\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \int_{\mathrm{SU}(2)}(\phi^\pm \psi^\pm)(t,x) \Box( \e^{-int} \pi_m(x^{-1}) ) \, \d \mu \, \d t \\
	& = \frac{1}{2} ( 1+ (m+1)^2 - n^2) \mathcal{F}(\phi^\pm \psi^\pm)(\pi_m)_n.
\end{align*}
\end{proof}

\noindent As mentioned, while an inverse convolution theorem on the whole of $\mathrm{U}(1) \times \mathrm{SU}(2)$ is not available, it is still available on the abelian $\mathrm{U}(1)$ factor. Specifically, the $\mathrm{U}(1)$-Fourier coefficients of $(\phi^\pm \psi^\pm)$ are
\[ (\phi^\pm \psi^\pm)_n = \sum_{l \in \mathbb{Z}} \phi^\pm_l \psi^\pm_{n-l}, \]
so that, using \eqref{S1Fourierphi},
\begin{equation} \label{S1Fourierproduct++} (\phi^+ \psi^+)_n(x) = \sum_{l  = 1}^{n-1} \operatorname{Tr}(\hat{f}(\pi_{l-1}) \pi_{l-1}(x) ) \operatorname{Tr}(\hat{g}(\pi_{n-l-1}) \pi_{n-l-1}(x) )
\end{equation}
for the $(+,+)$ product and
\begin{equation} \label{S1Fourierproduct+-} 
	(\phi^+ \psi^-)_n(x) = \sum_{l = n+1}^\infty \operatorname{Tr}(\hat{f}(\pi_{l-1}) \pi_{l-1}(x)) \operatorname{Tr}(\hat{g}(\pi_{l-n-1}) \pi_{l-n-1} (x)) 
\end{equation}
for the $(+,-)$ product. The expressions for the $(-,+)$ and $(-,-)$ products are similar. Integrating \eqref{S1Fourierproduct++}, \eqref{S1Fourierproduct+-} against $\pi_m(x^{-1}) \, \d \mu(x)$, we have
\[ \mathcal{F}(\phi^+ \psi^+)(\pi_m)_n = \sum_{l=1}^{n-1} \varpi_l^{+,+}(\pi_m)_n ~~\quad \text{and} ~~\quad \mathcal{F}(\phi^+ \psi^-)(\pi_m)_n = \sum_{l = n+1}^\infty \varpi^{+,-}_l(\pi_m)_n, \]
where
\begin{align*} \varpi^{+,+}_l (\pi_m)_n & \defeq \int_{\mathrm{SU}(2)} \operatorname{Tr}(\hat{f}(\pi_{l-1}) \pi_{l-1}(x) ) \operatorname{Tr}(\hat{g}(\pi_{n-l-1}) \pi_{n-l-1}(x) ) \pi_m (x^{-1} ) \, \d \mu (x) \\
& = \hat{f}(\pi_{l-1})_{ji} \hat{g}(\pi_{n-l-1})_{sr} \int_{\mathrm{SU}(2)} (\pi_{l-1})_{ij} (\pi_{n-l-1})_{rs} \pi_m^\dagger \, \d \mu.
\end{align*}
and
\[ \varpi^{+,-}_l(\pi_m)_n = \hat{f}(\pi_{l-1})_{ji} \hat{g}(\pi_{l-n-1})_{sr} \int_{\mathrm{SU}(2)} (\pi_{l-1})_{ij} (\pi_{l-n-1})_{rs} \pi_m^\dagger \, \d \mu. \]
Computing $\varpi_l^{+,\pm}(\pi_m)_n$ encapsulates the key novelty of this calculation as compared to the $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$ case: as $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ is non-abelian, the tensor product $\pi_l \otimes \pi_{n-l}$ is not isomorphic to a single irreducible representation $\pi_n$. Instead, for $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ the product $\pi_a \otimes \pi_b$ is isomorphic to the Clebsch--Gordan expansion
\begin{equation} \label{abstractCG} \pi_a \otimes \pi_b = \bigoplus_{k=0}^{\min\{a,b \}} \pi_{|a-b| + 2k }
\end{equation}
(see, for example, \S7 of \cite{Faraut2008}). For calculation we will need the expansion \eqref{abstractCG} with an explicit choice of the representations $\pi_m$; we use \textsc{Wigner's} D-matrices \cite{Wigner1959}.


\subsection{Wigner's D-matrices and Clebsch--Gordan expansions}

Wigner's D-matrices are explicit unitary matrix representations of $\pi_m$, $m \geq 0$. The rows and columns of $(\pi_m)_{ij}$ are labelled by the integers and half-integers
\[ i, j = - \frac{m}{2}, - \frac{m}{2} + 1, \dots , \frac{m}{2} - 1, \frac{m}{2}, \]
and a general expression for all $(\pi_m)_{ij}(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$, where $(\alpha, \beta, \gamma)$ are the Euler angles parametrizing $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, can be found on p. 167 of \cite{Wigner1959}. As an example, the first three representations are given by
\begingroup
\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.8}
\[ \pi_0 = 1, \qquad  \pi_1 = \pm \left( \begin{array}{lr} \e^{-\frac{1}{2} i \alpha} \left( \cos \frac{1}{2} \beta \right) \e^{-\frac{1}{2} i \gamma} & - \e^{-\frac{1}{2} i \alpha} \left( \sin \frac{1}{2} \beta \right) \e^{\frac{1}{2} i \gamma} \\ \e^{\frac{1}{2} i \alpha} \left( \sin \frac{1}{2} \beta \right) \e^{- \frac{1}{2} i \gamma} & \e^{\frac{1}{2} i \alpha} \left( \cos \frac{1}{2} \beta \right) \e^{\frac{1}{2} i \gamma}  \end{array} \right), \]
and
\[ \pi_2 = \left( \begin{array}{lcr} \e^{-i\alpha} \frac{1}{2}(1+\cos\beta) \e^{- i \gamma} & - \e^{-i\alpha} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sin \beta & \e^{-i \alpha} \frac{1}{2}(1- \cos \beta) \e^{i \gamma} \\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} (\sin \beta ) \e^{-i \gamma} & \cos \beta & -\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} ( \sin \beta) \e^{i \gamma} \\ \e^{i \alpha} \frac{1}{2} ( 1 - \cos \beta) \e^{-i\gamma} & \e^{i\alpha} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \sin \beta & \e^{i\alpha} \frac{1}{2} ( 1+ \cos \beta) \e^{i\gamma} \end{array} \right). \]
\endgroup
Here $\alpha, \beta, \gamma \in [-\pi, \pi]$, and the rows and columns of $\pi_1$ are labelled by $-\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}$, and of $\pi_2$ by $-1, 0, 1$. In terms of Wigner's D-matrices, an indexed version of the Clebsch--Gordan expansion \eqref{abstractCG} is given by
\begin{align} \begin{split} \label{indexCG} (\pi_a)_{ij}(\pi_b)_{rs} &= \sum_{k = 0}^{\min\{a,b\}} \left\langle\left. \frac{a}{2} \, i \, \frac{b}{2} \, r \, \right| \frac{|a-b| + 2k}{2} \, (i+r) \right\rangle \\
& \hspace{36pt} \times \left\langle\left. \frac{a}{2} \, j \, \frac{b}{2} \, s \, \right| \frac{|a-b| + 2k}{2} \, (j+s) \right\rangle (\pi_{|a-b| + 2k})_{(i+r)(j+s)}, 
\end{split}	
\end{align}
where $\langle j_1 \, m_1 \, j_2 \, m_2 | j_3 \, m_3 \rangle $ are the standard Clebsch--Gordan coefficients of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. The Clebsch--Gordan coefficients are probability amplitudes, so in particular they are uniformly bounded by 1 in all six variables $j_1, j_2, j_3, m_1, m_2, m_3$. They do not vanish only if $-j_1 \leq m_1 \leq j_1$, $-j_2 \leq m_2 \leq j_2$, $-j_3 \leq m_3 \leq j_3$, and $m_1 + m_2 = m_3$. They further obey the orthogonality relations
\begin{align}
	\label{orth1} & \sum_{j_3} \sum_{m_3} \langle j_1 \, m_1 \, j_2 \, m_2 | j_3 \, m_3 \rangle \langle j_1 \, m_1' \, j_2 \, m_2' | j_3 \, m_3 \rangle = \delta_{m_1, m_1'} \delta_{m_2, m_2'}, \\
	\label{orth2} & \sum_{m_1} \sum_{m_2} \langle j_1 \, m_1 \, j_2 \, m_2 | j_3 \, m_3 \rangle \langle j_1 \, m_1 \, j_2 \, m_2 | j_3' \, m_3' \rangle = \delta_{j_3, j_3'} \delta_{m_3, m_3'},
\end{align}
where in \eqref{orth1} the sums run over $|j_1 - j_2| \leq j_3 \leq j_1 + j_2$ and $-j_3 \leq m_3 \leq j_3$, and in \eqref{orth2} the sums run over $-j_{1,2} \leq m_{1,2} \leq j_{1,2}$. Using \eqref{indexCG} and the Schur orthogonality relations, we therefore have
\begin{align*} & \int_{\mathrm{SU}(2)} (\pi_{l-1})_{ij} ( \pi_{n-l-1})_{rs} (\pi^\dagger_m)_{pq} \, \d \mu \\
 & = \sum_{k=0}^{\min\{l-1, n-l-1\}} \left\langle \left.\frac{l-1}{2} \, i \, \frac{n-l-1}{2} \, r \right| \frac{|n-2l| + 2k}{2} \, (i+r) \right\rangle \\
 & \hspace{40pt} \times \left\langle \left.\frac{l-1}{2} \, j \, \frac{n-l-1}{2} \, s \right| \frac{|n-2l| + 2k}{2} \, (j+s) \right\rangle \int_{\mathrm{SU}(2)} ( \pi_{|n-2l| + 2k })_{(i+r)(j+s)} (\pi^\dagger_m)_{pq} \, \d \mu \\
 & = \sum_{k=0}^{\min\{l-1, n-l-1\}} \left\langle \left.\frac{l-1}{2} \, i \, \frac{n-l-1}{2} \, r \right| \frac{|n-2l| + 2k}{2} \, (i+r) \right\rangle \\
 & \hspace{40pt} \times \left\langle \left.\frac{l-1}{2} \, j \, \frac{n-l-1}{2} \, s \right| \frac{|n-2l| + 2k}{2} \, (j+s) \right\rangle \frac{1}{(m+1)} \delta_{i+r, p} \delta_{j+s, q} \delta_{|n-2l| + 2k, m}
\end{align*}
provided
\[ |n-2l| \leq m \leq |n-2l| + 2 \min\{ l - 1, n-l-1 \} \iff |n-2l| \leq m \leq n - 2 \]
so that $\pi_m$ is in the range of the Clebsch--Gordan expansion \eqref{indexCG}, and
\[ \frac{m - |n-2l|}{2} \in \mathbb{Z} \iff m \equiv n \mod 2. \]
We therefore obtain
\begin{align} \begin{split} \label{SU2convolution} (\varpi^{+,+}_l(\pi_m)_n)_{pq} &= \frac{1}{(m+1)} \hat{f}(\pi_{l-1})_{ji} \hat{g}(\pi_{n-l-1})_{(q-j)(p-i)} \\
& \times \left\langle\left. \frac{l-1}{2} \, i \, \frac{n-l-1}{2} \,  (p-i) \right| \frac{m}{2} \, p \right\rangle \left\langle\left. \frac{l-1}{2} \, j \, \frac{n-l-1}{2} \, (q-j) \right| \frac{m}{2} \, q \right\rangle \chi_1 \chi_2,
\end{split}
\end{align}
where $\chi_1 = \chi(|n-2l| \leq m \leq n -2 )$ and $\chi_2 = \chi(m \equiv n \mod 2)$, where $\chi$ is the indicator function. Similarly, we obtain
\begin{align}
	\begin{split}
	\label{varpi_plus_minus}
		(\varpi^{+,-}_l(\pi_m)_n)_{pq} & = \frac{1}{(m+1)} \hat{f}(\pi_{l-1})_{ji} \hat{g}(\pi_{l-n-1})_{(q-j)(p-i)} \\
		& \times \left\langle \left. \frac{l-1}{2} \, i \, \frac{l-n-1}{2} \, (p-i) \, \right| \, \frac{m}{2} \, p \right\rangle \left\langle \left. \frac{l-1}{2} \, j \, \frac{l-n-1}{2} \, (q-j) \, \right| \, \frac{m}{2} \, q \right\rangle \chi_2 \chi_3,
	\end{split}
\end{align}
where $\chi_3 = \chi(|n| \leq m \leq -n +2(l-1))$, and where in both cases for a well-defined representation $\pi_{l-1}$ we require $l \geq 1$. The presence of $\chi_1$ and $\chi_3$ encodes the multi-dimensional nature of the irreducible representations of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ and the fact that the product $\pi_l \otimes \pi_{n-l}$ ``smears" over a range of representations.


 
\section{Estimate for $Q_0$} \label{sec:estimate_on_cylinder}

In this section we proceed to prove \Cref{thm:basic_estimate}. Noting that $-4Q_0(\phi, \psi) = Q_0^{+,+} - Q_0^{+,-} - Q_0^{-,+} + Q_0^{-,-}$, it is therefore enough to estimate each of the four parts $Q_0^{\pm,\pm}$. Clearly the estimates for $Q_0^{+,+}$ and $Q_0^{-,-}$ are entirely analogous, as are those for $Q_0^{+,-}$ and $Q_0^{-,+}$. It is therefore enough to show that $Q_0^{+,+}$ and $Q_0^{+,-}$ are suitably controlled. We record the following two auxiliary lemmas.

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:behaviour_lambda} For any fixed $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $0 <\epsilon \leq 1$ the function $\lambda: \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0} \to \mathbb{R}$ defined by
\[ \lambda(m; n, \epsilon) = \frac{(1+(m+1)^2 - n^2)^2}{(m+1)^{1-\epsilon}} \]
is decreasing for $m \in [0, \sqrt{n^2-1}-1)$, has a global minimum $\lambda(m_*) = 0$ at $m_* = \sqrt{n^2-1} -1$, and is increasing for $m \in  (\sqrt{n^2-1}-1, \infty)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
This follows directly from computing the derivative in $m$,
\[ \lambda'(m; n, \epsilon) = \frac{((3+\epsilon)(m+1)^2 + (1-\epsilon)(n^2 - 1))}{(m+1)^{2-\epsilon}} ( 1 + (m+1)^2 - n^2) , \]
where the first factor in the above is manifestly positive for all $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, $0 < \epsilon \leq 1$ and $m \geq 0$. 	
\end{proof}


We also have the following discrete, Fourier-side version of Young's inequality for convolutions.

\begin{lemma} \label{lemma:discrete_convolution_bound_CG_orthogonality} For the matrices $\varpi^{+,\pm}_l(\pi_m)_n$ given by \eqref{SU2convolution} and \eqref{varpi_plus_minus} we have the bounds
\[ \sum_{m \geq 0} \vertiii{(m+1) \varpi^{+,\pm}_l(\pi_m)_n}^2 \leq \vertiii{\hat{f}(\pi_{l-1})}^2 \vertiii{\hat{g}(\pi_{\pm(n-l)-1})}^2. \]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof} We write down the proof for $\varpi^{+,+}_l(\pi_m)_n$, the calculation for $\varpi^{+,-}_l(\pi_m)_n$ being the same. For more efficient notation, we write here
\[ \sum_{m \geq 0} \chi_1 \chi_2 = \sum_m \]
 and 
\[ \langle j_1 \, m_1 \, j_2 \, m_2 \, | \, j_3 \, m_3 \rangle = \mathcal{C}^{(j_1 j_2)}_{j_3 m_1 m_2}, \]
with the understanding that the ranges of the sums below are restricted to the ranges in which the Clebsch--Gordan coefficients involved are non-zero. Then the orthogonality relations \eqref{orth1} and \eqref{orth2} read
\begin{align}
	\label{orth1'} & \sum_{j_3} \sum_{m_3} \mathcal{C}^{(j_1 j_2)}_{j_3 m_1 m_2} \mathcal{C}^{(j_1 j_2)}_{j_3 m'_1 m_2'} = \delta_{m_1, m_1'} \delta_{m_2, m_2'}, \\
	\label{orth2'} & \sum_{m_1} \sum_{m_2} \mathcal{C}^{(j_1 j_2)}_{j_3 m_1 m_2}  \mathcal{C}^{(j_1 j_2)}_{j'_3 m_1 m_2} = \delta_{j_3, j_3'} .
\end{align}
Explicitly expanding the Frobenius norm squared of $(m+1)\varpi^{+,+}_l(\pi_m)_n$, we have 
\begin{align*}
	\sum_{m \geq 0} & \vertiii{(m+1) \varpi^{+,+}_l(\pi_m)_n}^2 = \sum_m \sum_{p, q} \sum_{i,j} \sum_{i',j'} \hat{f}(\pi_{l-1})_{ji} \overline{\hat{f}(\pi_{l-1})}_{j'i'}  \\
	& \times \hat{g}(\pi_{n-l-1})_{(q-j)(p-i)} \overline{\hat{g}(\pi_{n-l-1})}_{(q-j')(p-i')} \mathcal{C}^{\left( \frac{l-1}{2} \frac{n-l-1}{2} \right)}_{\frac{m}{2} i (p-i)} \mathcal{C}^{\left( \frac{l-1}{2} \frac{n-l-1}{2} \right)}_{\frac{m}{2} i' (p-i')} \mathcal{C}^{\left( \frac{l-1}{2} \frac{n-l-1}{2} \right)}_{\frac{m}{2} j (q-j)} \mathcal{C}^{\left( \frac{l-1}{2} \frac{n-l-1}{2} \right)}_{\frac{m}{2} j' (q-j')} \\

\subsection{Estimate for $Q_0^{+,+}$}

By Plancherel's theorem, we compute for $0 < \epsilon \ll 1$ (noting that we must have $n \geq 2$ due to $\chi_1 = \chi(|n-2l| \leq m \leq n -2)$)

\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\label{Q0++estimate}
 \| Q_0^{+,+} \|^2_{L^2(\mathbb{S}^1; H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3))} & \simeq \sum_{n \geq 2} \sum_{m \geq 0} (m+1)^{1+2\epsilon} \vertiii{\mathcal{F}(Q_0^{+,+})(\pi_m)_n}^2 \\\
& \simeq \sum_{n \geq 2} \sum_{m \geq 0} (1+(m+1)^2 - n^2 )^2 ( m+ 1)^{1+2\epsilon} \vertiii{\mathcal{F}(\phi^+ \psi^+)(\pi_m)_n}^2 \\
& \simeq \sum_{n \geq 2} \sum_{m \geq 0} ( 1 + (m+1)^2 - n^2 )^2 ( m + 1)^{-1+2\epsilon} \vertiii{\sum_{l=1}^{n-1} (m+1) \varpi^{+,+}_l(\pi_m)_n}^2
\end{split}
\end{align}
At this stage we perform the splitting
\begin{align*} \vertiii{\sum_{l=1}^{n-1} (m+1) \varpi^{+,+}_l(\pi_m)_n }^2 &\leq \sum_{l=1}^{n-1} \frac{(1+|n-2l|)^{1-2\epsilon}l^{1+2\epsilon}}{(n-l)^{1-2\epsilon}} \vertiii{(m+1) \varpi^{+,+}_l(\pi_m)_n}^2 \\
& \times \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \frac{(n-k)^{1-2\epsilon}}{(1+|n-2k|)^{1-2\epsilon}k^{1+2\epsilon}},
\end{align*}
and show that the last factor in the above converges to a finite constant (dependent on $\epsilon$). 

\begin{lemma} \label{lem:converging_sum_factor_Q0++} For any $0 < \epsilon \ll 1$ the sum 
	\[ \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \frac{(n-k)^{1-\epsilon}}{(1+|n-2k|)^{1-\epsilon}k^{1+\epsilon}} \]
converges as $n \to \infty$.
\end{lemma}


\begin{proof} Split the sum into two parts,
	\[ \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} \frac{(n-k)^{1-\epsilon}}{(1+|n-2k|)^{1-\epsilon}k^{1+\epsilon}} = \left[ \sum_{1 \leq k \leq \frac{n}{2} - 1} + \sum_{\frac{n}{2} -1 < k \leq n-1} \right] \frac{(n-k)^{1-\epsilon}}{(1+|n-2k|)^{1-\epsilon}k^{1+\epsilon}}, \]
	and treat the range $\frac{n}{2} -1 < k \leq n-1$ first. Changing variables $k - \frac{n}{2} = r$, one obtains
	\begin{align*}
		\sum_{\frac{n}{2} -1 < k \leq n-1} \frac{(n-k)^{1-\epsilon}}{(1+|n-2k|)^{1-\epsilon} k^{1+\epsilon}} & = \sum_{r=0}^{\frac{n}{2}-1} \left( \frac{\frac{n}{2}-r}{1+2r} \right)^{1-\epsilon} \frac{1}{(2r + n)^{1+\epsilon}} \\
			& \la \sum_{r=0}^{\frac{n}{2} - 1} \left( \frac{n-2r}{1+ 2r} \right)^{1-\epsilon} \frac{1}{(2r+n)^{1+\epsilon}} \\
			& = \sum_{r=0}^{\frac{n}{2}-1} \left( \frac{n-2r}{n+2r} \right)^{1-\epsilon} \frac{1}{(2r+1)^{1-\epsilon}} (n+2r)^{1-\epsilon} (n+2r)^{-1-\epsilon} \\
			& \leq \sum_{r=0}^{\frac{n}{2}-1} \frac{1}{(2r+1)^{1-\epsilon}} \frac{1}{(n+2r)^{2\epsilon}} \\
			& \leq \sum_{r=0}^{\frac{n}{2}-1} \frac{1}{(2r+1)^{1+\epsilon}} \\
			& \leq \zeta(1+\epsilon) < \infty.
	\end{align*}
	For the other part of the range $1 \leq k \leq \frac{n}{2} -1 $, put $r = \frac{n}{2} - k$. Then
	\begin{align*}
	\sum_{1 \leq k \leq \frac{n}{2} - 1}  \frac{(n-k)^{1-\epsilon}}{(1+|n-2k|)^{1-\epsilon}k^{1+\epsilon}}	 & \la \sum_{r=1}^{\frac{n}{2} -1} \left( \frac{n+2r}{1+2r} \right)^{1-\epsilon} \frac{1}{(n-2r)^{1+\epsilon}} \\
{\nu \defeq n/2 \longrightarrow} 	& \la \sum_{r=1}^{\nu-1} \left( \frac{\nu + r}{1+r} \right)^{1-\epsilon} \frac{1}{(\nu -r )^{1+\epsilon}} \\
\nu - r \eqdef s \longrightarrow	 &  \la \sum_{s=1}^{\nu-1} \left( \frac{2\nu - s}{1+ \nu - s} \right)^{1-\epsilon} \frac{1}{s^{1+\epsilon}} \\
	& \leq \sum_{s=1}^{\nu-1} \left( \frac{2\nu - s}{1+ \nu - s} \right) \frac{1}{s^{1+\epsilon}} \\
	& = \sum_{s=1}^{\nu} \left(1 + \frac{\nu}{1+\nu-s} \right) \frac{1}{s^{1+\epsilon}}.
	\end{align*}
	Hence, as $\zeta(1+\epsilon) < \infty$ for $\epsilon > 0$, it remains to treat the term
	\begin{align*}
		\sum_{s=1}^\nu \frac{\nu}{1+\nu -s} \frac{1}{s^{1+\epsilon}} & = \frac{\nu}{1+\nu} \sum_{s=1}^\nu \left( \frac{1}{s^{1+\epsilon}} + \frac{1}{1+\nu-s} \frac{1}{s^\epsilon} \right),
	\end{align*}
	which will be finite if we can bound the second term therein. Apply H\"older's inequality:
	\[ \sum_{s=1}^\nu \frac{1}{1+\nu-s} \frac{1}{s^\epsilon} \leq \left( \sum_{s=1}^\nu \frac{1}{(1+\nu-s)^p} \right)^{1/p} \left( \sum_{s=1}^\nu \frac{1}{s^{\epsilon q}} \right)^{1/q}  \]
	for $p^{-1} + q^{-1} = 1$, where for convergence as $\nu \to \infty$ we require that $p > 1$ and $\epsilon q > 1$ simultaneously. This is possible precisely because $\epsilon > 0$: pick, say, $q = \epsilon^{-1} (1+\tilde{\epsilon}) > \epsilon^{-1}$ for some $\tilde{\epsilon} > 0$, which then gives $ p = q(q-1)^{-1} = (1+\tilde{\epsilon})(1+\tilde{\epsilon} - \epsilon)^{-1} > 1$.
\end{proof}

We return now to estimate \eqref{Q0++estimate} and note that the function $\lambda(m) = (1+ (m+1)^2 - n^2)^2 (m+1)^{-1+2\epsilon}$ is decreasing in $m$ in the range $|n-2l| \leq m \leq n-2$ (cf. \Cref{lem:behaviour_lambda}), so its maximum in this range is attained at $m=|n-2l|$. Using \Cref{lemma:discrete_convolution_bound_CG_orthogonality} and \Cref{lem:converging_sum_factor_Q0++}, we have
\begin{align}
	\label{Q0++estimate}
	\begin{split}
	\| Q_0^{+,+} \|^2_{L^2(\mathbb{S}^1;H^\epsilon( \mathbb{S}^3))} & \la_\epsilon \sum_{n \geq 2} \sum_{m \geq 0} \sum_{l=1}^{n-1} (1+(m+1)^2 - n^2)^2 (m+1)^{-1+2\epsilon} \frac{(1+|n-2l|)^{1-2\epsilon} l^{1+2\epsilon}}{(n-l)^{1-2\epsilon}} \\
	& \times \vertiii{(m+1) \varpi^{+,+}_l(\pi_m)_n}^2 \\
	&\la_\epsilon \sum_{n \geq 2} \sum_{l=1}^{n-1} \frac{(1+(|n-2l|+1)^2 - n^2)^2}{(n-l)^{1-2\epsilon}} l^{1+2\epsilon} \vertiii{\hat{f}(\pi_{l-1})}^2 \vertiii{\hat{g}(\pi_{n-l-1})}^2 \\
n-l \eqdef k \longrightarrow & \la_\epsilon \sum_{l \geq 1} \sum_{k \geq 1} \frac{(1+(|k-l|+1)^2 - (k+l)^2)^2}{k^{1-2\epsilon}} l^{1+2\epsilon} \vertiii{\hat{f}(\pi_{l-1})}^2 \vertiii{\hat{g}(\pi_{k-1})}^2 \\
	& \la_\epsilon \sum_{l \geq 1} \sum_{k \geq 1} \frac{k^2 l^2 }{k^{1-2\epsilon}} l^{1+2\epsilon} \vertiii{\hat{f}(\pi_{l-1})}^2 \vertiii{\hat{g}(\pi_{k-1})}^2 \\
	& \la_\epsilon \| f \|^2_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \| g \|^2_{H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3)}.
	\end{split}
\end{align}



\subsection{Estimate for $Q_0^{+,-}$}

Here we must split the estimate into the two cases $n \geq 0$ and $n < 0$. We have
\begin{align*}
	\| Q_0^{+,-} \|^2_{L^2(\mathbb{S}^1;H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3))} & \simeq \sum_{n \in \mathbb{Z}} \sum_{m \geq 0} (m+1)^{1+2\epsilon} \vertiii{\mathcal{F}(Q_0^{+,-})(\pi_m)_n}^2 \\
	& \simeq \bigg[\sum_{n \geq 0 } + \sum_{n < 0} \bigg] \underbrace{\sum_{m \geq 0} (1+(m+1)^2 - n^2)^2 (m+1)^{1+2\epsilon} \vertiii{\sum_{\substack{l \geq n+1 \\ l \geq 1}} \varpi^{+,-}_l(\pi_m)_n }^2}_{(\star)} .\\
\end{align*}

\subsubsection*{Case $n<0$.}
In the case $n < 0$, we have, for any fixed $\theta > 1$,
\begin{align*}
	\sum_{n < 0} (\star) & = \sum_{n<0} \sum_{m \geq 0} (1+(m+1)^2-n^2)(m+1)^{-1+2\epsilon} \vertiii{\sum_{l \geq 1} (m+1)\varpi^{+,-}_l(\pi_m)_n }^2 \\
	& \la \sum_{n < 0} \sum_{m \geq 0} (1+ (m+1)^2 - n^2)^2 (m+1)^{-1+2\epsilon} \sum_{l \geq 1} l^\theta \vertiii{(m+1)\varpi^{+,-}_l(\pi_m)_n}^2 \sum_{k \geq 1} k^{-\theta}.
\end{align*}
Now in the range $|n| \leq m \leq |n| + 2(l-1)$ the function $\lambda(m;n) = (1+(m+1)^2 -n^2)^2 (m+1)^{-1+2\epsilon}$ is increasing, so is maximised at $m = |n| + 2(l-1)$. Hence, using \Cref{lemma:discrete_convolution_bound_CG_orthogonality},
\begin{align*}
	\sum_{n < 0} (\star) & \la \sum_{n < 0 } \sum_{l \geq 1} \frac{(1+(|n|+2l -1)^2 -n^2)^2}{(|n| + 2l -1)^{1-2\epsilon}} l^\theta \sum_m \vertiii{(m+1)\varpi^{+,-}_l(\pi_m)_n}^2 \underbrace{\sum_{k \geq 1} k^{-\theta}}_{= \zeta(\theta) < \infty } \\
	& \la_\theta \sum_{n < 0} \sum_{l \geq 1} \frac{l^2(l+|n|)^2}{(l + |n|)^{1-2\epsilon}} l^{\theta} \vertiii{\hat{g}(\pi_{l-n-1})}^2 \vertiii{\hat{f}(\pi_{l-1})}^2 \\
	& \la_\theta \sum_{n < 0} \sum_{l \geq 1} l^{2+\theta} \vertiii{\hat{f}(\pi_{l-1})}^2 (l+|n|)^{1+2\epsilon} \vertiii{\hat{g}(\pi_{l-n-1})}^2 \\
	& \la_\epsilon  \| f \|^2_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \| g \|^2_{H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3)} \, ,
\end{align*}
where $\theta = 1 + 2\epsilon > 1$.


\subsubsection*{Case $n \geq 0$.} Here we proceed similarly; for any fixed $\theta >1$ we have
\begin{align*}
		\sum_{n \geq 0} (\star) & = \sum_{n \geq 0} \sum_{m \geq 0} (1+(m+1)^2-n^2)(m+1)^{-1+2\epsilon} \vertiii{\sum_{l \geq n + 1} (m+1)\varpi^{+,-}_l(\pi_m)_n }^2 \\
	& \la \sum_{n \geq 0} \sum_{m \geq 0} (1+ (m+1)^2 - n^2)^2 (m+1)^{-1+2\epsilon} \sum_{l \geq n + 1} l^\theta \vertiii{(m+1)\varpi^{+,-}_l(\pi_m)_n}^2 \sum_{k \geq n+1} k^{-\theta},
\end{align*}
where now the range of $m$ is $n \leq m \leq -n+2(l-1)$, so that $\lambda(m)$ is increasing and so maximised at $m = -n+2(l-1)$. Hence, using \Cref{lemma:discrete_convolution_bound_CG_orthogonality} again,
\begin{align*}
		\sum_{n \geq 0} (\star) & \la \sum_{n \geq 0} \sum_{m \geq 0} (1+ (m+1)^2 - n^2)^2 (m+1)^{-1+2\epsilon} \sum_{l \geq n + 1} l^\theta \vertiii{(m+1)\varpi^{+,-}_l(\pi_m)_n}^2 \underbrace{\sum_{k \geq n+1} k^{-\theta}}_{\leq \zeta(\theta) < \infty} \\
		& \la_\theta \sum_{n \geq 0} \frac{(1+(2l -n -1))^2 - n^2)^2}{(2l-n-1)^{1-2\epsilon}} \sum_{ l \geq n +1} l^\theta \vertiii{\hat{g}(\pi_{l-n-1})}^2 \vertiii{\hat{f}(\pi_{l-1})}^2 \\
		& \la_\theta \sum_{n \geq 0} \sum_{l \geq n+1} \frac{l^2(l-n)^2}{(l-n)^{1-2\epsilon}} l^\theta \vertiii{\hat{g}(\pi_{l-n-1})}^2 \vertiii{\hat{f}(\pi_{l-1})}^2 \\
		& \la_\epsilon \|f \|^2_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \| g \|^2_{H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3)},
\end{align*}
where as before $ \theta = 1 + 2\epsilon$. We have therefore shown that for any fixed $\epsilon > 0$
\[ \|Q_0^{+,-}\|^2_{L^2(\mathbb{S}^1; H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3))} \la_\epsilon \| f \|^2_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \| g \|^2_{H^\epsilon(\mathbb{S}^3)}.  \]
Putting this together with estimate \eqref{Q0++estimate}, we conclude the proof of \Cref{thm:basic_estimate}. \hfill \qed



\begin{remark}
	It is the application of H\"older's inequality to split the sum over $l$ (i.e. over the Clebsch--Gordan expansion) in the above estimates that is fundamentally responsible for the loss of $\epsilon$ amount of differentiability; it is only here that the estimate is non-uniform in $\epsilon$. Note that our constant $C(\epsilon)$ in \Cref{thm:master_theorem} therefore diverges like $\zeta(1)$, i.e. logarithmically, as $\epsilon \to 0$.
\end{remark}



\section{Conformal estimate on $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$} \label{sec:conformal_estimate}

We now turn to the conformal estimate corresponding to \Cref{thm:master_theorem}. Here we use the conformal invariance of the wave equation; if $\phi$ satisfies 
\[ \Box_{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3} \phi + \phi = F \]
on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$ with data $(f_0, f_1)$, then $\tilde{\phi} = \Omega \phi$ satisfies
\[ \Box_{\mathbb{R}^{1+3}} \tilde{\phi} = \Omega^3 F \eqdef \tilde{F} \]
on $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$ with data $(\tilde{f}_0, \tilde{f}_1)=(wf_0, w^2 f_1)$, where $w= 2(1+ \tilde{r}^2)^{-1} = \Omega|_{\tilde{t}=0}$, and $\Omega$ is the conformal factor
\begin{align}
\label{conformal_factor}
\begin{split}
 \Omega &= 2  \left( 1 + (\tilde{t} - \tilde{r})^2 \right)^{-1/2} \left( 1 + (\tilde{t} + \tilde{r})^2 \right)^{-1/2} \\
& = 2 \cos \left( \frac{t-z}{2} \right) \cos \left( \frac{t+z}{2} \right),
\end{split}
\end{align}
where $\tilde{t}$, $\tilde{r}$ are the usual coordinates on $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$ and $z = \arctan(\tilde{t} + \tilde{r}) - \arctan(\tilde{t} - \tilde{r})$ is one of the angles on $\mathbb{S}^3$, the metric $g_{\mathbb{S}^3}$ being given by $\d z^2 - (\sin^2 z) g_{\mathbb{S}^2}$. Note that $\Omega$ is a smooth function on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$, and we have
\[ Q_0(\Omega, \Omega) = 2 \Omega \sin \left( \frac{t-z}{2} \right) \sin \left( \frac{t+z}{2} \right). \]
Writing $\widetilde{Q}_0(\tilde{\phi},\tilde{\psi})$ to denote the null form on $(\mathbb{R}^{1+3}, \eta_{ab})$,
\[ \widetilde{Q}_0(\tilde{\phi},\tilde{\psi}) = \tilde{\nabla}_a \tilde{\phi} \tilde{\nabla}^a \tilde{\psi}, \]
a calculation shows 
\begin{equation}
\label{conformal_null_form}
	\widetilde{Q}_0(\tilde{\phi}, \tilde{\psi}) = \Omega^4 Q_0(\phi, \psi) + \Omega^3 \phi Q_0(\Omega, \psi) + \Omega^3 \psi Q_0(\Omega, \phi) + \Omega^2 \phi \psi Q_0(\Omega, \Omega),
\end{equation}
or, taking into account the above expression for $Q_0(\Omega, \Omega)$,
\begin{equation}
\label{conformal_null_form_2}
 \widetilde{Q}_0(\tilde{\phi}, \tilde{\psi}) = \Omega^4 Q_0(\phi, \psi) + \Omega^3 \left( \mathfrak{a}^\mu \phi \nabla_\mu \psi + \mathfrak{b}^\mu \psi \nabla_\mu \phi + \mathfrak{c} \phi \psi \right)
\end{equation}
for a smooth function $\mathfrak{c}$ and smooth vector fields $\mathfrak{a}^\mu$, $\mathfrak{b}^\mu$ on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$. Note that the standard foliation of $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$ which was used for our estimates in the previous sections corresponds to a \emph{hyperboloidal} foliation on $\mathbb{R}^{1+3}$, given by the level sets $\Sigma_t \simeq \mathbb{R}^3$ of the function
\[ t = \arctan(\tilde{t} + \tilde{r}) + \arctan(\tilde{t} - \tilde{r}) \in (-\pi, \pi), \]
with unit normal (with respect to $\eta_{ab} = \d \tilde{t}^2 - \d \tilde{r}^2 - \tilde{r}^2 g_{\mathbb{S}^2}$)
\[ T^a \partial_a = \left( 1+ 2(\tilde{t}^2 + \tilde{r}^2) + (\tilde{t}^2 - \tilde{r}^2)^2 \right)^{-1} \left( 2 (1+\tilde{t}^2 + \tilde{r}^2) \frac{\partial}{\partial \tilde{t}} + 4 \tilde{t} \tilde{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial \tilde{r}} \right). \]
\Cref{thm:master_theorem} will therefore imply an estimate for $\widetilde{Q}_0(\tilde{\phi}, \tilde{\psi})$ with respect to this foliation. The metric on $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3$ is related to the Minkowski metric $\eta_{ab}$ by
\[ g^{\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{S}^3}_{ab} = \d t^2 - g_{\mathbb{S}^3} = \Omega^2 \eta_{ab}, \]
so writing $\Omega^{-2} g_{\mathbb{S}^3} \eqdef g_{\Sigma_t}$, we have $\dvol_{\Sigma_t} = \Omega^{-3} \dvol_{\mathbb{S}^3}$, and
\[ \eta_{ab} = \Omega^{-2} \d t^2 - g_{\Sigma_t}, \]
where the volume form of $g^{\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{S}^3}$ is related to the volume form of $\eta$ by $\dvol_\eta = \Omega^{-4} \d t \wedge \dvol_{\mathbb{S}^3} = \Omega^{-1} \d t \wedge \dvol_{\Sigma_t}$. 

For simplicity, consider the case when the data $(\tilde{f}_0, \tilde{f}_1)$ and $(\tilde{g}_0, \tilde{g}_1)$, and $\tilde{F}$, $\tilde{G}$ all have compact support; by finite speed of propagation, the solutions $\tilde{\phi}$, $\tilde{\psi}$ to
\[ \Box_{\mathbb{R}^{1+3}} \tilde{\phi} = \tilde{F} \qquad \text{and} \qquad \Box_{\mathbb{R}^{1+3}} \tilde{\psi} = \tilde{G} \]
are then compactly supported in space, in the sense that e.g. $\tilde{\phi}|_{\Sigma_t}$ has compact support for each $t$. Then for any $t \in (-\pi, \pi)$, using the smoothness of $\Omega$, $\mathfrak{a}$, $\mathfrak{b}$, $\mathfrak{c}$ and the compact support of $\phi$, $\psi$, \eqref{conformal_null_form_2} implies
\[ \| \widetilde{Q}_0(\tilde{\phi}, \tilde{\psi}) \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\Sigma_t)} \la \| Q_0(\phi, \psi)(t,\cdot) \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \| \phi(t,\cdot) \|_{H^{2+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \| \psi(t,\cdot) \|_{H^{2+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)}. \]
Squaring and integrating in $t$, we have for any $0 < T < \pi$
\begin{align*}
	\int_0^T \| \widetilde{Q}_0(\tilde{\phi}, \tilde{\psi}) \|^2_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\Sigma_t)} \, \d t & \la \| Q_0(\phi, \psi) \|^2_{L^2([-\pi,\pi];H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3))} \\
	& \hspace{35pt} + \sup_{t \in [-\pi,\pi]}  \| \phi(t,\cdot) \|^2_{H^{2+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \| \psi(t,\cdot) \|^2_{H^{2+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \\
	& \la \left( \| f_0 \|_{H^{2+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \| f_1 \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \| F(t,\cdot) \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \, \d t \right)^2 \\
	& \hspace{1pt} \times \left( \| g_0 \|_{H^{2+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \| g_1 \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \| G(t,\cdot) \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\mathbb{S}^3)} \, \d t \right)^2 \\
	& \la \left( \| \tilde{f}_0 \|_{H^{2+\epsilon}(\Sigma_0)} + \| \tilde{f}_1 \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\Sigma_0)} + \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \| \tilde{F}(t,\cdot) \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\Sigma_t)} \, \d t \right)^2 \\
	& \hspace{1pt} \times \left( \| \tilde{g}_0 \|_{H^{2+\epsilon}(\Sigma_0)} + \| \tilde{g}_1 \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\Sigma_0)} + \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} \| \tilde{G}(t,\cdot) \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\Sigma_t)} \, \d t \right)^2,
\end{align*}
where in the second line we used \Cref{thm:master_theorem} and the energy inequality, and in the third line the fact that the functions involved all have compact support. To obtain a perhaps more natural statement with the time variable ranging over $\mathbb{R}$, we can now decompactify the time function $t$ using
\[ \check{t} = \tan \frac{t}{2}, \]
which gives $\d \check{t} = \frac{1}{2} \sec^2 \frac{t}{2} \, \d t$, to obtain for any $ 0 < \check{T} < \infty$ the hyperboloidal estimate
\begin{align*}
	\int_0^{\check{T}} \| \widetilde{Q}_0(\tilde{\phi}, \tilde{\psi}) \|^2_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\Sigma_{\check{t}})} \, \d \check{t} & \la \left( \| \tilde{f}_0 \|_{H^{2+\epsilon}(\Sigma_0)} + \| \tilde{f}_1 \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\Sigma_0)} + \| \tilde{F}\|_{L^1(\mathbb{R}_{\check{t}};H^{1+\epsilon}(\Sigma_{\check{t}}))} \right)^2 \\
	& \hspace{1pt} \times \left( \| \tilde{g}_0 \|_{H^{2+\epsilon}(\Sigma_0)} + \| \tilde{g}_1 \|_{H^{1+\epsilon}(\Sigma_0)} + \| \tilde{G}\|_{L^1(\mathbb{R}_{\check{t}};H^{1+\epsilon}(\Sigma_{\check{t}}))} \right)^2,
\end{align*}
where the constant depends on $\check{T}$, $\epsilon$, and the supports of $\tilde{f}_i$, $\tilde{g}_i$, $\tilde{F}$, $\tilde{G}$.




\begin{remark}
The above estimate is somewhat crude; it is possible to precisely quantify the decay imposed on $\tilde{f}_0$, $\tilde{f}_1$, $\tilde{F}$, $\tilde{g}_0$, $\tilde{g}_1$, $\tilde{G}$ using weighted Sobolev spaces \cite{Miller1982}, and hence remove the dependence in the above on the supports of $\tilde{f}_i$, $\tilde{g}_i$, $\tilde{F}$, $\tilde{G}$, and $\check{T}$. These conformally weighted function spaces been studied extensively in the literature \cite{Christodoulou1986,GeorgievSchirmer1995}, so we do not include a discussion of them here.

%\section{Proof of \Cref{lemma:spacetime_convolution_lemma}} \label{appendix:convolution_lemma}
%
%We abbreviate $\mathcal{F}_{t \to \tau, \, x \to \xi}$ by $\mathcal{F}$. By \eqref{FT_of_initial_data}, $\mathcal{F}(\tilde{\phi}^+)$ is supported on the future lightcone of the origin, so the fact that $\mathcal{F}((\tilde{\phi}^+)^2)$ is supported in the interior $\tau \geq |\xi|$ of the future lightcone follows from standard properties of the convolution operation. Then for $\tau > |\xi|$ we calculate
%\begin{align*}
%\mathcal{F}((\tilde{\phi}^+)^2)(\tau, \xi) &= \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \int_{\mathbb{R}} \mathcal{F}(\tilde{\phi}^+)(\tau', \xi')\mathcal{F}(\tilde{\phi}^+)(\tau- \tau', \xi-\xi') \, \d \tau' \d \xi'	\\
%& =\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \int_{\mathbb{R}} 8 \pi^2 \frac{\hat{\tilde{f}}(\xi')}{|\xi'|} \delta(\tau' - |\xi'|) \hat{\tilde{f}}(\xi - \xi') \chi_{[0, \infty)}(\tau - \tau') \delta((\tau - \tau')^2 - |\xi - \xi'|^2) \, \d \tau' \d \xi' \\
%& = \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \int_0^\tau 8 \pi^2 \frac{\hat{\tilde{f}}(\xi')}{|\xi'|} \hat{\tilde{f}}(\xi - \xi') \delta(\tau - |\xi'|) \delta((\tau - \tau')^2 - |\xi - \xi'|^2) \, \d \tau' \d \xi'.
%\end{align*}
%Noticing that for $\tau' = |\xi'|$ and $\omega \defeq \frac{\xi'}{|\xi'|}$
%\[ (\tau - \tau')^2 - |\xi - \xi'|^2 = \tau^2 - |\xi|^2 - 2\tau |\xi'| + 2 \xi \cdot \xi' = (\tau^2 - |\xi|^2)(1-2\alpha^{-1}|\xi'|), \]
%we have
%\[ \mathcal{F}((\tilde{\phi}^+)^2) = 8 \pi^2 \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \frac{\hat{\tilde{f}}(\xi')}{|\xi'|} \hat{\tilde{f}}(\xi-\xi') \delta(\tau^2 - |\xi|^2)(1-2\alpha^{-1}|\xi'|) \, \d \xi'. \]
%Changing to spherical polars $\xi' = \rho \omega$, this becomes
%\[ \mathcal{F}((\tilde{\phi}^+)^2) = 8 \pi^2 \int_0^\infty \rho^2 \d \rho \int_{\mathbb{S}^2} \d^2 \omega \frac{\hat{\tilde{f}}(\rho \omega)}{\rho} \hat{\tilde{f}}(\xi - \rho \omega) \delta((\tau^2 - |\xi|^2)(1-2\alpha^{-1}\rho)), \]
%and making the change of variables $\sigma = (\tau^2 - |\xi|^2)2\alpha^{-1} \rho$ one has
%\begin{align*}
%	\mathcal{F}((\tilde{\phi}^+)^2) & = 8 \pi^2 \int_0^\infty \d \sigma \int_{\mathbb{S}^2} \d^2 \omega \left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)^2 \frac{\sigma}{(\tau^2 - |\xi|^2)^2} \hat{\tilde{f}}(\rho \omega) \hat{\tilde{f}}(\xi - \rho \omega) \delta(\tau^2 - |\xi|^2 - \sigma) \\
%	&= \frac{2\pi^2}{\tau^2 - |\xi|^2} \int_{\mathbb{S}^2} \d^2 \omega \, \alpha^2 \hat{\tilde{f}}\left( \frac{\alpha}{2} \omega \right) \hat{\tilde{f}} \left( \xi - \frac{\alpha}{2} \omega \right).
%\end{align*}


\section{Harmonic analysis on Lie groups} \label{sec:harmonicanalygroups}

\subsection{Peter--Weyl Theorem}

Here we recap briefly the fundamentals of harmonic analysis on Lie groups. The proofs of the statements below can be found in standard texts, e.g. \cite{Faraut2008}. Let $\mathrm{G}$ be a compact matrix Lie group. A \emph{representation} of $\mathrm{G}$ on a finite dimensional complex vector space $V$ is a group homomorphism $\pi : \mathrm{G} \to \mathrm{GL}(V)$ such that the map $g \mapsto \pi(g) v$ is continuous for all $v \in V$. We say two representations $(\pi_1, V_1)$ and $(\pi_2, V_2)$ are \emph{equivalent} if there exists a continuous isomorphism $A :V_1 \to V_2$ such that $A \pi_1(g) = \pi_2(g) A$ for all $g \in \mathrm{G}$. In this case we write $\pi_1 \simeq \pi_2$. Let $(\pi, V)$ be a representation of $\mathrm{G}$ and let $W \subset V$ be a subspace of $V$. The space $W$ is said to be an \emph{invariant subspace} of the representation $\pi$ if $\pi(\mathrm{G}) W \subset W$. One then defines an \emph{irreducible} representation to be a representation which has no non-trivial invariant subspaces.

Next suppose $V$ is a complex vector space equipped with a Hermitian inner product $\langle \cdot, \cdot \rangle$. Recall that an operator $A$ on $V$ is \emph{unitary} if $\langle A u , Aw \rangle = \langle v, w \rangle$ for all $v,w \in V$. We say that a representation $\pi$ of $\mathrm{G}$ on $V$ is \emph{unitary} if for every $g \in \mathrm{G}$ the operator $\pi(g)$ is unitary.

Every compact Lie group $\mathrm{G}$ admits a unique (up to multiplication by a positive constant) left-invariant measure $\mu$ called the \emph{Haar measure}. That is, the measure $\mu$ satisfies
\[ \int_{\mathrm{G}} f(kx) \, \d \mu(x) = \int_{\mathrm{G}} f(x) \, \d \mu(x) \]
for every measurable function $f : \mathrm{G} \to \mathbb{C}$ and all $k \in \mathrm{G}$. We fix the Haar measure by the normalization
\[ \int_{\mathrm{G}} \d \mu(x) = 1. \]
The Haar measure on any compact connected Lie group $\mathrm{G}$ is also right-invariant.

\begin{definition} Let $\hat{\mathrm{G}}$ denote the set of equivalence classes of unitary irreducible representations of a compact Lie group $\mathrm{G}$. The set $\hat{\mathrm{G}}$ is called the \emph{unitary dual} of $\mathrm{G}$.	
\end{definition}

\begin{definition} Let $\pi : \mathrm{G} \to \mathrm{GL}(V)$ be a unitary $\mathbb{C}$-linear irreducible representation of $\mathrm{G}$ on a complex vector space $V$ of dimension $d_\pi$. Let $\{ e_i \}_{1 \leq i \leq d_\pi}$ be an orthonormal basis for $V$. We call
\[ \pi_{ij}(g) \defeq \langle \pi(g) e_j, e_i \rangle \]
the \emph{matrix coefficients} of $\pi$ with respect to $\{ e_i \}_i$.	
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}[Schur orthogonality] For $u,v,u',v' \in V$ one has the orthogonality relations
\[ \int_{\mathrm{G}} \langle \pi(g) u, v \rangle \overline{\langle \pi(g) u', v' \rangle} \, \d \mu(g) = \frac{1}{d_\pi} \langle u, u' \rangle \overline{\langle v, v' \rangle}. \]
\end{proposition}

As a consequence of Schur orthogonality, it is easy to check that the matrix coefficients of a unitary $\mathbb{C}$-linear irreducible representation $\pi$ are orthogonal in $L^2(\mathrm{G})$,
\begin{equation} \label{matrixcoefficientorthogonality} \langle \pi_{ij}, \pi_{kl} \rangle_{L^2(\mathrm{G})} \defeq \int_{\mathrm{G}} \pi_{ij}(g) \overline{\pi_{kl}(g)} \, \d \mu(g) = \frac{1}{d_\pi} \delta_{ik} \delta_{jl}. \end{equation}
Let $\mathcal{M}_\pi$ denote the subspace of $L^2(\mathrm{G})$ spanned by the matrix coefficients $\pi_{ij}$ for $1 \leq i,j \leq d_\pi$. It is not hard to see that $\mathcal{M}_\pi$ is independent of the choice of orthonormal basis for $V$, and that, on account of \eqref{matrixcoefficientorthogonality},
\[ \left\{ \sqrt{d_\pi} \pi_{ij} \, : \, 1 \leq i, j \leq d_\pi \right\} \]
is an orthonormal basis for $\mathcal{M}_\pi \subset L^2(\mathrm{G})$.

\begin{proposition} If $\pi \not\simeq \pi'$ are two inequivalent unitary irreducible representations of $\mathrm{G}$, then $\mathcal{M}_\pi$ and $\mathcal{M}_{\pi'}$ are orthogonal in $L^2(\mathrm{G})$,
\[ \int_{\mathrm{G}} \langle \pi(g) u, v \rangle \overline{\langle \pi'(g) u', v' \rangle'} \, \d \mu(g) = 0 \]
for all $u,v \in V$, $u', v' \in V'$.	
\end{proposition}

\begin{theorem}[Peter--Weyl]
\[ L^2(\mathrm{G}) = \widehat{\bigoplus}_{\pi \in \hat{\mathrm{G}}} \mathcal{M}_\pi, \]
where $\widehat{\bigoplus}_\pi \mathcal{M}_\pi$ denotes the closure of $\bigoplus_\pi \mathcal{M}_\pi$ in $L^2(\mathrm{G})$.	
\end{theorem}

\begin{definition} Let $f \in L^1(\mathrm{G})$. For each $\pi \in \hat{\mathrm{G}}$ the \emph{Fourier coefficient} $\hat{f}(\pi)$ is the operator on $V$ (the complex vector space associated with the representation $\pi$)  defined by 
\[ \hat{f}(\pi) \defeq \int_{\mathrm{G}} f(g) \pi(g^{-1}) \, \d \mu(g). \]
For matrix Lie groups $\hat{f}(\pi)$ can be thought of as a matrix.
\end{definition}

By the Schur orthogonality relations and the Peter--Weyl theorem,
\[ \mathcal{B} = \left\{ \sqrt{d_\pi} \pi_{ij}, \, \pi \in \hat{\mathrm{G}}, \, 1 \leq i, j \leq d_\pi \right\} \]
is a Hilbert basis for $L^2(\mathrm{G})$. It is not difficult to check that for $f \in L^2(\mathrm{G})$ we have
\[ \langle f, \pi_{ij} \rangle_{L^2(\mathrm{G})} = \langle \hat{f}(\pi) e_j, e_i \rangle_V = \hat{f}(\pi)_{ij}. \]
This leads to the following.

\begin{theorem}[Plancherel Theorem] Let $f \in L^2(\mathrm{G})$. Then
\[ f(g) = \sum_{\pi \in \hat{\mathrm{G}}} d_\pi \operatorname{Tr}(\hat{f}(g) \pi(g) ) \]
in $L^2(\mathrm{G})$, and furthermore
\[ \| f \|^2_{L^2(\mathrm{G})} = \sum_{\pi \in \hat{\mathrm{G}}} d_\pi \vertiii{ \hat{f}(\pi) }^2, \]
where $\vertiii{\hat{f}(\pi)}$ is the Frobenius norm of the matrix $\hat{f}(\pi)$ defined by $\vertiii{A}^2 = \operatorname{Tr}(A A^\dagger)$.	
\end{theorem}



\subsection{Sobolev spaces on \texorpdfstring{$\mathrm{SU}(2)$}{SU2}}

We identify $\mathbb{S}^3 \simeq \mathrm{SU}(2)$. The normalized Haar measure on $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ is the volume form of the standard metric on $\mathbb{S}^3$,
\begin{equation} \label{Haarmeasure} \d \mu = \frac{1}{2 \pi^2} \dvol_{\mathbb{S}^3}. \end{equation}
For convenience we will define the Sobolev norms on $\mathbb{S}^3$ with respect to the scaling \eqref{Haarmeasure} of the $\mathbb{S}^3$ volume form. The finite-dimensional irreducible representations $\pi_m : \mathrm{SU}(2) \to \mathrm{GL}(V_m)$ of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ are labelled by $m \in \mathbb{N}_0$, one for each $m$, and have dimensions $(m+1)$. They are exactly the eigenfunctions of the metric Laplacian $\slashed{\Delta}$ on $\mathbb{S}^3$ (or equivalently the Casimir operator on $\mathrm{SU}(2)$),
\[ \slashed{\Delta} \pi_m = - m(m+2) \pi_m. \]
Since $\pi_m$ is a matrix of size $(m+1) \times (m+1)$, the eigenvalue $-m(m+2)$ has multiplicity $(m+1)^2$. The Schur orthogonality relations imply that
\[ \int_{\mathrm{SU}(2)} (\pi_m)_{ij}(x) \overline{(\pi_n)_{i'j'}(x)} \, \d \mu(x) = \frac{1}{(m+1)} \delta_{i i'} \delta_{j j'} \delta_{mn}, \]
and the Peter--Weyl and Plancherel theorems state that any $f \in L^2(\mathbb{S}^3)$ is expressible as its Fourier series
\[ f(x) = \sum_{m \geq 0} (m+1) \operatorname{Tr}(\hat{f}(\pi_m) \pi_m(x)), \]
interpreted as equality in $L^2(\mathbb{S}^3)$. Furthermore, the $L^2$ norm of $f$ is given by
\[ \| f \|^2_{L^2(\mathbb{S}^3)} = \sum_{m \geq 0} (m+1) \, \vertiii{ \hat{f}(\pi_m) }^2.  \]
One can similarly define the Sobolev spaces $H^k(\mathbb{S}^3)$ using the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Fourier coefficients. By Schur orthogonality,
\begin{align*} \| \slashgrad f \|^2_{L^2(\mathbb{S}^3)} & = \langle f, - \slashed{\Delta} f \rangle_{L^2(\mathbb{S}^3)} \\
& = \sum_{m \geq 0} \sum_{n \geq 0} (n+1)(m+1) \hat{f}(\pi_n)_{ij} \hat{f}(\pi_m)_{rs} \langle (\pi_n)_{ji}, -\slashed{\Delta} (\pi_m)_{sr} \rangle_{L^2(\mathbb{S}^3)}	 \\
& = \sum_{m \geq 0} \sum_{n \geq 0} (n+1) m(m+1)(m+2) \hat{f}(\pi_n)_{ij} \hat{f}(\pi_m)_{rs} \delta_{mn} \frac{1}{(m+1)} \delta_{js} \delta_{ir} \\
& = \sum_{m \geq 0} m(m+1)(m+2) \, \vertiii{ \hat{f}(\pi_m) }^2,
\end{align*}
so
\begin{align*} \| f \|^2_{H^1(\mathbb{S}^3)} &= \| f \|^2_{L^2(\mathbb{S}^3)} + \| \slashgrad f \|^2_{L^2(\mathbb{S}^3)} = \sum_{m \geq 0} (m+1)^3 \, \vertiii{ \hat{f}(\pi_m) }^2.
\end{align*}
It is not difficult to see that the usual higher differentiability Sobolev norms are equivalent to similar expressions,
\[ \| f \|^2_{H^k(\mathbb{S}^3)} \simeq \sum_{m \geq 0} (m+1)^{2k+1} \, \vertiii{ \hat{f}(\pi_m) }^2. \]
We also use the above expression to define the spaces $H^k(\mathbb{S}^3)$ for non-integer $k$. This definition coincides with the usual one, $ H^k(\mathbb{S}^3) = (1-\slashed{\Delta})^{-k/2}(L^2(\mathbb{S}^3))$.
