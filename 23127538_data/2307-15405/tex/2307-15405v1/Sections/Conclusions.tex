\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
In this letter, we presented the first calculation of a planar three-loop four-point amplitude in QCD with an external mass. This calculation opens the door to a wealth of three-loop amplitudes, indispensable to precision phenomenology at hadron colliders: $V$+jet production at the LHC or three-jet production at lepton colliders, as well as the production of a Higgs boson with a jet. As the present calculation stretches current methods to their computational limit, these tasks will require a concerted effort on the completion of the non-planar integrals, the study of the special functions which appear within, as well as new ideas for IBP reduction and improvements in computer algebra for handling large intermediate expressions. In turn, the availability of three-loop amplitudes will enable precision phenomenology at N$^3$LO in QCD, which is necessary to reach the percent-level goal ahead of the High-Luminosity run at the LHC.
