  "abstract": "We theoretically describe macroscopic quantum synchronization effects occurring in a network of all-to-all coupled quantum limit-cycle oscillators. The coupling causes a transition to synchronization as indicated by the presence of global phase coherence. We demonstrate that the microscopic quantum properties of the oscillators qualitatively shape the synchronization behavior in a macroscopically large network. Specifically, they result in a blockade of collective synchronization that is not expected for classical oscillators. Additionally, the macroscopic ensemble shows emergent behavior not present at the level of two coupled quantum oscillators.",
