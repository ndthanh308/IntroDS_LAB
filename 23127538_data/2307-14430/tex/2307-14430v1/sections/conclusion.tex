\section{Conclusion}

Given a fixed budget of data, knowing what data to train on to induce various capabilities in an LM is challenging. As LMs continue to improve, it will become increasingly important to extract as much signal as possible from the data and to direct that signal towards acquiring a broad variety of capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a skills-based framework for understanding how LMs learn and for selecting training data. We hope our study invites others to build on such a notion of skill and further explore how to align skills with data.
