  "abstract": "We study the contrast for electrical and optical readout of NV centers in diamond in dependence of the optical excitation wavelength using different excitation schemes. While the optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) works efficiently between 480 and 580 nm, electrically detected magnetic resonance (EDMR) shows a strong dependence on the excitation dynamics. The highest, electrically detected contrast of -23% is achieved by resonantly exciting the zero-phonon line of the neutral charge state of NV at 575 nm. EDMR is also enhanced at 521 nm, possibly due to a further excited state of NV$^-$.",
