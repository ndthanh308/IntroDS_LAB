  "abstract": "We prove two results that together strongly suggest that obtaining a positive answer to the Navier-Stokes global regularity question requires more than a refinement of partial regularity theory. First we prove that there exists a class of bilinear operators $\\mathfrak{B}$, which contains the Euler bilinear operator $\\mathcal{E}(u,v):=\\frac{1}{2}\\mathbb{P}(u\\cdot\\nabla v + v\\cdot\\nabla u)$, such that for any $B\\in \\mathfrak{B}$, $n\\geq3$, $α\\in ((n+1)/4, (n+2)/4)$, and smooth solution $u$ of the pseudodifferential equation $\\partial_t u +(-Δ)^αu +B(u,u)=0$ on $\\mathbb{R}^n\\times [0,T)$, we have that $u$ is also smooth at time $T$ away from a closed set of Hausdorff dimension at most $n+2-4α$. Next we prove that, for the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^3$, there exists an operator $C(u,v)\\in \\mathfrak{B}$ that is an averaged version of $\\mathcal{E}$, that formally allows the dissipation of energy by the \"cancellation identity\" $\\langle C(u,u), u\\rangle =0$, and whose corresponding pseudodifferential equation $\\partial_t u +(-Δ)^αu +C(u,u)=0$ admits a solution that blows up in finite time for all $α\\in (0,5/4)$.",

  "comment": "56 pages. An error was pointed out in the section proving the partial regularity theorem. Thus, we must use an \"energy-barrier\" construction, the inclusion of which in our proof weakens the conclusion of our partial regularity theorem. It now applies to the hyperdissipative range $α\\in ((n+1)/4, (n+2)/4)$, where $n$ is the spatial dimension",
