  "abstract": "Next generation direct dark matter (DM) detection experiments will have unprecedented capabilities to explore coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$ν$NS) complementary to dedicated neutrino experiments. We demonstrate that future DM experiments can effectively probe nonstandard neutrino interactions (NSI) mediated by scalar fields in the scattering of solar and atmospheric neutrinos. We set first limits on $S_1$ leptoquark models that result in sizable $μ-d$ and $τ-d$ sector neutrino NSI CE$ν$NS contributions using LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) data. As we show, near future DM experiments reaching $\\sim \\mathcal{O}(100)$ton-year exposure, such as argon-based ARGO and xenon-based DARWIN, can probe parameter space of leptoquarks beyond the reach of current and planned collider facilities. We also analyze for the first time prospects for testing NSI in lead-based detectors. We discuss the ability of leptoquarks in the parameter space of interest to also explain the neutrino masses and $(g-2)_μ$ observations.",
