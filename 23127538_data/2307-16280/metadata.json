  "abstract": "We extend the chiral quark model for $u$, $d$, $c$ and $b$ quarks with vector mesons, which we proposed in the previous analysis, to a model with the $s$ quark. We include the nonet pseudo-scalar and vector mesons together with the singlet scalar meson based on the SU(3)$_L \\times$SU(3)$_R$ chiral symmetry combined with the Hidden Local Symmetry, which mediate force among $u$, $d$ and $s$ quarks. We fit the model parameters to the known ground state mesons and baryons. We show that the mass spectra of those hadrons are beautifully reproduced. We predict the masses of missing ground states, one meson and twenty baryons, which will be tested in the future experiment.",
