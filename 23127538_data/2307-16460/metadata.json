  "abstract": "Krylov subspace methods for solving linear systems of equations involving skew-symmetric matrices have gained recent attention. Numerical equivalences among Krylov subspace methods for nonsingular skew-symmetric linear systems have been given in Greif et al. [SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl., 37 (2016), pp. 1071--1087]. In this work, we extend the results of Greif et al. to singular skew-symmetric linear systems. In addition, we systematically study three Krylov subspace methods (called S$^3$CG, S$^3$MR, and S$^3$LQ) for solving shifted skew-symmetric linear systems. They all are based on Lanczos triangularization for skew-symmetric matrices, and correspond to CG, MINRES, and SYMMLQ for solving symmetric linear systems, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that studies S$^3$LQ. We give some new theoretical results on S$^3$CG, S$^3$MR, and S$^3$LQ. We also provide the relationship among the three methods and those based on Golub--Kahan bidiagonalization and Saunders--Simon--Yip tridiagonalization. Numerical examples are given to illustrate our theoretical findings.",
