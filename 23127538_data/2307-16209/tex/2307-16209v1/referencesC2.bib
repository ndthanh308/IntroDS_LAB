abstract = {In this paper, we study a certain linear statistics of the unitary Laguerre ensembles, motivated in part by an integrable quantum field theory at finite temperature. It transpires that this is equivalent to the characterization of a sequence of polynomials orthogonal with respect to the weight w(x)=w(x,s)≔xαe−xe−s/x,0≤x<∞,α>0,s>0, namely, the determination of the associated Hankel determinant and recurrence coefficients. Here w(x,s) is the Laguerre weight xαe−x perturbed by a multiplicative factor e−s/x, which induces an infinitely strong zero at the origin. For polynomials orthogonal on the unit circle, a particular example where there are explicit formulas, the weight of which has infinitely strong zeros, was investigated by Pollaczek and Szegö many years ago. Such weights are said to be singular or irregular due to the violation of the Szegö condition. In our problem, the linear statistics is a sum of the reciprocal of positive random variables {xj:j=1,…,n};∑j=1n1/xj. We show that the moment generating function, or the Laplace transform of the probability density function of this linear statistics, can be expressed as the ratio of Hankel determinants and as an integral involving a particular third Painlevé function.}

abstract="The general solution of a linear ordinary differential equation (ODE) with rational coefficients is generically multivalued. This property is described by a representation of the fundamental homotopy group of the complex plane deprived of the singular points, the monodromy representation. The idea of isomonodromic deformations, which traces back to Riemann in the middle of the nineteenth century, is to construct a family of linear ODEs that share a given monodromy representation. This leads to systems of linear partial differential equations, the integrability conditions of which are nonlinear differential equations that enjoy the Painlev{\'e} property. It is thus a powerful tool to associate linear with integrable nonlinear equations.",

Also widely known is the fact that the semi-axis [−μ,∞) is an anti-Stokes’ line for solutions of the differential equation Lu(z)=μu(z),z∈C, for each fixed value of the spectral parameter μ. In this paper, we show that this connection between the existence of anti-Stokes’ lines on the real axis and points of the absolutely continuous spectrum holds under much more general circumstances. Further correlations, relating the Stokes’ phenomenon to subordinacy properties of solutions of Lu=μu at infinity and to the boundary behaviour of the Titchmarsh–Weyl m-function on the real axis, are also deduced.}

abstract = {The six Painlevé equations (PI–PVI) were first discovered about a hundred years ago by Painlevé and his colleagues in an investigation of nonlinear second-order ordinary differential equations. Recently, there has been considerable interest in the Painlevé equations primarily due to the fact that they arise as reductions of the soliton equations which are solvable by inverse scattering. Consequently, the Painlevé equations can be regarded as completely integrable equations and possess solutions which can be expressed in terms of solutions of linear integral equations, despite being nonlinear equations. Although first discovered from strictly mathematical considerations, the Painlevé equations have arisen in a variety of important physical applications including statistical mechanics, plasma physics, nonlinear waves, quantum gravity, quantum field theory, general relativity, nonlinear optics and fibre optics. The Painlevé equations may be thought of a nonlinear analogues of the classical special functions. They possess hierarchies of rational solutions and one-parameter families of solutions expressible in terms of the classical special functions, for special values of the parameters. Further the Painlevé equations admit symmetries under affine Weyl groups which are related to the associated Bäcklund transformations. In this paper, I discuss some of the remarkable properties which the Painlevé equations possess including connection formulae, Bäcklund transformations associated discrete equations, and hierarchies of exact solutions. In particular, the second Painlevé equation PII is used to illustrate these properties and some of the applications of PII are also discussed.}

No further simplifying assumptions are made, but it is found that the absence of a term linear in y″ in the class of equations under investigation forces F to be a polynomial in y and y′. We find exactly six distinct classes of second-degree Painlevé equations, denoted SD-I,𠈆,SD-VI, some of which further subdivide into canonical subcases. Only the first three classes (or at least equations transformable to the first three classes) and part of the sixth have appeared previously in the literature, especially the work of Chazy and Bureau. The fourth and fifth classes are new. The unified treatment of SD-I, which we call the “master Painlevé equation,” is new. Complete solutions are given in terms of the classical Painlevé transcendents, elliptic functions, or solutions of linear equations. In an appendix, it is shown that a class of second-degree equations generalizing the Appell equation can always be reduced to a second-order linear equation.},

    abstract = { By considering suitable combinations of the Weyl scalars and the spin coefficients, the basic equations governing the perturbations of the Reissner–Nordström black hole, in the Newman–Penrose formalism, are decoupled; a fundamental pair of decoupled equations are obtained. It is then shown how this pair of decoupled equations can be transformed into one dimensional wave equations which are appropriate for describing the perturbations of odd and of even parity. A simple relation is obtained which will allow derivation of a solution belonging to one parity from a solution belonging to the opposite parity. Finally, equations are derived in terms of which one can readily ascertain how an arbitrary superposition of gravitational and electromagnetic waves, incident on the black hole, will be reflected and absorbed. }

This equation describes infinitesimal scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of rotating (Kerr) black holes. We derive analytic expressions for the eigenvalues up to sixth order in the expansion parameter for low frequencies and an analogous expansion in the high-frequency limit. Spinweighted spheroidal harmonics form a complete and orthonormal set of functions on a prolate spheroid. They are, however, not the eigenfunctions of the natural Laplace operator on a spheroid and thus do not allow an obvious geometrical interpretation as the corresponding spin-weighted spherical harmonics. }

abstract = {It is widely believed that the complete gravitational collapse of a body always results in a black hole (i.e., “naked singularities” can never be produced) and that all black holes eventually “settled down” to Kerr-Newman solutions. An important feature of the Kerr-Newman black holes is that they satisfy relation m2 ⩾ a2 + e2 where m is the mass of the black hole, e is its charge, a = Jm is its angular momentum per unit mass and geometrized units G = c = 1 are used. (For m2 <a2 + e2 the Kerr-Newman solutions describe naked singularities.) In this paper, we test the validity of the above conjectures on gravitational collapse by attempting to create a spacetime with m2 <a2 + e2 starting with a Kerr-Newman black hole with m2 = a2 + e2. Such a spacetime would either have to be a new black hole solution or a “naked singularity,” in violation of the above conjectures. In the first gedanken experiment we attempt to make the black hole capture a test particle having large charge and orbital angular momentum compared with energy. In the second gedanken experiment we attempt to drop into the black hole a spinning test body having large spin to mass ratio. In both cases we find that bodies which would cause violation of m2 ⩾ a2 + e2 will not be captured by the black hole, and, thus, we cannot obtain m2 <a2 + e2, although we can come arbitrarily close in the sense that m2 = a2 + e2 can be maintained in these processes.}

    abstract = { The gravitational quasi-normal frequencies of both stationary and rotating black holes are calculated by constructing exact eigensolutions to the radiative boundary-value problem of Chandrasekhar and Detweiler. The method is that employed by Jaffé in his determination of the electronic spectra of the hydrogen molecule ion in 1934, and analytic representations of the quasi-normal mode wavefunctions are presented here for the first time. Numerical solution of Jaffé’s characteristic equation indicates that for each l-pole there is an infinite number of damped Schwarzschild quasi-normal modes. The real parts of the corresponding frequencies are bounded, but the imaginary parts are not. Figures are presented that illustrate the trajectories the five least-damped of these frequencies trace in the complex frequency plane as the angular momentum of the black hole increases from zero to near the Kerr limit of maximum angular momentum per unit mass, a = M, where there is a coalescence of the more highly damped frequencies to the purely real value of the critical frequency for superradiant scattering. }

abstract = {Gravitational waves emitted by perturbed black holes or relativistic stars are dominated by `quasinormal ringing', damped oscillations at single frequencies which are characteristic of the underlying system. These quasinormal modes have been studied for a long time, often with the intent of describing the time evolution of a perturbation in terms of these modes in a way very similar to a normal-mode analysis. In this review, we summarize how quasinormal modes are defined and computed. We will see why they have been regarded as closely analogous to normal modes, and discover why they are actually quite different. We also discuss how quasinormal modes can be used in the analysis of a gravitational wave signal, such as will hopefully be detected in the near future.}

It is found that the expressions of the resonant frequencies for the charged scalar and Dirac fields with purely real δ are different because the parameters qs are different and the imaginary part has opposing symbol for the two fields. It is also shown that the long-lived resonant frequencies depend on the angular quantum numbers l and m. }

By using them, we can get the Teukolsky functions analytically in a desired accuracy. For the computation, the deep understanding of their properties is necessary. We summarize the main result: The relative normalization between the solutions with a spin weight s and -s is given analytically by using the Teukolsky-Starobinsky (T-S) identities. By examining the asymptotic behaviors of our solution and combined with the T-S identities and the Wronskian, we found nontrivial identities between the sums of coefficients of the series. These identities will serve to make various expression in simpler forms and also become a powerful tool to test the accuracy of the computation. As an application, we investigated the absorption rate and the evaporation rate of black hole and obtain interesting analytic results.},

@article{LivingRev.Rel.2:21999,
	abstract = {Perturbations of stars and black holes have been one of the main topics of relativistic astrophysics for the last few decades. They are of particular importance today, because of their relevance to gravitational wave astronomy. In this review we present the theory of quasi-normal modes of compact objects from both the mathematical and astrophysical points of view. The discussion includes perturbations of black holes (Schwarzschild, Reissner-Nordstr\"om, Kerr and Kerr-Newman) and relativistic stars (non-rotating and slowly-rotating). The properties of the various families of quasi-normal modes are described, and numerical techniques for calculating quasi-normal modes reviewed. The successes, as well as the limits, of perturbation theory are presented, and its role in the emerging era of numerical relativity and supercomputers is discussed.},

The non-linear deformation equations are derived and their complete integrability is proved. An explicit formula is found for a 1-form ω, expressed rationally in terms of the coefficients of A(x), that has the property dω=0 for each solution of the deformation equations. Examples corresponding to the “soliton” and “rational” solutions are discussed."}

In this paper a series of τ functions parametrized by integers are introduced. Their ratios to the original τ function are then shown to be explicit rational expressions in terms of the coefficients of A(x). We point out, and follow where possible, a close analogy between the theory of τ functions and that of classical theta functions."

It is shown that the general monodromy and spectrum preserving deformation equations can be written as Hirota's bilinear differential equations by using the τ-functions as dependent variables."

This equation describes infinitesimal scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of rotating (Kerr) black holes. We derive analytic expressions for the eigenvalues up to sixth order in the expansion parameter for low frequencies and an analogous expansion in the high-frequency limit. Spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics form a complete and orthonormal set of functions on a prolate spheroid. They are, however, not the eigenfunctions of the natural Laplace operator on a spheroid and thus do not allow an obvious geometrical interpretation as the corresponding spin-weighted spherical harmonics.},

We give a systematic description of the equations and their various properties, such as affine Weyl group symmetries, hypergeometric solutions and Lax pairs under this framework, by using the language of Picard lattice and root systems. We also provide with a collection of basic data; equations, point configurations/root data, Weyl group representations, Lax pairs, and hypergeometric solutions of all possible cases.}

Moreover, we show that these methods can also be used to obtain asymptotic behavior in other limits, e.g., when a parameter of the equation becomes large. The methods and results are illustrated here for the first and second Painlev{\'e} equations.",

 abstract = {We analyse the angular eigenfunctions-spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics-and eigenvalues of Teukolsky's equation. This equation describes infinitesimal scalar, electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations of rotating (Kerr) black holes. We derive analytic expressions for the eigenvalues up to sixth order in the expansion parameter for low frequencies and an analogous expansion in the high-frequency limit. Spin-weighted spheroidal harmonics form a complete and orthonormal set of functions on a prolate spheroid. They are, however, not the eigenfunctions of the natural Laplace operator on a spheroid and thus do not allow an obvious geometrical interpretation as the corresponding spin-weighted spherical harmonics.},
