  "abstract": "We have studied the tau-lepton polarization in the charged current $ν_τ/\\barν_τ$ induced deep inelastic scattering (DIS) from the free nucleon as well as off the nuclear targets that are being used in ongoing and proposed experiments such as IceCube, DUNE, etc. For the free nucleon target, the differential scattering cross sections are obtained by taking into account the non-perturbative effect like target mass corrections (TMC) and the perturbative effect like the evolution of the parton densities at the next-to-leading order (NLO) in the four flavor $\\overline{\\textrm{MS}}-$scheme. In the case of nucleons bound inside a nuclear target, we have incorporated the nuclear medium effects such as Fermi motion, binding energy and nucleon correlations, through the use of nucleon spectral function. We shall present the results for the differential scattering cross sections and the longitudinal and transverse components of the tau-lepton polarization assuming time reversal invariance.",
