  "abstract": "Identifying disturbances in network-coupled dynamical systems without knowledge of the disturbances or underlying dynamics is a problem with a wide range of applications. For example, one might want to know which nodes in the network are being disturbed and identify the type of disturbance. Here we present a model-free method based on machine learning to identify such unknown disturbances based only on prior observations of the system when forced by a known training function. We find that this method is able to identify the locations and properties of many different types of unknown disturbances using a variety of known forcing functions. We illustrate our results both with linear and nonlinear disturbances using food web and neuronal activity models. Finally, we discuss how to scale our method to large networks.",
