  "abstract": "During reading, dyslexic readers exhibit more and longer fixations than normal readers. However, there is no significant difference when dyslexic and control readers perform only visual tasks on a string of letters, showing the importance of cognitive processes in reading. This linguistic and cognitive processing demand in reading is often perturbed for dyslexic readers by perceived additional letter and word mirror-images superposed to the primary images on the primary cortex, inducing an internal visual crowding. Here we show that whereas for a normal reader, the number and the duration of fixations remain invariant whatever the nature of the lighting, the excess of fixations and total duration of reading can be controlled for a dyslexic reader using the Hebbian mechanisms to erase the extra images in an optimized pulse-width lighting. The number of fixations can be reduced by a factor of about 1.8, recovering the normal reader records.",
