  "abstract": "The dimensions of liquid scintillator neutrino detectors have grown over the years. Thus, the analog cable length required for the readout increases. In consequence, the signal loss increases as well. With the intelligent Photomultiplier Tube this problem can be solved. The digitiser is moved as close as possible to the Photomultiplier Tube. This concept allows nearly lossless digitisation of the analog signal. Furthermore, a computing unit next to the analog-to-digital converter enables implementation of on-the-fly data processing and control algorithms. This paper presents the detailed concept and the performance of the intelligent Photomultiplier Tube.",
