\subsection{Cable}
The connection between the \ac{iPMT} and the \acf{SB} is a single CAT5 cable with four twisted wire-pairs.
Two pairs are used for the \qty{100}{\mega\bit\per\second} Ethernet with embedded \ac{POE}. The third pair hosts the synchronous connection from the SB to the iPMT, whereas the fourth pair is used for synchronous transmission from the iPMT to the SB.

The whole CAT5 cable is enwrapped in a metal mesh shielding and \replace{an}{a} \ac{HDPE} coat. This outer mantle is compatible with the ultra-pure water in the detector tank. The \ac{HDPE} coat is filled with a water blocking powder. In case of damage, the powder prevents propagation of water along the cable.

For \ac{OSIRIS}, a maximum cable length of \qty{25}{\meter} is required~\cite{OSIRISDesign}. During installation of the \acp{iPMT}, this cable can be cut to the right length. The technical limit is given by the Ethernet requirements. Typically this limit is \qty{90}{\meter}. During the production tests, the cable has been elongated by additional \qty{20}{\meter}. No communication problem could be observed with this configuration.
