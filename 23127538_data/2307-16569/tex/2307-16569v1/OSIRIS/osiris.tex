\section{\acs{OSIRIS}}
\label{sec:osiris}
The \ac{OSIRIS} experiment is a facility to monitor the internal radiopurity of the scintillator used in the \ac{JUNO} experiment during filling. For this purpose, a fraction of the \ac{LS} is fed continuously into \ac{OSIRIS}~\cite{OSIRISDesign}.
%\ac{OSIRIS} is also used for the commissioning of the \ac{LS} purification systems of \ac{JUNO}.
The commissioning of the \ac{LS} purification systems of \ac{JUNO} is also monitored by \ac{OSIRIS}.

The detector is separated into the inner detector, which consists of the \ac{LS} contained in the acrylic vessel and the outer detector, that uses the shielding water as a Cherenkov muon veto. The light produced in both detector parts is detected by \acp{PMT}. 
%\ac{OSIRIS} uses \qty{76}{\acsp{PMT}} in total. 
The outer detector is instrumented by \qty{12}{\acsp{PMT}}. Further \qty{64}{\acsp{PMT}} are pointing towards the center of the acrylic vessel (cf. Figure~\ref{fig:osiris_layout}).
