\subsection{\acl{SCCU}}
The \ac{SCCU} provides access to all slow monitoring sensors as well as the low level and debugging access to VULCAN and the \ac{FPGA}.

This board hosts \replace{an}{a}\R{A139} \emph{STM32F417} microcontroller, which provides though its firmware access to \ac{JTAG}, \ac{I2C}, and \ac{UART} via Ethernet. This board hosts a four port Ethernet switch joining the datastreams from the \ac{ROB} and the \ac{SCCU} \add{itself}\R{A142}. One port is the uplink to the \ac{SB}, one connects to the \ac{ROB}, the third one is for the microcontroller, while the fourth one is not used. The access to \ac{JTAG} is implemented using the \ac{XVC} \cite{XVC}. This allows usage of the full \ac{FPGA} tool chain. Via a custom \add{defined protocol over} \ac{UDP}\R{A145}, one can access two \ac{I2C} busses, which are connected to many sensors, which monitor the systems behaviour. The three \ac{UART} connections are accessible via \ac{TELNET} protocol. For each connection, the baudrate as well as the new line character can be configured remotely. The configuration is stored in the internal EEPROM of the microcontroller. Two of the \acp{UART} are routed to the \ac{FPGA} and the third one is converted into \emph{RS485} and connected to the HV module.
