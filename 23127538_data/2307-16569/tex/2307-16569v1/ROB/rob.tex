\subsection{\acl{ROB}}
The \ac{ROB} is the main board in the readout chain (cf.  Figure~\ref{fig:rob_board}). It digitizes the signal, provides the timestamps of the waveform packets, and contains the digital processing unit, a \Xilinx~\ZYNQ\footnote{FPGA (Artix-7) and a Dual-Core ARM Cortex-A9 MPCore.}.

For dataprocessing, \qty{1}{\giga\byte} of \ac{RAM} is connected~\cite{WysotzkiPhD}.

All \acp{iPMT} are synchronised by a dedicated synchronous link running at \qty{125}{\mega\bit\per\second}. This link embeds a data stream and a clock via Manchester Coding~\cite[142]{Stallings2007}. On the \ac{ROB}, this stream is processed by a \ac{CDR} \ac{IC} (Microchip SY87700AL) and split into a data and clock signal again.
