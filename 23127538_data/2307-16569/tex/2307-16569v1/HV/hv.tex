\subsection{High Voltage Board}

The high voltage board hosts a high voltage module \cite{Bellato_2021}. The decoupling of the signal from the \ac{HV} is done on this board as well. In order to protect the subsequent components, two gas discharge tubes are added to this board. They limit the voltage to a maximum of \qty{70}{\volt}. To prevent charge-up of the secondary side of the decoupling capacitor, a high ohmic discharge resistor is installed. 
The influence on the signal by the discharge resistor and tubes is negligible.
