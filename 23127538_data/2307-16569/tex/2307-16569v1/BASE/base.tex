\subsection{Voltage Divider (Base)}
The voltage divider follows the reference design by Hamamatsu with a few modifications. For a safe operation, the clearance between the \ac{HV} and the ground traces is adapted according to the voltage. This gives the maximum ground trace thickness. Except for one \qty{10}{\nano\farad}/\qty{6}{\kilo\volt} capacitor all components are \ac{SMT} types. The base itself gets soldered to the connector of the \ac{PMT}.
