In consequence, the signal loss increases as well. With the intelligent \acl{PMT} this problem can be solved. The digitiser is moved as close as possible to the \acl{PMT}. This concept allows nearly lossless digitisation of the analog signal.
Furthermore, a computing unit next to the \acl{ADC} enables implementation of on-the-fly data processing and control algorithms. 
This paper presents the detailed concept and the performance of the intelligent \acl{PMT}.
