\section{Summary / Conclusions}

The \ac{iPMT} concept is a novel \ac{PMT} readout concept based on the close integration of the \ac{PMT} and electronics. We presented a detailed description of the system components. It is shown that a partial synchronisation can be achieved, which has a sufficiently low uncertainty.
The performance of one exemplary \ac{iPMT} is presented, focusing on low light level characteristics.
\add{In the charge performance this \ac{iPMT} achieved a signal to noise ratio of \num[round-mode=uncertainty]{\chargeSNR +- \chargeSNRUncert} and a resolution of \qty[round-mode=uncertainty]{\chargeResolution +- \chargeResolutionUncert}{\%} for single photon events}\R{A322_concl}.

For \ac{OSIRIS}, \qty{75}{\acp{iPMT}} have been successfully produced, tested and shipped to the \ac{JUNO} site for installation. \remove{Due to unforeseen problems and the necessary repairs of the {iPMT}, they are not installed in the first phase of {OSIRIS}. They will be used in the future upgrade of {OSIRIS} focusing on the search for solar $pp$ neutrinos.}\R{A322}
