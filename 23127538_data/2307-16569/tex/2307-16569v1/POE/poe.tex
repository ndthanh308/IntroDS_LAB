\subsection{\acl{POE}}
The whole \ac{iPMT} is powered by \ac{POE} using \ac{POE} Plus (\mbox{IEEE~802.3at-2009}) Class 4. This allows the device to consume up to \qty{25.5}{\watt}. Eventhough this limit is never reached by the \ac{iPMT}, it provides some margin for future extensions of the \ac{FPGA} functionality.

The \ac{POE} signal is rectified using an ideal diode bridge and then fed into the \ac{POE} power delivery protocol handling \ac{IC}. The \qty{48}{\volt} rail is connected to two DC/DC converters. One provides an isolated \qty{24}{\volt} output for the \ac{HV} module. The other one is an isolated \qty{5}{\volt} regulator supplying the \ac{SCCU} and the \ac{ROB}. On these boards, the \qty{5}{\volt} is regulated down to the voltages needed on these boards. On the \ac{POE} board, a temperature monitoring for the transformer of the \qty{5}{\volt} regulator is implemented. The supply voltage and current of the HV module is measured, too. These sensors allow continuous monitoring of the operational conditions.
