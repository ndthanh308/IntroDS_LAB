  "abstract": "Using high resolution tender-x-ray resonant inelastic scattering and hard-x-ray non-resonant inelastic scattering beyond the dipole limit we were able to detect electronic excitations in intermetallic UGa$_2$ that are highly atomic in nature. Analysis of the spectral lineshape reveals that the local $5f^2$ configuration characterizes the correlated nature of this ferromagnet. The orientation and directional dependence of the spectra indicate that the ground state is made of the $ﾎ点1$ singlet and/or $ﾎ点6$ doublet symmetry. With the ordered moment in the $ab$ plane, we infer that the magnetism originates from the higher lying $ﾎ点6$ doublet being mixed with the $ﾎ点1$ singlet due to inter-site exchange, qualifying UGa$_2$ to be a true quantum magnet. The ability to observe atomic excitations is crucial to resolve the on-going debate about the degree of localization versus itineracy in U intermetallics.",
