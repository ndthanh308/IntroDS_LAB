  "abstract": "A simple routine is proposed for monitoring the efficiency value of a low pressure pentane filled multi-wire proportional chamber (MWPC) in long term experiments. The proposed algorithm utilizes a two parameter approximation for the background function. It is based on a linear approximation of the background in the energy range of 4.8 to 10.0 MeV and an exponential approximation of the neutron induced tail in the 1.5 to 4.2 MeV region. This specific energy interval is used to measure the efficiency value. Prior to discussing the algorithm, a description of the DGFRS-2 setup detection module is provided. Additionally, an example of its application is presented for the complete fusion of a heavy ion induced 232Th+48Ca = Ds complete fusion nuclear reaction. Descriptions of two other two-parameter functional dependencies for background approximations are also provided. A feature of this algorithm is that there is no interruption of the main experiment for a calibration test (reaction). An alternative scenario is considered in brief too. In consist of a measurement of scattered target like ions in 30 to 45 MeV energy interval to estimate an efficiency value.",
