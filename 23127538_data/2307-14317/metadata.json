  "abstract": "The challenge of removing cancerous cells lies in the limitation of organ at risk, which restricts the ability to increase the radiation dose adequately for enhancing treatment effectiveness. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the 4π planning technique for radiation therapy. In radiation therapy, the gantry of Medical linear accelerators can rotate around the couch to administer radiation from various angles. Researchers have introduced the 4π technique with the objective of increasing the radiation dose to tumors while minimizing damage to nearby organs. While dose escalation may not be feasible in certain cases due to potential complications in normal tissues, the 4π technique enables dose escalation for certain types of cancers. The optimization problem formulation constitutes a major innovation in the 4π technique. In this survey, we went thorough optimization problem of 4π technique and discussed about the available investigations that have been performed on 4π technique.",
