  abstract = {This article describes a new numerical scheme to model surface tension for an interface represented by a level-set function. In contrast with previous schemes, the method conserves fluid momentum and recovers Laplace's equilibrium exactly. It is formally consistent and does not require the introduction of an arbitrary interface thickness, as is classically done when approximating surface-to-volume operators using Dirac functions. Variable surface tension is naturally taken into account by the scheme and accurate solutions are obtained for thermocapillary flows. Application to the Marangoni breakup of an axisymmetric droplet shows that the method is robust also in the case of changes in the interface topology.},

  abstract = {This study is motivated by the observation that the drag-reduction effectiveness achieved by the imposition of oscillatory spanwise wall motion declines with Reynolds number. The question thus posed is whether the decline is linked to the increasingly strong influence of large-scale outer structures in the log layer on the near-wall turbulence, in general, and the streak strength in the viscosity-affected layer, in particular \textendash{} a process referred to as modulation. This question is addressed via an extensive statistical analysis of DNS data for a channel flow at a friction Reynolds number 1020, subjected to oscillatory spanwise wall motion at a nominal wall-scaled period of 100. The analysis rests on a separation of turbulent scales by means of the Empirical Mode Decomposition. This method is used to derive conditional statistics of small-scale motions and skin friction subject to prescribed intensity of large-scale motions \textendash{} referred to as footprinting. It is shown that the large-scale fluctuations are responsible, directly on their own, for roughly 30\% to the skin friction. Positive large-scale fluctuations are also shown to be the cause of a major amplification of small-scale streaks, relative to weak attenuation by negative fluctuations. This highly asymmetric process is likely to be indirectly influential on the drag-reduction process, although it is not possible to identify this indirect effect in quantitative terms as part of the present analysis.},

Because of the agronomical and environmental impacts of this phenomenon, drift has been widely studied and extensive information is available. Here we present a literature review on the relationships between global physical descriptors of agricultural sprays, air conditions and resulting drift, generally studied in wind tunnels. Basic physical factors are droplet size, droplet velocity, and the physicochemical characteristics of the sprayed product. When possible, data available in the literature are collated to draw trends. Contradictory information sometimes appears especially regarding droplet velocity and drift control. The main physical factors consist generally of medians such as Volume Median Diameter (VMD or Dv50) that do not always represent the heterogeneity of a spray and especially the spatial distribution of particle size and velocity. Technological parameters such as nozzle height, spray angle, travel speed are then related to initial physical factors and their contribution to driftability of sprays.},

There is a considerable effect of heterogeneity on the values of the higher moments, and a small but measurable effect on the mean value.

  abstract = {In the present study, a novel air-assisted impinging jet atomization is demonstrated. A configuration in which a gas jet is directed on to the impinging point of two liquid jets is used to improve the atomization. The effect of liquid properties such as viscosity and surface tension, angle between liquid jets and gas injection orifice diameter on spray characteristics has been experimentally studied. Backlit imaging and particle/droplet imaging and analysis techniques are utilized to characterize the sprays. The experimental results indicate that the effect of liquid viscosity is significant on the liquid sheet break up formed by the impinging jets. However, surface tension does not affect the spray structure significantly in this mode of atomization. At low liquid jet velocity, the prompt mode of atomization is observed where as atomization occurs in classical mode at higher liquid jet velocity. Results showed that variation in the angle between liquid jets do not affect the breakup phenomenon significantly. The spray angle is computed by finding the angle between the lines joining the impinging point and spray edge at an axial distance of 15mm downstream of the impinging point from the ensemble-averaged data over 100 spray images. It was observed that effect of liquid jets impinging angle on the spray angle is higher at higher liquid velocity. Higher viscosity liquids exhibit lower spray angles. Droplet size measurements indicate a radial variation in the spray. An overall Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD) value is obtained by combining the droplet statistics at all radial locations at a fixed axial location. A very interesting trend is that the SMD is constant beyond a critical Gas to Liquid Ratio (GLR) and momentum ratio for a large variation in liquid viscosity and surface tension. This observation has important ramifications for fuel flexible systems.},

  abstract = {The turbulent/non-turbulent interface is analysed in a direct numerical simulation of a boundary layer in the range Re\texttheta{} = 2800-6600, with emphasis on the behaviour of the relatively large-scale fractal intermittent region. This requires the introduction of a new definition of the distance between a point and a general surface, which is compared with the more usual vertical distance to the top of the layer. Interfaces are obtained by thresholding the enstrophy field and the magnitude of the rate-of-strain tensor, and it is concluded that, while the former are physically relevant features, the latter are not. By varying the threshold, a topological transition is identified as the interface moves from the free stream into the turbulent core. A vorticity scale is defined that collapses that transition for different Reynolds numbers, roughly equivalent to the root-mean-squared vorticity at the edge of the boundary layer. Conditionally averaged flow variables are analysed as functions of the new distance, both within and outside the interface. It is found that the interface contains a nonequilibrium layer whose thickness scales well with the Taylor microscale, enveloping a self-similar layer spanning a fixed fraction of the boundary-layer thickness. Interestingly, the straining structure of the flow is similar in both regions. Irrotational pockets within the turbulent core are also studied. They form a self-similar set whose size decreases with increasing depth, presumably due to break-up by the turbulence, but the rate of viscous diffusion is independent of the pocket size. The raw data used in the analysis are freely available from our web page (http://torroja.dmt.upm.es).},

  abstract = {Violent respiratory events such as coughs and sneezes play a key role in transferring respiratory diseases between infectious and susceptible individuals. We present the results of a combined experimental and theoretical investigation of the fluid dynamics of such violent expiratory events. Direct observation of sneezing and coughing events reveals that such flows are multiphase turbulent buoyant clouds with suspended droplets of various sizes. Our observations guide the development of an accompanying theoretical model of pathogen-bearing droplets interacting with a turbulent buoyant momentum puff. We develop in turn discrete and continuous models of droplet fallout from the cloud in order to predict the range of pathogens. According to the discrete fallout model droplets remain suspended in the cloud until their settling speed matches that of the decelerating cloud. A continuous fallout model is developed by adapting models of sedimentation from turbulent fluids. The predictions of our theoretical models are tested against data gathered from a series of analogue experiments in which a particle-laden cloud is ejected into a relatively dense ambient. Our study highlights the importance of the multiphase nature of respiratory clouds, specifically the suspension of the smallest drops by circulation within the cloud, in extending the range of respiratory pathogens.},

  abstract = {A new method for modeling surface tension effects on fluid motion has been developed. Interfaces between fluids of different properties, or ``colors,'' are represented as transition regions of finite thickness, across which the color variable varies continuously. At each point in the transition region, a force density is defined which is proportional to the curvature of the surface of constant color at that point. It is normalized so that the conventional description of surface tension on an interface is recovered when the ratio of local transition region thickness to local radius of curvature approaches zero. The continuum method eliminates the need for interface reconstruction, simplifies the calculation of surface tension, enables accurate modeling of two- and three-dimensional fluid flows driven by surface forces, and does not impose any modeling restrictions on the number, complexity, or dynamic evolution of fluid interfaces having surface tension. Computational results for two-dimensional flows are given to illustrate the properties of the method.},

  abstract = {The well defined atomization of liquid fuels plays a key role in the combustion process of civil jet engines, in particular for minimizing toxic emissions. Presently, the breakup mechanisms leading to a wide range of droplet sizes and trajectories are not understood in detail. Furthermore, reliable numerical predictions have not been feasible due to the enormous computational costs associated with the simulation of air-assisted atomization. In this paper we present a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of an experimentally investigated planar prefilming air-blast atomizer at one operating point. The numerical investigation is carried out using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method. The spatial resolution of 5~\textmu m yields a domain size of 1.2 billion particles. Due to the superior serial and parallel performance of the method, 122 channel flow-through times of the air flow could be realized consuming a rather small amount of computational resources. Within the simulated physical period of time of 14.6~ms, two main breakup events could be detected. As a converged statistical analysis of the resulting fuel spray properties is not possible, the quantitative comparison to the experimental findings is based on single event statistics. In this work we analyze the characteristic volumetric droplet diameters DV0.1, DV0.5 and DV0.9 and the Sauter Mean Diameter D32. Both quantitatively as well as with regard to the phenomenology of the breakup processes, the simulation matches extremely well the experimental observations. This work demonstrates, that reliable simulations of air-assisted atomization have come into reach by combining the highly efficient numerical method SPH with massive computing power.},

The liquid expands radially from the impacting point forming a sheet in the form of a bay leaf bounded by a thicker rim. The sheet shape, rim size and liquid velocity field are quantified and represented analytically. External harmonic perturbations of the injection conditions reveal the nature of the rim destabilization and of its coupling with the sheet. Flow perturbations in the incident jets lead to sheet thickness modulations which trigger the fragmentation of the rim via the formation of liquid ligaments whose dynamics is described. The breakup of these ligaments induce both the shape and width of the drop size distribution in the spray formed by this process.},

  abstract = {This study employs DNS of two-phase flows to enhance primary atomization understanding and modeling to be used in numerical simulation in RANS or LES framework. In particular, the work has been aimed at improving the information on the liquid-gas interface evolution for modeling approaches, such as the Eulerian\textendash Lagrangian Spray Atomization (ELSA) framework. Even though this approach has been already successfully employed to describe the complete liquid atomization process from the primary region to the dilute spray, improvements are still expected on the derivation of the drop size distribution (DSD). The main aim of the present work is the introduction of a new framework to achieve a continuous description of the DSD formation during the atomization process. The attention is here focused on the extraction from DNS data of the behavior of geometrical variable of the liquid-gas interface, such as the mean (H) and Gauss (G) surface curvatures. The use of a Surface Curvature Distribution is also proposed and studied. A Rayleigh\textendash Plateau instability along a column of liquid and a droplet collision case are first of all considered to analyze and to verify the capabilities of the code to correctly predicting the curvature distributions. A statistical analysis based on the curvatures data, in terms of probability density function, is presented in order to determine the physical parameters that control the curvatures on this test case. Then, the same formulation is applied in the analysis of the two phase Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence (HIT) configuration to study how the curvatures evolve all along the atomization process. Joint PDFs are used to illustrate the topological changes of the interface when increasing the liquid volume fraction.},

  abstract = {A new atomization model for prefilming airblast atomizers is presented and applied in the Large-Eddy Simulation of an academic experiment. The model, named PAMELA, expresses the drop size Probability Density Function of the spray in the form of a Rosin\textendash Rammler distribution whose parameters depend on flow conditions. A mechanism of liquid fragmentation is proposed where a Rayleigh\textendash Taylor instability develops in the transverse direction. The wavelength of this instability (i) is assumed to be proportional to the Sauter Mean Diameter of the spray, and (ii) scales with a Weber number based on the atomizing edge thickness, providing a first link between flow conditions and the Rosin\textendash Rammler parameters. The second link is found by introducing a second Weber number based on the thickness of the boundary layer developing on the prefilmer. A first comparison with academic experiments shows that the model assumptions are valid and allows to calibrate the model constants. PAMELA is then implemented in a LES solver to perform the numerical simulation of an academic airblast atomizer. The obtained drop size distribution and spatial structure of the spray are in good agreement with measurements, demonstrating the validity of the proposed approach in the context of LES, and that the proposed PAMELA model may now be used to describe the liquid spray in LES of industrial nozzles.},

  abstract = {In the context of biofuel production, a twin-fluid atomizer is investigated by the means of the Weakly-Compressible Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (WCSPH) method. This configuration consists of a round liquid jet discharging at low velocity into a quiescent cavity. The liquid is atomized by a high-speed turbulent co-flow. This configuration has been studied experimentally as well. In order to reflect the experimental conditions, the liquid is a mixture of Glycerol and water and a constant viscosity is set to 200 mPa s. The ambient pressure is 11 bar and the gas velocity is 58.3 m/s, leading to a gas Reynolds number of 137 000 and a Weber number of 1375. The three-dimensional numerical domain consists of the twin-fluid nozzle and a cavity of 30 mm length and 17.4 mm diameter. The spatial resolution is 33 \textbackslash textmu m, which leads to 208 million of particles. The simulation is run for 45 ms of physical time using 2000 CPU. The results show that the fiber-mode breakup is well captured by the method. The shape and the dynamics of the fragmented liquid lumps are in very good qualitative agreement with the experimental observations. Further quantitative analyses are performed in terms of time average of the liquid phase, and time evolution of the spray characteristics at the exit of the cavity. Finally, due to the Lagrangian nature of the SPH method, the breakup sequence of each liquid elements can be monitored and collected. Hence, the fragmentation spectrum of this configuration is also presented.},

  abstract = {The term plasma actuator has now been a part of the fluid dynamics flowcontrol vernacular for more than a decade. A particular type of plasma actuator that has gained wide use is based on a single\textendash dielectric barrier discharge (SDBD) mechanism that has desirable features for use in air at atmospheric pressures. For these actuators, the mechanism of flow control is through a generated body-force vector field that couples with the momentum in the external flow. The body force can be derived from first principles, and the effect of plasma actuators can be easily incorporated into flow solvers so that their placement and operation can be optimized. They have been used in a wide range of internal and external flow applications. Although initially considered useful only at low speeds, plasma actuators are effective in a number of applications at high subsonic, transonic, and supersonic Mach numbers, owing largely to more optimized actuator designs that were developed through better understanding and modeling of the actuator physics. New applications continue to appear through a growing number of programs in the United States, Germany, France, England, the Netherlands, Russia, Australia, Japan, and China. This review provides an overview of the physics and modeling of SDBD plasma actuators. It highlights some of the capabilities of plasma actuators through examples from experiments and simulations.},

The smallest components, i.e., drops and bubbles generated by breaking waves, play an outsize role. This fascinating problem is characterized by a wide range of length scales, from wind forcing the wave field at scales of {$\mathscr{O}$}(1 km\textendash 0.1 m) to the dynamics of wave breaking at {$\mathscr{O}$}(10\textendash 0.1 m); air bubble entrainment, dynamics, and dissolution in the water column at {$\mathscr{O}$}(1 m\textendash 10 {$\mu$}m); and bubbles bursting at {$\mathscr{O}$}(10 mm\textendash 1 {$\mu$}m), generating sea spray droplets at {$\mathscr{O}$}(0.5 mm\textendash 0.5 {$\mu$}m) that are ejected into atmospheric turbulent boundary layers. I discuss recent progress to bridge these length scales, identifying the controlling processes and proposing a path toward mechanistic parameterizations of air\textendash sea mass exchange that naturally accounts for sea state effects.

  abstract = {Linear instability predictions of liquid sheets injected into a gas medium are well established in the literature. These analyses are often used in Lagrangian-Eulerian spray simulations, a prominent simulation method, to model the dynamics occurring in the near-nozzle region. In the present work, these instability predictions are re-examined by first generalizing the treatment of interfacial conditions and related assumptions with a two-phase Orr-Sommerfeld (OS) system, and second, by employing highly resolved-Volume-of-Fluid (VoF) simulations. After presenting some validation exercises for both the VoF and OS solvers, the OS predictions are compared to earlier studies from the literature leading to reasonable agreement in the limit as the boundary layer thickness tends to zero. Results from VoF simulations of liquid sheet injection are used to characterize the range of scales of the liquid structures immediately before atomization. The mean value in this range is found to be approximately two to three orders of magnitude larger than the corresponding predictions from previous studies. A two-phase mixing layer under the same physical conditions is used to examine this disparity, revealing that within the linear regime, relatively good agreement exists between the VoF and OS predicted instability mechanisms. However, the most unstable mode in the linear regime is too small to cause a fracture or atomization of the liquid sheet and hence cannot be directly responsible for the atomization. The generation of a much larger mode, which emerges well beyond the linear regime, is the one causing breakup.},

In this review, we carry out a survey of the prominent methods, including optical techniques and approaches based on medical imaging. An overview of each is given with an example of an application from the literature, while focusing on their respective strengths and challenges. A framework for the evaluation of velocimetry performance in terms of dynamic spatial range is discussed, along with technological trends and emerging strategies to exploit 3D data. While critical challenges still exist, these observations highlight how volumetric techniques are transforming experimental fluid mechanics, and that the possibilities they offer have just begun to be explored.},

An exact self-similar solution to the linearized equations is successfully compared to experiments made with millimetric ligaments. Another non-linear self-similar solution of the full set of equations is found numerically. Both the linear and non-linear solutions show that the axial depth at which the liquid is affected by the motion of the cylinder scales like \$\textbackslash sqrt\{t\}\$. The non-linear solution presents the peculiar feature that there exists a maximum driving velocity \$U\^\textbackslash star\$ above which the solution disappears, a phenomenon probably related to the de-pinning of the contact line observed in experiments for large pulling velocities.},

The Weber number being kept low, the sprays produced by these injectors depend on the liquid flow characteristics only, and more precisely, on the non-axial kinetic energy and of the turbulent kinetic energy at the nozzle exit. The investigation reported here concentrates on the characterization of liquid flows during atomization by measuring the spatial variation of the local interface length and of the local interface fractal dimension. Both parameters were found representative of the physics of atomization process: they depend on the characteristics of the flow issuing from the nozzle and they are related to the subsequent drop size distribution. The local interface length is representative of the amount of liquid\textendash gas interface surface area, and is a function of both the non-axial and the turbulent kinetic energies at the nozzle exit. The fractal dimension is representative of the tortuosity of the liquid\textendash gas interface and, as expected, is mainly related to the turbulent kinetic energy at the nozzle exit. As far as the drop size distribution is concerned, it is found that the local interface length at the instant of break-up determines a representative drop diameter of some kind, whereas the fractal dimension at the same instant controls the dispersion of the distribution.},

The intermediate step\textemdash the primary breakup mechanism\textemdash covers the early liquid flow deformation down to the production of the first isolated liquid fragments. This step is very important and requires to be fully understood since it constitutes the link between the flow issuing from the atomizer and the final spray. This paper reviews the experimental investigations dedicated to this early atomization step. Several situations are considered: cylindrical liquid jets, flat liquid sheets, air-assisted cylindrical liquid jets and air-assisted flat liquid sheets. Each fluid stream adopts several atomization regimes according to the operating conditions. These regimes as well as the significant parameters they depend on are listed. The main instability mechanisms, which control primary breakup processes, are rather well described. This review points out the internal geometrical nozzle characteristics and internal flow details that influence the atomization mechanisms. The contributions of these characteristics, which require further investigations to be fully identified and quantified, are believed to be the main reason of experimental discrepancies and explain a lack of universal primary breakup regime categorizations.},

  abstract = {At low Weber numbers, the aerodynamic forces due to the interaction between gas and liquid do not influence liquid atomization processes. In these situations, atomization processes depend on issuing liquid flow characteristics only. According to the literature, the atomization efficiency is best when the issuing liquid flow shows a high turbulence level. Some injectors are based on this concept and promote the production of turbulence by imposing deflection of the flow inside the nozzle. However, many studies indicate that the level of turbulence does not solely control the atomization efficiency. By conducting a numerical and experimental study on the behavior of cavity nozzles, it is found that internal flow deflection to produce turbulence also produces a non-axial flow component at the nozzle exit whose effect on the atomization process is of paramount importance. Indeed, the results show that the surface energy produced during the atomization process is linearly dependent on the sum of the turbulent kinetic energy and the non-axial kinetic energy at the nozzle exit. This sum represents the energy available for the atomization process, and the influence of the injection pressure as well as of the nozzle geometry on this energy is investigated.},

This model has been used successfully in many studies to describe the complete liquid atomization process from primary atomization to the dispersed spray. A two-phase flow homogeneous isotropic turbulence was used for the numerical configuration. A statistical analysis of the equilibrium Weber number was performed with a DNS of two-phase flows to verify the definition given by the ELSA model. This verification was carried out for various liquid volume fractions, mesh resolutions, and surface tensions. An ensemble averaging of the time evolution of the interface density was performed to check the validity of the interface density equation used in the ELSA model. Proposed improvements of the ELSA model were compared with the reference DNS for multiple configurations. The new proposal shows good agreement with the DNS.},

  abstract = {Magnetic resonance velocimetry (MRV) is a non-invasive technique capable of measuring the three-component mean velocity field in complex three-dimensional geometries with either steady or periodic boundary conditions. The technique is based on the phenomenon of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and works in conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) magnets used for clinical imaging. Velocities can be measured along single lines, in planes, or in full 3D volumes with sub-millimeter resolution. No optical access or flow markers are required so measurements can be obtained in clear or opaque MR compatible flow models and fluids. Because of its versatility and the widespread availability of MRI scanners, MRV is seeing increasing application in both biological and engineering flows. MRV measurements typically image the hydrogen protons in liquid flows due to the relatively high intrinsic signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Nonetheless, lower SNR applications such as fluorine gas flows are beginning to appear in the literature. MRV can be used in laminar and turbulent flows, single and multiphase flows, and even non-isothermal flows. In addition to measuring mean velocity, MRI techniques can measure turbulent velocities, diffusion coefficients and tensors, and temperature. This review surveys recent developments in MRI measurement techniques primarily in turbulent liquid and gas flows. A general description of MRV provides background for a discussion of its accuracy and limitations. Techniques for decreasing scan time such as parallel imaging and partial k-space sampling are discussed. MRV applications are reviewed in the areas of physiology, biology, and engineering. Included are measurements of arterial blood flow and gas flow in human lungs. Featured engineering applications include the scanning of turbulent flows in complex geometries for CFD validation, the rapid iterative design of complex internal flow passages, velocity and phase composition measurements in multiphase flows, and the scanning of flows through porous media. Temperature measurements using MR thermometry are discussed. Finally, post-processing methods are covered to demonstrate the utility of MRV data for calculating relative pressure fields and wall shear stresses.},

Existing measurements of dense-spray structure are limited to round pressure-atomized sprays in still gases and show that the dispersed flow region is surprisingly dilute, that separated flow effects are significant because the flow is dilute and developing, and that atomization involves primary breakup at the liquid surface followed by secondary breakup, while effects of collisions are small. Available information about secondary breakup emphasizes breakup due to shock wave disturbances at large liquid/gas density ratios and shows that secondary breakup is a dominant feature of dense sprays that must be resolved as a function of time so that secondary breakup can be properly treated as a rate process. Finaily, available information about primary breakup has been dominated by effects of disturbances in the injector passage; therefore, while some understanding of turbulent primary breakup has been achieved, more information about aerodynamic primary breakup is needed to address practical spray combustion processes.},

The new algorithm is based on the direct discretization of the collision/coalescence kernel derived in the framework of a joint fluid\textendash particle pdf approach proposed by Simonin et al. (2002). This approach allows to take into account correlations between colliding inertial particle velocities induced by their interaction with the fluid turbulence. Validation is performed by comparing the Monte-Carlo predictions with deterministic simulations of discrete solid particles coupled with Direct Numerical Simulation (DPS/DNS), or Large Eddy Simulation (DPS/LES), where the collision/coalescence effects are treated in a deterministic way. Five cases are investigated: elastic monodisperse particles, non-elastic monodisperse particles, binary mixture of elastic particles and binary mixture of elastic settling particles in turbulent flow and finally coalescing droplets. The predictions using the new Monte-Carlo algorithm are in much better agreement with DPS/DNS results than the ones using the standard algorithm.},

  abstract = {Kinetic equations containing terms for spatial transport, body forces, and particle\textendash particle collisions occur in many applications (e.g., rarefied gases, dilute granular gases, fluid-particle flows). The direct numerical solution of the kinetic equation is usually intractable due to the large number of independent variables. A useful alternative is to reformulate the problem in terms of the moments of the velocity distribution function. Closure of the moment equations is challenging for flows sufficiently far away from the Maxwellian limit. In previous work, a quadrature-based third-order moment closure was derived for approximating solutions to the kinetic equation for arbitrary Knudsen number. A key component of quadrature-based closures is the moment-inversion algorithm used to find the non-negative weights and velocity abscissas. Here, a robust inversion procedure is proposed for three-component velocity moments up to ninth order. By reconstructing the velocity distribution function, the spatial fluxes in the moment equations are treated using a kinetic-based finite-volume solver. Because the quadrature-based moment method employs the moment transport equations directly instead of a discretized form of the kinetic equation, the mass, momentum and energy are conserved for arbitrary Knudsen and Mach numbers. The computational algorithm is tested for the Riemann shock problem and, for increasing Knudsen numbers (i.e. larger deviations from the Maxwellian limit), the accuracy of the moment closure is shown to be determined by the discrete representation of the spatial fluxes.},

The large range of length scales and timescales in turbulent multiphase flows makes direct numerical simulation of the microscale governing equations intractable for many applications. In this article we review a systematic approach for developing large-eddy-simulation (LES) tools for dispersed multiphase flows starting from the microscale model. A key intermediate step is the mesoscopic model for the dispersed phase, formulated in terms of kinetic equations, that contains the physical models for the flow. Owing to the phase-space variables, direct solution of the mesoscopic model is usually intractable, and additional mathematical approximations are introduced to arrive at a macroscopic model. We show that self-conditioned LES models can be derived for both the mesoscopic and macroscopic models, but the former is preferred to ensure consistency and physical accuracy. The principal difficulties and open challenges in closing the LES model equations are highlighted.},

  abstract = {The scope of the present study is Eulerian modeling and simulation of polydisperse liquid sprays undergoing droplet coalescence and evaporation. The fundamental mathematical description is the Williams spray equation governing the joint number density function f(v,u;x,t) of droplet volume and velocity. Eulerian multi-fluid models have already been rigorously derived from this equation in Laurent et al. [F. Laurent, M. Massot, P. Villedieu, Eulerian multi-fluid modeling for the numerical simulation of coalescence in polydisperse dense liquid sprays, J. Comput. Phys. 194 (2004) 505\textendash 543]. The first key feature of the paper is the application of direct quadrature method of moments (DQMOM) introduced by Marchisio and Fox [D.L. Marchisio, R.O. Fox, Solution of population balance equations using the direct quadrature method of moments, J. Aerosol Sci. 36 (2005) 43\textendash 73] to the Williams spray equation. Both the multi-fluid method and DQMOM yield systems of Eulerian conservation equations with complicated interaction terms representing coalescence. In order to focus on the difficulties associated with treating size-dependent coalescence and to avoid numerical uncertainty issues associated with two-way coupling, only one-way coupling between the droplets and a given gas velocity field is considered. In order to validate and compare these approaches, the chosen configuration is a self-similar 2D axisymmetrical decelerating nozzle with sprays having various size distributions, ranging from smooth ones up to Dirac delta functions. The second key feature of the paper is a thorough comparison of the two approaches for various test-cases to a reference solution obtained through a classical stochastic Lagrangian solver. Both Eulerian models prove to describe adequately spray coalescence and yield a very interesting alternative to the Lagrangian solver. The third key point of the study is a detailed description of the limitations associated with each method, thus giving criteria for their use as well as for their respective efficiency.},

  abstract = {This textbook presents a modern account of turbulence, one of the greatest challenges in physics. The state-of-the-art is put into historical perspective five centuries after the first studies of Leonardo and half a century after the first attempt by AN Kolmogorov to predict the properties of flow at very high Reynolds numbers. Such" fully developed turbulence" is ubiquitous in both cosmical and natural environments, in engineering applications and in everyday life. First, a qualitative introduction is given to bring out the need for a probabilistic description of what is in essence a deterministic system. Kolmogorov's 1941 theory is presented in a novel fashion with emphasis on symmetries (including scaling transformations) which are broken by the mechanisms producing the turbulence and restored by the chaotic character of the cascade to small scales. Considerable material is devoted to intermittency, the clumpiness of small-scale activity, which has led to the development of fractal and multifractal models. Such models, pioneered by B. Mandelbrot, have applications in numerous fields besides turbulence (diffusion limited aggregation, solid-earth geophysics, attractors of dynamical systems, etc). The final chapter contains an introduction to analytic theories of the sort pioneered by R. Kraichnan, to the modern theory of eddy transport and renormalization and to recent developments in the statistical theory of two-dimensional turbulence. The book concludes with a guide to further reading. The intended readership for the book ranges from first-year graduate students in mathematics, physics, astrophysics, geosciences and engineering, to professional \ldots},

The proposed numerical method is based on the consistent advection of conservative quantities and the advection of the color function used in the Volume of Fluid method avoiding any numerical diffusion of mass, momentum and energy across the interface during the advection step. The influence of surface tension and liquid compressibility on the dynamic response of the bubbles is discussed by comparing the full 3D solution with the predictions provided by the Rayleigh\textendash Plesset equation for two relevant problems related to the dynamic response of bubbles to pressure disturbances: The linear oscillation of a single bubble in an acoustic field and the Rayleigh collapse problem. Finally, the problem of the collapse of a bubble close to a wall is compared with experimental results showing the robustness of the method to simulate the collapse of air bubbles in liquids in problems where bubbles generate a high velocity liquid jet.},

The simulations of the atomization of a liquid sheet, the capillary retraction of a liquid sheet and two- and three-dimensional wave breaking all for air/water systems are used to show the potential of the numerical techniques. New simulations of atomization processes for air/water conditions are allowing us to investigate the processes leading to the appearance of instabilities in the primary atomization zone in real conditions. For the retracting liquid sheet, the new simulations show that two different regimes can be encountered as a function of the Ohnesorge number. For large values, a laminar flow is encountered inside the rim and a steady state is reached after a quick transient state. For small values, a turbulent flow is generated inside the rim, which is responsible for large oscillations in the rim size and neck thickness. The breaking wave case study demonstrates the orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains of the AMR method.},

However, traditional 2-D video observations cannot measure volcanic ejecta motion toward and away from the camera, strongly hindering our capability to fully determine crucial hazard-related parameters such as explosion directionality and pyroclasts' absolute velocity. In this paper, we use up to three synchronized high-speed cameras to reconstruct pyroclasts trajectories in three dimensions. Classical stereographic techniques are adapted to overcome the difficult observation conditions of active volcanic vents, including the large number of overlapping pyroclasts which may change shape in flight, variable lighting and clouding conditions, and lack of direct access to the target. In particular, we use a laser rangefinder to measure the geometry of the filming setup and manually track pyroclasts on the videos. This method reduces uncertainties to 108 in azimuth and dip angle of the pyroclasts, and down to 20\% in the absolute velocity estimation. We demonstrate the potential of this approach by three examples: the development of an explosion at Stromboli, a bubble burst at Halema'uma'u lava lake, and an in-flight collision between two bombs at Stromboli.},

The phenomenon of external intermittency in turbulent jet flames originates from a very thin layer, known as turbulent/non-turbulent interface, that separates the inner turbulent core from the outer irrotational surrounding fluid. The impact of external intermittency on turbulence is evaluated across the jet flame by the self-similarity scaling of higher-order structure functions of the mixture fraction. It is shown that the scaling of structure functions exhibits a growing departure from the prediction of classical scaling laws toward the edge of the flame. Empirical evidence is provided that this departure is primarily due to external intermittency and the associated break down of self-similarity. External intermittency creates local gradients that are significantly more intense compared to those created by internal intermittency alone. As chemical reactions usually take place in thin layers in the vicinity of the turbulent/non-turbulent interface, an accurate statistical description of these intense events is necessary to predict the turbulence-chemistry interaction. The study is based on data from a highly-resolved direct numerical simulation of a temporally evolving planar jet flame.},

In turbulent jet flows, the phenomenon of external intermittency originates from a sharp layer, known as the turbulent/non-turbulent interface, that separates the turbulent core from the surrounding irrotational fluid. First, it is shown that low-order and higher-order structure functions in both the core and the shear layer of the jet satisfy complete self-preservation, which means that structure functions are invariant with time and collapse over the entire range of scales, regardless of the set of length and velocity scales used for normalization. Next, the impact of external intermittency on small-scale turbulence is studied along the cross-wise direction by the self-similarity of structure functions. It is shown that structure functions exhibit from the centre toward the edge of the flow a growing departure from self-similarity and the prediction of classical scaling theories. By analysing statistics conditioned on the turbulent portion of the jet, it is demonstrated that this departure is primarily due to external intermittency and the associated similarity-breaking effect.},

High-resolution microscopy of the two-phase flows under 15 flow conditions (cases of different flow rates of the liquid and co-flowing air streams as well as different degrees of liquid preheating) reveal that the geometrical complexities evolve under the competing/combined action of the instability mechanisms such as Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz, Rayleigh\textendash Taylor and Rayleigh\textendash Plateau leading into the transition from break-up to atomization. A thorough analysis of the higher order moments of statistics evaluated based on the probability density functions from 15,000 fractal dimension samples suggest that a single-value analysis is not sufficient to describe the complex reshaping mechanisms in two-phase flows. Consistently positive skewness of the statistics reveal the role of abrupt two-phase mechanisms such as liquid column rupture, ligament disintegration, liquid sheet bursting and droplet distortions in a hierarchical geometrical entanglement. Further, large kurtosis values at increased flow inertia are found associated with turbulence-induced intermittent geometrical reshaping. Interestingly, the proposed power-law correlation reveals that the global droplet size obtained from laser-diffraction measurements declines as the two-phase geometrical complexity increases.},

Pesticides contaminate the atmosphere through various pathways. This paper discusses techniques for measuring and modelling pesticide emission, and the factors that affect drift processes during spray application. Chemical analyses allow the concentration of polluting agents in the air to be measured, and different methods have been developed for measuring diverse pesticide groups. Several air-sampling methods, which give different results depending on the amount of air collected, are reported. The use of various tracers, such as fluorescent dyes, is widely reported. Brilliant sulphoflavine is the best fluorescent dye due to its low degradation in sunlight. Various collector devices are used, the most common being 2mm diameter polymer lines. Although the report indicates a good level of collection efficiency, a complete understanding of the adhesion phenomenon is necessary. The use of mathematical and computational models to determine pesticide transport simplifies test and field evaluation. However, a detailed characterization of the agricultural environment, with temporal and spatial variations, is still necessary. The most common models are limited to transport and deposition of pesticides in the liquid phase to areas adjacent to treated fields. Drifting spray is a complex problem in which equipment design and application parameters, spray physical properties and formulation, and meteorological conditions interact and influence pesticide loss.},

One distribution is heuristic and another one is based on the linear-eddy model. Predictions from these distributions are tested with numerical simulations in which the unresolved droplet-mass production is closed by assuming that turbulence is the rate controlling mechanism and by using a correction step. Moreover, the testing considers a round jet with a Reynolds number of 5000 from which DNS data is available. Overall, it is found that the present atomization model provides an enhancement of accuracy of the droplet-mass production and droplet-diameter distribution in comparison with using no model. Furthermore, the predicted droplet-diameter distribution is more accurate than that using a previous assumption of taking droplet diameters equal to local Taylor microscales. These results are obtained with simulations whose cost is orders of magnitude less than DNS.},

  abstract = {The coagulation and sedimentation of particles is central to many environmental and industrial processes. Kinetic descriptions of this process can be divided into two approaches. Population balance equation (PBE) theory accounts for mass transfer between particle size classes by coagulation and loss of particle mass by sedimentation. Its practical application is limited by the fact that the rate constants, or kernels, for coagulation between all combinations of cluster sizes are unknown, and only a few solutions are available for simplified forms of the coagulation kernel. A second approach involves the use of simple rate expressions for the loss of particle mass with time, where the order of the reaction is determined by the mathematical properties of the coagulation kernel and the sedimentation term. Two different theories (similarity theory, ST, and the quasi-steady-state hypothesis, QSSH) give conflicting estimates for the order of the reaction. In this paper, we derive a PBE solution for the choice of a constant kernel and a particle removal rate that increases linearly with cluster volume. The kinetics of mass removal predicted by this solution are then compared directly to generalized forms of ST and QSSH which we also derive. We find that the PBE solution does not rigorously conform to either ST or QSSH, although the predictions of ST may be close enough for practical applications. This paper presents the first rigorous comparison of PBE, ST, and QSSH descriptions of particle coagulation and sedimentation.},

  abstract = {Masses erupted during normal explosions at Stromboli volcano (Italy) are notoriously difficult to measure. We present a method that uses thermal infrared video for cooling bomb fields to obtain the total power emitted by all hot particles emitted during an explosion. A given mass of magma (M) will emit a finite amount of thermal power, defined by M cp(Te \`A T0), cp and Te being magma specific heat capacity and temperature, and T0 being ambient temperature. We use this relation to convert the total power emitted by the bomb field to the mass required to generate that power. To do this we extract power flux curves for the field and integrate this through time to obtain total power (E). This is used to estimate mass (Q) in Q {$\frac{1}{4}$} E/cp(Te \`A T0). When applied to individual bombs we obtain masses of between 1 and 9 kg per bomb, or a volume of 970 and 6500 cm3. These volumes equate to spheres with diameters 12 and 27 cm. For the entire bomb field we obtain volumes of 7\textendash 28 m3. We calculate masses for 32 eruptions and obtain typical bomb masses of between 103 and 104 kg per eruption. In addition, we estimate that between 102 and 103 kg of gas and ash are emitted as part of a mixed plume of bombs, gas and ash. We identify two types of eruption on the basis of the erupted bomb masses and the ratio of the plume's gas-and-ash component to the bomb component. The first type is bomb-dominated, is characterized by bomb masses of 104 kg and has ash\textendash gas/ bomb ratios of \$ 0.02. The second type is ash-and-gas dominated, is characterized by erupted bomb masses of 103 kg and has ash\textendash gas/bomb ratios of around one, and as high as two. There is no correlation between the quantity of bombs and quantity of gas\textendash ash erupted. In addition, while source pressure for each explosion correlates with the quantity of gas and ash erupted, the mass of bombs emitted varies independently of pressure.},

  abstract = {The local flow topology analysis of the primary atomization of liquid jets has been conducted using the invariants of the velocity-gradient tensor. All possible small-scale flow structures are categorized into two focal and two nodal topologies for incompressible flows in both liquid and gaseous phases. The underlying direct numerical simulation database was generated by the one-fluid formulation of the two-phase flow governing equations including a high-fidelity volume-of-fluid method for accurate interface propagation. The ratio of liquid-to-gas fluid properties corresponds to a diesel jet exhausting into air. Variation of the inflow-based Reynolds number as well as Weber number showed that both these non-dimensional numbers play a pivotal role in determining the nature of the jet break-up, but the flow topology behaviour appears to be dominated by the Reynolds number. Furthermore, the flow dynamics in the gaseous phase is generally less homogeneous than in the liquid phase because some flow regions resemble a laminar-to-turbulent transition state rather than fully developed turbulence. Two theoretical models are proposed to estimate the topology volume fractions and to describe the size distribution of the flow structures, respectively. In the latter case, a simple power law seems to be a reasonable approximation of the measured topology spectrum. According to that observation, only the integral turbulent length scale would be required as an input for the a priori prediction of the topology size spectrum.},

We show that, e.g., in standard cases of slow, exponential equilibration, (at least) one of these assumptions is not valid. This demonstration highlights the difficulty to judge the validity of the above assumptions without further information. Such information is, in general, very hard to obtain.},

In this review we give a systematic report on the relevant physical properties of agricultural spray liquids and how these influence spray characteristics. According to the data reported in literature, it can be concluded that not only spray-mix additives but also certain formulation types can be used to reduce spray drift. To complete the picture, existing drift mitigation techniques and conditions have been reviewed along with measuring equipment which is commonly used to characterize agricultural sprays and the droplet size-related biological aspects of the application process. In a final step, we discuss the possibility of estimating drift risk based on the physicochemical properties of spray liquids induced by different formulation types.},

  abstract = {The splitting of globules is an important phenomenon during the final stages of disintegration processes. Three basic types of deformation of globules and six types of flow patterns causing them are distinguished. The forces controlling deformation and breakup comprise two dimensionless groups: a Weber group NWe and a viscosity group NVi. Breakup occurs when NWe exceeds a critical value (NWe)crit. Three cases are studied in greater detail: (a) Taylor's experiments on the breakup of a drop in simple types of viscous flow, (b) breakup of a drop in an air stream, (c) emulsification in a turbulent flow. It is shown that (NWe)crit depends on the type of deformation and on the flow pattern around the globule. For case (a) (NWe)crit shows a minimum value {$\sim$} 0.5 at a certain value of (NVi) and seems to increase indefinitely with either decreasing or increasing ratio between the viscosites of the two phases. For case (b) (NWe)crit varies between 13 and {$\infty$}, depending on NVi and on the way in which the relative air velocity varies with time, the lowest value refers to the true shock case and Nvi\textrightarrow 0. For case (c) (NWe)crit, which determines the maximum drop size in the emulsion, amounts to {$\sim$}1, and the corresponding values of NVi appear to be small. A formula is derived for the maximum drop size.},

It may recoil to one sphere, the geometrical shape with lowest surface, or otherwise segment to several pieces which individually will recoil to spheres. This experiment is classical and its exploration is fundamental to the understanding of how liquid volumes relax. In this paper, we uncover a mechanism involving the creation of a vortex ring which plays a central role in escaping segmentation. The retracting blob is connected to the untouched filament by a neck. The radius of the neck decreases in time such that we may expect pinch-off. There is a flow through the neck because of the retraction. This flow may detach into a jet downstream of the neck when fluid viscosity exceeds a threshold. This sudden detachment creates a vortex ring which strongly modifies the flow pressure: fluid is expelled back into the neck which in turn reopens.},

Various dispersed and continuous phase gases and liquids were considered to provide dispersed/continuous phase density ratios of 1.15\textendash 12,000, Ohnesorge numbers of 0.0006\textendash 600, Weber numbers of 0.004\textendash 700 and Reynolds numbers of 0.03\textendash 16,000. At low Ohnesorge numbers ({$<$}0.1) for all types of disturbances, significant drop deformation (5\%) began at Weber numbers of roughly unity, with the deformation regime ending due to the onset of breakup at Weber numbers of 10\textendash 20. These transitions were relatively unaffected by the Ohnesorge number for steady disturbances, however, increasing Ohnesorge numbers caused progressive increases of the Weber number range for both deformation and breakup regimes for shock wave disturbances\textemdash an effect that could be explained using phenomenological theory. Another transition, between dome- and bowl-shaped drops (related to the transition between bag and shear breakup), was correlated mainly in terms of Weber and Reynolds numbers for present conditions. Drop deformation for steady disturbances was relatively independent of dispersed/continuous phase density ratios but generally was smaller than for shock wave disturbances at comparable conditions due to the absence of overshoot from inertial effects. In contrast, drop drag coefficients, normalized by the drag coefficient of a solid sphere at the same Reynolds number, were correlated quite well by the degree of deformation alone.},

For intervals of particle size where only one coagulation mechanism is dominant, dimensional analysis predicts self-similar size distributions that contain only one dimensionless constant for each mechanism. Experiments were designed to test these predictions with clay particles in artificial seawater sheared in the gap between concentric rotating cylinders.

An adaptive, volume of fluid (VOF) method based on octree meshing is used, providing a notable reduction of computational cost. Results are presented in three main parts; droplet deformation and bag formation, bag breakup mechanism, and variations in the number and size of fragments. It is clearly shown that the droplet initially deforms into a thin hollow bag. After that, due to growth of instabilities over the thin liquid sheet, several punctures are formed. The holes further grow, generating a web of ligaments. In this stage, the fragmentation domain consists of a liquid torus left above the bag, a number of ligaments and droplets, and the parent droplet core. The liquid torus, the core, and the unstable ligaments disintegrate further. The breakup processes continue until the hydro-dynamic and the surface tension forces reach an equilibrium condition for each fragment. The growth of fragment numbers during the atomization stage is described and the size distributions between the simulations are compared. The analysis performed here precisely demonstrates the mechanism of the bag breakup and depicts an accurate history for the small fragments generated in the secondary atomization process. The outcomes can be used for development of the secondary atomization models. Moreover, the results can be directly used for better understanding of rain drop atomization during precipitation, as well as water droplet atomization in cooling towers.},

The surface wave dynamics, vortex dynamics and their interactions are explained. Understandings of liquid stream break up and concurrent smaller structure formation are built upon an examination of both translation and rotation of the fluid. In all cases, hole formation is correlated with hairpin and helical vortices; fluid motion through a perforation in the thin sheet near the wave crest corresponds to these vortices. The hole formation process is dominated by inertial forces rather than capillary action, which differs from mechanisms suggested previously for other configurations. Circulation due to streamwise vorticity increases while the lobes thin and holes form. For larger surface tension, cavities in the jet core rather than perforations in a sheet occur. The more rapid radial extension of the two-phase mixture with increasing gas density is explained by greater circulation in the ring (i.e. wave crest) region.

  abstract = {Outwardly-opening injectors for gasoline direct-injection engines generate hollow-cone sprays which have better atomization performance than conventional hole-type nozzle sprays. The ambient density alters the initial flow breakup and the downstream vortex structure of the hollow-cone sprays which in turn rearrange the local droplet size distribution. However, the ambient density effects on those spray properties have not been thoroughly characterized in the previous studies despite their crucial effects on engine combustion. The current study investigates the ambient density effects on the initial liquid-sheet breakup and local droplet size distribution of hollow-cone sprays from an outwardly-opening gasoline-direct-injection injector using X-ray and visible light imaging techniques. The ambient density effects were investigated in varied needle lift conditions which altered the initial flow conditions such as liquid-sheet thickness and turbulence. In general, an increase in the ambient density decreased the breakup length of the liquid-sheet but the effects became insignificant as the initial flow turbulence increased in high needle lift conditions. The spray droplet size in the near-nozzle region decreased with the increase in ambient density but a reverse trend was observed at downstream because the spray atomization was terminated faster at high ambient densities. Particularly large droplets were observed near the spray head due to the coalescence of liquid droplets accelerated by the vortex flow. The increase in ambient density brought this large droplet regime closer to the nozzle with the further increase in the droplet sizes.},

  abstract = {A droplet ejection mechanism in planar two-phase mixing layers is examined. Any disturbance on the gas-liquid interface grows into a Kelvin-Helmholtz wave and the wave crest forms a thin liquid film that flaps as the wave grows downstream. Increasing the gas speed, it is observed that the film breaks-up into droplets which are eventually thrown into the gas stream at large angles. In a flow where most of the momentum is in the horizontal direction, it is surprising to observe these large ejection angles. Our experiments and simulations show that a recirculation region grows downstream of the wave and leads to vortex shedding similar to the wake of a backward-facing step. The ejection mechanism results from the interaction between the liquid film and the vortex shedding sequence: a recirculation zone appears in the wake of the wave and a liquid film emerges from the wave crest; the recirculation region detaches into a vortex and the gas flow over the wave momentarily reattaches due to the departure of the vortex; this reattached flow pushes the liquid film down; by now, a new recirculation vortex is being created in the wake of the wave\textemdash just where the liquid film is now located; the liquid film is blown-up from below by the newly formed recirculation vortex in a manner similar to a bag-breakup event; the resulting droplets are catapulted by the recirculation vortex.},

In traditional computational fluid dynamics (CFD) based on Reynolds-averaged Navier\textendash Stokes (RANS) approach, physical modelling of atomization and sprays is an essential part of the two-phase flow computation. In more advanced CFD such as direct numerical simulation (DNS) and large-eddy simulation (LES), physical modelling of atomization and sprays is still inevitable. For multiphase flows, there is no model-free DNS since the interactions between different phases need to be modelled. DNS of multiphase flows based on the one-fluid formalism coupled with interface tracking algorithms seems to be a promising way forward, due to the advantageous lower costs compared with a multi-fluid approach. In LES of gas\textendash liquid two-phase jet flows, subgrid-scale (SGS) models for complex multiphase flows are very immature. There is a lack of well-established SGS models to account for the interactions between the different phases. In this paper, physical modelling of atomization and sprays in the context of CFD is reviewed with modelling assumptions and limitations discussed. In addition, numerical methods used in advanced CFD of atomization and sprays are discussed, including high-order numerical schemes. Other relevant issues of modelling and simulation of atomization and sprays such as nozzle internal flow, dense spray, and multiscale modelling are also briefly reviewed.},

  abstract = {Fuel atomization which begins with turbulence perturbation has a significant influence on engine performance. The effect of turbulence on near nozzle field characteristics under various liquid-gas density ratios is performed in present models. First, using three-dimensional DNS (3-D Direct Numerical Simulation) method, a time-varying single-phase fully developed turbulent pipe flow is generated to store time-varying outlet velocity databases which are then mapped as the two-phase jet inlet velocities. After that, the characteristics of near nozzle diesel jet evolution are studied by solving the two-phase turbulent flows and tracking the two-phase interfaces based on DNS and VOF (Volume of Fluid) methods. It shows that with fully developed turbulent inject velocities, the topology of the jet evolves gradually from violent wavy surface, ligaments, to droplet parcels with different dimensions and shapes, which are considered more realistic and different from uniform/sinusoidal perturbation inject velocities, especially in the near nozzle field. Jets surface distortion, stretched and sheared interface are captured. Three different separation processes in different downstream positions are detected. In the initial stage of the jet, long and narrow ligaments act as primary breakup. In the later stage, the whole breakup process evolves more disorderly and more intensively, so that flat and curly ligaments are observed. Also, higher gas densities and narrower nozzle sizes can accelerate the jet break-up process. Furthermore, the present work is reasonably compared with experimental and numerical modeling results.},

An attempt is made to relate the two main streams of research in this area: the multifractal description and the coherent filaments identified in numerical simulations. It is concluded that, although both approaches can be expressed in a common language, they are inconsistent in detail and both are incomplete. While the multifractal approach is a kinematic description without dynamics, the present understanding of the scaling and dynamics of the coherent vortices requires the existence of stable laminar structures of arbitrarily large Reynolds numbers, and probably represents only one of a hierarchy of intermittent objects. It is suggested that the vortices may not survive at very high values of Re{$\lambda$}, and that the problem extends to all the intermittent structures of turbulence. It is shown that the filaments should dominate the structure functions in a range of scales that goes from beyond the Kolmogorov scale for p {$<$} 4 to the whole inertial range if the scaling exponent {$\zeta$}p \textrightarrow{} {$\infty$} (usually expected as p \textrightarrow{} {$\infty$}.)},

  abstract = {When a turbulent flow in a porous medium is determined numerically, the crucial question is whether turbulence models should account only for turbulent structures restricted in size to the pore scale or whether the size of turbulent structures could exceed the pore scale. The latter would mean the existence of macroscopic turbulence in porous media, when turbulent eddies exceed the pore size. In order to determine the real size of turbulent structures in a porous medium, we simulated the turbulent flow by direct numerical simulation (DNS) calculations, thus avoiding turbulence modelling of any kind. With this study, which for the first time uses DNS calculations, we provide benchmark data for turbulent flow in porous media. Since perfect DNS calculations require the resolution of scales down to the Kolmogorov scale, often only approximate DNS solutions can be obtained, especially for high Reynolds numbers. This is accounted for by using and comparing two different DNS approaches, a finite volume method (FVM) with grid refinement towards the wall and a lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) with equal grid distribution. The solid matrix was simulated by a large number of rectangular bars arranged periodically. The number of bars in the solution domain with periodic boundary conditions was reduced systematically until a minimum size was found that does not suppress any large-scale turbulent structures. Two-point correlations, integral length scales and energy spectra were determined in order to answer the question of whether or not macroscopic turbulence can be found in porous media.},

The sprinkler with optimal geometry (the OFS sprinkler) capable to generate foam with expansion rate K of 13.6 was developed. In this work, the OFS sprinkler was tested under conditions close to a real fire. The comparison of the extinguishing efficiency of the OFS sprinkler with three deflector type sprinklers widely used in automatic foam extinguishing systems is presented. Fire extinguishing efficiency of the tested sprinklers was compared by using the extinguishing efficiency indicator Et, which takes into account the extinguishing time of the model fire site and specific discharge of the extinguishing agent. It was found that the fire extinguishing efficiency of the OFS sprinkler is more than 2.5 times better compared with the other tested sprinklers.},

In recent years, however, vehicle aerodynamics gained increased attention, mainly due to the utilization of the negative lift (downforce) principle, yielding several important performance improvements. This review briefly explains the significance of the aerodynamic downforce and how it improves race car performance. After this short introduction various methods to generate downforce such as inverted wings, diffusers, and vortex generators are discussed. Due to the complex geometry of these vehicles, the aerodynamic interaction between the various body components is significant, resulting in vortex flows and lifting surface shapes unlike traditional airplane wings. Typical design tools such as wind tunnel testing, computational fluid dynamics, and track testing, and their relevance to race car development, are discussed as well. In spite of the tremendous progress of these design tools (due to better instrumentation, communication, and computational power), the fluid dynamic phenomenon is still highly nonlinear, and predicting the effect of a particular modification is not always trouble free. Several examples covering a wide range of vehicle shapes (e.g., from stock cars to open-wheel race cars) are presented to demonstrate this nonlinear nature of the flow field.},

The numerical predictions to be presented were performed for a planar model atomizer, for which a vast amount of experimental data was collected by us previously.

The aim of this paper is to give a fairly general scheme of the random process of particle grinding, for which in the limit (when grinding does not stop) the Gauss law for the logarithms of particle sizes can be established theoretically. Perhaps similar considerations will help to explain also why the Gauss distribution is applicable to the logarithms of mineral contents in separate samples (Razumovskii's paper is mainly devoted to this question).},

  abstract = {Consistency and uniqueness questions raised by both the 1941 and 1962 Kolmogorov inertial-range theories are examined. The 1941 theory, although unlikely from the viewpoint of vortex-stretching physics, is not ruled out just because the dissipation fluctuates; but self-consistency requires that dissipation fluctuations be confined to dissipation-range scales by a spacewise mixing mechanism. The basic idea of the 1962 theory is a self-similar cascade mechanism which produces systematically increasing intermittency with a decrease of scale size. This concept in itself requires neither the third Kolmogorov hypothesis (log-normality of locally averaged dissipation) nor the first hypothesis (universality of small-scale statistics as functions of scale-size ratios and locally averaged dissipation). It does not even imply that the inertial range exhibits power laws. A central role for dissipation seems arbitrary since conservation alone yields no simple relation between the local dissipation rate and the corresponding proper inertial-range quantity: the local rate of energy transfer. A model rate equation for the evolution of probability densities is used to illustrate that even scalar nonlinear cascade processes need not yield asymptotic log-normality. The approximate experimental support for Kolmogorov's hypothesis takes on added significance in view of the wide variety of a priori admissible alternatives.If the Kolmogorov law E(k){$\propto$}k-53-{$\mu$}E(k) \textbackslash propto k\^\{-\textbackslash frac\{5\}\{3\}-\textbackslash mu\} is asymptotically valid, it is argued that the value of {$\mu$} depends on the details of the nonlinear interaction embodied in the Navier\textendash Stokes equation and cannot be deduced from overall symmetries, invariances and dimensionality. A dynamical equation is exhibited which has the same essential invariances, symmetries, dimensionality and equilibrium statistical ensembles as the Navier\textendash Stokes equation but which has radically different inertial-range behaviour.},

  abstract = {The impact of ocean spray on the dynamics of the marine near-surface air boundary layer (MABL) in conditions of very high (hurricane) wind speeds is investigated. Toward this end, a model of the MABL in the presence of sea-spume droplets is developed. The model is based on the classical theory of the motion of suspended particles in a turbulent flow, where the mass concentration of droplets is not mandatory small. Description of the spume-droplet generation assumes that they, being torn off from breaking waves, are injected in the form of a jet of spray into the airflow at the altitude of breaking wave crests. The droplets affect the boundary-layer dynamics in two ways: via the direct impact of droplets on the airflow momentum forming the so-called spray force, and via the impact of droplets on the turbulent mixing through stratification. The latter is parametrized applying the Monin\textendash Obukhov similarity theory. It is found that the dominant impact of droplets on the MABL dynamics appears through the action of the `spray force' originated from the interaction of the `rain of spray' with the wind velocity shear, while the efficiency of the stratification mechanism is weaker. The effect of spray leads to an increase in the wind velocity and suppression of the turbulent wind stress in the MABL. The key issue of the model is a proper description of the spume-droplet generation. It is shown that, after the spume-droplet generation is fitted to the observations, the MABL model is capable of reproducing the fundamental experimental finding\textemdash the suppression of the surface drag at very high wind speeds. We found that, at very high wind speeds, a thin part of the surface layer adjacent to the surface turns into regime of limited saturation with the spume droplets, resulting in the levelling off of the friction velocity and decrease of the drag coefficient as \$\$\{U\_\{10\}\^\{-2\}, U\_\{10\}\}\$\$ being the wind speed at 10-m height.},

  abstract = {There is a large amount of experimental and numerical work dealing with dry granular flows (such as sand, glass beads etc.) that supports the so called \textmu (I)- rheology. The reliability of the \textmu (I)-rheology in the case of complex transient flows is not fully ascertained, however. In this perspective, the granular column collapse experiment provides an interesting benchmark. In this paper we implement the \textmu (I)-rheology in a Navier\textendash Stokes solver (Gerris) and compare the resulting solutions with both analytical solutions and two-dimensional contact dynamics discrete simulations. In a first series of simulations, we check the numerical model in the case of a steady infinite bi-dimensional granular layer avalanching on an inclined plane. A second layer of Newtonian fluid is then added over the granular layer in order to recover a close approximation of a free-surface condition. Comparisons with analytical and semi-analytical solutions provide a conclusive validation of the numerical implementation of the \textmu (I)-rheology. In a second part, we simulate the unsteady two-dimensional collapse of granular columns over a wide range of aspect ratios. Systematic comparisons with discrete two-dimensional contact dynamics simulations show good agreement between the two methods for the inner deformations and the time evolution of the shape during most of the flow, while a systematic underestimation of the final run-out is observed. The experimental scalings of spreading of the column as a function of the aspect ratio available from the literature are also recovered. A discussion follows on the performances of other rheologies, and on the sensitivity of the simulations to the parameters of the \textmu (I)-rheology.},

Visualization of the jet's near field and measurements of the frequencies associated with the gas\textendash liquid interfacial instabilities are used to study the underlying physical mechanisms involved in the primary break-up of the water jet. This process is shown to consist of the stripping of water sheets, or ligaments, which subsequently break into smaller lumps or drops. An entrainment model of the near-field stripping of the liquid is proposed, and shown to describe the measured liquid shedding frequencies. This simplified model explains qualitatively the dependence of the shedding frequency on the air/water momentum ratio in both initially laminar and turbulent water jets. The role of the secondary liquid break-up in the far-field atomization of the water jet is also investigated, and an attempt is made to apply the classical concepts of local isotropy to explain qualitatively the measurement of the far-field droplet size distribution and its dependence on the water to air mass and momentum ratios. Models accounting for the effect of the local turbulent dissipation rate in the gas on both the break-up and coalescence of the droplets are developed and compared with the measurements of the variation of the droplet size along the jet's centreline. The total flux of kinetic energy supplied by the gas per unit total mass of the spray jet was found to be the primary parameter determining the secondary break-up and coalescence of the droplets in the far field.},

We explore the system behavior as a function of the particle volume fraction and the Reynolds number (the ratio of flow and particle inertia to viscous forces). Unlike single-phase flows, where a clear distinction exists between the laminar and the turbulent states, three different regimes can be identified in the presence of a particulate phase, with smooth transitions between them. At low volume fractions, the flow becomes turbulent when increasing the Reynolds number, transitioning from the laminar regime dominated by viscous forces to the turbulent regime characterized by enhanced momentum transport by turbulent eddies. At larger volume fractions, we identify a new regime characterized by an even larger increase of the wall friction. The wall friction increases with the Reynolds number (inertial effects) while the turbulent transport is weakly affected, as in a state of intense inertial shear thickening. This state may prevent the transition to a fully turbulent regime at arbitrary high speed of the flow.},

  abstract = {This work deals with numerical simulations of atomization with high Weber and Reynolds values. A special attention has been devoted to the modelling of primary break-up. Due to progress of direct numerical simulations (DNS) of two phase flows it is now possible to simulate the primary break-up of a Diesel spray [Menard, T., Tanguy, S., Berlemont, A., 2007. Coupling level set/VOF/ghost fluid methods: validation and application to 3D simulation of the primary break-up of a liquid jet. Int. J. Multiphase Flow 33 (5), 510\textendash 524]. The present formulation of the so-called ELSA (Eulerian\textendash Lagrangian Spray Atomization model) [Vallet, A., Borghi, R., 1999. Mod\'elisation Eulerienne de L'atomisation d'un Jet Liquide. C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris S\'er. II b 327, 1015\textendash 1020] for atomization is presented and evaluated in the dense zone of the spray by comparison to a DNS based on a coupled level set/VOF/ghost fluid method. Once constants and parameters of the model are fixed thanks to comparisons with DNS, the model is tested with experimental data. The liquid and vapour penetrations show a good agreement when they are compared to experiments of Diesel atomization. In particular the influence of the gas temperature is well recovered. For different temperatures, similarly to the experiments, vapour penetrations are unchanged, but the corresponding equivalent ratio fields are strongly modified. Finally, the combustion model ECFM-3Z [Colin, O., Benkenida, A., 2004. The 3-zones extended coherent flame model (ecfm-3z) for computing premixed/diffusion combustion. Oil Gas Sci. Technol. 59 (6) 593\textendash 609] is joined to the ELSA model and the effect of gas temperature changes on a Diesel spray flame is reproduced.},

  abstract = {Atomization of liquid fuel jets by cross-flowing airstream is critical to the performance of many aerospace combustors. Recent advances in numerical methods and increases in computational power have enabled the first principle, high fidelity simulation of this phenomenon. In the recent past we presented a detailed validation and analysis of such simulations against experimental data at ambient conditions. At combustor operating conditions, however, both temperature and pressure are significantly elevated. In this work we extend the same computational approach to the study of the impact of reduced liquid\textendash gas density ratio due to increased air density associated with operating pressure elevation on the atomization physics. The previously validated ambient condition case is used as the baseline for comparison with three cases with decreasing density ratios. The density ratio is independently varied by adjusting the gas density and velocity together so that the momentum flux ratio and Weber number are maintained constant. The global-scale jet penetration and trajectory are slightly modified as the density ratio varies. The most significant changes are observed for the local processes of liquid breakup and atomization. As the density ratio is independently reduced, a transition of dominance from the Rayleigh\textendash Taylor to the Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz instability mechanisms on the liquid column surface is detected by analyzing the vorticity fields. Such a transition is verified using linear stability analyses and is also shown to be consistent with the simulation results of a non-monotonic variation of surface wavelength with density ratio. Downstream, a counter-rotating vortex pair (CVP) arises as the density ratio is reduced, the physical origins of which are similar to those documented for gaseous jet in cross-flow studies. Atomization effectiveness is reduced downstream with reduced density ratio and this is in agreement with experimental observation. This result is explained in terms of the density-ratio-related velocity-ratio changes that allow for a switch in behavior from a faster to a slower crossflow speed with respect to the liquid. As a result, at low density ratio recoiling of stretched structures and possibility of increased collision result in increasing Sauter Mean Diameter (SMD).},

As the viscosity of biodiesel is much higher than that of standard diesel, the atomization characteristics of a biodiesel jet can significantly deviate from those of a standard diesel jet under identical injection conditions. Since atomization of the injected fuel has a strong impact on fuel-air mixing and the following combustion processes, it is important to investigate the atomization of biodiesel and in particular to understand how the fuel properties affect the atomization process and the resulting spray characteristics. In the present study, three-dimensional direct numerical simulations are conducted to investigate atomizing biodiesel and diesel jets. The novel adaptive multiphase solver Basilisk is used for simulations. The statistics of droplets formed in the biodiesel jet is compared to the diesel jet under identical injection conditions.},

Particular attention is focused on the momentum coupling between LPP and resolved flow and the conversion between droplets represented by VOF and LPP. A series of multiphase flow problems are considered to validate the model. The results obtained by a number of simulations are compared against direct numerical simulation (DNS) results and experimental data. In particular, the model is applied to simulate the gas-assisted atomization experiment, and the numerical results are compared to the experimental measurements for a quantitative validation.},

Here we propose a conservative method to deal with the diffusion of a tracer in VOF schemes when the diffusion is limited to one of the phases. The method consists in weighing the diffusivity with the value of the volume fraction computed from the analytically reconstructed interface. In this way, the interface is made impermeable to the tracer, which is conservatively kept within one of the phases. The performance of this method is first tested by comparing simple configurations with existing analytical solutions. In the cases when the diffusion, electroosmotic motion and hydrodynamic singularities compete, the results indicate that, after breakup, charges distribute between droplets differently from models assuming homogeneous and constant electrical conductivities (i.e. no electrokinetic effects). However, such departure does not alter the main hydrodynamic balances leading to well-established scaling laws of breakup.},

Thanks to some numerical simulations and new experimental visualizations, a discussion is proposed to analyze the successive steps of atomization of a plunging liquid jet when a wave break. The complexity of the phenomenon will be highlighted, while some possible instability mechanisms will be described. Following the plunging jet impact, vortex filaments are produced, inducing air entrainment and complex structures which can be similar to the so-called obliquely descending eddies.},

Early studies describe both the mechanical and thermodynamic effects focusing on the influence of the initial pressure and temperature on the spray characteristics. The resulting flashing jet usually emerges to the low-pressure region with a high velocity and fragments to large blobs and ligaments which break up to droplets due to both mechanical and thermodynamic effects. This present study describes a numerical approach for simulating the atomisation of flashing liquids suitable for both primary atomisation and secondary break-up using the Eulerian-Lagrangian-Spray-Atomisation model coupled with a pressure equation for the metastable jet. The proposed approach aims at describing the atomisation of superheated jets and the impact of bubble nucleation at different stages and regimes inside the channel the liquid emerges from. The changes in the regime outside the nozzle are discussed for various cases of flashing liquids providing insights for the interactions of the mechanisms that contribute to the liquid fragmentation and the spray characteristics such as the droplet size and velocity and the spray angle.},

  abstract = {In this paper we tackle a critical issue in the numerical modeling, by Eulerian moment methods, of polydisperse multiphase systems, constituted of dispersed particles or droplets, a general class of systems which include aerosols. Their modeling starts at a mesoscopic scale with an equation on the number density function NDF of particles/droplets which satisfies a population balance equation. (PBE, also called Williams equation in the spray community). In order to limit the computational cost, moment methods provide a system of conservation equation with an eventual closure problem which can be solved using quadrature methods in order to retrieve the unclosed terms from the considered set of moments. However, a drift velocity, that is, the rate of change due to continuous phenomena of the internal coordinate such as the size of the particles, has sometimes to be taken into account; it can be either positive like molecular growth, or negative such as for evaporation of droplets in aerosols or oxidation of soots. When negative, it leads to the disappearance of droplets/particles thus creating a negative flux at zero size. Its closure requires an evaluation of the reconstructed NDF at zero size from the knowledge of some moments. The nature of this information, pointwise in internal coordinate, and its influence on moment dynamics results in a difficulty from both a modeling and a numerical point of view. We obtain in the present contribution a comprehensive solution to this important issue. Since we introduce some new tools in order to resolve the flux evaluation, we also introduce a new Eulerian type of description which will combine both the flexibility of Eulerian models for which the size phase space is discretized into ``sections'' (i.e. size intervals) and the efficiency of Direct Quadrature Method of Moments (DQMOM). It yields a precise and stable description of moment dynamics with a minimal number of variables which should lead to a low computational cost in multi-dimensional configurations.},

  abstract = {Two different approaches for numerical simulations of primary break-up of liquid jet are described. In the ELSA model (Eulerian Lagrangian Spray Atomization) the liquid and the gas are considered as two species of a same mixture, but without necessarily the same velocity. The drift velocity and the liquid mass dispersion are exactly related to the turbulent liquid mass flux. To describe the topology of the spray the liquid/gas interface density per unit of volume is used instead of the droplet diameter that has no meaning in the dense part of the spray. To establish definitely the model for the turbulent liquid mass flux and for the liquid/gas interface density equation, DNS simulations are carried out to obtain information in the dense zone of the spray where nearly no experimental data are available. Interface tracking is ensured by the Level Set Method and the Ghost Fluid Method (GFM) is used to capture accurately sharp discontinuities for pressure, density and viscosity. Coupling between the Level Set and VOF method is used for mass conservation. Fluid motion is predicted with a projection method for incompressible flows.},

The DNS use a coupled level set volume of fluid (CLSVOF) sharp interface capturing method resolving all relevant scales to predict the drop size distribution (DSD) for drops larger than the grid spacing. The LES use a volume of fluid (VOF) diffused interface method modelling the sub grid droplets. The purpose of this paper is to provide a comparison of the results of drop data between DNS and LES. The simulations are performed for a liquid jet injection with liquid-gas momentum flux ratio of 6.6, liquid jet Reynolds number of 14,000 injected into a crossflowing air with Reynolds number 570,000 and Weber number of 330 at a liquid-to-gas density ratio of 10. Two distinct and simultaneous atomization/breakup mechanisms have been observed in the simulations: column/bag breakup and ligament/surface breakup. It was found that the DSDs obtained from the DNS and LES each follow a log-normal distribution based on their respective droplet diameter data. An overlap region exists between the individual DSDs from the DNS and LES when combined. The width of this overlap region decreases along the downstream direction. A log-normal distribution is found to be a good fit to the combined DSD incorporating both resolved and sub-grid droplets. This information is relevant for the secondary atomization simulations and modeling.},

  abstract = {Despite recent advances in numerical methods for multiphase flows, the complete simulation of a liquid spray is still an illusive goal. There are few models that can describe accurately both the primary and secondary atomization simultaneously. The biggest difficulty is the wide range of length scales involved; from millimetres in the largest liquid structures close to the smallest micron-size droplets. This wide range makes Direct Numerical Simulation of sprays very expensive all scales need to be resolved and expensive algorithms are required to reconstruct accurately the interface. Large eddy simulations are becoming increasingly popular in turbulent flows due to their better description of turbulence and the relative robustness of sub-grid stress models. Despite its advantages, large eddy simulation cannot describe accurately fluid structures that occur at sub-grid levels. This paper presents a new model to describe the atomization process. The method consist of solving a joint sub-grid probability density function of liquid volume and surface using stochastic methods. The approach can simulate both dense and dilute regions of the spray. The proposed model can determine instantaneous sub-grid liquid structures (droplets) distributions as well as to capture the primary break-up. The results of the simulations are compared to a Direct Numerical Simulation of a Diesel Jet break-up. The mean liquid volume and surface density are well predicted; The modelling of the sub-grid scales is shown to be fundamental in the dilute regions of the spray.},

Dynamo thresholds are obtained for various magnetic permeabilities of the impellers and it is observed that the threshold decreases as the magnetic permeability increases. Hydrodynamic results compare well with experimental data in the same range of kinetic Reynolds numbers: at small impeller rotation frequency, the flow is steady; at larger frequency, the fluctuating flow is characterized by small scales and helical vortices localized between the blades. MHD computations show that two distinct magnetic families compete at small kinetic Reynolds number and these two families merge at larger kinetic Reynolds number. In both cases, using ferromagnetic material for the impellers decreases the dynamo threshold and enhances the axisymmetric component of the magnetic field: the resulting dynamo is a mostly axisymmetric axial dipole with an azimuthal component concentrated in the impellers as observed in the VKS experiment.},

  abstract = {Contraction of a filament of an incompressible Newtonian liquid in a passive ambient fluid is studied computationally to provide insights into the dynamics of satellite drops created during drop formation. This free boundary problem, which is composed of the Navier\textendash Stokes system and the associated initial and boundary conditions that govern the evolution in time of the filament shape and the velocity and pressure fields within it, is solved by the method of lines incorporating the finite element method for spatial discretization. The finite element algorithm developed here utilizes an adaptive elliptic mesh generation technique that is capable of tracking the dynamics of the filament up to the incipience of pinch-off without the use of remeshing. The correctness of the algorithm is verified by demonstrating that its predictions accord with (a) previously published results of Basaran (1992) on the analysis of finite-amplitude oscillations of viscous drops, (b) simulations of the dynamics of contracting filaments carried out with the well-benchmarked algorithm of Wilkes et al. (1999), and (c) scaling laws governing interface rupture and transitions that can occur from one scaling law to another as pinch-off is approached. In dimensionless form, just two parameters govern the problem: the dimensionless half-length \$L\_o\$ and the Ohnesorge number \$Oh\$ which measures the relative importance of viscous force to capillary force. Regions of the parameter space are identified where filaments (a) contract to a sphere without breaking into multiple droplets, (b) break via the so-called endpinching mechanism where daughter drops pinch-off from the ends of the main filament, and (c) break after undergoing a series of complex oscillations. Predictions made with the new algorithm are also compared to those made with a model based on the slender-jet approximation. A region of the parameter space is found where the slender-jet approximation fares poorly, and its cause is elucidated by examination of the vorticity dynamics and flow fields within contracting filaments.},

  abstract = {Aerodynamic breakup (aerobreakup) consist on the decomposition of liquid bulks into smaller droplets due to the effect of a gas stream. Depending on the flow parameters, a liquid drop affected by a gas stream can evolve in several aerobreakup modes [1, 2]. In particular, bag mode breakup takes place at moderate to low gas Weber numbers. During this process, the drops deforms into a film with a bag shape. As the bag radius increases, the film thickness decreases until a hole forms and expands, bursting the bag into a spray. This mechanism is present in several breakup scenarios and it is of great interest to understand the underlying physics of liquid atomization. In this work, we present numerical simulations of a single droplet submerged in a stream with sets of parameters corresponding to bag mode breakup regime. We solve Navier-Stokes equations for the two-phase flow using a Volume of Fluid (VOF) method with a Piecewise Linear Interface Capturing (PLIC) and geometrical advection schemes on the volume fraction and momentum equations. We also apply Adaptive Mesh Re- finement (AMR) to reduce the computational cost, using high mesh resolution only in the region of interest. These tools are programmed in the Basilisk open-source suite (http://basilisk.fr/)[3]. The deformation of the drop into a film and the posterior evolu- tion of its thickness is studied until the formation of a hole.},

Moreover, asymmetry in the financial data is rarely modeled in a systematic way. In this paper, we suggest a general density function based on the maximum entropy (ME) approach that takes account of asymmetry, excess kurtosis and also of high peakedness. The ME principle is based on the efficient use of available information, and as is well known, many of the standard family of distributions can be derived from the ME approach. We demonstrate how we can extract information functional from the data in the form of moment functions. We also propose a test procedure for selecting appropriate moment functions. Our procedure is illustrated with an application to the NYSE stock returns. The empirical results reveal that the ME approach with a fewer moment functions leads to a model that captures the stylized facts quite effectively.},

The algorithm is implemented in a general structure to allow the addition of other kernel density functions defined on R+, and arbitrary kernels to describe physical phenomena involved in the evolution of the number density function. The implementation is verified with a set of zero-dimensional cases involving aggregation and breakage problems. Comparison to the rigorous solution of the PBE provides validation for these cases. The coupling of the EQMOM procedure with a CFD solver to address aggregation and breakage problems of non-inertial particles is validated against experimental measurements in a Taylor-Couette reactor from the literature.},

This new approach is applied to the case of an axisymmetric advection which represents the leading-order (large time) approximation for Lundgren's family of two-dimensional vortices. It is also generalized to passive scalar advection by non-axisymmetric velocity fields. It is shown that scale interactions generated by an axisymmetric advection are essentially local and dominated by distant triadic interactions: in the case of an evolving spiral vortex sheet this result is confirmed even when non-axisymmetric corrections are included. A physical interpretation of the results is given, which can be summarized by saying that locality of scale interactions is caused by the uniformity of shear at a given scale and is therefore increasingly natural at small lengthscales. Local interactions are shown to arise in axisymmetric advection but to be uncommon in non-axisymmetric advection.},

A nonlinear Markov process is presented, which is able to satisfy exactly, in the statistical sense, incompressibility, the exact results on the third-order structure function, and the experimental second-order statistics. The corresponding equation for the Eulerian probability density of velocity-vector increments is solved numerically. Numerical results show non-Gaussian statistics of the one-dimensional Lagrangian probability distributions, and a complex shape of the three-dimensional Eulerian probability density function.

Surprisingly, we find that particle trajectories in intense dissipation zones are dominated by energy gains sharper than energy losses, contrary to flight crashes, through a pressure-gradient driven take-off phenomenon. Our conclusions are rationalized by analyzing data from simulations of three-dimensional intermittent turbulence, as well as from nonintermittent decimated flows. Lagrangian irreversibility is found to persist even in the latter case, wherein fluctuations of the dissipation rate are shown to be relatively mild and to follow probability distribution functions with exponential tails.},

  abstract = {Population Balance Models have a wide range of applications in many industrial fields as they allow accounting for heterogeneity among properties which are crucial for some system modelling. They actually describe the evolution of a Number Density Function (NDF) using a Population Balance Equation (PBE). For instance, they are applied to gas\textendash liquid columns or stirred reactors, aerosol technology, crystallisation processes, fine particles or biological systems. There is a significant interest for fast, stable and accurate numerical methods in order to solve for PBEs, a class of such methods actually does not solve directly the NDF but resolves their moments. These methods of moments, and in particular quadrature-based methods of moments, have been successfully applied to a variety of systems. Point-wise values of the NDF are sometimes required but are not directly accessible from the moments. To address these issues, the Extended Quadrature Method of Moments (EQMOM) has been developed in the past few years and approximates the NDF, from its moments, as a convex mixture of Kernel Density Functions (KDFs) of the same parametric family. In the present work EQMOM is further developed on two aspects. The main one is a significant improvement of the core iterative procedure of that method, the corresponding reduction of its computational cost is estimated to range from 60\% up to 95\%. The second aspect is an extension of EQMOM to two new KDFs used for the approximation, the Weibull and the Laplace kernels.

The extension of these methods to the quad/octree discretisation allows adaptive variable resolution along the interface and is described in detail. The method is shown to recover exact equilibrium (to machine accuracy) between surfacetension and pressure gradient in the case of a stationary droplet, irrespective of viscosity and spatial resolution. Accurate solutions are obtained for the classical test case of capillary wave oscillations.

The goal is to develop a function or a subroutine that returns the curvature in computational cells containing an interface separating two immiscible fluids, given the volume fraction in the cell and the adjacent cells. Currently, the most accurate approach is to fit a curve (2D), or a surface (3D), matching the volume fractions and finding the curvature by differentiation. Here, a different approach is examined. A synthetic data set, relating curvature to volume fractions, is generated using well-defined shapes where the curvature and volume fractions are easily found and then machine learning is used to fit the data (training). The resulting function is used to find the curvature for shapes not used for the training and implemented into a code to track moving interfaces. The results suggest that using machine learning to generate the relationship is a viable approach that results in reasonably accurate predictions.},

  abstract = {Coagulation and growth of aerosol particles subject to isotropic turbulence has been explored using direct numerical simulations. The computations follow the trajectories of 262 144 initial particles as they are convected by the turbulent flow field. Collision between two parent particles leads to the formation of a new daughter particle with the mass and momentum (but not necessarily the energy) of the parent particles. The initially monodisperse population of particles will develop a size distribution over time that is controlled by the collision dynamics. In an earlier study, Sundaram \& Collins (1997) showed that collision rates in isotropic turbulence are controlled by two statistics: (i) the radial distribution of the particles and (ii) the relative velocity probability density function. Their study considered particles that rebound elastically; however, we find that the formula that they derived is equally valid in a coagulating system. However, coagulation alters the numerical values of these statistics from the values they attain for the elastic rebound case. This difference is substantial and must be taken into consideration to properly predict the evolution of the size distribution of a population of particles. The DNS results also show surprising trends in the relative breadth of the particle size distribution. First, in all cases, the standard deviation of the particle size distribution of particles with finite Stokes numbers is much larger than the standard deviation for either the zero-Stokes-number or infinite-Stokes-number limits. Secondly, for particles with small initial Stokes numbers, the standard deviation of the final particle size distribution decreases with increasing initial particle size; however, the opposite trend is observed for particles with slightly larger initial Stokes numbers. An explanation for these phenomena can be found by carefully examining the functional dependence of the radial distribution function on the particle size and Stokes number.},

In this paper, experimental results reveal that both mechanisms are needed to explain the probability density functions (PDFs) of the droplets in a spray obtained from an industrial fan spray nozzle. Instability of Rayleigh-Taylor type controls the size of the largest droplets while the smallest droplets follow a PDF given by a turbulent cascading mechanism characterized by a log-L\'evy stable law that has a stability parameter equal to 1.70. This value is very close to the inverse value of the Flory exponent and can be related to a recent model developed by N.

  abstract = {A thorough numerical, theoretical and experimental investigation of the liquid atomization in a full cone pressure swirl nozzle is presented. The first part is devoted to the study of the inner flow. CAD and CFD software are used in order to determine the most important parameters of the flow at the exit of nozzle. An important conclusion is the existence of two flow regions: one in relatively slow motion (the boundary layer) and a second nearly in solid rotation at a very high angular rate (about 100 000 rad/s) with a thickness of about 4/5th of the nozzle section. Then, a theoretical and experimental analysis of the flow outside the nozzle is carried out. In the theoretical section, the size of the biggest drops is successfully compared to results stemming from linear instability theory. However, it is also shown that this theory cannot explain the occurrence of small drops observed in the stability domain whose size are close to the Kolmogorov and Taylor turbulent length scale. A Phase Doppler Particle Analyser (PDPA) is used to characterize the droplet size and velocity distribution. Due to centrifugal force, the smaller droplets tend to prevail on the spray axis and a peak close to the Taylor length scale appears progressively in the PDF when increasing the distance from the nozzle. It is then assumed that these small droplets are the results of a turbulent cascading atomization process and that in the near nozzle area, since centrifugal segregation is small, PDF can therefore be fitted with a log-stable law (Rimbert and S\textbackslash 'ero-Guillaume, 2004). The value of the stability index is found to be 1.35 very close to a previous experimental result of 1.39 (Rimbert and Delconte, 2007) but far from a known theoretical value of 1.70 (Rimbert, 2010). This let think about a slightly different underlying process due to the helical nature of the turbulence.},

Indeed, Kolmogorov's discrete process is extended to a continuous time Markov process for the volume distribution instead of the number distribution. New hypotheses are then introduced which lead to log-stable distributions as asymptotic solutions of the fragmentation equation. Log-stable laws are then used to fit experimental probability distribution function (pdf) of Simmons and Hanratty measuring drop sizes in a horizontal annular gas-liquid flow at high Weber number [Int. J. Multiphase Flow 27, 861 (2001)]. Log-stable pdf better fits to the experimental pdf than usual empirical spray pdf and especially, because of the heavy tail of the associated stable distribution, in the small drops part of the distribution.},

Moreover the scaling of turbulence intermittencies with Reynolds number is also obtained and the overall picture is very close to Tennekes' simple model for the fine scale structure of turbulence [Phys.

  abstract = {Bubbly flows involve bubbles randomly distributed within a liquid. At large Reynolds number, they experience an agitation that can combine shear-induced turbulence (SIT), large-scale buoyancy-driven flows, and bubble-induced agitation (BIA). The properties of BIA strongly differ from those of SIT. They have been determined from studies of homogeneous swarms of rising bubbles. Regarding the bubbles, agitation is mainly caused by the wake-induced path instability. Regarding the liquid, two contributions must be distinguished. The first one corresponds to the anisotropic flow disturbances generated near the bubbles, principally in the vertical direction. The second one is the almost isotropic turbulence induced by the flow instability through a population of bubbles, which turns out to be the main cause of horizontal fluctuations. Both contributions generate a k-3 spectral subrange and exponential probability density functions. The subsequent issue will be to understand how BIA interacts with SIT.},

To picture the unresolved droplet formation near the liquid jet interface in the case of coarse grids we considered a theoretical model to describe the unresolved flow instabilities leading to turbulent breakup. These entrained droplets are then represented by an Eulerian\textendash Lagrangian hybrid concept. On the one hand, we used a volume of fluid method (VOF) to characterize the global spreading and the initiation of droplet formation; one the other hand, Lagrangian droplets are released at the liquid\textendash gas interface according to the theoretical model balancing consolidating and disruptive energies. Here, a numerical coupling was required between Eulerian liquid core and Lagrangian droplets using mass and momentum source terms. The presented methodology was tested for different liquid jets in Rayleigh, wind-induced and atomization regimes and validated against literature data. This comparison reveals fairly good qualitative agreement in the cases of jet spreading, jet instability and jet breakup as well as relatively accurate size distribution and Sauter mean diameter (SMD) of the droplets. Furthermore, the model was able to capture the regime transitions from Rayleigh instability to atomization appropriately. Finally, the presented sub-grid model predicts the effect of the gas-phase pressure on the droplet sizes very well.},

  abstract = {Numerical simulation of primary atomization at high Reynolds number is still a challenging problem. In this work a multiscale approach for the numerical simulation of liquid jet primary atomization is applied, using an Eulerian-Lagrangian coupling. In this approach, an Eulerian volume of fluid (VOF) method, where the Reynolds stresses are closed by a Reynolds stress model is applied to model the global spreading of the liquid jet. The formation of the micro-scale droplets, which are usually smaller than the grid spacing in the computational domain, is modelled by an energy-based sub-grid model. Where the disruptive forces (turbulence and surface pressure) of turbulent eddies near the surface of the jet overcome the capillary forces, droplets are released with the local properties of the corresponding eddies. The dynamics of the generated droplets are modelled using Lagrangian particle tracking (LPT). A numerical coupling between the Eulerian and Lagrangian frames is then established via source terms in conservation equations. As a follow-up study to our investigation in Saeedipour et~al. (2016a), the present paper aims at modelling drop formation from liquid jets at high Reynolds numbers in the atomization regime and validating the simulation results against in-house experiments. For this purpose, phase-Doppler anemometry (PDA) was used to measure the droplet size and velocity distributions in sprays produced by water jet breakup at different Reynolds numbers in the atomization regime. The spray properties, such as droplet size spectra, local and global Sauter-mean drop sizes and velocity distributions obtained from the simulations are compared with experiment at various locations with very good agreement.},

  abstract = {Currently, fossil fuels such as oil, coal and natural gas represent the prime energy sources in the world. However, it is anticipated that these sources of energy will deplete within the next 40\textendash 50 years. Moreover, the expected environmental damages such as the global warming, acid rain and urban smog due to the production of emissions from these sources have tempted the world to try to reduce carbon emissions by 80\% and shift towards utilizing a variety of renewable energy resources (RES) which are less environmentally harmful such as solar, wind, biomass etc. in a sustainable way. Biomass is one of the earliest sources of energy with very specific properties. In this review, several aspects which are associated with burning biomass in boilers have been investigated such as composition of biomass, estimating the higher heating value of biomass, comparison between biomass and other fuels, combustion of biomass, cofiring of biomass and coal, impacts of biomass, economic and social analysis of biomass, transportation of biomass, densification of biomass, problems of biomass and future of biomass. It has been found that utilizing biomass in boilers offers many economical, social and environmental benefits such as financial net saving, conservation of fossil fuel resources, job opportunities creation and CO2 and NOx emissions reduction. However, care should be taken to other environmental impacts of biomass such as land and water resources, soil erosion, loss of biodiversity and deforestation. Fouling, marketing, low heating value, storage and collections and handling are all associated problems when burning biomass in boilers. The future of biomass in boilers depends upon the development of the markets for fossil fuels and on policy decisions regarding the biomass market.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a probability density function (PDF) form of the population balance equation (PBE) for polysized and polyshaped droplets and solid particles in turbulent flows. A key contribution of this paper lies in the inclusion of an explicit consideration of the inertial effects and the shape of particles in the PDF-PBE formulation. The number density is taken as a function of droplet or particle size (volume) and shape as well as space and time. Potentially, other particle properties could also be included in the formulation. Inertial effects are quantified through the Stokes number, leading to accurate modelling of the different trajectories that are followed by droplets and/or particles with different sizes and shapes. To treat these effects, a new affordable approach is proposed and referred to as the method of Stokes binning. Here, the inertial dispersed elements are accelerated due to fluid dynamic forces associated with an averaged Stokes number in each bin. The model is validated against two data sets. The first data set includes a series of numerical test cases involving the injection of polyshaped droplets ranging in size from 1 to 50  {$\mu\mu$}m\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x03BC\}\textbackslash text\{m\}  into a turbulent jet resulting in inlet Stokes numbers ranging from 0.03 to 75.2. The second data set consists of an experimental case focusing on the dispersion of 60 and 90  {$\mu\mu$}m\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x03BC\}\textbackslash text\{m\}  spherical droplets in a turbulent round jet, resulting in inlet Stokes numbers of 53 and 122, respectively. The results confirm the ability of the approach to accurately model the polysized and polyshaped droplet dispersion using as few as eight Stokes bins. This approach has the potential to greatly reduce the computational cost of modelling the evolution of inertial droplets and particles in turbulent flows.},

  abstract = {An experimental study of liquid column breakup lengths and turbulent primary breakup properties at the surface of turbulent round liquid jets in still air at standard temperature and pressure is described. Jet exit conditions were limited to non-cavitating water and ethanol flows, long length/diameter ratio (greater than 40:1) constant-diameter round injector passages, jet exit Reynolds numbers of 5000\textendash 200,000, jet exit Weber numbers of 235\textendash 270,000 and liquid/gas density ratios of 690 and 860, at conditions where direct effects of viscosity were small (e.g., liquid jet Ohnesorge numbers were smaller than 0.0053). Three liquid column breakup modes were observed, as follows: a weakly turbulent Rayleigh-like breakup mode observed at small jet exit Weber and Reynolds numbers, a turbulent breakup mode observed at moderate jet exit Weber numbers, and an aerodynamic bag/shear breakup mode observed at large jet Weber numbers. The turbulent primary liquid column breakup mode was associated with conditions where drop diameters resulting from turbulent primary breakup along the liquid surface were comparable to the diameter of the liquid column itself. The bag/shear liquid column breakup mode was observed when liquid turbulence caused large deformations of the liquid column so that portions of it were in a gaseous cross flow; this resulted in bag or shear liquid column breakup, very similar to the breakup of non-turbulent liquid jets in gaseous cross flow. Mean streamwise drop velocities after breakup were comparable to mean streamwise velocities within the jet whereas mean cross stream drop velocities after breakup were comparable to cross stream velocity fluctuations within the liquid. Rates of primary breakup at the liquid surface are reported as surface efficiency factors (the fraction of the maximum possible cross stream drop liquid flux at the surface based on the mean relative cross stream velocity of the drops at the surface and the liquid density). The resulting surface efficiency factors varied from small values near the onset of liquid surface breakup to values of the order of unity as conditions near breakup of the liquid column as a whole were approached.},

Primary atomization on diesel spray is not well understood due to the difficulties to perform experimental measurements in the near nozzle field. Hence computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has been used as a key element to understand and improve diesel spray. A recent new code for incompressible multiphase flow with adaptive octree mesh refinement has been used to perform simulations of atomization at low injection pressure conditions. The multiphase flow strategy to manage different flows is the volume of fluid (VOF) method. The adaptive mesh allows to locally refine the mesh at each time step where a better resolution is needed to capture important gradients instead of using a static mesh with a fixed and high number of cells which, in turn, would lead to an unaffordable computational cost. Even with this approach, the cell number is very high to achieve a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) at reasonable computational cost. To reduce the computational cost, an idea has been explored, the possibility of setting a maximum number of cells of the domain. Following this idea, the code has been tested with different configurations to understand their effects on numerical stability, the change in different spray parameters and the benefits achieved in terms of execution time. The outcomes have been validated against a theoretical model.},

Specifically, we use high-speed imaging to directly examine the fluid fragmentation at the exit of the mouths of healthy subjects. We reveal for the first time that the breakup of the fluid into droplets continues to occur outside of the respiratory tract during violent exhalations. We show that such breakup involves a complex cascade of events from sheets, to bag bursts, to ligaments, which finally break into droplets. Finally, we reveal that the viscoelasticity of the mucosalivary fluid plays an important role in delaying fragmentation by causing the merger of the droplet precursors that form along stretched filaments; thereby affecting the final drop size distribution farther downstream.},

In particular, the analyzed cases are characterized by variable values of Reynolds, Ohnesorge and Weber numbers.

The numerical results are compared with a theoretical analysis of liquid\textendash gas layer for a parameter range close to high-speed Diesel jet fuel injection. For intermittent and short-duration Diesel injection, the aerodynamic surface interaction and transient head formation play an important role. The present numerical setting excludes nozzle disturbances to primarily investigate this interfacial instability mechanism and the role of jet head. The first disturbed area is the jet head region, and the generated disturbances are fed into the upstream region through the gas phase. This leads to the viscous boundary layer instability development on the liquid jet core. By temporal tracking of surface pattern development including the phase velocity and stability regime and by the visualization of vortex structures near the boundary layer region, it is suggested that the instability mode is the Tollmien\textendash Schlichting (TS) mode similar to the turbulent transition of solid-wall boundary layer. It is also demonstrated that the jet head and the liquid core play an interacting role, thus the jet head cannot be neglected in Diesel injection. In this study, this type of boundary layer instability has been demonstrated as a possible mechanism of primary atomization, especially for high-speed straight liquid jets. The effect of nozzle turbulence is a challenging but important issue, and it should be examined in the future.},

A statistical model based on the joint fluid-particle probability distribution function kinetic equation is introduced, which accounts for the modification of the collision probability due to the correlation of the velocities of colliding particles. To study the long-range spatial correlation of the particle velocities, a conditional average, for a given fluid turbulent flow, is introduced. This approach allows us to separate the instantaneous velocity of any particle into two parts: a turbulent contribution, from an underlying continuous velocity field shared by all the particles, and a random contribution obeying the `molecular chaos' assumption.

The solution corresponding to external gravitational propagation is filtered by requiring the vertically integrated divergence to vanish identically. The vertical structure permits as dependent variables the horizontal wind at two internal levels and a single temperature, with the static stability entering as a parameter.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The incoming radiation is a function of latitude only corresponding to the annual mean, and the outgoing radiation is taken to be a function of the local temperature. With the requirement for thermal equilibrium, the domain mean temperature is specified as a parameter. The role of condensation is taken into account only as it effectively reduces the static stability. All other external sources and sinks of heat are assumed to balance each other locally, and are thus omitted. The kinematics are that of a fluid on a sphere bounded by smooth zonal walls at the equator and at approximately 64\textdegree{} latitude. The dissipative sinks are provided by: (a) surface stresses proportional through a drag coefficient to the square of the surface wind which is suitably extrapolated from above, (b) internal convective stresses proportional to the vertical wind shear, and (c) lateral diffusion of momentum and heat through an exchange coefficient which depends on the local horizontal rate of strain\textemdash a horizontal length scale entering as the governing parameter.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}For a given specification of the parameters, an integration for 60 days has been made from initial conditions where random temperature disturbances have been superimposed on a zonally symmetric regime which is baroclinically unstable according to linear theory. This experiment not only displays the scale selective character of baroclinic instability, yielding zonal wave number 5 to 6, but also predicts an index or energy cycle. The period of this cycle is 11 to 12 days for the first 40 days of the experiment, then lengthening to 17 days while diminishing in amplitude during the latter part.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The resulting mean zonal velocity profile is in good qualitative agreement with observation, but too intense, presumably because the effective static stability parameter is taken too large. Furthermore this profile is found to be no more than 5 percent super-geostrophic poleward of the angular momentum maximum and no more than 2 percent sub-geostrophic equatorward. The total zonal angular momentum remains constant to within 2 percent irrespective of the phase of the index cycle. This balance is controlled by the surface wind distribution which agrees quite well with observation. The poleward transport is mainly accomplished by the large-scale eddies, whereas the internal vertical flux is predominantly a transfer of the earth's angular momentum by the meridional circulation.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The poleward heat transport is primarily accomplished by a Hadley circulation at low latitudes but by the large-scale horizontal eddies in mid-latitudes, where a Ferrel circulation tends to compensate through an equatorward flux. This compensation at mid-latitudes by an indirect meridional circulation is also quite evident, in the potential-kinetic energy transformations. Comparison of the momentum and heat transfer with observed data when available shows reasonably good quantitative agreement.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}The lateral transfer of momentum and heat by the non-linear diffusion, which parametrically is supposed to simulate the action of motions of sub-grid scale, accounts for a significant portion of the total eddy transfer. Although no direct comparison with the corresponding transfer in the real atmosphere is available, intuitively our small-scale diffusion appears to play too large a role.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$>$}A diagnosis is made of the transformations among the baratropic and baroclinic parts of the kinetic energy as well as the zonal mean and zonal perturbation parts of the available potential and kinetic energy. This reveals the dominant paths that the energy passes through from source to ultimate sinks and the processes responsible for these transformations. It is found that the partitioning of dissipation by the energy components may differ considerably from estimates made from observation.{$<$}/p{$><$}p{$><$}/p{$><$}/section{$>$}},

We merged these records with ecological characteristics of the causal pathogens to examine global temporal trends in the total number of outbreaks, disease richness (number of unique diseases), disease diversity (richness and outbreak evenness) and               per capita               cases. Bacteria, viruses, zoonotic diseases (originating in animals) and those caused by pathogens transmitted by vector hosts were responsible for the majority of outbreaks in our dataset. After controlling for disease surveillance, communications, geography and host availability, we find the total number and diversity of outbreaks, and richness of causal diseases increased significantly since 1980 (               p               {$<$} 0.0001). When we incorporate Internet usage into the model to control for biased reporting of outbreaks (starting 1990), the overall number of outbreaks and disease richness still increase significantly with time (               p               {$<$} 0.0001), but               per capita               cases decrease significantly (               p               = 0.005).

  abstract = {Detached-eddy simulation (DES) was first proposed in 1997 and first used in 1999, so its full history can be surveyed. A DES community has formed, with adepts and critics, as well as new branches. The initial motivation of high\textendash Reynolds number, massively separated flows remains, for which DES is convincingly more capable presently than either unsteady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) or large-eddy simulation (LES). This review discusses compelling examples, noting the visual and quantitative success of DES. Its principal weakness is its response to ambiguous grids, in which the wall-parallel grid spacing is of the order of the boundary-layer thickness. In some situations, DES on a given grid is then less accurate than RANS on the same grid or DES on a coarser grid. Partial remedies have been found, yet dealing with thickening boundary layers and shallow separation bubbles is a central challenge. The nonmonotonic response of DES to grid refinement is disturbing to most observers, as is the absence of a theoretical order of accuracy. These issues also affect LES in any nontrivial flow. This review also covers the numerical needs of DES, gridding practices, coupling with different RANS models, derivative uses such as wall modeling in LES, and extensions such as zonal DES and delayed DES.},

  abstract = {Zoonotic disease outbreaks are an important threat to human health and numerous drivers have been recognized as contributing to their increasing frequency. Identifying and quantifying relationships between drivers of zoonotic disease outbreaks and outbreak severity is critical to developing targeted zoonotic disease surveillance and outbreak prevention strategies. However, quantitative studies of outbreak drivers on a global scale are lacking. Attributes of countries such as press freedom, surveillance capabilities and latitude also bias global outbreak data. To illustrate these issues, we review the characteristics of the 100 largest outbreaks in a global dataset (               n               = 4463 bacterial and viral zoonotic outbreaks), and compare them with 200 randomly chosen background controls. Large outbreaks tended to have more drivers than background outbreaks and were related to large-scale environmental and demographic factors such as changes in vector abundance, human population density, unusual weather conditions and water contamination. Pathogens of large outbreaks were more likely to be viral and vector-borne than background outbreaks. Overall, our case study shows that the characteristics of large zoonotic outbreaks with thousands to millions of cases differ consistently from those of more typical outbreaks. We also discuss the limitations of our work, hoping to pave the way for more comprehensive future studies.

The profile relaxation has a destabilizing effect just as does the aerodynamic interaction. In the absence of velocity-profile relaxation it is shown that the available theories overestimate the aerodynamic effect. A consideration of the viscosity of the ambient fluid yields a semi-empirical modification to the theory which shows good agreement with experimental values.},

  abstract = {The purpose of this study is to characterize the atomization of a jet of water sprayed into the air at high velocity through a commercial nozzle widely used for sprinkler irrigation. The typical diameter of the droplets present in the spray is in the range of several tens of micrometers to several millimeters. They are visualized by ombroscopy. A specific Droplet Tracking Velocimetry (DTV) technique is developed to estimate the size and velocity of these highly polydispersed droplets that are distinctly non spherical. This analysis is performed from the rupture of the liquid core region (about a distance of 550 nozzle diameters) to the dispersed zone (about a distance of 900 nozzle diameters). With this technique, we obtain joint size-velocity measurements that are rarely produced. Especially two velocity components and also a large diameter range are characterized at the same time; while with other techniques, such as Particle Doppler Anemometry (PDA), the diameter range is quite reduced and requires specific settings. Additional measurements of the liquid volume fraction are performed using a single mode fiber-optic probe. In the light of our experimental data, it appears that the turbulent droplet motion in the spray is strongly anisotropic. This anisotropy is quite unexpected because other studies on sprays (generally concerned with engine applications) show a relatively low anisotropy. We attribute this increase of anisotropy to the fact that, for this type of spray, the droplet relaxation time is long in comparison to the characteristic time of the turbulence and that biggest droplets are still submitted to atomization process. This strong anisotropy is responsible for the poor radial dispersion of the spray.},

  abstract = {The present work examines numerically the deformation and breakup of free falling droplets subjected to a continuous cross flow. The model is based on the solution of the Navier\textendash Stokes equations coupled with the Volume of Fluid (VOF) methodology utilized for tracking the droplet-air interface; an adaptive local grid refinement is implemented in order to decrease the required computational cost. Neglecting initially the effect of the vertical droplet motion, a 2D axisymmetric approximation is adopted to shed light on influential numerical parameters. Following that, 3D simulations are performed which include inertial, surface and gravitational forces. The model performance is assessed by comparing the results against published experimental data for the bag breakup and the sheet thinning breakup regimes. Furthermore, a parametric study reveals the model capabilities for a wider range of Weber numbers. It is proved that the model is capable of capturing qualitatively the breakup process, while the numerical parameters that best predict the experimental data are identified.},

The surfactants are assumed soluble in the external liquid shearing the surface and can adsorb onto the interfaces. Two different adsorption models are used: a classical Frumkin model and a more advanced model that better describes the decrease of surface tension for minuscule concentrations. The simulations show that LIS may face even more severe effects of surfactants than previously investigated superhydrophobic surfaces. Constructing an analytical model for the effective slip length, we can predict the critical surfactant concentration for which the slip length decreases significantly. This analytical model describes both adsorption models of LIS on a unified framework if properly adjusted. We also advance the understanding of when surfactant advection gives rise to highly skewed interfacial concentrations: the so-called partial stagnant cap regime. To a good approximation, this regime can only exist below a specific surfactant concentration given by the Marangoni number and the strength of the surfactants.},

By resorting to a generalized version of the K\'arm\'an\textendash Howarth\textendash Kolmogorov equation, this intriguing observation is shown to be an illusion, hiding a measurable influence of coherent structures and statistical inhomogeneity. This striking conclusion highlights that a complete statistical theory of turbulence cannot dispense with the influence of large scales, possibly coherent, motions.},

Throughout this process, the flow dynamics may be different depending on the region of the flow and the scales of the involved liquid structures. Exploring this multi-scale, multi-dimensional phenomenon requires some new theoretical tools, some of which need yet to be elaborated. Here, a new analytical framework is proposed on the basis of two-point statistical equations of the liquid volume fraction. This tool, which originates from single phase turbulence, allows us notably to decompose the fluxes of liquid in flow\textendash position space and scale space. Direct numerical simulations of liquid\textendash gas turbulence decaying in a triply periodic domain are then used to characterize the time and scale evolution of the liquid volume fraction. It is emphasized that two-point statistics of the liquid volume fraction depend explicitly on the geometrical properties of the liquid\textendash gas interface and in particular its surface density. The stretch rate of the liquid\textendash gas interface is further shown to be the equivalent for the liquid volume fraction (a non-diffusive scalar) of the scalar dissipation rate. Finally, a decomposition of the transport of liquid in scale space highlights that non-local interactions between non-adjacent scales play a significant role.},

The contribution of the different processes in the combined scale/physical space is quantified by means of direct numerical simulations of a temporally liquid\textendash gas shear layer. Light is first shed onto the relationship between two-point statistics of the phase indicator and the geometrical properties of the liquid/gas interface, namely its surface density, mean and Gaussian curvatures. Then, the theory is shown to be adequate for highlighting the preferential direction of liquid transport in either scale or flow position space. A direct cascade process, i.e. from large to small scales, is observed for the total phase indicator field, while the opposite applies for the randomly fluctuating part, suggesting a transfer of `energy' from the mean to the fluctuating component. In the space of positions within the flow, the flux tends to redistribute energy from the centreline to the edge of the shear layer. The influence of the mean shear rate and statistical inhomogeneities on the different scales of the liquid field are revealed.},

Collisions between two particles are efficiently predicted using a spatial-hashing algorithm. The code is validated by comparing the numerical simulations for the motion of particles in several vortical structures with analytical solutions.

However, the spray formation processes, the droplet dynamics and the final drop size distributions are still not sufficiently understood due to the coupled gas-liquid interactions and turbulence generation. Therefore, empirical and semi-empirical approaches are typically used to estimate the global spray parameters. To develop a physical understanding of the spray evolution, a plain-jet airblast atomizer was investigated in an atmospheric spray rig using the phase-Doppler technique. The simultaneous drop size and axial and radial velocity components were measured on radial traverses across the spray at various axial distances from the nozzle for a range of atomizing pressures. The droplet turbulent and mean kinetic energies were found to be proportional to the atomizing pressure. Hence, the scatter of the radial motion of the droplets increased with the atomizing pressure. A droplet stability analysis was performed to locate the regions characterized by ongoing secondary atomization. The volume-to-surface diameter, D32, of the fully developed spray was compared with estimates provided by five published formulae. The role of liquid viscosity, hence the Ohnesorge number, was found to be negligible in the investigated regime. Three commonly used size distribution functions were fitted to the measured data to analyze their dependence on the atomizing pressure. The Gamma distribution function was found to give the best approximation to the atomization process.},

Their results were supported by the Monte Carlo simulation of a non-interacting coagulating population of suspended spherical particles developed by Pearson, Valioulis \& List (1984). Here the realism of the Monte Carlo simulation is improved by accounting for the modification to the coagulation rate caused by van der Waals', electrostatic and hydrodynamic forces acting between particles. The results indicate that the major hypothesis underlying the dimensional reasoning, that is, collisions between particles of similar size are most important in determining the shape of the particle size distribution, is valid only for shear-induced coagulation. It is shown that dimensional analysis cannot, in general, be used to predict equilibrium particle-size distributions, mainly because of the strong dependence of the interparticle force on the absolute and relative size of the interacting particles.},

  abstract = {We present a proof-of-concept for the adaptive mesh refinement method applied to atmospheric boundary-layer simulations. Such a method may form an attractive alternative to static grids for studies on atmospheric flows that have a high degree of scale separation in space and/or time. Examples include the diurnal cycle and a convective boundary layer capped by a strong inversion. For such cases, large-eddy simulations using regular grids often have to rely on a subgrid-scale closure for the most challenging regions in the spatial and/or temporal domain. Here we analyze a flow configuration that describes the growth and subsequent decay of a convective boundary layer using direct numerical simulation (DNS). We validate the obtained results and benchmark the performance of the adaptive solver against two runs using fixed regular grids. It appears that the adaptive-mesh algorithm is able to coarsen and refine the grid dynamically whilst maintaining an accurate solution. In particular, during the initial growth of the convective boundary layer a high resolution is required compared to the subsequent stage of decaying turbulence. More specifically, the number of grid cells varies by two orders of magnitude over the course of the simulation. For this specific DNS case, the adaptive solver was not yet more efficient than the more traditional solver that is dedicated to these types of flows. However, the overall analysis shows that the method has a clear potential for numerical investigations of the most challenging atmospheric cases.},

The dynamics ruling the radius of the sheet, its stability and the resulting fragment drop size distribution are documented experimentally. The radius dynamics results from a simple balance between inertia of the initial drop and capillary restoring forces at the rim, with damping due to the continuous transfer of momentum from the sheet to the rim. The ligaments expelled from the rim originate from a Rayleigh\textendash Taylor mechanism localized at the rim. The final drop size distribution in the spray is shown to be a linear superposition of gamma distributions characteristic of ligament breakup, leading generically to Bessel functions.},

Between these extremes, patterns emerge, possibly interact, and die sooner or later. This review summarizes recent developments on the problem of mixing in its lamellar representation. This point of view visualizes a mixture as a set of stretched lamellae, or sheets, possibly interacting with each other. It relies on a near-exact formulation of the Fourier equation on a moving substrate and allows one to bridge the spatial structure and evolution of the concentration field with its statistical content in a direct way. Within this frame, one can precisely describe both the dynamics of the concentration levels in a mixture as a function of the intensity of the stirring motions at the scale of a single lamella and the interaction rule between adjacent lamellae, thus offering a detailed representation of the mixture content, its structure, and their evolution in time.

Relating the shape of these interfaces to the stirring field giving birth to it, we formalize a population balance dynamics for the r-elements (segments of length r) needed to cover the interface contour in the course of its deformation. As long as corrugations grow kinematically, shapes change continuously, their fractal dimension df(r,t) is a non-monotonous function of the scale r, and increases in time t with no bounds. Interface creation and destruction balance, however, in self-propagating fronts like flames, and in fronts smearing by molecular diffusion, through a mixing induced overlap mechanism, leading to a stationary shape. These findings, which help reexamining old observations in a new perspective, also reconcile kinetics with geometry.

We use necklaces of cohesive particles (magnetized spheres) as an experimental model of a one-dimensional material, which we expand radially in an impulsive way. Exploring in real time the intermediate state where the particles are no longer in contact, but still in interaction as they separate, we demonstrate that the final fragments result from the self-assembly of individual particles and that their size distribution converges to a stable self-similar distribution whose parameters, interpreted from first principles, depend on the expansion and cohesion strengths.},

  abstract = {Ligamentary structures are often encountered in liquid atomization processes. They appear for instance during the atomization of liquid sheets issuing from triple-disk nozzles. Because of the development of turbulence along the internal wall of the discharge orifice, these sheets are highly perturbed and exhibit the formation of ligaments along their sides. The present investigation addresses the question of the origin of size dispersion of the droplets emanating from the atomization of these ligaments. The adopted strategy consists in describing the atomization process reported by experimental images by using a multi-scale tool and in conducting an analysis that concentrates on the dynamic of the small structures carried by the ligaments that might be the main small droplets providers. The advantages of the tool are its ease of application as well as its capacity to bring an information that incorporate the shape of the analyzed interface. The statistical scale analysis demonstrates that the small structures carried by the ligaments are subject to an elongation mechanism whose strength varies from one liquid to another. This mechanism is not dominant in the production of the small drops from the breakup of the ligaments. The dispersion of the drop size distribution, represented by the order of a Gamma distribution, is found to strongly correlate with the initial deformation of the ligaments. An interesting result here is the ease of characterizing the average ligament deformation with the concept of scale distribution. The fact that a single parameter is sufficient to represent the drop size dispersion and that this dispersion correlates with the ligaments deformation suggests the dominance of a single mechanism in the ligament breakup, i.e., the capillary mechanism. As demonstrated in a previous investigation, capillary mechanism is associated with elongation mechanism at small scales. All these results are strengthened by the fact that the explored experimental conditions are uncorrelated.},

  abstract = {A numerical study of micro-explosion for multi-component droplets in diesel engines is presented. The first part of the model comprises the thermodynamic description of the droplet, the mathematical formulation of the bubble generation and growth inside the droplet, and the final explosion of the droplet. After the explosion that shatters the droplet, the size and velocity of secondary droplets are determined by a linear stability analysis. An extension to the previous model, which allows a generic probability function to be inserted, is proposed. Comparison of droplet behaviors for ethanol-tetradecane mixtures with and without micro-explosion shows that micro-explosion shortens the droplet lifetime. Ambient temperature does not have a significant effect on micro-explosion. However, it is observed that high ambient pressure is more likely to induce micro-explosion. There exists an optimal composition of about 50\% of ethanol for micro-explosion. Mixture composition does not have significant effect on the secondary droplet sizes, so does the parent droplet size. But numerical results show that secondary droplets tend to be smaller with ethanol-rich mixtures. On the other hand, the initial droplet size showed a significant effect on the secondary droplet velocity with small initial droplet radius. The secondary droplet velocity for an initially 10 Pm is six times as high as those with initial sizes larger than 15 Pm. It is found that micro-explosion is possible for ethanol/tetradecane mixtures in typical diesel engine operation. The occurrence of micro-explosion and the subsequent breakup promotes droplet atomization and enhance droplet dispersion which in turns improves engine performance and reduces emissions of soot and unburned hydrocarbon.},

  abstract = {A numerical study of micro-explosion for multi-component droplets in diesel engines is presented. The first part of the model comprises the thermodynamic description of the droplet, the mathematical formulation of the bubble generation and growth inside the droplet, and the final explosion of the droplet. After the explosion that shatters the droplet, the size and velocity of secondary droplets are determined by a linear stability analysis. An extension to the previous model, which allows a generic probability function to be inserted, is proposed. Comparison of droplet behaviors for ethanol-tetradecane mixtures with and without micro-explosion shows that micro-explosion shortens the droplet lifetime. Ambient temperature does not have a significant effect on micro-explosion. However, it is observed that high ambient pressure is more likely to induce micro-explosion. There exists an optimal composition of about 50\% of ethanol for micro-explosion. Mixture composition does not have significant effect on the secondary droplet sizes, so does the parent droplet size. But numerical results show that secondary droplets tend to be smaller with ethanol-rich mixtures. On the other hand, the initial droplet size showed a significant effect on the secondary droplet velocity with small initial droplet radius. The secondary droplet velocity for an initially 10 Pm is six times as high as those with initial sizes larger than 15 Pm. It is found that micro-explosion is possible for ethanol/tetradecane mixtures in typical diesel engine operation. The occurrence of micro-explosion and the subsequent breakup promotes droplet atomization and enhance droplet dispersion which in turns improves engine performance and reduces emissions of soot and unburned hydrocarbon.},

This fortunate viewing permitted ion plasma parameters to be measured, particularly flow speeds in both regions near simultaneously for the first time, facilitating detailed investigation of the multiple boundaries crossings. This allowed different plasma regions to be identified via analysis of thermal ion data (plasma velocity, densities and temperatures of protons and water group ions) and a search for Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities to be undertaken. This interval had previously been studied by Masters et al. (2010), who identified a single Kelvin-Helmholtz vortex, however their study lacked ion plasma parameters and a measured flow speed. The new processed ion data set presented here supports their identification and identifies a second vortex {$\sim$}3 h earlier, highlighting the value of ion plasma parameters to such studies.},

Passive satellite retrievals (e.g., Multiangle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR) and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS)) and global aerosol transport models show a distinct AOD maximum around the 60\textdegree S latitude band. Sun photometer measurements performed by the Maritime Aerosol Network (MAN), on the other hand, indicate no increased AODs over the Southern Ocean. In this study elevated Southern Ocean AODs are examined from the modeling perspective. The primary aerosol component over the Southern Ocean is sea spray aerosol (SSA). Multiple simulations of SSA concentrations and optical depths are carried out using a single modeling framework, the Navy Aerosol Analysis and Prediction System (NAAPS) model. Several SSA emission functions are examined, including recently proposed formulations with sea surface temperature corrections. The differences between NAAPS simulations are primarily due to different SSA emission formulations. The results are compared against satellite-derived AODs from the MISR and MODIS instruments. MISR and MODIS AOD retrievals are further filtered to eliminate retrievals potentially affected by cloud contamination and cloud adjacency effects. The results indicate a very large impact of SSA emission parameterization on the simulated AODs. For some scenarios, the Southern Ocean AOD maximum almost completely disappears. Further MISR and MODIS AOD quality screening substantially improves model/satellite agreement. Based on these comparisons, an optimal SSA emission function for global aerosol transport models is recommended.},

Puked shadowgraph photography and holography were used to find conditions at the onset of breakup as well as drop properties as a function of distance from the jet exit. Two main aerodynamic effects were observed, as follows: (1) enhanced primary breakup near the onset of breakup; and (2) merged primary and secondary breakup when the Rayleigh breakup times of ligaments formed by turbulent fluctuations were longer than the secondary breakup times of similar sized drops. The predictions of phenomenological theories based on these ideas were in good agreement with the measurements.},

  abstract = {The effects of initial flow conditions on the primary breakup of nonturbulent and turbulent round liquid jets in still gases was studied experimentally. Pressure-atomized jets were provided by a piston/cylinder arrangement followed by a converging passage to yield a nonturbulent flow. The degree of flow development at the jet exit was controlled by removing the boundary layer formed along the converging passage, and providing constant-diameter passages of various lengths after boundary-layer removal. Test conditions included water, n-heptane, and various glycerol mixtures injected into helium, air, and Freon 12 at pressures of 1 and 2 atm, to yield liquid/gas density ratios in the range 104-7240. Pulsed photography and holography were used to observe the liquid surface prior to primary breakup. The results highlight the importance of liquid vorticity at the jet exit on primary breakup at these conditions: Experiments with nearly vorticity-free exit conditions (passage length/diameter ratio, L/d = 0.15) caused primary breakup to be suppressed, yielding stable liquid jets similar to those used in liquid jet cutting processes. In contrast, larger L/d at sufficiently high Reynolds numbers caused transition to turbulent jets having wrinkled surfaces prior to primary breakup by the turbulent primary breakup mechanism. A breakup regime map was developed, yielding behavior in the turbulent primary breakup regime for L/d {$>$} 4-6 and passage Reynolds numbers {$>$} 1-4 \texttimes{} 104. Within the turbulent primary breakup regime, conditions for the onset of breakup and the evolution of drop sizes with distance from the jet exit were relatively independent of L/d for values up to 212. Finally, a new correlation for drop sizes after primary breakup at nonturbulent conditions (but with laminar boundary layers present along the passage wall) was developed, based on consideration of boundary-layer thicknesses at the jet exit.},

We elucidate this difference by studying experimentally and numerically the fluctuations of the energy of a small fluid particle moving in a turbulent fluid. We demonstrate how the fundamental property of detailed balance is broken, so that the probabilities of forward and backward transitions are not equal for turbulence. In physical terms, we found that in a large set of flow configurations, fluid elements decelerate faster than accelerate, a feature known all too well from driving in dense traffic. The statistical signature of rare ``flight\textendash crash'' events, associated with fast particle deceleration, provides a way to quantify irreversibility in a turbulent flow. Namely, we find that the third moment of the power fluctuations along a trajectory, nondimensionalized by the energy flux, displays a remarkable power law as a function of the Reynolds number, both in two and in three spatial dimensions. This establishes a relation between the irreversibility of the system and the range of active scales. We speculate that the breakdown of the detailed balance characterized here is a general feature of other systems very far from equilibrium, displaying a wide range of spatial scales.},

The effects of the surface tension, liquid jet radius, air boundary layer, liquid consistency coefficients, gas dynamic viscosity, power-law index, and the relative velocity between the liquid and gas phase on the maximum growth rate and the dominant wave number are studied. The investigation shows that the maximum growth rate and the dominant wave number increase with the increase of the relative velocity and gas dynamic viscosity, while they both decrease as the liquid surface tension, liquid jet radius, air boundary layer, and power-law index increase. Therefore, increasing the relative velocity and gas dynamic viscosity, or decreasing the liquid surface tension, liquid jet radius, air boundary layer, liquid consistency coefficient, or power-law index will improve the instability of the liquid jet and be advantageous for the breakup of the liquid jet.

Three distinct breakup mechanisms are identified in the primary breakup, which are well categorized on the parameter space of gas Weber number ( WegWe\_\{g\} ) versus liquid Reynolds number ( RelRe\_\{l\} ). These mechanisms are analysed here from a vortex dynamics perspective. Vortex dynamics explains the hairpin formation, and the interaction between the hairpins and the Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz (KH) roller explains the perforation of the lobes, which is attributed to the streamwise overlapping of two oppositely oriented hairpin vortices on top and bottom of the lobe. The formation of corrugations on the lobe front edge at high  RelRe\_\{l\}  is also related to the location and structure of the hairpins with respect to the KH vortex. The lobe perforation and corrugation formation are inhibited at low  RelRe\_\{l\}  and low  WegWe\_\{g\}  due to the high surface tension and viscous forces, which damp the small-scale corrugations and resist hole formation. Streamwise vorticity generation \textendash{} resulting in three-dimensional instabilities \textendash{} is mainly caused by vortex stretching and baroclinic torque at high and low density ratios, respectively. Generation of streamwise vortices and their interaction with spanwise vortices produce the liquid structures seen at various flow conditions.

  abstract = {A three-dimensional transient round liquid jet within a low-speed coaxial outer gas flow is numerically simulated and analysed via vortex dynamics (                                                {$\mathsl{\lambda}$}2{$\mathsl{\lambda}$}2\textbackslash unicode[STIX]\{x1D706\}\_\{2\}                            analysis). Two types of surface deformations are distinguished, which are separated by a large indentation on the jet stem. First, there are those inside the recirculation zone behind the leading cap \textendash{} directly affecting the cap dynamics and well explained by the local vortices. Second, deformations upstream of the cap are mainly driven by the Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz (KH) instability, unaffected by the vortices in the behind-the-cap region (BCR), and are important in the eventual atomization process. Different atomization mechanisms are identified and are delineated on a gas Weber number (                                                {$\mathsl{W}\mathsl{e}\mathsl{g}$}WegWe\_\{g\}                           ) versus liquid Reynolds number (                                                {$\mathsl{R}\mathsl{e}\mathsl{l}$}RelRe\_\{l\}                           ) map based on the relative gas\textendash liquid velocity. In a frame moving with the liquid velocity, this result is consistent with prior temporal studies. A simpler and clearer portrait of similarity of the atomization domains is shown by using the relative gas\textendash liquid axial velocity, i.e.                                                 {$\mathsl{W}\mathsl{e}\mathsl{r}$}WerWe\_\{r\}                            and                                                 {$\mathsl{R}\mathsl{e}\mathsl{r}$}RerRe\_\{r\}                           , and avoiding the widely used velocity ratio as a third key parameter. A detailed comparison of vorticity along the axis in an Eulerian frame versus a frame fixed to a surface wave reveals that the vortex development and surface deformations are periodic in the upstream region, but this periodicity is lost closer to the BCR. In the practical range of the density ratio and for early times in the process, axial vorticity is mainly generated by baroclinicity while streamwise vortex stretching becomes more important at later times and only at lower relative velocities when pressure gradients are reduced. The inertia, vortex, pressure, viscous and surface tension forces are analysed to delineate the dominant causes of the three-dimensional instability of the axisymmetric KH structure due to surface acceleration in the axial, radial and azimuthal directions. The inertia force related to the axial gradient of kinetic energy is the main cause of the axial acceleration of the waves, while the azimuthal acceleration is mainly caused by the pressure and viscous forces. The viscous forces are negligible in the radial direction and away from the nozzle exit in the axial direction. It is interesting to note that azimuthal viscous forces are important even at high                                                 {$\mathsl{R}\mathsl{e}\mathsl{l}$}RelRe\_\{l\}                           , indicating that inertia is not totally dominant in this instability occurring early in the atomization cascade.},

  abstract = {The injection and atomization of gasoline fuels are critical to the performance of gasoline direct injection engines. Due to the complex nature of the primary breakup of the liquid jet in the near field, high-level details are often difficult to measure in experiments. In the present study, detailed numerical simulations are performed to investigate the primary breakup of a gasoline surrogate jet under non-evaporative "Spray G" operating conditions. The Spray G injector and operating conditions, developed by the Engine Combustion Network (ECN), represent the early phase of spray-guided gasoline injection. To focus the computational resources on resolving the primary breakup, simplifications have been made on the injector geometry. The effect of the internal flow on the primary breakup is modeled by specifying a nonzero injection angle at the inlet. The nonzero injection angle results in an increase of the jet penetration speed and also a deflection of the liquid jet. A parametric study on the injection angle is performed, and the numerical results are compared to the experimental data to identify the injection angle that best represents the Spray G conditions. The nonzero injection angle introduces an azimuthally non-uniform velocity in the liquid jet, which in turn influences the instability development on the jet surfaces and also the deformation and breakup of the jet head. The asymmetric primary breakup dynamics eventually lead to an azimuthal variation of droplet size distributions. The number of droplets varies significantly with the azimuthal angle, but interestingly, the probability density functions (PDF) of droplet size for different azimuthal angles collapse to a self-similar profile. The self-similar PDF is fitted with both lognormal and gamma distribution functions. Analysis has also been conducted to estimate the percentage and statistics of the tiny droplets that are under resolved in the present simulation. The PDF of the azimuthal angle is also presented, which is also shown to exhibit a self-similar form that varies little over time. The PDF of the azimuthal angle is well represented by a hyperbolic tangent function. Finally, a model is developed to predict the droplet number as a function of droplet diameter, azimuthal angle where a droplet is located, and time.},

  abstract = {The direct numerical simulation of two phase interfacial flows can be computationally challenging, as the strong resolution needed to follow the deformations of the interface leads to a lot of time spent solving the whole computation domain. Efficient solution of such problems requires an adaptive mesh refinement capability to concentrate computational effort where it is most needed. In this paper a parallel adaptive algorithm to solve incompressible two-phase flows with surface tension is presented: the AMR is handled with the help of the PARAMESH package. The free interface between fluids is tracked via Level Set approach; the jump conditions at the interface for pressure and velocity are imposed by the Ghost Fluid method. A multigrid preconditioned BiCG-stab solver adapted to the AMR data structure has been developed to allow high density ratio computations (up to 1:1000). Special treatment has been done at the refinement jumps to maintain the fine mesh accuracy. Computational results are compared in different test cases with analytical solutions or literature, and show very good agreement with the references. The effectiveness of PARAMESH parallelization has been quite well maintained, as shown in the strong and weak scaling tests. Speed-up capabilities of the AMR are demonstrated.},

  abstract = {The physics of atomization process involve many spatial scales, generating a wide variety of liquid inclusions of different sizes with large density and viscosity ratios between liquid and gas phases. In order to correctly capture the dynamics of these phenomena, each scale needs to be resolved with an appropriate method to ensure the conservation of physical quantities (mass, momentum) as well as the jump conditions across the liquid-gas interface. To address these problems, an original multi-scale methodology has been developed. It consists of a core coupled Level-Set/Volume-of-Fluid method (CLSVOF) for accurate capture of primary atomization, an adaptive mesh refinement technique (oct-tree AMR) to dynamically optimize the structured Cartesian mesh and a particle tracking algorithm to capture droplet dynamics. An improved Eulerian\textendash Lagrangian coupling has been developed to ensure a smooth transition between the Eulerian and the Lagrangian modelling frameworks in the zones where they reach their respective limits of validity. The overall procedure is tested on simplified numerical tests and validated on a realistic planar liquid sheet atomization case. Results highlight the ability of the present method to reproduce the whole atomization process, from large scale instabilities to small droplet dynamics, and allow a preliminary statistical spray analysis.},

The numerical study of such a problem is a great challenge for different reasons. Large density ratios, presence of a singular surface tension force, interface localization and transport, mass conservation, all of these make accurate numerical simulation difficult to perform. Several strategies have been investigated at ONERA in order to find an optimal method to simulate the atomization process with the CEDRE code. Both interface capturing and diffuse interface algorithms have been tested. The present development consists in the implementation of a multi-fluid version of the current gas solver of CEDRE, which conserves all its original features. One of the principal axes of research is based on a method which couples the new multi-fluid method with one of the dispersed phase solvers of CEDRE. The long term purpose is to be able to perform numerical simulation of both primary and secondary atomization.},
