  "abstract": "In this work, a conformable singular system with second-class constraints is discussed. The conformable Poisson bracket (CDB) of two functions is defined. and, the Dirac theory is developed to be applicable to conformable singular systems. In addition, to demonstrate the theory an illustrative example is given and solved, the results are found to be in agreement with ref \\cite{rabei1992hamilton} when $α=1$.",
