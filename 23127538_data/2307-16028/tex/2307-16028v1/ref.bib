	abstract = {Textbook treatments of classical mechanics typically assume that the Lagrangian is nonsingular; that is, the matrix of second derivatives of the Lagrangian with respect to the velocities is invertible. This assumption ensures that (i) Lagrange's equations can be solved for the accelerations as functions of coordinates and velocities, and (ii) the definitions of the conjugate momenta can be inverted to solve for the velocities as functions of coordinates and momenta. This assumption, however, is unnecessarily restrictive—there are interesting classical dynamical systems with singular Lagrangians. The algorithm for analyzing such systems was developed by Dirac and Bergmann in the 1950s. After a brief review of the Dirac–Bergmann algorithm, several examples are presented using familiar components: point masses connected by massless springs, rods, cords, and pulleys.},

	abstract = {The Dirac–Bergmann algorithm is a recipe for converting a theory with a singular Lagrangian into a constrained Hamiltonian system. Constrained Hamiltonian systems include gauge theories—general relativity, electromagnetism, Yang–Mills, string theory, etc. The Dirac–Bergmann algorithm is elegant but at the same time rather complicated. It consists of a large number of logical steps linked together by a subtle chain of reasoning. Examples of the Dirac–Bergmann algorithm found in the literature are designed to isolate and illustrate just one or two of those logical steps. In this paper, I analyze a finite-dimensional system that exhibits all of the major steps in the algorithm. The system includes primary and secondary constraints, first and second class constraints, restrictions on Lagrange multipliers, and both physical and gauge degrees of freedom. This relatively simple system provides a platform for discussing the Dirac conjecture, constructing Dirac brackets, and applying gauge conditions.},

The analytical expressions for energy spectra and wave functions are derived using a new algorithm of the conformable fractional Nikiforov-Uvarov method. The relationship between the conformable fractional spectra of the Kratzer potential and the spectrum of the Z(5) model is discussed. The evolution of the spectra in correspondence with the fractional derivative order and the potential parameters is investigated. The normalized calculated spectra and B(E2) transition rates are compared with the available experimental data and the existing theoretical predictions from various models.

The fractional-order dependence of the energy eigenvalues \$E\_n {\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}alpha\$ and eigenfunctions \${\textbackslash}psi\_n {\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}alpha\$ are obtained using using suitable transformations and the extended fractional Nikiforov-Uvarov method.
