  "abstract": "Kato's well known distributional inequality for the magnetic Laplacian holds equally in the more general setting of non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics (QED), where the wave function is vector-valued and the vector potential is quantized. We give two new applications of this result: First, we show that eigenstates satisfy a subsolution estimate. Second, for general states, with energy distribution strictly below the ionization threshold, we give a short proof of pointwise exponential decay in the electronic configuration.",
