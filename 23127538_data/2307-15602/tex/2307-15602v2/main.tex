\abstract{
Measurement of cosmic photons 
may reveal their propagation 
in the interstellar environment, 
thereby offering a promising way 
to probe axions and 
axion-like particles (ALPs). 
Numerical methods are usually used to compute 
the propagation of the photon-ALP beam due to 
the complexity of both the interstellar magnetic field 
and the evolution equation. 
However, under certain conditions, 
the evolution equation can be greatly simplified  
so that the photon-ALP propagation can  
be analytically solved. 
By using analytic methods, we find 
two distinct photon-ALP propagation modes, 
determined by the relative magnitude of the photon-ALP mixing term 
in comparison to the photon attenuation term.
In one mode, the intensity of photons decreases with the increasing distance; 
in the other mode, it also exhibits oscillatory behavior.
To distinguish the two propagation modes, 
we compute the observable quantities such as  
the photon survival probability 
and the degree of polarization.

\section{Introduction}



The existence of axions and axion-like particles (ALPs) is a topic of great interest in modern particle physics 
\cite{Ringwald:2012hr, Irastorza:2018dyq, Adams:2022pbo}. 
The QCD axion was 
initially proposed as a natural solution to the strong CP problem \cite{Peccei:1977hh,Wilczek:1977pj}. 
Recently, the study of ALPs has gained widespread attention due to the much wider range of mass and coupling parameter than the QCD axion \cite{Jaeckel:2010ni}. ALPs 
arise naturally in a plethora of extensions of the standard model, including supersymmetric models \cite{Chang:1999si,Turok:1995ai} and superstring theories \cite{Svrcek:2006yi,Ringwald:2008cu,Arvanitaki:2009fg}. 







The presence of ALPs can significantly alter photon propagation in the universe, leading to distinct photon-ALP oscillation signatures \cite{Maiani:1986md,Raffelt:1987im}.
Because of the complex astrophysical environment through which photon-ALP beams propagate,
most recent studies used numerical simulations to analyze their propagation properties; see e.g., \cite{Li:2020pcn,Horns:2012pp,Gill:2011yp,Bi:2020ths,Galanti:2022yxn,Galanti:2022tow,Xia:2019yud,Liang:2018mqm}. 
Nevertheless, there are also a number of analytical studies on the photon-ALP propagation, 
see e.g., \cite{Raffelt:1987im,Grossman:2002by,Csaki:2003ef,Lai:2006af,DeAngelis:2007dqd,Agarwal:2008ac,Ganguly:2008kh,Mirizzi:2009aj,Wang:2015dil,Kartavtsev:2016doq}. 
Although numerical simulations lead to more accurate results 
than analytical calculations, some 
physical phenomena that can be 
discerned in analytical calculations
are often obscure in numerical simulations.  
In this paper we use analytic methods 
to study the propagation of the photon-ALP beams. 
We find that under certain conditions the evolution equation of the photon-ALP beam 
can be significantly simplified so that analytic methods can be used. 
Our analytic methods reveal two distinct photon propagation modes, 
determined by the relative magnitude of the photon-ALP mixing term 
in comparison to the photon attenuation term.
More precisely, the two propagation modes are 
determined by the sign of the quantity $D$ 
given in Eq.~\eqref{2eq5}:  
in the $D>0$ case,
photons exhibit clear oscillations during the propagation;  
conversely, in the $D<0$ case, the oscillations are absent. 
We investigate the astrophysical conditions that lead to the emergence of these two propagation modes, and further study the implications for relevant physical observables such as the photon survival probability and degree of polarization. 
We study the distinguishing features of the two propagation modes in detail, 
which can be used to discriminate between the two modes, as well as against the standard model background.













The rest of paper is organized as follows. 
In section \ref{PE}, we introduce the ALPs and 
the propagation equation governing the photon-ALP system. 
In section \ref{TWO}, we introduce the two distinct photon propagation modes that are characterized by the sign of a quantity $D$. We compute the density matrix via analytic methods 
and further discuss the effects of ALPs on the density matrix. 
In sections \ref{sec:highE} and \ref{sec:lowE}, 
we discuss the physical observables such as the photon survival probability and the photon degree of polarization 
in the two propagation modes: 
We focus on photons with energies above 100 TeV 
in section \ref{sec:highE}, 
and photons with energies in the range of $10^{-3}-10^4$ GeV 
in section \ref{sec:lowE}. 
In section \ref{sec:conclusions}, we summarize our findings.
In the appendix, we compare our analytic method in which a uniform 
magnetic field is assumed, 
with numerical calculations in which magnetic field 
models that aim to describe the astrophysical conditions 
are used. 




















\section{Propagation equation}
\label{PE}



Consider the following effective interaction Lagrangian between the 
axion-like particle (ALP) $a$ and the photon
\begin{equation}
\label{lag}
\mathcal{L}_{\rm int}= 
-\frac{1}{4}g_{a\gamma}F^{\mu\nu}\tilde{F}_{\mu\nu}\, a
=g_{a\gamma}\mathbf{E}\cdot \mathbf{B} \, a,
\end{equation}
where $F^{\mu\nu}$ is the electromagnetic stress tensor and $\tilde{F}_{\mu\nu}$ is the dual, 
$\mathbf{E}$ and $\mathbf{B}$ are the electric and magnetic fields, respectively, 
and $g_{a\gamma}$ is the coupling constant.




 
The propagation of the photon-ALP beam along 
the $z$-direction with energy $\omega$
can be described by a three-component vector $\psi=(A_x,A_y,a)^T$, 
where $A_{x}$ and $A_{y}$ are the electromagnetic potentials linearly polarized 
along the $x$ and $y$ axes, respectively. 
Without loss of generality, we consider the case where the external magnetic field is along the 
$y$ direction and the equation that governs the propagation of $\psi$ is given by 
\cite{Raffelt:1987im,DeAngelis:2011id,Galanti:2022ijh},  
\begin{equation}
    \label{peq1}
    \left( i\frac{d}{dz} + \omega + \mathcal{M}\right)\psi=0,  
\end{equation}
where $\mathcal{M}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
    \label{peq10}
    \mathcal{M}=\begin{pmatrix}
    \Delta_x & 0 & 0\\
    0 & \Delta_y & \Delta_{a\gamma}\\
    0 & \Delta_{a\gamma} & \Delta_{aa}
    \end{pmatrix}+\frac{1}{2}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    i\Gamma & 0 & 0\\
    0 & i\Gamma & 0\\
    0 & 0 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}.
\end{equation}
Here, $\Delta_x$ and $\Delta_y$ describe the medium effects, 
$\Gamma$ is the absorption rate accounting for the attenuation of photons, 
$\Delta_{a\gamma}=g_{a\gamma}B/2$ is the photon-ALP mixing term 
with $B=|\boldsymbol{B}|$, 
and $\Delta_{aa}=-m_{a}^{2}/(2\omega)$ with $m_{a}$ being the ALP mass.
The absorption rate $\Gamma$ is mainly caused by the reaction $\gamma \gamma \to e^{+}e^{-}$ between the propagating photons and ambient photons, such as cosmic microwave background, extragalactic background light, and so on \cite{Vernetto:2016alq,Lipari:2018gzn}. As shown in the black line of Fig.\ (\ref{fig:delta}), $\Gamma$ becomes significant as energy $\omega \gtrsim 100$ TeV. 


The medium effects are given by 
\begin{equation}
\Delta_{x,y}= N \Delta_{\rm QED}+\Delta_{\rm pl}+\Delta_{\rm dis},     
\end{equation}
where 
$N=2$ $(7/2)$ for $\Delta_{x}$ ($\Delta_{y}$), 
$\Delta_{\rm QED}$ represents the QED birefringence, 
$\Delta_{\rm pl}$ represents the plasma effect, 
and $\Delta_{\rm dis}$ accounts for dispersion effects from photon-photon scattering on environmental radiation field 
\cite{Bi:2020ths,Galanti:2022yxn}. 
The plasma effect $\Delta_{\rm pl}$ is given by 
\begin{equation}
    \label{peq16}
    \Delta_{\rm pl}=-\frac{\omega_{\rm pl}^2}{2\omega}=-\frac{e^2n_e}{2m_e\omega},
\end{equation}
where $\omega_{\rm pl}$ is the plasma frequency, 
$e$ is the QED coupling, 
and $m_e$ and $n_e$ is the mass and number density of the electron, respectively.  
For the case of $\omega \lesssim 100\ \text{TeV}$, 
the QED birefringence and dispersion effects 
can be obtained from the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian~\cite{Dittrich:2000zu,Latorre:1994cv,Cougo-Pinto:1999agw,Tarrach:1983cb,Adler:1971wn} 
\begin{align}
    \Delta_{\rm QED}&=\frac{\alpha \omega}{45\pi}\left(\frac{Be}{m_e^2}\right)^2,    \label{peq13}\\
    \Delta_{\rm dis}&=\frac{44\alpha^2\rho_{\rm RF}\omega}{135m_e^4},\label{peq17} 
\end{align}
where $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant, 
and $\rho_{\rm RF}$ is the ambient photon energy density. 
For the high energy cosmic gamma-ray with $\omega \gtrsim \omega_2=100$ TeV, 
Euler-Heisenberg approximation breaks down, and one can 
use the a scaling function $g_2(\omega/\omega_2)$ to take into account the gamma-gamma scattering 
due to background photon\ \cite{Dobrynina:2014qba}. 
Thus, at photon energy $\omega \gtrsim \omega_2=100$ TeV, the quantities  
$\Delta_{\rm QED}$ and $\Delta_{\rm dis}$ are both modified to 
$\Delta_{\rm QED(dis)}g_2(\omega/\omega_2)$, 
as follows \cite{Dobrynina:2014qba}:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    g_2(u)&=\frac{15}{\pi^4}\int_{0}^{\infty}dx \frac{x^3}{e^x-1}g_1\left(u x \frac{30\zeta(3)}{\pi^4}\right),\\
    g_1(u)&=\frac{3}{8}\int^{+1}_{-1}d\mu (1-\mu)^2g_0\left(u\frac{1-\mu}{2}\right), \\
    g_0(u)&=\frac{45}{44}\int_{1}^{\infty}du'\frac{f(u')}{u'^2-u^2},\\
    f(u)&=\frac{4u(u+1)-2}{u^3}\ln (\sqrt{u}+\sqrt{u-1})-\frac{2(u+1)\sqrt{u-1}}{u^{5/2}}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}










Note that Eq.\ (\ref{peq1}) is similar to the Schr\"odinger equation if the coordinate $z$ is replaced by the time $t$ 
and $(\omega +{\cal M})$ is replaced by $-\mathcal{H}$,
where $\mathcal{H}$ denotes the Hamiltonian. 
Thus, analogous to solving the Schr\"odinger equation, one can also construct the transition matrix $U(z)=e^{i\mathcal{M}z}$ for the photon-ALP progapation.
For a more general case, one can
define the density matrix $\rho \equiv \psi\psi^{\dagger}$, 
which satisfies an equation similar to the Von Neumann equation,
\begin{equation}
    \label{peq3}
    i\frac{d}{dz}\rho=\rho\mathcal{M}^{\dagger}-\mathcal{M}\rho. 
\end{equation}
The solution can then be obtained via 
$\rho(z) = U(z) \rho_0 U(z)^\dagger$, 
where $\rho_0$ is the initial condition. 
In our analysis, we assume an unpolarized photon beam 
such that $\rho_0=\text{diag}(1/2,1/2,0)$.
The upper-left $2\times2$ submatrix of $\rho$, denoted as $\rho_\gamma$, 
can be parameterized as\ \cite{Kosowsky:1998mb}
\begin{equation}
    \label{peq5}
    \rho_{\gamma}=
    \begin{pmatrix}
    \rho_{x} & \rho_{xy}\\
    \rho_{xy}^{*} & \rho_{y}
    \end{pmatrix}
    =\frac{1}{2}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    I+Q & U-iV\\
    U+iV & I-Q
    \end{pmatrix}, 
\end{equation}
where $I$, $Q$, $U$, and $V$ are the Stokes parameters. The photon degree of polarization $\Pi_{L}$ is then given by\ \cite{defin}
\begin{equation}
    \label{peq6}
    \Pi_{L}=\frac{\sqrt{Q^2+U^2}}{I}. 
\end{equation}
The photon survival probability after propagation is given by  \cite{DeAngelis:2011id}
\begin{equation}
    \label{peq8}
    P_{\gamma \to \gamma}=\rho_{x}+\rho_{y}=I.
\end{equation}





\section{Two different propagation modes}
\label{TWO}



Although recent studies focused on numerical methods to 
solve the photon-ALP propagation, due to 
the complex medium effects and  
the magnetic fields in the astrophysical environments, 
there are instances where 
analytic calculations are good approximations to the photon propagation. 
In this section we first identify the conditions in which 
analytic methods to the photon propagation can be used. 
We then discuss two different propagation modes that are 
found in our analysis.

We will use the high-energy photons as the 
example in this section, though analytic methods 
can also be used for low-energy photons. 
We first consider the very high energy photons 
with $\omega \gtrsim 100$ TeV.
At such high energy, the matrix $\cal M$ can be greatly 
simplified, because the various $\Delta$ terms can be neglected 
except the new physics term $\Delta_{a\gamma}$ 
and the absorption term $\Gamma$, 
as shown in Fig.\ (\ref{fig:delta}),  
where $g_{a\gamma}=3\times 10^{-12}\ \text{GeV}^{-1}$ and $B=2\ \mu$G 
are assumed. 
Thus we have 
\begin{equation}
    \label{2eq1}
    \mathcal{M} \simeq \frac{1}{2}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    i\Gamma & 0 & 0\\
    0 & i\Gamma & g_{a\gamma}B\\
    0 & g_{a\gamma}B & 0
    \end{pmatrix}. 
\end{equation}
We further assume that the variation of external magnetic field is relatively small 
so that it can be approximated by a uniform magnetic field. 
In this case, one can then analytically solve the propagation. 
We note that the analytical solution can facilitate the calculations and 
can reveal some physics pictures of the problem 
that are difficult to be seen in the numerical calculations.

We then find that 
in the analytic solutions for the simplified $\cal M$, 
there exist two different propagation modes of photons,  
characterized 
by the sign of $D$, which is defined as 
\begin{equation}
    \label{2eq5}   
    D \equiv g_{a\gamma}^2B^2 - \frac{\Gamma^2}{4}. 
\end{equation}
We discuss these two propagation modes: 
$D>0$ and $D<0$ below. 



\subsection{The $D>0$ propagation mode}


We first discuss the $D>0$ case. 
To solve the propagation analytically, we first compute 
the transition matrix 
$U(z)=e^{i\mathcal{M}z}$, 
where $\mathcal{M}$ is given by Eq.\ \eqref{2eq1}.
Thus, for the $D>0$ case, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{upp}
U_{D>0}(z)=\frac{e^{-\frac{\Gamma}{4}z}}{\cos \varphi}
\begin{pmatrix}
e^{-\frac{\Gamma}{4}z}\cos{\varphi} & 0 & 0\\
0 & \cos \left(\varphi + \frac{\Delta}{2}z \right) & i\sin \frac{\Delta}{2}z \\

0 & i\sin \frac{\Delta}{2}z & \cos \left(\varphi - \frac{\Delta}{2}z \right)
\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
where we have defined  
$\Delta=\sqrt{D}$ and $\varphi=\arctan(\Gamma/(2\Delta))$. 
We then compute $\rho(z)$ at distance $z$ from the source via 
$\rho(z) = U(z) \rho_0 U(z)^\dagger$, 
where $\rho_0=\text{diag}(1/2,1/2,0)$ is initial condition  
for an unpolarized photon beam at the source.
The matrix elements of 
$\rho_\gamma(z)$ in this case are given by
\begin{align}
\label{AX1}
\rho_{x}(z) &=\frac{1}{2}e^{-\Gamma z},\\
\label{AY1}
\rho_{y}(z) & =\frac{1}{2} 
\frac{e^{-\frac{\Gamma}{2}z}}{\cos^2 \varphi} \cos^2 
\left(\varphi + \frac{\Delta}{2}z \right),\\
\rho_{xy} (z) &= 0.
\end{align}
Here $\rho_x(z)$ and $\rho_y(z)$ describe the 
intensities of photons polarized along $x$ and $y$ directions, respectively.  
Because the off-diagonal element 
$\rho_{xy} (z)$ vanishes in this case, 
the photon degree of polarization $\Pi_{L}$ 
becomes
\begin{equation}
    \Pi_L = \frac{|\rho_x - \rho_y|}{\rho_x + \rho_y}. 
    \label{eq:PiL}
\end{equation}




We note that the intensities of photons with polarization along the $x$ and $y$ directions exhibit different dependencies on the propagation distance $z$. 
We discuss the distinct behaviors below. 

First, the intensity of photons polarized along the $y$ 
direction depends both on the attenuation term $\Gamma$ 
and on the ALP-interaction term 
$\Delta_{a\gamma}$ (through $\Delta$ and $\varphi$), 
but the intensity along the $x$ 
direction depends on $\Gamma$ only. 
This discrepancy arises from the fact 
that the external magnetic field is taken 
to be along the $y$ direction 
so that photons polarized along 
the $x$ direction are not directly affected by the ALP.




Second, the intensity of photons polarized along the $x$ 
direction decreases exponentially as the distance $z$ increases, 
with a decay length of $L_d=\Gamma^{-1}$, 
as shown in Eq.\ \eqref{AX1}. 
On the other hand, the intensity for photons polarized along the $y$ direction  
appears to exhibit a longer decay length of $L_d=(\Gamma/2)^{-1}$
(twice of that along the $x$ direction), 
based solely on the argument of the exponential function in Eq.\ \eqref{AY1}. 
This change on the decay length is due to the fact that 
photons polarized along the $y$ direction can convert into 
ALPs that do not experience the photon attenuation effects 
$\Gamma$. 
We emphasize that the actual decay length 
for photons polarized along the $y$ direction will deviate 
somewhat from the value of $L_d=(\Gamma/2)^{-1}$ due to the 
additional $z$-dependence in Eq.\ \eqref{AY1}. 
Specifically, taking the limit $g_{a \gamma} \to 0$ in Eq.\ \eqref{AY1} 
introduces an additional exponential factor $e^{-(\Gamma/2) z}$, which must be taken into account. 
\footnote{Note that the $g_{a \gamma} \to 0$ limit is not allowed in the $D>0$ case. 
See more discussions in the $D<0$ case.} 





Third, 
the intensity of photons polarized along the $y$ direction, 
while propagating, exhibits an oscillatory behavior. 
We define the oscillation length, denoted by $L_o$, as 
the period of the absolute value of the cosine function 
in Eq.\ \eqref{AY1}. 
The oscillation length is given by
\begin{equation}
    L_o = \frac{2 \pi}{\Delta} = \frac{2 \pi}{\sqrt{g_{a \gamma}^2B^2-\left(\frac{\Gamma}{2}\right)^2}}.  
\end{equation}
Thus, the increase in the difference between $g_{a \gamma} B$ and $\Gamma$ leads to an increase in the oscillation length. We note that the oscillation is attenuated by the exponential factor $e^{-(\Gamma/2)z}$.














\subsection{The $D<0$ propagation mode}


We next discuss the $D<0$ case. 
For the case of $D<0$, the transition matrix $U(z)$ can be written as
\begin{equation}
\label{ump1}
U_{D<0}(z)=
\frac{e^{-\frac{\Gamma}{4}z}}{\cos 2\alpha}
\begin{pmatrix}
e^{-\frac{\Gamma}{4}z}\cos 2\alpha & 0 & 0\\
0 & e^{-\frac{\Delta}{2}z}\cos ^2 \alpha - e^{\frac{\Delta}{2}z}\sin ^2 \alpha & i \left(e^{\frac{\Delta}{2}z}-e^{-\frac{\Delta}{2}z}\right)\sin \alpha \cos \alpha \\
0 & i \left(e^{\frac{\Delta}{2}z}-e^{-\frac{\Delta}{2}z}\right)\sin \alpha \cos \alpha & e^{\frac{\Delta}{2}z}\cos ^2 \alpha - e^{-\frac{\Delta}{2}z}\sin ^2 \alpha
\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
where $\Delta=\sqrt{-D}$
and $\alpha=\arcsin {\sqrt{\Gamma/2-\Delta}}/{\sqrt{\Gamma}}$. 
\footnote{The definition of $\Delta$ in the $D<0$ case is different from the $D>0$ case.}

For an unpolarized photon beam at the source, 
the diagonal matrix elements of 
$\rho_\gamma(z)$ are given by
\begin{align}
\label{AX2}
\rho_{x}(z) &=\frac{1}{2}e^{-\Gamma z},\\
\label{AY2}
\rho_{y}(z) &=\frac{1}{2}\frac{e^{-\frac{\Gamma}{2}z}}{\cos^2 (2\alpha)}
e^{-{\Delta}z}
\left|\cos ^2 \alpha - e^{\Delta z}\sin ^2 \alpha \right|^2, \\
\rho_{xy} (z) &= 0. 
\end{align}


We note that both $\rho_{x}(z)$ and $\rho_{xy}(z)$ 
are the same as in the $D>0$ case. 
Similarly to the $D>0$ case, the vanishing off-diagonal element $\rho_{xy}(z)$ leads to a simplified expression of the photon 
as given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:PiL}. 
We next discuss the distinct dependencies on the 
propagation distance $z$ of the intensities of photons 
with polarization along the $x$ and $y$ directions, 
and also make comparison to the $D>0$ case.


First, photons polarized along the $x$ direction only 
undergo attenuation characterized 
by the photon attenuation coefficient $\Gamma$, 
whereas photons polarized along the $y$ direction  
are influenced both by $\Gamma$ 
and by the mixing term with the ALP. 
This is similar to the $D>0$ case.


Second, the ALP-photon mixing term weakens the photon attenuation. 
This can be seen from the argument of the exponential function 
in Eq.~\eqref{AY2}, 
which hints a decay length of $L_d = (\Gamma/2+\Delta)^{-1}$ 
for $y$-polarized photons. 
The decay length of $x$-polarized photons is $L_d = \Gamma^{-1}$. 
Since $\Delta < \Gamma/2$, 
photons polarized along the $y$-direction has a larger 
decay length than photons polarized along the $x$-direction. 
The reason behind this is the same as the $D>0$ case: 
when propagating, $y$-polarized photons can convert into ALPs 
which are unaffected by photons attenuation effects.



Third, in contrast to the $D>0$ scenario, where photons polarized in the $y$ direction exhibit oscillations, photons in the $D<0$ scenario do not exhibit any oscillatory behavior. 



\section{Propagation modes for high-energy photons with $\omega \geq 100$ TeV}
\label{sec:highE}



In this section, we discuss the propagation modes 
for photons with energy $\omega\geq 100$ TeV. 
We will adopt the value of the coupling constant $g_{a\gamma}=3\times10^{-12}$ GeV$^{-1}$ \cite{Irastorza:2021tdu} 
as the default value 
for all subsequent analyses, unless otherwise stated. 

In the Milky Way (MW) galaxy, 
the strength of the magnetic field is of 
$O(1)\ \mu$G \cite{Jansson:2012pc,Jansson:2012rt}. 
Taking $B=1\ \mu$G , we find that 
$B g_{a\gamma} \simeq 0.01$ kpc$^{-1}$; 
equating $B g_{a\gamma}$ with $\Gamma/2$ leads to 
the photon energy at $\sim 250$ TeV. 
Thus, the photon propagation mode is the $D<0$ mode 
for $\omega\gtrsim250$ TeV, 
and the $D>0$ mode for $\omega\lesssim 250$ TeV. 







For active galactic nuclei, galaxy clusters, and extragalactic space, the typical magnetic field strengths are $O(1-10^{5})\ \mu$G \cite{Pudritz:2012xj,Tavecchio:2009zb}, $O(1-10)\ \mu$G \cite{Govoni:2004as}, and $O(10^{-7}-1)$ nG \cite{Neronov:2010gir,Pshirkov:2015tua}, respectively. 
Because the magnetic field in active galactic nuclei 
and galaxy clusters is typically much larger than 
that in the MW galaxy, 
the propagation mode is expected to be $D>0$  
for photons with energy $\omega \geq 100$ TeV. \footnote{However, if the variation of external magnetic field is large, the mean value of $B$ may be very small and the propagation mode would be more similar to the $D<0$ mode. See Fig.\ (\ref{GC}) for details.}
On the other hand, the magnetic field in 
extragalactic space is much smaller than 
that in the MW galaxy, leading 
to the $D<0$ mode 
for photons with energy $\omega \geq 100$ TeV. 






We note that our general discussions here are not applicable in extreme environments where the magnitude of the magnetic field and/or electron number density is significantly large such that the terms $\Delta_{\rm QED}$ and/or $\Delta_{\rm pl}$ in the $\mathcal{M}$ matrix can become substantial.
















\subsection{The $D>0$ case}
\label{sec:Dpositive}





We first discuss the physics in the $D>0$ case. 
For the $D>0$ mode, we first compute 
the photon degree of polarization $\Pi_{L}$, 
which is given by Eq.\ \eqref{eq:PiL}, 
in the absence of the off-diagonal elements of the 
$\rho_\gamma$ matrix. 
Due to the interaction with the ALP, 
photons observed at Earth can be fully polarized, i.e., $\Pi_L=1$, 
in spite of the unpolarized initial condition at the source 
position. 
This is a remarkable signature for ALP detection. 
Thus, it is of great interest to determine under what conditions 
photons observed can be fully polarized. 
The nearly fully-polarized $\Pi_L \sim 1$ can be achieved 
in two cases: 
(1) $\rho_x \gg \rho_y$, 
(2) $\rho_x \ll \rho_y$. 



We first discuss the $\rho_x \gg \rho_y$ case. 
Since $\rho_x(z) > 0$, the full-polarization case $\Pi_L=1$ 
can be achieved if $\rho_y(z) = 0$; 
by using the analytic expression of $\rho_y(z)$ 
given in Eq.\ \eqref{AY1}, we obtain the $z$ values 
for $\Pi_L=1$:
\begin{equation}
    \label{z0L}
    z_n=\frac{2}{\Delta}\left[\frac{n-1}{2}\pi+\arctan\left( \frac{2\Delta}{\Gamma}\right)\right],
\end{equation}
where $n$ is a positive odd integer. 
Thus, the full-polarization $\Pi_L=1$ phenomena are  
evenly distributed in space, 
and the distance between adjacent $\Pi_L$ points  
is $2\pi/\Delta$. 
Because $\rho_x(z) > 0$ decreases with $z$, 
the detection should be performed with the 
smallest distance $z_1$ in Eq.\ \eqref{z0L}, 
if possible. 
Note that $z_1=2\arctan(2\Delta/\Gamma)/\Delta$
can be significantly small if 
$g_{a\gamma}B$ is sufficiently large.

Fig.\ (\ref{fig:DY0}) 
shows the photon polarization degree $\Pi_L$ 
as a function of the propagation distance $z$, 
where 
a constant external magnetic field $B=10\ \mu\text{G}$, 
the coupling constant $g_{a\gamma}=3\times 10^{-12}\ \text{GeV}^{-1}$, 
and the absorption rate $\Gamma=0.02\ \text{kpc}^{-1}$ 
(corresponding to $\omega \sim 250$ TeV)
are used. 
We note that in Fig.\ (\ref{fig:DY0}), 
$z_1 \simeq 31.8$ kpc, 
and the distance between adjacent peaks in the $\rho_x \gg \rho_y$ case 
is $2\pi/\Delta \simeq 68.3$ kpc.






We next discuss the $\rho_x \ll \rho_y$ case. 
Because the $y$-polarized photons have a longer 
decay length than the $x$-polarized photons, 
eventually $\rho_x$ can become much smaller 
than $\rho_y$, 
leading to a nearly full-polarization, 
$\Pi_L \simeq 1$. 
By using the 
analytic expressions given in 
Eq.\ \eqref{AX1}
and 
Eq.\ \eqref{AY1}, 
we obtain the maximum values of $\Pi_L$ 
in the $\rho_x \ll \rho_y$ case
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:piLmax2}
     \Pi_L^n = \tanh \left(\frac{\Gamma}{4}z_n\right), 
     \,\, \text{with} \,\,
     z_n = \frac{\pi n}{\Delta}, 
\end{equation}
where $n$ is a positive even integer. 
Unlike the $\rho_x \gg \rho_y$ case, 
where $\Pi_L=1$ can occur at relatively 
small distance, 
in the $\rho_x \ll \rho_y$ case, 
large $\Pi_L$ only occurs at large distance; 
for example, in Fig.\ (\ref{fig:DY0}), 
the maximum value of $\Pi_L$ 
in the $\rho_x \ll \rho_y$ case is rather 
small ($\Pi_L < 0.77$) until it reaches 
the third maximum point in this case, 
which is $z_6 = 6\pi/\Delta \simeq 205$ kpc.





We further extrapolate 
the maximum value of $\Pi_L$ on $z_n$, 
as given in Eq.\ \eqref{eq:piLmax2}, 
to all $z$ values,
\begin{equation}
   \label{AppPi}
    \Pi_L = \tanh \left(\frac{\Gamma}{4}z\right),
\end{equation}
which can be interpreted as the theoretical upper 
bound of $\Pi_L$, as 
shown in Fig.\ (\ref{fig:DY0}). 
It is interesting to note that Eq.\ \eqref{AppPi} 
is independent of the external magnetic field. 











We further discuss the photon survival probability.  
Fig.\ (\ref{fig:DY0}) shows the photon survival probability 
$P_{\gamma\to\gamma}$ as a function of 
the propagation distance $z$, for the same 
parameters as in Fig.\ (\ref{fig:DY0}). 
Because of the attenuation term $\Gamma$, 
the photon survival probability decreases 
with the propagation distance. 
Moreover, the presence of the ALP 
results in an oscillatory behavior in the photon survival probability. 
The photon survival probability $P_{\gamma\to\gamma}$ 
is bounded from above by 
$P_{\gamma\to\gamma} < (e^{-\Gamma z}+e^{-\Gamma z/2}/\cos \phi)/2$, 
which is larger than the case without ALP, 
$P_{\gamma\to\gamma}=e^{-\Gamma z}$. 
Thus, the presence of ALP makes distant 
galaxies brighter, resulting in a better detection probability. 




As shown in Fig.\ (\ref{fig:DY0}), 
$\Pi_L \sim 1$ can occur at large $z$ values 
both in the $\rho_x \gg \rho_y$ case 
(odd-numbered peaks)
and in the $\rho_x \ll \rho_y$ case
(even-numbered peaks). 
However, as shown in 
Fig.\ (\ref{fig:DY0}), 
the photon survival probability 
at odd-numbered peaks can be several-order-of-magnitude 
smaller 
than the adjacent even-numbered peaks 
at large $z$ values. 
Thus, 
photons emitted from a distant source are  
likely to be observed  
in the $\rho_x \ll \rho_y$ case than 
the $\rho_x \gg \rho_y$ case. 


\subsection{The $D<0$ case}
\label{sec:Dnegative}



% Figure environment removed


We next discuss the physics in the 
$D<0$ case. 
The left panel figure of 
Fig.\ (\ref{fig:poldeg3}) shows 
the degree of polarization $\Pi_{L}$, in the $D<0$ case, 
as a function of the propagation distance $z$, 
where 
a constant external magnetic field 
$B=2\ \mu\text{G}$, 
$g_{a\gamma}=3\times 10^{-12}\ \text{GeV}^{-1}$, 
and $\Gamma=0.1\ \text{kpc}^{-1}$ are used.
Similarly to the $D>0$ propagation mode, 
the nearly fully-polarized $\Pi_L \sim 1$ 
in the $D<0$ propagation mode can be also achieved 
in two cases: 
(1) $\rho_x \gg \rho_y$, 
(2) $\rho_x \ll \rho_y$. 



We first discuss the $\rho_x \gg \rho_y$ case. 
In this case, 
the full-polarization cases $\Pi_L=1$ 
occurs when $\rho_y(z) = 0$, since  $\rho_x(z) > 0$. 
Unlike the infinite $z$ values for $\rho_y(z) = 0$ in the 
$D>0$ case, there is only a single point 
for $\rho_y(z) = 0$ in the $D<0$ case. 
By using the analytic expression of $\rho_y(z)$ 
in Eq.\ \eqref{AY2}, we obtain the single $z$ value 
for $\rho_y(z) = 0$ as
\begin{equation}
\label{z0s}
z_0=\frac{1}{\Delta}\ln{ \frac{\Gamma+2\Delta}{\Gamma-2\Delta}=\frac{2}{\sqrt{\left(\frac{\Gamma}{2}\right)^2-g_{a\gamma}^2B^2}}\ln{\frac{\frac{\Gamma}{2}+\sqrt{\left(\frac{\Gamma}{2}\right)^2-g_{a\gamma}^2B^2}}{g_{a\gamma}B}}}. 
\end{equation}
In Fig.\ (\ref{fig:poldeg3}), one has that $z_0 \simeq 71$ kpc, 
which is the first point where the full-polarization cases $\Pi_L$ reaches one. 



We next discuss the $\rho_x \ll \rho_y$ case. 
Because the $y$-polarized photons have a longer 
decay length than the $x$-polarized photons, 
eventually $\rho_x$ can become much smaller 
than $\rho_y$, 
leading to a nearly full-polarization, 
$\Pi_L \simeq 1$. 
This occurs 
at a relatively large $z$ value. 
Note that $\rho_y$ has a local maximal point 
at $z = 2 z_0$. 
Thus, we take the $z \gtrsim 2 z_0$ as 
the region for the nearly full-polarization, 
$\Pi_L \simeq 1$. 
In Fig.\ (\ref{fig:poldeg3}), 
the nearly full-polarization, 
$\Pi_L \simeq 1$ occurs at 
$z \gtrsim 2 z_0 \simeq 140$ kpc. 




The right panel figure of Fig.\ (\ref{fig:poldeg3}) shows 
the photon survival probability $P_{\gamma\to\gamma}$, 
in the $D<0$ case. 
Unlike the $D>0$ case, here $P_{\gamma\to\gamma}$ does 
not oscillate with the propagation distance $z$. 
Nevertheless, the presence of ALPs can still facilitate 
the detection of remote photons more effectively than 
in the absence of ALPs.






We next investigate the optimal conditions 
for observing polarization signals 
in the $D<0$ propagation mode. 
In order to observe a distinct polarization signature with a 
strong signal strength, two conditions must be met. 
Firstly, the degree of polarization should be close to one, 
namely $\Pi_{L}\approx 1$. 
This condition can be achieved either at $z\simeq z_0$
or at $z \geq 2 z_0$. 
Secondly, the total intensity of photons should be significant, 
which implies a significant photon survival probability 
$P_{\gamma\to\gamma}=\rho_x+\rho_y$.  
Since $\rho_x(z)$ decreases with increasing $z$, 
observation at $z=z_0$ should be perused as the first option. 




We next study the $z \geq z_0$ region. 
In this region, 
while the intensity $\rho_x(z)$ continues to decrease with increasing $z$, 
the intensity $\rho_y(z)$ starts to grow 
from zero at $z=z_0$ to its local maximum point at $z=2z_0$, 
and then decreases with increasing $z$. 
Therefore, the maximum value of the photon survival probability 
in the $z \geq z_0$ region 
should occur in the interval of $z_0 \leq z \leq 2z_0$; 
within this interval, 
the maximum value of $\rho_x$ is $e^{-\Gamma z_0}/2$ 
at $z=z_0$, which is the same as the maximum value of $\rho_y$ 
at $z= 2 z_0$. 
The theoretical upper bound on the photon survival probability 
can be obtained by simply summing these two maximum values, 
leading to $P_{\gamma \to \gamma} < e^{-\Gamma z_0}$. 
\footnote{The upper bound on the photon survival probability 
obtained in this way is larger than or equal to its maximum value.} 
We next study the possible maximum value of the 
above upper bound. 
By using Eq.\ (\ref{z0s}), we have
$
 \Gamma z_0=2x\ln[(x+1)/(x-1)],
$
where $x \equiv {\Gamma}/(2\Delta)\geq1$. 
When $x\to\infty$, the quantity $\Gamma z_0$ 
reaches its minimum value, which is 4. 
This can be achieved by 
setting $\Delta = 0$, which arises if $\Gamma/2=g_{a\gamma}B$. 
This then leads to a maximum value   
for the upper bound on the photon survival probability 
$P_{\gamma\to\gamma} < e^{-4} \simeq 1.8\%$. 




Therefore, for $D<0$ propagation mode, 
the observations on the 
degree of polarization $\Pi_L$ should be first conducted 
at the distance of $z \simeq z_0$ and $z \simeq 2 z_0$. 
The theoretical upper bound on the photon 
survival probability in the $z \geq z_0$ region is 
$\simeq 1.8\%$. 
We note that this upper bound can be somewhat larger 
than the actual maximum value of the photon 
survival probability in this region; 
for example, the photon 
survival probability is $\lesssim 0.04\%$ 
in the $z \geq z_0$ region for the model parameters 
on Fig.\ (\ref{fig:poldeg3}).

In Fig.\ (\ref{OE}), 
we further compare the theoretical upper bound on the photon 
survival probability in the $z \geq z_0$ region, 
which is $P_{\gamma\to\gamma} < 1.8\%$, to the 
actual calculations where different medium effects and 
varying magnetic fields are taken into consideration.
We find that in the energy range where the photon 
polarization $\Pi_L \approx 1$, 
which is $\omega \gtrsim 20$ TeV ($\omega \gtrsim 1$ TeV) 
on the left (right) panel figure of Fig.\ (\ref{OE}), 
the photon survival probability is indeed below $1.8\%$.








\section{Propagation modes for photons with energy $\omega = 10^{-3}-10^4$ GeV}
\label{sec:lowE}



In this section, we discuss the propagation modes 
for photons with with energy $\omega = 10^{-3}-10^4$ GeV. 
In this energy range, 
as compared to 
the ALP-photon mixing term, 
the quantity $\Gamma$ can also be considered negligible,  
in addition to the $\Delta_{x}$ and $\Delta_{y}$ terms, 
which are considered to be negligible in section \ref{TWO}.  
Thus our analytical analysis carried out in 
section \ref{TWO} is still valid and can be 
further simplified by taking the $\Gamma \to 0$ limit. 
In section \ref{TWO} we have neglected the ALP mass term. 
In this section we also study the effects of the 
ALP mass term. 





We first discuss the case where the ALP mass term is neglected. 
In this case, we take the $\Gamma \to 0$ limit in 
Eqs.~(\ref{AX1}) and (\ref{AY1}), which lead to 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:massless:rhox}
&\rho_x(z)=\frac{1}{2}, \\
&\rho_y(z)= \frac{1}{2} \cos^2 \left( \frac{g_{a\gamma}Bz}{2} \right). 
\label{eq:massless:rhoy}
\end{align}
Thus, both $\rho_x(z)$ and $\rho_y(z)$ are independent on energy, 
which also result in energy-independence of the photon survival 
probability $P_{\gamma \to \gamma }$ and 
the photon degree of polarization $\Pi_{L}$. 






% Figure environment removed



We next discuss the case where the ALP mass term is important. 
We consider the case where $m_a=10^{-10}\ \text{eV}$. 
In this case, we have $\rho_x(z)=1/2$. 
The analytical form of $\rho_y(z)$ can be obtained by replacing 
$\Gamma$ in Eq.\ (\ref{AY1}) with $2i\Delta_{aa}=-im_a^2/\omega$.
Thus, we have 
\begin{equation}
\label{AYD4}
\rho_y(z)=\frac{1}{2}\left|\cos \left(\frac{\Delta}{2}z\right)+i\frac{\Delta_{aa}}{\Delta}\sin \left(\frac{\Delta}{2}z\right)\right|^2,
\end{equation}
where $\Delta=\sqrt{g_{a\gamma}^2B^2+m_a^4/(4\omega^2)}$. 
We further compute the photon survival probability $P_{\gamma\to\gamma}$ and 
the polarization degree $\Pi_{L}$ 
by $P_{\gamma\to\gamma}=1/2+\rho_y$ and 
\begin{equation}
\Pi_{L}=\frac{1-2\rho_y}{1+2\rho_y}
= (P_{\gamma\to\gamma})^{-1}-1. 
\end{equation} 
Thus, the polarization degree is solely determined by 
the photon survival probability $P_{\gamma\to\gamma}$. 




Fig.\ (\ref{BD1}) shows 
the relation between the photon survival probability $P_{\gamma\to\gamma}$ 
and the photon energy $\omega$. 
Interestingly, we find that there exist two 
energy regions where the photon survival probability 
$P_{\gamma\to\gamma}$ is (nearly) independent of the photon energy: 
(1) $\omega \lesssim 1$ MeV, 
(2) $\omega \gtrsim 300$ MeV. 
This can be understood as follows. 
If the photon energy $\omega$ is high such that 
the term $\Delta_{aa}=-m_a^2/(2\omega)$ 
can be neglected, this is just the case 
where the ALP mass can be neglected. 
Thus one should have energy-independent 
$\rho_x$ and $\rho_y$, as given in 
Eqs.~\eqref{eq:massless:rhox} 
and \eqref{eq:massless:rhoy}, 
resulting in energy-independence in $P_{\gamma\to\gamma}$ 
for $\omega \gtrsim 300$ MeV in Fig.\ (\ref{BD1}). 
If the photon energy is low such that 
$\Delta_{aa}/\Delta \to 1$, 
we have $\rho_y\to1/2$. 
This then leads to $P_{\gamma\to\gamma} \approx 1$ 
for $\omega \lesssim 1$ MeV in Fig.\ (\ref{BD1}). 




The measurement of photon polarization degree can be carried out in the energy range of $10^{-1}-10^{4}\ \text{MeV}$ through advanced gamma-ray detectors, such as COSI\ \cite{COSI}, e-ASTROGAM\ \cite{Kawata:2017zyo,e-ASTROGAM:2018jlu}, and AMEGO\ \cite{Kierans:2020otl}, in the upcoming future.
We note that the polarization degree, $\Pi_{L}$, can be indirectly determined using the relation $\Pi_{L}=(1/P_{\gamma\to\gamma}-1)$.
Additionally, due to the photon-ALP interaction, 
the photon energy spectrum can exhibit a distinct oscillatory pattern 
sandwiched between two almost energy-independent regions, 
as illustrated in Fig.\ (\ref{BD1}), 
which may serve as a novel signature for the ALP detection.












\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}



In this paper we have identified two distinct photon propagation modes in the presence of ALPs. We classify the two different modes by the sign of $D= (g_{a \gamma} B)^2 - \Gamma^2/4$. For the $D>0$ propagation mode, the intensity of photon oscillates as propagating, producing multiple peaks along its propagation path. For the $D<0$ case, on the contrary, the intensity of photon does not exhibit any oscillatory behavior. 



We use analytic methods to study the two photon propagation modes, because they are not readily discernible in numerical simulations, which have been extensively used in the literature to model the photon-ALP propagation.  
In our analytic methods, we assume a uniform magnetic field and negligible medium effects so that the propagation equation of the photon-ALP system can be solved 
in a simple analytic form. 



We investigate photon propagation in two energy regions where our analytic methods are appropriate: (1) photon with energy $\gtrsim 100$ TeV; (2) photon in the energy range of $10^{-3}-10^4$ GeV. We identify the two photon propagation modes by comparing the magnetic field and the photon attenuation rate $\Gamma$ in different astrophysical environments. For the two propagation modes, We compute the photon survival probability $P_{\gamma \to \gamma}$ and the degree of photon polarization $\Pi_L$. 


In the $D>0$ propagation mode of photons with energy $\gtrsim 100$ TeV, 
the fully-polarization can occur 
either in the $\rho_x\ll \rho_y$ case or in the $\rho_y\ll \rho_x$ case. 
Because of the oscillatory behavior in the intensity, 
the fully-polarization exhibits as 
various peaks in the propagation distance. 
In the $D<0$ propagation mode of photons with energy $\gtrsim 100$ TeV, 
there is no oscillation in the photon intensity. 
The detection condition that yields optimal results should include both a 
a nearly full-polarization signal and a considerable photon survival probability. 
The distances at which this condition is met in the $D<0$ case 
are $z \simeq z_0$ and $z \simeq 2z_0$, 
where $z_0$ is defined in Eq.~\eqref{z0s}.
We further find an upper bound on the photon survival probability, 
$\simeq 1.8$ \%, for the full-polarization region, $\Pi_L \approx 1$. 


In the energy interval of $10^{-3}< \omega < 10^{4}$ GeV, 
both medium and attenuation effects can become 
small compared to the ALP-photon mixing term, 
leading to even simpler analytic results. 
In this energy range, the propagation mode is predominately 
the $D>0$ mode in most of the parameter space of interest. 
We further find some distinguishing signatures associated 
with the ALP mass $m_a$: 
If $m_a\simeq0$, 
both $P_{\gamma\to\gamma}$ and $\Pi_{L}$ 
are energy-independent; 
If $m_a$ cannot be neglected, there exist two 
energy-independent regions separated by an oscilating pattern 
in the energy spectrum of $P_{\gamma \to \gamma}$ and $\Pi_{L}$, 
which may serve as a novel signature to 
detect ALPs in the future experiments.

\section{Comparison between analytic and numerical calculations}


In this section we compare analytic calculations 
based on a uniform magnetic field assumption, 
with the numerical calculations using 
a more realistic consideration of the 
magnetic field, both in the MW galaxy 
and in galaxy clusters.





\subsection{MW galaxy}


We first discuss the photon propagation in the MW galaxy.
We adopt the MW magnetic field model given in 
Refs.~\cite{Jansson:2012pc,Jansson:2012rt}, 
in which the magnetic field consists of two components: 
the regular component 
and the random component. 
Following Ref.~\cite{Bi:2020ths}, 
we neglect the random fields in our analysis. 
For completeness, we present the regular component of 
the MW magnetic field from Refs.~\cite{Jansson:2012pc,Jansson:2012rt} 
in Table \ref{MKM}.







\begin{table}[htbp]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|c|cccccccc|}

\hline

      $i$ & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7\\

   $r_{xi}$ (kpc) & 5.1  &  6.3 & 7.1 & 8.3 & 9.8 & 11.4 & 12.7 & 15.5    \\
\hline
   $b_i$ ($\mu$G)  &  &   0.1 & 3.0 & -0.9 & -0.8 & -2.0 & -4.2 & 0 \\

  

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{The regular component of the 
magnetic field model in the MW disk \cite{Jansson:2012pc}.
The disk is partitioned into 7 regions with 
8 boundaries that are given by 
$r_i=r_{xi} \exp(\phi \tan(90^\circ-\beta))$, 
where $\beta=11.5^{\circ}$; 
the $i$-th region is bounded by 
the two curves $r_{i-1}$ and $r_{i}$. 
The coordinates $(r,\phi)$ are defined such that 
the Galactic center is (0,0) and 
the Sun is (-8.5 kpc, 0). 
The direction of the regular component is 
$\hat{b}=\sin(\beta)\hat{r}+\cos(\beta)\hat{\phi}$; 
the magnitude of the regular component 
in the $i$-th region
is given by 
$B=b_i {r_0}/{r}$ where $r_0=5$ kpc.}
\label{MKM}
\end{table}

We consider a source in the direction of 
$(\ell,b) = (180^\circ,0^\circ)$ 
(the opposite direction of GC) 
and with a distance of 4 kpc from Earth. 
In our analytic calculation
we use $B_0=0.98\ \mu$G,
which is the average value of the magnitude of the 
magnetic field along the propagation path.
Fig.~(\ref{MK}) shows the 
the polarization degree and survival probability, 
computed both in the analytic calculations 
and in the numerical calculations 
where the medium effects and the MW magnetic 
field model are used. 
The agreements between the analytic and numerical 
calculations indicate that the analytic calculation 
with a uniform magnetic field is a good approximation.

\subsection{Galaxy clusters}

We next discuss galaxy clusters. 
To model the complex magnetic field in galaxy clusters, 
we use the parametrization given in Refs.~\cite{Galanti:2022yxn,Bonafede:2010xg}
\begin{equation}
\label{BcluS}
B_{\rm clu}(z)=B_{\rm clu 0}
\left( 1+\frac{z^2}{r_{\rm core}^2} 
\right)^{-\frac{3}{2}\eta \beta}. 
\end{equation}
For galaxy clusters, we adopt the following parameters:
$B_{\rm clu0}=15$ $\mu$G, $r_{\rm core}=100$ kpc, $\beta=2/3$, and $\eta=0.75$ \cite{Galanti:2022yxn}. 
Following Ref.~\cite{Bonafede:2010xg}, 
we assume that the direction of the 
magnetic field is random; 
hence, we simulate the magnetic field direction by 
using Monte Carlo method with a step of 1 kpc along 
the propagation path. 
Fig.~(\ref{Bclu}) shows the simulated magnetic fields in 
the $x$- (left) and $y$- (right) directions in the galaxy cluster as a function of propagation distance $z$.







We obtain the mean value of the magnetic field in the galaxy cluster 
by taking the average of the magnetic field along the propagation 
path. 
In our simulation, we obtain $B_0=0.19\ \mu$G, 
which is the average of the magnetic field 
from $z=0$ to $z=500$ kpc. 
Fig.~(\ref{GC}) shows the 
the polarization degree and survival probability, 
computed both in the analytic calculations 
and in the numerical calculations 
where the medium effects are considered 
and the magnetic 
field model given in Eq.~\eqref{BcluS} is used. 
We note that although the analytic calculation 
deviates from the numerical calculation, 
it describes the behavior qualitatively 
and provide valuable insights for ALP effects.
