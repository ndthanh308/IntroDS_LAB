  "abstract": "In our article [arXiv:1511.05226], we studied the commutant $\\mathcal{C}'\\subset \\operatorname{Bim}(R)$ of a unitary fusion category $\\mathcal{C}$, where $R$ is a hyperfinite factor of type $\\rm II_1$, $\\rm II_\\infty$, or $\\rm III_1$, and showed that it is a bicommutant category. In other recent work [arXiv:1607.06041, arXiv:2301.11114] we introduced the notion of a (unitary) anchored planar algebra in a (unitary) braided pivotal category $\\mathcal{D}$, and showed that they classify (unitary) module tensor categories for $\\mathcal{D}$ equipped with a distinguished object.\n  Here, we connect these two notions and show that finite depth objects of $\\mathcal{C}'$ are classified by connected finite depth unitary anchored planar algebras in $\\mathcal{Z}(\\mathcal{C})$. This extends the classification of finite depth objects of $\\operatorname{Bim}(R)$ by connected finite depth unitary planar algebras.",
