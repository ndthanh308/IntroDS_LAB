Among the isomorphous members of the calcite, dolomite, and aragonite groups, a noteworthy shift of absorption bands takes place with longer wave lengths corresponding to an increase in cation radius or mass. The spectral difference between the more common groups may be related to crystal structure. The spectral relationships among the minerals of several groups are not well known, due to the complicated composition and crystal structure. Infrarecl active groups of CO:, HCOr, HrO, OH, and SOr dominate the absorption characteristics.},

The important role played by degeneracy of the optical modes is illustrated. These selection rules are important for SBS-based device design and for a full understanding the physics of SBS in structured waveguides.},

abstract = {This article discusses two measurement techniques for temperature determination of laser-induced plasmas in a gas at pressures relevant for combustion engines. Plasmas induced by laser breakdown in air at initial pressures ranging from 0.3 MPa to 2.5 MPa are investigated using optical spectroscopy. Results for 0.8 MPa, 1.2 MPa and 1.6 MPa are reported here. Due to the elevated pressure, a significant contribution from continuum radiation is apparent. The first temperature measurement technique relies on the interpretation of the continuum emission. The second technique is based on the line emissions from different elements and ionization stages in the plasma and is implemented with the multi-element Saha-Boltzmann plot method. The methodology may be applicable for temperature measurements under various conditions, e.g., for plasmas in high pressure gas environments such as in industrial applications of laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy or for plasma sources for illumination purposes. We investigate optimizations of laser-induced spark ignition. The energy released in the laser-induced plasma is determined based on temperature measurements. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The possibilities of fabricating active devices, such as fiber amplifiers and lasers, are presented.

Pump-probe crossed-Nicols imaging and elastic simulation elucidate that shear stresses and tensile stresses are concentrated in specific regions during the propagation of the stress wave. The shear stresses and tensile stresses observed in this study can explain the characteristic laser-induced structural changes inside rock-salt crystals.},

A polished or compressed disc of the sample was in contact with rhenium foil and heated by conduction. Melting was determined by plotting laser power/sample temperature function and looking for the thermal anomaly associated with the fusion of materials. All these solids were found to be highly refractory, requiring quite high temperatures for melting at the lower mantle pressures. The experimental melting results showed that for these minerals, melting temperatures increased with increasing pressure. Our results at low pressures are consistent with the data determined by other techniques (piston-cylinder, multianvils). The high-pressure melting of MgSiO3 perovskite agreed with the recent measurements by Zerr and Boehler (1993) within experimental uncertainties. Melting temperatures and melting slopes of CaSiO3 and Mg3Al2Si3O12 perovskites were found to be less than those of MgSiO3 perovskite, indicating that the presence of Ca and Al would decrease the melting temperatures of MgSiO3 perovskite in the Earth's lower mantle and that this effect will increase with increasing pressures. Melting temperature measurements on stishovite and corundum to pressures of 36 GPa and 25 GPa, respectively, are reported.},

abstract = {Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) is an analytical technique that measures the change in
 kinetic energy of electrons after they have interacted with a specimen. When carried out in a modern
 transmission electron microscope, EELS is capable of giving structural and chemical information
 about a solid, with a spatial resolution down to the atomic level in favourable cases. The energy
 resolution is typically 1 eV but can approach 0.1 eV if an electron-beam monochromator is used. This
 review provides an overview of EELS instrumentation and of the physics involved in the scattering of
 kilovolt electrons in solids. Features of the energy-loss spectrum are discussed, including plasmon
 peaks, inner-shell ionization edges and fine structure related to the electronic densities of
 states. Examples are given of the use of EELS for the measurement of local properties, including
 specimen thickness, mechanical and electronic properties (such as bandgap) and chemical composition.
 Factors that determine the spatial resolution of the analysis are outlined, including radiation
 damage to the specimen. Comparisons are made with related techniques, particularly x-ray absorption
 spectroscopy.},

By means of the procedure, some sample nanofluids are prepared. Their TEM photographs are given to illustrate the stability and evenness of suspension. The theoretical study of the thermal conductivity of nanofluids is introduced. The hot-wire apparatus is used to measure the thermal conductivity of nanofluids with suspended copper nanophase powders. Some factors such as the volume fraction, dimensions, shapes and properties of the nanoparticles are discussed. A theoretical model is proposed to describe heat transfer performance of the nanofluid flowing in a tube, with accounting for dispersion of solid particles. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Inc.

abstract = {The past decade has witnessed intensive research efforts related to the design and fabrication of photonic crystals. These periodically structured dielectric materials can represent the optical analogue of semiconductor crystals, and provide a novel platform for the realization of integrated photonics. Despite intensive efforts, inexpensive fabrication techniques for large-scale three-dimensional photonic crystals of high enough quality, with photonic bandgaps at near-infrared frequencies, and built-in functional elements for telecommunication applications, have been elusive. Direct laser writing by multiphoton polymerization of a photoresist has emerged as a technique for the rapid, cheap and flexible fabrication of nanostructures for photonics. In 1999, so-called layer-by-layer or woodpile photonic crystals were fabricated with a fundamental stop band at 3.9 microm wavelength. In 2002, a corresponding 1.9 microm was achieved, but the important face-centred-cubic (f.c.c.) symmetry was abandoned. Importantly, fundamental stop bands or photonic bandgaps at telecommunication wavelengths have not been demonstrated. In this letter, we report the fabrication--through direct laser writing--and detailed characterization of high-quality large-scale f.c.c. layer-by-layer structures, with fundamental stop bands ranging from 1.3 to 1.7 microm.},

abstract = {Lasers are expected to provide a less expensive alternative to conventional machining and have found wide spread use in many industries. However, the physical phenomena involved in many laser applications are not fully understood. A better and more quantitative understanding of the physical mechanisms governing these phenomena will diminish the need for extensive trial and error experiments. Most of the theoretical models available in the literature have dealt with quasi-steady material removal using a continuous wave laser. This article presents a numerical model to predict the transient thermal behavior process of rocks under the influence of a pulsed laser. A wide range of parameters were considered in this study, the laser powers were varied from 0.1 to 100kW and the lasing time was varied between 1 and 100 s. One of the results presented in this article shows that limestones consume less energy per unit volume of material removed as compared to sandstones. A comparison between the findings of this numerical study and published experimental data is also presented and shows a qualitative agreement. Finally, it is shown that numerical modeling can be useful in scaling up laboratory results to field applications.},

Applying this method to a silicon periodic waveguide suspended in air, we demonstrate that SBS nonlinearity can be dramatically enhanced at the brillouin zone boundary where the decreased group velocity of light magnifies photon-phonon interaction. In addition, we show that the symmetry plane perpendicular to the propagation axis plays an important role in both forward and backward SBS processes. In forward SBS, only elastic modes which are even about this plane are excitable. In backward SBS, the SBS gain coefficients of elastic modes approach to either infinity or constants, depending on their symmetry about this plane at {\$}q=0{\$}.},

The change in energy and propagation direction of the electron reveals the creation of a photon, with the photon energy directly read from the energy-loss spectrum or the beam displacement. Our study demonstrates the viability of deterministically creating single guided photons using electron beams with better than picosecond time uncertainty, thus opening a new avenue for making room temperature, heralded frequency-tunable sources affordable for scientific and commercial developments.},

abstract = {A theoretical model is presented which describes time dependent charging phenomena in insulators irradiated by an electron beam. This so called dynamic double layer model (DDM) is based on the simplified assumption of charge development in two axi‐symmetric cylindrical volumes at the insulator surface and at a certain depth below the surface, respectively. Important physical interaction mechanisms like the electrostatic interaction between the surface potential and emitted secondary electrons, the transport characteristics of internally generated secondary electrons in a positively charged insulator surface, as well as radiation induced electrical conductivity are included in the DDM model. Experimentally determined stationary and time dependent charging behaviour of Al2O3 single crystals (sapphire) irradiated with an electron beam between 1 and 15 keV energy can be qualitatively explained by the DDM model. {\textcopyright} 1995 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Publisher Summary Thermal diffusivities of rock/fluid systems need to be known for calculations involving transient heating or cooling operations. This chapter describes some experimental methods for measurement of thermal diffusivities of rock/fluid systems and compares the results of measurements. Thermal diffusivity may be measured by transient heat flow tests or it may be calculated from known values of thermal conductivity, heat capacity, and bulk density. The Boozer method involves heating a cylindrical rock test specimen at a constant heating rate at the outside circumference and recording the temperature difference between the outer radius and the center of the test specimen. The difficulties inherent in measuring thermal diffusivity, particularly in liquid-saturated rocks, indicate that calculation of thermal diffusivity may be the better approach. Heat capacity can be calculated either from a mineral analysis or a chemical analysis expressed in terms of oxides.},

The results obtained show a significant improvement but still show small discrepancies with respect to optical data, which are most likely due to the residual retardation contributions and the fact that nonzero momentum transfers are measured.},

abstract = {The electrical currents and potentials produced in pipes of intermediate and very high resistivities, by the flow of a charged liquid hydrocarbon have been investigated. The maximum pipe currents to the ground were in the range 1 to 6 microamperes. Depending upon the electrical resistance of the pipes, these currents produced potentials ranging from essentially zero to values in excess of 30,000 volts which were sufficiently severe to cause electrical breakdown and arcs within some of the pipes under investigation. It is concluded that hazardous pipe potentials, resulting from static electricity, can be eliminated in practical applications if the electrical resistance from each and any portion of the interior surface of the pipe to the ground does not exceed about 10{\^{}}7 ohms.},

@article{Pimienta2014,
abstract = {While knowledge on Thermal Conductivity (TC) of rocks is of interest in many fields, determining this property remains challenging. In this paper, a modelling approach for TC prediction from Elastic Wave Velocity (EWV) measurements is reported. To this end, a new effective TC model for a typical sedimentary rock is introduced that explicitly accounts for the presence of pores, pressure-sensitive microcracks (or grain contacts) and formation fluids. A model of effective elasticity is also devised for this same rock that links its microstructural characteristics to the velocity of elastic waves. The two models are based on the same effective medium approach and involve the same microstructural parameters. A workflow based on this explicit modelling approach is devised that allows for the prediction of the TC of a reservoir rock using (i) the elastic waves velocities, (ii) the dominant mineral content and (iii) the bulk porosity. This workflow is validated using experimental data reported in the literature for dry and water-saturated Fontainebleau and Berea sandstones. The datasets include measurements of TC and EWV as a function of effective pressure. In addition, it is shown that the dependence of TC on the rock microstructure is formally and practically similar to that of EWV. It is also demonstrated that the accuracy of TC predictions from EWV increases with effective pressure (burial depth). The underlying assumptions and limitations of the present approach together with the effect of burial are discussed.},

Currently, the heavy oil reservoir production challenges are addressed by thermal recovery techniques, CHOPS, chemical injection and miscible gas injection. In this work, the advantages of three different processes viz thermal, chemical and miscible gas injection have been merged together to come up with a novel viscosity reducing process for heavy oil. Metal Nanoparticles are used for thermal conductivity enhancement of super critical-CO2 (sc-CO2) or {\"{i}}¿½{\AA}“Viscosity reducing Injectant 0xE2 0x80 ? (VRI) for reducing the viscosity of heavy oil rapidly as compared to conventional sc-CO2 or VRI. A sc-CO2soluble surfactant has also been added to the mixture to further enhance the viscosity reduction. Thus the thermal properties of metal nanoparticles, the chemical properties of surfactant and the miscible properties of sc-CO2 and VRI altogether reduce the viscosity of heavy oil. INTRODUCTION Crude oil is considered {\"{i}}¿½{\AA}“heavy 0xE2 0x80 ? if its API gravity is lower than 20 degrees. Heavy oil is asphaltic, dense, and viscous oil that is chemically characterized by its content of asphaltenes. In spite of an immense resource base, heavy oil and natural bitumen accounted for only about 3 billion barrels of the 25 billion barrels of crude oil produced in 2000 (U.S.G.S Fact Sheet 70-03, August 2003). Currently, producers target heavy oil accumulations having better quality oil in terms of chemistry and density. About 66 percent of the heavy oil produced annually is lighter than 15{\^{A}}° API gravity, but about 50 percent of the estimated technically recoverable heavy oil is denser (less than 15{\^{A}}° API gravity, see Figure 1). In conventional production, reservoir pressure from gas and water associated with the oil is generally sufficient to cause light oil to flow to a production well. However, to sustain commercial well production rates, heavy and extra-heavy oil production almost always requires measures to reduce oil viscosity and to introduce energy into the reservoir. When super-heated steam is injected into a reservoir, oil viscosity is reduced and reservoir pressure is increased through displacement and partial distillation of the oil. Steam may be injected continuously to form a flood or it may be injected in cycles so wells are used alternately for injection and production. EOR, using miscible gas displacement, is a widely used technique and can increase the production of oil beyond what is typically achievable using the conventional recovery methods. Gas injectants are generally injected into the reservoirs either in immiscible or miscible condition. Miscible gas injection, where the gas becomes miscible with the reservoir fluid at reservoir temperature, is amongst the most widely used EOR process in the US today after thermal recovery processes, and it accounts for significant EOR oil production.

abstract = {Electron beam irradiation of amorphous GeSe4 thin films reveals formation of reliefs and trenches as a function of electron beam dose. Mounds as high as 115 nm are observed at low electron beam dose and trenches as deep as 180 nm at high dose. The geometry of trench and mound formation is examined as a function of electron beam dose, film thickness, conductive overlayer thickness, exposure count, and beam step size. Thicker films are found to more likely form trenches than thinner ones. Physical mechanisms for trench and mound formation are proposed. Both types of deformations provide a route toward the direct write of optical waveguides, gratings, and waveguide-cavity coupled structures onto thin films of chalcogenide glass.

abstract = {A study concerning the effect of growth condition on As incorporation and formation of defects using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is presented. It is well known that devices in a narrow bandgap HgCdTe material system could suffer from tunneling currents and generation recombination processes, espe- cially at cryogenic temperatures, due to material defects. For in-situ As doped p- on-n device structures grown by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE), extended defects and in particular twinning in a p-type layer grown under Hg-rich conditions is believed to reduce the zero bias dynamic impedance of devices and significantly impact recombination of carriers in the space charge region. Using TEM we have studied defects formed in As-doped layers grown under Hg- and Te-rich conditions. Samples grown under high II/VI flux ratio at growth tem- perature of 170∞C have a high density of columnar twin defects, whereas no twin defects were seen for layers grown under optimal growth conditions at 190∞C. A very high flux of As, however, was required to incorporate As into the layers at growth temperature of 190∞C},

abstract = {Representative surface reconstruction algorithms taking a gradient field as input enforce the integrability constraint in a discrete manner. While enforcing integrability allows the subsequent integration to produce surface heights, existing algorithms have one or more of the following disadvantages: They can only handle dense per-pixel gradient fields, smooth out sharp features in a partially integrable field, or produce severe surface distortion in the results. In this paper, we present a method which does not enforce discrete integrability and reconstructs a 3D continuous surface from a gradient or a height field, or a combination of both, which can be dense or sparse. The key to our approach is the use of kernel basis functions, which transfer the continuous surface reconstruction problem into high-dimensional space, where a closed-form solution exists. By using the Gaussian kernel, we can derive a straightforward implementation which is able to produce results better than traditional techniques. In general, an important advantage of our kernel-based method is that the method does not suffer discretization and finite approximation, both of which lead to surface distortion, which is typical of Fourier or wavelet bases widely adopted by previous representative approaches. We perform comparisons with classical and recent methods on benchmark as well as challenging data sets to demonstrate that our method produces accurate surface reconstruction that preserves salient and sharp features.

This restoration was previously discussed [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 3866 (2000)] in regard to whether it may yield superresolved images. The divergence of the wave field in the slab, and its equivalence with that of the inverse diffraction propagator in free space, is addressed. Further, the existence of absorption, its regularization of this divergence, and the trade-off of a resulting limited superresolution are analyzed in detail in terms of its effect on the evanescent components of the wave field and hence on the transfer function width.},

abstract = {A multi-layer, two-dimensional mathematical model of reservoir heating by Radio-Frequency (RF) Electromagnetic (EM) radiation for heavy oil recovery is presented. The model takes into account the heat loss in the wellbore and into the surrounding formations. The validity of the mathematical model is tested on a real field case application. A sensitivity analysis on the damping coefficient of EM waves is also performed. It is shown that the occurrence of volumetric heat sources at the bottom hole caused by EM field action yields an intensive deep heating of the reservoir with a small temperature gradient. Numerical calculations show that the bottom-hole pressure and the EM generator power are essential factors in determining the heat transfer processes and heavy oil production. The method of RF-EM radiation is also compared to “cold” production (without any influence of heating).},

A theory has been developed which, subject to certain restrictions, describes the modes of this type of beam waveguide and predicts a loss of the order of 0.01 db per iteration. A reflecting beam waveguide comprising eight aluminum reflectors has been investigated at a wavelength of 4 millimeters. The measured loss per iteration is approximately 0.015 db which is in good agreement with the theoretical value. The cross-sectional electric field distribution has also been measured and found to be in satisfactory agreement with the theory. It is shown that the reflecting beam waveguide is a practical system for the transmission of power at submillimeter wavelengths.},

The contribution of the enthalpy of oxidation used in the model was determined experimentally by capturing the ejected melt and measuring the volume percentage of oxidation. The formulation of recoil pressure used in the model takes into account hole diameter and depth, and the associated pressure variation. The model presented also considers pulse width which is shown to affect the drilling velocity. The model enables the prediction of the velocity of melt ejection, and the drilling rate, as well as the contributions of melt ejection and vapourisation to the overall drilling rate. The calculated drilling rates are in close agreement with the experimental results. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Hoffman2007,
abstract = {An optical metamaterial is a composite in which subwavelength features, rather than the constituent materials, control the macroscopic electromagnetic properties of the material. Recently, properly designed metamaterials have garnered much interest because of their unusual interaction with electromagnetic waves. Whereas nature seems to have limits on the type of materials that exist, newly invented metamaterials are not bound by such constraints. These newly accessible electromagnetic properties make these materials an excellent platform for demonstrating unusual optical phenomena and unique applications such as subwavelength imaging and planar lens design. 'Negative-index materials', as first proposed, required the permittivity, epsilon, and permeability, mu, to be simultaneously less than zero, but such materials face limitations. Here, we demonstrate a comparatively low-loss, three-dimensional, all-semiconductor metamaterial that exhibits negative refraction for all incidence angles in the long-wave infrared region and requires only an anisotropic dielectric function with a single resonance. Using reflection and transmission measurements and a comprehensive model of the material, we demonstrate that our material exhibits negative refraction. This is furthermore confirmed through a straightforward beam optics experiment. This work will influence future metamaterial designs and their incorporation into optical semiconductor devices.},

@article{Liu2014,
abstract = {Most of the current thermal power-generation technologies must first convert thermal energy to mechanical work before producing electricity. Thermoelectric generation technology, as one entirely solid-state energy conversion method, can directly transform thermal energy into electricity by using thermoelectric transformation materials. A thermoelectric power converter has no moving parts, and is compact, quiet, highly reliable and environmentally friendly. Therefore, the whole system can be simplified and operated over an extended period of time with minimal maintenance. In addition, it has a wider choice of thermal sources. It can utilize both the high- and low-quality heat to generate electricity. The low-quality heat may not be utilized effectively by conventional methods such as ORC technology. In this study, a direct heat to electricity (DHE) technology using the thermoelectric effect, without the need to change through mechanical energy, was applied to harvest low-enthalpy thermal work. Such a power generation system has been designed and built using thermoelectric generator (TEG) modules manufactured using a new technique. The targets of this technique were low cost and high thermal to electricity efficiency. Experiments have been conducted to measure the output power at different conditions: different inlet temperature and temperature differences between hot and cold sides. TEG modules manufactured with different materials have also been tested. The power generator assembled with TEG modules had an installed power of 1 KW at a temperature difference of around 120 °C. The power generated by the thermoelectric system is almost directly proportional to the temperature difference between the hot and the cold sides. The cost of the DHE power generator is much lower than that of photovoltaics (PV) in terms of equivalent energy generated. The TEG systems are ready to be applied practically in many geothermal sites with low temperature resources, including oil fields where fossil and geothermal energies are co-produced.},

The samples used for this experiment were NIST glass standards, dielectrics that exhibit different ablation properties compared to metal targets. Our results demonstrate that in the range of 40 fs to 1 ps, negligible differences occur in signal intensity, elemental ratios, and detection limits. The U/Pb and U/Th ratios, which were examined to ensure limited fractionation, give comparable results at all pulse widths investigated.},

abstract = {Silver halide sensitized gelatin (SHSG) holograms are similar to holograms recorded in dichromated gelatin (DCG), the main recording material for holographic optical elements (HOE's). The drawback of DCG is its low sensitivity and limited spectral response. Silver halide materials can be processed in such a way that the final hologram will have properties like a DCG hologram. Recently this technique has become more interesting since the introduction of new ultra-high-resolution silver halide emulsions. An optimized processing technique for transmission HOE's recorded in these materials is introduced. Diffraction efficiencies over 90{\%} can be obtained for transmissive diffraction gratings. Understanding the importance of the selective hardening process has made it possible to obtain results similar to conventional DCG processing. The main advantage of the SHSG process is that high-sensitivity recording can be performed with laser wavelengths anywhere within the visible spectrum. This simplifies the manufacturing of high-quality, large-format HOE's.},

abstract = {Thermal conductivity (TC) is among the most important characteristics of porous media for hydrocarbon reservoir thermal simulation and evaluating the efficiency of the thermal enhanced oil recovery process. In this study a two-layer artificial neural network (ANN) approach is proposed for estimating the effective TCs of dry and oil saturated sandstone at a wide range of environmental conditions. Temperature, pressure, porosity, bulk density of rock, fluid density and oil saturation are employed as independent variables for prediction of effective TCs of sandstone. Various types of ANN such as multi-layer perceptron (MLP), radial basis function, generalized regression and cascade-forward neural network have been examined and their predictive capabilities are compared. Statistical errors analysis confirms that a two-layer MLP network with seven and 15 hidden neurons are optimal topologies for modeling of TC of oil saturated and dry sandstone, respectively. The predictive capabilities of the optimal MLP models are validated by conventional recommended correlation and a large number of experimental data which were collected from various literatures. The predicted effective TC values have a good agreement with the experimental TC data, i.e., an absolute average relative deviation percent of 2.73{\%} and 3.81{\%} for the overall experimental dataset of oil saturated and dry sandstone, respectively. The results justify the superiority of the optimal MLP networks over the other considered models in simulation of the experimental effective TCs of dry and oil saturated sandstones.},

Currently, there is great interest in miniaturizing heat engines, but so far traditional heat engines operating with the expansion and compression of gas have not reached length scales shorter than one millimeter. Here, a micrometer-sized piston steam engine is implemented in an optical tweezer. The piston is a single colloidal microparticle that is driven by explosive vapourization of the surrounding liquid (cavitation bubbles) and by optical forces at a rate between a few tens of Hertz and one kilo-Hertz. The operation of the engine allows to exert impulsive forces with optical tweezers and induce streaming in the liquid, similar to the effect of transducers when driven at acoustic and ultrasound frequencies.},

abstract = {We have shown that high-repetition rate short-pulse laser deposition can be used to successfully fabricate low loss waveguide {\textregistered}lms in As2S3 chalcogenide glasses. The resulting {\textregistered}lms are highly photosensitive and can be used without thermal annealing in waveguide fabrication. Waveguide losses as low as 0.2 dB/cm in laser written waveguides have been measured at 1550 nm. The results suggest that ultra-fast pulsed laser deposition may be an important process for the production of low loss waveguides in the chalcogenides. {\#} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V},

@article{Dudda2013,
abstract = {In this study we investigate nanoparticle dispersions in a molten binary nitrate salt eutectic. It has been recently reported that nanoparticle dispersions in molten salt mixtures can significantly enhance the specific heat capacity of the salt mixtures. These molten salt mixtures can be used as heat transfer fluid (HTF)/thermal energy storage (TES) in a concentrated solar power (CSP) plant and enhancing their specific heat capacity can significantly reduce the cost of electricity produced by CSP. However, the mechanism for the enhanced specific heat capacity is still under investigation and has not been clearly explained. In this paper, we investigate the effect of nanoparticle size on the specific heat capacity of nanoparticle/molten salt eutectic mixture. Four different sizes of nanoparticles (5 nm, 10 nm, 30 nm, and 60 nm) were dispersed in a molten nitrate salt eutectic at 1{\%} concentration by weight. The molten nitrate salt eutectic consisted of sodium nitrate (NaNO3) and potassium nitrate (KNO3) at compositions of 60{\%} and 40{\%} by weight. A modulated differential scanning calorimeter (MDSC) was employed to measure the specific heat capacity of the pure molten salt eutectic and the nanomaterials (pure molten salt eutectic mixed with nanoparticles). The specific heat capacity of the nanomaterials was enhanced with increase of nanoparticle size. The observed enhancement was found to be 8{\%} for 5 nm, 12{\%} for 10 nm, 19{\%} for 30 nm and 27{\%} for the 60 nm. Material characterization analyses were carried out to investigate microstructural change of the nanomaterials. It was observed that special nanostructures were formed by molten salt mixtures in the nanomaterial samples and the amount of observed nanostructures was increased with the measured specific heat capacity. This indicates that nanostructures formed in the nanomaterials may be responsible for the enhanced specific heat capacity of the nanomaterials.},

The pressure effects on the viscosities of n-hexane and n-octane were also determined at 0 and 60°. The densities of diethyl ether and cyclopentanone and the dielectric constant of carbon tetrachloride at high pressures are also recorded.

abstract = {Based on the interference fringes in transmission spectra at normal incidence of thin films of As2S3 and As2Se3 semiconducting glass compositions deposited by thermal evaporation, a method is applied that makes it possible to obtain a parameter indicating the degree of film thickness uniformity, and to accurately determine the refractive index subsequently used to derive the average film thickness. Thickness measurements have been performed with a surface profiling stylus to check the results from the transmission spectra, showing a very good agreement between both measurements. The dispersion of n is discussed in terms of the single-oscillator Wemple and DiDomenico model. The optical absorption edges are described using the non-direct transition model proposed by Tauc. The optical energy gaps were calculated using Tauc's extrapolation, resulting in values of 2.37 and 1.80 eV respectively. Finally, the optical band gap is interpreted in terms of the bond-strengths of the chemical bonds present in the glass compositions under study.},

abstract = {A Stefan problem is a free boundary problem where a phase boundary moves as a function of time. In this article, we consider one-dimensional and two-dimensional enthalpy-formulated Stefan problems. The enthalpy formulation has the advantage that the governing equations stay the same, regardless of the material state (liquid or solid). Numerical solutions are obtained by implementing the Godunov method. Our simu- lation of the temperature distribution and interface position for the one-dimensional Stefan problem is validated against the exact solution, and the method is then applied to the two-dimensional Stefan problem with reference to cryosurgery, where extremely cold temperatures are applied to destroy cancer cells. The temperature distribution and interface position obtained provide important information to control the cryosurgery procedure.},

abstract = {This review discusses how low-energy valence excitations created by swift electrons can render information on the optical response of structured materials with unmatched spatial resolution. Electron microscopes are capable of focusing electron beams on subnanometer spots and probing the target response either by analyzing electron energy losses or by detecting emitted radiation. Theoretical frameworks suited to calculate the probability of energy loss and light emission cathodoluminescence are reconsidered and compared with experimental results. More precisely, a quantum-mechanical description of the interaction between the electrons and the sample is discussed, followed by a powerful classical dielectric approach that can be applied in practice to more complex systems. The conditions are assessed under which classical and quantum-mechanical formulations are equivalent. The excitation of collective modes such as plasmons is studied in bulk materials, planar surfaces, and nanoparticles. Light emission induced by the electrons is shown to constitute an excellent probe of plasmons, combining subnanometer resolution in the position of the electron beam with nanometer resolution in the emitted wavelength. Both electron energy-loss and cathodoluminescence spectroscopies performed in a scanning mode of operation yield snapshots of plasmon modes in nanostructures with ﬁne spatial detail as compared to other existing imaging techniques, thus providing an ideal tool for nanophotonics studies.},

abstract = {In most laser applications it is necessary to focus, modify, or shape the laser beam by using lenses and other optical elements. In general, laser-beam propagation can be approximated by assuming that the laser beam has an ideal Gaussian intensity profile, which corresponds to the theoretical TEM00 mode. Coherent Gaussian beams have peculiar transformation properties which require special consideration. In order to select the best optics for a particular laser application, it is important to understand the basic properties of Gaussian beams. Unfortunately, the output from real-life lasers is not truly Gaussian (although the output of a single mode fiber is a very close approximation). To accom- modate this variance, a quality factor, M2 (called the M-squared factor), has been defined to describe the deviation of the laser beam from a theoretical Gaussian. For a theoretical Gaussian, M2 = 1; for a real laser beam, M2{\textgreater}1. The M2 factor for helium neon lasers is typically less than 1.1; for ion lasers, the M2 factor typically is between 1.1 and 1.3. Collimated TEM00 diode laser beams usually have an M2 ranging from 1.1 to 1.7. For high-energy multimode lasers, the M2 factor can be as high as 25 or 30. In all cases, the M2 factor affects the characteristics of a laser beam and cannot be neglected in optical designs. In the following section, Gaussian Beam Propagation, we will treat the characteristics of a theoretical Gaussian beam (M2=1); then, in the section Real Beam Propagation we will show how these characteristics change as the beam deviates from the theoretical. In all cases, a circularly symmetric wavefront is assumed, as would be the case for a helium neon laser or an argon-ion laser. Diode laser beams are asymmetric and often astigmatic, which causes their transformation to be more complex},

abstract = {Abstract Enhanced Oil Recovery techniques are gaining more attention worldwide as the proved oil reserves are declining and the oil price is hiking. Although many giant oil reservoirs in the world were already screened for EOR processes, the main challenges such as low sweep efficiency, costly techniques, possible formation damages, transportation of huge amounts of EOR agents to the fields especially for offshore cases, analyzing micro-scale multi-phase flow in the rock to the large scale tests and the lack of analyzing tools in traditional experimental works, hinder the proposed EOR processes. Our past experiences on using nanotechnology to the upstream cases, especially EOR processes, revealed solutions to some of the challenges associated with old EOR techniques. This method that utilizes particles in the order of 1 to100nm brings specific thermal, optical, electrical, rheological and interfacial properties which are directly useful to release the trapped oil from the pore spaces in the order of 5 to 50 microns of tight oil formations. Laboratory tests using nanoparticles as the EOR agent, developing nano computational models to explore the surface properties and utilizing nano-scale analyzing tools such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) mostly for nanoparticles distribution in the pore spaces and on the surfaces for wettability alteration studies are the main parts of this investigation},

abstract = {In this work we develop a high-resolution mapped-grid finite volume method code to model wave propagation in two dimensions in systems of multiple orthotropic poroelastic media and/or fluids, with curved interfaces between different media. We use a unified formulation to simplify modeling of the various interface conditions -- open pores, imperfect hydraulic contact, or sealed pores -- that may exist between such media. Our numerical code is based on the Clawpack framework, but in order to obtain correct results at a material interface we use a modified transverse Riemann solution scheme, and at such interfaces are forced to drop the second-order correction term typical of high-resolution finite volume methods. We verify our code against analytical solutions for reflection and transmission of waves at a material interface, and for scattering of an acoustic wave train around an isotropic poroelastic cylinder. For reflection and transmission at a flat interface, we achieve second-order convergence in the 1-norm, and first-order in the max-norm; for the cylindrical scatterer, the highly distorted grid mapping degrades performance but we still achieve convergence at a reduced rate. We also simulate an acoustic pulse striking a simplified model of a human femur bone, as an example of the capabilities of the code.

abstract = {Heavy-oil or bitumen recovery requires effective recovery of many different components of hydrocarbons for an efficient process. Production of asphaltenic components and minimizing their precipitation, which may affect the ultimate recovery and rate, is of particular interest. Conventional thermal and solvent techniques are limited in breaking asphaltene components and new types of catalysts are needed for efficient recovery of heavy-oil. The presence of nano-size metal particles catalyzes the breaking of carbon-sulfur bonds within asphaltenes. This results in a reduction of asphaltene content, with an increase in saturates and aromatic content. The end effect of this process is a significant reduction in the viscosity of heavy oil and bitumen. Having a strong hydrogen donor present dramatically increases the amount of viscosity reduction, while not having any hydrogen donor present completely inhibits the reaction. The proper metals and corresponding concentrations need to be investigated before conducting displacement experiments in porous media. In this paper, we investigated the effects of microwave radiation, using a standard 2.45 GHz emitter, on viscosity reduction. Different nano-sized metal particles (Fe, Fe(III) Oxide, and Cu) were used as catalysts in concentrations ranging 0.1{\%} weight to 1{\%} weight. Heavy oil samples were heated to and maintained at a temperature of 200°C using inductive microwave heating for a period of 5 hours. Viscosity and mass data were obtained before and after each experiment, with viscosity being measured at 55 °C, 75°C, and 95°C. Since the heavy oil samples which contained no added hydrogen donors experienced a significant vaporization of components, they must be participating in a reaction independent of the aquathermolysis reaction.},

@article{Taioli2010,
abstract = {The recent, very significant developments in high intensity and brightness electron and photon sources have opened new possibilities of applying electron spectroscopies, such as photoemission, Auger and electron energy loss, to the study of many interesting features in the dynamics of atoms, molecules and condensed-matter systems. In the last few years it has become possible to obtain electron spectra with an overall energy resolution (electron/photon source and electron spectrometer) considerably smaller than the linewidth of the investigated level and to study quantitatively the combined effects of the intrinsic dynamical properties of the system, of features of the incident beam and of the electron spectrometer on the spectral lineshape. For all these reasons, it is important to have theoretical methods that are able to analyze the dynamics of systems at any level of aggregation under the influence of an incident radiation and, simultaneously, to predict spectral lineshapes quantitatively by correlating their features with internal dynamics of the perturbed system. In this report, we present experiments and a critical overview of theoretical methods for interpreting electron spectra of atoms, molecules and solid-state systems. The general theoretical framework for this analysis is resonant multichannel scattering theory. Electron spectroscopies are, in fact, based on scattering processes in which the initial state consists of a projectile, typically photons or electrons, exciting a target to a resonant state, which has long lifetimes if compared to the collision time. This metastable state is embedded in the continuum of final states characterized by the presence of a few fragments, whose observation provides useful information on the properties of the system under study. Even if the general theory of scattering and decay phenomena has been largely developed, its specific application to electron spectroscopies in condensed matter and, in several cases also to atoms and molecules, presents difficulties that have hindered the production of high quality theoretical spectra until recently. This is mainly due to computational problems related to treating a large number of decay channels, which prevent one from using numerical techniques for representing the electron as it moves outward through the field of the ionized system. Furthermore, another issue is represented by the need to account for shake processes and extrinsic energy losses due to the coupling with collective excitations. In this work we present a theoretical method which does not suffer from the limitations of previous approaches, and allows one accurately to reproduce the experimental results in solids. This method provides an extension to condensed matter of Fano's formulation of the interaction between discrete and continuum states. It includes the combined effects of intrinsic and extrinsic features on spectral lineshapes so that computed spectra are directly comparable to acquired spectra, avoiding background subtraction or deconvolution procedures. This approach is sufficiently general to be applied not only to the analysis and interpretation of autoionization, Auger and photoemission spectra, but also to the study of other processes since its central feature is the ability of calculating accurate wavefunctions for continuum states of extended systems.},

abstract = {In order for heavy oil and bitumen recovery to be efficient, all components present within the oil must be produced. To achieve a highly efficient production process it is essential that we are able to produce asphaltenic components and limit their precipitation. Solvent and conventional thermal techniques are largely limited in their ability to crack asphaltenic components; thus, new techniques and catalysts are needed to more efficiently recover heavy oil.When nano-size metal particles are present they catalyze the breaking of carbon-sulfur bonds within asphaltenic components. The result of this process is an increase in saturates and aromatics, while simultaneously reducing the asphaltene content. This process dramatically lowers the viscosity of heavy oil and bitumen by significantly reducing the average molecular weight. This effect can be dramatically increased by having a strong hydrogen donor present and can be completely inhibited by the removal of all hydrogen donors. When conducting these types of reactions in-situ, it is very difficult and expensive to introduce strong hydrogen donors. Therefore, it is imperative that hydrogen donors be created within the oil rather than be introduced from an external source.In this paper, we investigated the effects of microwave radiation, using a 2.45. GHz emitter, on the recovery of heavy oil from a sand pack. Experiments were conducted with and without nano-size nickel catalyst being present. Heavy oil samples were heated at differing power levels until recovery of heavy oil leveled out. In all cases, the nano-nickel catalysts performed better than their microwave-only counterparts due to the increased cracking and vaporization demonstrated by Greff and Babadagli (2011) to take place in the presence of nano-size metal catalysts and microwaves. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We consider the one-dimensional propagation of electromagnetic waves in a weakly nonlinear and low-contrast spatially inhomogeneous medium with no energy dissipation. We focus on the case of a periodic medium, in which dispersion enters only through the (Floquet-Bloch) spectral band dispersion associated with the periodic structure; chromatic dispersion (time-nonlocality of the polarization) is neglected. Numerical simulations show that for initial conditions of wave-packet type (a plane wave of fixed carrier frequency multiplied by a slow varying, spatially localized function) very long-lived spatially localized coherent soliton-like structures emerge, whose character is that of a slowly varying envelope of a train of shocks. We call this structure an envelope carrier-shock train. The structure of the solution violates the oft-assumed nearly monochromatic wave packet structure, whose envelope is governed by the nonlinear coupled mode equations (NLCME). The inconsistency and inaccuracy of NLCME lies in the neglect of all (infinitely many) resonances except for the principle resonance induced by the initial carrier frequency. We derive, via a nonlinear geometrical optics expansion, a system of nonlocal integro-differential equations governing the coupled evolution of backward and forward propagating waves. These equations incorporate effects of all resonances. In a periodic medium, these equations may be expressed as a system of infinitely many coupled mode equations, which we call the extended nonlinear coupled mode system (xNLCME). Truncating xNLCME to include only the principle resonances leads to the classical NLCME. Numerical simulations of xNLCME demonstrate that it captures both large scale features, related to third harmonic generation, and fine scale carrier shocks features of the nonlinear periodic Maxwell equations.},

Optical emission spectroscopy is used to infer temperature and density of the sparks. Significant energy absorption by the plasma is observed just above the breakdown threshold. The energy absorption and propagation in the spark indicated that argon plasma is more absorptive than air plasma. The absorption of the spark increases with laser energy, and at higher energies absorption saturation is observed. A spiky behavior is observed in the transmitted temporal profiles of lasers at higher energies and this is explained as due to the formation of a self-regulating regime.},

abstract = {Effective thermal conductivity (ETC) of dry sandstone was measured over a temperature range from 275 to 523K and at pressures up to 400MPa with a guarded parallel-plate apparatus. The estimated uncertainty of the ETC measurements is 2{\%}. The porosity of the sample was 13{\%}. A rapid increase of ETC was found for dry sandstone at low pressures between 0.1 and 100MPa along various isotherms. At high-pressure range (P{\textgreater}100MPa) a weak linear dependence of the ETC with pressure was observed. The pressure effect is negligibly small after first 80–100MPa where bridging of microcracks or improvement of grain contacts takes place. We interpreted the measured ETC data using a various theoretical and semi-empirical models in order to check their accuracy and predictive capability. The effect of structure (size, shape, and distribution of the pores), porosity, and mineralogical composition on temperature and pressure dependences of the ETC of sandstone was discussed. To estimate the effect of temperature and pressure on the ETC of sandstone the pressure, $\beta$P, and temperature, $\beta$T, coefficients of ETC were calculated from the measured values of ETC. The measured values of the ETC were also used to calculate the values of the isothermal compressibility, $\chi$T, and thermal expansion coefficient, $\alpha$. The equation of state of sandstone was developed using the measured ETC data.},

Energy transfer from the Er3+ lower laser level to a Pr3+ codopant decreases ground-state bleaching and excited-state absorption, thus avoiding output-power saturation. This result represents more than an order-of-magnitude improvement over previous work of which we are aware. Advantages over current crystal-laser designs include nearly transverse-fundamental-mode operation, reduced thermal effects, and ease of use, e.g., in medical endoscopy.},

Ultrashort pulses are important as they can be used to probe the properties of matter on extremely short time scales. Within the context of nonlinear optics, ultrashort laser pulses are of great interest. This chapter treats aspects of the propagation of ultrashort laser pulses through optical systems. Some physical processes included in the analysis are self-steepening leading to optical shockwave formation, the influence of higher order dispersion, and space–time coupling effects. A form of the pulse propagation equation relevant to the propagation of an ultrashort laser pulse through a nonlinear, dispersive nonlinear optical medium was also derived. The chapter discusses the conceptual framework that can be used to describe intense-field nonlinear optics. A brief historical summary of progress in the field of intense-field nonlinear optics and high-harmonic generation is presented in this chapter. Equations related to the motion of a free electron in a laser field are also discussed in the chapter.},

abstract = {Thermal conductivity of both dry and fully water (brine solution, 5g/l NaCl concentration) saturated rocks have been measured for 35 sandstone core samples obtained from both Hungary and Egypt. Measurements are executed in order to look for thermal anisotropy. The rock porosity, permeability and density were measured beside thermal conductivity, while some correlations were performed in order to differentiate among clayey laminated, flaser bedding and clean sandstone reservoirs. There is a very close correlation among thermal conductivity, rock porosity, bulk density, gas permeability and ultrasonic wave velocities for non laminated clean sandstones, while in banded sandstone reservoirs these relations show more than one trend giving a strong impression indicating the presence of more than one grain–fabric system and/or complex diagenesis. The relationship among the measured thermal conductivity for the core axis, the top and bottom are close and homogeneous for isotropic clean non laminated Szolnok sandstones, while they are vary in a wide range for banded and laminated Bahariya sandstone samples. The measured specific heat capacity indicates that some banded sandstone samples of the Bahariya Formation have bound water appears at 100°C and giving low specific heat capacity value. This bound water can acted on all petrophysical parameters especially electrical properties. The prediction of specific heat capacity and heat flow from the reservoir temperature is possible using the calculated multi-regression and linear regression models.},

However, lesion ablation by RA in angulated segments may be affected by guidewire bias, leading to a non-uniform plaque modification. Intravascular optical coherence tomography (iOCT) is the highest resolution (10 $\mu$m axial) intravascular imaging modality available for clinical use; furthermore, near infrared light easily penetrates calcium, with significantly fewer artifacts, including no "blooming effect" as seen by intravascular ultrasound. Therefore, it may pose as a unique tool for serial calcium quantification, as related in this article with pre- and post-RA assessment, allowing accurate characterization of plaque modification, as well as quality of stent deployment. The effects of guidewire bias in the debulking process have not been well documented by iOCT. We present a case of lesion preparation by RA affected by guidewire bias in which iOCT revealed unique insights into CCP modification. 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The earlier chapters describe the quantum mechanics of various optical processes, leading from the classical representation of the electromagnetic field to the quantum theory of light. The later chapters develop the theoretical descriptions of some of the key experiments in quantum optics. Over half of the material in this Third Edition is new. It includes topics that have come into prominence over the last two decades, such as the beamsplitter theory, squeezed light, two-photon interference, balanced homodyne detection, travelling-wave attenuation and amplification, quantum jumps, and the ranges of nonlinear optical processes important in the generation of nonclassical light. The book is written as a textbook, with the treatment as a whole appropriate for graduate or postgraduate students, while earlier chapters are also suitable for final-year undergraduates.

The method is based on illuminating the sample with a plane light beam and measuring the infrared emission with an infrared detector. The amplitude and phase of the PTR voltage is recorded as a function of the modulation frequency and then fitted to the theoretical model. In this work, we test the ability of modulated PTR to retrieve simultaneously the thermal diffusivity and the optical absorption coefficient of homogeneous slabs. In order to eliminate the instrumental factor, self-normalization is used, i.e., the ratio of the PTR signal recorded at the rear and front surfaces. The influence of the multiple reflections of the light beam, the heat losses, and the transparency to infrared wavelengths are analyzed. Measurements performed on a wide variety of homogeneous materials, covering the whole range from transparent to opaque, confirm the validity of the method. In Part II of this work, the method is extended to multilayered materials.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses the basics of nonlinear optical interactions and presents derivation of the most general form of the wave equation in nonlinear optics. Nonlinearity in the response of a material system to an intense laser field can cause the polarization of the medium to develop new frequency components not present in the incident radiation field. These new frequency components of the polarization act as sources of new frequency components of the electromagnetic field. This chapter examines how Maxwell's equations describe the generation of these new components of the field, and explores how the various frequency components of the field become coupled by the nonlinear interaction. This chapter develops the mathematical theory of these effects and presents a simple physical picture of how these frequency components are generated. The chapter also discusses how nonlinear optical wave equation can be used to describe specific nonlinear optical interactions. One of the sections treats the process of sum-frequency generation in the simple limit in which the two input fields are undepleted by the nonlinear interaction. The chapter describes techniques that utilize the birefringence of an optical material to achieve the phase-matching condition of nonlinear optics.},

abstract = {We present a comprehensive analysis of the technique of Longitudinal-Mode-Filling (LMF) to reduce Stimulated Brillouin Scattering (SBS) limitations in Ytterbium Doped Fibre Amplifiers (YDFA), for the generation of nanosecond, temporally shaped pulses. A basic Master-Oscillator-Power-Amplifier (MOPA) system, comprising an output YDFA with 10 µm-core active fibre, is experienced for benchmarking purposes. Input pulse-shaping is operated thanks to direct current modulation in highly multimode laser-diode seeds, either based on the use of Distributed Feed-Back (DFB) or of a Fibre Bragg Grating (FBG). These seeds enable wavelength control. We verify the effectiveness of the combination of LMF, with appropriate mode spacing, in combination with natural chirp effects from the seed to control the SBS threshold in a broad range of output energies, from a few to some tens of µJ. These variations are discussed versus all the parameters of the laser system. In accordance with the proposal of a couple of basic principles and with the addition of gain saturation effects along the active fibre, we develop a full-vectorial numerical model. Fine fits between experimental results and theoretical expectations are demonstrated. The only limitation of the technique arises from broadband beating noise, which is analysed thanks to a simplified, but fully representative description to discuss the signal-to-noise ratio of the amplified pulses. This provides efficient tools for application to the design of robust and cost-effective MOPAs, aiming to the generation of finely shaped and energetic nanosecond pulses without the need for any additional electro-optics.},

abstract = {Brillouin scattering in optical fibres is a fundamental interaction between light and sound with important implications ranging from optical sensors to slow and fast light. In usual optical fibres, light both excites and feels shear and longitudinal bulk elastic waves, giving rise to forward-guided acoustic wave Brillouin scattering and backward-stimulated Brillouin scattering. In a subwavelength-diameter optical fibre, the situation changes dramatically, as we here report with the first experimental observation of Brillouin light scattering from surface acoustic waves. These Rayleigh-type surface waves travel the wire surface at a specific velocity of 3,400 m s(-1) and backscatter the light with a Doppler shift of about 6 GHz. As these acoustic resonances are sensitive to surface defects or features, surface acoustic wave Brillouin scattering opens new opportunities for various sensing applications, but also in other domains such as microwave photonics and nonlinear plasmonics.},

For reasonable pump power levels, we show that such photonic-chip-based photon-pair sources can exhibit high brightness (≈1 × 109 pairs/s) and high correlation (≈100) if the waveguide length is chosen properly or the waveguide dispersion is engineered. Such a high correlation is possible in the presence of Raman scattering because the Raman profile exhibits a low gain window at a Stokes shift of 7.4 THz, though it is constrained due to multi-pair generation. As the proposed scheme is based on photonic chip technologies, it has the potential to become an integrated platform for the implementation of on-chip quantum technologies.},

The gratings were read with a HeNe laser, and the zero-order and first-order diffraction efficiencies were noted. Rigorous diffraction theory was used to give a homogeneous approximation for the refractive index change. Reactive ion etching was applied to reduce the thickness of the film, and a new value for the refractive index change was evaluated. The refractive index change versus film thickness dependence was found to be linear at low electron doses and Gaussian shaped at higher doses. Through a simple mathematical analysis, the absolute value of the refractive index was determined as a function of the position inside the film. At higher doses, the refractive index change was found to have a maximum value of 3{\%}, approximately 1.2 $\mu$m from the film surface. {\textcopyright} 1997 American Institute of Physics.

abstract = {Mycotoxins are small (MW approximately 700), toxic chemical products formed as secondary metabolites by a few fungal species that readily colonise crops and contaminate them with toxins in the field or after harvest. Ochratoxins and Aflatoxins are mycotoxins of major significance and hence there has been significant research on broad range of analytical and detection techniques that could be useful and practical. Due to the variety of structures of these toxins, it is impossible to use one standard technique for analysis and/or detection. Practical requirements for high-sensitivity analysis and the need for a specialist laboratory setting create challenges for routine analysis. Several existing analytical techniques, which offer flexible and broad-based methods of analysis and in some cases detection, have been discussed in this manuscript. There are a number of methods used, of which many are lab-based, but to our knowledge there seems to be no single technique that stands out above the rest, although analytical liquid chromatography, commonly linked with mass spectroscopy is likely to be popular. This review manuscript discusses (a) sample pre-treatment methods such as liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), supercritical fluid extraction (SFE), solid phase extraction (SPE), (b) separation methods such as (TLC), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), gas chromatography (GC), and capillary electrophoresis (CE) and (c) others such as ELISA. Further currents trends, advantages and disadvantages and future prospects of these methods have been discussed.},

abstract = {In this paper the constitutive relations for moving media with homogeneous and isotropic electric and magnetic properties are presented as the connections between the generalized magnetization-polarization bivector {\$}{\%}\backslashmathcal{\{}M{\}}{\$} and the electromagnetic field F. Using the decompositions of F and {\$}\backslashmathcal{\{}M{\}}{\$}, it is shown how the polarization vector P(x) and the magnetization vector M(x) depend on E, B and two different velocity vectors, u - the bulk velocity vector of the medium, and v - the velocity vector of the observers who measure E and B fields. These constitutive relations with four-dimensional geometric quantities, which correctly transform under the Lorentz transformations (LT), are compared with Minkowski's constitutive relations with the 3-vectors and several essential differences are pointed out. They are caused by the fact that, contrary to the general opinion, the usual transformations of the 3-vectors {\$}{\%} \backslashmathbf{\{}E{\}}{\$}, {\$}\backslashmathbf{\{}B{\}}{\$}, {\$}\backslashmathbf{\{}P{\}}{\$}, {\$}\backslashmathbf{\{}M{\}}{\$}, etc. are not the LT.

Development of new technologies to detect live people through smoke and flames in fire scenes is an extremely desirable goal since it can save human lives. The latest technologies, including equipment adopted by fire departments, use infrared bolometers for infrared digital cameras that allow users to see through smoke. However, such detectors are blinded by flame-emitted radiation. Here we show a completely different approach that makes use of lensless digital holography technology in the infrared range for successful imaging through smoke and flames. Notably, we demonstrate that digital holography with a cw laser allows the recording of dynamic human-size targets. In this work, easy detection of live, moving people is achieved through both smoke and flames, thus demonstrating the capability of digital holography at 10.6 $\mu$m.},

abstract = {The rise in output power from rare-earth-doped fiber sources over the past decade, via the use of cladding-pumped fiber architectures, has been dramatic, leading to a range of fiber-based devices with outstanding performance in terms of output power, beam quality, overall efficiency, and flexibility with regard to operating wavelength and radiation format. This success in the high-power arena is largely due to the fiber's geometry, which provides considerable resilience to the effects of heat generation in the core, and facilitates efficient conversion from relatively low-brightness diode pump radiation to high-brightness laser output. In this paper we review the current state of the art in terms of continuous-wave and pulsed performance of ytterbium-doped fiber lasers, the current fiber gain medium of choice, and by far the most developed in terms of high-power performance. We then review the current status and challenges of extending the technology to other rare-earth dopants and associated wavelengths of operation. Throughout we identify the key factors currently limiting fiber laser performance in different operating regimes—in particular thermal management, optical nonlinearity, and damage. Finally, we speculate as to the likely developments in pump laser technology, fiber design and fabrication, architectural approaches, and functionality that lie ahead in the coming decade and the implications they have on fiber laser performance and industrial/scientific adoption.},

After irradiated by ultraviolet (UV) light with a deuterium lamp for 5 h, the thickness of film decreases largely by 55{\%}, and the refractive index of film changes from 1.484 to 1.445 at 550 nm. The film's optical thickness exhibits an exponential change with the increasing irradiation time. Futhermore, the photo-patternning of the organic-inorganic hybrid film without any further process (wet etching and thermal curing) is performed utilizing the volume contraction on UV-light irradiation. This film has potential applications for fabrication of patterned filter array and apodizing filter by direct light writing, and also demonstrates good temperature stability and immunity to visible light exposure.},

The appearance and the behavior of the melting front can be simulated by modifying the specific heat of the PCM to account for the increased amount of energy, in the form of latent heat of fusion, needed to melt the PCM over its melting temperature range.

@article{Srinivas2011,
abstract = {Introduction: Lasers are a good therapeutic tool for congenital and acquired vascular lesions. Technological advances in lasers have reduced the adverse effects and increased the efficacy. Machines: Among the various lasers used for treating vascular lesions, pulsed dye laser (PDL) has the best efficacy and safety data. The other machines that are widely available are Nd:YAG laser and intense pulse light (IPL). Rationale and scope of guideline: Much variation exists in different machines and techniques, and therefore, establishing standard guidelines has limitations. The guidelines recommended here indicate minimum standards of care for lasers on vascular lesions based on current evidence. Physician Qualification: Laser may be administered by a dermatologist, who has received adequate background training in lasers during post-graduation or later at a center that provides education and training in lasers, or in focused workshops, which provide such trainings. He/she should have adequate knowledge of the lesions being treated, machines, parameters, cooling systems, and aftercare. Facility: The procedure may be performed in the physician's minor procedure room with adequate laser safety measures. Indications: PWS, hemangioma, facial telangiectasia, rosacea, spider angioma, pyogenic granuloma, venous lakes, leg veins. Contraindications: Absolute: Active local infection, photo-aggravated skin diseases, and medical conditions. Relative: Unstable vitiligo, psoriasis, keloid and keloidal tendencies, patient on isotretinoin, patient who is not cooperative or has unrealistic expectation. Patient Selection: Patient selection should be done after detailed counseling with respect to the course of lesions, different treatment options, possible results, cost, need for multiple treatments, and possible postoperative complications. Treatment Sessions: The number of treatments per lesion varies from 2 to 12 or more at 6-8 week intervals. All lesions may not clear completely even after multiple sessions in many cases. Hence, a realistic expectation and proper counseling is very important. Laser parameters: Laser parameters vary with area, type of lesion, skin color, depth of the lesion, and machine used. A test spot may be performed to determine individual specifications. Complications: Pain, edema, purpura, bleeding, scarring, postinflammatory hyperpigmentation/hypopigmentation, and atrophy changes.},

abstract = {This chapter discusses elastic properties. The theory of elasticity gives the basis for the description of elastic wave propagation. Pore fluids (gas, oil, and water) have distinct ranges of compressional or bulk modulus (shear modulus of fluids is zero). The differences in the elastic behavior of these two groups are based on various physical conditions at the contacts of the rock particles. For the first group, conditions are controlled by friction effects, whereas for the second group, physio-chemical phenomena are dominant. Similarly, to consolidated sedimentary rocks, there exists a significant correlation between velocity and porosity for unconsolidated sediments. Velocity values in unconsolidated sediments are distinctly lower than in consolidated sediments. The different influences on the elastic properties result in different types of velocity-saturation functions.},

abstract = {This chapter reviews the areas related to photosensitivity and charge transport: poling of glass, fibers, and their applications. The process of electric field poling, which is a key element in breaking the symmetry of glass leading to a second-order nonlinearity, allows glass to morph into yet another magical form: possessing characteristics highly desirable in waveguides and the ability to modulate light by the application of an electric field. This field was driven by the desire to induce a large nonlinearity and to integrate this property in probably the best waveguide system available today—the optical fiber. Several glass systems are explored and their properties presented with a view of finding the right “sauce” and “recipe” for enhancing the modest, though usefully observable, effect. The physics of the problem was complex to unravel and has been an area of fervent activity. Regrettably, the large nonlinearity remains elusive: Either it can be large but short lived or small and longer lived, depending on the glass type. Transport in glass, therefore, comes under the microscope and different models have led to a better but not complete understanding of the process. However, research has led to several spin-offs, including fiber-optic modulators, tunable gratings, electric field sensors, Q-switches, polarimeters, and others.},

abstract = {A direct computer simulation technique is developed to analyze quantitatively the influence of the fluid flow and heat transfer in the transient development of alaser drilled hole in a turbine airfoil material, where the material removal is effected by vaporization and melt ejection. The coupled conduction heat transfer in the solid and the advection-diffusion heat transfer in the liquid metal, the fluid dynamics of melt expulsion and the tracking of solidliquid and liquidvapor interfaces have been mathematically modeled for the 2D axisymmetric case. The donoracceptor cell method using the volume of fluid approach is used to solve the complex problem and a versatile numerical code has been developed. It takes into account all thermophysical properties including latent heat of vaporization, gravity, and surface tension driving forces. The novelty of this model is to treat the melted pool surface as a deformable free surface. The impressed pressure and temperature on the melt surface is provided by an 1D gas dynamics model whose vaporization kinetics are also discussed. The model is used to simulate drilling for a number of spatially and temporally varying laser intensity profiles. It is found that resolidification of melt (recast formation) occurred throughout the pulse interval and had significant effect on the developing hole geometry, while the effect of vaporization material removal on the hole geometry is found to be small. Comparison of the simulated results indicates the material removed per joule of energy absorbed appears to be inversely proportional to the square root of the peak beam intensity and the drilling rate appears to be proportional to the square root of the surface pressure.},

abstract = {Compared to oxide-based glasses, vitreous materials involving chalcogens form a rather new family of glasses which have received attention, mainly because of their transmission in the mid-infrared. Indeed as low phonon compounds, these heavy-anion glasses allow the fabrication of molded optics for infrared cameras as well as infrared fibers operating in a large spectral range. These waveguides, when correctly tapered, allows the development of a new generation of sensitive evanescent-wave optical sensors which have been used for biomedical applications. Here we will focus on the spectral analysis of biomolecules present in human lung cells by measuring their infrared signatures. Because they contain heavy polarizable anions as well as lone-pair electrons, these glasses exhibit very large non-linear properties compared to silica and are candidates for fast optical switching and signal regeneration in telecom. Due to the technological interest in chalcogenide glasses, more information is needed on their structural organization and 77Se NMR spectroscopy appears to be a useful tool for checking the local environment of the Se atoms.},

The method of Laplace transforms is used. It is shown that two frequency down-shifted surface waves propagating along the plasma boundary in the opposite directions are excited on the temporal discontinuity of the medium. The absolute values of their frequencies are equal, the signs are different. The dependence of the frequencies on the angle of incidence and the final plasma density is studied. The surface waves amplitudes are calculated and analyzed as well.},

abstract = {Cavity optomechanics explores the coupling between the optical field and the mechanical oscillation to induce cooling and regenerative oscillation in a mechanical oscillator. So far, optomechanics relies on the detuning between the cavity and an external pump laser, where the laser acts only as a power supply. Here, we report a new scheme with mutual coupling between a mechanical oscillator that supports a mirror of a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) and the optical field, greatly enhancing the light-matter energy transfer. In this work, we used an ultra-light-weight (130 pg) high-contrast-grating (HCG) mirror in a VCSEL, whose reflectivity spectrum is designed to facilitate strong optomechanical coupling, to demonstrate optomechanically-induced regenerative oscillation of the laser optomechanical cavity with {\textgreater} 550 nm self-oscillation amplitude of the micro-mechanical oscillator, two to three orders of magnitude larger than typical. This new scheme not only offers an efficient approach for high-speed wavelength-swept sources, but also has far-reaching significance in the realization of quantum entanglement of macroscopic objects and ultrasensitive measurement of displacements and forces.},

abstract = {In this study, different nanofluids with phase change behavior were developed by mixing a molten salt base fluid (selected as phase change material) with nanoparticles using the direct-synthesis method. The thermal properties of the nanofluids obtained were investigated. These nanofluids can be used in concentrating solar plants with a reduction of storage material if an improvement in the specific heat is achieved. The base salt mixture was a NaNO3-KNO3 (60:40 ratio) binary salt. The nanoparticles used were silica (SiO2), alumina (Al2O3), titania (TiO2), and a mix of silica-alumina (SiO2-Al2O3). Three weight fractions were evaluated: 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 wt.{\%}. Each nanofluid was prepared in water solution, sonicated, and evaporated. Measurements on thermophysical properties were performed by differential scanning calorimetry analysis and the dispersion of the nanoparticles was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The results obtained show that the addition of 1.0 wt.{\%} of nanoparticles to the base salt increases the specific heat of 15{\%} to 57{\%} in the solid phase and of 1{\%} to 22{\%} in the liquid phase. In particular, this research shows that the addition of silica-alumina nanoparticles has a significant potential for enhancing the thermal storage characteristics of the NaNO3-KNO3 binary salt. These results deviated from the predictions of the theoretical model used. SEM suggests a greater interaction between these nanoparticles and the salt.},

abstract = {We propose a novel scheme for suppressing stimulated Brillouin scattering in optical fibers. The scheme makes use of a single or a sampled Bragg grating fabricated within the fiber used for transmitting intense Q-switched pulses. The grating is designed such that the spectrum of the Stokes pulse generated through stimulated Brillouin scattering falls entirely within its stop band. We show numerically that 15-ns pulses with 2-kW peak power can be transmitted though a 1-m-long fiber with little energy loss using this scheme. A sampled grating can be used for longer fibers but its coupling coefficient should be higher. The proposed scheme should prove useful for double-clad fiber lasers and amplifiers.},

By varying the injection power, period-one oscillation, period-two oscillation, and chaotic oscillation are observed in the injected slave laser, indicating a period-doubling route to chaos. Compared to the free-running output of the laser, its chaotic output has a drastically increased signal bandwidth, which leads to a 19?dB increase of the stimulated Brillouin scattering threshold. Using a chaos of 5.2?GHz bandwidth, a maximum optical power of 27?dBm is obtained after 20?km transmission over fiber, which is applicable to optically powering some advanced communication networks. The approach uses the inherent nonlinear laser dynamics, which requires no modulation electronics or microwave signal sources.},

So far a rare use of devices with heating cable for paraffin deposition prevention has resulted in an invention of a new technical solution. The developed device has an original way of very simple installation of the heating cable into the well, and so overcomes the main disadvantage of existing devices. Also, the device heating control unit precisely doses the needed amount of heat for oil heating that makes device energy efficient. Using of this technical solution increases well productivity by improvement of heavy oil rheological properties. The new device has been tested and the results are presented in this paper. It has been patented, and has won several awards.},

Graphs of the published data on common rocks and minerals were prepared to show the relationships of thermal conductivity with decimal solidity (one minus decimal porosity), water or air pore content, content of certain highly conducting minerals, and temperature. Tables are given of pressure effect on thermal conductivity of minerals and rocks, anisotropy of conductivity, thermal expansion, heat transfer, density, heat generation in rocks, and activation energies of conduction mechanisms in single crystals of minerals. A series of graphs show the specific heats of rock-forming minerals as a function of temperature; with these graphs the specific heat of a rock can be calculated from its mode as accurately as it can be measured. Calculations of conductivity, diffusivity, and thermal inertia of a rock from its mode are described. Discussions of radiative thermal conductivity, radioactive heat generation, and heat transfer in rocks are provided.},

abstract = {Warming heavy oil (940–1000 kg/m3, 10°–20° API) reduces its viscosity substantially; however, conventional thermal recovery by steam injection is not applicable to a number of heavy-oil reservoirs. This paper explores localized electric resistance heating provided by mineral-insulated cable and a novel heater–well arrangement. Two-dimensional (2-D) and heterogeneous three-dimensional (3-D) reservoir simulation models employing single- and dual-lateral completion horizontal wells illustrate that an electric resistance heating element with a modest power output enhances recovery several fold. Important parameters for improved recovery are (1) solution gas, (2) formation and fluid thermal conductivity that permits conductive heating, and (3) the ability to achieve relatively low bottom-hole pressure in production wells. Economic analysis suggests that the cost of electricity is about 1.25 USD per barrel of incremental oil.},

These experiments were repeated for other sandstones, and no strong effect was observed for flow of gas, mineral oil, or octanol. Under the hypothesis that a temperature level effect was caused by an attraction between water and quartz which increased with temperature increase, experiments were conducted with flow of water in both consolidated and unconsolidated sandstones. A large, reversible reduction in absolute permeability to water with temperature increase was observed, while no temperature level effect was observed for flow of gas or other non-aqueous fluids. It appears to the authors that temperature level may affect permeability to water in sandstone systems to an important degree. This should have important connotations to thermal oil recovery and geothermal fluid production.},

abstract = {A new computer program is described, GRINSP (geometrically restrained
inorganic structure prediction), which allows the exploration of
the possibilities of occurrence of 3-, 4-, 5- and 6-connected three-dimensional
networks. Hypothetical (as well as known structure) models for binary
compounds are produced with exclusive connection of polyhedra by
corners, such as [MX3] triangles in M2X3 formulation, [MX4] tetrahedra
in MX2 (zeolites or dense SiO2 polymorphs), [MX5] polyhedra in M2X5,
and finally [MX6] octahedra in MX3 polymorphs. Moreover, hypothetical
ternary compounds are built up by combinations of either two different
polyhedra or two different radii for two different cations adopting
the same coordination. The cost function is based on the agreement
of the model interatomic distances with ideal distances provided
by the user. The Monte Carlo algorithm first finds structure candidates
selected after the verification of the expected geometry, and then
optimizes the cell parameters and the atomic coordinates. A satellite
software (GRINS) uses the predicted models and produces the characteristics
of isostructural compounds which would be obtained by cationic substitutions.
A huge list of CIF files of hypothetical boron oxide polymorphs (including
nanotubes), zeolites, aluminium and 3d-element fluorides, fluoroaluminates,
borosilicates, titanosilicates, gallophosphates etc., is freely available

abstract = {Ultrafast crystal-to-liquid phase transition induced by femtosecond pulse laser excitation is an interesting material's behavior manifesting the complexity of light-matter interaction. There exist two types of such phase transitions: one occurs at a time scale shorter than a picosecond via a nonthermal process mediated by electron-hole plasma formation; the other at a longer time scale via a thermal melting process mediated by electron-phonon interaction. However, it remains unclear what material would undergo which process and why? Here, by exploiting the property of quantum electronic stress (QES) governed by quantum Hooke's law, we classify the transitions by two distinct classes of materials: the faster nonthermal process can only occur in materials like ice having an anomalous phase diagram characterized with dTm/dP {\textless} 0, where Tm is the melting temperature and P is pressure, above a high threshold laser fluence; while the slower thermal process may occur in all materials. Especially, the nonthermal transition is shown to be induced by the QES, acting like a negative internal pressure, which drives the crystal into a "super pressing" state to spontaneously transform into a higher-density liquid phase. Our findings significantly advance fundamental understanding of ultrafast crystal-to-liquid phase transitions, enabling quantitative a priori predictions.},

abstract = {While the classical, wavelike behavior of light (interference and diffraction) has been easily observed in undergraduate laboratories for many years, explicit observation of the quantum nature of light (i.e., photons) is much more difficult. For example, while well-known phenomena such as the photoelectric effect and Compton scattering strongly suggest the existence of photons, they are not definitive proof of their existence. Here we present an experiment, suitable for an undergraduate laboratory, that unequivocally demonstrates the quantum nature of light. Spontaneously downconverted light is incident on a beamsplitter and the outputs are monitored with single-photon counting detectors. We observe a near absence of coincidence counts between the two detectors—a result inconsistent with a classical wave model of light, but consistent with a quantum description in which individual photons are incident on the beamsplitter. More explicitly, we measured the degree of second-order coherence between the outputs to be g (2) (0)=0.0177±0.0026, which violates the classical inequality g (2) (0)⩾1 by 377 standard deviations.},

abstract = {We present a theoretical and experimental analysis of color-reflection holography. Full parallax three-dimensional color images are obtained by the superposition of wavelength-selective reflection holograms recorded at eight combinations of three laser wavelengths. The test object used was a set of eight Munsell color chips recommended by the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) for color-rendering analysis. The spectral power distributions of all the holographic images are measured using a telespectroradiometer and corresponding points are calculated and plotted on a color diagram. The holograms are modeled by a combination of sinc functions for the diffracted replay signal and an empirically determined function for the replay scatter noise. A new definition of signal-to-noise ratio for color holograms is described. The model is matched to a spectral power distribution by choosing values for relative diffraction efficiencies, bandwidth, signal-to-noise ratio, and wavelength shift components. One spectral power distribution having been matched, theoretical predictions of the remaining colors in the holographic images are obtained. The predictions mapped on the CIE 1976 diagram are shown to agree with experimental results: the average distance between theoretical and experimental points on the CIE diagram for all eight Munsell chips on all eight holograms is 0.0001 CIE 1976 chromaticity diagram unit; the discrepancy of the average gamut area between theoretical and experimental points on the CIE diagrams was {\textless} 10{\%}. Good agreement between theory and experiment having been shown, a synthesis of holographic color reproduction at any combination of wavelengths predicts optimum recording wavelengths of 460, 530, and 615 nm for typical replay by a color-reflection hologram.},

abstract = {We perform an experimental study of the phase and amplitude of microwaves interacting with and scattered by two-dimensional negative index metamaterials. The measurements are performed in a parallel plate waveguide apparatus at X-band frequencies (8-12 GHz), thus constraining the electromagnetic fields to two dimensions. A detection antenna is fixed to one of the plates, while a second plate with a fixed source antenna or waveguide is translated relative to the first plate. The detection antenna is inserted into, but not protruding below, the stationary plate so that fields internal to the metamaterial samples can be mapped. From the measured mappings of the electric field, the interplay between the microstructure of the metamaterial lattice and the macroscopic averaged response is revealed. For example, the mapped phase fronts within a metamaterial having a negative refractive index are consistent with a macroscopic phase-in accordance with the effective medium predictions-which travels in a direction opposite to the direction of propagation. The field maps are in excellent agreement with finite element numerical simulations performed assuming homogeneous metamaterial structures.},

abstract = {High power pulsed lasers are commonly deployed in harsh environments, like space flight and military missions, for a variety of systems such as LIDAR, optical communications over long distances, or optical firing of explosives. Fiber coupling of the laser pulse from the laser to where it is needed can often save size, reduce weight, and lead to a more robust and reliable system. Typical fiber optic termination procedures are not sufficient for injection of these high power laser pulses without catastrophic damage to the fiber endface. In the current study, we will review the causes of fiber damage during high power injection and discuss methods used to avoid these issues to permit fiber use with high reliability in these applications. A brief review of the design considerations for high peak power laser pulse injection will be presented to familiarize the audience with all the areas that need to be considered during the design phase. The majority of this paper focuses on the proper fiber polishing methods for high power use with an emphasis on laser polishing of the fibers. Results from recently build fibers will be shown to demonstrate the techniques. 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).},

abstract = {Zirconium alloys have been long used for fuel cladding and other structural components in water-cooled nuclear reactors, but waterside corrosion is a primary limitation on both high fuel burn-up and extended fuel cycle operation. Understanding the processes that occur at the metal/oxide interface is crucial for a full mechanistic description of the oxidation process. In this paper we show that reliable quantification of the oxygen content at the metal/oxide interface can be obtained by Electron Energy Loss Spectrometry (EELS) if enough care is taken over both the preparation of Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) samples and the methodology for quantification of the EELS data. We have reviewed the accuracy of theoretically calculated inelastic partial scattering cross-sections and effective inelastic mean-free-paths for oxygen and zirconium in oxidized Zr-alloy samples. After careful recalibration against a ZrO2 powder standard, systematic differences in the local oxygen profile across the interface in different zirconium alloys were found. The presence of a sub-stoichiometric oxide layer (a suboxide) was detected under conditions of slow oxide growth but not where growth was more rapid. This difference could arise from the different corrosion resistances of the alloys or, more likely, as a result of the transition in oxidation behaviour, which refers to a sharp increase in the oxidation rate when the oxide is a few microns thick.},

The minimum losses obtained are 35 dB/km at 2.44$\mu$m for As40S60unclad fiber, 182 dB/km at 2.12 $\mu$m for As38Ge5Se57unclad fiber, and 148 dB/km at 1.68 $\mu$m for Ge20S80unclad fiber. It is shown that hydrogen impurity absorptions and short-wavelength weak absorption tails seriously enhance loss in the fibers. It is also suggested that ultralow loss cannot be achieved due to the existence of the weak absorption tail. However, it is expected that the chalcogenide glass fibers can be used in short fiber-length applications such as in the remote monitoring and delivery of CO laser radiation. This is due to their wide operating wavelength ranges of0.9-6mum for As-S,1.3-9mum for As-Ge-Se, and0.8-5mum for Ge-S, in which losses can be reduced to below 1 dB/m.},

@article{Xu2003a,
abstract = {Application of advanced high power laser technology to oil and gas well drilling has been attracting significant research interests recently among research institutes, petroleum industries, and universities. Potential laser or laser-aided oil and gas well drilling has many advantages over the conventional rotary drilling, such as high penetration rate, reduction or elimination of tripping, casing, and bit costs, and enhanced well control, perforating and side-tracking capabilities. The energy required to remove a unit volume of rock, namely the specific energy (SE), is a critical rock property data that can be used to determine both the technical and economic feasibility of laser oil and gas well drilling, When a high power laser beam is applied on a rock, it can remove the rock by thermal spallation, melting, or vaporization depending on the applied laser energy and the way the energy is applied. The most efficient rock removal mechanism would be the one that requires the minimum energy to remove a unit volume of rock. Samples of sandstone, shale, and limestone were prepared for laser beam interaction with a 1.6 kW pulsed Nd:yttrium-aluminum-garnet laser beam to determine how the beam size, power, repetition rate, pulse width, exposure time and energy can affect the amount of energy transferred to the rock for the purposes of spallation, melting, and vaporization. The purpose of the laser rock interaction experiment was to determine the optimal parameters required to remove a maximum rock volume from the samples while minimizing energy input. Absorption of radiant energy from the laser beam gives rise to the thermal energy transfer required for the destruction and removal of the rock matrix. Results from the tests indicate that each L rock type has a set of optimal laser parameters to minimize specific energy (SE) values as observed in a set of linear track and spot tests. As absorbed energy outpaces heat diffusion by the rock matrix, local temperatures can rise to the melting points of the minerals and quickly increase observed SE values. Tests also clearly identified the spallation and melting zones for shale samples while changing the laser power. The lowest SE values are obtained in the spalling zone just prior to the onset of mineral melt. The laser thermally spalled and saw mechanically cut rocks show similarity of surface microstructure. The study also found that increasing beam repetition rate within the same material removal mechanism would increase the material removal rate, which is believed due to an increase of maximum temperature, thermal cycling frequency, and intensity of laser-driven shock wave within the rock.

abstract = {Recent developments in nonlinear optics have led to the discovery of a new class of ultrashort pulse, the 'optical similariton'. Optical similaritons arise when the interaction of nonlinearity, dispersion and gain in a high-power fibre amplifier causes the shape of an arbitrary input pulse to converge asymptotically to a pulse whose shape is self-similar. In comparison with optical solitons, which rely on a delicate balance of nonlinearity and anomalous dispersion and which can become unstable with increasing intensity, similaritons are more robust at high pulse powers. The simplicity and widespread availability of the components needed to build a self-similar amplifier capable of producing optical similaritons provides a convenient experimental platform to explore the fundamental nature of dynamical self-similarity. Here, we provide an overview of self-similar pulse propagation and scaling in optical fibre amplifiers, and their use in the development of high-power ultrafast optical sources, pulse synthesis and all-optical pulse regeneration.},

Experiments are conducted to determine the magnitude of the heat required to satisfy the thermal reactions and to compare this quantity with the heat required to raise the temperature of the rock excluding thermal reactions. The known heat of reaction for the quartz inversion and the known quartz content of Berea sandstone are used for standardization purposes. The comparison of experimentally determined heats of reaction for the three sandstones with the heat required to raise the temperature of the rock through the same temperature ranges without considering thermal reactions, shows that the reaction heat is 27{\%} of the total heat requirements for both Bandera and Berea sandstones. However, thermal reactions involving the release of adsorbed and combined water and the liberation of gases, such as carbon dioxide, may be different under subsurface conditions of liquid saturation and pore fluid pressure.},

abstract = {We present a reflection-type terahertz time-domain spectroscopic ellipsometry (THz-TDSE) technique for measuring the complex dielectric constants of thin-film materials without replacement of the sample. THz-TDSE provides complex dielectric constants from the ratio of the complex amplitude reflection coefficients between p- and s-polarized THz waves. The measured dielectric constants of doped GaAs thin films show good agreement with predictions of the Drude model, even though the film thickness is of the order of a tenth of the penetration depth of the THz waves. In addition, we demonstrate the measurements of soft-phonon dispersion in SrTiO(3) thin films deposited on a Pt layer. The obtained dielectric constants agree well with the predictions of a generalized harmonic oscillator model.},

@article{Levin2009,
abstract = {Although the orbits of comparable-mass, spinning black holes seem to defy simple decoding, we find a means to decipher all such orbits—in the absence of radiation reaction. The conservative dynamics is complicated by extreme perihelion precession compounded by spin-induced precession. We are able to quantitatively define and describe the fully three-dimensional motion of comparable-mass binaries with one black hole spinning and expose an underlying simplicity. To do so, we untangle the dynamics by capturing the motion in the orbital plane and explicitly separate out the precession of the plane itself. Our system is defined by the conservative third-order post-Newtonian Hamiltonian plus spin-orbit coupling for one spinning black hole with a nonspinning companion. Our results are twofold: (1) We derive highly simplified equations of motion in a nonorthogonal orbital basis, and (2) we define a complete taxonomy for fully three-dimensional orbits. More than just a naming system, the taxonomy provides unambiguous and quantitative descriptions of the orbits, including a determination of the zoom-whirliness of any given orbit. Through a correspondence with the rationals, we are able to show that zoom-whirl behavior is prevalent in comparable-mass binaries in the strong-field regime, as it is for extreme-mass-ratio binaries in the strong field. A first significant conclusion that can be drawn from this analysis is that all generic orbits in the final stages of inspiral under gravitational radiation losses are characterized by precessing clovers with few leaves, and that no orbit will behave like the tightly precessing ellipse of Mercury. The gravitational waveform produced by these low-leaf clovers will reflect the natural harmonics of the orbital basis—harmonics that, importantly, depend only on radius. The significance for gravitational wave astronomy will depend on the number of windings the pair executes in the strong-field regime. The third-order post-Newtonian system studied provides an example of a general method that can be applied to any effective description of black hole pairs.},

abstract = {Optical fibers have become ubiquitous tools for the creation, propagation, manipulation, and detection of light. However, while the intensity of light propagating through the fiber can increase or decrease along the length through amplification or attenuation, respectively, the properties of the fiber itself generally do not, thus removing an opportunity to further control the behavior of light and performance of fiber-based devices. Shown here are optical fibers that exhibit significant changes in their longitudinal optical properties, specifically a tailored longitudinal numerical aperture change of about 12{\%} over less than 20 meters of length. This is about 1900 times greater than previously reported. The Brillouin gain coefficient was found to decrease by over 6 dB relative to a standard commercial single mode fiber. Next generation analogs are expected to exhibit more than a 10 dB reduction in SBS gain using larger, yet still reasonably manufacturable gradients over practical lengths.},

 spatial variation of the medium is assumed to be in the depth coordinate, i.e. it is stratified. The
 constitutive relations of the medium are a time integral of a generalized susceptibility kernel and
 the field. The generalized susceptibility kernel depends on one spatial and two time coordinates.
 The concept of wave splitting is introduced. The direct and inverse scattering problems are solved
 by the use of an imbedding or a Green function approach. The direct and the inverse scattering
 problems are solved for a homogeneous semi-infinite medium. Explicit algorithms are developed. In
 this inverse scattering problem, a function depending on two time coordinates is reconstructed.
 Several numerical computations illustrate the performance of the algorithms.},

abstract = {Melting and vaporization phenomena during the laser drilling process are investigated in this paper. The locations of the solid-liquid and liquid-vapor interfaces were obtained by solving energy conservation equations at the interfaces. The dependence of saturation temperature on the back pressure is taken into account by using the Clausius/Clapeyron equation. The conduction heat loss to the solid is also included in the model and is solved by using an integral approximate method. The results show that the fraction of the heat lost through conduction to the solid is very small and its effect on the vaporization process is not significant. On the other hand, the conduction heat loss significantly reduces the thickness of the liquid layer, which becomes the recast layer after drilling.},

abstract = {TX 75083-3836, U.S.A., fax ϩ1-972-952-9435 Abstract During the last decades nanotechnology has proven to be applicable to a variety of different technological and research areas such as material design, biomedicine and electronics. The cross disciplinary research during the past decade has also revealed that nanotechnology possesses great promise for enhanced oil recovery applications. Nanoparticles are small particles characterized by a diameter of 1-1000 nm and a very large area-to-volume ratio where the surface can be modified by conjugation or grafting to various kinds of molecules. Moreover, the material of the nanoparticle core can be selected to obtain specific physical properties. One example hereof is to design nanoparticles of a super-paramagnetic material to enable flow manipulation via an external magnetic field. The fact that ultra-small nanoparticles can flow through narrow pores and pore-throats and that core/surface properties can be modified for a specific purpose via standard chemistry, makes them ideal candidates for various EOR applications. Consequently, research related hereto has been steadily intensified. In the present paper we present a thorough review of the current research and development within the field of nanotechnology-based EOR, where nanoparticles are used to target various aspects of EOR processes. For instance nanoparticle-based EOR approaches have been developed to promote wettability alteration, viscosity reduction of oil, stabilization of foam or emulsions and interfacial tension reduction – in some cases involving application of an external electric or magnetic field. Nanoparticles have likewise been developed for flow assurance and well performance improvement by e.g. inhibiting hydrate and wax deposition. Finally, nanoparticles have shown potential in upstream applications and reservoir characterization (e.g. nano sensors). Based on an extensive, critical and in-depth review of technical papers we will discuss opportunities and challenges, e.g. related to environmental issues, associated with nanoparticle-based EOR applications for the oil and gas industry. Moreover, we will provide a practical framework for designing tailor-made nanoparticles for targeted applications for the oil and gas industry by means of surface chemistry and superparamagnetic properties of nanoparticles.},

@article{Mutyala2010,
abstract = {This review provides a general overview of microwave applications in oil sands bitumen or shale oil production in petroleum upgrading. The vast oil reserves in the oil sands of Alberta will become a major source of petroleum products in the near future and a number of alternative technologies have been explored for the production and upgrading of oil sands and heavy oil. This study is based primarily on the unique selective heating capacity associated with exposure of materials to microwaves. Of particular interest are applications of microwaves for bitumen extraction, upgrading heavy oils, removing heteroatoms, and the underground heating of oil sands to reduce bitumen viscosity and allow it to be pumped to the surface. The fundamentally different method of transferring energy from the source to the sample is the main advantage of utilizing microwave energy. By directly delivering energy to microwave-absorbing materials, conventional issues such as long heating periods and energy loses can be minimized. Microwave energy was shown to be effective in some applications; however, it is not used commercially at the present time.},

abstract = {Novel telluride glasses with high electrical conductivity, wide infrared transparency and good resistance to crystallization are used to design an opto-electrophoretic sensor for detection and identification of hazardous microorganisms. The sensor is based on an attenuated total reflectance element made of Ge-As-Te glass that serves as both an optical sensing zone and an electrode for driving the migration of bio-molecules within the evanescent wave of the sensor. An electric field is applied between the optical element and a counter electrode in order to induce the migration of bio-molecules carrying surface charges. The effect of concentration and applied voltage is tested and the migration effect is shown to be reversible upon switching the electric field. The collected signal is of high quality and can be used to identify different bacterial genus through statistical spectral analysis. This technique therefore provides the ability to detect hazardous microorganisms with high specificity and high sensitivity in aqueous environments. This has great potential for online monitoring of water quality.},

Detailed prediction of the energy and angle distribution of emitted photons is made. The present result is shown to reduce to that obtained by Ferrell if $\epsilon$($\omega$) appropriate to a free electron gas is assumed and if one takes vi/c≪1, where vi is the speed of the incident particle.

This paper examines the effect of laser parameters on the quality of drilled holes in Alumina ceramics which are widely used in microelectronic devices, based on orthogonal array experimentation and response surface methodology. Both entrance and exit circularities were significantly influenced by hole diameter and laser power. Heat affected zone was influenced by frequency. Taper was also significantly influenced by laser power. Response surface model predicted nominal entrance circularity at 2.5 kHz, 240 W, 2.5 mm/s, 1 mm hole, exit circularity and taper at 7.5 kHz, 240 W, 4.5 mm/s, and 1 mm hole. The model predicted lowest heat affected zone at 7.5 kHz, 240 W, 2.5 mm/s, and 1 mm. Multiobjective optimization achieved using both response surface model and gray relational analysis indicated that all the four quality parameters are optimized at 7.5 kHz, 240 W, 3.85 mm/s and 1 mm. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

The high brightness compression of about 700 larger than the pumping power was also demonstrated under the high slope efficiency of 73{\%} slope efficiency. The broadband emission caused by the stimulated Raman effect due to the high intensity inside the core propagated in a manner of confined optical propagation. These results showed the great potential of fiber lasers for industrial applications. However, the double clad fiber laser has a limitation about the maximum output because of the finite input area of the first clad. The output of double clad fiber lasers is determined simply by the active volume. We discuss how to expand the potential of fiber lasers to the kW level. We are developing fiber-embedded disk and tube lasers. The pumping scheme of such a type of fiber lasers is side-pumping by LD arrays.},

abstract = {Effective thermal conductivity (ETC) of dry, gas-, oil-, and water-saturated rocks with various porosities has been measured over a temperature range from 273K to 523K at atmospheric pressure with a steady-state guarded parallel-plate apparatus. The expanded uncertainty of thermal conductivity and temperature measurements at the 95{\%} confidence level with a coverage factor of k=2 were estimated to be 4{\%} and 30mK, respectively. This uncertainty in ETC measurement does not include the uncertainty due to contact thermal resistance and radiative conductivity. The temperature coefficients, (∂ln$\lambda$/∂T)P, for fluid-saturated rocks were calculated by using the measured ETC. We interpreted measured ETC data for fluid-saturated rocks using various theoretical models in order to check their accuracy, predictive capability, and applicability. The effect of saturating fluids, structure (size, shape, and distribution of the pores), porosity, and mineralogical composition on temperature and porosity dependences of the ETC of fluid-saturated rocks was discussed. A new simple equation for ETC of fluid-saturated rocks which takes into account structure of porous media has been proposed. Using the Hofmiester model and measured thermal conductivities of dry rock materials, the values of thermodynamic properties (density, thermal expansion coefficient, enthalpy, and heat capacity) were predicted.},

abstract = {A model approach to the problem of the dynamics of the light-induced dichroism of a photochromic medium under conditions of optical excitation with time-dependent polarization and intensity is proposed. The approach developed has a simple geometric interpretation based on the Poincar{\'{e}} sphere method and is insensitive to the micromechanism of formation of the anisotropy. As an illustration, one of the experiments on slowing down and halting of light is analyzed and it is shown that the interpretation of the experimental data presented in that paper is erroneous.},

abstract = {The mechanisms of metastable photoinduced anisotropy and photorefraction in chalcogenide glasses are proposed based on increased polarizability of these materials (increased cubic susceptibility $\chi$(3)). Flexible intrinsic structural units (oppositely charged chalcogen pairs) are suggested to be the origin of photoinduced anisotropy, and account for its re-orientation reversibility. I suggest that inflexible, photo-created, charged cation trapping sites dominate the mechanism of photorefraction. An increase of photoinduced anisotropy in glasses doped with Pr3+ ions is reported and attributed to Pr3+-induced increase of polarizability of charged chalcogen pairs, when Pr3+ ions adhere to the negatively charged component of these pairs. The Boson peak in the Raman spectra of glasses increases with Pr3+-doping confirming an increase of polarizability of intrinsic structural units into which Pr3+ ions are incorporated. The Boson peak also increases after prolonged irradiation of chalcogenide glasses with near-gap-light indicating a light-induced creation of bonds with increased polarizability (e.g. broken bonds), which cause photorefraction. Fatigue of host and Pr3+-dopant photoluminescence in chalcogenide glasses induced by prolonged irradiation with near-gap-light is discussed in correlation with accompanying photorefraction.},

abstract = {The requirements and development of high-k dielectric films for application in storage cells of future generation flash and Dynamic Random Access Memory (DRAM) devices are reviewed. Dielectrics with k-value in the 9–30 range are studied as insulators between charge storage layers and control gates in flash devices. For this application, large band gaps ({\textgreater}6 eV) and band offsets are required, as well as low trap densities. Materials studied include aluminates and scandates. For DRAM metal–insulator–metal (MIM) capacitors, aggressive scaling of the equivalent oxide thickness (with targets down to 0.3 nm) drives the research towards dielectrics with k-values {\textgreater}50. Due to the high aspect ratio of MIMCap structures, highly conformal deposition techniques are needed, triggering a substantial effort to develop Atomic Layer Deposition (ALD) processes for the deposition of metal gates and high-k dielectrics. Materials studied include Sr- and Ba-based perovskites, with SrTiO3 as one of the most promising candidates, as well as tantalates, titanates and niobates.},

@article{Liberati1999,
abstract = {Several years ago Schwinger proposed a physical mechanism for sonoluminescence in terms of changes in the properties of the quantum-electrodynamic (QED) vacuum state. This mechanism is most often phrased in terms of changes in the Casimir Energy: changes in the distribution of zero-point energies and has recently been the subject of considerable controversy. The present paper further develops this quantum-vacuum approach to sonoluminescence: We calculate Bogolubov coefficients relating the QED vacuum states in the presence of a homogeneous medium of changing dielectric constant. In this way we derive an estimate for the spectrum, number of photons, and total energy emitted. We emphasize the importance of rapid spatio-temporal changes in refractive indices, and the delicate sensitivity of the emitted radiation to the precise dependence of the refractive index as a function of wavenumber, pressure, temperature, and noble gas admixture. Although the physics of the dynamical Casimir effect is a universal phenomenon of QED, specific experimental features are encoded in the condensed matter physics controlling the details of the refractive index. This calculation places rather tight constraints on the possibility of using the dynamical Casimir effect as an explanation for sonoluminescence, and we are hopeful that this scenario will soon be amenable to direct experimental probes. In a companion paper we discuss the technical complications due to finite-size effects, but for reasons of clarity in this paper we confine attention to bulk effects.},

Using a scanning electron microscope equipped with a lithography system, nano-gratings are written digitally with varying point spacing, line pitch, and electron dose. The spot size of the electron beam is ∼1 nm, but the finest structures that have been created in our arsenic sulphide films have lines with widths of 27 nm, separation of 7 nm, and heights from 80 to 250 nm. As the line pitch decreases, the best resolved spacing between the lines decreases until the lines blend into each other, much before the e-beam overlap. A discussion of the optimization of fabrication parameters is included.},

In these MOPAs, the final-stage high-power amplifier could operate with high efficiency of 70{\%} - 80{\%} and even more, and a high gain of over 20 dB in a near diffraction-limited beam. We could see at least 7 dB enhancement of the stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) threshold for the 402 W polarization-maintaining (PM) YDF. In fact, we did not see any sign of SBS even at the highest output power. We eventually observed SBS appearance at around 500 W for the non-PM YDF. The observed SBS strengths were far weaker than expected in theory unless we allowed for the Brillouin gain reduction from thermal Brillouin gain broadening induced by the quantum-defect heating.},

Quantum optics: an introduction aims to introduce a wide range of topics at a lower level suitable for advanced undergraduate and masters level students in physics. The text is divided into four main parts, covering modern topics in both pure and applied quantum optics: I Introduction and background material. II. Photons. III. Atom-photon interactions. IV. Quantum information processing. The emphasis of the subject development is on intuitive physical understanding rather than mathematical arguments, although many derivations are included where appropriate. The text includes numerous illustrations, with a particular emphasis on the experimental observations of quantum optical phenomena. Each chapter includes worked examples, together with 10-15 exercises with solutions. Six appendices are included to supplement the main subject material.},

Constrained to fabrication and [meta]material limitations, the refractive index, n, has been bounded to the range: {\$}0.8\backslashleq n(\backslashvec r)\backslashleq 3.5{\$}. Mappings are obtained through the inverse problem to the light geodesics equations, considering trappings by generalized orbit conditions defined $\backslash$emph{\{}a priori{\}}. Our simulation results show that the above mentioned refractive index distributions trap light in an open orbit manifold, both perennial and temporal, in regards to initial conditions. Moreover, due to their characteristics, these mappings could be advantageous to optical computing and telecommunications, for example, providing an on-demand time delay or optical memories. Furthermore, beyond their practical applications to photonics, these mappings set forth an attractive realm to construct a panoply of celestial mechanics analogies and experiments in the laboratory},

abstract = {Electron beam induced reliefs in Ge0.2Se0.8 thin films deposited by pulsed laser deposition on oxide coated silicon wafers are fabricated for the direct write of rib optical waveguides at telecommunication wavelengths. The physical dimensions of the reliefs are experimentally determined as a function of electron beam exposure conditions. Relief heights in excess of three times the initial film thickness are achieved. The lateral translation of the thin film material is observed to be of the order of tens of microns for relatively slow beam scan rates. Numerical simulations based on a full-wave finite element eigenmode analysis support the existence of single mode guided waves. The surface roughness of the optical waveguides, dominated by the pulse laser deposition process, is reduced to approximately 1 nm by planarization of the thin film, via thermal embossing, prior to electron beam exposure. A bidirectional writing scheme is implemented to remove variations in relief heights observed at waveguide terminations. Nonuniform electron beam exposures are used to demonstrate three-dimensional waveguide tapers useful for the realization of fiber-to-waveguide optical transitions.

@article{Sahni2000,
abstract = {The most widely used method of thermal oil recovery is by injecting steam into the reservoir. A well-designed steam injection project is very efficient in recovering oil, however its applicability is limited in many situations. Simulation studies and field experience has shown that low injectivity reservoirs and small thickness of the oil-bearing zone limit the performance of steam injection. This paper discusses alternative methods of transferring heat to heavy oil reservoirs, based on electromagnetic energy. We present a detailed analysis of low frequency electric resistive (ohmic) heating and higher frequency electromagnetic heating (microwave frequency). We show the applicability of electromagnetic heating in two example reservoirs. The first reservoir has thin sand zones separated by impermeable shale layers and viscous oil (9541 cp at initial reservoir conditions). We model preheating the reservoir with low frequency current using two horizontal electrodes, before injecting steam. The second reservoir has low permeability and oil viscosity of 33 cp at initial reservoir conditions. In this case we use a high frequency microwave antenna located 30 ft from the producing well as the heat source. Simulation results presented in this paper suggest that electromagnetic heating may be a good stimulation technique for heavy oil reservoirs with low injectivity or with thin payzones. We identify the parameters which are critical for electromagnetic heating. We also discuss past field applications of electromagnetic heating as well as technical challenges and limitations.},

The decrease of alpha-activity of the exposed solutions is accompanied by the deviation of gamma-activities of daughter nuclides of Uranium-232 from their equilibrium values.

abstract = {We discuss the potential functionalities of a mixed tellurite-chalcogenide glass where alternate oxygen atoms in a TeO(2) vitreous network are substituted with either sulfur or selenium atoms. We calculate the microscopic linear and nonlinear polarizabilities of chains with a finite number (n) of TeOX (X = S or Se) units from ab initio quantum chemistry computations and apply rotational averaging to the results. We find that the rotationally averaged linear polarizability, {\{}$\alpha${\}}(av), increases linearly with the number of units, while the second hyper-polarizability, {\{}$\gamma${\}}(av), grows as a power law with an exponent that changes from 1.2 to 1.9 and 2.4 when going from pure tellurite to S{\{}{\^{A}}{\}}{\{}{\~{}}{\}}substitution and Se{\{}{\^{A}}{\}}{\{}{\~{}}{\}}substitution, respectively. We then estimate the density of the resulting glass and local field corrections to obtain the macroscopic linear and nonlinear susceptibilities for a glass made from chains of n = 5. We find that the extra Te-S (or Te-Se) bonds in the mixed tellurite-chalcogenide system enhance the linear refractive index n(0) and the third-order susceptibility {\{}$\chi${\}}((3)) by factors of {\{}{\^{a}}{\}}*{\{}$\backslash$frac{\{}1{\}}{\{}4{\}}{\}} 1.3 (or 1.4) and {\{}{\^{a}}{\}}*{\{}$\backslash$frac{\{}1{\}}{\{}4{\}}{\}} 8 (or 14), respectively, over the base tellurite glasses (X = O).},

abstract = {Metamaterials are artificially engineered structures that have properties, such as a negative refractive index, not attainable with naturally occurring materials. Negative-index metamaterials (NIMs) were first demonstrated for microwave frequencies, but it has been challenging to design NIMs for optical frequencies and they have so far been limited to optically thin samples because of significant fabrication challenges and strong energy dissipation in metals. Such thin structures are analogous to a monolayer of atoms, making it difficult to assign bulk properties such as the index of refraction. Negative refraction of surface plasmons was recently demonstrated but was confined to a two-dimensional waveguide. Three-dimensional (3D) optical metamaterials have come into focus recently, including the realization of negative refraction by using layered semiconductor metamaterials and a 3D magnetic metamaterial in the infrared frequencies; however, neither of these had a negative index of refraction. Here we report a 3D optical metamaterial having negative refractive index with a very high figure of merit of 3.5 (that is, low loss). This metamaterial is made of cascaded 'fishnet' structures, with a negative index existing over a broad spectral range. Moreover, it can readily be probed from free space, making it functional for optical devices. We construct a prism made of this optical NIM to demonstrate negative refractive index at optical frequencies, resulting unambiguously from the negative phase evolution of the wave propagating inside the metamaterial. Bulk optical metamaterials open up prospects for studies of 3D optical effects and applications associated with NIMs and zero-index materials such as reversed Doppler effect, superlenses, optical tunnelling devices, compact resonators and highly directional sources.},

In this paper, we derive an expression for stress in continua with viscous and elastic properties in presence of external, static electric or magnetic fluids. Our derivation follows from fundamental thermodynamic principles. We demonstrate the soundness of our results by showing that they reduce to known expressions for Newtonian fluids and elastic solids. We point out the extra care to be taken while applying these techniques to permanently polarized or magnetized materials and derive an expression for stress in a ferro-fluid. Lastly, we derive expressions for ponderomotive forces in several situations of interest to fluid dynamics and rheology.},

The influence of laser irradiation time and rock saturation by water and heavy oil on the specific energy, the energy required to remove the unit weight of rock, used during Nd:YAG laser perforating. The results show that an increase in the laser irradiation time increases the depth of the rock hole as well as the specific energy used, with a nonlinear relationship. Here, the estimated equation of rate of penetration as a function of the specific energy (SE) is free from saturation effects. The type of saturation influences the specific energy; the amount of SE required for water saturated samples is more than that required for the heavy oil saturated samples, and heavy oil saturated samples needed more SE than the dry samples. ?? 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {From the sudden expansion of a cloud of gas or the cooling of a hot metal, to the unfolding of a thought in our minds and even the course of life itself, everything is governed by the four Laws of Thermodynamics. These laws specify the nature of 'energy' and 'temperature', and are soon revealed to reach out and define the arrow of time itself: why things change and why death must come. In this Very Short Introduction Peter Atkins explains the basis and deeper implications of each law, highlighting their relevance in everyday examples. Using the minimum of mathematics, he introduces concepts such as entropy, free energy, and to the brink and beyond of the absolute zero temperature. These are not merely abstract ideas: they govern our lives. In this concise and compelling introduction Atkins paints a lucid picture of the four elegant laws that, between them, drive the Universe. ABOUT THE SERIES: The Very Short Introductions series from Oxford University Press contains hundreds of titles in almost every subject area. These pocket-sized books are the perfect way to get ahead in a new subject quickly. Our expert authors combine facts, analysis, perspective, new ideas, and enthusiasm to make interesting and challenging topics highly readable.},

abstract = {Lasers are widely used in industry as cutting tools due to ultra flexibility of the cutting conditions, obtaining high quality end product, quick set up, non-mechanical contact between the workpiece and the tool, and small size of the heat affected zone. In the present study, laser gas assisted cutting process is examined. Statistical method based on factorial analysis is introduced to identify the influence of cutting parameters on the resulting cut quality. International standards for thermal cutting is employed to identify the measurable variables when assessing the cut quality. Kerf width size is presented using scaling laws. Contribution of high temperature oxidation reaction in cutting due to assisting gas is accommodated in the analysis. First and second law efficiencies for laser cutting process are formulated. An experiment is conducted to assess the cutting quality and validate the Kerf width predictions. It is found that increasing laser beam scanning speed reduces the Kerf width while Kerf width increases with increasing laser output power. The main effects of all the parameters employed have significant influence on the resulting cutting quality. First law efficiency increases with increasing laser scanning speed, which substantiates as the workpiece thickness is doubled.},

Despite these problems, current single mode and multimode chalcogenide glass fibers are enabling numerous applications. Some of these applications include laser power delivery, chemical sensing, imaging, scanning near field microscopy/spectroscopy, fiber IR sources/lasers, amplifiers and optical switches.

We describe the calculation of these material properties for coordinate transformations that describe spaces with spherical or cylindrical holes in them. The resulting material properties can then implement invisibility cloaks in flat space. We also describe a method for performing geometric ray tracing in these materials which are both inhomogeneous and anisotropic in their electric permittivity and magnetic permeability.},

@article{Poopanya2011,
abstract = {The doping level dependence of thermoelectric properties of delafossite CuAlO2 has been investigated in the constant scattering time (tau) approximation, starting from the first principles of electronic structure. In particular, the lattice parameters and the energy band structure were calculated using the total energy plane-wave pseudopotential method. It was found that the lattice parameters of CuAlO2 are a = 2.802 and c = 16.704 , and the internal parameter is u = 0.1097. CuAlO2 has an indirect band gap of 2.17 eV and a direct gap of 3.31 eV. The calculated energy band structures were then used to calculate the electrical transport coefficients of CuAlO2. By considering the effects of doping level and temperature, it was found that the Seebeck coefficient S(T) increases with increasing acceptor doping (A (d)) level. The values of S(T) in our experiments correspond to an A (d) level at 0.262 eV, which is identified as the Fermi level of CuAlO2. Based on our experimental Seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity, the constant relaxation time is estimated to be 1 x 10(-16) s. The power factor is large for a low A (d) level and increases with temperature. It is suggested that delafossite CuAlO2 can be considered as a promising thermoelectric oxide material at high doping and high temperature.},

The design of a cloak uses transformation optics, in which a conformal coordinate transformation is applied to Maxwell's equations to obtain a spatially distributed set of constitutive parameters that define the cloak. Here, we present an experimental realization of a cloak design that conceals a perturbation on a flat conducting plane, under which an object can be hidden. To match the complex spatial distribution of the required constitutive parameters, we constructed a metamaterial consisting of thousands of elements, the geometry of each element determined by an automated design process. The ground-plane cloak can be realized with the use of nonresonant metamaterial elements, resulting in a structure having a broad operational bandwidth (covering the range of 13 to 16 gigahertz in our experiment) and exhibiting extremely low loss. Our experimental results indicate that this type of cloak should scale well toward optical wavelengths.},

abstract = {Accurate experimental determination of the effective thermal conductivity (ETC) of porous reservoir rocks (especially under high temperature and pressure conditions) is a difficult problem and often a time-consuming and costly process. This study firstly examines the ability of the theoretical and empirical correlations for estimating the air saturated sandstone, quartz and limestone ETCs based on the models available in the literature. Optimal values of constant parameters of these correlations are found using the genetic algorithm (GA) technique. Empirical correlations have acceptable accuracy; however, they are not applicable in wide ranges of temperature and/or pressure. Also, each equation is dependent on the composition of the porous rock. In other words, they are not generalized correlations. The ability of artificial neural networks (ANN) and adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) as two generalized models are also investigated utilizing 872 experimental data points for a wide range of pressure and temperature. Temperature, pressure, porosity and bulk density are considered as the inputs of the mentioned models. An optimal topology of multi-layer perceptron neural network model (MLPNN) is determined via 10-fold cross-validation method. The total average absolute relative deviation (AARD ({\%})) of the developed ANN and ANFIS models for estimation of ETC are obtained 2.91{\%} and 3.80{\%}, respectively. The results show that the optimal ANN model is able to estimate ETC with the higher accuracy than the other correlations.},

abstract = {The implicit solution of the geometric optics equations (i.e. the modulation equations arising from the WKB Ansatz) of the defocusing nonlinear Schr{\"{o}}dinger (NLS) equation is known to be expressible in terms of the classical hodograph transform. In this note, the solution procedure for the 2×2 system of quasilinear modulation equations is implemented, analogous to the implicit solution of the inviscid Burgers' equation, for smooth monotone initial data consistent with the modulation Ansatz. The implicit system is solved exactly using a classical method of Riemann. The relevant Riemann–Green functions can be found explicitly, hence allowing the exact location and time of shock formation to be calculated. The entire evolution of the exact solution can be observed through the shock formation.},

abstract = {Experimental measurements show that the phase transmittance characteristics of a photographic material, caused by relief images and variations of refractive index, can be fairly reproducible if processing is properly controlled. To manipulate these characteristics, particularly those of bleached materials, it would be desirable to have data for the phase image corresponding to the density-log exposure curve and the MTF curve of the density image obtained by conventional processing. A method is described for obtaining both curves from measurements of optical path variation of sinusoidally exposed images. Components from both the relief image and the variation of refractive index can be determined. It is shown that such data for a bleached photographic material can be used to produce an optical path variation having an arbitrary profile.},

@article{Hossan2012a,
abstract = {Electromagnetic heating such as microwave processing and radio frequency heating becomes very popular because of its non-contact, pollution free and fast distribution of thermal energy within the object of interest. In electromagnetic heating, the temperature distribution within a sample greatly depends on the dielectric properties which are functions of electromagnetic frequency, temperature and the composition of the object. There are many experimental and numerical investigations on electromagnetic heating because of its widespread use in food and other industries, but only few researchers have looked at this problem from analytic point of view specifically for the temperature dependent properties. In this paper, we developed an analytic expression for temperature distribution in a three dimensional rectangular object under electromagnetic heating and presented a method to incorporate temperature dependent properties of the object in determining the temperature distribution at different times. A simplified Maxwell's equation is solved for plane wave to obtain electric field distribution in the body, and the electromagnetic power absorption is computed from the electric field distribution which was then used as a source term in the energy equation. Next an unsteady, three dimensional, non-homogenous energy equation is solved by integral transform technique to obtain temperature distribution. Finally, this closed form analytical solution is used to study the effects of electromagnetic frequency, dielectric properties, and heat transfer coefficient on temperature distribution in a rectangular salmon fillet. It is found that incident frequency, sample thickness and processing time have significant influence on the heating pattern. For radio frequency heating, the temperature dependent dielectric properties influence the temperature distribution significantly, but the effect of temperature dependent dielectric properties is less dominant for the microwave frequency used in the household microwave oven. Our results also show that microwave heating provides heterogeneous temperature distribution with alternate hot and cold spots. On the other hand, the radio frequency heating allows almost uniform temperature distribution within the body, which makes it a better choice for quick and convenient heating process especially for commercial and industrial heating. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The transfer of energy between two adjacent parts of rock mainly depends on its thermal conductivity. Present study supports the use of artificial neural network (ANN) and adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) in the study of thermal conductivity along with other intrinsic properties of rock due to its increasing importance in many areas of rock engineering, agronomy and geo environmental engineering field. In recent years, considerable effort has been made to develop techniques to determine these properties. Comparative analysis is made to analyze the capabilities among six different models of ANN and ANFIS. ANN models are based on feedforward backpropagation network with training functions resilient backpropagation (RP), one step secant (OSS) and Powell-Beale restarts (CGB) and radial basis with training functions generalized regression neural network (GRNN) and more efficient design radial basis network (NEWRB). A data set of 136 has been used for training different models and 15 were used for testing purposes. A statistical analysis is made to show the consistency among them. ANFIS is proved to be the best among all the networks tried in this case with average absolute percentage error of 0.03{\%} and regression coefficient of 1, whereas best performance shown by the FFBP (RP) with average absolute error of 2.26{\%}. Thermal conductivity is predicted using P-wave velocity, porosity, bulk density, uniaxial compressive strength of rock as input parameters. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

A kinetic model is presented to quantitatively explain the sidewall roughness evolution during thermal reflow. Further, we develop a technique to calculate waveguide optical loss using the roughness evolution model, and predict the ultimate low loss limit in reflowed high-index-contrast glass waveguides. Up to 50{\%} optical loss reduction after reflow treatment is experimentally observed, and the practical loss limiting factors are discussed.},

The paper substantially reviewed the progress made and the fundamental issues related to catalysts development. The most appropriate catalysts are those containing strong, active sites that can actively break the CC, CS, CO and related bonds in resins and asphaltenes, with a net increase in the concentration of saturates and lighter aromatic hydrocarbons. Solid catalysts based on natural zeolites, heteropoly acids and modified zirconia oxides have so far demonstrated excellent activities. Catalysts such as alloys of Mo, W, C and Ni, nano oxides of Cu and Fe, Ni-chelates, supported nano-Fe particles and Cu2+ and Fe3+ complexes of toluene sulfonic acid were also recently reported as good candidates for the aquathermolysis reactions. Hydrophobic zeolites prepared in the fluoride or organic silane routes, carbides of W and Mo are prospective catalysts for the future due to their excellent performance in related reactions. In all cases, further studies are required to explore the optimal catalyst synthesis procedures, operation conditions and actual reaction mechanisms.},

However, current methods usually require high temperatures, long reaction duration, and cause serious environmental pollution. This study shows that by using carbon nanocatalysts, heavy crude oil can be efficiently upgraded to lighter oil at a relatively low temperature of about 150 °C. The temperature of crude oil was increased by microwave heating. The technique proposed in this study has the following advantages: (1) great viscosity reduction ratio over 96{\%}, (2) short reaction time (less than 1 h), (3) low required temperature, and (4) long viscosity regression time. Because of these advantages, upgrading heavy crude oil to light oil can be cheaper and more environment-friendly.},

The results are applied to the most common experimental situations: a semi‐infinite sample (i) bounded by a vacuum or (ii) covered by a conducting film, and a sample in the form of a film (iii) unsupported or (iv) covering a conducting substrate. The results are compared to some experimental data concerning, for instance, electromigration and electron‐stimulated desorption. In surface analysis the decay of the Auger signal from ions of opposite charges and the opposite behavior of ions of the same charge are explained. Similar effects observed in electron‐probe microanalysis of glasses are also elucidated. The results concern scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and electron‐beam lithography applied to biological objects, polymers, ceramics, minerals, glasses, and electronic devices. With slight modifications, the same model can be applied to cases of irradiation with ions or x rays. The evolution of the trapped charges with time is suggested, and the need to indicate the electric parameters (ϵ and $\gamma$) of the investigated samples is outlined.},

In this paper, the energy dissipation based on irradiation-assisted atomic rearrangement was found to be a crucial mechanism for irradiation-induced crystallization. The occurrence of crystallization needs to meet two criteria: (i) that the irradiation enhances the atomic order and (ii) that the crystalline nuclei are structurally stable. This work provides a general answer as to why the external energy deposition into an amorphous system could cause the lowering of free energy and trigger the athermal transformation from the amorphous to the crystalline state. Based on the energy dissipation assumption and the modified Lindemann model, the underlying relationship between irradiation-induced crystallization and amorphization was clarified.},

The results show that, LASER or LASER-aided oil and gas well drilling has many potential advantages over conventional rotary drilling, including high penetration rate, reduction or elimination of tripping, casing, bit costs, enhanced well control, as well as perforating and side-tracking capabilities. The investigation also reveals that modern infrared LASERs have a higher rate of rock cuttings removal than that of conventional rotary drilling and flame-jet spallation. It also reveals that LASER can destroy rock without damaging formation permeability but rather, it enhances or improves permeability and that permeability and porosity increases in all rock types. The paper has therefore provided more knowledge on the potential value to drilling operations and techniques using LASER.},

 a small proportion of Ag–As bonds ( N AgAs {\#}{\#}IMG{\#}{\#} [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {\{}≈{\}}
 0.3) are formed in all three ternary compositions, while the direct Ag–Ag bonds ( N AgAg {\#}{\#}IMG{\#}{\#}
 [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/ap.gif] {\{}≈{\}} 0.4) appear only in the glass with the highest Ag
 content (12 at.{\%}). Similar to the g - As 2 S 3 binary, the mean coordination number of arsenic is
 close to three, and that of sulfur is close to two, in the As 2 S 3 –Ag ternary glasses. The first
 sharp diffraction peak on the total structure factors of As 2 S 3 binary and (As 0.4 S 0.6 ) 100− x
 Ag x ternary glasses is related to the As–As and As–S correlations.},

The welding parameters normally associated with continuous wave lasers are laser power, beam diameter and welding speed. In pulsed wave lasers the parameters used are pulse duration, energy and beam diameter. In this paper a comparison of welds obtained using the same process parameters in continuous and pulsed wave lasers is made. In order to have the same welding parameters, for both lasers, the tests were carried out using interaction time and power density as the main process parameters. The results show that when these parameters are used the two lasers show very dissimilar behaviours in terms of penetration depth. Also the pulsed wave laser showed higher efficiency when compared to the continuous wave laser under the same welding conditions. The effect of the peak power density was also evaluated. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Low power laser beam of Free Electron Laser (FEL) has been shown in literature to be used to penetrate different reservoir carbonate rocks and shales. The corresponding specific energies and ROPs are measured when a work in this field is performed. Laser beam is shown to be capable of drilling boreholes because of the high energy it can create. Laser is shown to drill shales while preventing the clay swelling problem prevailing when water is in contact with shales. Laser can also increase the accuracy of perforation of casing strings. In works like, the core samples to be tested are usually taken from fields and analyzed. Comparison of different laser modes in terms of specific energy and ROP increase has been investigated and presented as a literature review which has not been accounted for in many previous works. As the future work, shape and rock type should be considered although there exists many works in literature wherein these parameters have been neglected.},

abstract = { There has been considerable interest recently in high power microwave (HPM) sources for nonlethal directed energy weaponry applications. Many of these sources that are being developed are derivatives of sources that are well known to the vacuum electronics community. Others are unique to the HPM community and have no analog in traditional microwave sources. For electronic attack (referred to in the media as the "e-bomb"), HPM sources are being developed that provide peak powers that exceed 1 GW at frequencies on the order of 1 GHz in short pulses, typically on the order of 100 ns. The technology that is used to drive such sources has its roots in pulsed power, and a comprehensive understanding of their behavior requires the use of tools that have been developed in the plasma physics community. The ever-increasing reliance on the use of microprocessors that have increasing density of circuits packaged on a chip makes such systems increasingly vulnerable to HPM. This paper provides an overview of HPM sources, their applications, and will highlight areas of intense, ongoing research activity.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe the experimental laser perforation of rock. The different depth of laser penetration in the experiment demonstrated that the most important variables affecting perforation were laser power and irradiation time. The interaction mechanism between laser and rock during perforation was investigated. This investigation was conducted using an optical microscope, high-speed video images, X-ray diffractometer and other methodologies. The results indicated that the vapor/plasma of laser perforation was in a mutative process, displaying that complicated physical and chemical reactions were proceeding. A change in the molten pool during laser perforation was dynamic over time, involving heat transfer, heat radiation and instantaneous phase transition. Overheated energy in the molten pool led to material spatter which spilled from the perforation, a result of the recoil pressure of atomic vapor. XRD results revealed that the phases of rock after perforation mainly consisted of SiO2 and Fe2O3. During laser perforation, by employing either a continuous zooming process with a side blow or increasing the number of laser perforation passes with a side blow can significantly increase the depth of laser perforation.},

The grids are logically rectangular and the computational domain is a single Cartesian grid. Compared to alternative approaches based on a multiblock data structure or unstructured triangulations, this approach simplifies the implementation of numerical methods and the use of adaptive refinement. A more general domain with a smooth boundary can be gridded by composing one of the mappings from this paper with another smooth mapping from the circle or sphere to the desired domain. Although these grids are highly nonorthogonal, we show that the high-resolution wave-propagation algorithm implemented in clawpack can be used effectively to approximate hyperbolic problems on these grids.

abstract = {Complementary NAND and NOR gates composed of p-channel HgTe-nanocrystal (NC) films and n-channel HgSe-NC films were constructed on back-gate patterned plastic substrates. The NAND gate was made of two HgTe-p-channel thin film transistors (TFTs) in parallel and two HgSe-n-channel TFTs in series. The NOR gate was built up with both two HgSe-n-channel TFTs in parallel and two HgTe-p-channel TFTs in series. The mobility and on/off ratio for the p-channel TFTs were estimated to be 0.9 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) and 10, respectively, and those for the n-channel TFTs were measured to be 1.8 cm(2) V(-1) s(-1) and 10(2), respectively. The NAND and NOR gates were operated with gains of 1.45 and 1.63 and transition widths of 7.8 and 6.2 V, respectively, at room temperature in air. In addition, the operations of the NAND and NOR logics are reproducible for up to 1000 strain cycles.},

abstract = {This paper presents a new phase transition model that is easily created and runs rapidly. It is designed so that the modeler can determine immediately the relative accuracy of the end result by use of physics first principles. Phase transitions are readily observable in many commonly utilized engineering materials. In fact, most modern devices and/or tools employ a phase transition in their manufacture. This model demonstrates the ease of use that is inherent in COMSOL model development. This model builds on earlier COMSOL phase transition modeling examples. Examples are presented here of variations in the model parameters by using four different eutectic metal alloys in separate model runs. Such alloys are commonly employed to achieve both a strong mechanical contact and a high conductivity electrical contact. Variations of this model will allow the tracking of the phase boundary as a function of time.},

abstract = {We report a detailed analysis of experimental parameters and fundamental mechanisms contributing to the strong nonlinear scattering of femtosecond and short picosecond laser pulses (50-6000 fs) at focusing in ambient air and protecting gases. The experimental conditions under consideration are typical for a variety of applications: micromachining of metals and dielectrics, high power laser exposure of targets. Such scattering, being the most noticeable manifestation of the complex phenomenon of conical emission in the focusing geometry, puts fundamental limitations to the incident power of precision laser targeting, restricting in this way potential productivity of micromachining in this pulse width range. The phenomena analyzed here are: ionization, the optical Kerr effect, the distortion of spectra via self-phase modulation, and the refractive ability of microplasma, namely the scattering. Characteristics of the last were investigated with respect to the incident wavelength and pulse width, for focusing of Gaussian and flat-top beams of different diameters. The obtained extensive data allowed us to trace the clue trends and relationships of this phenomenon and to find several ways to reduce or even eliminate the scattering in a broad range of the incident energies.},

Water and ethanol are used as saturating fluids. Anomalous changes in thermophysical properties due to the formation of ice during freezing-thawing cycles are directly compared with the unfrozen ethanol-saturated state at the same temperatures. In addition, the thermal conductivity of Sander sandstone in different moist states over the humidity range of 10{\%}-90{\%} is determined at 25°C. The moisture transport in Sander sandstone is discussed in terms of the sorption curve. The porosity and density measurements on Sander sandstone are done according to the American Society of Testing and Materials (ASTM) standards at ambient conditions. Furthermore, surface and internal pore structures are analyzed by using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). All experimental results are obtained by using a state-of-the-art transient hot-bridge sensor. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Production from heavy oil reservoirs has always been a challenge due mainly to one factor in particular high oil viscosity, implying low oil mobility within porous media. Different methods have been implemented over the years in order to reduce oil viscosity. Well-known methods include steam injection (e.g., Steam Drive, Steam Assisted Gravity- SAGD), CO2 injection, chemical injection etc. These types of application are mainly applied to onshore fields where space is available and operating costs are much lower with respect to offshore fields. Moreover they may not be feasible for shallow reservoirs where injection could be an issue due to uncertainties regarding the cap-rock sealing. The scope of this paper is to present a patented non- conventional EOR method for heavy oil reservoirs using radio frequency/microwave heating. An adequate completion design and well-reservoir connection is used for heating the oil, thus solving the problems that impede RadioFrequency /MicroWave (RF/MW) penetration into the reservoir. Consequently, oil viscosity may be reduced, thus allowing its continuous production to surface (eventually by means of an artificial lift system included in the well completion). This method could be also suitable for offshore fields because it doesn't require high energy consumption, or large surface areas, or high operating costs. It can also be suitable for those shallow reservoirs not suitable for injection processes. This paper presents details of this new technology and associated simulation results showing its range of implementation.},

abstract = {In ray tracing, it is standard practice to consider solely the real part of any medium's refractive index for determining the changes in a ray's direction at the interface between two media. Any absorption is accounted for by reducing the intensity or weight of the ray in accordance with its propagation distance. This practice is adequate at optical wavelengths where absorption is generally very low but in the infrared and other regimes absorption can be significant and refraction angles and reflectances can deviate substantially from lossless cases. We calculate the quantitative consequence of a more rigorous approach to ray tracing for a lossy wedge and explore the potential differences in results from a Monte Carlo simulation of reflection from a rough, lossy surface. Comparisons between the traditional and complex ray tracing approaches are made and show that there can be significant discrepancies. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This work presents an overview of high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HRSTEM) techniques and exemplifies the novel quantitative characterization possibilities that have emerged from recent advances in these methods. The synergistic combination of atomic resolution imaging and spectroscopy provided by HRSTEM is highlighted as a unique feature that can provide a comprehensive analytical description of material properties at the nanoscale. State-of-the-art high-angle annular dark field and annular bright field examples are depicted as well as the use of X-ray energy-dispersive spectroscopy and electron energy-loss spectroscopy for probing samples properties at the atomic scale. In addition, promising techniques such as cathodoluminescence, confocal HRSTEM, and diffraction mapping are introduced. The presented examples and results indicate that HRSTEM-related techniques are fundamental tools for comprehensive assessment of properties at the atomic scale.},

A system of non-linear PDE(s) for the movement of each of the phases is coupled with heat transfer equation to account for heat diffusion through the media. The deposit is heated volumetrically and locally by using in- situ RF technology that was developed by Pyrophase, Inc. The effects of variation in properties of bitumen and reservoir media due to temperature and pressure are considered. These properties are derived from experimental data (e.g. viscosity, capillary pressure and relative permeability) obtained from earlier measurements by IIT Research Institute (IITRI). The Van Genuchen model is used to relate the data to the parameters in the two-phase model. The COMSOL system demonstrates acceptable capability and flexibility in solving the equations and setting logical boundary and initial conditions to model flow under conditions of temperature and pressure variation},

abstract = {Generally, light becomes scattered in space and time as it is coupled among multiple spatial paths during propagation through disordered media or multimode waveguides. This limits the pulse duration and spatial coherence that can be obtained after light exits such a medium. Eisenbud–Wigner–Smith eigenstates, originally proposed in nuclear scattering, are a unique set of input/output states that, despite spatiotemporal scattering during propagation, arrive at the output temporally unscattered. In fibre optics, these states manifest as principal modes that allow pulses and spatial coherence to be maintained despite propagation through a medium that would otherwise have destroyed these properties. These states generalize the phenomena of orthogonal fast/slow axes in a birefringent object to a basis with N axes, where N is the total number of spatial/polarization modes in the scattering medium. We experimentally demonstrate the existence of principal modes using a 100 m length of multimode fibre as the propagation medium.},

This is achieved by both optimizing the incident excitation beam polarization and spatial profile of excitation. Due to boundary conditions of the electric field at the electrode edge, a nanometer-sized polarization-dependent shadow is created in the substrate at the electrode edge where most picosecond lifetime photocarriers are collected. This edge effect is further harnessed by elongating the excitation beam next to the stripline electrode. The effects of excitation beam polarization and spatial profile were experimented with InGaAs/InAlAs quantum-well-based photoconductive switch. In both cases notable enhancement in the signal is observed - 30{\%} with polarization optimization and up to 100{\%} with beam elongation. Both techniques preserve the pulse quality and are applicable with readily available optical elements. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {With the development of ultra-intense laser technology, MeV ions can be obtained from laser-foil interactions in the laboratory. These energetic ion beams can be applied in fast ignition for inertial confinement fusion, medical therapy, and proton imaging. However, these ions are mainly accelerated in the laser propagation direction. Ion acceleration in an azimuthal orientation was scarcely studied. In this research, a doughnut Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) laser is used for the first time to examine laser-plasma interaction in the relativistic intensity regime in three-dimensional particle-in-cell simulations. Studies have shown that a novel rotation of the plasma is produced from the hollow screw-like drill of an mode laser. The angular momentum of particles in the longitudinal direction produced by the LG laser is enhanced compared with that produced by the usual laser pulses, such as linearly and circularly polarized Gaussian pulses. Moreover, the particles (including electrons and ions) can be trapped and uniformly compressed in the dark central minimum of the doughnut LG pulse. The hollow-structured LG laser has potential applications in the generation of x-rays with orbital angular momentum, plasma accelerators, fast ignition for inertial confinement fusion, and pulsars in the astrophysical environment.},

abstract = {This paper presents evaluation of thermal residual stresses in the heat affected zone of laser drilled alumina ceramic by using Micro-Raman spectroscopy. The residual stresses were evaluated for the holes corresponding to the optimal parameters of laser power, scanning speed, frequency and hole diameter. Three such cases were considered for the study. Residual stresses were obtained as a function of the Raman shifts. The nature and magnitude of the residual stresses were indicative of the extent of damage caused in the heat affected zone. In cases where the initial tensile residual stresses exceeded the tensile strength of alumina, cracks were initiated. Laser drilling with higher laser power and lower scanning speed induced initially high compressive and cyclic thermal stresses, causing greater damage to the hole. Transient thermal analysis was performed using COMSOL Multiphysics to predict residual thermal stresses and to validate the micro-Raman results. Scanning Electron Microscopy was used to confirm the damage caused in the heat affected zone.},

abstract = {A stochastic cellular automata simulator capable of spatiotemporal modeling of the crystallization and amorphization behavior of phase-change materials during the complex annealing cycles used in optical and electrical memory applications is presented. This is based on consideration of bulk and surface energies to generate rates of growth and decay of crystallites built up from “monomers” that may themselves be quite complex molecules. The approach uses a stochastic Gillespie-type time-stepping algorithm to deal with events that may occur on a very wide range of time scales. The simulations are performed at molecular length scale and using an approximation of local free energy changes that depend only on immediate neighbors. The approach is potentially capable of spanning the length scales between ab initio atomistic modeling methods, such as density functional theory, and bulk-scale methods, such the Johnshon–Mehl–Avrami–Kolmogorov formalism. As an example the model is used to predict the crystallization behavior in the chalcogenide Ge2Sb2Te5 alloy commonly used in phase-change memory devices. The simulations include annealing cycles with nontrivial spatial and temporal variations in temperature, with good agreement to experimental incubation times at low temperatures while modeling nontrivial crystal size distributions and melting dynamics at higher temperatures},

The model has two applications. First, as a new fundamental structural model to produce composite models using the combinatory rules previously proposed by J.F. Wang, J.K. Carson, M.F. North, D. J. Cleland, A new approach to modelling the effective thermal conductivity of heterogeneous materials, International Journal of Heat and Mass Transfer, 49 (17–18) (2006) 3075–3083.

If this spectrum comprises substantially only waves whose propagation constant is very close to the plane wave propagation constant, the field can be resolved into a set of elementary wave beams which are characterized by Laguerre polynomials. They satisfy orthogonality relations like the wave modes in a waveguide. The elementary beams or "beam modes" can be reiterated and guided by reconstituting the cross-sectional phase distribution at certain intervals. Reiterative beams are utilized in the beam waveguide. The finite size of the phase resetting devices effects a modification of the reiterative beam modes and causes diffraction losses. These losses decrease very rapidly with increasing diameter of the phasing devices.},

Different types of “aqueous” methods such as cyclic steam and hot water injection, in-situ combustion, hot water and steam flooding, and steam assisted gravity drainage have been widely applied over decades. Currently, non-aqueous heating methods, generally named electromagnetic, are in consideration as an alternative to the aqueous methods, which may not be applicable due to technical and environmental limitations. This technique still requires further research and field scale pilot applications to prove their technical and economic viability. In this paper, a critical discussion on the review of electromagnetic heating is presented. An attempt is undertaken to review most of the research works (computational and experimental as well as a limited number of field applications) performed over more than five decades. After evaluating aqueous and non-aqueous thermal methods, a comparative analysis is presented.},

abstract = {We report on first-principles band-structure calculations of the semiconducting CuAlO 2 delafossite compound in the pure form and also with Cd impurity occupying either a Cu or Al position. The computational tool was a full-potential linear augmented plane-wave method, with the generalized gradient approximation accounting for the exchange and correlation effects. The changes caused by the presence of Cd are studied by the analysis of the electronic structure and the electric field gradient (EFG) in both Cd-doped and pure CuAlO 2 systems. Good agreement between the calculated and measured EFGs at Cd substituting for Cu or Al atoms in CuAlO 2 indicates that the calculations were able to correctly describe the ground state of the system containing the impurity. It is shown that a specific hybridization scheme, involving Cu (and Cd) s and d z 2 orbitals and neighbouring O p z orbitals, takes place at the Cu sites in CuAlO 2 as proposed earlier. The results of the calculations indicate that the Cd-doped system changes its electrical properties when Cd replaces Cu atoms (producing an n-type semiconductor), but not when it substitutes for Al atoms.},

The first type involves application of the mixing laws for porous mineral aggregates containing various fluids. The second type is the empirical model in which other more easily-measured physical properties are related to thermal conductivity through application of regression analysis to laboratory data. The third type is the theoretical model based on the mechanisms of heat transfer applicable to simplified geometries of the rock/fluid system. The chapter also describes mixing law models, empirical models, and theoretical models. Although mixing law models have been widely used to estimate thermal conductivities of composite systems, their application to rock/fluid systems is not satisfactory for they fail to take into account the complex geometries of such systems. Empirical models are often used as an alternative and they are generally satisfactory for a given suite of rocks.},

@inproceedings{Graves2002,
abstract = {AbstractThe temperature effects of high power lasers on rock strength and mechanical properties are presented. It was found that the high temperature induced by lasers drilling through rock enhances porosity and permeability and reduces strength. High temperature causes microcracks, vaporizes cementation, and dehydrates clays.Microcracks were monitored using thin sections and SEM analyses. Representative samples were cut for thin section analyses before and after lasing. For the SEM test, a small fragment of the sample was removed and coated with gold for better electron conductivity, thus allowing fracture imaging in three dimensions.Phase changes also affect rock properties such as permeability, porosity and strength. The effect depends on the temperature distribution and gradient as well as the mineralogy. At each temperature, different reactions take place. For example, at 550{\^{A}}°C smectite clay will collapse and dehydrate. This mechanism results in increasing void space in the rock sample. At the same temperature, quartz grains will expand by 1.75{\%}1 and when the grains cool, microcracks are created, which also increases the void space. This increase in void space may or may not change permeability, but it does decrease the acoustic velocities that in turn change the calculated porosity and elastic moduli.Results show in all cases, the Young's modulus, shear modulus, bulk modulus, and combined modulus near the lased portion, were reduced when compared to the unlased portion.In sandstones, the decrease was 50{\%} or more. A bulk modulus decreased of 50{\%} causes the compressibility near the wellbore to increase by 50{\%}. Depending on the lithology, Poisson's ratio decreased or increased slightly. For limestones and shales, the differences between the moduli of lased and unlased samples were less significant than in sandstone. IntroductionReservoir rock strength and mechanical (elastic) properties have applications in many areas relating to petroleum engineering. Many of these applications, such as; compaction, borehole stability, friable sand stability, hydraulic fracture design, algorithms used in logging, compressive strength for calculating the failure envelope, and anelastic behavior models used to estimate in-situ stress, are near wellbore phenomena. Temperature induced changes to reservoir rocks are also near wellbore phenomena.Traditionally, temperature effects on rocks are considered minimal when compared to the effects of pressure and introduced fluids, such as completion fluids and drilling mud. Application of lasers for rock destruction in drilling and perforating generates a tremendous temperature which changes the rock structure and therefore, the rock strength and elastic properties.The thermal properties of rocks are very complex, as are most rock properties. They are a function of mineralogy, density, melting temperature, porosity, permeability, etc. Whether the changes in rock properties are considered positive or negative depends on the applications mentioned above. For example, high thermal conductivity results in a wide range of temperature distribution resulting in improved porosity and permeability and decreased rock strength. Weakening the rock is good for hydraulic fracturing applications. Low thermal conductivity does not allow the rock to weaken as far into the formation which is good for sand control.},

@article{Burgos2010,
abstract = {Metamaterials are materials with artificial electromagnetic properties defined by their sub-wavelength structure rather than their chemical composition. Negative-index materials (NIMs) are a special class of metamaterials characterized by an effective negative index that gives rise to such unusual wave behaviour as backwards phase propagation and negative refraction. These extraordinary properties lead to many interesting functions such as sub-diffraction imaging and invisibility cloaking. So far, NIMs have been realized through layering of resonant structures, such as split-ring resonators, and have been demonstrated at microwave to infrared frequencies over a narrow range of angles-of-incidence and polarization. However, resonant-element NIM designs suffer from the limitations of not being scalable to operate at visible frequencies because of intrinsic fabrication limitations, require multiple functional layers to achieve strong scattering and have refractive indices that are highly dependent on angle of incidence and polarization. Here we report a metamaterial composed of a single layer of coupled plasmonic coaxial waveguides that exhibits an effective refractive index of -2 in the blue spectral region with a figure-of-merit larger than 8. The resulting NIM refractive index is insensitive to both polarization and angle-of-incidence over a +/-50 degree angular range, yielding a wide-angle NIM at visible frequencies.},

On the level of the vectorial optics the problem of polarization is examined in detail. The formula obtained, describing a rotation of the plane of polarization due to the presence of the gravitational field, admits a direct geometrical interpretation. The theory is applied to the rotating body and a system of point masses. The physical results established concerning the asymptotic behavior of the electromagnetic waves are independent of the coordinate system used in the computations.},

The anisotropic changes arise from geminate recombinations of electron-hole pairs, which fail to diffuse out of the microvolume in which they were excited.

@article{Bakhtbidar2011,
abstract = {In gas and oil well completion, perforation channels must be made through the steel casing wall and cement and into the rock formation in the production zone to allow formation fluid to enter the well. This paper will present study results on using a pulsed CO2 laser to drill the perforation channels through reservoir rocks. With fiber optic cable delivery capability, a CO2 laser beam has the potential to be delivered to deep oil production zones. Effects of laser pulse parameters, beam properties, and assistant gas purging on the perforating efficiency and rock permeability will be reported. Unlike the conventional explosive charge perforation that often causes great reduction of rock permeability, laser perforation would enhance the rock permeability, therefore increasing the oil or gas production rate of the well. Laser on time, laser relaxation time between laser bursts and sample rotary speed also affect the perforation. A laser burst is the sum of the multiple pulses over the period of laser on time. Pulsed CO2 laser with fiber optic cable delivery is a strong candidate for laser perforation application for oil and natural gas wells. Preliminary test shows that CO2 laser can perforate the rock as efficiently as the other types of high power lasers and the permeability of the rock lased by pulsed CO2 laser beam increases up to 566{\%} compared to non-lased rocks due to clay dehydration and microfractures induced by the high temperature gradient and phase transformation volume expansion generated in the rock while lasing.},

abstract = {Effective thermal conductivity (ETC) of oil-saturated sandstone (porosity 13{\%}) have been measured over a temperature range from (288 to 520). K and at pressures up to 250. MPa with a steady-state parallel-plate apparatus. The expanded uncertainty of thermal conductivity, pressure, and temperature measurements at the 95{\%} confidence level with a coverage factor of k=2 were estimated to be 2{\%}, 0.05{\%}, and 30. mK, respectively. The estimated uncertainty in ETC measurement does not include the uncertainty due to contact thermal resistance and radiative conductivity. A rapid increase of ETC was found for oil-saturated sandstone at low pressures between (0.1 and 100) MPa along various isotherms. At high pressures (P{\textgreater}100. MPa) a weak linear dependence of the ETC with pressure was observed. The pressure effect is negligible small after the first 100. MPa where bridging of microcracks or improvement of grain contacts take place. The temperature, ???ln??/???TP, and pressure, ???ln??/???PT, coefficients for oil-saturated sandstone were calculated by using the measured ETC. We interpreted measured ETC data for oil-saturated sandstone using various theoretical models in order to check their accuracy, predictive capability, and applicability. We demonstrated that the combined effect of porosity, temperature, pressure, and fluid saturation can be predicted accurately using a Zimmerman's model. The effect of saturating fluids, structure (size, shape, and distribution of the pores), porosity, and mineralogical composition on temperature and pressure dependences of the ETC of oil-saturated sandstone was discussed. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The experiments are performed in a 200 keV field‐emission scanning transmission electron microscope (TEM/STEM) that provides an electron probe about 1–2 nm in diameter (FWHM) with approximately 1 nA of current. When entire films are annealed in the absence of electron irradiation, they crystallize at approximately 450 K. Crystallization occurs under focused‐probe electron irradiation when the average film temperature is as low as 300 K. The local transformation is driven by some combination of electron‐beam heating and radiation‐defect generation.

On the basis of the developed concept, an optical fiber multiplexer (OF multiplexer) for a measuring system with fiber optically guided sensors was constructed, manufactured and characterized. A mathematical model for the OF multiplexer light transfer function was calculated and an automatic adjustment developed. The average optical loss including connectors is around 1.5 dB and the maximum transmitted power is about 1 kW by use of 1000 $\mu$m fibers within a wavelength range of 250–900 nm.},

abstract = {We present the methodological framework of the Swanepoel method for the spectrophotometric determination of optical properties in thin films using transmittance data. As an illustrative case study, we determined the refractive index, thickness, absorption index, and extinction coefficient of a nanostructured 3 mol{\%} Y2O3-doped ZrO2 (yttria stabilized zirconia, 3YSZ) thin film prepared by the sol–gel method and deposited by dipping onto a soda-lime glass substrate. In addition, using the absorption index obtained with the Swanepoel method, we calculated the optical band gap of the film. The refractive index was found to increase, then decrease, and finally stabilize with increasing wavelength of the radiation, while the absorption index and extinction coefficient decreased monotonically to zero. These trends are explained in terms of the location of the absorption bands. We also deduced that this 3YSZ thin film has a direct optical band gap of 4.6 eV. All these results compared well with those given in the literature for similar thin films. This suggests that the Swanepoel method has an important role to play in the optical characterization of ceramic thin films.},

Here we report a new efficient methodology for the preparation of metal-organic open-framework magnetic structures based on the use of a persistent organic free radical (PTMTC), functionalized with three carboxylic groups. Using this approach, we create an open-framework structure which we call MOROF-1, combining very large pores (2.8-3.1 nm) with bulk magnetic ordering. MOROF-1 shows a reversible and highly selective solvent-induced 'shrinking-breathing' process involving large volume changes (25-35{\%}) that strongly influence the magnetic properties of the material. This magnetic sponge-like behaviour could be the first stage of a new route towards magnetic solvent sensors.},

In this paper, the distributions of local energy density and power dissipation in nanogratings are investigated using the rigorous coupled-wave analysis. It is demonstrated that the enhancement of absorption is accompanied by the enhancement of energy storage both for material at the resonance of its dielectric function described by the classical Lorentz oscillator and for nanostructures at the resonance induced by its geometric arrangement. The appearance of strong local electric field in nanogratings at the geometry-induced resonance is directly related to the maximum electric energy storage. Analysis of the local energy storage and dissipation can also help gain a better understanding of the global energy storage and dissipation in nanostructures for photovoltaic and heat transfer applications.},

First, using the method of physical simulation, the superiority of multi-thermal fluid is investigated from the Pressure–Volume–Temperature (PVT) performance and displacing characteristics. Thereafter, based on multi-thermal fluid injection technology and steam-assisted-gravity-drainage (SAGD) theory, a new Improved-Oil-Recovery technique for THORs, Multi-thermal Fluid Assisted Gravity Drainage (MFAGD) technique is proposed in this paper. Applying the dimensionless scaling criterion of gravity-drainage process, two 3D gravity-drainage experiments (SAGD, SAGD-to-MFAGD) are conducted. Thus, the enhanced-oil-recovery (EOR) mechanisms of multi-thermal fluid in heavy oil reservoirs are analyzed, and the thermal recovery performance of MFAGD process is discussed. Results indicate that compared with SAGD process, MFAGD process has a higher recovery rate, and it could further improve the gravity-drainage effect in THOR. Besides the conventional operation of SAGD, the EOR mechanisms of MFAGD technique also include heat insulation, energy recovery, gas dissolution and auxiliary cleanup of non-condensable gas. This method technologically supports the effective and efficient development of THORs.},

abstract = {crystals at continuous-wave illumination are reported. The investigation clearly indicates an increase in the photorefraction amplitude $\Delta$ns (at saturation) with light intensity J for all crystals studied. The main result is a correlation between ∂($\Delta$ns)/∂J and the density N of intrinsic defects such as NbLi. This effect is independent of the accidental iron contamination. Therefore at low J, $\Delta$ns decreases with an increase in N, whereas at high J the opposite dependence is observed. The threshold intensity value of such a transformation correlates with the optical quality of the crystal. It has been established that these photorefraction changes are connected with the light induced absorption of the secondary centers, caused by the existence of the metastable small polarons at room temperature during illumination.},

abstract = {The laser cleaning process combined with laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS) were applied to restore and characterize altered limestones of the ancient jamb of the historic entrance gate of Castello Svevo, Bari, Italy. This area of the masonry blocks of the limestone castle was chosen because of its evident degradation with an apparent deposit of black crusts. The combination of a Q-switched Nd:YAG pulsed laser with the diagnostics typical of the LIBS technique was shown to be very effective for monitoring, controlling and characterizing the laser cleaning process of limestone. The different elemental compositions of the black encrustations covering the stone surface and the underlying stone allowed to evaluate and avoid over-cleaning and/or under-cleaning. Further, coupling LIBS to the cleaning process provided important information about the optimal experimental conditions to be used for evaluating the conservation status and determining the most proper cleaning restoration procedure before operating the consolidation of the blocks. Thus a sufficient removal of unwanted layers could be achieved without modifying the surface underneath and ameliorating the effectiveness of traditional cleaning techniques. In this work, the elemental composition of the ablated black crust and the underlying stone were determined by the spectroscopic study of plasma emitted from either a single pulse (SP) or a double pulse (DP) LIBS configuration. With respect to SP LIBS, a marked enhancement of the signal emission was observed by DP-LIBS used after a previous stratigraphic DP-LIBS assessment of the cleaning depth.},

We used an x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) with individual 50-femtosecond-duration x-ray pulses to minimize radiation damage and obtained a high-resolution room-temperature structure of a human serotonin receptor using sub-10-micrometer microcrystals grown in a membrane mimetic matrix known as lipidic cubic phase. Compared with the structure solved by using traditional microcrystallography from cryo-cooled crystals of about two orders of magnitude larger volume, the room-temperature XFEL structure displays a distinct distribution of thermal motions and conformations of residues that likely more accurately represent the receptor structure and dynamics in a cellular environment.},

abstract = {The objective of this work is to clarify the mechanisms of additional viscosity reduction of heavy oil/bitumen using nano-size metal particles during steam injection techniques. For this purpose, three sets of experiments are designed. The objective of the first series of experiments was to study the effect of metal particles on the viscosity of the produced oil at low temperature. Viscometry experiments at temperatures below 100. ??C were conducted for this purpose. Then, their effect was studied in the presence of aqueous phase at high temperature of 300. ??C to simulate the steam stimulation processes. The third set of experiments was designed to study the effect of micro- and nano-sized metal particles on the enhancement of heat transfer within the oil phase.The experiments showed that at low temperatures, the particles reduce the heavy oil viscosity after being mixed with the oil phase. The amount of the viscosity reduction is a function of the concentration of the particles and there exists an optimum concentration of particles yielding maximum amount of viscosity reduction. Also, the trend of viscosity versus concentration of the particles is a function of the type and size of the metal, and the temperature. The second series of experiments revealed that the same trend of viscosity versus concentration of particles is observed at steam injection conditions. However, much higher degree of reduction in viscosity was observed in this case compared to the low temperature experiments. The third series of experiments showed that metal particles used at their optimum concentration do not provide significant improvement of heat transfer.The experiments provided a good understanding of the ongoing mechanisms that would lead to a viscosity reduction by the addition of metal particles. The concentration, type, and size of the particles were found to be highly critical on viscosity reduction. The optimal values of these parameters were identified. The results and observations are expected to be useful in further studies and applications as to the efficiency improvement of the thermal applications for heavy-oil/bitumen recovery. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Although negative refraction has been realized in microwave and infrared by using metamaterials and by using two-dimensional waveguide structures, creation of a bulk metamaterial showing negative refraction at visible frequency has not been successful, mainly because of the significant resonance losses and fabrication difficulties. We report bulk metamaterials made of nanowires that show such negative refraction for all incident angles in the visible region. Moreover, the negative refraction occurs far from any resonance, resulting in a low-loss and a broad-band propagation at visible frequencies. These remarkable properties can substantially affect applications such as imaging, three-dimensional light manipulation, and optical communication.},

We study the diffraction patterns produced by plane chaotic waves incident on one-dimensional chaotic point scatterers. The spacing between the scatterers and the dynamics of the incident wave are given by a logistic map or standard map. We find a sharp diffraction peak when the incident dynamics is produced by the same map as the structure of the spatial configuration. The diffraction pattern is symmetric about the incident direction only if the map dynamics is invertible. Diffraction patterns with chaotic incident waves have a large signal-to-noise ratio and are well suited for pattern identification. We discuss possible applications to the scattering of microwaves from aperiodic structures. (c) 1997 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on the system of methane and water using the SPC/TSE (TSE) and the optimised SPCE/OPLS-UA potentials to decide how the structural and dynamical properties of the methane hydrate are affected when adopting different potential energy models. Our simulations were carried out at a temperature range from 230 to 260. K and a pressure of 300. bar under NPT condition. The results that compare the two models were discussed in terms of the potential energy, hydrogen bond number, mean square displacement, diffusivity, radial distribution function and number density profile for the two models. Investigation over a timescale of 85. ns demonstrated that the methane-water interaction potential energy does have an effect on the structural and dynamical properties and consequently on the hydrate formation. For the optimised SPCE/OPLS-UA potential no methane hydrate was formed over a temperature range of 230-260. K, while for the TSE model the formation of methane hydrate was observed at 230 and 240. K. The hydrate formation is not favoured by the optimised SPCE/OPLS-UA model where the methane-water interaction potential energy becomes more attractive. However, the TSE model, the more repulsive methane-water potential, stabilizes the hydrate structure. Our results for the structural and dynamical properties are self-consistent. ?? 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Quantum emission of photons caused by sudden change of the refractive index of a medium is considered. This emission appears due to time dependence of the zeroth quantum state of the field and is a non-stationary analogue of the Casimir effect. A model-exact solution of the problem is presented. If sudden changes of the refractive index are caused by excitation of a semiconductor near to a band-to-band transition by a synchroneously pumped subpicosecond dye laser the intensity of the quantum emission is approximately 10 -9 W in the infrared. The analogy of the effect with and its difference from, the Hawking and the Unruh radiations are discussed.},

@article{Ferrell1958,
abstract = {Because of their highly collective nature it is predicted that plasma oscillations in a thin metal film should, under the proper circumstances, give off ultraviolet radiation. The plasma oscillations can be excited by fast electrons, incident normal to the film and inelastically scattered by it. Surface effects are essential, and of the special types of oscillations which can occur in a plane parallel slab of electron gas, only that involving motion normal to the slab can radiate. The yield is computed to be one photon for every one thousand electrons incident at 10 kev. The radiation is at the plasma frequency, $\omega$p, or at 2100 A for a sodium film. Its identification should be facilitated by the characteristic cos$\theta$ dependence of the intensity, where $\theta$ is the angle between the foil normal and the direction of emission of the photon. Straight-forward computation yields a radiative mean life of $\omega$p-1($\lambda$p/$\pi$$\tau$)×(cos$\theta$/sin2$\theta$), which is generally shorter than that due to intrinsic interband damping, except at small angles. $\lambda$p is the photon wavelength and $\tau$ the film thickness. From the competition of the two decay modes it should be possible to determine the intrinsic damping rate, and hence the product of the optical constants nk. The radiative lifetime is so short as to produce appreciable line-broadening, and thereby provide an independent check on the experiment. In the appendix the inelastic electron scattering coefficient is derived for the excitation in a thin film of the radiative-type plasma oscillations.},

@article{Giacco2015a,
abstract = {The unexpected weakness of some faults has been attributed to the emergence of acoustic waves that promote failure by reducing the confining pressure through a mechanism known as acoustic fluidization, also proposed to explain earthquake remote triggering. Here we validate this mechanism via the numerical investigation of a granular fault model system. We find that the stick-slip dynamics is affected only by perturbations applied at a characteristic frequency corresponding to oscillations normal to the fault, leading to gradual dynamical weakening as failure is approaching. Acoustic waves at the same frequency spontaneously emerge at the onset of failure in the absence of perturbations, supporting the relevance of acoustic fluidization in earthquake triggering.},

@article{Leonard1995,
abstract = {This study shows the connection between the morphological structure of transferred films and the chemical composition of the monolayer before transfer. The stability of a behenic acid monolayer depends on the linked influence of the type of cation and of the pH value in the aqueous subphase. The stability of the monolayer is assessed by the expansion of the solid-packed state and by the relaxation time. Its integrity is characterized by the number of crystal defects which appear in transferred Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) films as seen through Nomarski microscope observations. Both stability and integrity are greatly improved when Cd2+ or Mn2+are added to the subphase at pH 5.75 and 6 respectively. In these conditions, the transfer is very efficient and the LB films thus obtained are of very high quality. The pH values of the subphase at which the molecules of behenic acid are transformed into bivalent salts differ significantly according to the nature of the cation involved. Comparing infrared spectra of the LB films, it appeared that the relative amount of acid/salt found in the monolayer was practically the same with a subphase containing either Cd2+ at pH 5.75 or Mn2+ at pH 6. This suggests that the ratio of acidic and salt forms would be a key parameter for obtaining high-quality LB films.},

@article{Loke2014,
abstract = {The ultrahigh demand for faster computers is currently tackled by traditional methods such as size scaling (for increasing the number of devices), but this is rapidly becoming almost impossible, due to physical and lithographic limitations. To boost the speed of computers without increasing the number of logic devices, one of the most feasible solutions is to increase the number of operations performed by a device, which is largely impossible to achieve using current silicon-based logic devices. Multiple operations in phase-change-based logic devices have been achieved using crystallization; however, they can achieve mostly speeds of several hundreds of nanoseconds. A difficulty also arises from the trade-off between the speed of crystallization and long-term stability of the amorphous phase. We here instead control the process of melting through premelting disordering effects, while maintaining the superior advantage of phase-change-based logic devices over silicon-based logic devices. A melting speed of just 900 ps was achieved to perform multiple Boolean algebraic operations (e.g., NOR and NOT). Ab initio molecular-dynamics simulations and in situ electrical characterization revealed the origin (i.e., bond buckling of atoms) and kinetics (e.g., discontinuouslike behavior) of melting through premelting disordering, which were key to increasing the melting speeds. By a subtle investigation of the well-characterized phase-transition behavior, this simple method provides an elegant solution to boost significantly the speed of phase-change-based in-memory logic devices, thus paving the way for achieving computers that can perform computations approaching terahertz processing rates.},

abstract = {In this work, the two main factors that influence the repeatability of the laser percussion drilling process are identified. Experimental parametric analysis was carried out to correlate the laser parameters with the repeatability of a laser percussion drilling process. The experiment was conducted using a flash lamp pumped Nd:YAG laser to drill 2 mm thick mild steel sheets. The relationship between the percentage standard deviation (PSD) of entrance hole diameter, hole circularity and the operating parameters is established. Thirty-five holes were drilled and analysed for each set of identical laser parameters. The PSD of entrance hole diameter ranges between 1.47{\%} and 4.78{\%} for an operating window of 3.5-7 kW peak power, and 1-3 ms pulse width. The circularity of the entrance hole (defined as the ratio between the minimum and maximum diameters of the hole) ranges from 0.94 to 0.87, and is found to correlate with repeatability. The work shows that higher peak power, and shorter pulse width gives better hole geometry repeatability. The effect of melt ejection on hole geometry repeatability is also investigated. Melt ejection and spatter formation have been found to contribute to the poor repeatability of the process. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We present a new configuration of quadriwave lateral shearing interferometer dedicated to phase detection for beam-combining purposes. Assuming that the fibers are disposed in a matrix arrangement, our scheme gives direct access to the phase step between adjacent fibers in two dimensions. Experimentally recorded interferograms are made only of two-wave interference fringes that scroll as the phase evolves in the fibers. This simplicity allows fast treatment by the spatial demodulation process, and the phase map from the fibers can be estimated in real time. No external reference is required, and the technique is fully compatible with a high number of fibers.},

Emphasis is placed on data conversion between electrical and optical domains and the way limitations in each domain affect the other domain. Techniques to improve the fidelity of this conversion (both from electrical to optical domain, and vise versa) are also covered. $\backslash$nThe first few chapters cover the required theoretical background including fundamentals of fiber optics communication, fiber optics networks, converting the electrical data to light, light transmission in the medium of fiber as well as converting light back to electrical signal. A critical chapter is dedicated to characterization of optical signals. The following chapters use the theoretical background to address the design of fiber optic transceivers. The author emphasizes issues that fiber optic engineers should be familiar with, but are rarely discussed in books because they belong to an area which is neither purely electrical nor optical. The last few chapters cover issues such as standards (ITU, IEEE, FSAN, etc.), test and measurement methodologies, and reliability (over temperature performance, aging, failure rates, shock and vibration, etc.).},

The experiment made use of a CW magnetron operating at 2450 Mc with several hundred watts of power output for the power source, a 9.5 foot diameter ellipsoidal transmitting antenna, a diagonal-horn receiving antenna separated from the transmitting antenna by 25 feet, and a close-spaced thermionic diode rectifier. The overall efficiency as measured from the output of the microwave generator to the input of an electric motor attached to the output of the microwave rectifier at the receiving point was 26{\%}. Although this experiment handled a modest amount of power over a short distance, sufficient "on-the-shelf" technology now exists in each of the component areas to increase the power-handling capability and the distance over which power can be transferred by at least a thousandfold.},

The analysis of this multiple-beam waveguide shows that such a system can substantially reduce the total mirror surface compared to the corresponding number of individual lines. With the help of analytic coupling coefficients for Gaussian beam modes deduced from the coupling integrals, configurations of four mirrors are found, which give low losses due to the reconversion of spurious modes generated at the different mirrors. Optimization of the mirror surfaces as a function of system parameters is performed and expressions for the loss as a function of the number of transmission channels are deduced. The results are confirmed by diffraction calculations and laboratory scale experiments. The application to a high-power system promises a very efficient transmission with high mode purity},

New architectures can provide a significant increase in efficiency, but today most of the approaches need additional processing steps. In this context, laser processing offers a unique way to replace technological steps like photolithography that is not compatible with the requirements of the photovoltaic industry. This paper proposes to discuss the different aspects of the simulation of these new laser processes. Selective ablation of dielectrics with a nanosecond UV laser is studied to open locally antireflection and passivation coatings at the front surface of silicon solar cells in order to take electric contacts. At the same time the influence of induced localized thermal effects on phosphorous-doped silicon emitters is investigated. Modeling results are compared to experimental data, especially SIMS measurements of the phosphorous doping profile.},

We consider the problem of finding explicit Runge–Kutta methods with optimal SSP time-step restrictions, first for the case of linear autonomous ordinary differential equations and then for nonlinear or nonautonomous equations. By using alternate formulations of the associated optimization problems and introducing a new, more general class of low-storage implementations of Runge–Kutta methods, new optimal low-storage methods and new low-storage implementations of known optimal methods are found.

By the method of variable separation, we derive the general expression of electric field of TM-polarized waves in two-dimensional space with excitation of any point at any time. With this expression, the solution for a spatially and temporally distributed source can be obtained theoretically. The focusing of reflected waves in the cross section is shown when the media undergoes a sudden or continuous change. The wave propagation in time-invariant media can be considered as a special case of the media under exponential variance.},

abstract = {Collagen types I and III can be characterized at the molecular level (at the tens to hundreds of nanometers scale) using small angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). Although collagen fibril structural parameters at this length scale have shown differences between diseased and nondiseased breast tissues, a comprehensive analysis involving a multitude of features with a large ({\textgreater}50) patient cohort has not previously been investigated. Breast tissue samples were excised from 80 patients presenting with either a breast lump or reduction mammoplasty. From these, invasive carcinoma, benign tissue, and normal parenchyma were analyzed. Parameters related to collagen structure, including longitudinal (axial) and lateral (equatorial) features, polar angle features, total scattering intensity, and tissue heterogeneity effects, were extracted from the SAXS patterns and examined. The amplitude of the third-order axial peak and the total scattering intensity (amorphous scatter) showed the most separation between tissue groups and a classification model using these two parameters demonstrated an accuracy of over 95{\%} between invasive carcinoma and mammoplasty patients. Normal tissue taken from disease-free patients (mammoplasty) and normal tissue taken from patients with presence of disease showed significant differences, suggesting that SAXS may provide different diagnostic information from that of conventional histopathology.},

The physical basis for the existence of relationships between the various physical properties—for example, between the velocity of elastic waves and the thermal conductivity—is given by: (1) correlations between the properties of the individual rock components, correlations between the elastic and thermal properties of minerals and fluids, (2) correlations of the considered properties, for example, elastic and thermal rock properties, with parameters like porosity and fracturing. Such parameters act as a “connecting bridge” between the properties. Two techniques—graphic using crossplots and numeric using a mathematical formalism—are presented to solve such problems and deliver information about both porosity and mineral composition.},

@book{Deen,
abstract = {An ideal text for graduate level courses in transport phenomena for chemical engineers, Analysis of Transport Phenomena provides a unified treatment of momentum, heat, and mass transfer, emphasizing the concepts and analytical techniques that apply to all of these transport processes. The first few chapters establish the tools needed for later analyses while also covering heat and mass transfer in stationary media. The similarities among the molecular or diffusive transport mechanisms--heat conduction, diffusion of chemical species, and viscous transfer of momentum--are highlighted. Conservation equations for scalar quantites are derived first in general form, and then used to obtain the governing equations for total mass, energy, and chemical species. The scaling and order-of-magnitude concepts which are crucial in modeling are also introduced. Certain key methods for solving the differential equations in transport problems, including similarity, perturbation, and finite Fourier transform techniques, are described using conduction and diffusion problems as examples. Following chapters are devoted to fluid mechanics, beginning with fundamental equations for momentum transfer and then discussing unidirectional flow, nearly unidirectional (lubrication) flow, creeping flow, and laminar boundary layer flow. Forced-convection heat and mass transfer in laminar flow, multicomponent energy and mass transfer, free convection, and turbulence are also covered. The appendix summarizes vector and tensor operations and relations involving various coordinate systems. Based on twenty years of teaching and extensive class testing, Analysis of Transport Phenomena offers students both extensive coverage of the topic and inclusion of modern examples from bioengineering, membrane science, and materials processing. It is mathematically self-contained and is also unique in its treatment of scaling and approximation techniques and its presentation of the finite Fourier transform method for solving partial differential equations.},

abstract = {In the decade since the publication of the second edition of Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-Ray Microanalysis, there has been a great expansion in the capabilities of the basic scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the x-ray spectrometers. The emergence of the variab- pressure/environmental SEM has enabled the observation of samples c- taining water or other liquids or vapor and has allowed for an entirely new class of dynamic experiments, that of direct observation of che- cal reactions in situ. Critical advances in electron detector technology and computer-aided analysis have enabled structural (crystallographic) analysis of specimens at the micrometer scale through electron backscatter diffr- tion (EBSD). Low-voltage operation below 5 kV has improved x-ray spatial resolution by more than an order of magnitude and provided an effective route to minimizing sample charging. High-resolution imaging has cont- ued to develop with a more thorough understanding of how secondary el- trons are generated. The ?eld emission gun SEM, with its high brightness, advanced electron optics, which minimizes lens aberrations to yield an - fective nanometer-scale beam, and “through-the-lens” detector to enhance the measurement of primary-beam-excited secondary electrons, has made high-resolution imaging the rule rather than the exception. Methods of x-ray analysis have evolved allowing for better measurement of specimens with complex morphology: multiple thin layers of different compositions, and rough specimens and particles. Digital mapping has transformed classic x-ray area scanning, a purely qualitative technique, into fully quantitative compositional mapping.},

abstract = {The possibility of second-harmonic generation based on surface dipole and bulk multipole nonlinearities in silica nanowires is investigated numerically. Both circular and microstructured nanowires are considered. Phase matching is provided by propagating the pump field in the fundamental mode, while generating the second harmonic in one of the modes of the LP11 multiplet. This is shown to work in both circular and microstructured nanowires, although only one of the LP11 modes can be phase-matched in the microstructure. The prospect of obtaining large conversion efficiencies in silica-based nanowires is critically discussed, based on simulations of second-harmonic generation in nanowires with a fluctuating phase-matching wavelength. It is concluded that efficient wavelength conversion will require strong improvements in the nanowire uniformity, peak powers well in excess of 10 KW, increase of the second-order nonlinearity by an order of magnitude by use of a different base material, or highly polarizable surface coatings.},

Emphasis is placed on the excitation problem and on source-dependent phenomena which are not evident when attention is given only to the source-free case. After a presentation and interpretation of various exact closed-form solutions for simple nondispersive and dispersive media undergoing sudden or gradual temporal changes, attention is given to integral representations required under more general conditions. In the ensuing far-zone asymptotic analysis, dispersion surfaces and space-time rays are used extensively for identification of wave packets and other wave constituents descriptive of the field, and a comparison is made between the asymptotic results and the exact solutions noted above. Asymptotic field solutions are then derived by a direct ray procedure, without intervention of integral representations. The examples considered exhibit a variety of phenomena, among which the most interesting is the focusing of reflected waves when a dispersive medium undergoes a sudden change.},

In this paper, a conversion coating on carbon steel with good anti-wax performance was constructed to solve this problem through a simple coating and heat treatment process. The conversion coating is composed of pyrophosphate with a flower-like microstructure. After wax deposition test, the conversion coating has low wax deposition weight which is 2.9mg/cm2 and high wax deposition reduction rate (80{\%} in average). The conversion coating has a special wettability which is superoleophobic with low oil-adhesion in water (oil contact angle is 162° and rolling angle is 7°) and hydrophilic in oil.

abstract = {A new polymer named polyferrocarbosilane(PFCS) was prepared from polydimethylsilane and ferrocene. The spinnability of this polymer can be tailored by controlling the content of ferrocene in the polymer. The prepared polymer was spun into a continuous polymer fiber that was subsequently cured in air and heat-treated finally in N2 up to 1350 ??C for conversion into Si-Fe-C-O fibers. The resulted Si-Fe-C-O fibers display low specific resistance and magnetic property due to the existence of Fe, which also reduces the specific resistance significantly to 10-2 ??cm at room temperature when the amount of ferrocene in feed is as low as 3.0{\%} (mass fraction). The resulted Si-Fe-C-O fibers, with C/Si molar ratio of about 1.3 and the maximum Fe content of about 2.0{\%} (mole fraction), are composed of ??-SiC and small amount of Fe3Si-like crystalline and have an average tensile strength of about 2.0 GPa. ?? 2007 The Nonferrous Metals Society of China.},

Recent developments in high power fiber lasers offer technical advantages when compared to other industrial lasers that may now allow economic subsurface applications to rock formations, delivering the beam through optical fiber from the surface via the wellbore. Successful applications in this manner would provide an alternative to conventional methods that employ rotary drilling and shaped charge explosives. Various parameters affecting laser penetration into samples of sandstone and limestone were studied and optimized. A maximum penetration depth of 30 cm for 8.9-mm hole diameter was achieved in limestone, while 15 cm penetration depth was achieved in sandstone with the same hole diameter. In all cases, the hole diameter was no greater than the beam diameter applied},

The paper studies interaction mechanisms both from phenomenological and fundamental viewpoints. Relaxation, resonance, interface phenomena, plasmons, the concepts of permittivity and permeability, and relaxation times are summarized. Topics of current research interest, such as negative-index behavior, noise, plasmonic behavior, RF heating, nanoscale materials, wave cloaking, polaritonic surface waves, biomaterials, and other topics are overviewed. Relaxation, resonance, and related relaxation times are overviewed. The wavelength and material length scales required to define permittivity in materials is discussed.},

Numerical simulations of these devices are an important tool, which enables an improved understanding of ICP processes. Simulations based on fluid models have been reported in literature numerous times; however, in most cases high accuracies require expensive computational costs. We have checked in this work the applicability of COMSOL for plasma simulations, using a fluid model able to provide high accuracies with very low computational cost. A Boltzmann equation solver has been included in order to calculate the electron energy distribution function and the reduced electron mobility. Ions mobility has been calculated as a function of the reduced electric field. The results of the simulations have been benchmarked both against model and experimental results showing a high correlation with experimental values. This model approach can provide, in addition to high accuracy, fast simulations with an easy set-up of initial conditions, which allows flexible changes in the input variables in a short period of time.},

Charge storage and charge spreading in these glasses have been examined with help of a time resolved current method. Our interest concerns more particularly the dynamic behavior and the amount of the space charge build-up during and after electron irradiation under different experimental conditions of primary beam energy and current density. The precise contributions of different possible self regulation processes (leakage current and secondary electron emission) for charge accumulation are analyzed. Moreover, to characterize the ability of glasses to store charges in a stable way we introduce a relevant parameter that expresses quantitatively the variation in the released charge. The primary beam energy and the current density effects on the evolution of secondary electron emission yield during irradiation are also examined. As expected, the charge storage and spreading processes appear to be extremely dependent on the incident beam energy, current density and on the chemical composition of the studied glasses.},

abstract = {Amorphous arsenic sulphide ͑As2S3͒ films prepared by ultrafast pulsed laser deposition have been vacuum annealed at a range of different temperatures. Measurements of the glass transition temperature indicate that a crystallization process initiates at annealing temperatures around 170 ° C. In combination with Raman scattering analysis, we conclude that phase separation is intrinsic for our as-deposited films. During annealing two sorts of phase transformation are identified: one between different amorphous polymorphs, and another from the amorphous to a crystalline state. We point out a correlation between these two types of transformation and two characteristic time scales identified from measurements of the relaxation of the refractive index, and explain the Arrhenius and non-Arrhenius behaviors leading to the observed temporal characteristics},

The first of these is to use well log data directly and correlate these data with measured values of thermal conductivity or use interpreted well log data and apply these data to previously established correlations. The second approach is to derive thermal properties data from temperature gradient surveys in boreholes. Temperature surveys in wells are useful in estimating thermal conductivities of the surrounding formations. Transient thermal gradients show some promise of yielding information from which thermal conductivities may be estimated. The large amount of heat available and transferred by the flowing fluid overwhelms heat transfer by conduction. The chapter suggests that it is particularly important to insulate steam injection or geothermal producing wells opposite shallow or low pressure formations to avoid this excessive heat loss.},

The spatial discretization, like that of the well-known Clawpack software, is based on solving Riemann problems and calculating fluctuations (not fluxes). The implementation employs weighted essentially nonoscillatory reconstruction in space and strong stability preserving Runge--Kutta integration in time. The method can be extended to arbitrarily high order of accuracy and allows a well-balanced implementation for capturing solutions of balance laws near steady state. This well-balancing is achieved through the {\$}f{\$}-wave Riemann solver and a novel wave-slope WENO reconstruction procedure. The wide applicability and advantageous properties of the method are demonstrated through numerical examples, including problems in nonconservative form, problems with spatially varying fluxes, and problems involving near-equilibrium solutions of balance laws.},

Optical damage is important because it limits the maximum amount of power that can be transmitted through a particular optical material. This damage imposes a constraint on the efficiency of many nonlinear optical processes by limiting the maximum field strength that can be used to excite the nonlinear response without occurrence of optical damage. This chapter presents a detailed description of several mechanisms related to optical damage including linear absorption, Avalanche breakdown, multiphoton ionization or multiphoton dissociation of the optical material, and direct (single cycle) field ionization. The chapter summarizes some of the basic empirical observations regarding optical damage. The multiphoton absorption process which constitutes a nonlinear loss mechanism that can limit the efficiency of nonlinear optical devices such as optical switches is also discussed. A calculation of the rate at which multiphoton absorption processes occur is also carried out. The theory of single- and multiphoton absorption and Fermi's golden rule are also presented in the chapter.},

It is observed that the nano-nickel can catalyze the aqua-thermolysis reaction of extra-heavy oil at 280 ??C. The experimental results demonstrate that compared with the original crude oil sample, the mean molecular weight of the upgraded sample decreases, the content of sulfur changes from 0.45{\%} to 0.23{\%}, the content of resin and asphaltene reduces 15.83{\%} and 15.33{\%}, respectively. Based on the GC-MS analysis results, a reaction pathway is proposed that involves hydrogen transfer from methylcyclohexane to the extra-heavy crude oil resulting in the formation of toluene. During the cooling process after upgrading reaction, the W/O emulsion is formed in the presence of the surfactant AEO9. As a result, with respect to the original crude oil, the viscosity of upgraded sample is changed from 139800 mPa??s to 2400 mPa??s at 50 ??C, an approximately 98.90{\%} reduction by the synergetic effects of upgrading, emulsification and diluting. ?? 2007 Institute of Coal Chemistry, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

@article{Ramm1994,
abstract = {Empirical porosity/depth trends from the Norwegian Continental Shelf are discussed in the light of models on compactional processes during burial. Linear best-fit lines are useful as a first approximation, illustrating the general decline in porosity with depth. Porosity increases non-linearly with pore-pressure, and notably higher than normal porosity is found in very high overpressure reservoirs. Hydrostatic pressure sandstones from the Haltenbanken area are on average more porous than equivalents from the northern Viking Graben. This may be related to the burial history, as generally more subsidence occurred in Late Pliocene and Pleistocene in the Haltenbanken basins. The porosity/depth data show considerable scatter, and this is to a large degree related to the initial mineralogical composition. Correlated with mineralogical analyses, the reservoir sandstones show a trend towards lower porosity with increasing clay content at shallow burial, probably due to more extensive mechanical compaction. At depths {\textgreater}3.0- 3.5 km, the porosity loss is highest in sandstones with low clay contents. This may be explained by a lower rate of quartz cementation in sandstones with abundant intergranular clays or clay coatings around quartz grains. These data show that pre-burial mineralogy is a very important factor in porosity prediction of sandstones, in many cases more important than the degree of overpressure.},

With a graphene sample as the saturable absorber, a pulsed optical vortex was achieved at a wavelength of 1.36 $\mu$m, which identified that graphene could be used as a pulse modulator for the generation of a pulsed optical vortex. Thermally driven cw and pulsed optical vortexes should have various promising applications based on the compact structure, changeable topological charges, and specific wavelength.},

abstract = {Acoustic isolation and nonreciprocal sound transmission are highly desirable in many practical scenarios. They may be realized with nonlinear or magneto-acoustic effects, but only at the price of high power levels and impractically large volumes. In contrast, nonreciprocal electromagnetic propagation is commonly achieved based on the Zeeman effect, or modal splitting in ferromagnetic atoms induced by a magnetic bias. Here, we introduce the acoustic analog of this phenomenon in a subwavelength meta-atom consisting of a resonant ring cavity biased by a circulating fluid. The resulting angular momentum bias splits the ring's azimuthal resonant modes, producing giant acoustic nonreciprocity in a compact device. We applied this concept to build a linear, magnetic-free circulator for airborne sound waves, observing up to 40-decibel nonreciprocal isolation at audible frequencies.},

abstract = {Dielectric properties of materials are crucial in describing the electromagnetic response of materials. As devices are becoming considerably smaller than the optical wavelength, the conventional measuring methods based on optical response are limited by their spatial resolution. Electron energy loss spectroscopy performed in a scanning transmission electron microscope is a good alternative to obtain the dielectric properties with excellent spatial resolution. Due to the overlap of diffraction discs in scanning transmission electron microscopy, it is difficult to apply conventional experimental settings to suppress retardation losses. In this contribution, a relativistic dielectric model for the loss function is presented which is used in a model based optimization scheme to estimate the complex dielectric function of a material. The method is applied to experiments on bulk diamond and SrTiO3 and shows a good agreement with optical reference data when retardation effects are included. Application of this technique to nanoparticles is possible but several theoretical assumptions made in the model of the loss function are violated and interpretation becomes problematic.},

abstract = {The well-known contact-free, laser-flash method was used for measurement of the thermal diffusivity (a) of natural sandstone samples. The experimental procedure was conducted using the microflash apparatus (LFA 457). The measurements have been made over the temperature range from (302.9 to 774.3) K. The isobaric heat capacities (CP) of the same sample were measured over the temperature range from (308 to 763) K using DSC 204 F1. Uncertainties are 3 {\%} and 1 {\%} for a and CP, respectively. Measured values of a and CP together with density data were used to calculate the thermal conductivity $\lambda$ of sandstone. Theoretically based correlations for the thermal diffusivity (damped harmonic oscillator, DHO) and heat capacity (Debye and Einstein theories) were adopted to accurately represent the measured data. Correlation equations for the thermal diffusivity and heat capacity have been developed using the well-known theoretical asymptotic behavior of a(T) and CP for various temperature ranges (low- and high-temperature limits). The microscopic nature of the effect of temperature on a(T) and $\lambda$(T) behavior of sandstone is discussed. Detailed interpretation and testing of the measured property data for sandstone using various existing theoretical and empirical models, in order to check their accuracy, predictive capability, and applicability, are provided.},

Photonic-based microwave-wave sources now provide record, close-to-carrier phase-noise performance, and compact sources using microcavities are available commercially. Photonics-based solutions address a challenging scaling problem in electronics, increasing attenuation with frequency. A second scaling challenge, however, is to maintain low phase noise in reduced form factor and even integrated systems. On this second front, there has been remarkable progress in the area of microcavity devices with large storage time (high optical quality factor). Here we report generation of highly coherent microwaves using a chip-based device that derives stability from high optical quality factor. The device has a record low electronic white-phase-noise floor for a microcavity-based oscillator and is used as the optical, voltage-controlled oscillator in the first demonstration of a photonic-based, microwave frequency synthesizer. The synthesizer performance is comparable to mid-range commercial devices.},

abstract = {It is possible to construct artificial spacetime geometries for light by using intense laser pulses that modify the spatiotemporal properties of an optical medium. Here we theoretically investigate experimental possibilities for studying spacetime metrics of the form {\$}\backslashtextrm{\{}d{\}}s{\^{}}2=c{\^{}}2\backslashtextrm{\{}d{\}}t{\^{}}2-\backslasheta(t){\^{}}2\backslashtextrm{\{}d{\}}x{\^{}}2{\$}. By tailoring the laser pulse shape and medium properties, it is possible to create a refractive index variation {\$}n=n(t){\$} that can be identified with {\$}\backslasheta(t){\$}. Starting from a perturbative solution to a generalised Hopfield model for the medium described by an {\$}n=n(t){\$} we provide estimates for the number of photons generated by the time-dependent spacetime. The simplest example is that of a uniformly varying {\$}\backslasheta(t){\$} that therefore describes the Robertson-Walker metric, i.e. a cosmological expansion. The number of photon pairs generated in experimentally feasible conditions appears to be extremely small. However, large photon production can be obtained by periodically modulating the medium and thus resorting to a resonant enhancement similar to that observed in the dynamical Casimir effect. Curiously, the spacetime metric in this case closely resembles that of a gravitational wave. Motivated by this analogy we show that a periodic gravitational wave can indeed act as an amplifier for photons. The emission for an actual gravitational wave will be very weak but should be readily observable in the laboratory analogue.},

@article{Leitz2011a,
abstract = {In the last years, laser beam drilling became in- creasingly important for many technical applications as it allows the contactless production of high quality drill holes. So far, mainly short laser pulses are of industrial relevance, as they offer a good compromise between precision and ef- ficiency and combine high ablation efficiency with low ther- mal damage of the workpiece. Laser beam drilling in this pulse length range is still a highly thermal process. There are two ablation mechanisms: evaporation and melt expulsion. In order to achieve high quality processing results, a basic process understanding is absolutely necessary. Yet, process observations in laser beam drilling suffer from both the short time scales and the restricted accessibility of the interaction zone. Numerical simulations offer the possibility to acquire additional knowledge of the process as they allow a direct look into the drill hole during the ablation process. In this contribution, a numerical finite volume multi-phase simu- lation model for laser beam drilling with short laser pulses shall be presented. The model is applied for a basic study of the ablation process with µs and ns laser pulses. The ob- tained results show good qualitative correspondence with experimental data.},

abstract = {An invisibility device should guide light around an object as if nothing were there, regardless of where the light comes from. Ideal invisibility devices are impossible, owing to the wave nature of light. This study develops a general recipe for the design of media that create perfect invisibility within the accuracy of geometrical optics. The imperfections of invisibility can be made arbitrarily small to hide objects that are much larger than the wavelength. With the use of modern metamaterials, practical demonstrations of such devices may be possible. The method developed here can also be applied to escape detection by other electromagnetic waves or sound.},

The symmetry between the coordinates x=(x(1),x(2),x(3)) and the momenta p=(p(1),p(2),p(3)) in the Hamiltonian formulation of Geometrical Optics establishes a dual Hamilton-Jacobi equation for "wavefronts" in the momentum space. This equation is also an eikonal equation when the refractive index distribution has spherical symmetry. In this case, another spherical symmetric refractive index distribution may exist such that the ray trajectories in the coordinates and momentum space are exchanged (examples of this case are given: Maxwell fish-eye, Eaton lens and Luneburg lens). The relationship between the wavefronts in the coordinate and momentum space is also analyzed. Curved orthogonal coordinates are considered as well.},

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

The output power of dual-single-frequency fiber amplifiers in all-fiber configuration is boosted to 275 W with seeds central wavelength of 1063.7 and 1064.4 nm, respectively. The power conversion efficiency is 76.6{\%}. The maximum output power is limited by the pump power and no significant SBS has been detected even at the highest output power. The effect of the delivery fiber length, the optical output spectra and polarization of the amplified laser are also studied experimentally. The relative magnitude of the two single-frequency signals is maintained in the amplification process and the maximal output power of dual-single-frequency amplifiers can be increased by a factor of more than 2 compared with single-frequency amplification.},

abstract = {Thermal modeling down to great depth, e.g. down to the Mohorovicic discontinuity, requires representative values of thermal conductivity and thermal capacity at an appropriate depth. Often there is a lack of data, especially concerning temperature and pressure dependence of thermal conductivity and thermal capacity, due to missing or questionable data from boreholes. Studies of the temperature and pressure dependence of thermal conductivity and thermal capacity showed that temperature is dominating. Thus measurements on a set of magmatic, metamorphic and sedimentary rocks sampled from different depth levels of the Eastern Alpine crust were used to obtain an estimate of the temperature dependence of both properties––at least for the area of investi- gation––and to give a review of the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity (k), thermal capacity (q {\^{A}} cp ) and thermal diffusivity (j) for different types of rock. The temperature dependence of thermal conductivity for crystalline (magmatitic and metamorphic) rocks is different to that of sedimentary rocks. Using the approach that the thermal resistivity (1=k) is a linear function of temperature whose slope increases with kð0Þ, the conductivity at a temperature of 0 °C, two general equations were determined. The equation for crystalline rocks was verified in the temperature range of 0–500 °C and the equation for sedimentary rocks was tested in the temperature range from 0 to 300 °C. A general equation for the temperature dependence of k for Eastern Alpine rocks can thus be formulated: kðT Þ 1⁄4 kð0Þ 0:99 þ T ða {\`{A}} b=kð0ÞÞ with empirical constants and corresponding uncertainties a 1⁄4 0:0030 {\AE} 0:0015 and b 1⁄4 0:0042 {\AE} 0:0006 for crystalline rocks. The constants for corresponding sedimentary rocks are a 1⁄4 0:0034 {\AE} 0:0006 and b 1⁄4 0:0039 {\AE} 0:0014. k is given in W m{\`{A}}1 K{\`{A}}1 , T in °C. At ambient conditions thermal diffusivity (j) and thermal conductivity (k) for Eastern Alpine crystalline rocks show the rela- tionship: j 1⁄4 0:45 {\^{A}} k:},

abstract = {City of Light tells the story of fiber optics, tracing its transformation from 19th-century parlor trick into the foundation of our global communications network. Written for a broad audience by a journalist who has covered the field for twenty years, the book is a lively account of both the people and the ideas behind this revolutionary technology.  The basic concept underlying fiber optics was first explored in the 1840s when researchers used jets of water to guide light in laboratory demonstrations. The idea caught the public eye decades later when it was used to create stunning illuminated fountains at many of the great Victorian exhibitions. The modern version of fiber optics--using flexible glass fibers to transmit light--was discovered independently five times through the first half of the century, and one of its first key applications was the endoscope, which for the first time allowed physicians to look inside the body without surgery. Endoscopes became practical in 1956 when a college undergraduate discovered how to make solid glass fibers with a glass cladding.  With the invention of the laser, researchers grew interested in optical communications. While Bell Labs and others tried to send laser beams through the atmosphere or hollow light pipes, a small group at Standard Telecommunication Laboratories looked at guiding light by transparent fibers. Led by the recipient of the 2009 Nobel Prize in Physics, Charles K. Kao, they proposed the idea of fiber-optic communications and demonstrated that contrary to what many researchers thought glass could be made clear enough to transmit light over great distances. Following these ideas, Corning Glass Works developed the first low-loss glass fibers in 1970.  From this point fiber-optic communications developed rapidly. The first experimental phone links were tested on live telephone traffic in 1977 and within half a dozen years long-distance companies were laying fiber cables for their national backbone systems. In 1988, the first transatlantic fiber-optic cable connected Europe with North America, and now fiber optics are the key element in global communications.  The story continues today as fiber optics spread through the communication grid that connects homes and offices, creating huge information pipelines and replacing copper wires. The book concludes with a look at some of the exciting potential developments of this technology.},

abstract = {The most widely used method of thermal oil recovery is by injecting steam into the reservoir. A well-designed steam injection project is very efficient in recovering oil, however its applicability is limited in many situations. Simulation studies and field experience has shown that low injectivity reservoirs and small thickness of the oil-bearing zone limit the performance of steam injection. This paper discusses alternative methods of transferring heat to heavy oil reservoirs, based on electromagnetic energy. We present a detailed analysis of low frequency electric resistive (ohmic) heating and higher frequency electromagnetic heating (microwave frequency). We show the applicability of electromagnetic heating in two example reservoirs. The first reservoir has thin sand zones separated by impermeable shale layers and viscous oil (9541 cp at initial reservoir conditions). We model preheating the reservoir with low frequency current using two horizontal electrodes, before injecting steam. The second reservoir has low permeability and oil viscosity of 33 cp at initial reservoir conditions. In this case we use a high frequency microwave antenna located 30 ft from the producing well as the heat source. Simulation results presented in this paper suggest that electromagnetic heating may be a good stimulation technique for heavy oil reservoirs with low injectivity or with thin payzones. We identify the parameters which are critical for electromagnetic heating. We also discuss past field applications of electromagnetic heating as well as technical challenges and limitations.},

abstract = {The ongoing depletion of light oil resources and the increasing global energy demand is driving oil{\&}gas companies towards the exploitation of unconventional oil resources. In order to extract crude oil from these resources, a sufficiently low oil viscosity must be achieved, for instance through temperature increase. Electromagnetic irradiation through downhole antennae can be a suitable method for in situ heating of reservoirs. Potential problems for this technique are the extremely high temperatures that can be reached at the well containing the radiating element and the strong dependence of temperature profiles on local variation of reservoir material properties. These problems can be solved to a large extent by inserting around the radiating well a tight shell made of a low loss dielectric material, and by selecting the proper irradiation frequency.The experimental work described in this paper aims to verify the effectiveness of a similar structure during the electromagnetic heating of over 2000. kg of oil sand in a sandbox up to 200. °C, using a dipolar antenna. Oil sand was irradiated at 2.45. GHz frequency with variable power (1-2. kW). The temperature in the oil sand mass and on the boundary were recorded throughout the test in several specific points, in order to estimate temperature profiles along the distance from the antenna.Experimental results confirmed that the presence of the low lossy material shell realized around the antenna is extremely efficient in lowering the temperature in this critical zone and in better distributing the irradiated energy in the oil sand mass. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

Chalcogenide glass fiber is one of the most promising candidates for use as a non-linear optical medium because of its high optical nonlinearity and long interaction length. Since the chalcogenide glass fibers transmit into the IR, there are numerous potential applications in the civil, medical and military areas. One of the most exciting developments in the future is going to be in the area of rare-earth ion doping of chalcogenide fibers for IR fluorescence emission. The IR light sources, lasers and amplifiers developed using this phenomena will be very useful in civil, medical and military applications. Remote IR spectroscopy and imaging using flexible fibers will be realized for applications. Other future research areas which will inevitably be explored includes non-linear optical properties of these IR glasses. High-speed optical communication requires ultra-fast all-optical processing and switching capabilities.

The results allow the attribution of the polarized bands observed in both absorption and photoluminescence emission spectra. In particular, the spectral line shape and polarization of the emission are found to depend on the sample thickness, and the effect is attributed to the modification of the state of polarization of the emitted light during its propagation inside the crystal. Indeed, the directions of polarization of the lowest optical transitions and the directions of the principal axes of the dielectric tensor are demonstrated not to coincide, in contrast to the assumptions typically made in the literature, thus causing the mixed transverse/longitudinal character of light propagation.},

abstract = {Abstract Enhanced Oil Recovery techniques are gaining more attention worldwide as the proved oil reserves are declining and the oil price is hiking. Although many giant oil reservoirs in the world were already screened for EOR processes, the main challenges such as low sweep efficiency, costly techniques, possible formation damages, transportation of huge amounts of EOR agents to the fields especially for offshore cases, analyzing micro-scale multi-phase flow in the rock to the large scale tests and the lack of analyzing tools in traditional experimental works, hinder the proposed EOR processes. Our past experiences on using nanotechnology to the upstream cases, especially EOR processes, revealed solutions to some of the challenges associated with old EOR techniques. This method that utilizes particles in the order of 1 to100nm brings specific thermal, optical, electrical, rheological and interfacial properties which are directly useful to release the trapped oil from the pore spaces in the order of 5 to 50 microns of tight oil formations. Laboratory tests using nanoparticles as the EOR agent, developing nano computational models to explore the surface properties and utilizing nano-scale analyzing tools such as atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) mostly for nanoparticles distribution in the pore spaces and on the surfaces for wettability alteration studies are the main parts of this investigation},

abstract = {The doping level dependence of thermoelectric properties of delafossite CuAlO2 has been investigated in the constant scattering time (tau) approximation, starting from the first principles of electronic structure. In particular, the lattice parameters and the energy band structure were calculated using the total energy plane-wave pseudopotential method. It was found that the lattice parameters of CuAlO2 are a = 2.802 and c = 16.704 , and the internal parameter is u = 0.1097. CuAlO2 has an indirect band gap of 2.17 eV and a direct gap of 3.31 eV. The calculated energy band structures were then used to calculate the electrical transport coefficients of CuAlO2. By considering the effects of doping level and temperature, it was found that the Seebeck coefficient S(T) increases with increasing acceptor doping (A (d)) level. The values of S(T) in our experiments correspond to an A (d) level at 0.262 eV, which is identified as the Fermi level of CuAlO2. Based on our experimental Seebeck coefficient and the electrical conductivity, the constant relaxation time is estimated to be 1 x 10(-16) s. The power factor is large for a low A (d) level and increases with temperature. It is suggested that delafossite CuAlO2 can be considered as a promising thermoelectric oxide material at high doping and high temperature.},

We used an x-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) with individual 50-femtosecond-duration x-ray pulses to minimize radiation damage and obtained a high-resolution room-temperature structure of a human serotonin receptor using sub-10-micrometer microcrystals grown in a membrane mimetic matrix known as lipidic cubic phase. Compared with the structure solved by using traditional microcrystallography from cryo-cooled crystals of about two orders of magnitude larger volume, the room-temperature XFEL structure displays a distinct distribution of thermal motions and conformations of residues that likely more accurately represent the receptor structure and dynamics in a cellular environment.},

abstract = {The objective of this work is to clarify the mechanisms of additional viscosity reduction of heavy oil/bitumen using nano-size metal particles during steam injection techniques. For this purpose, three sets of experiments are designed. The objective of the first series of experiments was to study the effect of metal particles on the viscosity of the produced oil at low temperature. Viscometry experiments at temperatures below 100. ??C were conducted for this purpose. Then, their effect was studied in the presence of aqueous phase at high temperature of 300. ??C to simulate the steam stimulation processes. The third set of experiments was designed to study the effect of micro- and nano-sized metal particles on the enhancement of heat transfer within the oil phase.The experiments showed that at low temperatures, the particles reduce the heavy oil viscosity after being mixed with the oil phase. The amount of the viscosity reduction is a function of the concentration of the particles and there exists an optimum concentration of particles yielding maximum amount of viscosity reduction. Also, the trend of viscosity versus concentration of the particles is a function of the type and size of the metal, and the temperature. The second series of experiments revealed that the same trend of viscosity versus concentration of particles is observed at steam injection conditions. However, much higher degree of reduction in viscosity was observed in this case compared to the low temperature experiments. The third series of experiments showed that metal particles used at their optimum concentration do not provide significant improvement of heat transfer.The experiments provided a good understanding of the ongoing mechanisms that would lead to a viscosity reduction by the addition of metal particles. The concentration, type, and size of the particles were found to be highly critical on viscosity reduction. The optimal values of these parameters were identified. The results and observations are expected to be useful in further studies and applications as to the efficiency improvement of the thermal applications for heavy-oil/bitumen recovery. ?? 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

@inproceedings{Shah2009,
abstract = {ABSTRACT Heavy oil is an immense oil resource that is untapped because its highly viscous nature makes it difficult to produce. Currently, the heavy oil reservoir production challenges are addressed by thermal recovery techniques, CHOPS, chemical injection and miscible gas injection. In this work, the advantages of three different processes viz thermal, chemical and miscible gas injection have been merged together to come up with a novel viscosity reducing process for heavy oil. Metal Nanoparticles are used for thermal conductivity enhancement of super critical-CO2 (sc-CO2) or {\"{i}}¿½{\AA}“Viscosity reducing Injectant 0xE2 0x80 ? (VRI) for reducing the viscosity of heavy oil rapidly as compared to conventional sc-CO2 or VRI. A sc-CO2soluble surfactant has also been added to the mixture to further enhance the viscosity reduction. Thus the thermal properties of metal nanoparticles, the chemical properties of surfactant and the miscible properties of sc-CO2 and VRI altogether reduce the viscosity of heavy oil. INTRODUCTION Crude oil is considered {\"{i}}¿½{\AA}“heavy 0xE2 0x80 ? if its API gravity is lower than 20 degrees. Heavy oil is asphaltic, dense, and viscous oil that is chemically characterized by its content of asphaltenes. In spite of an immense resource base, heavy oil and natural bitumen accounted for only about 3 billion barrels of the 25 billion barrels of crude oil produced in 2000 (U.S.G.S Fact Sheet 70-03, August 2003). Currently, producers target heavy oil accumulations having better quality oil in terms of chemistry and density. About 66 percent of the heavy oil produced annually is lighter than 15{\^{A}}° API gravity, but about 50 percent of the estimated technically recoverable heavy oil is denser (less than 15{\^{A}}° API gravity, see Figure 1). In conventional production, reservoir pressure from gas and water associated with the oil is generally sufficient to cause light oil to flow to a production well. However, to sustain commercial well production rates, heavy and extra-heavy oil production almost always requires measures to reduce oil viscosity and to introduce energy into the reservoir. When super-heated steam is injected into a reservoir, oil viscosity is reduced and reservoir pressure is increased through displacement and partial distillation of the oil. Steam may be injected continuously to form a flood or it may be injected in cycles so wells are used alternately for injection and production. EOR, using miscible gas displacement, is a widely used technique and can increase the production of oil beyond what is typically achievable using the conventional recovery methods. Gas injectants are generally injected into the reservoirs either in immiscible or miscible condition. Miscible gas injection, where the gas becomes miscible with the reservoir fluid at reservoir temperature, is amongst the most widely used EOR process in the US today after thermal recovery processes, and it accounts for significant EOR oil production.

abstract = {We report on first-principles band-structure calculations of the semiconducting CuAlO 2 delafossite compound in the pure form and also with Cd impurity occupying either a Cu or Al position. The computational tool was a full-potential linear augmented plane-wave method, with the generalized gradient approximation accounting for the exchange and correlation effects. The changes caused by the presence of Cd are studied by the analysis of the electronic structure and the electric field gradient (EFG) in both Cd-doped and pure CuAlO 2 systems. Good agreement between the calculated and measured EFGs at Cd substituting for Cu or Al atoms in CuAlO 2 indicates that the calculations were able to correctly describe the ground state of the system containing the impurity. It is shown that a specific hybridization scheme, involving Cu (and Cd) s and d z 2 orbitals and neighbouring O p z orbitals, takes place at the Cu sites in CuAlO 2 as proposed earlier. The results of the calculations indicate that the Cd-doped system changes its electrical properties when Cd replaces Cu atoms (producing an n-type semiconductor), but not when it substitutes for Al atoms.},

@article{Okassa2010,
abstract = {Production from heavy oil reservoirs has always been a challenge due mainly to one factor in particular high oil viscosity, implying low oil mobility within porous media. Different methods have been implemented over the years in order to reduce oil viscosity. Well-known methods include steam injection (e.g., Steam Drive, Steam Assisted Gravity- SAGD), CO2 injection, chemical injection etc. These types of application are mainly applied to onshore fields where space is available and operating costs are much lower with respect to offshore fields. Moreover they may not be feasible for shallow reservoirs where injection could be an issue due to uncertainties regarding the cap-rock sealing. The scope of this paper is to present a patented non- conventional EOR method for heavy oil reservoirs using radio frequency/microwave heating. An adequate completion design and well-reservoir connection is used for heating the oil, thus solving the problems that impede RadioFrequency /MicroWave (RF/MW) penetration into the reservoir. Consequently, oil viscosity may be reduced, thus allowing its continuous production to surface (eventually by means of an artificial lift system included in the well completion). This method could be also suitable for offshore fields because it doesn't require high energy consumption, or large surface areas, or high operating costs. It can also be suitable for those shallow reservoirs not suitable for injection processes. This paper presents details of this new technology and associated simulation results showing its range of implementation.},

abstract = {In the decade since the publication of the second edition of Scanning Electron Microscopy and X-Ray Microanalysis, there has been a great expansion in the capabilities of the basic scanning electron microscope (SEM) and the x-ray spectrometers. The emergence of the variab- pressure/environmental SEM has enabled the observation of samples c- taining water or other liquids or vapor and has allowed for an entirely new class of dynamic experiments, that of direct observation of che- cal reactions in situ. Critical advances in electron detector technology and computer-aided analysis have enabled structural (crystallographic) analysis of specimens at the micrometer scale through electron backscatter diffr- tion (EBSD). Low-voltage operation below 5 kV has improved x-ray spatial resolution by more than an order of magnitude and provided an effective route to minimizing sample charging. High-resolution imaging has cont- ued to develop with a more thorough understanding of how secondary el- trons are generated. The ?eld emission gun SEM, with its high brightness, advanced electron optics, which minimizes lens aberrations to yield an - fective nanometer-scale beam, and “through-the-lens” detector to enhance the measurement of primary-beam-excited secondary electrons, has made high-resolution imaging the rule rather than the exception. Methods of x-ray analysis have evolved allowing for better measurement of specimens with complex morphology: multiple thin layers of different compositions, and rough specimens and particles. Digital mapping has transformed classic x-ray area scanning, a purely qualitative technique, into fully quantitative compositional mapping.},

abstract = {A new computer program is described, GRINSP (geometrically restrained
inorganic structure prediction), which allows the exploration of
the possibilities of occurrence of 3-, 4-, 5- and 6-connected three-dimensional
networks. Hypothetical (as well as known structure) models for binary
compounds are produced with exclusive connection of polyhedra by
corners, such as [MX3] triangles in M2X3 formulation, [MX4] tetrahedra
in MX2 (zeolites or dense SiO2 polymorphs), [MX5] polyhedra in M2X5,
and finally [MX6] octahedra in MX3 polymorphs. Moreover, hypothetical
ternary compounds are built up by combinations of either two different
polyhedra or two different radii for two different cations adopting
the same coordination. The cost function is based on the agreement
of the model interatomic distances with ideal distances provided
by the user. The Monte Carlo algorithm first finds structure candidates
selected after the verification of the expected geometry, and then
optimizes the cell parameters and the atomic coordinates. A satellite
software (GRINS) uses the predicted models and produces the characteristics
of isostructural compounds which would be obtained by cationic substitutions.

nanotubes), zeolites, aluminium and 3d-element fluorides, fluoroaluminates,

abstract = {The ongoing depletion of light oil resources and the increasing global energy demand is driving oil{\&}gas companies towards the exploitation of unconventional oil resources. In order to extract crude oil from these resources, a sufficiently low oil viscosity must be achieved, for instance through temperature increase. Electromagnetic irradiation through downhole antennae can be a suitable method for in situ heating of reservoirs. Potential problems for this technique are the extremely high temperatures that can be reached at the well containing the radiating element and the strong dependence of temperature profiles on local variation of reservoir material properties. These problems can be solved to a large extent by inserting around the radiating well a tight shell made of a low loss dielectric material, and by selecting the proper irradiation frequency.The experimental work described in this paper aims to verify the effectiveness of a similar structure during the electromagnetic heating of over 2000. kg of oil sand in a sandbox up to 200. °C, using a dipolar antenna. Oil sand was irradiated at 2.45. GHz frequency with variable power (1-2. kW). The temperature in the oil sand mass and on the boundary were recorded throughout the test in several specific points, in order to estimate temperature profiles along the distance from the antenna.Experimental results confirmed that the presence of the low lossy material shell realized around the antenna is extremely efficient in lowering the temperature in this critical zone and in better distributing the irradiated energy in the oil sand mass. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},
