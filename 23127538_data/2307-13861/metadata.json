  "abstract": "Automated design of analog and radio-frequency circuits using supervised or reinforcement learning from simulation data has recently been studied as an alternative to manual expert design. It is straightforward for a design agent to learn an inverse function from desired performance metrics to circuit parameters. However, it is more common for a user to have threshold performance criteria rather than an exact target vector of feasible performance measures. In this work, we propose a method for generating from simulation data a dataset on which a system can be trained via supervised learning to design circuits to meet threshold specifications. We moreover perform the to-date most extensive evaluation of automated analog circuit design, including experimenting in a significantly more diverse set of circuits than in prior work, covering linear, nonlinear, and autonomous circuit configurations, and show that our method consistently reaches success rate better than 90% at 5% error margin, while also improving data efficiency by upward of an order of magnitude. A demo of this system is available at circuits.streamlit.app",
