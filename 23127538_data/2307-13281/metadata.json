  "abstract": "We study the injectivity of the cycle class map with values in Jannsen's continuous étale cohomology, by using refinements that go through étale motivic cohomology and the ``tame'' version of Jannsen's cohomology. In particular, we use this to show that the Tate and the Beilinson conjectures imply that its kernel is torsion in positive characteristic, and to revisit recent counterexamples to injectivity.",
