abstract = {This paper presents a study on how cooperation versus non-cooperation, and centralization versus distribution impact the performance of a traffic game of autonomous vehicles. A model using a particle-based, Lagrange representation, is developed, instead of an Eulerian, flow-based one, usual in routing problems of the game-theoretical approach. This choice allows representation of phenomena such as fuel exhaustion, vehicle collision, and wave propagation. The elements necessary to represent interactions in a multi-agent transportation system are defined, including a distributed, priority-based resource allocation protocol, where resources are nodes and links in a spatial network and individual routing strategies are performed. A fuel consumption dynamics is developed in order to account for energy cost and vehicles having limited range. The analysis shows that only the scenarios with cooperative resource allocation can achieve optimal values of either collective cost or equity coefficient, corresponding respectively to the centralized and to the distributed cases.}

abstract="ACAS Xu is an air-to-air collision avoidance system designed for unmanned aircraft that issues horizontal turn advisories to avoid an intruder aircraft. Due the use of a large lookup table in the design, a neural network compression of the policy was proposed. Analysis of this system has spurred a significant body of research in the formal methods community on neural network verification. While many powerful methods have been developed, most work focuses on open-loop properties of the networks, rather than the main point of the system---collision avoidance---which requires closed-loop analysis.",

abstract="We show that symmetry transformations and caching can enable scalable, and possibly unbounded, verification of multi-agent systems. Symmetry transformations map any solution of the system to another solution. We show that this property can be used to transform cached reachsets to compute new reachsets, for hybrid and multi-agent models. We develop a notion of a virtual system which defines symmetry transformations for a broad class of agent models that visit waypoint sequences. Using this notion of a virtual system, we present a prototype tool CacheReach that builds a cache of reachsets, in a way that is agnostic of the representation of the reachsets and the reachability analysis method used. Our experimental evaluation of CacheReach shows up to 64{\%} savings in safety verification computation time on multi-agent systems with 3-dimensional linear and 4-dimensional nonlinear fixed-wing aircraft models following sequences of waypoints. These savings and our theoretical results illustrate the potential benefits of using symmetry-based caching in the safety verification of multi-agent systems.",
