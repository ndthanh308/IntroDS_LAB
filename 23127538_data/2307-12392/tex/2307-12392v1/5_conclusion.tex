\section{Conclusions}

Our work introduces the IR-VG framework, which comprises IMVF, MRCS, and MFSD. It outperforms existing approaches in terms of context features, fine-grained features, and localization accuracy while addressing robustness issues when faced with irrelevant or inaccurate reference expressions. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of each module, achieving new SOTA performance.

\noindent \textbf{Limitation and future work.} Notably, IR-VG builds a new research direction for robust VG. Future work includes developing a more elegant framework to handle false alarms. In addition, we will explore the false-alarm problems with irrelevant expression for some foundation models (e.g. Grounding DINO~\cite{GDINO}).
