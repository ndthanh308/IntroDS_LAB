  "abstract": "Due to the cultural and governance differences of countries around the world, there currently exists a wide spectrum of AI regulation policy proposals that have created a chaos in the global AI regulatory space. Properly regulating AI technologies is extremely challenging, as it requires a delicate balance between legal restrictions and technological developments. In this article, we first present a comprehensive review of AI regulation proposals from different geographical locations and cultural backgrounds. Then, drawing from historical lessons, we develop a framework to facilitate a thorough analysis of AI regulation proposals. Finally, we perform a systematic analysis of these AI regulation proposals to understand how each proposal may fail. This study, containing historical lessons and analysis methods, aims to help governing bodies untangling the AI regulatory chaos through a divide-and-conquer manner.",
