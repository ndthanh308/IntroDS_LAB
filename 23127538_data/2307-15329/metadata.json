  "abstract": "Thanks to ``dust-to-planet'' simulations (DTPSs), which treat the collisional evolution directly from dust to giant-planet cores in a protoplanetary disk, we showed that giant-planet cores are formed in $\\lesssim 10\\,$au in several $10^5$ years, because porous pebbles grow into planetesimals via collisions prior to drift in 10 au (Kobayashi & Tanaka 2021, Paper I).However, such porous pebbles are unlikely to reproduce the polarized millimeter wavelength light observed from protoplanetary disks. We thus investigate gas-giant core formation with non-porous pebbles via DTPSs. Even non-porous bodies can grow into planetesimals and massive cores to be gas giants are also formed in several $10^5$ years. The rapid core formation is mainly via the accretion of planetesimals produced by collisional coagulation of pebbles drifting from the outer disk. The formation mechanism is similar to the case with porous pebbles, while core formation occurs in a wider region (5 - 10 au) than that with porous pebbles.",
