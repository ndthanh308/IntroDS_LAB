  "abstract": "A revised version of the compactness criterion for families of quantum operations in the strong convergence topology (obtained previously) is presented, along with a more detailed proof and the examples showing the necessity of this revision.\n  Several criteria for the existence of a limit point of a sequence of quantum operations w.r.t. the strong convergence are obtained and discussed.\n  Applications in different areas of quantum information theory are described.",
