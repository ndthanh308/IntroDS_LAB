  "abstract": "We consider two variants of those Abelian groups with all proper strongly invariant subgroups isomorphic and give an in-depth study of their basic and specific properties in either parallel or contrast to the Abelian groups with all proper fully invariant (respectively, characteristic) subgroups isomorphic, which are studied in details by the current authors in Commun. Algebra (2015) and in J. Commut. Algebra (2023). In addition, we also explore those Abelian groups having at least one proper strongly invariant subgroup isomorphic to the whole group.",
