  "abstract": "By a theorem of Christensen and Hovey, the category of non-negatively graded chain complexes has a model structure, called the h-model structure or Hurewicz model structure, where the weak equivalences are the chain homotopy equivalences. The Dold--Kan correspondence induces a model structure on the category of simplicial modules. In this paper, we give a description of the two model categories and some of their properties, notably the fact that both are monoidal.",
