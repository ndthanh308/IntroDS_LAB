With multiple robotic systems working in close proximity, decentralized collision avoidance is a major challenge in manipulator motion planning.
In this work, we developed a decentralized collision aware inverse kinematics solver that uses trust region based non-linear optimization to follow end-effector trajectories while avoiding collisions. 
We developed a fast and computationally efficient collision distance computation method. 
With only the current joint positions of the external arms and robot model exposed, DawnIK can successfully avoid collisions in the most challenging scenarios. 
The results show that DawnIK is better than a state of the art inverse kinematic solver at balancing between trajectory tracking and collision avoidance.
In scenarios where the probability of collision is low, DawnIK shows better performance at trajectory tracking. 
On the other hand, in scenarios where collision is imminent, DawnIK prioritizes collision avoidance. 
Finally, we also demonstrated that we can enable independent yet simultaneous control of multiple arms using DawnIK solver for trajectory tracking while avoiding collisions with each other efficiently.
