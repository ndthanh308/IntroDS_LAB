In this work, we consider the case where the motion of one or more arms are controlled in close proximity, but independent of, multiple other arms. 
The arm whose motion the inverse kinematics solver computes is referred to as the controlled arm. 
The arms that are controlled externally are active obstacles for the controlled arm, and are referred to as external arms.
In addition to the full access to the controlled arm's states, the solver has access to the robot model and current joint positions of the external arms.
Given a desired end-effector pose, we address the problem of computing the joint configuration of the controlled arm that can attain this end-effector pose while avoiding collisions with the external arms, without using environment perception to sense the external arm states. 

Formally put, given the controlled arm with with $n$ joints, whose current joint states are $ q^{\mathit{curr}}_i, i = 1...n$, current end-effector pose $ee^{\mathit{curr}}_{\mathit{pose}}$ and desired end-effector pose $ee^{\mathit{des}}_{\mathit{pose}}$, and neighboring robot arms with cumulative $m$ joints whose current joint states are $ q^{\mathit{curr}}_j, j = 1...m$,  the inverse kinematics solver finds a new set of joint commands $q^{\mathit{cmd}}_i$ for the controlled robot arm that satisfy the different constraints while being as close as possible to $ee^{\mathit{des}}_{\mathit{pose}}$.
We consider end-effector pose reaching as one of the constraints along with other constraints.
