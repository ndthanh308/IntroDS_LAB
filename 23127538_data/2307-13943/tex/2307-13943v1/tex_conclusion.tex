\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we proposed a new principled optimization method that seamlessly integrates topological information to develop strong OOD resilience.
% Theoretical analysis that proves our method enjoys fast convergence for both convex and non-convex loss functions while the generalization risk is tightly bounded.
Empirical results in a wide range of tasks including classification, regression, and semantic segmentation demonstrate the superior performance of our method over SOTA.
Moreover, the data-driven distributional topology is consistent with domain knowledge and facilitates the explainability of our approach.
