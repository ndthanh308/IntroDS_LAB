  "abstract": "We provide an example for the generating matrix $A$ of a two-dimensional lattice $Γ= A\\mathbb{Z}^2$, such that the following holds: For any sufficiently smooth and localized mother wavelet $ψ$, there is a constant $β(A,ψ)>0$, such that $βΓ\\cap (\\mathbb{R}\\times\\mathbb{R}^+)$ is a set of stable sampling for the wavelet system generated by $ψ$, for all $0<β\\leq β(A,ψ)$. The result and choice of the generating matrix are loosely inspired by the studies of low discrepancy sequences and uniform distribution modulo $1$. In particular, we estimate the number of lattice points contained in any axis parallel rectangle of fixed area. This estimate is combined with a recent sampling result for continuous wavelet systems, obtained via the oscillation method of general coorbit theory.",
