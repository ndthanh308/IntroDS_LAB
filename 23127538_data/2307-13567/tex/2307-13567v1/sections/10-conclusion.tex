\section{Conclusion}
Reusing existing charts with layouts determined by multiple factors has the potential to significantly transform the process and experience of visualization authoring, further lowering barriers to crafting bespoke charts. In this paper, we contribute Mystique, an interactive tool that brings us closer to realizing that potential. Mystique automates axis \& legend detection and chart deconstruction, and asks for minimal human input to fix detection errors and specify data mappings. We demonstrate that our mixed-initiative deconstruction approach can achieve above 96\% accuracy on charts with diverse layouts and designs. 
% The comparison with three related tools that support example reuse on eight dimensions highlights Mystique's unique advantages. 
In addition, the chart reproduction study with 12 participants demonstrates that the guided process in Mystique's wizard interface is easy to follow and removes the need to learn a new language or framework. We outline research challenges and opportunities for future work, including broadening the scope to composite designs and enhancing Mystique with additional features.
