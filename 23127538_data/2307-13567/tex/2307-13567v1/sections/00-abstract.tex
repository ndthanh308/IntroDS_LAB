%To enable reusing existing visualizations without requiring users to learn a new language or framework, previous research has examined how to obtain a semantic understanding of a chart by deconstructing its visual representation into reusable components such as encodings. However, existing deconstruction approaches are limited because they primarily focus on style, not layout. In this paper, we investigate how to identify multiple factors that can jointly determine the layout of a range of rectangle-based charts, representing diverse designs and styles. We adopt a mixed-initiative approach to extract the axes and legends and deconstruct a chart's layout into four semantic components: mark groups, spatial relationships, data encodings, and graphical constraints. Based on the deconstruction results, we design a wizard assistant interface to guide the authors through a series of steps to specify how these components map to their data. On 150 rectangle-based SVG charts representing diverse structures, Mystique achieves 90\% accuracy for axis and legend extraction and 96\% accuracy for chart deconstruction. In a chart reproduction study, participants could easily reuse existing charts on new datasets. We discuss the current limitations of Mystique and future research directions.
To facilitate the reuse of existing charts, previous research has examined how to obtain a semantic understanding of a chart by deconstructing its visual representation into reusable components, such as encodings. However, existing deconstruction approaches primarily focus on chart styles, handling only basic layouts. In this paper, we investigate how to deconstruct chart layouts, focusing on rectangle-based ones as they cover not only 17 chart types but also advanced layouts (e.g., small multiples, nested layouts). We develop an interactive tool, called Mystique, adopting a mixed-initiative approach to extract the axes and legend, and deconstruct a chart's layout into four semantic components: mark groups, spatial relationships, data encodings, and graphical constraints. Mystique employs a wizard interface that guides chart authors through a series of steps to specify how the deconstructed components map to their own data. On 150 rectangle-based SVG charts, Mystique achieves above 85\% accuracy for axis and legend extraction and 96\% accuracy for layout deconstruction. In a chart reproduction study, participants could easily reuse existing charts on new datasets. We discuss the current limitations of Mystique and future research directions.
