%% Abstract section.
\abstract{%
% We present \textit{Mystique}, an interactive tool designed for constructing expressive charts by reusing chart layouts.
% In contrast to previous approaches, which primarily focus on chart styles, Mystique identifies the factors that dictate the spatial arrangements of visual marks and supports the reuse of charts with complex layouts.
% % Mystique enables authors to reuse the structure and visual styles of existing SVG charts composed of rectangle marks, eliminating the need to create a chart from scratch.
% Given an SVG chart, Mystique first extracts the axes and legend using heuristics, and lets the authors correct inference errors through simple interaction. 
% Mystique then deconstructs the chart content into semantic components that determine the chart layout---mark groups, spatial relationships, data encodings, and graphical constraints. 
% Its wizard assistant then guides the authors through a series of steps to specify how these components map to their data. 
% On 150 rectangle-based SVG charts representing diverse structures, Mystique achieves 90\% accuracy for axis and legend extraction and 96\% accuracy for chart deconstruction. 
% In a chart reproduction study, participants could easily reuse existing charts on new datasets. 
% We discuss the current limitations of Mystique and future research directions.

\section{Troubleshooting}
\label{appendix:troubleshooting}

\subsection{ifpdf error}

If you receive compilation errors along the lines of \texttt{Package ifpdf Error: Name clash, \textbackslash ifpdf is already defined} then please add a new line \verb|\let\ifpdf\relax| right after the \verb|\documentclass[journal]{vgtc}| call.
Note that your error is due to packages you use that define \verb|\ifpdf| which is obsolete (the result is that \verb|\ifpdf| is defined twice); these packages should be changed to use \verb|ifpdf| package instead.


\subsection{\texttt{pdfendlink} error}

Occasionally (for some \LaTeX\ distributions) this hyper-linked bib\TeX\ style may lead to \textbf{compilation errors} (\texttt{pdfendlink ended up in different nesting level ...}) if a reference entry is broken across two pages (due to a bug in \verb|hyperref|).
In this case, make sure you have the latest version of the \verb|hyperref| package (i.e.\ update your \LaTeX\ installation/packages) or, alternatively, revert back to \verb|\bibliographystyle{abbrv-doi}| (at the expense of removing hyperlinks from the bibliography) and try \verb|\bibliographystyle{abbrv-doi-hyperref}| again after some more editing.
