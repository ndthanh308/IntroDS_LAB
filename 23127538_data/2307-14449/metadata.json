  "abstract": "A fluid-dynamic approach to charm-quark diffusion in the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is developed for the first time. Results for integrated yields and momentum distributions of charmed hadrons obtained with a fluid-dynamic description for the dynamics of the QGP coupled to an additional heavy-quark-antiquark current are shown. In addition to the thermodynamic Equation of State (EoS), this description uses a heavy-quark diffusion constant which we take from Lattice QCD calculations. The results describe quantitatively experimental data measured at the LHC at the center-of-mass energy of $\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV up to $p_{\\rm T}\\sim$ 4-5 GeV/$c$, showing that charm quarks undergo a very fast hydrodynamization in the medium created by ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions.",
