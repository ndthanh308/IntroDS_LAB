  abstract =     {Nonuniform rational B-spline (NURBS) curves and their
                  associated techniques are of major importance in computer
                  aided geometric design. The paper discusses planar rational
                  B-spline motions. These are planar motions in which all point
                  paths are NURBS curves. Such motions are connected with a
                  linear control structure, which can be used to apply
                  algorithms developed for the design of curves and surfaces
                  directly to the design of planar motions. The first part of
                  the paper gives a brief introduction to plane kinematics and
                  the theory of kinematic mappings. Rational motions and the
                  application of the corresponding control structures are
                  discussed in detail. The second part of the paper presents a
                  $C^2$ interpolation scheme with rational motions of degree 4,
                  which is the minimum degree for motions which have positions
                  with vanishing angular velocity.}
