  "abstract": "In this article, we will construct an overconstrained closed-loop linkage consisting of four revolute and one cylindrical joint. It is obtained by factorization of a prescribed vertical Darboux motion. We will investigate the kinematic behaviour of the obtained mechanism, which turns out to have multiple operation modes. Under certain conditions on the design parameters, two of the operation modes will correspond to vertical Darboux motions. It turns out, that for these design parameters, there also exists a second assembly mode.",
