\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this work, we present ViSkill, a novel value-informed skill chaining framework for policy learning of long-horizon surgical robot tasks. ViSkill learns subgoal-based subtask policies in decomposed long-horizon tasks, and subsequently learns a chaining policy associated with a value function to smoothly connect these policies for accomplishing the entire task.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on three long-horizon surgical robot tasks from the surgical simulation platform, where significant improvements in task success rates have been achieved. We also demonstrate the deployment of the learned policies on the dVRK hardware.

During our real-world deployment, we observed a few instances of failure, which we attribute to the exacerbation of the sim-real gap in long-horizon tasks. For instance, in Fig.~\ref{fig:dvrk}, a slight orientation of the block led to failed task execution. This motivates further investigation of sim-to-real adaptation methods in future work for advancing the automation of surgical robots. Furthermore, investigating the possibility of reducing the hand-crafted design to decompose tasks is also desirable to further improve the scalability of the system.
