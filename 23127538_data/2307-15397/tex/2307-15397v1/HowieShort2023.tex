\section{Introduction}\label{intro} 


\noindent   
Recall that a {\em Magnus subgroup} of a one-relator group $G=\<X\mid R=1\>$ is the subgroup generated by a subset of the generating set $X$ omitting at least one generator that occurs in $R$.
In two articles \cite{C1,C2}, Collins gave a complete analysis of the possible intersections of Magnus subgroups and their conjugates in a one-relator group.

\begin{thm}[\cite{C1}]\label{Co1}
	If $M(Y),M(Z)$ are the Magnus subgroups of $G$ generated by $Y,Z\subset X$ respectively, then the intersection of $M(Y)$ and $M(Z)$ in $G$ is either the Magnus subgroup $M(Y\cap Z)$ or $M(Y\cap Z)*C$ for some cyclic group $C$.
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}[\cite{C2}]\label{Co2}
	If $g\in G$ and the intersection of $M(Y)$ and $g^{-1}M(Z)g$ in $G$ is not cyclic, then there are elements $h\in M(Z)$ and $k\in M(Y)$ such that $g=hk$ in $G$.
\end{thm}

Note that, in the conclusion of Theorem \ref{Co2} we have $h^{-1}M(Z)h=M(Z)$ and $k^{-1}M(Y)k=M(Y)$, so $M(Y)\cap g^{-1}M(Z)g=k^{-1}(M(Y)\cap M(Z))k$ and Theorem \ref{Co1} applies.

In the case of a one-relator group with torsion, the above results can be strengthened \cite{C1}: The second case $M(Y\cap Z)*C$ in Theorem \ref{Co1} cannot occur, and in Theorem \ref{Co2} one can replace ``cyclic'' by ``trivial''.

In \cite{H05}, the first-named author generalised Theorem \ref{Co1} -- and also the stronger version in the torsion case -- to the situation of one-relator products of locally indicable groups.
The purpose of the present paper is to provide analogous generalisations of both versions of Theorem \ref{Co2}.  Specifically, we prove the following two results.

\begin{thmA}\label{main}
	Let $\{G_\lambda;\lambda\in\Lambda\}$ be a collection of locally indicable groups, let $R\in \ast_{\lambda\in\Lambda} G_\lambda$ be a cyclically reduced word of free product length at least $2$, and let $G:=(\ast_{\lambda\in\Lambda} G_\lambda)/\<\<R\>\>$, where $\<\<R\>\>$ denotes the normal closure of $R$.  Let $I,J$ be subsets of $\Lambda$ and $g\in \ast_{\lambda\in\Lambda} G_\lambda$.  If the intersection of $\ast_{i\in I} G_i$ and
	$g^{-1}\cdot\left(\ast_{j\in J} G_j\right)\cdot g$
	in $G$ is not cyclic, then there are elements $h\in \ast_{j\in J} G_j$ and $k\in \ast_{i\in I} G_i$ such that $g=hk$ in $G$.
\end{thmA}


\begin{thmA}\label{maintorsion}
	Let $G$ be as in Theorem \ref{main} with $R=Z^m$ in $\ast_{\lambda\in\Lambda} G_\lambda$ for some $Z\in \ast_{\lambda\in\Lambda} G_\lambda$ and some $m>1$. If the intersection of $\ast_{i\in I} G_i$ and 
	$g^{-1}\cdot\left(\ast_{j\in J} G_j\right)\cdot g$
	in $G$ is not trivial, then there are elements $h\in \ast_{j\in J} G_j$ and $k\in \ast_{i\in I} G_i$ such that $g=hk$ in $G$.
\end{thmA}

Our proofs will make extensive use of the following special case of Theorem \ref{main} due to Brodsky \cite[Theorem 6]{B81} (see also \cite[Theorem F]{HS}).

\begin{thm}\label{BrodskyLemma}
	Let $G$ be as in Theorem \ref{main}.  If $g\in G$ and $\lambda,\mu\in\Lambda$ are such that the intersection in $G$ of $G_\lambda$ and $g^{-1}G_\mu g$ is not cyclic, then $\lambda=\mu$ and $g\in G_\lambda$.
\end{thm}

We also require the following stronger version when the relator is a proper power.  See \cite[Corollary 3.7]{HS}.

\begin{thm}\label{BrodskyTorsion}
	Let $G$ be as in Theorem \ref{maintorsion}.  If $g\in G$ and $\lambda,\mu\in\Lambda$ are such that the intersection in $G$ of $G_\lambda$ and $g^{-1}G_\mu g$ is not trivial, then $\lambda=\mu$ and $g\in G_\lambda$.
\end{thm}

Other results on locally indicable groups from the literature that we will use include the following:


\begin{thm}[Freiheitssatz,\cite{B80},\cite{H81},\cite{S81}]\label{Freiheitssatz}
	
	Let $A,B$ be locally indicable groups and $R\in A*B$ 
	a cyclically reduced word of length at least two. 
	
	The  natural map $A\to \frac{A*B}{\<\< R\>\>}$ is injective.	
\end{thm}

\begin{thm}[Weinbaum's Theorem, \cite{H82}]\label{Weinbaum}
	Let $A,B$ be locally indicable groups and $R\in A*B$ 
	a cyclically reduced word of length at least two. 
	
	No proper subword of $R$ represents the identity element of $\frac{A*B}{\<\< R\>\>}$. 
	
\end{thm} 

\begin{thm}[\cite{H82}]\label{Gli}
	Let $A,B$ be locally indicable groups and $R\in A*B$ 
	a cyclically reduced word of length at least two which is not a proper power in $A*B$. 
	Then $\frac{A*B}{\<\< R\>\>}$ is locally indicable. 
\end{thm}
A {\em right ordering} on a group $G$ is a total order $<$ such that $(\forall ~x,y,z\in G)$ $y<z\Rightarrow yx<zx$.  
A group is {\em right orderable} if it has a right ordering.

\begin{thm}[\cite{BH}]\label{lilo}
	Every locally indicable group is right orderable.
\end{thm}
 

In \S \ref{prelims} 
we reformulate the main theorems in terms of 2--complexes with
two distinguished sets of edges.  
We explain 
why the proof of Theorem \ref{main} reduces to consideration of a free subgroup $K<[G,G]$ of rank $2$ in the conjugacy intersection.
Also 
we explain how pictures are to be used, 
and the essential use of a right order to select maximal and minimal edges
on each disc in the pictures is described.

In \S3 we use the methods of \S \ref{prelims} to prove the torsion version of the main theorem, Theorem \ref{maintorsion}.
 
We begin \S4 with the plan for the proof in the torsion-free case, Theorem \ref{main}, which is broken into
several stages.  We then  introduce a notion of complexity that forms the basis for an inductive proof.

We make some technical adjustments to our $2$-complex, and prove the initial step of the induction. 
The inductive step involves lifting our pictures to a suitable cover; and then splits into two cases.  The first of these is when the lifted annular pictures contain a relabelled disc meeting all the edges 
lying in the generators of $K$: 
this is handled in \S \ref{first}.  The other, more complicated, case is dealt with in the final three sections.  In \S \ref{restrict} we reduce to consideration of one particular conjugating element; in \S \ref{formW1} we show that annular pictures for conjugacies with that particular conjugating element have a special form; and finally in \S \ref{finalcurtain} we use that special form to complete the proof. 

 



\section{Preliminaries}\label{prelims} 

\subsection{Reformulation and reductions} \label{refandreds}

$$ $$
\vskip -0.8cm

\noindent\underline{Reduction 1} It suffices to prove Theorems \ref{main} and \ref{maintorsion} for the case where
$\Lambda=I\cup J$.


Suppose that $\Lambda \setminus (I\cup J)\neq \emptyset$ and set $D=\ast_{\lambda\in\Lambda \setminus (I\cup J)} G_\lambda$.

\smallskip	
\noindent	
If $R$ contains no occurrences from $D$, then $\frac{(\ast_{j\in \Lambda} G_\lambda)}{\<\<R\>\>} = \bigl(\frac{\ast_{\lambda\in I\cup J} G_\lambda}{\<\<R\>\>}\bigr) *D$, 
and in a free product, 
elements of a factor are  conjugate if
and only if they are conjugate in that factor, and the conjugating element is an element of the same factor.

Now suppose  that  $R$ contains  occurrences in $D$.
Write $A=\ast_{i\in I\setminus J}G_i$, $B=\ast_{j\in J\setminus I}G_j$, $C=\ast_{\lambda\in I\cap J}G_\lambda$.
By the Freiheitssatz (Theorem \ref{Freiheitssatz}) we may regard $A*B*C$ as a subgroup of $G$.  The conjugacy intersection of interest  is contained in $(A*B*C)\cap g^{-1}(A*B*C)g$, and the relevant version of 
Brodsky's Theorem (\ref{BrodskyLemma} or \ref{BrodskyTorsion}) 
applies to say that the conjugating element $g$ lies in the subgroup $A*B*C$. 
The result then follows from the conjugacy properties of free products as above.


	So from now on we shall assume that $\Lambda = I\cup J$.

\smallskip


\noindent\underline{Reformulation}	 We rephrase   Theorems \ref{main} and \ref{maintorsion} in terms of 2--complexes.	

Let $Y=X\cup\cS\cup\cT\cup\alpha$ be a connected 2--complex, where :
\begin{enumerate}
	\item[$\bullet$]$X$ is a 2--complex 
	(not necessarily connected),  
	\item[$\bullet$] each component of $X$  has locally indicable (possibly trivial)
	fundamental group, 
	\item[$\bullet$] $\cS,\cT$ are  disjoint, non--empty sets of edges,
	\item[$\bullet$] $\alpha$ is a 2-cell adjoined by identifying its boundary with the loop in $X^{(1)}\cup\cS\cup\cT$, 
	labelled $R=Z^m$ where $Z=u_1x_1u_2x_2\dots u_kx_k$ and $m\ge 1$,
\item[$\bullet$] $Z$ does not represent a proper power in $\pi_1(X\cup\cS\cup\cT)$, 
	\item[$\bullet$]  each $u_i$ in $Z$ is $e^{\pm1}$ for some edge $e\in\cS\cup\cT$, 
	each $x_i$ is  an  edge-path of length at most $1$ 
in (some component of) $X^{(1)}$,
\item[$\bullet$] $Z$ is cyclically reduced: if $x_j$ is a  nullhomotopic loop or vertex in $X$ 
then $u_{j+1}\ne u_j^{-1}$ 
(indices mod $k$), 
	\item[$\bullet$] every edge $e\in\cS\cup\cT$ occurs in $Z$  (in particular  $k\ge 2$).
\end{enumerate}   



\smallskip\noindent
The conditions ensure that $\pi_1(Y)$ is a one--relator product
$$(F * (*_{\lambda\in\Lambda} G_\lambda ))/\<\<R\>\>$$
where $F$ is a free group (possibly trivial), 
and the $G_\lambda$ are the fundamental groups of the components of $X$. 
Let $$\ol{G}:=(F * (*_{\lambda\in\Lambda} G_\lambda ))/\<\<Z\>\>.$$
Then  
$\ol{G}$ is itself locally indicable. 
In particular when $m=1$ we have $R=Z$ and 
$\pi_1(Y)=G=\ol{G}$ is locally indicable.

\begin{thm}[Collins for complexes]\label{2ComplexVersion}
	$$ $$
	\vskip -0.8cm
	
	
	Suppose that $U_1,U_2,V_1,V_2, Q$ are   paths in $Y^{(1)}$ such that:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item[] $U_1, U_2$ are closed paths in $X^{(1)}\cup\cS$ based at a vertex $v_0$;
		\item[] $V_1, V_2$ are closed paths in $X^{(1)}\cup\cT$ based at a vertex $v_1$;
		\item[] $Q$ is a path in $Y^{(1)}$  from $v_0$ to $v_1$;
		\item[] there are homotopies $Q^{-1}U_iQ=V_i$ in $Y$ for $i=1,2$.
		\item[]   Let $K$ denote the subgroup of $\pi_1(Y,v_0)$ generated by $U_1$ and $U_2$.  
			Suppose in addition that either:
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item[(for Theorem \ref{main})] $ K$ is not cyclic; or
			\item[(for Theorem \ref{maintorsion})]  $m\ge 2$ and $K$ is non-trivial.
		\end{enumerate} 
	\end{enumerate}
	Then $Q$ is homotopic rel endpoints in $Y$ to a path $Q_1\cdot Q_2$ where $Q_1$ is in $X\cup\cS$ and
	$Q_2$ is in $X\cup\cT$. 		
\end{thm}

This is the theorem we shall prove.   
Theorems \ref{main} and \ref{maintorsion} follow  from Theorem \ref{2ComplexVersion} by taking:

$X_1$  a  one-vertex 2-complex with  fundamental group $A=\ast_{i\in I\setminus J} G_i$,  

$X_2$  a  one-vertex 2-complex with fundamental group $C=\ast_{i\in I\cap J} G_i$ ,

$X_3$  a  one-vertex  2-complex with fundamental group $B=\ast_{j\in J\setminus I} G_j$, 

$X=X_1\cup X_2 \cup X_3$,

$\cS=\{s\}$ a single edge joining the vertex of $X_2$ to that of $X_1$,

$\cT=\{t\}$ a single edge joining the vertex of $X_2$ to that of $X_3$,

$\alpha$ a 2-cell adjoined identifying its boundary with the path $R''$ obtained as follows:
write the word
	$R=a_1a_2\dots a_k$ in cyclically reduced form: where $a_i$ is in some factor $A$, $B$ or $C$, 
and $a_{i+1}$  is in a different factor from $a_i$ (modulo $k$)  
(in particular $a_i\neq 1$). 
Then the  	corresponding closed path is 
	 $R'= b_1\dots b_k$ where $b_i=s\g_is^{-1}$ if $a_i\in A$, $\g_i$ is a path in $X_1^{(1)}$ representing $a_i$, $b_i=t\g_it^{-1}$ if $a_i\in B$, $\g_i$ is a path in $X_3^{(1)}$ representing $a_i$, and
$b_i=\g_i$ if $a_i\in C$, $\g_i$ is a path in $X_2^{(1)}$ representing $a_i$. 
  We may suppose that each $\g_i$ is in fact an edge  
  in $X$ ($a_i\neq 1$) to match the description in the Reformulation;
if necessary add an edge $x_i$ for the path $\g_i$,
and a 2-cell with boundary  $x_i \g_i^{-1}$. 
Theorems \ref{main} and \ref{maintorsion} now follow immediately from Theorem \ref{2ComplexVersion} (after Reduction 1)
with $Y= X\cup\cS\cup\cT\cup\alpha$   where $\a$ is
attached along the path $R''$, the path obtained by cyclically reducing the path $R'$ in $Y^{(1)}$.

\smallskip	

\noindent\underline{Reduction 2} \ 
In the torsion-free case, it suffices to prove Theorem \ref{2ComplexVersion} 
for the case $U_1,U_2$ generate a free group of rank 2.
This is because any non--cyclic subgroup contains a rank 2 free subgroup, 
or is conjugate into a factor, as follows. 

For each component $X_i$ of $X$, $\pi_1(X_i)$ is a free factor of $\pi_1(X\cup\cS\cup\cT)$, and
indeed $\pi_1(X\cup\cS\cup\cT) \cong \pi_1(X_i) * D$ where $D$ is isomorphic to the free product of the
fundamental groups of the other components and a free factor.  
Since $R$ is not contained in $X_i$, 
it follows that $D$ is locally indicable and not trivial,
and  $\pi_1(X_i)$ is naturally included in  $\pi_1(Y)$ as a subgroup
by  Theorem \ref{Freiheitssatz}.


For any  component $N$ of $X\cup\cS$,  the fundamental group  (choosing a  base  point in $N$)
$\pi_1(N)$ is a free product of the fundamental groups of the components $X_i$ in $N$ and  a free group,
and the Kurosh subgroup theorem says any subgroup 
is  a free product of conjugates in $\pi_1(N)$ of subgroups of the $\pi_1(X_i)$
and a free group. 

If the subgroup $K$ generated by $U_1,U_2$ is  non--cyclic and contains no 
rank 2 free subgroup, then $K$ is conjugate in $\pi_1(N)<\pi_1(X\cup\cS)$ 
(for some component $N$ of $X\cup\cS$, with $v_0$ in $N$) 
to a  subgroup of some $\pi_1(X_i)$ for some $i$.
Similarly the subgroup $L$ generated by $V_1,V_2$ is conjugate  in $\pi_1(N')<\pi_1(X\cup\cT)$ 
(for some component $N'$ of $X\cup\cT$, with  
$v_1$ in $N'$) 
to a subgroup of  some $\pi_1(X_j)$. 
In this case   Theorem \ref{BrodskyLemma} applies 
to give that $X_i=X_j$, and the path $Q$ 
is homotopic rel endpoints into $X_i$, which is stronger that the result claimed.
 
	Note that we can further assume that $U_1,U_2$ lie in the commutator subgroup of $\pi_1(Y,v_0)$,
	by replacing them by commutators of powers of the original $U_1,U_2$ if necessary. 
 
 \smallskip
\noindent{\bf Definition:} 
Let $Q$ be an edge path in $Y^{(1)}$: 
define a {\it $(Y,Q)$ Collins counter--example\/}, abbreviated to $(Y,Q)$-CCE,
to be  a quadruple $(U_1, U_2,V_1,V_2)$ with $U_1, U_2$ closed edge paths in $X\cup\cS$ based at $v_0$, 
the initial vertex of $Q$, and
$V_1,V_2$ are closed edge paths in $X\cup\cT$ based at $v_1$ the final vertex of $Q$.
Moreover   for $i=1,2$, the closed path $QV_iQ^{-1}U_i^{-1}$ is nullhomotopic in $Y$, 
and $U_1,U_2$   generate a rank 2 free subgroup of  
	the commutator subgroup of $\pi_1(Y,v_0)$. 
The $(Y,Q)$-CCE is {\it trivial\/} if $Q$ is   homotopic rel end-points to a concatenation $Q_1\cdot Q_2$
with $Q_1$ in $X\cup\cS$ and $Q_2$ in $X\cup\cT$.

\smallskip
The task now  for the proof of Theorem \ref{2ComplexVersion} in the torsion-free case 
-- and hence also of Theorem \ref{main} -- is to prove that there are no
non--trivial CCEs. 

\subsection{Pictures} 

We shall  make use of the duals of van Kampen diagrams, 
known as {\em pictures}.  
Originally a van Kampen diagram over a presentation was 
a finite decomposition of a surface (usually a disc or an annulus)
as a 2-complex mapping cellularly to the standard 2-complex for the presentation.
Pictures were introduced by Rourke in \cite{Rou} and studied in  the relative context by the second author \cite{S81}. 
We generalise slightly the original definition.
A picture arises from a continuous map $\Sigma\to Y$, where $\Sigma$ is a compact orientable surface,
here a disc or an annulus and $Y$ a $2$-complex,
using transversality.  It consists of a finite collection of {\em discs} or {\em (fat) vertices}, 
whose interiors each map homeomorphically onto the interior of a $2$-cell of $Y$, 
and a properly embedded $1$-submanifold of the complement of the interiors of the discs, 
each component of which is called an {\em arc}, carries a transverse orientation and is labelled by a $1$-cell of $X$. 
A small regular neighbourhood of each arc is mapped to the corresponding $1$-cell in the direction of the transverse orientation.  
The  generalisation of the original pictures is that we do not insist that the 1--cells in $Y$ be
loops.	
For more details on pictures, and examples of their usefulness in group theory we refer the reader to \cite{DH}, \cite{H4}.


For the proofs of our main theorems, 
we are interested here in  pictures over 
$Y=X\cup\cS\cup\cT\cup\alpha$, where $X$ is a 2--complex 
(not necessarily connected),  $\cS,\cT$ are sets of edges, and $\alpha$ is a 2-cell, such that $Y$ is connected.
We get a {\it relative picture\/} over $Y$  (relative to $\cS\cup\cT\cup\alpha$)
by removing from the picture all discs that do not
map to $\alpha$, and all arcs other than those labelled in $\cS\cup\cT$.
Segments of the boundaries of the $\a$ discs and of $\Sigma$ 
between $\cS\cup\cT$ arcs are labelled by words describing paths in  $X$.
In particular we shall be interested in  loops in $Y$ 
of the form $U=Q_1VQ_2^{-1}$ where $U$ is a loop in $X\cup \cS$ based at $v_0$,
$V$ is a loop in $X\cup\cT$ based at $v_1$,
and $Q_1,Q_2$ paths in $Y^{(1)}$ from $v_0$ to $v_1$. 
There is an obvious way to draw a corresponding picture 
as a rectangle  with top side labelled $U$, bottom side labelled $V$ and vertical sides labelled $Q_1,Q_2$.

% Figure environment removed

When $Q_2=Q_1$, the vertical sides can be identified to give a   picture on 
an annulus.
We refer to these as rectangular and annular relative  pictures. 
Given two such rectangular pictures   $\G,\G'$ for $U=Q_1 V Q_2^{-1}$ and for $U'=Q_2V'Q_3^{-1}$,
the right hand side of one can be identified with the left hand side of the other to
give a rectangular picture for the  
nullhomotopy $UU'=Q_1(VV')Q_3^{-1}$ 
 which (after reduction of cancelling 2-cells) we denote $\G+\G'$. 
Indeed the set of such rectangular pictures  
(modulo a suitable homotopy relation) can be given a groupoid structure with
this gluing operation. 
Reflecting the rectangular picture $\Gamma$ in a vertical mirror provides 
an inverse, which we write $-\Gamma$.


 
 
	\subsection{Syllables and syllable length} 
	In analogy with a commonly used terminology for words in a free product with amalgamation, we will use the term {\em syllable} to denote a subpath of a path in $X\cup\cS\cup\cT$ which contains $\cS$-edges or $\cT$-edges but not both, and is maximal with respect to that property -- except possibly for an initial and/or a terminal sub-path that is  contained in $X$.  
	We will speak of $\cS$-syllables and $\cT$-syllables with the obvious meaning.   The {\em syllable length} $SL(P)$ of a path $P$ is defined to be the number of syllables into which it can be subdivided.   

\smallskip  
We will also use another measure of length: the {\em $\cS\cup\cT$ length} of a path in $Y^{(1)}$ is the number of occurrences of edges from $\cS^{\pm1}\cup\cT^{\pm1}$. 




\subsection{Strong reduction}	  


An edge-path in $X^{(1)}\cup\cS\cup\cT$ is said to be {\em strongly reduced} if it is reduced and has no subpath of form $u^\varepsilon\cdot\g\cdot u^{-\varepsilon}$ with $u\in\cS\cup\cT$, $\varepsilon=\pm1$, and $\g$ a closed path in $X^{(1)}$ that is nullhomotopic in $X$. Every path in $X^{(1)}\cup\cS\cup\cT$ is homotopic rel end-points in $X\cup\cS\cup\cT$ to a strongly reduced path.  A closed path in $X^{(1)}\cup\cS\cup\cT$ is {\em strongly cyclically reduced} if each of its cyclic subpaths is strongly reduced.  Every closed path in $X^{(1)}\cup\cS\cup\cT$ is freely homotopic in $X\cup\cS\cup\cT$ to a strongly cyclically reduced path.
For example,  the closed path $\partial\a$ in $X^{(1)}\cup\cS\cup\cT$ is strongly cyclically reduced.



\medskip
We introduce a move on rectangular and annular relative pictures called {\em boundary surgery}.  This consists of cutting an $\cS$-arc (resp $\cT$-arc) close to the top (resp. bottom) boundary and moving the cut ends onto the top (resp. bottom)  boundary.  The inverse move identifies a pair of adjacent arcs on the top or bottom boundary if they have the same label, opposite orientations, and are separated on the boundary by a path labelled by a nullhomotopic closed path in $X$. 



We shall suppose that our annular pictures have 
	strongly reduced boundaries. 
For an annular  picture it may be that the top or bottom label is not strongly cyclically reduced, 
even if it was formed from a 
rectangular picture with strongly reduced labels on each side.  
We may again perform boundary surgeries on such a picture.  
If the original picture represented a conjugacy equation $U=QVQ^{-1}$ 
with $U$ based at $v_0$ and
$V$ based at $v_1$   
then the surgered version will represent a slightly different conjugacy equation $U'=Q'V'{Q'}^{-1}$.  
Here $U'$ is a conjugate of $U$ in the edge labels in $X\cup\cS$ -- say $U'=\sigma U\sigma^{-1}$ with
$U'$ a loop based at a vertex $v_0'$ and  $\sigma\in X^{(1)}\cup\cS$
a path from 
$v_0'$   to $v_0$.     
Similarly $V'=\tau^{-1}V\tau$ with $V'$ a loop in $X^{(1)}\cup\cT$ based at a vertex $v_1'$
and $\tau\in X^{(1)}\cup\cT$
a path from 
$v_1'$   to $v_1$.

Abusing notation, we shall write $Q\pi_1(X\cup\cT,v_1)Q^{-1}$ for the subgroup of $\pi_1(Y,v_0)$
of the homotopy classes $[Q\gamma Q^{-1}]$ for all $[\gamma]\in\pi_1(X\cup\cT,v_1)$.

 
\subsection{Brodsky's Theorem(s) for $2$-complexes}

We reformulate  Theorems \ref{BrodskyLemma}   and \ref{BrodskyTorsion}  for 2--complexes as follows:


\begin{lem}[Brodsky Theorem for complexes]\label{Br}
	Let $\mathcal{Y}$ be  a  $2$-complex of the form $\mathcal{Y}=X\cup E\cup \a$	 
	for some non-empty set $E$ of $1$-cells and $\a$ a $2$-cell, 
	where each component of $X$ has locally indicable  (possibly trivial) fundamental group.  
	Assume that $\partial\a$ is not freely homotopic in $X\cup E$ 
	to a path in $X$.   
	Suppose that $Q$ is an edge-path in $\mathcal{Y}$ from a $0$-cell $*_0$ to a $0$-cell $*_1$, 
	and that $H_0<\pi_1(X,*_0)$, $ H_1< \pi_1(X,*_1)$ are 
	subgroups such that $H_0=Q  H_1Q^{-1}$ in $\pi_1(\mathcal{Y},*_0)$,  
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $ H_0$ is non-cyclic; or
		\item $\partial\a$ is freely homotopic in $X\cup E$ to a proper power, and $H_0$ is non-trivial.
	\end{itemize} 
	Then $Q$ is homotopic rel endpoints in $\mathcal{Y}$ to an edge-path  $Q_0$ in $X$  
	such that $H_0=Q_0 H_1 Q_0^{-1}$ in $\pi_1(X,*_0)$.
\end{lem}

Note: the conditions imply that at least one component  of $X$ has a fundamental group 
that is non--trivial
(indeed  in the torsion-free case it contains a non--cyclic subgroup) and the conclusion implies that $*_0$ and $*_1$ are contained in the same
component of $X$.

\begin{proof}
	We  work throughout within the component of $\mathcal{Y}$ that contains $Q$, so without loss of generality we may assume that $\mathcal{Y}$ is connected. 
	
	Let  $X_{\lambda}$ ($\lambda\in\Lambda$) be the components of $X$. 
	For each $\lambda\in\Lambda$ choose a base-vertex $v_\lambda\in X_{\lambda}$ and a spanning tree $T_\lambda$ in
	 $X_{\lambda}$.   
	 The forest $\cup_\lambda T_\lambda$ contains all the $0$-cells of $\mathcal{Y}$, so can be extended to a spanning tree $T$ for $\mathcal{Y}$ by adding a subset of  $E$.
	
	Let $P_\lambda$ ($\lambda\in\Lambda$) and $P_\a$ denote respectively the unique geodesics in $T$ from $*_0$ to $v_\lambda$ and from $*_0$ to the initial point of $\partial\a$. Then $\pi_1(\mathcal{Y},*_0)$ is the one-relator product 
	$$\frac{\left(\ast_\lambda G_\lambda\right)*F}{\<\<R\>\>}$$
	of the locally indicable groups $G_\lambda:=P_\lambda\cdot\pi_1(X,v_\lambda)\cdot P_\lambda^{-1}$ and the free group $F$ on $E\setminus E(T)$, where $R$ is the group element represented by $P_\a\cdot\partial\a\cdot P_\a^{-1}$.
	
	Let $\lambda(0),\lambda(1)\in\Lambda$ denote the indices such that $*_j\in X_{\lambda(j)}$ for $j=0,1$.
	Since $P_{\lambda(0)}$ is contained in $X_{\lambda(0)}$ it follows that $G_{\lambda(0)}=\pi_1(X,*_0)$.
	Similarly, if $P_*$ is the geodesic in $T_{\lambda(1)}$ from $*_1$ to $v_{\lambda(1)}$, then 
	$$\pi_1(X,*_1)=P_*\cdot\pi_1(X,v_{\lambda(1)})\cdot P_*^{-1}=P_*\cdot P_{\lambda(1)}^{-1}\cdot G_{\lambda(1)}\cdot P_{\lambda(1)}\cdot P_*^{-1}.$$
	
	Since $H_0<\pi_1(X,*_0)$ and $H_1<\pi_1(X,*_1)$ are non-cyclic   -- or, in the torsion case, non-trivial --
	it follows that the intersection of $G_{\lambda(0)}$ and $gG_{\lambda(1)}g^{-1}$ 
	in   $\pi_1(\mathcal{Y},v_0)$ is non-cyclic  (resp. non-trivial), 
	where $g\in\pi_1(\mathcal{Y},*_0)$ is the group element represented by the closed edge-path $Q\cdot P_*\cdot P_{\lambda(1)}^{-1}$.
	By Brodsky's original version from \cite{B81}, Theorem \ref{BrodskyLemma} 
	(resp. the torsion version from \cite{HS}, Theorem \ref{BrodskyTorsion}),
	it follows that $\lambda(1)=\lambda(0)$ and $g\in G_{\lambda(0)}$.  
	It follows that $P_*$ and $P_{\lambda(1)}$ are paths in $T_{\lambda(0)}\subset X$; 
	and that $Q\cdot P_*\cdot P_{\lambda(1)}^{-1}$ is 
	homotopic rel basepoint in $\mathcal{Y}$ to a path $P'$ in $X$ representing $g$.  Hence $Q$ is homotopic rel endpoints in $\mathcal{Y}$ to the path $Q_0:=P'\cdot P_{\lambda(1)}\cdot P_*^{-1}$ in $X$.   
	Finally, by the Freiheitssatz,  Theorem \ref{Freiheitssatz}, 
	$H_0=Q_0 H_1Q_0^{-1}$ in $\pi_1(X,*_0)$ as required.
\end{proof}


\subsection{Stallings graphs} 
For the proof of Theorem \ref{main} 
we are going to examine rank $2$ 
free subgroups $K<\pi_1(X\cup\cS,v_0)$ and $L<\pi_1(X\cup\cT,v_1)$ that are conjugate in $G$.

Recall from the Reformulation in \S \ref{refandreds} 
 that the boundary of the added 2--cell $\alpha$ is attached along  a path 
$R=Z^m$ and $Z=u_1x_1u_2x_2\dots u_kx_k$ where each $u_i$ is $e^{\pm1}$ for some edge $e\in\cS\cup\cT$, 
and each $x_i$ is an edge-path   of length $0$ or $1$
in (some component of) $X$.


Then any basis for $K$ can be expressed as a pair of based, reduced closed paths   $\{U_1,U_2\}$ in ${X}^{(1)}\cup\cS$. This gives two maps of circles into $X\cup\cS$, which can be decomposed into
1-complexes with edges labelled by  the images in $X^{(1)}\cup \cS$, and base-vertices mapping to $v_0$.
Identify base-vertices as $*$ and fold edges with the same image to make the map an immersion.
The resulting labelled graph we shall call the Stallings graph $St(U_1,U_2)$ (or $St(K)$), and the immersion $\iota_K:(St(U_1,U_2),*) \to (X\cup\cS,v_0) \subset (Y,v_0)$.
We shall suppose that the Stallings graphs considered here are more than strongly reduced: 
if the image of a   non--empty reduced path  in $St(U_1,U_2)$   is a closed path in $X^{(1)}$ 
then this loop is not nullhomotopic in $X$.  
(If  a path contradicting this property exists, we can identify its endpoints and then remove one of its edges, 
to obtain a smaller graph with different $U_1, U_2$, but generating the same subgroup. 
Also remove free edges that do not contain the base point.
After finitely many such moves the required property will be satisfied.)

Similarly there is an immersion $\iota_L:(St(V_1,V_2),*') \to (X\cup\cT,v_1)\subset (Y,v_1)$.

This is  a slight generalisation of a construction of Stallings \cite{St},
where he showed 
that every finitely-generated subgroup $H$ of a free group $F$
on a given basis $\mathcal{Y}$
can be realised by an immersion of a graph to the rose with petals labelled by the elements of 
$\mathcal{Y}$.  


Recall that a finite 
connected graph is a {\em core graph} if it has no vertices of degree $1$. 
Every finite connected graph $\G$ has a unique core subgraph. 
Stallings graphs are not in general core graphs.  
However, if $St(U_1,U_2)$ is not a core graph, then the only vertex of degree $1$ in $St(U_1,U_2)$ 
is the base-point $*$;  
let $\g$ in $St(K)$ be the path from its base point to a vertex in the core. 
   Then $Q_0:=\iota_K(\g)$ is  a path in $X^{(1)}\cup\cS$ from $v_0$ to a vertex $v'_0$.  Replace $St(K)$ by its core and $Q$ by $Q_0^{-1}Q$ in the theorem.  
   Similarly $V_1,V_2$ give a Stallings graph $St(L)$ which we may assume is core, 
   and an immersion $\iota_L:St(L)\to Y$ based at $v_1$.
   Thus up to replacing $Q$ by a path  $Q_0^{-1}QQ_1$ with $Q_0$ in $X\cup \cS$ and $Q_1$ in $X\cup\cT$,
   we can assume that the Stallings graphs are core.




\subsection{Orderings}\label{ords}

Recall from  \S \ref{refandreds} that $Y=X\cup\cS\cup\cT\cup\alpha$, where
the closed path  $R$  identified with $\partial\alpha$ can be written  $R=Z^m=(u_1x_1u_2x_2\dots u_{k}x_k)^m$,
and $Z$ is a cyclically reduced loop at $*$,   not a proper power in   $\pi_1(X\cup\cS\cup\cT)$  and not contained in $X$.
Then $\ol{G}:=\pi_1(X\cup\cS\cup\cT\cup\alpha',*)$ where $\alpha'$ is a 2-cell attached along the loop $Z$,
is locally indicable (Theorem \ref{Gli}), and hence right orderable (Theorem \ref{lilo}).   
 Choose a right ordering $<$ on $\ol{G}$.

\smallskip
For each $u\in\cS\cup\cT$, choose a path $\tau(u)$ in $Y^{(1)}$ 
from the initial point of $u$ to the base point $*$ of $Y$.
(For instance choose a maximal tree in $Y^{(1)}$ and a path therein.)
For each $j=1,\dots k$, define $z(j) = u_1x_1\dots x_{j-1}$ and $\tau_j=\tau(u_j)$ if
$u_j\in\cS\cup\cT$, and $z(j) = u_1x_1\dots x_ju_j$ and   $\tau_j=\tau(u_j^{-1})$ if $u_j\in\cS^{-1}\cup\cT^{-1}$.
The path $z(j)\tau_j$ is  a closed path in $Y$ based at $*$ : let $g_j\in\pi_1(Y,*)$
be the corresponding group element.
For each $u\in \cS\cup\cT$ consider the occurrences of $u^{\pm1}$ in $Z$ :  
let $Ind(Z,u)=\{j \mid  u_j =u^{\pm1}\}$.
Thus if $i,j\in Ind(Z,u)$  
then $\tau_i=\tau_j$ and $ z(j)\tau_j(z(i)\tau_i)^{-1}$ reduces to $z(j)z(i)^{-1}$,
a loop in $Y$ based at  $*$, and the corresponding group element is $g_jg_i^{-1}$.
The occurrence $u_{max}$ is at $j\in Ind(Z,u)$ when $g_j\ge g_i$ for all $i\in Ind(Z,u)$.
The occurrence is unique by Weinbaum's Theorem \ref{Weinbaum} as $g_j=g_{j'}$ with $j,j'\in Ind(Z,u)$
implies that a subword of $Z$ corresponding to  $g_j^{-1}g_{j'}$ is trivial.
Similarly there is a unique occurrence $u_{min}$ of each $u\in\cS\cup\cT$, with the obvious meaning.   
Note that each of $u_{max},u_{min}$ is repeated precisely $m$ times in $R=Z^m$.

Observe that in a picture over $Y$, if the $u_{max}$ arc of one $\alpha$ disc arrives as a $u_{max}$ arc on 
another $\alpha$ disc, then the two discs cancel.   
An analogous remark holds for the $u_{min}$ arc.


The right ordering on $\ol G$  induces a pre-ordering on $\a$-cells 
in any simply connected relative  picture $\mathcal P$ over $Y$: 
$\b_1\le\b_2$ if some (and hence any) path in the picture  
from the base-point of $\b_1$ to that of $\b_2$,  is $\ge 1$ in $\ol{G}$.
Note that if a $u_{max}$  arc of the $\a$-cell $\beta_1$ has its other endpoint on the
$\a$-cell $\beta_2$ as $u_i$, then  $\beta_1 \le \beta_2$:
there is a path $z(j)z(i)^{-1}$ with $u_j$ the occurrence of $u_{max}$, 
from the base point of $\beta_1$ to the base point of $\beta_2$, and 
$g_{j} g_i^{-1} \ge 1 \iff g_j \ge  g_i$, which is the case at $u_{max}$.


 
When we speak of minimal or maximal cells in a picture, we mean with respect to this pre-order.   
A cell is {\em locally} minimal (resp. maximal) if it is strictly less than 
(resp. strictly greater than) each of its neighbours.

\smallskip
	The following lemma will be used in the proofs  of   our main results.

\begin{lem}\label{l:1}
	Let $\G$ be a reduced relative  simply connected picture 
	with more than one   $\a$-disc 
	over $Y = X\cup \cS\cup\cT\cup\alpha$. 
	Then there are two  $\a$-discs 
	$\b_1,\b_2$ in $\G$, each of which   is joined to the boundary  (only) 
	by a sequence of consecutive arcs 
	which contains 
	either all of its $u_{min}$   arcs   for every $u\in\cS\cup\cT$  
	or all of its $u_{max}$  arcs for every $u\in\cS\cup\cT$.  
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
	Let $\b,\b'$ be a minimal and a maximal $\a$-disc 
	respectively in $\G$.  
	If $\b,\b'$ satisfy the conclusion in the statement then we are done.  
	Otherwise at least one of them -- say $\b$ -- fails.   
	Since $\b$ is minimal it is locally minimal, 
	and since $\G$ is reduced all of the $s_{min}$ and $t_{min}$ arcs of $\b$ end on $\partial\G$,
	for all $s\in\cS, t\in\cT$.   
	Thus 
	the sequence of arcs from $\b$ to the boundary is not consecutive, 
	and so  
		$\b$, together with its $s_{min},t_{min}$ arcs, divides $\G$ into at least two smaller  pictures
	(see Figure \ref{f2}).
	 
	% Figure environment removed
	
	
	We have $\G=\G_1\cup\G_2$ with $\b\subset\G_1\cap\G_2$, where each of $\G_i$ has  fewer $\a$-discs than $\G$.  
	Inductively, we may assume that the result applies to each $\G_i$: 
	so $\G_i$ has an $\a$-disc  
	$\b_i\ne\b$ satisfying the conclusion of the Lemma.  
	Then the pair $\{\b_1,\b_2\}$ will do.
\end{proof}


\section{The Torsion Case}\label{torsion}

In this section we prove Theorem \ref{maintorsion} in the form set out in Theorem \ref{2ComplexVersion}. 


\subsection*{Proof of Theorem \ref{2ComplexVersion} when $R$ is a proper power }



	Let $Y=X\cup\cS\cup\cT\cup \alpha$ be as in the statement of the theorem,
where the boundary of $\alpha$ is identified with the loop $R=Z^m$ in $Y^{(1)}$ and $m\ge 2$.
We show that if there are loops $U$ based at $v_0$ in $X\cup\cS$ and 
$V$ based at $v_1$ in $X\cup\cT$,
not nullhomotopic in $Y$, 
and a path $Q$ such that $U$ is homotopic to $QVQ^{-1}$ in $Y$,
then $Q$ is homotopic rel endpoints in $Y$ to a path $Q_1Q_2$ with $Q_1$ in $X\cup\cS$ and
$Q_2$ in $X\cup\cT$.

\smallskip
Let $\G^{rect}$ be a reduced rectangular relative picture representing 
a homotopy between $U$ and  $QVQ^{-1}$.  
Thus $\G^{rect}$ has both side labels $Q$, top label $U$ and bottom label $V$.   
Form an annular picture $\G^{ann}$ by identifying the two vertical sides of $\G^{rect}$ and then performing $\a$-cell cancellations and boundary surgery to ensure that $\G^{ann}$ is reduced and its top and bottom boundary labels are strongly cyclically reduced.

Now choose a path $\g$ between the two boundary components of the annulus that meets $\G^{ann}$ transversely and minimally.
In other words, $\g$ meets none of the $\a$-discs of $G^{ann}$, and intersects the union of the $(\cS\cup\cT)$-arcs transversely in the fewest possible points.  
If $Q'$ is the path in $Y^{(1)}$ labelling $\g$, then there are paths $P_\cS,P_\cT$ in $X\cup\cS$ 
and $X\cup\cT$ respectively such that $Q'$ is homotopic rel endpoints to $P_\cS\cdot Q\cdot P_\cT$.  
 Hence we may assume that $Q=Q'$ and that $\G^{rect}$ can be recovered from $\G^{ann}$ by cutting the annulus along $\g$.

Note first that we may assume that there are arcs in $\G^{ann}$ 
going to each of the two boundary components of the annulus: if for example there are no arcs meeting the top boundary, then $Q$ is homotopic to a path in $X\cup\cT$ by Theorem \ref{Br}, since $U$ is not nullhomotopic in $X\cup\cS$.  
 Recall that the closed path $Z$ traverses an edge of $\cS\cup\cT$ precisely $k$ times, 
 so that each $\a$-disc in a picture is incident to  precisely $mk$ $(\cS\cup\cT)$-arcs.   
 For any integer $N>1$, the rectangular picture
$$N.\G^{rect}:=\G^{rect}+\cdots+\G^{rect}~~(N~\mathrm{terms}),$$
representing 
a homotopy between $U^N$ and  $QV^NQ^{-1}$, is reduced and has at least $N$ arcs going to each of the top and bottom boundaries.   Replacing $U$, $V$ and $\G^{rect}$ by $U^N$, $V^N$ and $N.\G^{rect}$ for sufficiently large $N$ (for example, $N>2mk$), it follows that $\G^{rect}$ has more than one $\a$-disc, and that each boundary component of the annulus meets arcs that go to neither of the $\a$-discs $\b_1,\b_2$ given by Lemma \ref{l:1}.   We use this fact to obtain a contradiction as follows.

For a chosen right ordering on $\ol{G}:=\pi_1(X\cup\cS\cup\cT)/\<\<Z\>\>$, 
there is a sequence of consecutive arcs from $\b_1$ to the boundary that contains either all its $u_{min}$ arcs for all $u\in\cS\cup\cT$, or all its $u_{max}$  arcs for all $u\in\cS\cup\cT$.  Assume the latter.   This sequence of arcs at $\b_1$ cannot contain all the top boundary arcs of $\G^{rect}$, nor all its bottom boundary arcs.  Hence it cannot contain arcs going to both the left and right sides.  Without loss of generality, assume that none of these arcs go to the right side.  

The sequence of arcs spans a cyclic subpath of $\partial\a=Z^m$ of syllable length at least $(m-1)SL(Z)+2$.  Moreover any subsequence going to the top (resp. bottom) boundary spans a subpath of a single $\cS$-syllable (resp. $\cT$-syllable) of $Z$.  Thus the subsequence of consecutive arcs going from $\b_1$ to the left side of $\G^{rect}$ spans a full $(m-1)SL(Z)$ syllables of $R$, and hence contains at least $(m-1)k$ arcs.   Now let $\g'$ denote the left side of the sub-picture obtained by removing $\b_1$ and its incident boundary arcs from $\G^{rect}$.   Then $\g'$ is a path between the two boundary components of $\G^{ann}$.  We claim that it has smaller transverse intersection with $\G^{ann}$ than $\g$, giving the required contradiction.

To see this, note that in replacing $\g$ by $\g'$, we replace the  transverse intersections of $\g$ with arcs going to the left side of $\G^{rect}$ (of which there are at least $(m-1)k$) by transverse intersections of $\g'$ with arcs from $\b_1$ that do not belong to the consecutive sequence going to the boundary of $\G^{rect}$ (of which there are at most $k-|\cS\cup\cT|$).  This proves the claim, and hence the result.
\hfill $\square$



\section{Plan of the proof of Theorem \ref{main}, and first steps} \label{plan} 

Recall from the Reformulation in \S \ref{prelims} that we have   a 2-complex of the form
$Y := X \cup\cS \cup\cT \cup\a$ where each component of $X$ has locally indicable fundamental group, 
$\cS$ and $\cT$ are two disjoint, non-empty sets of $1$-cells, 
and $\a$ is a $2$-cell attached along a strongly cyclically reduced closed path $R$ containing all the $1$-cells on $\cS\cup\cT$.  From now on we assume that we are in the torsion-free case, in which $R$ does not represent a proper power in $\pi_1(X\cup\cS\cup\cT)$ (so $G=\ol G$).



We define the complexity of $Y$ to be $c(Y ) := k - \vert\pi_0(X)\vert$, where
$\pi_0(X)$ means the set of components of $X$.

We say that $Y$ satisfies the Collins property if 
there exists no non-trivial $(Y,Q)$-CCE.
Theorem \ref{main} (that is, the torsion-free part of Theorem \ref{2ComplexVersion}) can be reformulated then as:  
\begin{thm}  All 2--complexes  $Y$  as above satisfy the Collins property.
\end{thm}

We shall prove that there exists no non-trivial $(Y,Q)$-CCE.
The proof is by induction on $c(Y)$, and breaks down into several cases. 
Suppose that there is a $(Y,Q)$-CCE with $Y$ of smallest complexity, 
and for this $Y$, $Q$ is a shortest (w.r.t. $\cS\cup\cT$ length) path giving a $(Y,Q)$-CCE. 
The aim is to factor
nullhomotopies through a space of smaller complexity in order to apply
the inductive hypothesis. 
This space will be contained in a $\Z$-cover,
corresponding to some epimorphism onto $\Z$. 
In order to ensure the
existence of a suitable epimorphism – and hence $\Z$-cover, we  make
 adjustments to the complex $Y$. 
In order to justify these, we need the following result.

  Suppose that the complex $Y$ admits a non--trivial CCE.  
For each component $X_i$ of $X$ let $\Theta_i$ be the (not necessarily connected) subgraph  
$\partial \alpha \cap X_i^{(1)}$ of $X_i^{(1)}$, and let $\Theta=\cup \Theta_i$.
Recall that $R=u_1x_1u_2\dots x_k$ with $u_i\in (\cS\cup\cT)^{\pm 1}$ 
and $x_i$  a vertex or single edge in some component of $X$.


\begin{lem}\label{Agenerates}
	Let $Q$ be a shortest (w.r.t. $\cS\cup\cT$ length) path in $Y$ 
	so that there is a non--trivial $(Y,Q)$-CCE.
	Then there is a non--trivial $(Y,Q)$-CCE  $(U_1,U_2,V_1,V_2)$ and reduced rectangular relative pictures $P_i$
	for the null--homotopies $U_i=QV_iQ^{-1}$ such that the paths $Q,U_1,U_2,V_1,V_2$ all lie in
	$ \Theta \cup \cS\cup\cT$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
	First note that we can assume that $Q$ begins with a $\cT$ edge and ends with an $\cS$ edge,
	and that the $U_i$ (resp. $V_i$) are reduced and have the smallest number of $\cS$ 
	(resp. $\cT$) edges in their homotopy classes.
	
	
	Write $Q=t^{\epsilon_1}a_1u_1a_2u_2\dots a_\ell s^{\epsilon_2}$ where
	$u_i\in (\cS\cup\cT)^{\pm 1}$, $\epsilon_i=\pm 1$ and
	each $a_i$ is in some component $X_{i'}$ of $X$.
	If $a_i$ is homotopic rel to its endpoints into $\Theta_{i'}$ suppose that it is indeed in $\Theta_{i'}$.
	Let $j$ be the smallest index such that  $a_j$ is in some $X_{j'}$ but not homotopic rel its endpoints into $\Theta_{j'}$.
	Consider the picture $P_1$, and the subpath $a_j$ on the left hand vertical side. 
	Then $P_1$ has at least two components,  
	one containing the arc corresponding to $u_j$ above $a_j$, 
	and one containing the arc corresponding to $u_{j+1}$ below $a_j$.
	Then there is a   properly embedded curve $\d$ in the rectangle, starting in $a_j$ on the left hand side, 
	disjoint from $\P_1$ and separating $\P_1$, 
	and   $\d\subset X_{j'}$.  
	Indeed $\d$ follows parallel to $\cS,\cT$ arcs and segments of $\partial \alpha$ between
	endpoints of $\cS,\cT$ arcs, and so can be taken to be a path in $\Theta_{j'}$.
	
	If the other end of $\d$ lies on:
	
	the top or bottom boundary then $Q$ can be shortened;
	
	the same left hand side then  $Q$ can also be shortened;
	
	the right hand side, then after considering the possibilities
	for the analogous situation for $a_j$ on the right hand side, we see that the other end of
	$\d$ lies in the corresponding $a_j$ edge on the right hand side.
	

	
	The same situation occurs in $P_2$, and so we see that the path $Q' = t^{\epsilon_1}a_1u_1a_2u_2\dots a_{j-1}u_{j-1}$
	conjugates each loop $U_i$ to a loop in $X_{j'}\subset X$, 
	and applying Lemma \ref{Br} (there are no $\cT$ edges in the top and bottom of these subpictures)  
	$Q'$ is homotopic rel endpoints into $X\cup\cS$ and 
	again we have contradicted the minimality of $Q$.
	
	It remains to show that $U_i$ and $V_i$ lie in $\Theta$ (after homotopies).
 	
	Write $U_1= b_1s_1b_2s_2\dots b_m$ where $s_i\in\cS^{\pm1}$ and $b_i$ lie in $X$.
	Let $j$ be the smallest index such that there is no homotopy rel endpoints taking $b_j$ into $\Theta$.
	As before there is an embedded arc $\d$  starting in $b_j$ on the top, 
	disjoint from $\P_1$ and separating $\P_1$, 
	which is in  some  $X_{j'}$ of $X$.  

	If the other end of $\d$ is:
	
	on the top then $U_1$ can be shortened (to have fewer $\cS$ edges);
	
	on a vertical side then $Q$ can be shortened as before;
	
	on the bottom then $Q$ can be shortened --- to have no $\cS\cup\cT$ edges.
	
	All these cases lead to a contradiction, so all subpaths $b_i$ are homotopic rel endpoints into $\Theta$. 
	
	The analogous argument for $U_2,V_1,V_2$ completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\smallskip 
	Suppose that for the  component $X_1$ of $X$,  
	the graph  $\Theta_1=X_1 \cap \partial \alpha$ is not connected: 
	write  $\Theta_1=\Theta_{1,1} \cup \dots\cup\Theta_{1,\ell}$.
	
	
	For each component $\Theta_{1,i}$,  let $X_{1,i}$ be a copy of $X_1$. 
	
	Now construct $Y(1) = (X\setminus X_1) \cup (\cup_{i=1}^\ell X_{1,i}) \cup\cS\cup\cT \cup\alpha$,
	where  each edge $u\in\cS\cup\cT$ is added as follows: 
	if, in $Y$, an endpoint of $u$ is in $\Theta_{1,i}$ then that endpoint of $u$ in $Y(1)$ 
	is identified with the corresponding
	vertex in $\Theta_{1,i} \subset X_{1,i}$.
	The disc $\alpha$ can now be added as its boundary is identified with a path in $(\cup_{i=1}^\ell X_{1,i}) \cup\cS\cup\cT$. 
	
	It follows from Lemma \ref{Agenerates} that the pictures $P_1,P_2$ lift to $Y(1)$ 
	and so we have constructed a $(Y(1),Q)$-CCE where $Y(1)$ 
	has smaller complexity than $Y$, contradicting the minimality of $Y$.
	
	Conclusion: in a $(Y,Q)$-CCE with $Y$ of minimal complexity and $Q$ shortest, 
	each   graph $\Theta_j$ is connected.	



When $\Theta_j$ is connected, define $A_j$ to be image  
$\iota_*(\pi_1(\Theta_j,v_j))$ in $\pi_1(X_j,v_j)$  for some vertex $v_j\in \Theta_j$ 
($\iota:(\Theta_j,v_j) \hookrightarrow (X_j,v_j)$ is the inclusion map).
Let $\wh X_j$ be the $A_j$ cover of $X_j$, and $Y_j=  ( X\setminus X_j) \cup \wh {X_j} \cup \cS\cup\cT\cup\alpha$
 (identifying $\Theta_j\subset\partial\a$ with a lift of $\Theta_j\subset X_j$ to $\wh{X}_j$ and adjoining the
 $\cS\cup\cT$ edges as in $Y$).
 
Note that the complexity of $Y_j$ is the same as that of $Y$.


\begin{cor} \label{AgeneratesCor}
	If $Q$ is a shortest path giving a non--trivial $(Y,Q)$-CCE, and $\Theta_j$ is connected, then 
	the pictures $P_1,P_2$ over $Y$ lift to $Y_j$ to give a non--trivial $(Y_j,Q)$-CCE.
\end{cor}  





\smallskip
 
	\noindent\underline{Adjustment $\Theta$ :}
When $\Theta_j$ is connected, we replace each $X_i$ by its $A_i$ cover 
where $A_i= \iota_*(\pi_1(\Theta_i, v_i)) < \pi_1(X_i,v_i)$.
Thus $\pi_1(X_j)=A_j$ is finitely generated, by
the edges in $\Theta_i$ outside of a maximal tree.
For a $(Y,Q)$-CCE with $Y$ minimal and $Q$ shortest, 
we can now assume that this  change has been made for every component $X_i$.

Initial Case for the induction

By hypothesis, each 1-cell $u \in\cS\cup\cT$ occurs in $\partial\a$. 
Moreover, if $u$ separates $Y\setminus\a$ then it must occur at least  
once with each orientation in $\partial\a$. 
Since $Y$ is connected, it follows that the least
possible complexity is $c(Y ) = 0$, 
which is realised only when $\vert\cS\cup\cT\vert=k = \vert\pi_0 (X)\vert$,
the components of $X$ and the connecting 1-cells $\cS\cup\cT$ 
	are arranged in a cyclic manner, with each $u\in\cS\cup\cT$ appearing exactly once in $\partial\a$.
So the inductive proof starts with precisely that case.

 
As each $\cS,\cT$ edge occurs exactly once in $R$, in a reduced picture on any surface over $Y$
there are no $\cS,\cT$ edges joining $\alpha$--discs.
It follows that on a reduced annular picture, for each $\a$ disc, all $\cS$ edges go to the top boundary,
and all $\cT$ edges to the bottom boundary. 
Thus $Q=Q_1\cdot Q_2$ with  $Q_1,Q_2$ paths in $X\cup\cS$ and $X\cup\cT$ respectively,
and the Collins property holds.

\bigskip

\noindent
Inductive Step

\smallskip
For the inductive step of the proof we assume that the result holds
for $Y$--like complexes of smaller complexity.
Adjustment $\Theta$ enables us to construct a suitable $\Z$-cover $p :\wh Y\to Y$
corresponding to an epimorphism $\pi_1(Y) \to\Z$ as follows. 
In the cover  $\wh Y$ let $\wh X,\wh \cS,\wh \cT$ denote the lifts of $X,\cS,\cT$.
At
least one of the following is true:
 
\smallskip\noindent
(1) $\vert\cS\cup\cT\vert> \vert\pi_0(X)\vert$: in this case there is an epimorphism 
$\Psi:\pi_1(Y)\to \Z$ that vanishes on the fundamental group of each component of $X$
(only the homology class of the loops matter).
Hence there is a corresponding $\Z$--cover $p:\wh Y\to Y$ such that the pre-image $\wh X$ of $X$ has the form $X\times\Z$.
Let $\wh \a$ be a 2-cell in $p^{-1}(\a)$. 
We claim that $\partial\wh \a$ passes through more than $\vert\pi_0(X)\vert$
components of $\wh X$. 
If not, let $Y'\subset\wh Y$ be the subcomplex consisting of $\wh \a$, the 1--cells of $\wh\cS\cup\wh\cT$
that occur in $\partial \wh\a$, and the components of $\wh X$ 
that meet $\partial\wh \a$.
It follows that  each component of $X$
has precisely one pre-image in $Y'$, and as the restriction of
$p$ to $Y'$ is an immersion, it follows that each 1-cell in $\cS\cup\cT$
also has precisely one pre-image in $Y'$. 
It further follows that 
the immersion $p : Y' \to Y$ is a cellular isomorphism, which is
absurd.

\smallskip
\noindent
(2) There are two components $X_1,X_2$ of $X$, each of which meets
precisely one of the 1-cells of $\cS\cup\cT$. 
In this case   
$\pi_1(X_1)$ and $\pi_1(X_2)$ are non--trivial,  
finitely generated by the $x_j$ loops after adjustment $\Theta$.



Therefore there exists an epimorphism $\Psi: \pi_1(Y)\to\Z$ which
vanishes on the fundamental group of each component of $X$ except 
possibly for $X_1,X_2$ , but does not vanish on at least one of
these; without loss of generality on $\pi_1(X_1)$. 
Let $p : \wh Y \to Y$ denote the $\Z$-cover corresponding to $\Psi$.
Let $X_0$ be the component of $X$ that is joined to $X_1$ by $u$. 
Then $X_0 \neq X_2$ since $\vert\cS\cup\cT \vert>1$. 
Moreover there is a subpath of $\partial\alpha$ of the form 
$u^{-\epsilon} x_j u^\epsilon$ where   
$x_j$ is a  loop 
in $X_1$ with $\Psi(x_j)\neq 1$. It follows that any
lift of $u^{-\epsilon} x_j u^\epsilon $ to $\wh Y$ joins two distinct components of $p^{-1} (X_0 )$. 



\smallskip\noindent
(3) $\vert\cS\cup\cT\vert=\vert\pi_0(X)\vert$ and there is a component $X_1$ of $X$ that meets
only one $u \in\cS\cup\cT$ (joining $X_1$ to $X_0$ say). 
Then as before, $\pi_1(X_1)$ is not trivial.
There is also at least
one $u_0\in\cS\cup\cT$ which is non-separating in $Y \setminus\a$ (In particular, $u_0\neq u$.)
If $u_0$ appears in $\partial\a$ with exponent sum 0, then there is
a $\Z$-cover $p : \wh Y \to  Y$ such that the pre-image of $X$ has the form
$X \times \Z$ --- and we can argue as in the first case above. 
Otherwise there is an epimorphism $\Psi:\pi_1(Y)\to\Z$  which vanishes on the
fundamental group of each component of $X$ other than $X_1$ , but
not on $\pi_1(X_1)$. Then we can argue as in the second case above. 

\smallskip
\noindent (4) $\vert\cS\cup\cT\vert = \vert\pi_0(X)\vert$ and the components of $X$ form a cycle, 
each component being
connected to precisely two of the 1-cells $\cS\cup\cT$. In particular
each of these 1-cells is non-separating in $Y\setminus\a$, and they all
appear with the same exponent-sum (in absolute value) in $\partial\a$.
If the exponent-sum is zero, then there is a $\Z$-cover $p : \wh Y\to  Y$
such that $\wh X$ 
has the form $X \times \Z$, and we can
argue as in the first case. Otherwise, for each component $X_i$ of
$X$ there is at least one
subpath $u_j x_j u_{j+1}$ of $\partial\a$ such that $x_j$ is an edge or a vertex
in  $X_i$ and $u_{j+1} \neq u_j^{-1}$.

If $\pi_1(X_i)$ is trivial for every component $X_i$, then $\pi_1(X\cup\cS\cup\cT)\cong\Z$,
so $\pi_1(Y)$ has 
no non--cyclic subgroups.   
Without loss of generality suppose that $\pi_1 (X_1) \neq 1$ and that, 
 in the subpath $u_1x_1u_2$ of $R$, $u_1$ (resp $u_2$) is an edge in $\cS\cup\cT$ from $X_0$ to $X_1$ (resp $X_1$ to $X_2$).
Then 
after adjustment $\Theta$ we have that $\pi_1(X_1)$ is generated by the edges in $\Theta_1$ 
outside of a maximal tree, which in fact has at most one edge.

There is also a $\Z$-cover $p : \wh Y\to Y$
such that the pre-image of any component $X_j$ of $X$ other than
$X_1$ has the form $X_j\times\Z$, but the pre-image of $X_1$ does not. 
 Moreover, for an appropriate choice of $j$, $x_j$ 
(the generator of $A_1$ using a maximal tree in $\Theta_1$)
is a path in $X_1$ whose lifts to $\wh Y$
do not end in the same lift of $x_1$. Depending on the form of $x_j$
this means one of the following:

 


\begin{enumerate} 
	\item[$\bullet$] there is a subpath  $u_1x_j u_1^{-1}$ of $\partial\a$, any lift of which to $\wh Y$
	joins distinct components of $p^{-1} (X_0)$;
	\item[$\bullet$] there is a subpath  $u_2^{-1}x_ju_2$  of $\partial\a$, any lift of which to $\wh Y$
	joins distinct components of $p^{-1} (X_2)$;
	\item[$\bullet$]  there are subpaths   $u_1x_1 u_2$ and  $u_1x_j u_2$  of $\partial\a$; the lifts of these
	to $\wh Y$ which start at the same component of $p^{-1}(X_0)$ must end at distinct components of $p^{-1} (X_2)$; 
	\item[$\bullet$]  there are subpaths $u_1x_1 u_2$ of $\partial\a$ and  $u_1x_j^{-1} u_2$  of $(\partial\a)^{-1}$; the
	lifts of these to $\wh Y$ which start at the same component of
	$p^{-1}(X_0)$ must end at distinct components of $p^{-1}(X_2 )$. 
\end{enumerate}


In all four cases, any lift of $\partial\a$ to the cover $\wh Y$ meets strictly more
than $\vert\pi_0(X)\vert$ components of $p^{-1}(X)$.

\bigskip 
We now return to use the above observations to a $(Y,Q)$-CCE, say $(U_1,U_2,V_1,V_2)$,
where $U_1,U_2$ represent elements of $\pi_1(Y,v_0)$ lying in $\ker\Psi$.
If we can lift the pictures to $\wh Y$ in such a way that 
the lifted pictures involve only one lift of $\alpha$, 
then there is a $(\wh Y, \wh Q)$-CCE  in $\wh Y$ with smaller complexity, and so the Collins 
property will hold by induction. 

 

\section{First case}\label{first}

In this section we deal with the following situation: 

There is a lift $\a_m$ of the $\alpha$ disc  in $\wh Y$ such that 
	all lifts of $\cS$ edges in the lift of the Stallings graph $\wh\iota_K(St(U_1,U_2))$
lie in $\partial\a_m$. 

\smallskip

We shall use the following result  
in $\wh Y$.  

\begin{lem}[Iterated Brodsky Theorem]\label{itBr} 
	Let $\mathcal Y$ be the ascending union of a sequence (finite or infinite) of $2$-complexes $$Y_0\subset Y_1 \subset\cdots,$$ where each component of $Y_0$ has locally indicable  
(possibly trivial) fundamental group, and $$Y_{n+1}=Y_n\cup E_n\cup\a_n$$ 
	for some non-empty set $E_n$ of $1$-cells and $\a_n$ a $2$-cell.  
	Assume that $\partial\a_n$ is not freely homotopic in $Y_n\cup E_n$ to a proper power, nor to a path in $Y_n$.   
	Suppose that $Q$ is an edge-path in $\mathcal Y$ from a $0$-cell $v_0$ to a $0$-cell $v_1$, 
	and that $H_0<\pi_1(Y_0,v_0)$, 
	$H_1< \pi_1(Y_0,v_1)$ are non-cyclic subgroups such that $H_0=Q_0 H_1 Q_0^{-1}$ in $\pi_1(\mathcal Y,v_0)$. 
	
	Then $Q$ is homotopic rel endpoints in $\mathcal Y$ to an edge-path $Q_0$ in $Y_0$
	 such that $H_0=Q_0 H_1 Q_0^{-1}$ in $\pi_1(Y_0,v_0)$.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
	By induction on $n$ using the Freiheitssatz, Theorem \ref{Freiheitssatz}, 
	and Theorem \ref{Gli}, each component of each $Y_n$ has locally indicable  (possibly trivial) fundamental group, 
	and each map $Y_n\hookrightarrow Y_{n+1}$ is $\pi_1$-injective.  
	So $\pi_1(\mathcal Y,v_0)$ is the ascending union of the $\pi_1(Y_n,v_0)$.  
	Moreover, $Q$ is a path in $Y_n$ for some $n$.  
	By the Freiheitssatz again, $H_0=Q H_1 Q^{-1}$ in $\pi_1(Y_n,v_0)$.  In particular, the result holds in the case $n=0$.
	

	Now suppose that $n\ge1$. Putting $\mathcal Y:=Y_n$, $X:=Y_{n-1}$, $E:=E_n$ and $\a:=\a_n$ in Lemma \ref{Br}, it follows that $Q$ is homotopic rel end points in $Y_n$ to an edge-path in $Y_{n-1}$; the result then follows from another induction on $n$. 
\end{proof}
 


The path $Q$ in the 1--skeleton of $Y$, from the vertex $v_0$
to the vertex $v_1$,  lifts to a path $\wh Q$ in $\wh Y$ from $\wh v_0$ to a vertex $\wh v_1$. 
The  annular pictures $P_i$ for $Q^{-1}U_iQ=V_i$  over $Y$ lift to
pictures $\wh{P}_i$ over $\wh{Y}$ for $i=1,2$.


Let $Y'$ be the connected subcomplex of $\wh Y$ 
consisting of all the lifts of $\a$ and of the $1$-cells in $\cS\cup\cT$ that appear in the lifted pictures  
$\wh P_1,\wh P_2$, together with all the components of the pre-image of $X$ in $\wh{Y}$ that meet these  lifted pictures.
This contains:
\begin{enumerate}  
	
	\item[$\bullet$] the lifts $\wh\iota_K(St(K))$  and  $\wh\iota_L(St(L))$ of the Stallings graphs
	based at $\wh v_0$ and $\wh v_1$;
	
	\item[$\bullet$] the lift $\wh Q$ of $Q$ from  $\wh v_0$ to $\wh v_1$;
	
	
	\item[$\bullet$] finitely many $\Z$-covers and/or copies of the components $X_j$;
	
	\item[$\bullet$] finitely many lifts of each $\cS,\cT$ edge;
	
	\item[$\bullet$] finitely many lifts $\alpha_{m_1} , \dots ,\alpha_{m_j}, \dots,\alpha_{m_N}$ of $\alpha$.
	
\end{enumerate}

Note that the pictures $\wh P_1,\wh P_2$ over $\wh Y$ are a generalized form of relative pictures as 
they are in general relative to several 
lifts of $\alpha$.
Suppose that the  lifts $\alpha_{m_1} , \dots ,\alpha_{m_j}, \dots,\alpha_{m_N}$ of $\a$
appearing in $Y'$ are ordered by their indices.

Note that   $\alpha_0$, the lift of $\alpha$ at the base point $\wh v_0$ of $Y'$, 
which is the base point of $\wh  Y$,
may or may not appear in this list. 
We suppose that there is an index $m=m_\mu$ such that all the $\wh\cS$ edges in 
$\wh \iota_K(St(K))$ lie in the boundary of  $\alpha_{m}$. 

 
Let $Y_0\subset Y'$ be the subcomplex of all the lifts of $X$ components in $Y'$, 
all $\wh\cS$ edges in $\wh \iota_K(St(K))$ and all  $\wh \cT$ edges in $\wh\iota_L(St(L))$
together with all $\wh\cS,\wh\cT$ edges in $\partial\alpha_m$, and the 2-cell $\alpha_m$. 

We wish to apply  Theorem \ref{itBr}
with:
 
\noindent
$H_0:=(\wh\iota_K)_*(\pi_1(St(K),*_K))<\pi_1(Y_0,\wh v_0)$, \\
$H_1:=(\wh\iota_L)_*(\pi_1(St(L),*_L))<\pi_1(Y_0,\wh v_1)$, \\
where $*_K,*_L$ are the base-points of $St(K)$ and $St(L)$. 




Also, if $m'\in[m_1,m_N]$ and $m'< m$ (resp. $m'>m$) then there is at least one $\wh\cS$ edge in $\alpha_{m'}$
with index strictly less than (resp. strictly greater than) any index on a $\wh \cS$ edge in $\alpha_m$,
and so does not appear in $\wh\iota_K(St(K))$. 
Suppose that $m=m_\mu$, where $m_1,m_2,\dots,m_\mu,\dots, m_N$ are the 
indices of the lifts of $\alpha$ in $Y'$.
In order to apply   Theorem \ref{itBr},
take:

for $j=1,..,\mu-1$:


$Y_j =Y_{j-1}\cup E_j\cup \alpha_{m_{\mu-j}}$ where $E_j$ is the set of $\wh\cS,\wh\cT$ edges 
in  $\alpha_{m_{\mu-j}}$ not already present in $Y_{j-1}$; 

$Y_{\mu-1} = Y_{\mu-2}\cup E_{\mu-1}\cup\alpha_{m_1}$ 
where $E_{\mu-1}$ is the set of $\wh\cS,\wh\cT$ edges in $\alpha_{m_1}$
not already present in $Y_{\mu-2}$; this contains $\alpha_{m_1},\dots,\alpha_{m_\mu}$;

$Y_{\mu} =Y_{\mu-1} \cup E_{\mu} \cup \alpha_{m_{\mu+1}}$ where $E_{\mu}$
is the set of $\wh\cS,\wh\cT$ edges in $\alpha_{m_{\mu+1}}$ not already present in $Y_{\mu-1}$

$\vdots$

$Y_{N-1}= Y_{N-2} \cup E_{N-1} \cup \alpha_{m_N}$ where $E_{N-1}$
is the set of $\wh\cS,\wh\cT$ edges in $\alpha_{m_N}$ not already present in $Y_{N-2}$;
thus $Y_{N-1}=Y'$.

At each stage, $\wh\cS$ and $\wh\cT$ edges are added, and the
choice of $m_\mu$ ensures that every time the set of $\wh\cS$ edges added is non--empty.

\smallskip 
Applying Theorem \ref{itBr} gives the conclusion that in $Y_0$, 
the path  $\wh Q$ is homotopic rel. endpoints
to a path $\wh Q_0$  such that   $H_0=\wh Q_0H_1\wh Q_0$ in $\pi_1(Y_0,\wh v_0)$.
But $Y_0$ contains just one lift of $\alpha$, and thus the  Collins property holds
in $Y_0$ by induction on complexity. This implies that $\wh Q_0 =\wh Q_1\cdot \wh Q_2$,
which is homotopic rel. endpoints to $\wh Q$, 
in $Y_0$ with $\wh Q_1$ in 
$\wh X\cup\wh \cS$ and $\wh Q_2$ in $\wh X\cup\wh\cT$,  
and thus in $Y$ there is a homotopy between $Q$ and a concatenation $Q=Q_1\cdot Q_2$
with $Q_1$ a path in $X\cup\cS$ and $Q_2$ a path in $X\cup\cT$,
and the Collins property holds in $Y$.
 
\section{Restricting the conjugating element}\label{restrict}
\
Recall from \S\ref{plan} that $p:\wh{Y}\to Y$ is a regular covering  
with covering transformation group $\Z$, and that the immersions $\iota_K:St(K)\to Y$, $\iota_L:St(L)\to Y$ lift to immersions $\wh\iota_K:St(K)\to \wh Y$, $\wh\iota_L:St(L)\to\wh Y$ respectively.  
For the proof of Theorem \ref{2ComplexVersion}, we are reduced to the case in which $R$ is not  proper power, 
and there is no $\a$-cell in $\wh Y$ whose boundary contains all the $\wh\cS$-cells in $\wh\iota(St(K))$.
 
 In \S \ref{ords} we described how to use a right-ordering on $G:=\pi_1(Y)$ to identify 
 arcs $u_{min}$ and $u_{max}$ incident at any $\a$-disc in a picture, and to define a pre-order on the $\a$-discs in a rectangular picture.  For this purpose we choose a right ordering  $<$ that 
 is {\em dominated} by the natural ordering of $\Z$ via $\Psi:\pi_1(Y)\onto\Z$, in the sense that $\Psi(g)<\Psi(h)\Rightarrow g<h$, and fix that choice from now on   (except that at certain points we will also consider the opposite ordering $>$).   
 This choice of right ordering has some useful consequences, as follows. 
 
 \begin{itemize}
 	\item If $\a_m$ is one of the lifts of $\a$ to $\wh Y$, $u\in\cS\cup\cT$, and $n,N$ are the least and greatest integers $j$  such that $u_j$ is involved in $\a_m$, then the $u_{min}$ and $u_{max}$ arcs 
 	 of $\partial\a$ lift to $u_n,u_N$ arcs respectively of $\partial\a_m$.
 	\item  If $\b_1,\b_2$ are $\a$-discs in a rectangular picture $P$, 
 	$\wh P$ is a lift of $P$ to $\wh Y$ such that $\b_1,\b_2$ lift respectively to an $\a_m$-disc and an $\a_n$-disc in $\wh P$, 
 	with $m<n$, then $\b_1<\b_2$ in the pre-order on $\a$-discs of $P$.
 \end{itemize}
 

 
  
 \medskip\noindent{\bf Definition}:  Let $P$ be a reduced rectangular or annular picture.  
 An $\a$ disc  $\beta$ in $P$ is called an {\em up-down connection} 
 if there are $(\cS\cup\cT)$-arcs connecting it to each of the top and bottom boundaries (of the rectangle or annulus).  
 It is a {\em  $G$-min  (resp.  $G$-max) up-down connection} 
 if for each $s \in \cS$, the  $s_{min}$  (resp. $s_{max}$) arc of $\b$ ends on the top boundary of $P$,
 and for each $t \in \cT$, the  $t_{min}$ (resp.   $t_{max}$)  arc of $\b$ ends on the bottom boundary of $P$.
 

 If a  $G$-min  (resp.  $G$-max) up-down connection exists, then
we can excise the up-down connection in the form of a rectangular sub-picture consisting of a single $\a$-disc and its incident arcs, which we call $\G_{min}$ or $\G_{max}$.  The top label  $U_{min}$ (resp. $U_{max}$) of this picture is an $\cS$-syllable of $R^{\pm 1}$ containing   the $s_{max}$ edges (resp. $s_{min}$ edges) 
 for all $s\in \cS$, and its bottom label $V_{min}$ (resp. $V_{max}$)
 is a $\cT$-syllable of $R^{\pm 1}$ containing
  the $t_{max}$ edges (resp. $t_{min}$ edges) 
 for all $t\in \cT$.



 

 If $\G_{min}$ exists, then we denote its left side label by $W_1$ and its right side label by $W_2$, so that $W_1V_{min}W_2^{-1}U_{min}^{-1}$ is freely homotopic to $R^{\pm1}$.  The exponent depends on the choice of orientation of the up-down connection in $\G_{min}$, so that $W_1,W_2$ are interchangeable via the symmetry $R\leftrightarrow R^{-1}$.
 
 Similarly, if $\G_{max}$ exists, then its top and bottom labels are $U_{max}$ and $V_{max}$, and we denote the left and right side labels by $W_3$ and $W_4$.  Again, $W_3$ and $W_4$ are interchangeable via a change of orientation of the $\a$-disc.

 
 Note that the labels $U_{min}, U_{max}, V_{min},V_{max}$ on the top and bottom edges being syllables of $R^{\pm1}$ 
 means that the paths   $W_i$ begin with  $\cT$-edges 
 and end with $\cS$-edges and  
 the syllable lengths satisfy $SL(R) = SL(W_1) + SL(W_2) + 2 = SL(W_3) + SL(W_4) + 2$.
  


% Figure environment removed

Without loss of generality, we may assume that $W_1$ has syllable-length less than or equal to those of $W_2,W_3,W_4$:
\begin{equation}\label{W1least}
SL(W_1)\le\min\{SL(W_2),SL(W_3),SL(W_4)\}.
\end{equation} 


\begin{lem}	\label{surlepont}
Let $\P$ be a reduced annular relative picture over $\wh Y$, 
such that the $\a$-discs of $\P$ that are joined by $\cS$-arcs 
to the top boundary have two or more distinct $\Z$-labels.  
Then $\P$ has at least one   $G$-max and at least one   $G$-min up-down connection.
\end{lem}

\begin{proof}
	Suppose that $\b_0,\b_1$ are two $\a$-discs of $\P$ that are attached to the top boundary by $\cS$-arcs, and have $\Z$-labels $n_0,n_1$ respectively with $n_0<n_1$.   
	If $\b_1$ is not a $G$-max up-down connection, 
	then for some $u\in\cS\cup\cT$  its $G$-max $u$-arc connects $\b_1$ to another $\a$-disc -- say $\b_2$.    
	Iterating this process gives a  chain $\b_1<\b_2<\cdots$ of $\a$-discs in $\P$, 
	where each $\b_j$ is joined to $\b_{j+1}$ by the $G$-max $u$-arc for some $u\in\cS\cup\cT$.   
	The chain ends in a  $G$-max up-down connection, 
	or it contains a repetition -- say $\b_i=\b_j$ with $1\le i<j$. 
	In the latter case, 
	 the path $\b_i$ -- $\b_{i+1}$ -- $\cdots$ -- $\b_j=\b_i$ cannot be nullhomotopic in $\P$, 
	 else there is a simply connected subpicture containing the path and the pre-ordering in this
	 would give a strictly $G$-increasing chain of $\a$ discs which cannot be closed.  
	 Assuming, as we may, that $\b_i=\b_j$ is the first repetition in the chain, 
	 this path cuts the annulus into two smaller annuli.  
	 Then the path $\b_i$ -- $\b_{i-1}$ -- $\cdots$ -- $\b_1$ -- [top boundary] 
	 splits the upper small annulus into a disc--  $D$ say.
	
	Now repeat this argument in the other direction from $\b_0$ to construct a 
	chain $\b_0$, $\b_{-1}$, \dots with $\b_{-j}>\b_{-j-1}$ and $\b_{-j}$ joined to $\b_{-j-1}$ 
	by the $G$-min $u$-arc of $\b_{-j}$ for some $u\in\cS\cup\cT$.  
	The two chains cannot meet as the $\Z$ labels in the first are all strictly 
	greater than the $\Z$ labels in the second.
	The second chain is thus entirely contained in the disc $D$, 
	so cannot contain a repetition or an up-down connection, so continues indefinitely, 
	contradicting the fact that $\P$ has only finitely many $\a$-discs.  
	Hence the first chain $\b_1<\b_2<\cdots$ above must end in a $G$-max up-down connection.   
	For similar reasons, the second chain  $\b_{-j}>\b_{-j-1}\cdots$ must end in a  
	$G$-min up-down connection.
\end{proof}

 
\begin{rmk}\label{everyedge}
Since $St(K)$ is a  finite core graph, it contains a cyclically reduced path containing all its edges.
 Applying $\wh\iota_K$ to such a path gives a path $\wh{U}$ in $\wh{X}\cup\wh{\cS}$.
 By the results in \S \ref{first} we may assume that no $\partial\a_m$ contains all the $\wh\cS$-edges of $\wh{U}$.  Hence Lemma \ref{surlepont} applies to any reduced annular picture $P^{ann}$ with top label $\wh{U}$.
\end{rmk}


Returning to the proof of  Theorem \ref{2ComplexVersion}, 
we cut  $P^{ann}$ along a path traversing a  $G$-min  up-down connection along 
the side that contains a lift $\wh W_1$ of $W_1$ from $Y$ to $\wh Y$. This 
gives a rectangular picture  with 
vertical side-labels $\wh W_1$.
Moreover $\wh Q$ is homotopic rel. endpoints to  $\gamma \wh W_1\delta$ with $\g$ a path in $\wh{X}\cup\wh{\cS}$ and $\d$ in $\wh{X}\cup\wh{\cT}$.   
The statement of the theorem is equivalent to the same statement 
with $\wh{Q}$ replaced by $\wh W_1$, 
so we may assume that, in fact $\wh{Q}=\wh W_1$, and $\wh v_0, \wh v_1$ are its initial and final vertices
-- and indeed that the rectangular picture obtained from cutting $P^{ann}$ is the picture $P^{rect}$ that we began with.
 
Projecting back down from $\wh Y$ to $Y$, we are reduced to consideration of the intersection of $\pi_1(X\cup\cS)$ and $W_1\cdot\pi_1(X\cup\cT)\cdot W_1^{-1}$ in $\pi_1(Y)$. 

\section{The form of reduced rectangular pictures with vertical sides labelled $W_1$}\label{formW1}

We shall now show that Theorem \ref{2ComplexVersion} holds when $Q=W_1$; 
we show that reduced rectangular pictures with both vertical sides labelled $W_1$
have a certain restricted form, which will give the result.


\begin{lem}\label{l:3}
	Assume that the inequality (\ref{W1least}) holds.
	Let $\G$ be a reduced relative rectangular   picture
	over $Y$ with a single $\a$-disc, 
	such that both vertical sides of $\G$ have label $W_1$.  
	Then $\G=\pm\G_{min}$ and $W_2=W_1$.
\end{lem}

\begin{pf}
	Let $U,V$ be the labels of the top and bottom sides of $\G$ respectively, so that $\partial\G$ is labelled 
	$W_1VW_1^{-1}U^{-1}$.
	
	The cyclic subpath 
	$W_1$ of $W_1VW_1^{-1}U^{-1}$ is {\em uniquely positioned}, 
	 (in the sense that no other cyclic subpath is homotopic rel endpoints to $W_1$ in $X\cup\cS\cup\cT$)
	-- for otherwise some initial or terminal segment of $W_1$ would be 
	{homotopic rel endpoints in $X\cup\cS\cup\cT$}  
	to its own inverse.  
	The same comment applies to the {cyclic subpath} 
	$W_1^{-1}$.  It follows that the {cyclic subpath} 
	$W_1$ of $R$ matches up to either the left or the right vertical side of $\G$, 
	and hence that $\G=\pm\G_{min}$, as claimed. 
\end{pf}




\begin{lem}\label{l:2}
	Assume that the inequality (\ref{W1least}) holds.
	Let $\G$ be a reduced relative rectangular  picture 
	over $Y$ with more than one $\a$-disc, 
	such that both vertical sides of $\G$ have label $W_1$.    
 Then $\G$ can be decomposed in the form $\G_1+\Delta+\G_2$, 
	where each of $\G_1,\G_2$ is a copy of either  $\pm\G_{min}$ or of $\pm\G_{max}$. 
	Moreover the $\a$-discs $\b_1,\b_2$ of $\G$ given by Lemma \ref{l:1}
are precisely the $\a$-discs in $\G_1$ and $\G_2$.
 
\end{lem}

\begin{pf} Let $\b_1,\b_2$ be the $\a$ discs given by Lemma \ref{l:1}.
	Suppose first that no ($\cS\cup\cT$)-arc joins $\b_1$ to the right side of the picture.  Lemma \ref{l:1} gives a sequence of consecutive ($\cS\cup\cT$)-arcs from $\b_1$ to the boundary; these arcs and the parts of the boundary that separate them are labelled by a path $\g_1$ in $Y^{(1)}$ of syllable length $SL(W_1)+2$ that contains $W_1$.  It follows that all the ($\cS\cup\cT$)-arcs from the left side of the picture are joined to $\b_1$, as are at least some of the $\cS$-arcs from the top boundary and at least some of the $\cT$-arcs from the bottom boundary. 
 Moreover, either all of the $u_{min}$ arcs at $\b_1$ or all of the $u_{max}$ arcs go to the top or bottom sides of $\G$, by the inequality \eqref{W1least}.     
 Then by cutting $\G$ along the right side of $\b_1$ we can decompose $\G$ as $\G_1+\G'$ for some $\G'$, where  $\G_1$ is a copy of $\pm\G_{min}$ or $\pm\G_{max}$ and $\b_1$ is the $\a$-disc in $\G_1$. 
	 It also follows that no ($\cS\cup\cT$)-arc joins $\b_2$ to the left side. 
 Repeating the argument, we have $\G'=\Delta+\G_2$ for some $\D$, where $\G_2$ is a copy of $\pm\G_{min}$ or $\pm\G_{max}$ 
 -- and $\b_2$ is the $\a$-cell in  $\G_2$ as claimed. 
	
	Parallel arguments give the result in all cases where one of $\b_1,\b_2$ fails to be connected to one of the vertical sides by ($\cS\cup\cT$)-arcs.  So we may assume that each of $\b_1,\b_2$ is connected to each of the vertical sides.
Hence also all $\cS$-arcs from the top of the picture are connected to one of the $\b_j$, and all the $\cT$ arcs on the bottom are connected to the other.
 
	
	Let $\b_3$ be a $G$--minimal $\a$-disc in $\Gamma$ (possibly $\b_1$ or $\b_2$). 
	Its $u_{min}$ arcs do not end on other $\a$ discs for all $u\in \cS\cup\cT$.
	
	If some $s_{min}$ arc of $\b_3$ ends on the top, then $\b_3$ is one of $\b_1$, $\b_2$. 
	But then it is not possible for   any 
	 $t_{min}$ arc of $\b_3$ to end on the bottom due to the positions of $\b_1,\b_2$, and it
	cannot end on the vertical sides by the minimality of $SL(W_1)$. 
	
	Thus the $s_{min}$ arcs ($s\in\cS$) of $\b_3$ all end on one of the vertical sides, 
	and the $t_{min}$ arcs ($t\in\cT$) all end on the other vertical side.
	In this case, forming $ \Gamma +\G_{min}$ gives a picture in which the new right hand $\a$ disc
	is less than the $G$-minimal disc in $\Gamma$ and so the new picture is reduced. 
	In this picture there is no possible second disc as required by Lemma \ref{l:1}, 
giving a contradiction.		 
\end{pf}


\begin{cor}\label{W1W2}
	Assume that the inequality (\ref{W1least}) holds and that $W_1=W_2$.   
	Then  $\pi_1(X\cup\cS,v_0)\cap W_1\pi_1(X\cup\cT,v_1)W_1^{-1}$ is cyclic.
\end{cor}

\begin{proof}
	$\G_{min}$ is a reduced relative  picture 
	with vertical side  labels  $W_1$.  
	We show by induction on the number $n$ of $\a$-discs that any reduced relative  picture  
	$\D$ with $n$ $\a$-discs and vertical side  labels $W_1$ has the form $\pm n\G_{min}$ (up to boundary surgery), where  
	$$n\G_{min}:=\G_{min}+\cdots+\G_{min}~~(n~\mathrm{terms}).$$
	Thus $\pi_1(X\cup\cS,v_0)\cap W_1\pi_1(X\cup\cT,v_1)W_1^{-1}$ is generated by the top label $U_{min}$ of $\G_{min}$.
	
	If $n=1$ then the result follows from Lemma \ref{l:3}, so assume that $n>1$.  
	By Lemma \ref{l:2} we can write  $\D  = \G_1+\D'+\G_2$ 
	and as pointed out in the proof of Lemma \ref{l:3}, the {cyclic subpaths} 
	$W_1$ and $W_1^{-1}$ of $R$ are uniquely positioned, 
	from which it follows that each of $\G_1,\G_2$ is  $\pm\G_{min}$ and  
	$\G_1+\D'=\pm (n-1)\G_{min}$ by inductive hypothesis.   
	Since $\D$ is reduced, it follows that $\D=\pm n\G_{min}$, as claimed.
\end{proof}





\begin{lem}
	\label{newlemma:1} 
	Assume that inequality \eqref{W1least} holds and $W_1\neq W_2$. 
	Let $\Gamma$ be a  reduced relative annular picture over $\wh Y$ with 
	two or more $\Z$ labels on the $\a$-discs joined to the top. 
	Then   $W_3=W_1$ or $W_4=W_1$,  and any $G$-min up-down connection in $\G$ is joined 
	by all the $\wh\cS\cup\wh\cT$-arcs in its $\wh{W}_1$ side to a $G$-max up-down connection.  
	
	
\end{lem}

\begin{pf} 
	Lemma \ref{surlepont}
says there is a $G$-min up-down connection $\b$ in $\G$.
	Splitting $\G$ along the $\wh W_1$ side of this gives a reduced rectangular picture $\Gamma^{rect}$ 
	for $U'=\wh W_1V'\wh W_1^{-1}$ for 
	(strongly after strong reduction) reduced paths $U'$ in $\wh X\cup\wh\cS$ and $V'$ in $\wh X\cup\wh\cT$.
 By Lemma \ref{l:2}, this picture has the form $\wh{\G}_1 + \wh{\Gamma}'+\wh{\G}_2$ where each of 
$\wh{\G}_i$ $i=1,2$ is a lift of $\pm\G_{min}$ or of $\pm\G_{max}$. 
 Indeed by construction the $\a$-disc at the left of $\Gamma^{rect}$
 (after perhaps replacing $\Gamma^{rect}$ by $-\Gamma^{rect}$) 
  is a $G$-min up-down connection, so necessarily $\wh{\G}_1$ is a lift of $+\G_{min}$.
 We cannot have $\wh{\G}_2=\wh{\G}_1$ since $W_1\ne W_2$, and we cannot have $\wh{\G}_2=-\wh{\G}_1$ since $\Gamma$ is reduced.   Hence $\wh{\G}_2$ is a lift of $\pm\G_{max}$, and one of $W_3$ or $W_4$ is equal to $W_1$ as claimed.  
 Furthermore, since $\G$ can be recovered from $\G^{rect}$ by identification of its vertical sides, 
 the $\a$-disc in $\wh{\G}_1$ is joined in $\G$ to the $\a$-disc in $\wh{\G}_2$ 
 by all the $(\wh\cS\cup\wh\cT)$-arcs in its $\wh W_1$ side.  
 But the former is the $G$-min up-down connection under consideration, 
 and the latter is a $G$-max up-down connection. The result follows.
\end{pf}
 

 
In particular, at least one of $W_3,W_4$ also has least syllable length among the $W_j$. 
Applying Lemma \ref{W1W2} again with respect to the opposite right order $>$ on $G$, 
we may also assume that $W_3\ne W_4$.  Without loss of generality
 (replacing $\G_{max}$ by $-\G_{max}$ if necessary)  we may assume that $W_4=W_1$.   
 Finally, as noted in the proof of Lemma \ref{newlemma:1}, $\G_{max}\ne\pm\G_{min}$.  
 We may summarize all these working hypotheses as follows:
\begin{equation}\label{W1leastplus}
	SL(W_1)\le\min\{SL(W_i)\}\, ,\\ \G_{min}\neq\pm\G_{max},\,
	W_3\neq W_4=W_1\neq W_2
\end{equation}


\begin{rmk}\label{SminReduced}
 Assume the hypotheses \eqref{W1leastplus}.
Let $\b,\b'$ denote respectively the $G$-min up-down connection in Lemma \ref{newlemma:1}
and its neighbouring $G$-max up-down connection.  Consider the part of the top label of $\G$ consisting of the $(\cS\cup\cT)$-arcs connected to $\b$ and $\b'$.  
This is a strongly reduced path containing, for each $s\in\cS$, the $s_{min}$ edge of $\partial\b$ and the $s_{max}$ edge of $\partial\b'$.


It follows that the $s$-edges in $U_{max}\cdot U_{min}$ corresponding to the $s_{max}$ edge of $\partial\b'$ (in $U_{max}$) and the $s$-{min}-edge of $\partial\b$ (in $U_{min}$) survive after strong reduction.

Hence also, whenever in a reduced rectangular or annular picture  a $G$-max up-down connection $\b'$ is
joined to a $G$-min up-down connection $\b$ by all of the $\cS\cup\cT$ arcs in $W_1$, 
after strong reduction the $s_{min}$ arcs from $\b$ and the $s_{max}$ arcs from $\b'$ still go to the top boundary.
\end{rmk}


 
\section{Proof of Theorem \ref{2ComplexVersion}}\label{finalcurtain}
We have already proved in \S \ref{torsion} the result when $R$ is  proper power, so assume that it is not. 
The proof then is by induction on complexity, as explained in \S \ref{plan}, where the initial case of the induction is proved -- as is the existence of a $\Z$-cover $\wh{Y}$ of $Y$ to which the immersion $\iota_K:St(K)\to Y$ lifts.  By the inductive hypothesis, together with the results in \S\S \ref{first} and \ref{restrict}, we are reduced to the case where $Q=W_1$. 

\smallskip 
 
Let us suppose that the intersection 
of  $W_1\cdot\pi_1(X\cup\cT,v_1)\cdot W^{-1}$ and $\pi_1(X\cup\cS,v_0)$ in $\pi_1(Y,v_0)$ is not cyclic.

 
By the discussions in \S \ref{formW1}  we may assume the set of hypotheses \eqref{W1leastplus}.
It follows that any reduced rectangular picture $P$ with vertical sides labelled $W_1$   has the form 
\begin{equation}\label{W4form}
\pm(\G_{min}+\D+\G_{max}).
\end{equation}
for some $\D$.


Now if $P_1,P_2$ are any two reduced rectangular pictures of the form   $P_j=\G_{min}+\D_j+\G_{max}$, 
then $P_1+P_2$ is also reduced, and by Remark \ref{SminReduced} after strong reduction of the boundary, 
 for each $s\in\cS$
the $s_{max}$ arc on the right hand  $\G_{max}$ disc of $P_1$ still ends on the top, 
as does the $s_{min}$ arc on the left hand $\G_{min}$ disc of $P_2$.
Writing  
 $\ell(P)$ for the number of $\cS$ arcs meeting the top of $P$ between the   left-most $s_{min}$ edge ($s\in\cS$) of
the left hand  $\G_{min}$ disc of $P$ and 
the  right-most  $s_{max}$ edge ($s\in\cS$) of the right hand  $\G_{max}$ disc of $P$,
we have that 
we have $\ell(P_1+P_2) \ge \ell(P_1) + \ell(P_2)$.

We may choose a $(Y,W_1)$-CCE $(U_1,U_2,V_1,V_2)$ and reduced rectangular pictures $P_j$ representing the nullhomotopies $U_j=W_1V_jW_1^{-1}$ ($j=1,2$) such that 
\begin{itemize} 
\item $\ell(P_1)$ is smallest possible for $U_1\in K\setminus \{1\}$; and
\item $\ell(P_2)$ is smallest possible for $U_2\in K\setminus\<U_1\>$.
\end{itemize}




Now consider a reduced rectangular picture $P_3$ with strongly reduced top label $U_3$ that is obtained from $P_1-P_2$ by the processes of $\a$-disc cancellation and boundary surgery.  
As before,  $P_3$ has the form  $\pm(\G_{min}+\G_3+\G_{max})$. 
Since  $U_3=U_1U_2^{-1}\notin \<U_1\>$ we have $$\ell(P_3)\ge \ell(P_2)\ge\ell(P_1)>0$$ by the choice of $P_1$ and $P_2$.
But one of $P_3+P_2$, $-P_3+P_1$, after strong reduction on the boundary, 
is a reduced rectangular picture with top label $U_1$ or $U_2$, giving a contradictory inequality 
$\ell(P_1)\ge \ell(P_3)+\ell(P_2)$ or $\ell(P_2)\ge\ell(P_3)+\ell(P_1)$ respectively.  
This contradiction completes the proof.
