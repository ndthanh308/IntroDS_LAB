  "abstract": "The use of technology in healthcare has become increasingly popular in recent years, with the potential to improve how healthcare is delivered, patient outcomes, and cost-effectiveness. This review paper provides an overview of how technology has been used in healthcare, particularly in cities and for personalized medicine. The paper discusses different ways technology is being used in healthcare, such as electronic health records, telemedicine, remote monitoring, medical imaging, wearable devices, and artificial intelligence. It also looks at the challenges and problems that come with using technology in healthcare, such as keeping patient data private and secure, making sure different technology systems can work together, and ensuring patients are comfortable using technology. In addition, the paper explores the potential of technology in healthcare, including improving how easily patients can get care, the quality of care they receive, and the cost of care. It also talks about how technology can help personalize care to individual patients. Finally, the paper summarizes the main points, makes recommendations for healthcare providers and policymakers, and suggests directions for future research. Overall, this review shows how technology can be used to improve healthcare, while also acknowledging the challenges that come with using technology in this way.",
