abstract = {Testing is widely recognized as an important stage of the software development lifecycle. Effective software testing can provide benefits such as bug finding, preventing regressions, and documentation. In terms of documentation, unit tests express a unit's intended functionality, as conceived by the developer. A test oracle, typically expressed as an condition, documents the intended behavior of a unit under a given test prefix. Synthesizing a functional test oracle is a challenging problem, as it must capture the intended functionality rather than the implemented functionality.In this paper, we propose TOGA (a neural method for <u>T</u>est <u>O</u>racle <u>G</u>ener<u>A</u>tion), a unified transformer-based neural approach to infer both exceptional and assertion test oracles based on the context of the focal method. Our approach can handle units with ambiguous or missing documentation, and even units with a missing implementation. We evaluate our approach on both oracle inference accuracy and functional bug-finding. Our technique improves accuracy by 33% over existing oracle inference approaches, achieving 96% overall accuracy on a held out test dataset. Furthermore, we show that when integrated with a automated test generation tool (EvoSuite), our approach finds 57 real world bugs in large-scale Java programs, including 30 bugs that are not found by any other automated testing method in our evaluation.},

abstract = {Software testing is a key procedure to ensure high quality and reliability of software programs. The key issue in software testing is the selection and evaluation of different test cases. Code coverage has been proposed to be an estimator for testing effectiveness, but it remains a controversial topic which lacks of support from empirical data. In this study, we hypothesize that the estimation of code coverage on testing effectiveness varies under different testing profiles. To evaluate the performance of code coverage, we employ coverage testing and mutation testing in our experiment to investigate the relationship between code coverage and fault detection capability under different testing profiles. From our experimental data, code coverage is simply a moderate indicator for the capability of fault detection on the whole test set. However, it is clearly a good estimator for the fault detection of exceptional test cases, but a poor one for test cases in normal operations. For other testing profiles, such as functional testing and random testing, the correlation between code coverage and fault coverage is higher in functional test than in random testing, although these different testing profiles are complementary in the whole test set. The effects of different coverage metrics are also addressed in our experiment.},

abstract = {Test suites should test exceptional behavior to detect faults in error-handling code. However, manually-written test suites tend to neglect exceptional behavior. Automatically-generated test suites, on the other hand, lack test oracles that verify whether runtime exceptions are the expected behavior of the code under test. This paper proposes a technique that automatically creates test oracles for exceptional behaviors from Javadoc comments. The technique uses a combination of natural language processing and run-time instrumentation. Our implementation, Toradocu, can be combined with a test input generation tool. Our experimental evaluation shows that Toradocu improves the fault-finding effectiveness of EvoSuite and Randoop test suites by 8% and 16% respectively, and reduces EvoSuite’s false positives by 33%.},
