This study looks into the effectiveness of \acrlongpl*{LD} in revealing phase space organizing structures when facing the \acrlong*{BC} phenomenon, so investigating their capability in highlighting the \acrlong*{WSB}. They successfully reveal the geometrical structures governing the transport mechanisms that are then extracted through an edge detection algorithm based on the Roberts' operator to approximate the gradient of the \acrlong*{LD} scalar fields. The extracted separatrices effectively distinguish regions with different dynamical behavior. The detected patterns are in good agreement with the \acrlong*{WSB} computed on the same integration interval. \acrlongpl*{LD} proved to be an intuitive, easy to implement, and convenient tool for designing \acrlong*{BC} orbits. Without any a priory knowledge, \acrlong*{LD} patterns yield a consistent match with the \acrlong*{WSB} and the associated stable sets. The proposed methodology supports the design of \acrlong*{BC} orbits, enriching the dynamics knowledge in the proximity of the target planet. Furthermore, the technique can be successfully applied to arbitrary non-autonomous, more representative, astrodynamics models without any restrictions.
