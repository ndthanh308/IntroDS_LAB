Lagrangian descriptors reveal the dynamical skeleton governing transport mechanisms of a generic flow. In doing so, they unveil geometrical structures in the phase space that separate regions with different qualitative behavior. This work investigates to what extent \acrlongpl*{LD} provide information about non-Keplerian motion in Mars proximity, which is modeled under the planar \acrlong*{ER3BP}. We propose a novel technique to reveal \acrlong*{BC} orbits extracting separatrices of the phase space highlighted by \acrlong*{LD} scalar fields. The Roberts' operator to approximate the gradient is used to detect the edges in the fields. Results demonstrate the chaos indicator ability to distinguish sets of \acrlongpl*{IC} exhibiting different dynamics, including \acrlong*{BC} ones. Separatrices are validated against reference \acrlong*{WSB} derived on similar integration intervals. Compared to other techniques, \acrlongpl*{LD} provide dynamics insight bypassing the propagation of the variational equations.
