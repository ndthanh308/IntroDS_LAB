  "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a method for resume rating using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and entity detection with SpaCy. The proposed method first extracts relevant entities such as education, experience, and skills from the resume using SpaCy's Named Entity Recognition (NER). The LDA model then uses these entities to rate the resume by assigning topic probabilities to each entity. Furthermore, we conduct a detailed analysis of the entity detection using SpaCy's NER and report its evaluation metrics. Using LDA, our proposed system breaks down resumes into latent topics and extracts meaningful semantic representations. With a vision to define our resume score to be more content-driven rather than a structure and keyword match driven, our model has achieved 77% accuracy with respect to only skills in consideration and an overall 82% accuracy with all attributes in consideration. (like college name, work experience, degree and skills)",
