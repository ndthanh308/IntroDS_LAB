abstract = {Positional, structural, and dynamical parameters for all dwarf galaxies in and around the Local Group are presented, and various aspects of our observational understanding of this volume-limited sample are discussed. Over 100 nearby galaxies that have distance estimates reliably placing them within 3Mpc of the Sun are identified. This distance threshold samples dwarfs in a large range of environments, from the satellite systems of the MW and M31, to the quasi-isolated dwarfs in the outer regions of the Local Group, to the numerous isolated galaxies that are found in its surroundings. It extends to, but does not include, the galaxies associated with the next nearest groups, such as Maffei, Sculptor, and IC 342. Our basic knowledge of this important galactic subset and their resolved stellar populations will continue to improve dramatically over the coming years with existing and future observational capabilities, and they will continue to provide the most detailed information available on numerous aspects of dwarf galaxy formation and evolution. Basic observational parameters, such as distances, velocities, magnitudes, mean metallicities, as well as structural and dynamical characteristics, are collated, homogenized (as far as possible), and presented in tables that will be continually updated to provide a convenient and current online resource. As well as discussing the provenance of the tabulated values and possible uncertainties affecting their usage, the membership and spatial extent of the MW sub-group, M31 sub-group, and the Local Group are explored. The morphological diversity of the entire sample and notable sub-groups is discussed, and timescales are derived for the Local Group members in the context of their orbital/interaction histories. The scaling relations and mean stellar metallicity trends defined by the dwarfs are presented, and the origin of a possible "floor" in central surface brightness (and, more speculatively, stellar mean metallicity) at faint magnitudes is considered. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {We present a comprehensive and detailed study of the stellar populations of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. We analyse their spatial distributions along the main body of the galaxy, obtaining their surface density maps, together with their radial density profiles. Results are based on the largest and most complete catalogue of stars in Fornax, with more than 3.5 × 105 stars covering the main body of the galaxy up to V {\~{}} 24. We find a differentiated structure in Fornax depending on the stellar ages. Old stars (≳10 Gyr) follow an elliptical distribution well fitted by King profiles with relatively large core radius (rc = 760 ± 60 pc). On another hand, young populations (≲3 Gyr) concentrate in the central region of the galaxy (rc =210±10 pc), and are better fitted by S{\'{e}}rsic profiles with 0.8 {\textless} n {\textless} 1.2, indicating some discy shape. These stars show strong asymmetries and substructures not aligned with the main optical axes of Fornax. This together with the observed differences between metallicity and age distribution maps strongly suggests accretion of material with different angular momentum. These results lead us to propose a scenario in which Fornax has suffered a major merger at z {\~{}} 1.},

To complement the discussion and to serve as a foundation for future work, I present an extensive set of basic observational data in tables that summarize much of what we know, and what we still do not know, about these nearby dwarfs.

We apply this model to 40 dSphs using star counts from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, PanStarrs-1 Survey, Dark Energy Survey, and Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey. Using mock data, we examine systematic errors associated with modeling assumptions and identify conditions under which our model can identify “non-standard” stellar density profiles that have central cusps and/or steepened outer slopes. Applying our model to real dwarf spheroidals, we do not find evidence for centrally cusped density profiles among the fifteen Milky Way satellites for which our tests with mock data indicate there would be sufficient detectability. We do detect steepened (with respect to a standard Plummer model) outer profiles in several dSphs—Fornax, Leo I, Leo II, and Reticulum II—which may point to distinct evolutionary pathways for these objects. However, the outer slope of the stellar density profile does not yet obviously correlate with other observed galaxy properties.},

abstract = {We present the star formation history (SFH) of the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal galaxy based on deep g, r photometry taken with Dark Energy Camera at the Blanco telescope, focusing our analysis on the central region of the galaxy extended up to ∼3 core radii. We have investigated how the SFH changes radially, subdividing the sampled area into four regions, and have detected a clear trend of star formation. All the SFHs show a single episode of star formation, with the innermost region presenting a longer period of star formation of ∼1.5 Gyr and for the outermost region the main period of star formation is confined to ∼0.5 Gyr. We observe a gradient in the mean age which is found to increase going towards the outer regions. These results suggest that Sculptor continued forming stars after the reionization epoch in its central part, while in the peripheral region, the majority of stars probably formed during the reionization epoch and soon after its end. From our analysis, Sculptor cannot be considered strictly as a fossil of the reionization epoch.},

We used the ESO Wide Field Imager in conjunction with the Very Large Telescope/FLAMES spectrograph to study the properties of the resolved stellar population of Sculptor out to and beyond the tidal radius. We find that two components are discernible in the spatial distribution of horizontal branch stars in our imaging and in the [Fe/H] and vhel distributions for our large sample of spectroscopic measurements. They can be generally described as a "metal-poor" component ([Fe/H] -1.7). The metal-poor stars are more spatially extended than the metal-rich stars, and they also appear to be kinematically distinct. These results provide insight into the formation processes of small systems in the early universe and the conditions found there. Even this simplest of galaxies appears to have had a surprisingly complex early evolution.},

@article{Battaglia2006,
abstract = {Aims. As part of the DART project we have used the ESO/2.2m Wide Field Imager in conjunction with the VLT/FLAMES** GIRAFFE spectrograph to study the detailed properties of the resolved stellar population of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy out to and beyond its tidal radius. Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy has had a complicated evolution and contains significant numbers of young, intermediate age and old stars. We investigate the relation between these different components by studying their photometric, kinematic and abundance distributions. Methods. We re-derived the structural parameters of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal using our wide field imaging covering the galaxy out to its tidal radius, and analysed the spatial distribution of the Fornax stars of different ages as selected from colour-magnitude diagram analysis. We have obtained accurate velocities and metallicities from spectra in the Ca II triplet wavelength region for 562 Red Giant Branch stars which have velocities consistent with membership of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal. Results. We have found evidence for the presence of at least three distinct stellar components: a young population (few 100 Myr old) concentrated in the centre of the galaxy, visible as a Main Sequence in the colour-magnitude diagram; an intermediate age population (2-8 Gyr old); and an ancient population ({\textgreater}10 Gyr), which are distinguishable from each other kinematically, from the metallicity distribution and in the spatial distribution of stars found in the colour-magnitude diagram. Conclusions. From our spectroscopic analysis we find that the "metal rich" stars ([Fe/H] {\textless} -1.3) show a less extended and more concentrated spatial distribution, and display colder kinematics than the "metal poor" stars ([Fe/H] {\textless} -1.3). There is tentative evidence that the ancient stellar population in the centre of Fornax does not exhibit equilibrium kinematics. This could be a sign of a relatively recent accretion of external material, such as the merger of another galaxy or other means of gas accretion at some point in the fairly recent past, consistent with other recent evidence of substructure (Coleman et al. 2004, AJ, 127, 832; 2005, AJ, 129, 1443). {\textcopyright} ESO 2006.},

abstract = {We have obtained high-resolution spectroscopy of ten red giants in the Carina dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy with the ultraviolet and visual echelle spectrograph at the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope in order to study the detailed chemical evolution of this Galactic satellite. Here we present the abundances of O, Na, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, and Fe. By comparison of the derived iron abundances [Fe/H] with metallicities based on the well-established calcium triplet (CaT) calibration, [Fe/H]CaT, we show that the empirical CaT technique yields good agreement with the high-resolution data for [Fe/H] ≳ -2 dex, but tends to deviate from these data at lower metallicities. With [Fe/H] -1.7 dex the mean iron abundance of our targets is fully consistent with the peak metallicity of Carina as derived from medium-resolution spectroscopy and previous photometric studies, all calibrated onto iron via Galactic globular cluster scales. We identify two metal-poor stars with iron abundances of -2.72 and -2.50 dex. These stars are found to have enhanced [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios similar to the elemental ratios of stars in the Milky Way halo. In this context, it is conceivable that the moderately metal-poor halo stars may originate from an early dSph accretion event. The bulk of the Carina red giants exhibit a depletion in the [$\alpha$/Fe] abundance ratios with respect to the Galactic halo at a given metallicity. One of our targets with a moderately low [Fe/H] of -1.5 dex is considerably depleted in almost all of the $\alpha$-elements by 0.5 dex compared to the solar values. Such low values of the ratio of $\alpha$-elements to iron can be produced by stochastical fluctuations in terms of an incomplete mixing of single type Ia and type II supernova (SN) events into the interstellar medium. Moreover, the system's slow star-formation (SF) rate grants sufficient time for SNe I to occur. Our derived chemical element ratios are consistent with the episodic and extended SF in Carina previously derived from analyses of its color-magnitude diagram. We find a considerable star-to-star scatter in the abundance ratios. This suggests that Carina's SF history varies with position within the galaxy, with incomplete mixing. In addition, or alternatively, the SF rate is so low that the high-mass stellar initial mass function is sparsely populated, as expected on statistical grounds in low-mass star clusters, leading to true scatter in the resultant mass-integrated yields. Both ideas are consistent with slow stochastic SF in dissolving associations or star clusters, so that one may not speak prima facie of a single "SF history" at a detailed level. {\textcopyright} 2008.

The accurate velocities (±2 km s−1) and large area coverage of Scl allow us to measure a velocity gradient of 7.6+ 3.0−2.2 km s−1 deg−1 along the projected major axis of Scl, likely a signature of intrinsic rotation. We also use our kinematic data to measure the mass distribution within this system. By considering independently the kinematics of the two distinct stellar components known to be present in Scl, we are able to relieve known degeneracies and find that the observed velocity dispersion profiles are best fitted by a cored dark matter halo with core radius rc = 0.5 kpc and mass enclosed within the last measured point M({\textless}1.8 kpc) = (3.4 ± 0.7) × 108 M☉, assuming an increasingly radially anisotropic velocity ellipsoid. This results in a mass-to-light ratio of 158 ± 33 (M/L)☉ inside 1.8 kpc. An NFW profile with concentration c = 20 and mass M({\textless}1.8 kpc) = 2.2+ 1.0−0.7 × 108 M☉ is also statistically consistent with the observations, but it tends to yield poorer fits for the metal-rich stars.},

abstract = {We use Very Large Telescope (VLT)/Fibre Large Array Multi Element Spectrograph (FLAMES) intermediate-resolution (R∼ 6500) spectra of individual red giant branch stars in the near-infrared Caii triplet (CaT) region to investigate the wide-area metallicity properties and internal kinematics of the Sextans dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph). Our final sample consists of 174 probable members of Sextans with accurate line-of-sight velocities (±2kms-1) and CaT [Fe/H] measurements (±0.2dex). We use the Mgi line at 8806.8{\AA} as an empirical discriminator for distinguishing between probable members of the dSph (giant stars) and probable Galactic contaminants (dwarf stars). Sextans shows a similar chemodynamical behaviour to other Milky Way dSphs, with its central regions being more metal rich than the outer parts and with the more metal-rich stars displaying colder kinematics than the more metal-poor stars. Hints of a velocity gradient are found along the projected major axis and along an axis at position angle (PA) = 191°, however, a larger and more spatially extended sample may be necessary to pin down the amplitude and direction of this gradient. We detect a cold kinematic substructure at the centre of Sextans, consistent with being the remnant of a disrupted very metal poor stellar cluster. We derive the most extended line-of-sight velocity dispersion profile for Sextans, out to a projected radius of 16. From Jeans modelling of the observed line-of-sight velocity dispersion profile we find that this is consistent with both a cored dark matter halo with large core radius and cuspy halo with low concentration. The mass within the last measured point is in the range 2-4 × 108M⊙, giving very large mass-to-light ratios, from 460 to 920(M/L)V, ⊙. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2010 RAS.},

@article{Amorisco2012,
abstract = {A number of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies are known to contain a more extended, metal-poor population with a flattish velocity dispersion profile, and a more concentrated, metal-rich population with a velocity dispersion declining with radius. The two populations can be modelled with Michie–King distribution functions (DFs) in the isothermal and in the sharply truncated limits, respectively. We argue that the truncation of the metal-rich population can be traced back to the spatial distribution of the star-forming gas. Suppose $\delta$ is the exponent of the first non-constant term in the Taylor expansion of the total potential at the centre ($\delta$= 1 for Navarro–Frenk–White or NFW haloes, $\delta$= 2 for cored haloes). Then, we show that the ratio of the half-light radii of the populations R$\delta$/2h, 2/Rh, 1$\delta$/2 must be smaller than the ratio of the line-of-sight velocity dispersions $\sigma$los, 2(Rh, 2)/$\sigma$los, 1(Rh, 1).Specializing to the case of the Sculptor dSph, we develop a technique to fit simultaneously both populations with Michie–King DFs. This enables us to determine the mass profile of the Sculptor dSph with unprecedented accuracy in the radial range 0.2 {\textless} r {\textless} 1.2 kpc. We show that cored halo models are preferred over cusped halo models, with a likelihood ratio test rejecting NFW models at any significance level higher than 0.05 per cent. Even more worryingly, the best-fitting NFW models require concentrations with c ≲ 20, which is not in the cosmologically preferred range for dwarf galaxies. We conclude that the kinematics of multiple populations in dSphs provides a substantial new challenge for theories of galaxy formation, with the weight of available evidence strongly against dark matter cusps at the centre.},

@article{delPino2017,
abstract = {We present a novel analysis of the internal kinematics of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. Our results are based on the largest sample of spectroscopic data for Fornax stars presently available ({\textgreater}2500 stars), for which we have chemical and kinematic information. We introduce new software, beacon, designed to detect chemo-kinematic patterns among stars of different stellar populations using their metallicity and velocity along the line of sight. Applying beacon to Fornax, we have detected non-negligible rotation signals around main optical axes of the galaxy, characteristic for a triaxial system partially supported by rotation. The dominant rotation pattern is relatively strong (∼12 km s−1), but the galaxy also shows additional weaker albeit complex rotation patterns. Using the information available from the star formation history of Fornax, we have also derived the average age of the different chemo-kinematic components found by beacon, which has allowed us to obtain its kinematic history. Our results point to a possible major merger suffered by Fornax at redshift z ∼ 1, in agreement with the previous works.},

abstract = {Context. Aims. The goal of this paper is to demonstrate the outstanding quality of the second data release of the Gaia mission and its power for constraining many different aspects of the dynamics of the satellites of the Milky Way. We focus here on determining the proper motions of 75 Galactic globular clusters, nine dwarf spheroidal galaxies, one ultra-faint system, and the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds. Methods. Using data extracted from the Gaia archive, we derived the proper motions and parallaxes for these systems, as well as their uncertainties. We demonstrate that the errors, statistical and systematic, are relatively well understood. We integrated the orbits of these objects in three different Galactic potentials, and characterised their properties. We present the derived proper motions, space velocities, and characteristic orbital parameters in various tables to facilitate their use by the astronomical community. Results. Our limited and straightforward analyses have allowed us for example to (i) determine absolute and very precise proper motions for globular clusters; (ii) detect clear rotation signatures in the proper motions of at least five globular clusters; (iii) show that the satellites of the Milky Way are all on high-inclination orbits, but that they do not share a single plane of motion; (iv) derive a lower limit for the mass of the Milky Way of 9.1-2.6+6.2 × 1011 M{\^{a}}{\v{S}} based on the assumption that the Leo I dwarf spheroidal is bound; (v) derive a rotation curve for the Large Magellanic Cloud based solely on proper motions that is competitive with line-of-sight velocity curves, now using many orders of magnitude more sources; and (vi) unveil the dynamical effect of the bar on the motions of stars in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Conclusions. All these results highlight the incredible power of the Gaia astrometric mission, and in particular of its second data release.},

It is designed to be high-performance and to cope with large tables. The core library is format-neutral, with the work of serialization and deserialization performed by pluggable format-specific I/O handlers. This means that the programmer seees a high-level abstraction of a table which is easy to work with, and also that support for new data formats can be added easily. Supplied handlers provide support for VOTables, FITS table extensions, relational databases via SQL and plain text tables, amongst others. The VOTable handler is believed to be the only existing library capable of reading or writing all the defined VOTable encoding formats (tabledata, fits, binary). TOPCAT, based on STIL, is a user-friendly graphical program for viewing, analysis and editing of tables. It has facilities for plotting, cross matching, row selection, sorting and manipulation of data and metadata. Synthetic columns can be created and row selections made using a powerful and extensible algebraic expression language.},

abstract = {We present spectroscopic data for individual stars observed from 2004 March through 2008 August as part of our Michigan/MIKE Fiber System (MMFS) survey of four dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies: Carina, Fornax, Sculptor, and Sextans. Using MMFS at the Magellan/Clay Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, we have acquired 8855 spectra from 7103 red-giant candidates in these Galactic satellites. We list measurements of each star's line-of-sight velocity (median error 2.1 km s-1) and spectral line indices for iron and magnesium absorption features. We use globular cluster spectra to calibrate the indices onto standard [Fe/H] metallicity scales, but comparison of the resulting metallicities with published values suggests that the MMFS indices are best used as indicators of relative, not absolute, metallicity. The empirical distributions of velocity and spectral indices also allow us to quantify the amount of contamination by foreground stars. In a companion paper, we develop an algorithm that evaluates the membership probability for each star, showing that the present MMFS sample contains more than 5000 dSph members, including 774 Carina members, 2483 Fornax members, 1365 Sculptor members, and 441 Sextans members. {\textcopyright} 2009.

abstract = {Cluster analysis is a primary method for database mining. It is either used as a stand-alone tool to get insight into the distribution of a data set, e.g. to focus further analysis and data processing, or as a preprocessing step for other algorithms operating on the detected clusters. Almost all of the well-known clustering algorithms require input parameters which are hard to determine but have a significant influence on the clustering result. Furthermore, for many real-data sets there does not even exist a global parameter setting for which the result of the clustering algorithm describes the intrinsic clustering structure accurately. We introduce a new algorithm for the purpose of cluster analysis which does not produce a clustering of a data set explicitly; but instead creates an augmented ordering of the database representing its density-based clustering structure. This cluster-ordering contains information which is equivalent to the density-based clusterings corresponding to a broad range of parameter settings. It is a versatile basis for both automatic and interactive cluster analysis. We show how to automatically and efficiently extract not only 'traditional' clustering information (e.g. representative points, arbitrary shaped clusters), but also the intrinsic clustering structure. For medium sized data sets, the cluster-ordering can be represented graphically and for very large data sets, we introduce an appropriate visualization technique. Both are suitable for interactive exploration of the intrinsic clustering structure offering additional insights into the distribution and correlation of the data.},

abstract = {We present a detailed study of the viewing angles of the LMC disk plane. We find that our viewing direction differs considerably from the commonly accepted values, which has important implications for the structure of the LMC. The discussion is based on an analysis of spatial variations in the apparent magnitude of features in the near-IR color-magnitude diagrams extracted from the Deep Near-Infrared Southern Sky Survey (DENIS) and Two Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS). Sinusoidal brightness variations with a peak-to-peak amplitude of {\~{}}0.25 mag are detected as a function of position angle. The same variations are detected for asymptotic giant branch stars (using the mode of their luminosity function) and for red giant branch stars (using the tip of their luminosity function), and these variations are seen consistently in all of the near-IR photometric bands in both DENIS and 2MASS data. The observed spatial brightness variations are naturally interpreted as the result of distance variations because of one side of the LMC plane being closer to us than the opposite side. There is no evidence that any complicating effects, such as possible spatial variations in dust absorption or the age/metallicity of the stellar population, cause large-scale brightness variations in the near-IR at a level that exceeds the formal errors ({\~{}}0.03 mag). The best-fitting geometric model of an inclined plane yields an inclination angle i=34.7d+/-6.2d and line-of-nodes position angle $\Theta$=122.5d+/-8.3d. The quoted errors are conservative estimates that take into account the possible influence of systematic errors; the formal errors are much smaller, 0.7d and 1.6d, respectively. There is tentative evidence for variations of {\~{}}10° in the viewing angles with distance from the LMC center, suggesting that the LMC disk plane may be warped. Traditional methods to estimate the position angle of the line of nodes have used either the major-axis position angle $\Theta$maj of the spatial distribution of tracers on the sky or the position angle $\Theta$max of the line of maximum gradient in the velocity field, given that for a circular disk $\Theta$maj=$\Theta$max=$\Theta$. The present study does not rely on the assumption of circular symmetry and is considerably more accurate than previous studies of its kind. We find that the actual position angle of the line of nodes differs considerably from both $\Theta$maj and $\Theta$max, for which measurements have fallen in the range 140°-190°. This indicates that the intrinsic shape of the LMC disk is not circular but elliptical. Paper II of this series explores the implications of this result through a detailed study of the shape and structure of the LMC. The inclination angle inferred here is consistent with previous estimates, but this is to some extent a coincidence, given that also for the inclination angle most previous estimates were based on the incorrect assumption of circular symmetry.},

abstract = {We derive general expressions for the LMC velocity field which we fit to kinematical data for 1041 carbon stars. We demonstrate that all previous studies of LMC kinematics have made unnecessary over-simplifications that have led to incorrect estimates of important structural parameters. We compile and improve LMC proper motion estimates to support our analysis. We find that the kinematically determined position angle of the line of nodes is 129.9 +/- 6.0 deg. The LMC inclination changes at a rate di/dt = -103 +/- 61 deg/Gyr, a result of precession and nutation induced by Milky Way tidal torques. The LMC rotation curve V(R) has amplitude 49.8 +/- 15.9 km/s, 40{\%} lower than what has previously (and incorrectly) been inferred from e.g. HI. The dynamical center of the carbon stars is consistent with the center of the bar and the center of the outer isophotes, but not with the HI kinematical center. The enclosed mass inside 8.9 kpc is (8.7 +/- 4.3) x 10{\^{}}9 M{\_}sun, more than half of which is due to a dark halo. The LMC has a larger vertical thickness than has traditionally been believed. Its V/sigma is less than the value for the Milky Way thick disk. We discuss the implications for the LMC self-lensing optical depth. We determine the LMC velocity and orbit in the Galactocentric rest frame and find it to be consistent with the range of velocities that has been predicted by models for the Magellanic Stream. The Milky Way dark halo must have mass {\textgreater}4.3 x 10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} M{\_}sun and extent {\textgreater}39 kpc for the LMC to be bound. We predict the LMC proper motion velocity field, and discuss techniques for kinematical distance estimation. [ABRIDGED]},

abstract = {The 3D velocities of M31 and M33 are important for understanding the evolution and cosmological context of the Local Group. Their most massive stars are detected by Gaia, and we use Data Release 2 (DR2) to determine the galaxy proper motions (PMs). We select galaxy members based on, e.g., parallax, PM, color-magnitude-diagram location, and local stellar density. The PM rotation of both galaxies is confidently detected, consistent with the known line-of-sight rotation curves: {\$}V{\_}{\{}\backslashrm rot{\}} = -206\backslashpm86{\$} km s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} (counter-clockwise) for M31, and {\$}V{\_}{\{}\backslashrm rot{\}} = 80\backslashpm52{\$} km s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} (clockwise) for M33. We measure the center-of-mass PM of each galaxy relative to surrounding background quasars in DR2. This yields that {\$}({\{}\backslashmu{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashalpha*{\}},{\{}\backslashmu{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashdelta{\}}){\$} equals {\$}(65 \backslashpm 18 , -57 \backslashpm 15){\$} {\$}\backslashmu{\$}as yr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} for M31, and {\$}(31 \backslashpm 19 , -29 \backslashpm 16){\$} {\$}\backslashmu{\$}as yr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} for M33. In addition to the listed random errors, each component has an additional residual systematic error of 16 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}as yr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}. These results are consistent at 0.8{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} and 1.0{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} with the (2 and 3 times higher-accuracy) measurements already available from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical imaging and VLBA water maser observations, respectively. This lends confidence that all these measurements are robust. The new results imply that the M31 orbit towards the Milky Way is somewhat less radial than previously inferred, {\$}V{\_}{\{}\backslashrm tan, DR2+HST{\}} = 57{\^{}}{\{}+35{\}}{\_}{\{}-31{\}}{\$} km s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}, and strengthen arguments that M33 may be on its first infall into M31.

In the last two years, a total of ten new Milky Way satellites with effective surface brightness mu{\_}v {\textgreater}{\~{}} 28 mag/sq. arcsec have been discovered in SDSS data. They are less luminous, more irregular and appear to be more metal-poor than the previously-known nine Milky Way dwarf spheroidals. The relationship between these objects and other populations is discussed. We note that there is a paucity of objects with half-light radii between {\~{}}40 pc and {\~{}} 100 pc. We conjecture that this may represent the division between star clusters and dwarf galaxies.},

abstract = {We present low-resolution spectroscopy of 120 red giants in the Galactic satellite dwarf spheroidal (dSph) Leo I, obtained with GeminiN GMOS and Keck DEIMOS. We find stars with velocities consistent with membership of Leo I out to 1.3 King tidal radii. By measuring accurate radial velocities with a median measurement error of 4.6 km s-1, we find a mean systemic velocity of 284.2 km s-1 with a global velocity dispersion of 9.9 km s-1. The dispersion profile is consistent with being flat out to the last data point. We show that a marginally significant rise in the radial dispersion profile at a radius of 3' is not associated with any real localized kinematical substructure. Given its large distance from the Galaxy, tides are not likely to have affected the velocity dispersion, a statement we support from a quantitative kinematical analysis, as we observationally reject the occurrence of a significant apparent rotational signal or an asymmetric velocity distribution. Mass determinations adopting both isotropic stellar velocity dispersions and more general models yield an M/L of 24, which is consistent with the presence of a significant dark halo with a mass of about 3 × 107 M☉, in which the luminous component is embedded. This suggests that Leo I exhibits dark matter properties similar to those of other dSphs in the Local Group. Our data allowed us also to determine metallicities for 58 of the targets. We find a mildly metal-poor mean of -1.31 dex and a full spread covering 1 dex. In contrast to the majority of dSphs, Leo I appears to show no radial gradient in its metallicities, which points to a negligible role of external influences in this galaxy's evolution.},

abstract = {We present new kinematic results for 387 stars near the Milky Way satellite dwarf spheroidal galaxy Leo I. Spectra were obtained with the Hectochelle multiobject echelle spectrograph on the MMT, centered in the optical near 5200 {\AA}. From 297 repeat measurements of 108 stars, we estimate the mean velocity error (1 $\sigma$) of our sample to be 2.4 km s−1, with a systematic precision of ≤1 km s−1. The final sample of 328 Leo I members gives a mean heliocentric velocity of 282.9 ± 0.5 km s−1 and a dispersion of 9.2 ± 0.4 km s−1. The dispersion profile of Leo I is flat to beyond its classical “tidal” radius. We fit the profile to various equilibrium dynamical models. We strongly rule out all models where mass follows light. Anisotropic S{\'{e}}rsic+NFW models fit the dispersion profile well, but isotropic models are ruled out at a 95{\%} confidence level. Inside a projected radius of {\~{}}1040 pc, the mass and V-band mass-to-light ratio of Leo I from equilibrium models are in the ranges (5–7) × 107 M☉ and 9-14 (solar units), respectively. Leo I members outside a “break radius” of Rb ∼ 400″ (500 pc) exhibit significant velocity anisotropy, whereas stars interior to this radius are consistent with an isotropic velocity distribution. We interpret the break radius as the tidal radius of Leo I at perigalacticon some 1-2 Gyr ago. This interpretation accounts for the complex star formation history of Leo I, population segregation within the galaxy, and Leo I's large outward galactocentric velocity. The lack of evident tidal arms in Leo I suggests that the galaxy may have been injected into its present highly elliptical orbit by a third body a few Gyr before its last perigalacticon. This scenario is plausible within current hierarchical structure formation models.},

The second Gaia data release (DR2) contains very precise astrometric and photometric properties for more than one billion sources, astrophysical parameters for dozens of millions, radial velocities for millions, variability information for half a million stars from selected variability classes, and orbits for thousands of solar system objects. Aims. Before the catalogue was published, these data have undergone dedicated validation processes. The goal of this paper is to describe the validation results in terms of completeness, accuracy, and precision of the various Gaia DR2 data. Methods. The validation processes include a systematic analysis of the catalogue content to detect anomalies, either individual errors or statistical properties, using statistical analysis and comparisons to external data or to models. Results. Although the astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic data are of unprecedented quality and quantity, it is shown that the data cannot be used without dedicated attention to the limitations described here, in the catalogue documentation and in accompanying papers. We place special emphasis on the caveats for the statistical use of the data in scientific exploitation. In particular, we discuss the quality filters and the consideration of the properties, systematics, and uncertainties from astrometry to astrophysical parameters, together with the various selection functions.},

abstract = {The photometric and morphological properties, as well as the star formation history, of the Draco dwarf spheroidal galaxy are analyzed on the basis of wide-field CCD photometry of the resolved stars covering about 1 deg2. Draco is at a distance of d = 80 ± 7 kpc and has a metallicity, [Fe/H], of -1.8 ± 0.2. No metallicity gradient is detected. The star surface density distribution can be fitted by a single exponential law of scale length $\alpha$ = 5.′0 ± 0.′1. The central surface magnitude is $\mu$ = 24.4 ± 0.5, and the core radius is rc = 7.′5 ± 0.′3 (equivalent to rc = 175 ± 7 pc). Within errors, the same scale lengths are found for the density profiles along the semimajor and semiminor axes (rescaled to semimajor-axis units, using the ellipticity of the galaxy) of Draco. There are hence no evidences of a tidal tail associated with Draco. The tidal radius of the galaxy is found to be rt ≃ 42′ (≃1 kpc). The possibility that the large mass-to-light relation in Draco could be accounted for by a convenient spatial orientation is tested. An upper limit to Draco's size along the line of sight is ∼14 kpc. This is too small to account for the velocity dispersion of Draco if it were due to projection effects only, and it implies that other mechanisms (e.g., dark matter) are required. The stellar population of Draco is mainly old. Although some intermediate-age population is present in Draco, most of the star formation (up to 90{\%}) took place before ∼10 Gyr ago. No significant star formation activity is detected in the last ∼2 Gyr. Two methods (partial model and subgiant) have been used to investigate the star formation history of Draco, both producing results in good qualitative agreement. No difference is found between the scale lengths of the distributions of old (≳9 Gyr) and young (∼2–3 Gyr) stars, indicating either that both populations were formed under the same kinematic conditions, or that any initial difference was afterward erased.},

abstract = {As a part of a project devoted to the study of the Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy, the star formation history of the galaxy is presented. The analysis uses wide-field photometry, encompassing about 1° × 1° (the total covered area being 0.75 deg2), which samples the galaxy out to its tidal radius. Derivation of the star formation history (SFH) has been performed using the synthetic partial-model technique. The resulting SFH shows that Ursa Minor hosts a predominantly old stellar population, with virtually all the stars having formed earlier than 10 Gyr ago and 90{\%} having formed more than 13 Gyr ago. Nevertheless, the Ursa Minor color-magnitude diagram shows several stars above the main, old turnoff forming a blue plume (BP). If these stars were genuine main-sequence stars, Ursa Minor would have maintained a low star formation rate extending up to ∼2 Gyr ago. However, several indications (relative amount and spatial distribution of BP stars and difficulty of retaining processed gas) argue against this possibility. In such a context, the most reliable hypothesis is that BP stars are blue stragglers originating in the old population, with Ursa Minor hence remaining the only Milky Way dSph satellite to host a pure old stellar population. A marginally significant age gradient is detected, in the sense that stars in outer regions are slightly younger on average. The distance of Ursa Minor has been calculated using the magnitude of the horizontal branch and a calibration based on Hipparcos data for main-sequence subdwarfs. We estimate a distance of 76 ± 4 kpc, which is slightly higher than previous estimates. From the red giant branch color, we estimate a metallicity [Fe/H] = -1.9 ± 0.2, in agreement with a previous spectroscopic determination. No metallicity gradients have been detected across the galaxy.},

Within the errors of our SFH, we have not detected any metallicity gradient along the considered radial distance interval. As a main result of this work, we can state that the Sextans dwarf spheroidal stopped forming stars less than ∼1.3 Gyr after big bang in correspondence to the end of the reionization epoch. We have been able to constrain the duration of the main burst of star formation to ∼0.6 Gyr. From the calculation of the mechanical luminosity released from supernovae (SNe) during the brief episode of star formation, there are strong indications that SNe could have played an important role in the fate of Sextans, by removing almost completely the gas component, so preventing a prolonged star formation.},

abstract = {We present a detailed study of the star formation history (SFH) of the Tucana dwarf spheroidal galaxy. High-quality, deep HST/ACS data, collected in the framework of the LCID project, allowed us to obtain the deepest color-magnitude diagram to date, reaching the old main-sequence turnoff (F814 ∼ 29) with good photometric accuracy. Our analysis, based on three different SFH codes, shows that Tucana is an old and metal-poor stellar system, which experienced a strong initial burst of star formation at a very early epoch (≃13 Gyr ago) which lasted a maximum of 1 Gyr (sigma value). We are not able to unambiguously answer the question of whether most star formation in Tucana occurred before or after the end of the reionization era, and we analyze alternative scenarios that may explain the transformation of Tucana from a gas-rich galaxy into a dSph. Current measurements of its radial velocity do not preclude that Tucana may have crossed the inner regions of the Local Group (LG) once, and so gas stripping by ram pressure and tides due to a close interaction cannot be ruled out. A single pericenter passage would generate insufficient tidal heating to turn an originally disky dwarf into a true dSph; however, this possibility would be consistent with the observed residual rotation in Tucana. On the other hand, the high star formation rate measured at early times may have injected enough energy into the interstellar medium to blow out a significant fraction of the initial gas content. Gas that is heated but not blown out would also be more easily stripped via ram pressure. We compare the SFH inferred for Tucana with that of Cetus, the other isolated LG dSph galaxy in the LCID sample. We show that the formation time of the bulk of star formation in Cetus is clearly delayed with respect to that of Tucana. This reinforces the conclusion of Monelli et al. that Cetus formed the vast majority of its stars after the end of the reionization era implying, therefore, that small dwarf galaxies are not necessarily strongly affected by reionization, in agreement with many state-of-the-art cosmological models.},

abstract = {We use deep HST/ACS observations to calculate the star formation history (SFH) of the Cetus dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy. Our photometry reaches below the oldest main-sequence turnoffs, which allows us to estimate the age and duration of the main episode of star formation in Cetus. This is well approximated by a single episode that peaked roughly 12 ± 0.5 Gyr ago and lasted no longer than about 1.9 ± 0.5 Gyr (FWHM). Our solution also suggests that essentially no stars formed in Cetus during the past 8 Gyr. This makes Cetus' SFH comparable to that of the oldest Milky Way dSphs. Given the current isolation of Cetus in the outer fringes of the Local Group, the dominant old population implies that Cetus is a clear outlier in the morphology-Galactocentric distance relation that holds for the majority of the Milky Way dwarf satellites. Our results also show that Cetus continued forming stars until z≃ 1, long after the universe was reionized, and that there is no clear signature of the epoch of reionization in Cetus' SFH. We briefly discuss the implications of these results for dwarf galaxy evolution models. Finally, we present a comprehensive account of the data reduction and analysis strategy adopted for all galaxies targeted by the LCID (Local Cosmology from Isolated Dwarfs) project. We employ two different photometry codes (DAOPHOT/ALLFRAME and DOLPHOT), three different SFH reconstruction codes (IAC-pop/MinnIAC, MATCH, and COLE), and two stellar evolution libraries (BaSTI and Padova/Girardi), allowing for a detailed assessment of the modeling and observational uncertainties.},

The last star formation events, as young as 1 Gyr old, are mainly located in the central region, which may indicate that the gas reservoir in the outer parts of the galaxy would have been exhausted earlier than in the centre or removed by tidal interactions. The AMR is smoothly increasing in the three analysed regions and similar to each other, indicating that no significant metallicity gradient is apparent within and around the core radius of Fornax.

abstract = {Based on Hubble Space Telescope observations from the Local Cosmology from Isolated Dwarfs project, we present the star formation histories, as a function of galactocentric radius, of four isolated Local Group dwarf galaxies: two dSph galaxies, Cetus and Tucana, and two transition galaxies (dTrs), LGS-3 and Phoenix. The oldest stellar populations of the dSphs and dTrs are, within the uncertainties, coeval (∼13 Gyr) at all galactocentric radii. We find that there are no significative differences between the four galaxies in the fundamental properties (such as the normalized star formation rate or age-metallicity relation) of their outer regions (radii greater than four exponential scale lengths); at large radii, these galaxies consist exclusively of old (≳ 10.5 Gyr) metal-poor stars. The duration of star formation in the inner regions varies from galaxy to galaxy, and the extended central star formation in the dTrs produces the dichotomy between dSph and dTr galaxy types. The dTr galaxies show prominent radial stellar population gradients: The centers of these galaxies host young (≲ 1 Gyr) populations, while the age of the last formation event increases smoothly with increasing radius. This contrasts with the two dSph galaxies. Tucana shows a similar, but milder, gradient, but no gradient in age is detected Cetus. For the three galaxies with significant stellar population gradients, the exponential scale length decreases with time. These results are in agreement with outside-in scenarios of dwarf galaxy evolution, in which a quenching of the star formation toward the center occurs as the galaxy runs out of gas in the outskirts.},

Our data set consists of 186 member stars, 159 of which have good quality velocities, extending to a magnitude V ≈ 19.5 with a mean velocity precision of ≈2 km s−1. As this survey is based on a high-precision photometric target list, it contains many more Draco members at large radii. For the first time, this allows a robust determination of the radial behaviour of the velocity dispersion in a dSph.We find statistically strong evidence of a rising velocity dispersion consistent with a dark matter halo that has a gently rising rotation curve. There is a {\textless}2$\sigma$ signature of rotation about the long axis, inconsistent with tidal disruption as the source of the rising dispersion. By comparing our data set with earlier velocities, we find that Draco probably has a binary distribution and fraction comparable to those in the solar neighbourhood.We apply a novel maximum likelihood algorithm and fit the velocity data to a two parameter spherical model with an adjustable dark matter content and velocity anisotropy. Draco is best fit by a weakly tangentially anisotropic distribution of stellar orbits in a dark matter halo with a very slowly rising rotation law ($\upsilon$circ ∝ r0.17). We are able to rule out both a mass-follows-light distribution and an extended halo with a harmonic core at the 2.5 to 3$\sigma$ significance level, depending on the details of our assumptions about Draco's stellar binary population. Our modelling lends support to the idea that the dark matter in dwarf spheroidals is distributed in the form of massive, nearly isothermal haloes.},

In this Letter, however, we present evidence that the substructure has a cold kinematical signature and argue that UMi's clumpiness could indeed be a primordial artefact. Using numerical simulations, we demonstrate that substructure is incompatible with the cusped dark matter halos predicted by the prevailing cold dark matter (CDM) paradigm but is consistent with an unbound stellar cluster sloshing back and forth within the nearly harmonic potential of a cored dark matter halo. Thus, CDM appears to disagree with observation at the least massive, most dark matter-dominated end of the galaxy mass spectrum.},

abstract = {We develop, implement, and characterize an enhanced data reduction approach which delivers precise, accurate, radial velocities from moderate resolution spectroscopy with the fiber-fed VLT/FLAMES+GIRAFFE facility. This facility, with appropriate care, delivers radial velocities adequate to resolve the intrinsic velocity dispersions of the very faint dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. Importantly, repeated measurements let us reliably calibrate our individual velocity errors (0.2 kms–1 ⩽ $\delta$ V ⩽ 5 km s–1) and directly detect stars with variable radial velocities. We show, by application to the Bo{\"{o}}tes I dSph, that the intrinsic velocity dispersion of this system is significantly below 6.5 km s–1 reported by previous studies. Our data favor a two-population model of Bo{\"{o}}tes I, consisting of a majority “cold” stellar component, with velocity dispersion 2.4+0.9 – 0.5 km s–1, and a minority “hot” stellar component, with velocity dispersion ∼9 km s–1, although we cannot completely rule out a single component distribution with velocity dispersion 4.60.8 – 0.6 km s–1. We speculate that this complex velocity distribution actually reflects the distribution of velocity anisotropy in Bo{\"{o}}tes I, which is a measure of its formation processes.},

The dispersion profile of those stars with good membership probabilities is essentially flat, with an amplitude of 6.6 ± 0.7 km s-1 over the full radial extent of our data, which probe to the stellar boundary of this galaxy. We find no evidence of any significant apparent rotation or velocity asymmetry, which suggests that tidal effects cannot be invoked to explain Leo II's properties. From basic mass modeling, employing the Jeans equation, we derive a mass out to the limiting radius of (2.7 ± 0.5) × 107 M⊙ and a global mass-to-light ratio of 27-45 in solar units, depending on the adopted total luminosity. A cored halo profile and a mild amount of tangential velocity anisotropy is found to account well for Leo II's observed kinematics, although we cannot exclude the possibility of a cusped halo with radially varying velocity anisotropy. All in all, this galaxy exhibits dark matter properties that appear to be concordant with the other dSph satellites of the Milky Way, namely, a halo mass profile that is consistent with a central core and a total mass that is similar to the common mass scale seen in other dSphs.},

abstract = {The tidal stirring model posits the formation of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) via the tidal interactions between late-type, rotationally supported dwarfs and Milky-Way-sized host galaxies. Using a comprehensive set of collisionless N-body simulations, we investigate the efficiency of the tidal stirring mechanism for the origin of dSphs. In particular, we examine the degree to which the tidal field of the primary galaxy affects the sizes, masses, shapes, and kinematics of the disky dwarfs for a range of dwarf orbital and structural parameters. Our study is the first to employ self-consistent, equilibrium models for the progenitor dwarf galaxies constructed from a composite distribution function and consisting of exponential stellar disks embedded in massive, cosmologically motivated dark matter halos. Exploring a wide variety of dwarf orbital configurations and initial structures, we demonstrate that in the majority of cases the disky dwarfs experience significant mass loss and their stellar distributions undergo a dramatic morphological, as well as dynamical, transformation. Specifically, the stellar components evolve from disks to bars and finally to pressure-supported, spheroidal systems with kinematic and structural properties akin to those of the classic dSphs in the Local Group (LG) and similar environments. The self-consistency of the adopted dwarf models is crucial for confirming this complex transformation process via tidally induced dynamical instabilities and impulsive tidal heating of the stellar distribution. Our results suggest that such tidal transformations should be common occurrences within the currently favored cosmological paradigm and highlight the key factor responsible for an effective metamorphosis to be the strength of the tidal shocks at the pericenters of the orbit. We also demonstrate that the combination of short orbital times and small pericentric distances, characteristic of dwarfs being accreted by their hosts at high redshift, induces the strongest and most complete transformations. Our models also indicate that the efficiency of the transformation via tidal stirring is affected significantly by the structure of the progenitor disky dwarfs. While the mass-to-light ratios, M/L, of the dwarf galaxies typically decrease monotonically with time as the extended dark matter halos are efficiently tidally stripped, we identify a few cases where this trend is reversed later in the evolution when stellar mass loss becomes more effective. We also find that the dwarf remnants satisfy the relation , where $\sigma$* is the one-dimensional, central stellar velocity dispersion and V max is the maximum halo circular velocity, which has intriguing implications for the missing satellites problem. Assuming that the distant dSphs in the LG, such as Leo I, Tucana, and Cetus, are the products of tidal stirring, our findings suggest that these galaxies should have only been partially stirred by the tidal field of their hosts. We thus predict that these remote dwarfs should exhibit higher values of V rot/$\sigma$*, where V rot is the stellar rotational velocity, compared with those of dSphs located closer to the primary galaxies. Overall, we conclude that the action of tidal forces from the hosts constitutes a crucial evolutionary mechanism for shaping the nature of dwarf galaxies in environments such as that of the LG. Environmental mechanisms of this type should thus be included as ingredients in models of dwarf galaxy formation and evolution.},

The measured proper motion of Sculptor, expressed in the equatorial coordinate system, is ($\mu$$\alpha$, $\mu$$\delta$) = (9 ± 13, 2 ± 13) mas century-1. Removing the contributions from the motion of the Sun and the motion of the local standard of rest produces the proper motion in the Galactic rest frame: ($\mu$, $\mu$) = (-23 ± 13, 45 ± 13) mas century-1. The implied space velocity with respect to the Galactic center has a radial component of Vr = 79 ± 6 km s-1 and a tangential component of Vt = 198 ± 50 km s-1. Integrating the motion of Sculptor in a realistic potential for the Milky Way produces orbital elements. The perigalacticon and apogalacticon are 68 (31, 83) and 122 (97, 313) kpc, respectively, where the values in the parentheses represent the 95{\%} confidence interval derived from Monte Carlo experiments.

We also study the influence of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) on the orbits of Draco and Sculptor. Overall, the inclusion of the LMC increases the scatter in the orbital results. Based on our calculations, Draco shows a rather wide range of orbital parameters depending on the MW mass and inclusion/exclusion of the LMC, but Sculptor's orbit is very well constrained, with its most recent pericentric approach to the MW being 0.3–0.4 Gyr ago. Our new PMs imply that the orbital trajectories of both Draco and Sculptor are confined within the “Disk of Satellites,” better so than implied by earlier PM measurements, and likely rule out the possibility that these two galaxies were accreted together as part of a tightly bound group.},

abstract = {We present a new discrete chemo-dynamical axisymmetric modelling technique, which we apply to the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Sculptor. The major improvement over previous Jeans models is that realistic chemical distributions are included directly in the dynamical modelling of the discrete data. This avoids loss of information due to spatial binning and eliminates the need for hard cuts to remove contaminants and to separate stars based on their chemical properties. Using a combined likelihood in position, metallicity and kinematics, we find that our models naturally separate Sculptor stars into a metal-rich and a metal-poor population. Allowing for non-spherical symmetry, our approach provides a central slope of the dark matter density of $\gamma$ = 0.5 ± 0.3. The metal-rich population is nearly isotropic (with {\$}\backslashbeta {\_}{\{}\backslashrm r{\}}{\^{}}{\{}{\{}\backslashrm red{\}}{\}} = 0.0\backslashpm 0.1{\$}), while the metal-poor population is tangentially anisotropic (with {\$}\backslashbeta {\_}{\{}\backslashrm r{\}}{\^{}}{\{}{\{}\backslashrm blue{\}}{\}} = -0.2\backslashpm 0.1{\$}) around the half-light radius of 0.26 kpc. A weak internal rotation of the metal-rich population is revealed with vmax/$\sigma$0 = 0.15 ± 0.15. We run tests using mock data to show that a discrete data set with ∼6000 stars is required to distinguish between a core ($\gamma$ = 0) and cusp ($\gamma$ = 1), and to constrain the possible internal rotation to better than 1$\sigma$ confidence with our model. We conclude that our discrete chemo-dynamical modelling technique provides a flexible and powerful tool to robustly constrain the internal dynamics of multiple populations, and the total mass distribution in a stellar system.},

The structure of the galaxy models and the orbital configurations are chosen in accordance with those expected in a Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) universe. While tidal stirring of disky dwarfs produces objects whose stellar structure and kinematics resembles that of dwarf spheroidals after a few orbits, ram pressure stripping is needed to entirely remove their gas component. Gravitational tides can aid ram pressure stripping by diminishing the overall potential of the dwarf, but tides also induce bar formation which funnels gas inwards making subsequent stripping more difficult. This inflow is particularly effective when the gas can cool radiatively. Assuming a low density of the hot Galactic corona consistent with observational constraints, dwarfs with Vpeak \\&lt; 30 km s−1 can be completely stripped of their gas content on orbits with pericenters of 50 kpc or less. Instead, dwarfs with more massive dark haloes and Vpeak \\&gt; 30 km s−1 lose most or all of their gas content only if a heating source keeps the gas extended, partially counteracting the bar-driven inflow. We show that the ionizing radiation from the cosmic ultraviolet (UV) background at z \\&gt; 2 can provide the required heating. In these objects, most of the gas is removed or becomes ionized at the first pericenter passage, explaining the early truncation of the star formation observed in Draco and Ursa Minor. Galaxies on orbits with larger pericenters and/or falling into the Milky Way halo at lower redshift can retain significant amounts of the centrally concentrated gas. These dwarfs would continue to form stars over a longer period of time, especially close to pericenter passages, as observed in Fornax and other dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) of the Local Group. The stripped gas breaks up into individual clouds pressure confined by the outer gaseous medium that have masses, sizes and densities comparable to the H-i clouds recently discovered around M31.}",

abstract = {A conclusive model for the formation of dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies still remains elusive. Owing to their proximity to the massive spirals Milky Way (MW) and M31, various environmental processes have been invoked to explain their origin. In this context, the tidal stirring model postulates that interactions with MW-sized hosts can transform rotationally supported dwarfs, resembling present-day dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies, into systems with the kinematic and structural properties of dSphs. Using N-body+SPH simulations, we investigate the dependence of this transformation mechanism on the gas fraction, f
gas, in the disk of the progenitor dwarf. Our numerical experiments incorporate for the first time the combined effects of radiative cooling, ram-pressure stripping, star formation, supernova (SN) winds, and a cosmic UV background. For a given orbit inside the primary galaxy, rotationally supported dwarfs with gas fractions akin to those of observed dIrrs (f
gas ≳ 0.5), demonstrate a substantially enhanced likelihood and efficiency of transformation into dSphs relative to their collisionless (f
gas = 0) counterparts. We argue that the combination of ram-pressure stripping and SN winds causes the gas-rich dwarfs to respond more impulsively to tides, augmenting their transformation. When f
gas ≳ 0.5, disky dwarfs on previously unfavorable low-eccentricity or large-pericenter orbits are still able to transform. On the widest orbits, the transformation is incomplete; the dwarfs retain significant rotational support, a relatively flat shape, and some gas, naturally resembling transition-type systems. We conclude that tidal stirring constitutes a prevalent evolutionary mechanism for shaping the structure of dwarf galaxies within the currently favored CDM cosmological paradigm.},

The orbital pericenters are well constrained, with a mean value of 38 kpc. Only one satellite, Tucana III, is on an orbit passing within 15 kpc of the Galactic center, suggesting that the remaining ultra-faint dwarfs are unlikely to have experienced severe tidal stripping. As a group, the ultra-faint dwarfs are on high-velocity, eccentric, retrograde trajectories, with nearly all of them having space motions exceeding 370 km s−1. A large majority of the objects are currently close to the pericenters of their orbits. In a low-mass (M
vir = 0.9 × 1012 M
⊙) Milky Way potential, eight out of the 17 galaxies lack well-defined apocenters and appear likely to be on their first infall, indicating that the Milky Way mass may be larger than previously estimated or that many of the ultra-faint dwarfs are associated with the Magellanic Clouds. The median eccentricity of the ultra-faint dwarf orbits is 0.79, similar to the values seen in numerical simulations but distinct from the rounder orbits of the more luminous dwarf spheroidals.},

) = (0.1140 ± 0.0295, –0.1256 ± 0.0293) mas yr–1. The implied Galactocentric velocity vector, corrected for the reflex motion of the Sun, has radial and tangential components V
rad = 167.9 ± 2.8 km s–1 and V
tan = 101.0 ± 34.4 km s–1, respectively. We study the detailed orbital history of Leo I by solving its equations of motion backward in time for a range of plausible mass models for the Milky Way (MW) and its surrounding galaxies. Leo I entered the MW virial radius 2.33 ± 0.21 Gyr ago, most likely on its first infall. It had a pericentric approach 1.05 ± 0.09 Gyr ago at a Galactocentric distance of 91 ± 36 kpc. We associate these timescales with characteristic timescales in Leo I's star formation history, which shows an enhanced star formation activity ∼2 Gyr ago and quenching ∼1 Gyr ago. There is no indication from our calculations that other galaxies have significantly influenced Leo I's orbit, although there is a small probability that it may have interacted with either Ursa Minor or Leo II within the last ∼1 Gyr. For most plausible MW masses, the observed velocity implies that Leo I is bound to the MW. However, it may not be appropriate to include it in models of the MW satellite population that assume dynamical equilibrium, given its recent infall. Solution of the complete (non-radial) timing equations for the Leo I orbit implies an MW mass , with the large uncertainty dominated by cosmic scatter. In a companion paper, we compare the new observations to the properties of Leo I subhalo analogs extracted from cosmological simulations.},

abstract = {We take deep images of four ultra faint dwarf (UFD) galaxies, Canes Venatici I (CVn I), Bo{\"{o}}tes I (Bo{\"{o}} I), Canes Venatici II (CVn II), and Leo IV, using the Suprime-Cam on the Subaru Telescope. Color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) extend below main-sequence turnoffs (MSTOs) and yield measurements of the ages of stellar populations. The stellar populations of three faint galaxies, the Bo{\"{o}} I, CVn II, and Leo IV dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs), are estimated to be as old as the Galactic globular cluster M92. We confirm that Bo{\"{o}} I dSph has no intrinsic color spread in the MSTO and no spatial difference in the CMD morphology, which indicates that Bo{\"{o}} I dSph is composed of an old single stellar population. One of the brightest UFDs, CVn I dSph, shows a relatively younger age (∼12.6 Gyr) with respect to Bo{\"{o}} I, CVn II, and Leo IV dSphs, and the distribution of red horizontal branch (HB) stars is more concentrated toward the center than that of blue HB stars, suggesting that the galaxy contains complex stellar populations. Bo{\"{o}} I and CVn I dSphs show the elongated and distorted shapes. CVn II dSph has the smallest tidal radius of a Milky Way satellite and has a distorted shape, while Leo IV dSph shows a less concentrated spherical shape. The simple stellar population of faint UFDs indicates that the gases in their progenitors were removed more effectively than those of brighter dSphs at the occurrence of their initial star formation. This is reasonable if the progenitors of UFDs belong to less massive halos than those of brighter dSphs.},

Irrespective of their nature, these objects must subsequently have undergone hierarchical clustering, whose present scale we infer from the large-scale distribution of galaxies. As each stage of the hierarchy forms and collapses, relaxation effects wipe out its substructure, leading to a self-similar distribution of bound masses of the type discussed by Press \\&amp; Schechter. The entire luminous content of galaxies, however, results from the cooling and fragmentation of residual gas within the transient potential wells provided by the dark matter. Every galaxy thus forms as a concentrated luminous core embedded in an extensive dark halo. The observed sizes of galaxies and their survival through later stages of the hierarchy seem inexplicable without invoking substantial dissipation; this dissipation allows the galaxies to become sufficiently concentrated to survive the disruption of their halos in groups and clusters of galaxies. We propose a specific model in which \\$\\Omega \\simeq 0.2\\$, the dark matter makes up 80 per cent of the total mass, and half the residual gas has been converted into luminous galaxies by the present time. This model is consistent with the inferred proportions of dark matter, luminous matter and gas in rich clusters, with the observed luminosity density of the Universe and with the observed radii of galaxies; further, it predicts the characteristic luminosities of bright galaxies and can give a luminosity function of the observed shape.}",

An attractive feature of this cold dark matter hypothesis is its considerable predictive power: the post-recombination fluctuation spectrum is calculable, and it in turn governs the formation of galaxies and clusters. Good agreement with the data is obtained for a Zeldovich (|$\delta$k|2 ∝ k) spectrum of primordial fluctuations.},

    abstract = "{We present simulations of the formation and evolution of galaxy clusters in the cold dark matter cosmogony. Clusters with a wide range of mass were selected from previous N-body models, and were resimulated at higher resolution using a combined N-body/Smooth Particle hydrodynamics code. The effects of radiative cooling on the gas are neglected. While many present-day clusters are predicted to be undergoing mergers, the density profiles of those that are approximately in equilibrium are all very similar, both for the gas and for the dark matter. These profiles show no sign of a uniform-density core and steepen gradually from the centre outwards. The standard β-model is a reasonable fit over most of the radius range observable in real clusters. However, the value obtained for the slope parameter βf increases with the outermost radius of the fit. Temperature profiles of different simulated clusters are also similar. Typically the temperature is almost uniform in the regions that emit most of the X-ray flux but drops at larger radii. The gas temperature and dark matter velocity dispersion in equilibrium clusters give values of βT≡ μmp σ2DM/KT which are consistent with unity provided an X-ray emission-weighted temperature is used. Larger values of βT are found in merging objects where there is a transient boost in the velocity dispersion of the system. Thus βT\\&gt; 1 may be an observational indicator of merging in real clusters. The similar structure of clusters of differing mass results in scaling relations between the X-ray and dynamical properties of clusters identified at any given redshift. These scalings are inconsistent with the observed slope of the luminosity-temperature relation or the observed sense of evolution of the cluster luminosity function. This suggests that the central properties of intracluster medium are determined by non-gravitational process such as radiative cooling or substantial pre-heating at high redshift.}",

abstract = {We present a new, probabilistic method for determining the systemic proper motions of Milky Way (MW) ultra-faint satellites in the Dark Energy Survey (DES). We utilize the superb photometry from the first public data release (DR1) of the DES to select candidate members and cross-match them with the proper motions from the Gaia DR2. We model the candidate members with a mixture model (satellite and MW) in spatial and proper motion space. This method does not require prior knowledge of satellite membership and can successfully determine the tangential motion of 13 DES satellites. With our method, we present measurements of the following satellites: Columba I, Eridanus III, Grus II, Phoenix II, Pictor I, Reticulum III, and Tucana IV. This is the first systemic proper motion measurement for several of these satellites, and the majority lack extensive spectroscopic follow-up studies. We compare these to the predictions of Large Magellanic Cloud satellites and the vast polar structure. With the high-precision DES photometry, we conclude that most of the newly identified member stars are very metal-poor ([Fe/H] ≲ −2), similar to other ultra-faint dwarf galaxies, while Reticulum III is likely more metal-rich. We also find potential members in the following satellites that might indicate their overall proper motion: Cetus II, Kim 2, and Horologium II. However, due to the small number of members in each satellite, spectroscopic follow-up observations are necessary to determine the systemic proper motion in these satellites.},

We identify 892 likely members, making this the largest UMi sample with line-of-sight velocity and metallicity measurements. Our Bayesian method detects two distinct chemodynamic populations with high significance (in logarithmic Bayes factor, ln B ∼ 33).

The effects of the orbit of the Sun around the Galactic center can account for this motion, and the residual proper motion of Sgr A* perpendicular to the plane of the Galaxy is -0.4 ± 0.9 km s-1. A maximum likelihood analysis of the motion expected for a massive object within the observed Galactic center stellar cluster indicates that Sgr A* contains more than about 10{\%} of the ≈4 × 106 M☉ deduced from stellar orbits. The intrinsic size of Sgr A*, as measured by several investigators, is less than 1 AU, and the implied mass density of {\~{}}1022 M☉ pc-3 is within about 3 orders of magnitude of a comparable supermassive black hole within its Schwarzschild radius. Our observations provide the first direct evidence that a compact radiative source at the center of a galaxy contains of order 106 M☉ and provides overwhelming evidence that it is in the form of a supermassive black hole. Finally, the existence of "intermediate-mass" black holes more massive than {\~{}}104 M☉ between roughly 103 and 105 AU from Sgr A* is excluded.},

abstract = {We present the results of 16 years of monitoring stellar orbits around the massive black hole in the center of the Milky Way, using high-resolution near-infrared techniques. This work refines our previous analysis mainly by greatly improving the definition of the coordinate system, which reaches a long-term astrometric accuracy of ≈300 $\mu$as, and by investigating in detail the individual systematic error contributions. The combination of a long-time baseline and the excellent astrometric accuracy of adaptive optics data allows us to determine orbits of 28 stars, including the star S2, which has completed a full revolution since our monitoring began. Our main results are: all stellar orbits are fit extremely well by a single-point-mass potential to within the astrometric uncertainties, which are now ≈6× better than in previous studies. The central object mass is , where the fractional statistical error of 1.5{\%} is nearly independent from R
0, and the main uncertainty is due to the uncertainty in R
0. Our current best estimate for the distance to the Galactic center is R
0 = 8.33 ± 0.35 kpc. The dominant errors in this value are systematic. The mass scales with distance as (3.95 ± 0.06) × 106(R
0/8 kpc)2.19
M
☉. The orientations of orbital angular momenta for stars in the central arcsecond are random. We identify six of the stars with orbital solutions as late-type stars, and six early-type stars as members of the clockwise-rotating disk system, as was previously proposed. We constrain the extended dark mass enclosed between the pericenter and apocenter of S2 at less than 0.066, at the 99{\%} confidence level, of the mass of Sgr A*. This is two orders of magnitudes larger than what one would expect from other theoretical and observational estimates.},

abstract = {We re-examine the stellar kinematics of the solar neighbourhood in terms of the velocity $\upsilon$⊙ of the Sun with respect to the local standard of rest. We show that the classical determination of its component V⊙ in the direction of Galactic rotation via Str{\"{o}}mberg's relation is undermined by the metallicity gradient in the disc, which introduces a correlation between the colour of a group of stars and the radial gradients of its properties. Comparing the local stellar kinematics to a chemodynamical model which accounts for these effects, we obtain (U, V, W)⊙= (11.1+0.69−0.75, 12.24+0.47−0.47, 7.25+0.37−0.36) km s−1, with additional systematic uncertainties ∼(1, 2, 0.5) km s−1. In particular, V⊙ is 7 km s−1 larger than previously estimated. The new values of (U, V, W)⊙ are extremely insensitive to the metallicity gradient within the disc.},

abstract = {We present star count data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey for 5.8 × 105 stars brighter than g' = 21 mag over 279 deg2 in two samples north and south of the Galactic plane. Using these high-latitude (49° {\textless} |b| {\textless} 64°) star counts we determine the Sun's distance from the Galactic midplane to be 27 ± 4 pc and the scale height of the old thin disk to be 330 ± 3 pc. Because of the photometric accuracy and large area sky coverage of these data, the color-magnitude diagram clearly reveals a significant thick-disk population distinct in color from a Galactic halo population. The position of the thick-disk turnoff is at g'-r' {\~{}} 0.33. Several questions about the existence of the thick disk and its origin are addressed through a set of model fits to the star count data. Our best-fit model gives a thick-disk scale height between 580 and 750 pc, below the original proposal of Gilmore and Reid, and the corresponding space number density normalization is 13{\%}-6.5{\%} of the thin disk. The conclusions reached in this paper favor a scenario in which the thick disk formed through the heating of a preexisting thin disk, with the heating mechanism being the merging of a satellite galaxy.
The density law for the Galactic halo population is also investigated. We find that the data support a flattened halo with c/a {\~{}} 0.55 ± 0.06 and a relatively flat power-law index (2.5 ± 0.3). The axis ratio of the visible halo found in this paper is compatible with that of dark halo, suggesting that they have the same shape and dynamical origin.},

abstract = {I describe the design, implementation, and usage of galpy, a python package for galactic-dynamics calculations. At its core, galpy consists of a general framework for representing galactic potentials both in python and in C (for accelerated computations); galpy functions, objects, and methods can generally take arbitrary combinations of these as arguments. Numerical orbit integration is supported with a variety of Runge-Kutta-type and symplectic integrators. For planar orbits, integration of the phase-space volume is also possible. galpy supports the calculation of action-angle coordinates and orbital frequencies for a given phase-space point for general spherical potentials, using state-of-the-art numerical approximations for axisymmetric potentials, and making use of a recent general approximation for any static potential. A number of different distribution functions (DFs) are also included in the current release; currently, these consist of two-dimensional axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric disk DFs, a three-dimensional disk DF, and a DF framework for tidal streams. I provide several examples to illustrate the use of the code. I present a simple model for the Milky Way's gravitational potential consistent with the latest observations. I also numerically calculate the Oort functions for different tracer populations of stars and compare them to a new analytical approximation. Additionally, I characterize the response of a kinematically warm disk to an elliptical m = 2 perturbation in detail. Overall, galpy consists of about 54,000 lines, including 23,000 lines of code in the module, 11,000 lines of test code, and about 20,000 lines of documentation. The test suite covers 99.6{\%} of the code. galpy is available at http://github.com/jobovy/galpy with extensive documentation available at http://galpy.readthedocs.org/en/latest.},

abstract = {We present initial results from a wide-field photometric survey of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy. The focus here is on a small overdensity of stars located approximately 17′ (670 pc in projection) from the center of Fornax. Based on imaging data in both V and I bands down to V ≈ 21, the dimensions of the feature are ∼1.′7 × 3.′2 (68 × 128 pc) with an average surface brightness of 25.8 mag arcsec-2 in V. A follow-up analysis using the deep B- and R-band data obtained by Stetson, Hesser, {\&} Smecker-Hane indicates that the overdensity is apparently dominated by a relatively young stellar population with an age of ≈2 Gyr, though the current data do not rule out the presence of older stars. Our preferred interpretation is that the overdensity represents shell structure in the Fornax dSph galaxy, a phenomenon previously unseen in dwarf galaxies. The shell may be the remnant of a merger with Fornax of a smaller, gas-rich system that occurred approximately 2 Gyr ago. The comparatively recent star formation seen in some dSph and dE galaxies may then also be the result of infall of small relatively gas-rich systems.},

The survey was made in two colours, and the resulting colour–magnitude data were used as a mask to select candidate Fornax RGB stars, thereby increasing the contrast of Fornax stars to background sources in the outer regions. Previously, we reported the presence of a shell (age 2 Gyr) located towards the centre of Fornax. In this contribution we reveal a second shell, significantly larger than the first, located 1.3° north-west from the centre of Fornax, outside the nominal tidal radius. Moreover, the distribution of Fornax RGB stars reveals two lobes extending to the spatial limit of our survey, and aligned with the minor axis and with the two shells. These results support the hypothesis of a merger between Fornax and a gas-rich companion approximately 2 Gyr ago.},

abstract = {Using deep wide-field photometry 3 yr data (Y3) from the Dark Energy Survey (DES), we present a panoramic study of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. The data presented here—a small subset of the full survey—uniformly cover a region of 25 deg2 centered on the galaxy to a depth of g ∼ 23.5. We use these data to study the structural properties of Fornax, overall stellar population, and its member stars in different evolutionary phases. We also search for possible signs of tidal disturbance. Fornax is found to be significantly more spatially extended than what early studies suggested. No statistically significant distortions or signs of tidal disturbances were found down to a surface brightness limit of ∼32.1 mag arcsec−2. However, there are hints of shell-like features located ∼20′–40′ from the center of Fornax that may be stellar debris from past merger events. We also find that intermediate-age and young main-sequence populations show different orientation at the galaxy center and have many substructures. The deep DES Y3 data allow us to characterize the age of those young stellar substructures with great accuracy, both those previously known and those newly identified as possible overdensities in this work, on the basis of their color–magnitude diagram morphology. We find that the youngest overdensities are all found on the eastern side of Fornax, where the Fornax field population itself is slightly younger than in the west. In summary, the high-quality DES Y3 data reveal that Fornax has many rich structures and provide insights into its complex formation history.},

abstract = {We present a detailed study of the internal structure and kinematics of the core of the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy (Sgr). Using machine-learning techniques, we have combined the information provided by 3300 RR Lyrae stars, more than 2000 spectroscopically observed stars, and the Gaia second data release to derive the full phase space, i.e., 3D positions and kinematics, of more than 1.2 × 105 member stars in the core of the galaxy. Our results show that Sgr has a bar structure ∼2.5 kpc long, and that tidal tails emerge from its tips to form what it is known as the Sgr stream. The main body of the galaxy, strongly sheared by tidal forces, is a triaxial (almost prolate) ellipsoid with its longest principal axis of inertia inclined 43° ± 6° with respect to the plane of the sky and axis ratios of 1:0.67:0.60. Its external regions are expanding mainly along its longest principal axis, yet the galaxy conserves an inner core of about 500×330×300 pc that shows no net expansion and is rotating at v rot = 4.13 ± 0.16 km s−1. The internal angular momentum of the galaxy forms an angle $\theta$ = 18° ± 6° with respect to its orbital angular momentum, meaning that Sgr is in an inclined prograde orbit around the Milky Way. We compared our results with predictions from N-body models with spherical, pressure-supported progenitors and a model whose progenitor is a flattened rotating disk. Only the rotating model, based on preexisting simulations aimed at reproducing the line-of-sight velocity gradients observed in Sgr, was able to reproduce the observed properties in the core of the galaxy.},

The member stars are selected using a reliable dynamical interloper removal scheme tested on simulated data. Our member selection is more restrictive than the one based on metallicity indicators as it removes not only contamination due to Milky Way stars but also the unbound stars from the tidal tails. We model the cleaned data sets by adjusting the solutions of the Jeans equations to the profiles of the projected velocity dispersion and kurtosis. The data are well reproduced by models where mass follows light and the best-fitting stellar orbits are isotropic to weakly tangential, as expected from the tidal stirring scenario. The Fornax dwarf, with more than 2400 member stars, is a dSph galaxy with the most accurately determined mass to date: its 1$\sigma$ error following from the sampling errors of the velocity moments is below 5 per cent. With mass-to-light ratio of 97 solar units, Sextans seems to be the most dark matter dominated of the four dSph galaxies.},

abstract = {This article presents and discusses a measurement of the proper motion for the Carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy (dSph) from images in two distinct fields in the direction of Carina taken with the Hubble Space Telescope, at three epochs. Each field contains a confirmed quasi-stellar object that is the reference point for measuring the proper motion of the dSph. The consecutive epochs are 1–2 yr apart. The components of the measured proper motion for Carina, expressed in the equatorial coordinate system, are $\mu$$\alpha$ = 22 ± 9 mas century-1 and $\mu$$\delta$ = 15 ± 9 mas century-1. The quoted proper motion is a weighted mean of two independent measurements and has not been corrected for the motions of the Sun and of the local standard of rest. Given the proper motion and its uncertainty, integrating the family of possible orbits of Carina in a realistic gravitational potential for the Milky Way indicates that Carina is bound gravitationally to the Milky Way and is close to apogalacticon. The best estimate of, and the 95{\%} confidence interval for, the apogalacticon of the orbit is 102 kpc and (102, 113) kpc, for the perigalacticon is 20 kpc and (3.0, 63) kpc, and for the orbital period is 1.4 Gyr and (1.3, 2.0) Gyr. Carina does not seem to be on a polar orbit. The best estimate of the inclination of the orbit with respect to the Galactic plane is 39°, but the 95{\%} confidence interval is so wide, (23°, 102°), that it includes a polar orbit. We are unable to confirm or to rule out the membership of Carina in a "stream" of galaxies in the Galactic halo because the difference between the observed and predicted directions of the proper motion is 1.6 times the uncertainty of the difference. Carina must contain dark matter to have survived the tidal interaction with the Milky Way until the present. The triggering of star formation by perigalacticon passages and crossings of the Galactic disk do not explain the history of star formation in Carina.},

abstract = {The tensor virial theorem is applied to elliptical galaxies having similar isophotes. In the absence of residual velocity anisotropy the shape of such a galaxy turns out to determine uniquely the ratio of the rotational and random kinetic energies independently of the galaxy's radial density-profile or the speed with which its form rotates. Curves are displayed of the expected projected ‘rotation' velocities of elliptical galaxies under a variety of assumptions about their forms and degrees of residual anisotropy. In the absence of residual velocity anisotropy prolate spheroidal galaxies rotate only three-quarters as fast as equivalently aspherical oblate galaxies. The isotropic oblate models being almost certainly eliminated by Illingworth's rotation-velocity data, the possibility that all ellipticals are prolate is investigated. A distribution of true ellipticities of prolate galaxies is derived which will account for the apparent ellipticities reported by Sandage, Freeman {\&} Stokes and the corresponding distribution of points in the (∊, $\upsilon$/$\sigma$) plane determined. If ellipticals are all prolate there should be only a weak correlation between apparent ellipticity and rotation velocity. This possibility is consistent with Illingworth{\&}s data. A better fit to the observations is provided by anisotropic oblate models. The limitations of these models as well as the implications of galactic rotation for cosmogony are discussed.},

Furthermore, the isolated dwarf galaxies have no obvious distinction in the velocity dispersion–half-light radius plane from the satellite galaxies of the Milky Way and M31. The similarity of the isolated and satellite galaxies' dynamics and structural parameters imposes limitations on environmental solutions to the ‘too big to fail' problem, wherein there are fewer dense dwarf satellite galaxies than would be expected from cold dark matter simulations. This data set also has many other applications for dwarf galaxy evolution, including the transformation of dwarf irregular into dwarf spheroidal galaxies. We intend to explore these issues in future work.},

abstract = { The lowest luminosity ( L) Milky Way satellite galaxies represent the extreme lower limit of the galaxy luminosity function. These ultra-faint dwarfs are the oldest, most dark matter–dominated, most metal-poor, and least chemically evolved stellar systems known. They therefore provide unique windows into the formation of the first galaxies and the behavior of dark matter on small scales. In this review, we summarize the discovery of ultra-faint dwarfs in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in 2005 and the subsequent observational and theoretical progress in understanding their nature and origin. We describe their stellar kinematics, chemical abundance patterns, structural properties, stellar populations, orbits, and luminosity function, as well as what can be learned from each type of measurement. We conclude the following: ▪ In most cases, the stellar velocity dispersions of ultra-faint dwarfs are robust against systematic uncertainties such as binary stars and foreground contamination. ▪ The chemical abundance patterns of stars in ultra-faint dwarfs require two sources of r-process elements, one of which can likely be attributed to neutron star mergers. ▪ Even under conservative assumptions, only a small fraction of ultra-faint dwarfs may have suffered significant tidal stripping of their stellar components. ▪ Determining the properties of the faintest dwarfs out to the virial radius of the Milky Way will require very large investments of observing time with future telescopes.Finally, we offer a look forward at the observations that will be possible with future facilities as the push toward a complete census of the Local Group dwarf galaxy population continues. },

We use proper motions (PMs) from the Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) and line-of-sight velocities (vlos) available in the literature to derive the systemic 3D motion of these systems. For six of them, namely the Carina, Draco, Fornax, Sculptor, Sextans, and Ursa Minor dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph), we study the internal kinematics projecting the stellar PMs into radial, VR (expansion/contraction), and tangential, VT (rotation), velocity components with respect to the centre of mass. We find significant rotation in the Carina (|VT| = 9.6 ± 4.5 km s−1 ), Fornax (|VT| = 2.8 ± 1.3 km s−1 ), and Sculptor (|VT| = 3.0 ± 1.0 km s−1 ) dSphs. Besides the Sagittarius dSph, these are the first measurements of internal rotation in the plane of the sky in the MW’s classical dSphs. All galaxies except Carina show |VT|/σv \\&lt; 1. We find that slower rotators tend to show, on average, larger sky-projected ellipticity (as expected for a sample with random viewing angles) and are located at smaller Galactocentric distances (as expected for tidal stirring scenarios in which rotation is transformed into random motions as satellites sink into the parent halo). However, these trends are small and not statistically significant, indicating that rotation has not played a dominant role in shaping the 3D structure of these galaxies. Either tidal stirring had a weak impact on the evolution of these systems or it perturbed them with similar efficiency regardless of their current Galactocentric distance.}",

	abstract = {The Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy has an anomalous number of globular clusters, five, for its stellar mass. There is a longstanding debate about a potential sixth globular cluster (Fornax 6) that has recently been ``rediscovered'' in DECam imaging. We present new Magellan/M2FS spectroscopy of the Fornax 6 cluster and Fornax dSph. Combined with literature data we identify ∼15--17 members of the Fornax 6 cluster, showing that this overdensity is indeed a star cluster and associated with the Fornax dSph. The cluster is significantly more metal-rich (mean metallicity of = −0.71 $\pm$ 0.05) than the other five Fornax globular clusters (−2.5 < [Fe/H] < −1.4) and more metal-rich than the bulk of Fornax. We measure a velocity dispersion of corresponding to an anomalously high mass-to-light of 15 < M/L < 258 at 90% confidence when calculated assuming equilibrium. Two stars inflate this dispersion and may be either Fornax field stars or as yet unresolved binary stars. Alternatively, the Fornax 6 cluster may be undergoing tidal disruption. Based on its metal-rich nature, the Fornax 6 cluster is likely younger than the other Fornax clusters, with an estimated age of ∼2 Gyr when compared to stellar isochrones. The chemodynamics and star formation history of Fornax shows imprints of major events such as infall into the Milky Way, multiple pericenter passages, star formation bursts, and/or potential mergers or interactions. Any of these events may have triggered the formation of the Fornax 6 cluster.},

This proper motion is a weighted mean of four independent measurements for three distinct fields. Each measurement uses a quasi-stellar object as a reference point. Removing the contribution of the motion of the Sun and of the local standard of rest to the measured proper motion produces a Galactic rest-frame proper motion of (μ,μ) = (24.4 $\pm$ 4.6, - 14.3 $\pm$ 4.1) mas century-1. The implied space velocity with respect to the Galactic center has a radial component of Vr = -31.8 $\pm$ 1.7 km s-1 and a tangential component of Vt = 196 $\pm$ 29 km s-1. Integrating the motion of Fornax in a realistic potential for the Milky Way produces orbital elements. The perigalacticon and apogalacticon are 118 (66, 137) and 152 (144, 242) kpc, respectively, where the values in the parentheses represent the 95% confidence intervals derived from Monte Carlo experiments. The eccentricity of the orbit is 0.13 (0.11, 0.38), and the orbital period is 3.2 (2.5, 4.6) Gyr. The orbit is retrograde and inclined by 101$\,^{\circ}$ (94$\,^{\circ}$, 107$\,^{\circ}$) to the Galactic plane. Fornax could be a member of a proposed "stream" of galaxies and globular clusters; however, the membership of another proposed galaxy in the stream, Sculptor, has been previously ruled out. Fornax is in the Kroupa-Theis-Boily plane, which contains 11 of the Galactic satellite galaxies, but its orbit will take it out of that plane.},

	abstract = {Based on Gaia Early Data Release 3 (EDR3), we estimate the proper motions of 46 dwarf galaxies of the Milky Way (MW). The uncertainties in proper motions, determined by combining both statistical and systematic errors, are smaller by a factor of 2.5 when compared with Gaia Data Release 2. We have derived orbits in four MW potential models that are consistent with the MW rotation curve, with total mass ranging from 2.8 × 1011 M ⊙ to 15 × 1011 M ⊙. Although the type of orbit (ellipse or hyperbola) are very dependent on the potential model, the pericenter values are firmly determined, largely independent of the adopted MW mass model. By analyzing the orbital phases, we found that the dwarf galaxies are highly concentrated close to their pericenter, rather than to their apocenter as expected from Kepler's law. This may challenge the fact that most dwarf galaxies are MW satellites, or alternatively indicates an unexpectedly large number of undiscovered dwarf galaxies lying very close to their apocenters. Between half and two-thirds of the satellites have orbital poles that indicate them to orbit along the vast polar structure, with the vast majority of these co-orbiting in a common direction also shared by the Magellanic Clouds, which is indicative of a real structure of dwarf galaxies.},

We reproduce the observed scaling relations between total radio power and X-ray emission, M500, and the Sunyaev-Zel’dovich Y500 parameter. The radio emission surface brightness profiles of our most massive clusters are in reasonable agreement with VLA measurements of Coma and Perseus. Finally, we discuss the fraction of detected extended radio haloes as a function of virial mass and source count functions for different instruments. Overall our results agree encouragingly well with observations, but a refined analysis requires a more sophisticated treatment of relativistic particles in large-scale galaxy formation simulations.}",

Comparison of observed magnesium and europium for individual stars in the Milky Way with the stellar abundances in our more than 850 Milky Way-like galaxies provides stringent constraints on our chemical evolutionary methods. Here, we use the magnesium-to-iron ratio as a proxy for the effects of our SNII (core-collapse supernovae) and SNIa (Type Ia supernovae) metal return prescription and as a comparison to a variety of galactic observations. The europium-to-iron ratio tracks the rare ejecta from neutron star–neutron star mergers, the assumed primary site of europium production in our models, and is a sensitive probe of the effects of metal diffusion within the gas in our simulations. We find that europium abundances in Milky Way-like galaxies show no correlation with assembly history, present-day galactic properties, and average galactic stellar population age. We reproduce the europium-to-iron spread at low metallicities observed in the Milky Way, and find it is sensitive to gas properties during redshifts z ≈ 2–4. We show that while the overall normalization of [Eu/Fe] is susceptible to resolution and post-processing assumptions, the relatively large spread of [Eu/Fe] at low [Fe/H] when compared to that at high [Fe/H] is quite robust.}",

Across the entire population the median colour transition time-scale Δtgreen is ∼1.6 Gyr, a value which drops for increasingly massive galaxies. We find signatures of the physical process of quenching: at fixed stellar mass, redder galaxies have lower star formation rates, gas fractions, and gas metallicities; their stellar populations are also older and their large-scale interstellar magnetic fields weaker than in bluer galaxies.

Total halo mass is a very good predictor of stellar mass, and vice versa: at z = 0, the 3D stellar mass measured within 30 kpc scales as ∝(M500c)0.49 with a ∼0.12 dex scatter. This is possibly too steep in comparison to the available observational constraints, even though the abundance of The Next Generation less-massive galaxies ( ≲ 1011 M⊙ in stars) is in good agreement with the measured galaxy stellar mass functions at recent epochs.

    abstract = "{Hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation have now reached sufficient volume to make precision predictions for clustering on cosmologically relevant scales. Here, we use our new IllustrisTNG simulations to study the non-linear correlation functions and power spectra of baryons, dark matter, galaxies, and haloes over an exceptionally large range of scales. We find that baryonic effects increase the clustering of dark matter on small scales and damp the total matter power spectrum on scales up to k ∼ 10 h Mpc−1 by 20 per cent. The non-linear two-point correlation function of the stellar mass is close to a power-law over a wide range of scales and approximately invariant in time from very high redshift to the present. The two-point correlation function of the simulated galaxies agrees well with Sloan Digital Sky Survey at its mean redshift z ≃ 0.1, both as a function of stellar mass and when split according to galaxy colour, apart from a mild excess in the clustering of red galaxies in the stellar mass range of109–1010 h−2 M⊙. Given this agreement, the TNG simulations can make valuable theoretical predictions for the clustering bias of different galaxy samples. We find that the clustering length of the galaxy autocorrelation function depends strongly on stellar mass and redshift. Its power-law slope γ is nearly invariant with stellar mass, but declines from γ ∼ 1.8 at redshift z = 0 to γ ∼ 1.6 at redshift z ∼ 1, beyond which the slope steepens again. We detect significant scale dependences in the bias of different observational tracers of large-scale structure, extending well into the range of the baryonic acoustic oscillations and causing nominal (yet fortunately correctable) shifts of the acoustic peaks of around ∼ 5 per cent.}",

    abstract = "{Hydrodynamic cosmological simulations at present usually employ either the Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) technique or Eulerian hydrodynamics on a Cartesian mesh with (optional) adaptive mesh refinement (AMR). Both of these methods have disadvantages that negatively impact their accuracy in certain situations, for example the suppression of fluid instabilities in the case of SPH, and the lack of Galilean invariance and the presence of overmixing in the case of AMR. We here propose a novel scheme which largely eliminates these weaknesses. It is based on a moving unstructured mesh defined by the Voronoi tessellation of a set of discrete points. The mesh is used to solve the hyperbolic conservation laws of ideal hydrodynamics with a finite-volume approach, based on a second-order unsplit Godunov scheme with an exact Riemann solver. The mesh-generating points can in principle be moved arbitrarily. If they are chosen to be stationary, the scheme is equivalent to an ordinary Eulerian method with second-order accuracy. If they instead move with the velocity of the local flow, one obtains a Lagrangian formulation of continuum hydrodynamics that does not suffer from the mesh distortion limitations inherent in other mesh-based Lagrangian schemes. In this mode, our new method is fully Galilean invariant, unlike ordinary Eulerian codes, a property that is of significant importance for cosmological simulations where highly supersonic bulk flows are common. In addition, the new scheme can adjust its spatial resolution automatically and continuously, and hence inherits the principal advantage of SPH for simulations of cosmological structure growth. The high accuracy of Eulerian methods in the treatment of shocks is also retained, while the treatment of contact discontinuities improves. We discuss how this approach is implemented in our new code arepo, both in 2D and in 3D, and is parallelized for distributed memory computers. We also discuss techniques for adaptive refinement or de-refinement of the unstructured mesh. We introduce an individual time-step approach for finite-volume hydrodynamics, and present a high-accuracy treatment of self-gravity for the gas that allows the new method to be seamlessly combined with a high-resolution treatment of collisionless dark matter. We use a suite of test problems to examine the performance of the new code and argue that the hydrodynamic moving-mesh scheme proposed here provides an attractive and competitive alternative to current SPH and Eulerian techniques.}",

    abstract = "{The inefficiency of star formation in massive elliptical galaxies is widely believed to be caused by the interactions of an active galactic nucleus (AGN) with the surrounding gas. Achieving a sufficiently rapid reddening of moderately massive galaxies without expelling too many baryons has however proven difficult for hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation, prompting us to explore a new model for the accretion and feedback effects of supermassive black holes. For high-accretion rates relative to the Eddington limit, we assume that a fraction of the accreted rest mass energy heats the surrounding gas thermally, similar to the ‘quasar mode’ in previous work. For low-accretion rates, we invoke a new, pure kinetic feedback model that imparts momentum to the surrounding gas in a stochastic manner. These two modes of feedback are motivated both by theoretical conjectures for the existence of different types of accretion flows as well as recent observational evidence for the importance of kinetic AGN winds in quenching galaxies. We find that a large fraction of the injected kinetic energy in this mode thermalizes via shocks in the surrounding gas, thereby providing a distributed heating channel. In cosmological simulations, the resulting model produces red, non-star-forming massive elliptical galaxies, and achieves realistic gas fractions, black hole growth histories and thermodynamic profiles in large haloes.}",

The overall framework builds upon the successes of the Illustris galaxy formation model, and includes prescriptions for star formation, stellar evolution, chemical enrichment, primordial and metal-line cooling of the gas, stellar feedback with galactic outflows, and black hole formation, growth and multimode feedback. In this paper, we give a comprehensive description of the physical and numerical advances that form the core of the IllustrisTNG (The Next Generation) framework. We focus on the revised implementation of the galactic winds, of which we modify the directionality, velocity, thermal content and energy scalings, and explore its effects on the galaxy population. As described in earlier works, the model also includes a new black-hole-driven kinetic feedback at low accretion rates, magnetohydrodynamics and improvements to the numerical scheme. Using a suite of (25 Mpc h−1)3 cosmological boxes, we assess the outcome of the new model at our fiducial resolution. The presence of a self-consistently amplified magnetic field is shown to have an important impact on the stellar content of 1012 M⊙ haloes and above. Finally, we demonstrate that the new galactic winds promise to solve key problems identified in Illustris in matching observational constraints and affecting the stellar content and sizes of the low-mass end of the galaxy population.}",

This simulation occupies a unique combination of large volume and high resolution, with a 50 Mpc box sampled by 21603 gas cells (baryon mass of 8 × 104 M⊙). The median spatial resolution of star-forming interstellar medium gas is ∼100−140 pc. This resolution approaches or exceeds that of modern ‘zoom’ simulations of individual massive galaxies, while the volume contains ∼20 000 resolved galaxies with \\$M\_\\star \\gtrsim 10^7\\$ M⊙. Herein we show first results from TNG50, focusing on galactic outflows driven by supernovae as well as supermassive black hole feedback. We find that the outflow mass loading is a non-monotonic function of galaxy stellar mass, turning over and rising rapidly above 1010.5 M⊙ due to the action of the central black hole (BH). The outflow velocity increases with stellar mass, and at fixed mass it is faster at higher redshift. The TNG model can produce high-velocity, multiphase outflows that include cool, dense components. These outflows reach speeds in excess of 3000 km s−1 out to 20 kpc with an ejective, BH-driven origin. Critically, we show how the relative simplicity of model inputs (and scalings) at the injection scale produces complex behaviour at galactic and halo scales. For example, despite isotropic wind launching, outflows exhibit natural collimation and an emergent bipolarity. Furthermore, galaxies above the star-forming main sequence drive faster outflows, although this correlation inverts at high mass with the onset of quenching, whereby low-luminosity, slowly accreting, massive BHs drive the strongest outflows.}",

Within its virial radius this model contains about 2 × 107 dark matter particles and almost 5000 distinct dynamically resolved galaxies. Simulations of this same cluster at a variety of resolutions allow us to check explicitly for numerical convergence both of the dark matter structures produced by our new parallel N-body and substructure identification codes, and of the galaxy populations produced by the phenomenological models we use to follow cooling, star formation, feedback and stellar aging. This baryonic modelling is tuned so that our simulations reproduce the observed properties of isolated spirals outside clusters. Without further parameter adjustment our simulations then produce a luminosity function, a mass-to-light ratio, luminosity, number and velocity dispersion profiles, and a morphology–radius relation which are similar to those observed in real clusters. In particular, since our simulations follow galaxy merging explicitly, we can demonstrate that it accounts quantitatively for the observed cluster population of bulges and elliptical galaxies.}",

    abstract = "{The abundance and structure of dark matter subhaloes have been analysed extensively in recent studies of dark-matter-only simulations, but comparatively little is known about the impact of baryonic physics on halo substructures. We here extend the subfind algorithm for substructure identification such that it can be reliably applied to dissipative hydrodynamical simulations that include star formation. This allows, in particular, the identification of galaxies as substructures in simulations of clusters of galaxies and a determination of their content of gravitationally bound stars, dark matter and hot and cold gas. Using a large set of cosmological cluster simulations, we present a detailed analysis of halo substructures in hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy clusters, focusing in particular on the influence both of radiative and non-radiative gas physics and of non-standard physics such as thermal conduction and feedback by galactic outflows. We also examine the impact of numerical nuisance parameters such as artificial viscosity parameterizations. We find that diffuse hot gas is efficiently stripped from subhaloes when they enter the highly pressurized cluster atmosphere. This has the effect of decreasing the subhalo mass function relative to a corresponding dark-matter-only simulation. These effects are mitigated in radiative runs, where baryons condense in the central subhalo regions and form compact stellar cores. However, in all cases, only a very small fraction, of the order of one per cent, of subhaloes within the cluster virial radii preserve a gravitationally bound hot gaseous atmosphere. The fraction of mass contributed by gas in subhaloes is found to increase with the cluster-centric distance. Interestingly, this trend extends well beyond the virial radii, thus showing that galaxies feel the environment of the pressurized cluster gas over fairly large distances. The compact stellar cores (i.e. galaxies) are generally more resistant against tidal disruption than pure dark matter subhaloes. Still, the fraction of star-dominated substructures within our simulated clusters is only ∼10 per cent. We expect that the finite resolution in our simulations makes the galaxies overly susceptible to tidal disruption, hence the above fraction of star-dominated galaxies should represent a lower limit for the actual fraction of galaxies surviving the disruption of their host dark matter subhalo.}",

    abstract = "{The Milky Way (MW) and M31 both harbour massive satellite galaxies, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and M33, which may comprise up to 10 per cent of their host's total mass. Massive satellites can change the orbital barycentre of the host–satellite system by tens of kiloparsec and are cosmologically expected to harbour dwarf satellite galaxies of their own. Assessing the impact of these effects crucially depends on the orbital histories of the LMC and M33. Here, we revisit the dynamics of the MW–LMC system and present the first detailed analysis of the M31–M33 system utilizing high-precision proper motions and statistics from the dark-matter-only Illustris cosmological simulation. With the latest Hubble Space Telescope proper motion measurements of M31, we reliably constrain M33's interaction history with its host. In particular, like the LMC, M33 is either on its first passage (tinf \\&lt; 2 Gyr ago) or if M31 is massive (≥2 × 1012 M⊙), it is on a long-period orbit of about 6 Gyr. Cosmological analogues of the LMC and M33 identified in Illustris support this picture and provide further insight about their host masses. We conclude that, cosmologically, massive satellites such as the LMC and M33 are likely completing their first orbits about their hosts. We also find that the orbital energies of such analogues prefer an MW halo mass ∼1.5 × 1012 M⊙ and an M31 halo mass ≥1.5 × 1012 M⊙. Despite conventional wisdom, we conclude it is highly improbable that M33 made a close (\\&lt;100 kpc) approach to M31 recently (tperi \\&lt; 3 Gyr ago). Such orbits are rare (\\&lt;1 per cent) within the 4σ error space allowed by observations. This conclusion cannot be explained by perturbative effects through four-body encounters amongst the MW, M31, M33, and the LMC. This surprising result implies that we must search for a new explanation for M33's strongly warped gas and stellar discs.}",

	abstract = {High precision proper motion (PM) measurements are available for approximately 20% of all known dwarf satellite galaxies of the Milky Way (MW). Here we extend the Bayesian framework of Patel et al. to include all MW satellites with measured 6D phase-space information and apply it with the Illustris-Dark simulation to constrain the MW's mass. Using the properties of each MW satellite individually, we find that the scatter among mass estimates is reduced when the magnitude of specific orbital angular momentum (j) is adopted, rather than their combined instantaneous positions and velocities. We also find that high j satellites (i.e., Leo II) constrain the upper limits for the MW's mass and low j satellites, rather than the highest speed satellites (i.e., Leo I and Large Magellanic Cloud), set the lower mass limits. When j of all classical satellites is used to simultaneously estimate the MW's mass, we conclude the halo mass is 0.85+0.23−0.26 × 1012 (including Sagittarius dSph) and 0.96+0.29−0.28 × 1012 (excluding Sagittarius dSph), cautioning that low j satellites on decaying orbits like Sagittarius dSph may bias the distribution. These estimates markedly reduce the current factor of two spread in the mass range of the MW. We also find a well-defined relationship between host halo mass and satellite j distribution, which yields the prediction that upcoming PMs for ultra-faint dwarfs should reveal j within 5 × 103--104 kpc km s−1. This is a promising method to significantly constrain the cosmologically expected mass range for the MW and eventually M31 as more satellite PMs become available.},

The key factors that determine the dwarfs’ SFHs are their central/satellite status and stellar mass, with centrals and more massive dwarfs assembling their stellar mass at later times, on average, compared to satellites and lower mass dwarfs. Satellites (in hosts of mass \\$M\_\\{\\rm 200c, host\\}=10^\\{12-14.3\\}\\, \\{\\rm M\\}\_\\{\\odot \\}\\$) assembled 90 per cent of their stellar mass \\$\\{\\sim\\}7.0\_\\{-5.5\\}^\\{+3.3\\}\\$ Gyr ago, on average and within the 10th to 90th percentiles, while the centrals did so only \\$\\{\\sim\\}1.0\_\\{-0.5\\}^\\{+4.0\\}\\$ Gyr ago. TNG50 predicts a large diversity in SFHs, so that individual dwarfs can have significantly different cumulative SFHs compared to the stacked median SFHs. Satellite dwarfs with the highest stellar mass to host cluster mass ratios have the latest stellar mass assembly. Conversely, satellites at fixed stellar and host halo mass found closer to the cluster centre or accreted at earlier times show significantly earlier stellar mass assembly. These trends and the shapes of the SFHs themselves are a manifestation of the varying proportions within a given subsample of quenched versus star-forming galaxies, which exhibit markedly distinct SFH shapes. Finally, satellite dwarfs in the most massive hosts have higher SFRs at early times, well before accretion into their z = 0 host, compared to a control sample of centrals mass-matched at the time of accretion. This is the result of the satellites being preprocessed in smaller hosts prior to accretion. Our findings are useful theoretical predictions for comparison to future resolved stellar population observations.}",

	abstract = {As part of a major program to use isolated Local Group dwarf galaxies as near-field probes of cosmology, we have obtained deep images of the dwarf irregular galaxy Leo A with the Advanced Camera for Surveys aboard the Hubble Space Telescope. From these images we have constructed a color-magnitude diagram (CMD) reaching apparent [absolute] magnitudes of (M475, M814) ≳ (29.0 [+4.4], 27.9 [+3.4]), the deepest ever achieved for any irregular galaxy beyond the Magellanic Clouds. We derive the star formation rate (SFR) as a function of time over the entire history of the galaxy. We find that over 90% of all the star formation that ever occurred in Leo A happened more recently than 8 Gyr ago. The CMD shows only a very small amount of star formation in the first few billion years after the big bang; a possible burst at the oldest ages cannot be claimed with high confidence. The peak SFR occurred ≈1.5-4 Gyr ago, at a level 5-10 times the current value. Our modeling indicates that Leo A has experienced very little metallicity evolution; the mean inferred metallicity is consistent with measurements of the present-day gas-phase oxygen abundance. We cannot exclude a scenario in which all of the ancient star formation occurred prior to the end of the era of reionization, but it seems unlikely that the lack of star formation prior to ≈8 Gyr ago was due to early loss or exhaustion of the in situ gas reservoir.},

Our observations reach the oldest main sequence turn-off, allowing a time resolution at the oldest ages of ∼1 Gyr. Our analysis shows that the SFH of the observed field in IC 1613 is consistent with being constant over the entire lifetime of the galaxy. These observations rule out an early dominant episode of star formation in IC 1613. We compare the SFH of IC 1613 with expectations from cosmological models. Since most of the mass is in place at early times for low-mass halos, a naive expectation is that most of the star formation should have taken place at early times. Models in which star formation follows mass accretion result in too many stars formed early and gas mass fractions that are too low today (the ``over-cooling problem''). The depth of the present photometry of IC 1613 shows that, at a resolution of ∼1 Gyr, the star formation rate is consistent with being constant, at even the earliest times, which is difficult to achieve in models where star formation follows mass assembly.},

	abstract = {We present an analysis of the star formation history (SFH) of the transition-type (dIrr/dSph) Local Group galaxy LGS-3 (Pisces) based on deep photometry obtained with the Advanced Camera for Surveys onboard the Hubble Space Telescope. Our observations reach the oldest main-sequence turnoffs at high signal to noise, allowing a time resolution at the oldest ages of σ ∼ 1.1 Gyr. Our analysis, based on three different SFH codes, shows that the SFH of LGS-3 is dominated by a main episode ∼11.7 Gyr ago with a duration of ∼1.4 Gyr. Subsequently, LGS-3 continued forming stars until the present, although at a much lower rate. Roughly 90% of the stars in LGS-3 were formed in the initial episode of star formation. Extensive tests of self-consistency, uniqueness, and stability of the solution have been performed together with the IAC-star/IAC-pop/MinnIAC codes, and these results are found to be independent of the photometric reduction package, the stellar evolution library, and the SFH recovery method. There is little evidence of chemical enrichment during the initial episode of star formation, after which the metallicity increased more steeply reaching a present-day value of Z ∼ 0.0025. This suggests a scenario in which LGS-3 first formed stars mainly from infalling fresh gas, and after about 9 Gyr ago, from a larger fraction of recycled gas. The lack of early chemical enrichment is in contrast to that observed in the isolated dSph galaxies of comparable luminosity, implying that the dSphs were more massive and subjected to more tidal stripping. We compare the SFH of LGS-3 with expectations from cosmological models. Most or all the star formation was produced in LGS-3 after the reionization epoch, assumed to be completed at z ∼ 6 or ∼12.7 Gyr ago. The total mass of the galaxy is estimated to be between 2 and 4 × 108 M☉ corresponding to circular velocities between 28 km s−1 and 36 km s−1. These values are close to but somewhat above the limit of 30 km s−1 below which the UV background is expected to prevent any star formation after reionization. Feedback from supernovae (SNe) associated with the initial episode of star formation (mechanical luminosity from SNe Lw = 5.3 × 1038 erg s−1) is probably inadequate to completely blow away the gas. However, the combined effects of SN feedback and UV background heating might be expected to completely halt star formation at the reionization epoch for the low mass of LGS-3; this suggests that self-shielding is important to the early evolution of galaxies in this mass range.},

The color-magnitude diagram synthesis method is well established as the most accurate way to determine star-formation histories of galaxies back to the earliest times. This approach received a large boost from the exceptional data sets that wide-field CCD imagers on the ground and the Hubble Space Telescope could provide. Spectroscopic studies using large ground-based telescopes such as VLT, Magellan, Keck, and HET have allowed the determination of abundances and kinematics for significant samples of stars in nearby dwarf galaxies. These studies have shown how the properties of stellar populations can vary spatially and temporally. This leads to important constraints to theories of galaxy formation and evolution. The combination of spectroscopy and imaging and what they have taught us about dwarf galaxy formation and evolution is the aim of this review. },

We obtained their detailed surface density maps together with their radial density profiles. The two populations differ not only in age and metallicity, but also in their spatial distribution and kinematics. Old stars (≳11 Gyr) follow a round distribution well fitted by truncated density profiles. These stars rotate around the projected optical major axis of the galaxy with line-of-sight velocities vlos(rh) = 16 ± 3 km s−1 and a velocity gradient of 2.06 ± 0.21 km s−1 arcmin−1. Intermediate-age stars (≲9 Gyr) concentrate in the centre of the galaxy and form an elongated structure extending along the projected optical major axis. This structure appears to rotate with a velocity gradient of 2.24 ± 0.22 km s−1 arcmin−1 and around the optical minor axis. The centres of rotation and kinetic position angles (PAkin) of both populations differ. For intermediate-age stars we obtained PAkin = 18° ± 2° and for the old ones PAkin = 63° ± 3° in good agreement with photometric PA measured from isopleths fitted to the photometry. We conclude that the two stellar populations may not be fully relaxed and thus be the result of a merger occurred at redshift z ∼ 1.75.}",

	abstract = {We develop an algorithm for estimating parameters of a distribution sampled with contamination. We employ a statistical technique known as ``expectation maximization'' (EM). Given models for both member and contaminant populations, the EM algorithm iteratively evaluates the membership probability of each discrete data point, then uses those probabilities to update parameter estimates for member and contaminant distributions. The EM approach has wide applicability to the analysis of astronomical data. Here we tailor an EM algorithm to operate on spectroscopic samples obtained with the Michigan-MIKE Fiber System (MMFS) as part of our Magellan survey of stellar radial velocities in nearby dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. These samples, to be presented in a companion paper, contain discrete measurements of line-of-sight velocity, projected position, and pseudo-equivalent width of the Mg-triplet feature, for ∼1000--2500 stars per dSph, including some fraction of contamination by foreground Milky Way stars. The EM algorithm uses all of the available data to quantify dSph and contaminant distributions. For distributions (e.g., velocity and Mg-index of dSph stars) assumed to be Gaussian, the EM algorithm returns maximum-likelihood estimates of the mean and variance, as well as the probability that each star is a dSph member. These probabilities can serve as weights in subsequent analyses. Applied to our MMFS data, the EM algorithm identifies more than 5000 stars as probable dSph members. We test the performance of the EM algorithm on simulated data sets that represent a range of sample size, level of contamination, and amount of overlap between dSph and contaminant velocity distributions. The simulations establish that for samples ranging from large (N ∼ 3000, characteristic of the MMFS samples) to small (N ∼ 30), resembling new samples for extremely faint dSphs), the EM algorithm distinguishes members from contaminants and returns accurate parameter estimates much more reliably than conventional methods of contaminant removal (e.g., sigma clipping).},

	abstract = {We apply the Jeans equation to estimate masses for eight of the brightest dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. For Fornax, the dSph with the largest kinematic data set, we obtain a model-independent constraint on the maximum circular velocity, Vmax = 20+4−3 km s−1. Although we obtain only lower limits of Vmax ≳ 10 km s−1 for the remaining dSphs, we find that in all cases the enclosed mass at the projected half-light radius is well constrained and robust to a wide range of halo models and velocity anisotropies. We derive a simple analytic formula that estimates M(rhalf) accurately with respect to results from the full Jeans analysis. Applying this formula to the entire population of Local Group dSphs with published kinematic data, we demonstrate a correlation such that M(rhalf) ∝ r1.4$\pm$0.4half, or in terms of the mean density interior to the half-light radius, 〈ρ〉 ∝ r−1.6$\pm$0.4half. This relation is driven by the fact that the dSph data exhibit a correlation between global velocity dispersion and half-light radius. We argue that tidal forces are unlikely to have introduced this relation, but tides may have increased the scatter and/or altered the slope. While the data are well described by mass profiles ranging over a factor of ≲2 in normalization (Vmax ∼ 10--20 km s−1), we consider the hypothesis that all dSphs are embedded within a ``universal'' dark matter halo. We show that in addition to the power law M ∝ r1.4, viable candidates include a cuspy ``Navarro--Frenk--White'' halo with Vmax ∼ 15 km s−1 and scale radius r0 ∼ 800 pc, as well as a cored halo with Vmax ∼ 13 km s−1 and r0 ∼ 150 pc. Finally, assuming that their measured velocity dispersions accurately reflect their masses, the smallest dSphs now allow us to resolve dSph densities at radii as small as a few tens of pc. At these small scales, we find mean densities as large as 〈ρ〉 ≲ 5 M☉ pc−3 (≲200 GeV cm−3).},

	abstract = {We present carbon abundances of red giants in Milky Way (MW) globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Our sample includes measurements of carbon abundances for 154 giants in the clusters NGC 2419, M68, and M15 and 398 giants in the dSphs Sculptor, Fornax, Ursa Minor, and Draco. This sample doubles the number of dSph stars with measurements of [C/Fe]. The [C/Fe] ratio in the clusters decreases with increasing luminosity above , which can be explained by deep mixing in evolved giants. The same decrease is observed in dSphs, but the initial [C/Fe] of the dSph giants is not uniform. Stars in dSphs at lower metallicities have larger [C/Fe] ratios. We hypothesize that [C/Fe] (corrected to the initial carbon abundance) declines with increasing [Fe/H] due to the metallicity dependence of the carbon yield of asymptotic giant branch stars and due to the increasing importance of SNe Ia at higher metallicities. We also identified 11 very carbon-rich giants (eight previously known) in three dSphs. However, our selection biases preclude a detailed comparison to the carbon-enhanced fraction of the MW stellar halo. Nonetheless, the stars with in dSphs follow a different [C/Fe] track with [Fe/H] than the halo stars. Specifically, [C/Fe] in dSphs begins to decline at lower [Fe/H] than in the halo. The difference in the metallicity of the [C/Fe] ``knee'' adds to the evidence from [α/Fe] distributions that the progenitors of the halo had a shorter timescale for chemical enrichment than the surviving dSphs.},

The uniformity of the relation is in contradiction to previous estimates of metallicity based on photometry. This relationship is roughly continuous with the stellar mass--stellar metallicity relation for galaxies as massive as M* = 1012 M☉. Although the average metallicities of dwarf galaxies depend only on stellar mass, the shapes of their metallicity distributions depend on galaxy type. The metallicity distributions of dIrrs resemble simple, leaky box chemical evolution models, whereas dSphs require an additional parameter, such as gas accretion, to explain the shapes of their metallicity distributions. Furthermore, the metallicity distributions of the more luminous dSphs have sharp, metal-rich cut-offs that are consistent with the sudden truncation of star formation due to ram pressure stripping.},

For the purposes of validating our measurements, we also observed 445 red giants in MW globular clusters and 21 field red giants in the MW halo. The measurements are based on Keck/DEIMOS medium-resolution spectroscopy (MRS) combined with spectral synthesis. We estimate uncertainties in [Fe/H] by quantifying the dispersion of [Fe/H] measurements in a sample of stars in monometallic globular clusters (GCs). We estimate uncertainties in Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti abundances by comparing to high-resolution spectroscopic abundances of the same stars. For this purpose, a sample of 132 stars with published high-resolution spectroscopy in GCs, the MW halo field, and dwarf galaxies has been observed with MRS. The standard deviations of the differences in [Fe/H] and 〈[α/Fe]〉 (the average of [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Ca/Fe], and [Ti/Fe]) between the two samples is 0.15 and 0.16, respectively. This catalog represents the largest sample of multi-element abundances in dwarf galaxies to date. The next papers in this series draw conclusions on the chemical evolution, gas dynamics, and star formation histories from the catalog presented here. The wide range of dwarf galaxy luminosity reveals the dependence of dwarf galaxy chemical evolution on galaxy stellar mass.},

	abstract = {The Carina dwarf spheroidal galaxy is the only galaxy of this type that shows clearly episodic star formation separated by long pauses. Here we present metallicities for 437 radial velocity members of this Galactic satellite. The metallicities and radial velocities were measured as part of a Large Programme with the Very Large Telescope at the European Southern Observatory, Chile. We obtained medium-resolution spectroscopy with the multiobject spectrograph FLAMES. Our target red giants cover the entire projected surface area of Carina. Our spectra are centered at the near-infrared Ca II triplet, which is a well-established metallicity indicator for old and intermediate-age red giants. The resulting data sample provides the largest collection of spectroscopically derived metallicities for a Local Group dwarf spheroidal galaxy to date. Four of our likely radial velocity members of Carina lie outside this galaxy's nominal tidal radius, supporting earlier claims of the possible existence of such stars beyond the main body of Carina. We find a mean metallicity of [Fe/H] ∼ -1.7 dex on the 1997 metallicity scale of Carretta and Gratton for Carina. The formal FWHM of the metallicity distribution function is 0.92 dex, while the full range of metallicities is found to span approximately -3.0 dex < [Fe/H] < 0.0 dex. The metallicity distribution function might be indicative of several subpopulations distinct in metallicity. There appears to be a mild radial gradient such that more metal-rich populations are more centrally concentrated, matching a similar trend for an increasing fraction of intermediate-age stars (see the 2001 work of Harbeck and coworkers). This, as well as the photometric colors of the more metal-rich red giants, suggests that Carina exhibits an age-metallicity relation. Indeed, the age-metallicity degeneracy seems to conspire to form a narrow red giant branch despite the considerable spread in metallicity and wide range of ages. The metallicity distribution function is not well matched by a simple closed-box model of chemical evolution. Qualitatively better matches are obtained by chemical models that also take into account infall and outflows. A G dwarf problem remains for all these models.},

	abstract = {We present metallicities and ages for 52 red giants in the remote Galactic dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy Leo II. These stars cover the entire surface area of Leo II and are radial velocity members. We obtained medium-resolution multifiber spectroscopy with FLAMES as part of a Large Program with the Very Large Telescope at the European Southern Observatory, Chile. The metallicities were determined based on the well-established near-infrared Ca II triplet technique. This allowed us to achieve a mean random error of 0.16 dex on the metallicities, while other systematic effects, such as unknown variations in the dSph's [Ca/Fe] ratio, may introduce a further source of uncertainty of the order of 0.1 dex. The resulting metallicity distribution is asymmetric and peaks at [Fe/H] = -1.74 dex on the Carretta & Gratton scale. The full range in metallicities extends from -2.4 to -1.08 dex. As in other dSph galaxies, no extremely metal-poor red giants were found. We compare Leo II's observed metallicity distribution with model predictions for several other Galactic dSphs from the literature. Leo II clearly exhibits a lack of more metal-poor stars, analogous to the classical G dwarf problem, which may indicate a comparable "K giant problem." Moreover, its evolution appears to have been affected by galactic winds. We use our inferred metallicities as an input parameter for isochrone fits to Sloan Digital Sky Survey photometry of our target stars and derive approximate ages. The resulting age-metallicity distribution covers the full age range from 2 to about 15 Gyr on our adopted isochrone scale. During the first ∼7 Gyr relative to the oldest stars, the metallicity of Leo II appears to have remained almost constant, centering on the mean metallicity of this galaxy. The almost constant metallicity at higher ages and a slight drop by about 0.3 dex thereafter may be indicative of rejuvenation by low-metallicity gas. Overall, the age-metallicity relation appears to support the formation of Leo II from preenriched gas. Evidence for enrichment is seen during the recent 2-4 Gyr. Our findings support earlier derived photometric findings of Leo II as a galaxy with a prominent old population and dominant intermediate-age populations. We do not see a significant indication of a radial metallicity gradient or age gradient in our current data.},

	abstract = {The gas content of the complete compilation of Local Group dwarf galaxies (119 within 2 Mpc) is presented using H i survey data. Within the virial radius of the Milky Way (224 kpc here), 53 of 55 dwarf galaxies are devoid of gas to limits of M H i < 104 M ⊙. Within the virial radius of M31 (266 kpc), 27 of 30 dwarf galaxies are devoid of gas (with limits typically <105 M ⊙). Beyond the virial radii of the Milky Way and M31, the majority of the dwarf galaxies have detected H i gas and H i masses higher than the limits. When the relationship between gas content and distance is investigated using a Local Group virial radius, more of the nondetected dwarf galaxies are within this radius (85 $\pm$ 1 of the 93 nondetected dwarf galaxies) than within the virial radii of the Milky Way and M31. Using the Gaia proper-motion measurements available for 38 dwarf galaxies, the minimum gas density required to completely strip them of gas is calculated. Halo densities between 10−5 and 5 × 10−4 cm−3 are typically required for instantaneous stripping at perigalacticon. When compared to halo density with radius expectations from simulations and observations, 80\% of the dwarf galaxies with proper motions are consistent with being stripped by ram pressure at Milky Way pericenter. The results suggest that a diffuse gaseous galactic halo medium is important in quenching dwarf galaxies, and that a Local Group medium also potentially plays a role.},

	abstract = {We present new radial velocity (RV) measurements of old (horizontal branch) and intermediate-age (red clump) stellar tracers in the Carina dwarf spheroidal. They are based on more than 2200 low-resolution spectra collected with VIMOS at Very Large Telescope (VLT). The targets are faint (20 ≲ V ≲ 21.5 mag), but the accuracy at the faintest limit is ≤9 km s−1. These data were complemented with RV measurements either based on spectra collected with FORS2 and FLAMES/GIRAFFE at VLT or available in the literature. We ended up with a sample of 2748 stars and among them, 1389 are candidate Carina stars. We found that the intermediate-age stellar component shows a well-defined rotational pattern around the minor axis. The western and the eastern side of the galaxy differ by +5 and −4 km s−1 when compared with the main RV peak. The old stellar component is characterized by a larger RV dispersion and does not show evidence of the RV pattern. We compared the observed RV distribution with N-body simulations for a former disky dwarf galaxy orbiting a giant Milky Way--like galaxy. We rotated the simulated galaxy by 60$\,^{\circ}$ with respect to the major axis, we kept the observer on the orbital plane of the dwarf and extracted a sample of stars similar to the observed one. Observed and predicted ratios across the central regions are in remarkable agreement. This evidence indicates that Carina was a disky dwarf galaxy that experienced several strong tidal interactions with the Milky Way. Owing to these interactions, Carina transformed from a disky to a prolate spheroid and the rotational velocity transformed into random motions.},

We combine proper motions (PMs) from the Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) and line-of-sight velocities (vlos) from the literature to derive their 3D internal kinematics and to study the presence of internal velocity gradients. We find velocity gradients along the line-of-sight for Carina, Draco, Fornax, and Ursa Minor, at ≥1σ level of significance. The value of such gradients appears to be related to the orbital history of the dwarfs, indicating that the interaction with the MW is causing them. Dwarfs that are close to the MW and moving towards their orbits pericentres show, on average, larger velocity gradients. On the other hand, dwarfs that have recently left their orbits pericentres show no significant gradients. Lastly, dwarfs located at large Galactocentric distances show gradients with an intermediate intensity. Our results would indicate that the torque caused by the strong tidal forces exerted by the MW induces a strong velocity gradient when the dwarfs approach their orbits pericentres. During the pericentre passage, the rapid change in the forces direction would disrupt such gradient, which may steadily recover as the galaxies recede. We assess our findings by analysing dwarfs satellites from the TNG50 simulation. We find a significant increase in the intensity of the detected gradients as the satellites approach their pericentre, followed by a sharp drop as they abandon it, supporting our results for the dSphs of the MW.}",

@article{Bullock2017,
	abstract = { The dark energy plus cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmological model has been a demonstrably successful framework for predicting and explaining the large-scale structure of the Universe and its evolution with time. Yet on length scales smaller than ∼1 Mpc and mass scales smaller than ∼1011M⊙, the theory faces a number of challenges. For example, the observed cores of many dark matter--dominated galaxies are both less dense and less cuspy than na{\"\i}vely predicted in ΛCDM. The number of small galaxies and dwarf satellites in the Local Group is also far below the predicted count of low-mass dark matter halos and subhalos within similar volumes. These issues underlie the most well-documented problems with ΛCDM: cusp/core, missing satellites, and too-big-to-fail. The key question is whether a better understanding of baryon physics, dark matter physics, or both is required to meet these challenges. Other anomalies, including the observed planar and orbital configurations of Local Group satellites and the tight baryonic/dark matter scaling relations obeyed by the galaxy population, have been less thoroughly explored in the context of ΛCDM theory. Future surveys to discover faint, distant dwarf galaxies and to precisely measure their masses and density structure hold promising avenues for testing possible solutions to the small-scale challenges going forward. Observational programs to constrain or discover and characterize the number of truly dark low-mass halos are among the most important, and achievable, goals in this field over the next decade. These efforts will either further verify the ΛCDM paradigm or demand a substantial revision in our understanding of the nature of dark matter. },

@article{Kazantzidis2013,
	abstract = {According to the tidal stirring model, late type, rotationally supported dwarfs resembling present day dwarf irregular (dIrr) galaxies can transform into dwarf spheroidals (dSphs) via interactions with Milky-Way-sized hosts. We perform collisionless N-body simulations to investigate for the first time how tidal stirring depends on the dark matter (DM) density distribution in the central stellar region of the progenitor disky dwarf. Specifically, we explore various asymptotic inner slopes γ of the dwarf DM density profiles (ρ∝r−γ). For a given orbit inside the primary galaxy, rotationally supported dwarfs embedded in DM halos with core-like distributions (γ = 0.2) and mild density cusps (γ = 0.6) demonstrate a substantially enhanced likelihood and efficiency of transformation into dSphs compared to their counterparts with steeper DM density profiles (γ = 1). Such shallow DM distributions are akin to those of observed dIrrs highlighting tidal stirring as a plausible model for the Local Group (LG) morphology--density relation. When γ &lt; 1, a single pericentric passage can induce dSph formation and disky dwarfs on low-eccentricity or large-pericenter orbits are able to transform; these new results allow tidal stirring to explain virtually all known dSphs across a wide range of distances from their hosts. A subset of disky dwarfs initially embedded in DM halos with shallow density profiles are eventually disrupted by the primary; those that survive as dSphs are generally on orbits with lower eccentricities and/or larger pericenters compared to those of typical cold dark matter satellites. The latter could explain the peculiar orbits of several LG dSphs such as Fornax, Leo I, Tucana, and Cetus.},

These merger trees are used to calculate the galaxy–galaxy merger rate as a function of descendant stellar mass, progenitor stellar mass ratio, and redshift. We demonstrate that the most appropriate definition for the mass ratio of a galaxy–galaxy merger consists in taking both progenitor masses at the time when the secondary progenitor reaches its maximum stellar mass. Additionally, we avoid effects from ‘orphaned’ galaxies by allowing some objects to ‘skip’ a snapshot when finding a descendant, and by only considering mergers which show a well-defined ‘infall’ moment. Adopting these definitions, we obtain well-converged predictions for the galaxy–galaxy merger rate with the following main features, which are qualitatively similar to the halo–halo merger rate except for the last one: a strong correlation with redshift that evolves as ∼(1 + z)2.4–2.8, a power law with respect to mass ratio, and an increasing dependence on descendant stellar mass, which steepens significantly for descendant stellar masses greater than ∼2 × 1011 M⊙. These trends are consistent with observational constraints for medium-sized galaxies (M* ≳ 1010 M⊙), but in tension with some recent observations of the close pair fraction for massive galaxies (M* ≳ 1011 M⊙), which report a nearly constant or decreasing evolution with redshift. Finally, we provide a fitting function for the galaxy–galaxy merger rate which is accurate over a wide range of stellar masses, progenitor mass ratios, and redshifts.}",
