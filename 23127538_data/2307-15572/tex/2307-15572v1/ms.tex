\begin{abstract}
\textit{Ab initio} calculations for nuclei and nuclear matter are limited by the computational requirements of processing large data objects.
In this work, we develop low-rank singular value decompositions for chiral three-nucleon interactions, which dominate these limitations.
In order to handle the large dimensions in representing three-body operators, we use randomized decomposition techniques.
We study in detail the sensitivity of different three-nucleon topologies to low-rank matrix factorizations.
The developed low-rank three-nucleon interactions are benchmarked in Faddeev calculations of the triton and \ai{} calculations of medium-mass nuclei.
Exploiting low-rank properties of nuclear interactions will be particularly important for the extension of \ai{} studies to heavier and deformed systems, where storage requirements will exceed the computational capacities of the most advanced high-performance-computing facilities.

\paragraph{Introduction.--} 
What is the most efficient way to formulate and solve the quantum many-body problem?
This question lies at the heart of many-body theory and impacts areas ranging from atomic physics, condensed matter physics, nuclear physics, and quantum chemistry.
In the last decade, the \ai{} description of nuclei has witnessed remarkable progress~\cite{Hebe15ARNPS,Herg20review,Hebe203NF}. Nowadays up to hundred interacting particles and beyond can be targeted in first principles simulations~\cite{Morr17Tin,Miyagi2021,Arthuis2020a,Hu22Pb,Hebeler2022jacno}.
This great success is due to i) the development of high-precision nuclear interactions based on chiral effective field theory~\cite{Ente20Frontier,Epel19nuclfFront,Hebe203NF,Hebe11fits,Jian20N2LOGO}, and ii) the use of many-body expansion methods that build upon a suitably chosen $A$-body reference state~\cite{Herg20review}. Here the most commonly used approaches are many-body perturbation theory (MBPT)~\cite{Holt14Ca,Tich16HFMBPT,Tichai18BMBPT,Tichai2020review}, self-consistent Green's function theory~\cite{Dick04PPNP,Soma14GGF2N3N,Soma20SCGF,Barbieri2021}, coupled-cluster theory~\cite{Hage14RPP,Bind14CCheavy,Novario2020a}, and the in-medium
similarity renormalization group (IMSRG) approach~\cite{Herg16PR,Stroberg2019,Stroberg2021,Heinz2021}.
All these many-body frameworks have the great benefit of polynomial computational scaling with system size, thus circumventing the computational limitations of variational frameworks such as large-scale diagonalizations from configuration interaction approaches~\cite{Barr13PPNP} or real-space methods such as Quantum Monte Carlo~\cite{Carl15RMP}.


The fundamental microscopic input of basis expansion methods are matrix elements of second-quantized many-body operators, such as nuclear Hamiltonians, while the computational complexity of these methods is directly connected to the dimension of the matrices~\cite{Tichai2019pre}.
Memory requirements quickly become prohibitive when the size of the computational basis is increased and/or symmetries are dynamically broken, \eg{}, rotational invariance in open-shell systems, admitting for deformations~\cite{Novario2020a,Frosini2021mrI,Frosini2021mrII,Frosini2021mrIII,Hagen2022PCC,Yuan2022}.
Furthermore, the extension to heavier systems requires basis sizes that at some point become intractable -- in particular when handling three-nucleon (3N) forces, which are mandatory to provide a quantitative description of nuclear systems~\cite{Hamm13RMP,Hebe15ARNPS}.
Therefore, extending the range of nuclear \ai{} calculations to heavier (see Refs.~\cite{Miyagi2021,Hu22Pb,Hebeler2022jacno}) and exotic systems naturally requires the treatment of prohibitively large data objects.

In other areas of quantum many-body research it has been known for a long time that the complexity of the many-body problem can be significantly lowered by optimizing the representation of the underlying data objects by performing a so-called tensor factorization, \ie{}, a rewriting of complex high-dimensional objects as a sum/product of objects with lower dimension~\cite{Kolda2009}.
Factorizations are at the heart of tensor-network theories like the density matrix renormalization group that fundamentally build upon a factorized wave-function ansatz (see Refs.~\cite{White1992,Schollwoeck2011,Baiardi2020}) and have been successfully applied in nuclear structure calculations~\cite{Papenbrock2005,Legeza2015,Foss17TetraN,Tichai2022dmrg}.
Moreover, various traditional correlation expansions have been revisited in the context of factorization techniques (see Refs.~\cite{Kinoshita2003,Hohenstein2013,Schutski2017,Parrish2019,Lesiuk2021} for electronic structure applications). While the application of these methods to nuclear physics is only at its infancy, it provides a long-term perspective to various challenges in nuclear many-body physics.

In previous studies it was shown that state-of-the-art chiral nucleon-nucleon (\NN{}) interactions admit for excellent low-rank approximations by employing a singular-value decomposition (SVD) on the momentum-space matrix elements~\cite{Tich21SVDNN,Zhu21SVD}.
Such low-rank interactions provide an accurate description of nuclear observables in various applications ranging from two-nucleon phase shifts to infinite nuclear matter calculations and ground-state observables in medium-mass nuclei~\cite{Tich21SVDNN}.
Moreover, it was recently shown in the case of two-nucleon scattering that the underlying equations can be solved in terms of the decomposition factors themselves without reconstructing the original matrix~\cite{Tichai2022svdlse}.
In a complementary way, random embeddings of nuclear two-body operators have been used to sample perturbative estimates of the correlation energies of closed-shell nuclei~\cite{Zare2022jle}.

In this work, we develop low-rank approximations for 3N forces.
By using scalable randomized linear-algebra solvers we are able to cope with the substantially increased dimension size where traditional decomposition algorithms are no longer practical.
With factorized 3N forces at hand, we benchmark the impact of the decomposition on nuclear few- and many-body systems.
Our results clearly promote the use of alternative more efficient storage formats of nuclear many-body operators.

\paragraph{Randomized matrix decompositions.--}
In the following we employ the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the 3N potential (in a basis $V_\NNN \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times N}$)
\begin{align}
    V_\NNN = L \Sigma  R^T \, ,
\end{align}
where $L\, (R)$ denotes the unitary left (right) matrix of singular vectors and $\Sigma$ is a diagonal matrix containing the non-negative singular values $s_i$ ordered in decreasing size.

While the conventional factorization of large matrices is a computationally intensive task, there have been complementary ideas to lower the complexity by introducing a probabilistic component to the algorithm as proposed by Halko \textit{et al.}~\cite{Halko2011}.
The underlying scheme defines the computational foundation for this study. A schematic representation of the randomized SVD (rSVD) algorithm is displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:rsvd-scheme}.
In the first step a random projection matrix $P \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times l}$ is applied to the initial matrix $V$ yielding a matrix $Z=VP$ of much smaller size than $V$ -- in particular for low-rank matrices with $l\ll N$. 
Subsequently, an orthonormal basis of $Z$ is obtained by performing a QR decomposition $Z=QX$ (step 1).
The initial matrix $V$ is then projected to a smaller space using the low-rank basis $Y=Q^T V$.
Performing a thin SVD of the projected matrix yields $Y = L_Y \Sigma R^T$ (step 2). 
The left SVD component $L$ of the full decomposition is obtained by final left multiplication with $Q$, \ie{}, $L= Q L_Y$ (step 3).
In practice the number $l$ is chosen slightly larger than the desired rank $\RSVD$. The difference $p = l- \RSVD$ is termed oversampling parameter and stabilizes the computation. In our applications a value of $p=5$ is chosen.
We have implemented the rSVD algorithm using the \texttt{Eigen} library~\cite{eigenweb}.

Once a decomposition has been obtained, the computational gain of the decomposition is quantified in terms of the compression ratio
\begin{align}
    \compression{N}{\RSVD} \equiv \frac{N^2}{2 N \RSVD + \RSVD} \, ,
\end{align}
where $N$ denotes the matrix dimension and $\RSVD$ the SVD-rank of the decomposition, \ie{}, the number of singular values kept.
The quantity \compression{N}{\RSVD} quantifies the memory savings of a rank-$\RSVD$ approximation over its original full-rank starting point of a square matrix with linear dimension $N$.
Since in the following we compare decompositions between matrices of different dimension, it is useful to introduce the relative SVD-rank $\RSVDpercent \equiv 100 \cdot \RSVD/N$.
This is closely related to the compression ratio such that $\RSVDpercent=1.0$ corresponds to $C\approx100$ and $\RSVDpercent=0.1$ to $C\approx1000$.

\paragraph{Low-rank interactions.--} In practice the rSVD is applied to the partial-wave-decomposed momentum-space matrix elements of 3N interactions
\begin{align}
    \la pq; \alpha | \tilde V_{\NNN} | p'q'; \alpha' \ra \, ,
    \label{eq:v3n}
\end{align}
where $p,q$ ($p',q'$) denote the three-body bra (ket) Jacobi momenta and the collective index $\alpha = \{ [(LS)J (ls)j]\mathcal{J} M_\mathcal{J} (Tt)\mathcal{T}M_\mathcal{T} \}$ gathers all quantum numbers of the three-body state.
Since the three-body matrix elements depend on four Jacobi momenta, bra and ket states are organized into collective indices $(pq)=I$ and $(p'q')=I'$ such that a matrix-like object $M_{II'}^{\alpha\alpha'}$ is obtained from the initial $M_{pqp'q'}^{\alpha\alpha'}$.

For the partial-wave decomposition, angular-momentum eigenstates are obtained by coupling angular momenta of the first two particles to a two-body subsystem with quantum numbers $L$, $S$, $J$, which are subsequently coupled with the angular momenta of the third particle to obtain the three-body quantum numbers $\mathcal{J}$ and $\mathcal{T}$.
We emphasize that by working in a symmetry-adapted basis, we maintain rotational invariance and parity/isospin conservation in the factorization, \ie{}, $[\tilde V_{\NNN}, \mathcal{J}^2] = [\tilde V_{\NNN}, \mathcal{J}_z] =[\tilde V_{\NNN}, \Pi] =  [\tilde V_{\NNN}, \mathcal{T}^2] =  [\tilde V_{\NNN}, \mathcal{T}_z] = 0 \,$.
Finally, a basis transformation mediated by a unitary matrix $U$ can be very efficiently performed starting from an initial SVD format, since the matrix multiplication $\bar V_{\NNN} \equiv U^\dagger V_{\NNN} U$ can be executed by operating only on the (thin) $L$ and $R^\dagger$ components of $V_{\NNN}$. This can enable speedups in the transformation that generates single-particle matrix elements used in medium-mass calculations.

In the following, the partial-wave 3N matrix elements from Eq.~\eqref{eq:v3n} are taken as input for an rSVD solver.
For the discretization of the momentum mesh we use $N_p = N_q = 15$ points for both Jacobi momenta.
Intermediate two-body quantum numbers are included up to $J_\text{max}=8$.
Partial waves are characterized by their three-body quantum numbers $\JPT$.
To account for the varying matrix dimension in different partial-wave channels the number of singular values is provided relative to the full dimension.

Figure~\ref{fig:svals} displays the singular values of chiral 3N interactions.
Panel (a) shows the individual unregularized \nxlo{2} operator topologies in the triton channel, \ie{}, $\JPT=\frac{1}{2}^+\frac{1}{2}$, with the corresponding low-energy constants (LECs) set to unity in their respective natural units (see Ref.~\cite{Hebe203NF}).
We observe a clear difference between the set of long-range pion-exchange topologies $\{c_1,c_3,c_4\}$ that have a much slower falloff compared to the set $\{c_D,c_E\}$ that encode mid- and short-range contributions.
Still all topologies exhibit a strong suppression at very low ranks ($\lesssim 0.25 \, \%$) followed by a transition to a declining plateau-like region.
Even for the long-range topologies the size of the singular values is suppressed to less than $s_i \approx2\times 10^{-3}$ for the smallest $99 \%$. 
In particular in the case of the $c_E$ term all singular values are smaller than $10^{-15}$ except the largest one which is of the order ten.

In panel (b) we include non-local regulators $f_{\LamNNN}(p,q) = \exp[ - ((p^2 + \frac{3}{4} q^2)/\LamNNN)^4]$, where $\LamNNN$ denotes the three-body cutoff here set to $\LamNNN=2.0\, \fmi$. The regularized matrix elements induce a stronger suppression of the singular value spectrum for all operator topologies.
Similar findings as for \nxlo{2} are found at subleading orders [panel (c) for \nxlo{3}]: long-range multi-pion exchange topologies are more strongly suppressed compared to the short-range relativistic corrections. In general the \nxlo{3} terms have larger leading singular values and slower falloff in most cases.
Finally we show realistic chiral 3N forces (obtained after multiplication with the corresponding LEC values) in panel (d) for the 3N part of the ``1.8/2.0" interaction~\cite{Hebe11fits} with $\LamNNN = 2.0\, \fm^{-1}$ and in panel (e) for the 3N part of the ``EMN450" interaction~\cite{Dris17MCshort} with $\LamNNN = 500\,$MeV.

In general the regularization yields a stronger suppression of singular values, while this effect is more pronounced for smaller cutoff $\LamNNN$. 
Furthermore, a comparison with the individual operator topologies in panels (a) and (c) indicates that the singular spectrum is dictated by the dominating topology.
The slow falloff of the \nxlo{3} two-pion-exchange contributions yields a slower suppression of singular values in the case of the ``EMN450'' interaction.
For the full interactions we additionally investigate different partial-wave channels by varying angular momentum, parity, and isospin.
We note that the matrix dimensions among partial-wave channels differ significantly ($N=7650$ for $\JPT=\frac{1}{2}^+ \frac{3}{2}$ up to $N=40050$ for $\JPT = \frac{5}{2}^+\frac{1}{2}$).
As a general trend, higher partial-wave channels with larger $\mathcal{J}$ values show a slower falloff while their largest singular value is significantly smaller compared to, \eg{}, the triton channel.
To gauge the low-rank character of higher partial-wave channels, we will explore many-body calculations later.

\paragraph{Triton calculations.--}
A first benchmark for low-rank interactions is provided by the solution of the three-body problem for the ground-state energy and point-proton radius of the triton, using a Faddeev code in partial-wave-decomposed form~\cite{Stadler1991faddeev}.
Figure~\ref{fig:triton} provides an overview of the relative error on the ground-state energy (top), expectation value of the \NNN{} force (middle), and point-proton radius (bottom) as a function of decomposition rank for the ``1.8/2.0'' and ``EMN450'' interactions.
Similar to Fig.~\ref{fig:svals} we study the impact on the final observables by keeping up to $1\,\%$ of the leading singular values in the decomposition.
In the Faddeev calculation, we incorporate the full-rank \NN{} potential since we want to study the sensitivity to the low-rank properties of the \NNN{} force.
Since both interactions have been fitted to the triton binding energy, our full-rank calculations reproduce the experimental value of $E_\text{gs}(\elem{3}{H})$.
However, the individual size of the \NNN{} contribution is different among the interactions used, with $\la V_\NNN{} \ra_{1.8/2.0} = 0.19 \, \MeV$ and
$\la V_\NNN{} \ra_{\text{EMN}450} = 0.67\, \MeV$, respectively.
Consequently, we expect higher sensitivity in the case of the ``EMN450'' interaction in the following.

At low ranks ($\leq 0.5 \, \%$), the ``EMN450'' interaction yields consistently larger errors for all observables. This is in agreement with the slower falloff in the triton channel as observed in Fig.~\ref{fig:svals}.
Still, in all cases keeping the leading $1\, \%$ of singular values yields an excellent reproduction of ground-state properties with absolute differences of $10^{-4} \, \MeV$ ($\fm$) for the binding energy (point-proton radius).
In general the point-proton radius is less sensitive to the decomposition of the 3N forces since the 3N contribution is approximately $0.7 \% \,(6.4 \%)$ for the ``1.8/2.0'' (``EMN450'') interaction.
Few-body calculations thus allow for data compression of more than two orders of magnitude without significant loss in accuracy.

\paragraph{Medium-mass nuclei.--}
To test the performance of low-rank \NNN{} interactions for nuclei, we transform the matrix elements to a bound-state harmonic-oscillator basis.
Subsequently, we solve the Hartree-Fock equations with NN+3N interactions, thus obtaining an energetically optimized reference state. Using normal ordering, the resulting zero-, one-, and two-body parts of the intrinsic Hamiltonian define the starting point for an IMSRG calculation that non-perturbatively accounts for particle-hole correlations~\cite{Herg16PR}.
Many-body operators beyond the normal-ordered two-body level are discarded yielding the IMSRG(2) approximation that provides the current IMSRG workhorse in \ai{} nuclear structure calculations.
Other observables are evaluated by a final transformation of the associated operators using the Magnus approach~\cite{Morr15Magnus}.
In addition, second-order MBPT results ($E_{\text{MP2}}$) are shown as a simpler estimate for the correlation energy.
Calculations are performed using the publicly available IMSRG solver by Stroberg~\cite{Stro17imsrggit}.

As a benchmark we compare the ground-state energy and charge radii of selected closed-shell nuclei ranging from $^{16}$O to $^{132}$Sn with the developed low-rank 3N interactions.
All calculations employ 3N matrix elements with $E_{3\text{max}}=24$~\cite{Miyagi2021}, generated with the \texttt{NuHamil} code~\cite{Miyagi2023}.
Figure~\ref{fig:midmass} shows the relative error on the ground-state energy keeping $\RSVDpercent = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 1.0 \, \%$ of the leading singular values.
We observe in all cases that the impact of the SVD error is slightly larger at HF level compared to the MP2 and IMSRG(2) results.
For both ground-state energies and charge radii there is a systematic decrease of the relative error as a function of \RSVDpercent{}, although the dependence is non-monotonic.
Still, in all cases the relative error is well below $0.1\%$.
Moreover, a systematic increase of the relative error as a function of mass number is evident.
Since this trend is already present at the HF level, we attribute the increase in error to the enlarged hole-space in heavier systems and, thus, an enhanced accumulation of errors from individual matrix elements. The error on the correlation energy itself, both at the MP2 and IMSRG(2) level, does not increase in heavier systems.
Even for the heaviest systems, the SVD error is only at the few hundred keV level.

\paragraph{Summary and outlook.--} We have developed factorization techniques to chiral 3N forces. We have clearly identified low-rank patterns in the momentum-space representation of 3N interactions yielding an efficient compression from randomized matrix-decomposition techniques.
In our few- and many-body benchmarks low-rank 3N interactions provide an excellent approximation for energies and radii, thus paving the way for new efficient data representations of large many-body operators.
The memory savings that can be anticipated from our findings exceed a factor of $\compression{}{}=100$ at negligible approximation error on few- and many-body observables.

While the decomposition of many-body operators constitutes a natural first step, computational benefits in many-body applications require the reformulation of the many-body framework in terms of the decomposition factors themselves.
The design of a factorized Faddeev solver is a natural starting point to more carefully investigate how to best exploit low-rank operators in nuclear few-body applications.
Once transferred to the many-body sector, factorization techniques may open up a way to overcome the many-body truncations when including deformation or three-body operators~\cite{Heinz2021,Novario2020a}.
