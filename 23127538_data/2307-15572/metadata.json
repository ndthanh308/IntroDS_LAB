  "abstract": "First-principles simulations of many-fermion systems are commonly limited by the computational requirements of processing large data objects. As a remedy, we propose the use of low-rank approximations of three-body interactions, which are the dominant such limitation in nuclear physics. We introduce a novel randomized decomposition technique to handle the excessively large matrix dimensions and study the sensitivity of low-rank properties to interaction details. The developed low-rank three-nucleon interactions are benchmarked in ab initio simulations of few- and many-body systems. Exploiting low-rank properties provides a promising route to extend the microscopic description of atomic nuclei to large systems where storage requirements exceed the computational capacities of the most advanced high-performance computing facilities.",
