  "abstract": "Let $(S, \\n)$ be a commutative noetherian local ring and $ω\\in\\n$ be non-zerodivisor. This paper deals with the behavior of the category $\\mon(ω, \\cp)$ consisting of all monomorphisms between finitely generated projective $S$-modules with cokernels annihilated by $ω$. We introduce a homotopy category $\\HT\\mon(ω, \\cp)$, which is shown to be triangulated. It is proved that this homotopy category embeds into the singularity category of the factor ring $R=S/{(ω)}$. As an application, not only the existence of almost split sequences {ending at indecomposable non-projective objects of} $\\mon(ω, \\cp)$ is proven, but also the Auslander-Reiten translation, $τ_{\\mon}(-)$, is completely recognized. Particularly, it will be observed that any non-projective object of $\\mon(ω, \\cp)$ with local endomorphism ring is invariant under the square of the Auslander-Reiten translation.",
