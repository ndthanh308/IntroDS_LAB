  "abstract": "Lattice simulations are an important class of problems in crystalline solids, surface science, alloys, adsorption, absorption, separation, catalysis, to name a few. We describe a fast computational method for performing lattice thermodynamic calculations that is based on the use of the reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) technique and multiple short-range order (SRO) parameters. The approach is comparable in accuracy to the Metropolis Monte Carlo (MC) method. The equilibrium configuration is determined in 5-10 Newton-Raphson iterations by solving a system of coupled nonlinear algebraic flux equations. This makes the RMC-based method computationally more efficient than MC, given that MC typically requires sampling of millions of configurations. The technique is applied to the interacting 2D adsorption problem. Unlike grand canonical MC, RMC is found to be adept at tackling geometric frustration, as it is able to quickly and correctly provide the ordered c(2x2) adlayer configuration for Cl adsorbed on a Cu (100) surface.",
