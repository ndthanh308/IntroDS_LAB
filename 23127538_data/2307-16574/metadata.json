  "abstract": "Controlled quantum teleportation (CQT) can be considered as a variant of quantum teleportation in which three parties are involved where one party acts as the controller. The usability of the CQT scheme depends on two types of fidelities viz. conditioned fidelity and non-conditioned fidelity. The difference between these fidelities may be termed as power of the controller and it plays a vital role in the CQT scheme. Thus, our aim is to estimate the power of the controller in such a way so that its estimated value can be obtained in an experiment. To achieve our goal, we have constructed a witness operator and have shown that its expected value may be used in the estimation of the lower bound of the power of the controller. Furthermore, we have shown that it is possible to make the standard W state useful in the CQT scheme if one of its qubits either passes through the amplitude damping channel or the phase damping channel. We have also shown that the phase damping channel performs better than the amplitude damping channel in the sense of generating more power of the controller in the CQT scheme.",
