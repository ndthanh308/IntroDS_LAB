  "abstract": "We consider the Cauchy problems in the whole space for wave equations with higher derivative terms. We derive sharp growth estimates of the $L^2$-norm of the solution itself in the case of the space 1, 2 dimensions. By imposing the weighted $L^1$-initial velocity, we can get the lower and upper bound estimates of the solution itself. In three or more dimensions, we observe that the $L^2$-growth behavior of the solution never occurs in the ($L^2 \\cap L^1$)-framework of the initial data.",
