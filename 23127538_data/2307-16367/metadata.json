  "abstract": "In recent decades, computer experiments have led to an accurate and fundamental understanding of atomic and molecular mechanisms in fluids, such as different kinds of relaxation processes toward steady physical states. In this paper, we investigate how exactly the configuration of initial states in a molecular-dynamics simulation can affect the rates of decay toward equilibrium for the widely-known Langevin canonical ensemble. For this purpose, we derive an original expression relating the system relaxation time τ_{sys} and the radial distribution function g(r) in the near-zero and high-density limit. We found that for an initial state which is slightly marginally inhomogeneous in the number density of atoms, the system relaxation time τ_{sys} is much longer than that for the homogeneous case and an increasing function of the Langevin coupling constant, γ. We also found during structural equilibration, g(r) at large distances approaches 1 from above for the inhomogeneous case and from below for the macroscopically homogeneous one.",
