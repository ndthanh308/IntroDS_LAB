\begin{abstract}\
DAG (directed acyclic graph) tasks are widely used to model parallel real-time workload.
The real-time performance of a DAG task not only depends on its total workload, but also its graph structure. Intuitively, with the same
total workload, a DAG task with looser precedence constraints tends to have better real-time performance in terms of worst-case response time.
However, this paper shows that actually we can shorten the worst-case response time of a DAG task by carefully adding new edges and constructing longer paths.
We develop techniques based on the state-of-the-art DAG response time analysis techniques to properly add new edges so that the worst-case response time bound guaranteed by formal analysis can be significantly reduced.
Experiments under different parameter settings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, through exploring the dependencies between vertices, we propose a method of adding edges and thus making longer paths in DAG tasks to optimize the worst-case response time bound.
We also apply the proposed techniques to the scheduling of multiple DAG tasks.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, reducing the worst-case response time bound by 21.6\% and improving the system schedulability by 22.2\% on average.
