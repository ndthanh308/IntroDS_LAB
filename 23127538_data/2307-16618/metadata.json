  "abstract": "The intact transfer and assembly of two-dimensional (2D) materials and their heterostructures are critical for their integration into advanced electronic and optical devices. Herein, we report a facile technique called volatile polymer stamping (VPS) to achieve efficient transfer of 2D materials and assembly of large-scale heterojunctions with clean interfaces. The central feature of the VPS technique is the use of volatile polyphthalaldehyde (PPA) together with hydrophobic polystyrene (PS). While PS enables the direct delamination of 2D materials from hydrophilic substrates owing to water intercalation, PPA can protect 2D materials from solution attack and maintain their integrity during PS removal. Thereafter, PPA can be completely removed by thermal annealing at 180 °C. The proposed VPS technique overcomes the limitations of currently used transfer techniques, such as chemical etching during the delamination stage, solution tearing during cleaning, and contamination from polymer residues.",
