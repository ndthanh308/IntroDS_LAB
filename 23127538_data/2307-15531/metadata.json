  "abstract": "The collected data of IceCube, a cubic kilometre neutrino detector array in the Antarctic ice, reveal a diffuse flux of astrophysical neutrinos. The extragalactic sources of the majority of these neutrinos however have yet to be discovered. Tidal Disruption Events (TDEs), disruption outbursts from black holes that accrete at an enhanced rate, are candidates for being the sources of extragalactic, high-energy neutrinos. Stein et al. (2021) and Reusch et al. (2022) have reported the coincidence of two likely TDEs from supermassive black holes and public IceCube neutrino events (alerts). Further work by van Velzen et al. (2021) identified a third event in coincidence with a high-energy neutrino alert and a $3.7 σ$ correlation between a broader set of similar TDE-like flares and IceCube alerts. We conducted a stacking analysis with a 29-flare subset of the TDE-like flares tested by van Velzen et al. This work was done with neutrinos with energies above $\\mathcal{O}(100)$ GeV. The resulting p-value of 0.45 is consistent with background. In this contribution, I will discuss the results of the stacking analysis, as well as the impact of using different reconstruction algorithms on the three correlated realtime alerts.",
