In this paper we proposed a synthetic speech detector based on a deep learning approach that fuses and harmonizes three feature sets proposed in the literature. The combination strategy is able to manage the different dimensionalities and mitigate some detection inefficiencies allowing to outperform networks trained independently on the single feature sets.
Furthermore, the proposed approach proved to generalize well on different datasets and achieved higher robustness with respect to anti-forensic attacks/conditions such as MP3 compression and Gaussian noise injection.
Future works will be dedicated to designing better feature fusion strategies by using more complex deep learning strategies, e.g., attention-based architectures that focus on specific audio excerpts that prove to be more discriminative information.
