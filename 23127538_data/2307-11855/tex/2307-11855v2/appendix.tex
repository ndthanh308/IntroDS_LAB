\section{Statistical test for run time comparison}

In this section we present the results of the statistical test. For each algorithm, we use one box plot to show the distribution of independent runs for $n = 100$. Each box is the first quartile ($Q1$) to the third quartile ($Q3$) of the group. The whiskers extend the box by $1.5$ times the interquartile range ($IQR$). Dots are outliers which pass whiskers.

For the other set up $n = 20$, we get a similar box plot.
