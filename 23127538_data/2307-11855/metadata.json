  "abstract": "While most theoretical run time analyses of discrete randomized search heuristics focused on finite search spaces, we consider the search space $\\mathbb{Z}^n$. This is a further generalization of the search space of multi-valued decision variables $\\{0,\\ldots,r-1\\}^n$.\n  We consider as fitness functions the distance to the (unique) non-zero optimum $a$ (based on the $L_1$-metric) and the \\ooea which mutates by applying a step-operator on each component that is determined to be varied. For changing by $\\pm 1$, we show that the expected optimization time is $Θ(n \\cdot (|a|_{\\infty} + \\log(|a|_H)))$. In particular, the time is linear in the maximum value of the optimum $a$. Employing a different step operator which chooses a step size from a distribution so heavy-tailed that the expectation is infinite, we get an optimization time of $O(n \\cdot \\log^2 (|a|_1) \\cdot \\left(\\log (\\log (|a|_1))\\right)^{1 + ε})$.\n  Furthermore, we show that RLS with step size adaptation achieves an optimization time of $Θ(n \\cdot \\log(|a|_1))$.\n  We conclude with an empirical analysis, comparing the above algorithms also with a variant of CMA-ES for discrete search spaces.",
