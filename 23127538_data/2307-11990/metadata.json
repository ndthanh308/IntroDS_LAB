  "abstract": "In the paper, some special linear combinations of the terms of rational cycles of generalized Collatz sequences are studied. It is proved that if the coefficients of the linear combinations satisfy some conditions then these linear combinations are integers. The discussed results are demonstrated on some examples. In some particular cases the obtained results can be used to explain some patterns of digits in $p$-adic representations of the terms of the rational cycles.",
