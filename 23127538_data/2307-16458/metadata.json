  "abstract": "We examine the anisotropy originated from a first-order vacuum phase transitions through three-dimensional numerical simulations. We apply Bianchi Type-I metric to our model that has one scalar field minimally coupled to the gravity. We calculate the time evolution of the energy density for the shear scalar and the directional Hubble parameters as well as the power spectra for the scalar field and the gravitational radiation although there are a number of caveats for the tensor perturbations in Bianchi Type-I universe. We run simulations with different mass scales of the scalar field, therefore, in addition to investigation of anisotropy via the shear scalar, we also determine at which mass scale the phase transition completes successfully, hence, neglecting the expansion of the Universe does not significantly affect the results. Finally, we showed that such an event may contribute to the total anisotropy depending on the mass scale of the scalar field and the initial population of nucleated bubbles.",
