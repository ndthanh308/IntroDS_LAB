	abstract = {We define a model of quantum computation with local fermionic modes (LFMs)---sites which can be either empty or occupied by a fermion. With the standard correspondence between the Foch space of m LFMs and the Hilbert space of m qubits, simulation of one fermionic gate takes O(m) qubit gates and vice versa. We show that using different encodings, the simulation cost can be reduced to O(log m) and a constant, respectively. Nearest neighbors fermionic gates on a graph of bounded degree can be simulated at a constant cost. A universal set of fermionic gates is found. We also study computation with Majorana fermions which are basically halves of LFMs. Some connection to qubit quantum codes is made.},

The possibility of a phase transition characterized by a change in the response of the system to an external perturbation is discussed in the context of a mean field type of approximation. The critical behaviour found in this model displays very weak singularities. The application of these ideas to the xy model of magnetism, the solid-liquid transition, and the neutral superfluid are discussed. This type of phase transition cannot occur in a superconductor nor in a Heisenberg ferromagnet.}

abstract = {We study the potential of a static quark–anti-quark pair in the range 0.05 fm⩽r⩽0.8 fm, employing a sequence of lattices up to 644. Lattice artifacts in potential and force are investigated theoretically as well as numerically and continuum quantities are obtained by extrapolation of the results at finite lattice spacing. Consistency of the numerical results with the form of scaling violations predicted by an analysis à la Symanzik is found. The scale r0/a is determined for the Wilson action up to β=6.92.}

We found that, in the specific case of the three-dimensional Ising Model, methods of Metropolis are efficient. Studying the system near the point of phase transition, we observe that the magnetization goes to zero. In our simulations we analyzed the behavior of the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility to verify the phase transition in a paramagnetic to ferromagnetic material. The behavior of the magnetization and of the magnetic susceptibility as a function of the temperature suggest a phase transition around KT/J ≈ 4.5 and was evidenced the problem of finite size of the lattice to work with large lattice.},

Furthermore, we explore how the properties of METTS can reveal characteristic order and excitations of systems and discuss why METTS form an efficient basis for sampling. Finally, we explore the extent to which the average entanglement of a METTS ensemble is minimal.},

	abstract = {Various methods have been developed for the quantum computation of the ground and excited states of physical and chemical systems, but many of them require either large numbers of ancilla qubits or high-dimensional optimization in the presence of noise. The quantum imaginary-time evolution (QITE) and quantum Lanczos (QLanczos) methods proposed in Motta et al. (2020) eschew the aforementioned issues. In this study, we demonstrate the practical application of these algorithms to challenging quantum computations of relevance for chemistry and nuclear physics, using the deuteron-binding energy and molecular hydrogen binding and excited state energies as examples. With the correct choice of initial and final states, we show that the number of timesteps in QITE and QLanczos can be reduced significantly, which commensurately simplifies the required quantum circuit and improves compatibility with NISQ devices. We have performed these calculations on cloud-accessible IBM Q quantum computers. With the application of readout-error mitigation and Richardson error extrapolation, we have obtained ground and excited state energies that agree well with exact results obtained from diagonalization.},

abstract = {We present quantum algorithms for solving two problems regarding stochastic processes. The first algorithm prepares the thermal Gibbs state of a quantum system and runs in time almost linear in √Nβ/Z and polynomial in log(1/ε), where N is the Hilbert space dimension, β is the inverse temperature, Z is the partition function, and ε is the desired precision of the output state. Our quantum algorithm exponentially improves the complexity dependence on 1/ε and polynomially improves the dependence on β of known quantum algorithms for this problem. The second algorithm estimates the hitting time of a Markov chain. For a sparse stochastic matrix P, it runs in time almost linear in 1/(εΔ3/2), where ε is the absolute precision in the estimation and Δ is a parameter determined by P, and whose inverse is an upper bound of the hitting time. Our quantum algorithm quadratically improves the complexity dependence on 1/ε and 1/Δ of the analog classical algorithm for hitting-time estimation. Both algorithms use tools recently developed in the context of Hamiltonian simulation, spectral gap amplification, and solving linear systems of equations.},

	abstract = {The preparation of thermal equilibrium states is important for the simulation of condensed matter and cosmology systems using a quantum computer. We present a method to prepare such mixed states with unitary operators and demonstrate this technique experimentally using a gate-based quantum processor. Our method targets the generation of thermofield double states using a hybrid quantum-classical variational approach motivated by quantum-approximate optimization algorithms, without prior calculation of optimal variational parameters by numerical simulation. The fidelity of generated states to the thermal-equilibrium state smoothly varies from 99 to 75{\%} between infinite and near-zero simulated temperature, in quantitative agreement with numerical simulations of the noisy quantum processor with error parameters drawn from experiment.},
