\begin{abstract}
We consider the far-from-equilibrium quantum transport dynamics in a 1D Josephson junction chain of multi-mode Bose-Einstein condensates. We develop a theoretical model to examine the experiment of R.~Labouvie \textit{et al.} [Phys.~Rev.~Lett.~\textbf{115}, 050601 (2015)], wherein the phenomenon of negative differential conductivity (NDC) was reported in the refilling dynamics of an initially depleted site within the chain. We demonstrate that a unitary c-field description can quantitatively reproduce the experimental results over the full range of tunnel couplings, and requires no fitted parameters. With a view toward atomtronic implementations, we further demonstrate that the filling is strongly dependent on spatial phase variations stemming from quantum fluctuations. Our findings suggest that the interpretation of the device in terms of NDC is invalid outside of the weak coupling regime. Within this restricted regime, the device exhibits a hybrid behaviour of NDC and the AC Josephson effect. A simplified circuit model of the device will require an approach tailored to atomtronics that incorporates quantum fluctuations.

\emph{Introduction ---}  Experiments in ultracold atomic gases allow unprecedented control over the dynamics of quantum systems. Developments such as arbitrary potential generation~\cite{Gauthier2016} and single-site addressing schemes~\cite{Bakr2009,Wurtz2009,Edge2015}, have driven interest in the development of so-called ``atomtronic" systems, consisting of  circuits and devices that leverage quantum features such as coherence or superfluid transport~\cite{Seaman2007,Eckel2014,Olsen2015,Kordas2015,Caliga2017,Burchianti2018,Ryu2020,Amico2021,Pandey2021,Perez2022,Grun2022}. Atomtronic simulators have also proven a powerful platform for probing a diverse range of nonequilibrium phenomena in quantum many-body systems within a simplified setting, for example quench dynamics~\cite{Kinoshita2006,Hung2013,Pigneur2018,Chen2019}, universal scaling phenomena~\cite{Lamporesi2013,Krinner2015,Erne2018,Eigen2018}, and quantum turbulence~\cite{navon2016emergence,navon2019synthetic,reeves2022turbulent}. 


Atomtronic  systems  utilizing  optical  lattice  potentials are  particularly suited for simulating nonequilibrium transport phenomena as occurs, for example, in the dynamics of Josephson junctions~\cite{Burchianti2018,Labouvie2015,Labouvie2016,Ceulemans2023}.
In a recent experiment, Labouvie \textit{et al.}~\cite{Labouvie2015} studied a ``multimode" Josephson array, formed by loading a large prolate atomic BEC into a 1D optical lattice. The resulting Josephson array,  shown schematically in Fig.~\ref{fig:Schematic}(a),  consisted of a chain of quasi-2D Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs), harmonically confined radially in $r$, and coupled by nearest-neighbour hopping $J$ along $z$. Using a site-selective electron beam, the experiment removed the atoms from the central site, and then observed the subsequent refilling dynamics  [Fig.~\ref{fig:Schematic}(b)].

The main finding of Ref.~\cite{Labouvie2015} was the observation of a novel current-filling relation in the central site.  
Unlike the AC oscillations characteristic of a standard (two-mode) Josephson junction, the system exhibited an emergent DC current; as shown schematically in Fig.~\ref{fig:Schematic}(c), the atom current 
onto the central site, $I = dN_0/dt$, was ohmic at small biases ($\Omega$). Meanwhile, at large biases ($\mathcal{N}$), the junction exhibited the phenomenon of negative differential conductivity (NDC), wherein the current decreased with increasing ``chemical voltage" $\Delta \mu$:
\begin{equation}
d I/d(\Delta \mu) < 0 \quad\quad \mathrm{(NDC)}. \label{eq:NDC}
\end{equation}
The emergent NDC was shown to be enabled by an atom-number-dependent effective tunnelling rate, $J_{\rm{eff}}$, arising due to many radially excited modes altering the tunnelling dynamics~[Fig.~\ref{fig:Schematic}(b)]. 

NDC is widely utilized in traditional semiconductor electronics~\cite{Shaw1992_1}, and has more recently been observed in systems  such as molecular break junctions~\cite{Perrin2014}, and multi-layer graphene~\cite{Britnell2013}. 
The strongly non-ohmic behaviour of NDC thus presents interesting prospects for atomtronic systems;  its characteristic multi-valued current-voltage relation 
[cf.~Fig.~\ref{fig:Schematic}(c)] 
enables the construction of elements such as diodes, thyristors and transistors~\cite{Shaw1992_1}. Furthermore, the mechanisms leading to NDC are typically nonequilibrium (``hot-carrier") phenomena~\cite{Volkov1969,Pamplin1970}, and its observation in an atomtronic setting thus hints that additional far-from-equilibrium quantum transport scenarios may be realizable with
ultracold atoms. This, in turn, might provide new insights into nonequilibrium quantum transport more generally, as ultracold atom systems offer a means to study phenomena difficult to probe in detail in the solid state~\cite{Brantut2013,Chien2015}. While the average filling behaviour 
observed experimentally 
has been reproduced by effective few-mode models~\cite{Labouvie2015,Mink2022}, a more complete model of the many-body dynamics presents a considerable theoretical challenge, and, to date, this has precluded a comprehensive understanding of the atomtronic NDC mechanism.


 In this Letter we develop a numerically tractable model
 for the nonequilibrium transport dynamics in the multimode Josephson  chain. In contrast to previous effective single-particle or few-mode approximations \cite{Labouvie2015,Olsen2016,Fischer2017,Mink2022}, we build a model within the framework of classical field theory which fully captures the many-body and multimode nature of the problem. Not only does our approach yield quantitative agreement with the experimental obervations (without any fitted parameters), it further allows the underlying mechanisms of the reported NDC to be probed in detail. We are able to demonstrate that $i)$: the device current is in fact nowhere ohmic, and that this apparent behaviour is due to the probabilistic nature of the  refilling seeded by quantum fluctuations; $ii)$: the interpretation of the current relation in terms of NDC is severely limited by the importance of phase dynamics and the far-from equilibrium nature of the system; and $iii)$ the device displays a combination of NDC- and AC Josephson-type behaviour. An important implication of our results for atomtronics is that electronic analogues should be approached with caution, and that a tailored theoretical approach specific to atomtronic junctions is likely required. 


\emph{Model --- }
We model the multimode junction using c-field theory, also known as the truncated Wigner approximation (TWA) \cite{Steel1998,Polkovnikov2003a,Blakie2008}. Essentially, the TWA approximates the dynamics of the quantum system as a classical field (c-field), with quantum fluctuations accounted for at first order by adding a specified amount of noise to the initial conditions (for a review, see, e.g. Ref.~\cite{Blakie2008}).



We describe the system on each site $i$ using a stochastic classical field $\psi_i(\bm{x},t)$. The fields evolve according to coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations
\begin{align}
i \hbar \partial_t \psi_i = \mathcal{L}\psi_i + J (\psi_{i-1}  + \psi_{i+1}), \label{eq:gpe}
\end{align}
where 
\begin{align}
\mathcal{L}\psi_i = \mathcal{P}\left\{\left[- \frac{\hbar \nabla^2}{2m} +V(\bm{x}) + g_2 |\psi_i|^2   \right]\psi_i \right\} ,
\label{eqn:GPEoperator}
\end{align}
is the (projected) Gross-Pitaevski operator and 
$V(\bm{x}) = \frac{1}{2} m \omega_r^2 (x^2+y^2)$
provides harmonic confinement in the $x$-$y$ plane with frequency $\omega_r.$
The interaction strength is $g_2 = g \int dz |w(z)|^4 $, where  $w(z)$ is the Wannier function associated with the optical lattice in the $z$-direction and $g = 4\pi \hslash^2 a_s/m$, with s-wave scattering length $a_s$. The tunnelling rate $J$ is determined by diagonalizing the optical lattice Hamiltonian (in the $z$-direction),
$\hat{H} = - \hslash^2 \partial_z^2/2m + V_0 \sin^2(2 \pi z / \lambda)$, and  using a tight-binding approximation (see Supplemental Material~\cite{SM}).  The projector $\mathcal{P}$ limits the dynamics of Eq.~(\ref{eq:gpe}) to the single particle modes that are highly occupied, (i.e., the classical field region) via an energy cutoff~\cite{SM}. Provided this is appropriately chosen, the model is insensitive to its precise value; we emphasise this leaves no free parameters in the model.


Tunnelling between neighbouring sites $i$ and $j=i\pm1$ depends on the overlap between the respective fields. This is evidenced through the evolution of the atom number on site $i$, $N_i$, 
\begin{align}
\frac{dN_i}{dt} = \frac{2J}{\hbar} \left(\eta_{i+1,i} \sqrt{N_{i+1}N_i} + \eta_{i-1,i} \sqrt{N_{i-1}N_i}\right), \label{eq:fillrate}
\end{align}
 with the ``Frank-Condon factors"
\begin{align}
\eta_{i,j}(t) &= {\text{Im}[\braket{\psi_{i}} {\psi_j}]}/{\sqrt{N_i N_{j}}} ,\nonumber\\ & = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N_iN_j}}\int d^2\bm{x} \sqrt{n_i(\bm{x}) n_j(\bm{x})} \sin [\varphi_{ij}(\bm{x})] ,
\label{eqn:FrankCondon}
\end{align} 
where $\psi_i(\bm{x}) = \sqrt{n_i(\bm{x})}e^{i \phi_i(\bm{x})}$ and $\varphi_{ij}(\bm{x}) \equiv \phi_i(\bm{x}) - \phi_j(\bm{x})$. The number-dependent filling mechanism is thus explicitly contained within the c-field formalism; this contrasts with the effective single particle description employed in Ref.~\cite{Labouvie2015}, where it was assumed to be $\eta_{i,j} \sim | \langle \psi_i | \psi_j \rangle |$, and approximated \emph{a posteriori} to be 
 linear in the particle difference $|N_i - N_j|$.

\emph{Results --- }  We solve Eq.~(\ref{eq:gpe}) via a pseudospectral method with quadrature using XMDS2~\cite{xmds2}, enabling accurate simulation of a large number of sites. Throughout we work in radial harmonic oscillator units, giving units for energy $\hbar \omega_r$, length $l_r = \sqrt{\hbar / m \omega_r}$, and  time $\omega_r^{-1}$.  We model the experiment using a uniform 21-site chain;  each site (for $i\neq0$)  contains $N_f\sim 700$ atoms~\cite{Labouvie2015}, and $g_2 \sim 0.2 \hbar \omega l_r^2$, giving $\mu_R \sim 7 \hbar \omega_r$.  
As per Ref.~\cite{Labouvie2015}, the central site ($i=0$) is populated such that the atom number is $N_0/N_f \sim 5\%$. From a detailed modelling of the experimental preparation protocol, we find that, at the end of the preparation sequence, the left and right chains become nearly uncorrelated in their phases. For the initial conditions, we therefore multiply one of the chains by a random phase to mimic this phase diffusion.
Full details of the experimental modelling setup and simulation method are provided in the Supplemental Material~\cite{SM}.

We first compare the results of the numerical simulations directly against the experimental observations of Ref.~\cite{Labouvie2015}. In Fig.~\ref{fig:fullns} we show the atom number $N_0/N_f$ vs. time  for three different tunnelling couplings $J$. The c-field model is in excellent agreement across the full range of coupling values. The model produces the characteristic ``S"-shaped filling curves, which suggest ohmic behaviour at small voltages (late times) and NDC at large voltages (early times) [cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:Schematic}(c)]. Figure \ref{fig:fullns} (inset) shows the filling time, $t_f$, defined as the time at which $N_0$ reaches $2/3$ of its final value~\cite{Labouvie2015}. We find the filling time obeys the power-law $t_f \propto J^{-\alpha}$, with  $\alpha = 1.82(3)$. This is in good agreement with the value of $\alpha = 1.9(1)$ obtained in Ref.~\cite{Labouvie2015} which utilized an effective single particle model with a fitted decoherence parameter.

Having established that the model quantitatively reproduces experimental observations, we now turn to gaining deeper insight into the mechanisms underlying the NDC-type behaviour.The experimental measurement protocol of Labouvie \emph{et al.}~\cite{Labouvie2015} was destructive, so that every data point in Fig.~\ref{fig:fullns}(a) is an average over several experimental runs beginning with an independent condensate.  Consequently, the results of single experiments cannot be inferred. However, for the TWA, the individual simulation trajectories approximately correspond to the behaviour of single experimental runs~\cite{Blakie2008}.  In Fig.~\ref{fig:mean_vs_trajectories}(a) we compare the mean atom number vs.~time, $\langle N_0(t) \rangle$  (red-dashed line), with $N_0(t)$ for several  individual simulation trajectories, with $J/\hbar\omega_r=0.097$~\protect\cite{normalisation_of_trajectories}.

%In Fig.~\ref{fig:mean_vs_trajectories}(a) we compare the mean atom number vs.~time, $\langle N_0(t) \rangle$  (red-dashed line), with, $N_0(t)$ for several  individual simulation trajectories, with $J/\hbar\omega_r=0.097$~\protect\cite{normalisation_of_trajectories}. Within the TWA, the trajectories approximately correspond to the behaviour in individual experimental runs~\cite{Blakie2008}. 
%This allows deeper insight than was available experimentally,  where, due to the destructive nature of the measurement protocol, every data point corresponds to a different condensate. Therefore, only the mean results were available and the behavior of individual trajectory dynamics could not be inferred in Ref.~\cite{Labouvie2015}. 


 In the simulations the individual trajectories and overall  curve for the mean $\langle N_0(t) \rangle$ exhibit similar behaviour at early times but markedly different behaviour at late times. In particular, the characteristic ``S"-shape  that was observed experimentally  [cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:fullns}] only appears in the mean  of the simulation data; it emerges due to the probabilistic filling of the individual trajectories, which have different filling times due to quantum noise. In individual trajectories [Fig.~\ref{fig:mean_vs_trajectories}(a)], the current can be seen to in fact \emph{accelerate} rather than decelerate during the latter stages of filling.  Unlike the smooth growth of the mean, the current in individual trajectories is a rapidly oscillating chirped signal in time [Fig.~\ref{fig:mean_vs_trajectories}(b)].  In many trajectories a rapid growth of the atom number occurs during latter stages of the filling [Fig.~\ref{fig:mean_vs_trajectories}(a)]; this is accompanied by oscillations that increase in amplitude and decrease in frequency as time progresses. This rapid growth phase also coincides with a sudden growth in the condensate fraction~\cite{SM}; the late-stage oscillations are thus strongly suggestive of the ``AC Josephson effect"  previously observed in, for example, Refs.~\cite{Pereverzev1997,Levy2007}.

Differences between the mean and individual trajectories are further highlighted in Fig.~\ref{fig:mean_vs_trajectories}(c), which shows the rate of change of the mean atom number $I_m = d\langle N_0 \rangle/dt$ and the average trajectory current $I_t = \langle dN_0/dt \rangle$, plotted against the atom number difference $\Delta N = (N_f-N_0)/N_f$.
For $\Delta N \gtrsim 0.6$ ($t\lesssim t_f$), we find $I_t \approx I_m$, with both exhibiting the NDC characteristic Eq.~(\ref{eq:NDC}). However, for  $\Delta N \lesssim 0.6$ ($t \gtrsim t_f$), we find $I_t\neq I_m$. Notably, the ohmic region ($I \propto \Delta N$) seen in $I_m$ is only apparent in the average. Contrarily, the trajectory data in Fig.~\ref{fig:mean_vs_trajectories}(c) suggest that the individual trajectories instead exhibit the NDC characteristic over the entire range of $\Delta N$. The rapid current oscillations in the trajectories [Fig.~\ref{fig:mean_vs_trajectories}(b)] also result in significant fluctuations in $I_t$ [Fig.~\ref{fig:mean_vs_trajectories}(c), errorbars]; these are in fact larger than the average currents for most values of $\Delta N$. Note that we have refrained from defining a ``chemical voltage" $\Delta \mu$ as in Ref.~\cite{Labouvie2015}, because this requires the assumption of quasi-equilibrium, whereas $\Delta N$ is always defined. To support this, in the Supplemental Material \cite{SM} we demonstrate that the experiment~\cite{Labouvie2015} is far-from equilibrium.


 

The results in Fig.~\ref{fig:mean_vs_trajectories}(a) show that the trajectories certainly exhibit the NDC characteristic Eq.~(\ref{eq:NDC}). However, this alone is not sufficient for the behaviour to be classified as NDC; it is also necessary to consider the role played by the relative phases between sites. NDC in the usual sense would require that the phase information is unimportant, such that the current can be characterized simply through the particle number difference as  $I = I(\Delta N)$. By contrast, Josephson junctions are characterized by both an imbalance (voltage) and their intrinsic phase difference, i.e., $I = I(\Delta N, \varphi)$, and for this reason they are not readily classified as NDC elements despite exhibiting quasi-NDC-type behaviour~\cite{Shaw1992_1,Shaw1992_6}. 


To investigate the role of the phase in the dynamics, we consider the phase difference between the nearest-neighbour sites $i = \pm 1$ in individual trajectories. We define $\Delta \Phi_i = \Phi_{i+ 1} - \Phi_{i-1}$, where $\Phi_i$ is the spatially averaged phase $\Phi_i = \mathcal{A}^{-1} \int_\mathcal{A} d^2 \bm{x} \; \phi_i \equiv \langle \phi_i \rangle_{\bm{x}} $ (where $\mathcal{A}$ is a central region in well $i$).  Figure \ref{fig:relativePhase} shows the dependence of the filling dynamics on the initial phase difference across the central site, $\Delta\Phi_0$, for three different values of $J$. For small couplings ($J/\hbar \omega_r= 0.05$), the filling time is found to be approximately independent of the initial phase difference. However, for moderate tunnelling $(J/\hbar \omega_r = 0.2)$, when the left and right chains are initially out of phase $(|\Delta \Phi_0| \sim \pi)$ the filling time is approximately double that of the synchronized case $|\Delta \Phi_0| \sim 0 $. For large couplings ($J/\hbar \omega_r = 0.6$), this discrepancy becomes even larger, yielding a factor of $\sim$ 6 difference in the filling times between the zero-phase and $\pi$-phase difference scenarios. For $|\Delta\Phi_0| \sim \pi$, we also observe a significant increase in the fluctuations of the filling time, as seen in the large standard deviations indicated by the error bars.

\emph{Discussion --- }  Our results suggest that the NDC interpretation put forward in Ref.~\cite{Labouvie2015} is only valid at small values of $J$ and during the early stages of the filling dynamics, where phase coherence is unimportant.  For most regimes the phase difference is a crucial element in the dynamics.  Indeed, Eq.~(\ref{eq:fillrate}) shows that both the particle number difference and phase differences drive the current, since $\eta_{i,j} \propto \Im \{\langle \psi_i | \psi_j \rangle\}$ rather than $|\langle \psi_i|\psi_j \rangle |$ as was assumed in Ref.~\cite{Labouvie2015}.  To consider the average contributions from the phase, one should consider the  
the conjugate equation to Eq.~(\ref{eq:fillrate}), which governs the evolution of the spatially-averaged phase $\Phi_j$:
\begin{equation}
\hbar \partial_t \Phi_j + \mu^{\rm eff}_{j} =  J \zeta_j,
\label{eqn:Phi}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
    \mu^{\rm eff}_{j} =  \left\langle \tfrac{1}{2} m \mathbf{u}_j^2 + g_2 n_j + V - \tfrac{\hbar^2}{2 m} \tfrac{\nabla^2 \sqrt{n_j}}{\sqrt{n_j}} \right\rangle_{\bm{x}},
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{u}_j(\bm{x},t) =  \hbar\nabla \phi_j(\bm{x},t)/m$ is the velocity field on site $j$, and
\begin{equation}
    \zeta_j = \left\langle \sqrt{\tfrac{n_{j+1}}{n_j}} \cos( \varphi_{j+1,j}) + \sqrt{\tfrac{n_{j-1}}{n_j}} \cos( \varphi_{j-1,j} ) \right\rangle_{\bm{x}}.
    \label{eqn:zeta}
\end{equation}
The evolution of the average variables $(N_j,\Phi_j)$ relies on a rather non-trivial coarse graining over the internal dynamics of the sites; this depends on the instantaneous density fields $n_j$, relative phases $\varphi_{ij}$, and on-site velocity fields $\mathbf{u}_j$. 

Our model clearly reproduces the observed experimental behavior, and thus serves as a natural starting point for developing a reduced ``lumped-element"-type description. However, whether the full dynamics of Eq.~(\ref{eq:gpe}) can indeed be reduced to a simple effective model in terms of $(N_j,\Phi_j)$ remains an  open problem. We anticipate the results could be significantly affected by, e.g., thermal effects (condensate fraction), collective modes, or quantized vortices, which all affect the average phase coherence. While a comprehensive study of finite temperature effects is beyond the scope of the present work, we performed simulations of a mostly incoherent process ($<5\%$ condensate fraction in the reservoirs), which further support the interpretations put forward here (see~\cite{SM}). In particular, the acceleration of the current in individual trajectories is absent for the incoherent filling process, indicating that phase coherence is essential for this process to occur. 
Finally, we note that many of the system's qualitative dynamical features can be reproduced by a simple ``coherent reservoir" model, wherein the reservoir is treated as a coherent AC drive.
This model was described in Ref.~\cite{Reeves2021} to model a related experiment wherein dissipation was introduced to the central site~\cite{Labouvie2016}, and may serve as a useful starting point for a simplified description of multimode Josephson junction dynamics. 


\emph{Conclusions --- } We have characterized the nonequilibrium dynamics of a many-body, multimode bosonic Josephson chain, and demonstrated that a c-field description can quantitatively reproduce the observations of Ref.~\cite{Labouvie2015} with no fitted parameters. Our model suggests that the dynamics are strongly dependent on both the atom number and phase. We argue this makes the NDC interpretation invalid for the majority of the couplings considered in Ref.~\cite{Labouvie2015}. The filling appears to be a ``two-stage" process: our results do suggest that the NDC interpretation is valid at small $J$ and during the initial (gradual)  phase of the filling, before phase coherence is established. However, this interpretation is complicated in latter (rapid) stages of the filling by the emergence of phase coherence and strong Josephson oscillations. Additionally, significant (quantum) fluctuations are present, and will likely need to be incorporated into any simplified effective model that quantitatively reproduces the salient features of the dynamics. 
From a device perspective, it would be worthwhile considering how the atomtronic junction behaves under an enforced chemical potential bias, rather than under free dynamics, so as to be considered as a single component of a larger DC or AC atomtronic circuit.
