The two previously known giant LABs are the most luminous and the largest in our survey volume of 1.3 × 105 Mpc3. We reveal the internal structures of the two giant LABs and discover some bubble-like features, which suggest that intensive starburst and galactic superwind phenomena occurred in these objects in the past. The other 33 LABs have isophotal areas of ∼16–78 arcsec2 and flux of (0.7–7) × 10-16 ergs s-1 cm-2. These 35 LABs show a continuous distribution of isophotal area and emission-line flux. The distributions of average surface brightness and morphology are widespread from relatively compact high surface brightness objects to very diffuse low surface brightness ones. The physical origins of these LABs may be (1) photoionization by massive stars or active galactic nuclei, or (2) cooling radiation from gravitationally heated gas, or (3) shock heating by starburst-driven galactic superwind. One-third of the LABs are apparently not associated with ultraviolet continuum sources that are bright enough to produce Lyα emission, assuming a Salpeter initial mass function. Of these LABs 90% are located inside the high surface density region of the 283 relatively compact and strong Lyα emitters selected in our previous study. This suggests that these LABs may be phenomena related to a dense environment at high redshift.}

	abstract = {With close pairs of quasars at different redshifts, a background quasar sightline can be used to study a foreground quasar's environment in absorption. We use a sample of 650 projected quasar pairs to study the H i Lyα absorption transverse to luminous, z ∼ 2 quasars at proper separations of 30 kpc < R⊥ < 1 Mpc. In contrast to measurements along the line-of-sight, regions transverse to quasars exhibit enhanced H i Lyα absorption and a larger variance than the ambient intergalactic medium, with increasing absorption and variance toward smaller scales. Analysis of composite spectra reveals excess absorption characterized by a Lyα equivalent width profile W = 2.3 Å (R⊥/100 kpc)−0.46. We also observe a high (≃ 60%) covering factor of strong, optically thick H i absorbers (H i column ) at separations R⊥ < 200 kpc, which decreases to ∼20% at R⊥ ≃ 1 Mpc, but still represents a significant excess over the cosmic average. This excess of optically thick absorption can be described by a quasar-absorber cross-correlation function ξQA(r) = (r/r0)γ with a large correlation length (comoving) and . The H i absorption measured around quasars exceeds that of any previously studied population, consistent with quasars being hosted by massive dark matter halos Mhalo ≈ 1012.5 M☉ at z ∼ 2.5. The environments of these massive halos are highly biased toward producing optically thick gas, and may even dominate the cosmic abundance of Lyman limit systems and hence the intergalactic opacity to ionizing photons at z ∼ 2.5. The anisotropic absorption around quasars implies the transverse direction is much less likely to be illuminated by ionizing radiation than the line-of-sight.}

In this paper, we show that if ≳20 per cent of the gravitational binding energy of the gas is radiated away then the simulated cold flows are spatially extended Lyα sources with luminosities, Lyα linewidths and number densities that are comparable to those of observed Lyα blobs. Furthermore, the filamentary structure of the cold flows can explain the wide range of observed Lyα blob morphologies. Since the most massive haloes form in dense environments, the association of Lyα blobs with overdense regions arise naturally. We argue that Lyα blobs – even those which are clearly associated with starburst galaxies or quasars – provide direct observational support for the cold accretion mode of galaxies. We discuss various testable predictions of this association.}",
