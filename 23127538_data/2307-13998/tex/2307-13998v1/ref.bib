 abstract = {We analyze the problem of an investor who needs to unwind a portfolio in the face of recurring and uncertain liquidity needs, with a model that accounts for both permanent and temporary price impact of trading. We first show that a risk-neutral investor who myopically deleverages his position to meet an immediate need for cash always prefers to sell more liquid assets. If the investor faces the possibility of a downstream shock, however, the solution differs in several important ways. If the ensuing shock is sufficiently large, the nonmyopic investor unwinds positions more than immediately necessary and, all else being equal, prefers to retain more of the assets with low temporary price impact in order to hedge against possible distress. More generally, optimal liquidation involves selling strictly more of the assets with a lower ratio of permanent to temporary impact, even if these assets are relatively illiquid. The results suggest that properly accounting for the possibility of future shocks should play a role in managing large portfolios.},

abstract = {Abstract We investigate the optimal portfolio deleveraging (OPD) problem with permanent and temporary price impacts, where the objective is to maximize equity while meeting a prescribed debt/equity requirement. We take the real situation with cross impact among different assets into consideration. The resulting problem is, however, a nonconvex quadratic program with a quadratic constraint and a box constraint, which is known to be NP-hard. In this paper, we first develop a successive convex optimization (SCO) approach for solving the OPD problem and show that the SCO algorithm converges to a KKT point of its transformed problem. Second, we propose an effective global algorithm for the OPD problem, which integrates the SCO method, simple convex relaxation, and a branch-and-bound framework, to identify a global optimal solution to the OPD problem within a prespecified ε-tolerance. We establish the global convergence of our algorithm and estimate its complexity. We also conduct numerical experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithms with both real data and randomly generated medium- and large-scale OPD instances.}

	abstract = {In this paper, we design an eigenvalue decomposition based branch-and-bound algorithm for finding global solutions of quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP) problems. The hardness of nonconvex QCQP problems roots in the nonconvex components of quadratic terms, which are represented by the negative eigenvalues and the corresponding eigenvectors in the eigenvalue decomposition. For certain types of QCQP problems, only very few eigenvectors, defined as sensitive-eigenvectors, determine the relaxation gaps. We propose a semidefinite relaxation based branch-and-bound algorithm to solve QCQP. The proposed algorithm, which branches on the directions of the sensitive-eigenvectors, is very efficient for solving certain types of QCQP problems.},
