abstract = "The problems of finding a longest common subsequence and a shortest common supersequence of a set of strings are well known. They can be solved in polynomial time for two strings (in fact the problems are dual in this case), or for any fixed number of strings, by dynamic programming. But both problems are NP-hard in general for an arbitrary numberkof strings. Here we study the related problems of finding a shortest maximal common subsequence and a longest minimal common supersequence. We describe dynamic programming algorithms for the case of two strings (for which case the problems are no longer dual), which can be extended to any fixed number of strings. We also show that both problems are NP-hard in general forkstrings, although the latter problem, unlike shortest common supersequence, is solvable in polynomial time for strings of length 2. Finally, we prove a strong negative approximability result for the shortest maximal common subsequence problem."

This work will be described in another paper in this issue (see pages 133–149). To achieve this goal it was necessary to understand the merits and limitations of the various available comparative genomics tools. A review of some recent tools for multisequence/genome alignment and substring comparison is presented, within the general framework of applicability to a large-scale application. We note that genome alignments are important for many things, only one of which is pathogen detection. Understanding gene function, gene regulation, gene networks, phylogenetic studies and other aspects of evolution all depend on accurate nucleic acid and protein sequence alignment. Selecting appropriate tools can make a large difference in the quality of results obtained and the effort required.}",

abstract = "The edit distance between two character strings can be defined as the minimum cost of a sequence of editing operations which transforms one string into the other. The operations we admit are deleting, inserting and replacing one symbol at a time, with possibly different costs for each of these operations. The problem of finding the longest common subsequence of two strings is a special case of the problem of computing edit distances. We describe an algorithm for computing the edit distance between two strings of length n and m, n ⪖ m, which requires O(n · max(1, mlog n)) steps whenever the costs of edit operations are integral multiples of a single positive real number and the alphabet for the strings is finite. These conditions are necessary for the algorithm to achieve the time bound."

abstract = {We consider the indexable dictionary problem, which consists of storing a set S ⊆
{0,…,m − 1} for some integer m while supporting the operations of rank(x), which returns
the number of elements in S that are less than x if x ∈ S, and −1 otherwise; and select(i),
which returns the ith smallest element in S. We give a data structure that supports
both operations in O(1) time on the RAM model and requires B(n, m) + o(n) + O(lg lg
m) bits to store a set of size n, where B(n, m) = ⌊lg (m/n)⌋ is the minimum number
of bits required to store any n-element subset from a universe of size m. Previous
dictionaries taking this space only supported (yes/no) membership queries in O(1)
time. In the cell probe model we can remove the O(lg lg m) additive term in the space
bound, answering a question raised by Fich and Miltersen [1995] and Pagh [2001].We
present extensions and applications of our indexable dictionary data structure, including:—an
information-theoretically optimal representation of a k-ary cardinal tree that supports
standard operations in constant time;—a representation of a multiset of size n from
{0,…,m − 1} in B(n, m + n) + o(n) bits that supports (appropriate generalizations
of) rank and select operations in constant time; and + O(lg lg m)—a representation
of a sequence of n nonnegative integers summing up to m in B(n, m + n) + o(n) bits
that supports prefix sum queries in constant time.},
