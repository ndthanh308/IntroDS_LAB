  "abstract": "Inspired by a dipole asymmetric template for the CMB temperature map in the primordial scalar fluctuations observed by Planck at a large scale, we examine the contribution of a similar template for power asymmetry in modifying the linear polarization pattern of CMB. Replacing un-modulated temperature fluctuation with dipolar modulated one in time evolution equations somehow breaks linear perturbation in the various components of the CMB map. This non-linearity allows deflecting CMB polarization in patterns that contain divergence-free components. The explicit expressions for the angular power spectra of the electric and magnetic-type parities of linear polarization are derived in the form of the line of sight integral solutions. Our results demonstrate that the electric-type polarization is modified and the magnetic-type polarization would be produced. Such imprints depend on the linear and square of the asymmetric amplitude for $E$- and $B$-modes power spectra, respectively. For the observed dipole template, the value of $B$ polarization spectrum at the large scale ($\\ell\\lesssim 10$) is almost equivalent to the power spectrum obtained from Compton scattering in the presence of tensor perturbation with tensor to scalar ratio about $r\\simeq0.005$.",
