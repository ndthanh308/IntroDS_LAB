  "abstract": "These lecture notes, prepared for the 2022 QUC summer school at KIAS, provide an introduction to Higgs Effective Field Theory and the use of field geometry in Quantum Field Theory. While not sounding the depths of any of these topics, we will cover and give a sense of the inner workings of: the action for Goldstone bosons, the independence of scattering amplitudes from field parametrisations, linear vs non-linear realizations --their `geography' and experimental prospects to tell them apart--, ultra-violet completions and the LSZ formula for fields in curved space.",
