	The assembly and persistence of ecological communities can be
	understood as the result of the interaction and migration of species. Here we
	study a single community subject to migration from a species pool in which
	inter-specific interactions are organised according to a bipartite network. Considering
	the dynamics of species abundances to be governed by generalised
	Lotka-Volterra equations, we extend work on unipartite networks to we derive
	exact results for the phase diagram of this model. Focusing on antagonistic interactions,
	we describe factors that influence the persistence of the two guilds,
	locate transitions to multiple-attractor and unbounded phases, as well identify
	a region of parameter space in which consumers are essentially absent in the
	local community.
