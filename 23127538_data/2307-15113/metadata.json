  "abstract": "Motivated by spectroscopic confirmation of three overdense regions in the COSMOS field at $z\\sim3.35$, we analyze the uniquely deep multi-wavelength photometry and extensive spectroscopy available in the field to identify any further related structure. We construct a three dimensional density map using the Voronoi tesselation Monte Carlo method and find additional regions of significant overdensity. Here we present and examine a set of six overdense structures at $3.20<z<3.45$ in the COSMOS field, the most well characterized of which, PCl~J0959+0235, has 80 spectroscopically confirmed members and an estimated mass of $1.35\\times 10^{15}$~M$_\\odot$, and is modeled to virialize at $z\\sim1.5-2.0$. These structures contain ten overdense peaks with $>5σ$ overdensity separated by up to 70 cMpc, suggestive of a proto-supercluster similar to the Hyperion system at $z\\sim2.45$. Upcoming photometric surveys with JWST such as COSMOS-Web, and further spectroscopic follow-up will enable more extensive analysis of the evolutionary effects that such an environment may have on its component galaxies at these early times.",
