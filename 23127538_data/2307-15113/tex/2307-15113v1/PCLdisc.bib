abstract = {We present the results of a systematic study of the rest-frame optical morphology of quiescent galaxies at {\$}z \backslashgeq 3{\$} using the Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) onboard {\$}JWST{\$}. Based on a sample selected by {\$}UVJ{\$} color or {\$}NUVUVJ{\$} color, we focus on 26 quiescent galaxies with {\$}9.8{\textless}\backslashlog{\{}(M{\_}\backslashstar/M{\_}\backslashodot){\}}{\textless}11.4{\$} at {\$}2.8{\textless}z{\_}{\{}\backslashrm phot{\}}{\textless}4.6{\$} with publicly available {\$}JWST{\$} data. Their sizes are constrained by fitting the S$\backslash$'ersic profile to all available NIRCam images. We see a negative correlation between the observed wavelength and the size in our sample and derive their size at the rest-frame {\$}0.5\backslash, {\{}\backslashrm \backslashmu m{\}}{\$} taking into account this trend. Our quiescent galaxies show a significant correlation between the rest-frame {\$}0.5\backslash, {\{}\backslashrm \backslashmu m{\}}{\$} size and the stellar mass at {\$}z\backslashgeq3{\$}. The analytical fit for them at {\$}\backslashlog{\{}(M{\_}\backslashstar/M{\_}\backslashodot){\}}{\textgreater}10.3{\$} implies that our size - stellar mass relations are below those at lower redshifts, with the amplitude of {\$}\backslashsim0.6\backslash, {\{}\backslashrm kpc{\}}{\$} at {\$}M{\_}\backslashstar = 5\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}\backslash, M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. This value agrees with the extrapolation from the size evolution of quiescent galaxies at {\$}z{\textless}3{\$} in the literature, implying that the size of quiescent galaxies increases monotonically from {\$}z\backslashsim3-5{\$}. Our sample is mainly composed of galaxies with bulge-like structures according to their median S$\backslash$'ersic index and axis ratio of {\$}n\backslashsim3-4{\$} and {\$}q\backslashsim0.6-0.8{\$}, respectively. On the other hand, there is a trend of increasing fraction of galaxies with low S$\backslash$'ersic index, suggesting {\$}3{\textless}z{\textless}5{\$} might be the epoch of onset of morphological transformation with a fraction of very notable disky quenched galaxies.},

To probe their Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} escape, we study the spatial profiles of Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} and UV continuum emission of 24 Green Pea galaxies using the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) on Hubble Space Telescope (HST). We extract the spatial profiles of Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emission from their 2D COS spectra, and of UV continuum from both the 2D spectra and NUV images. The Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emission shows more extended spatial profiles than the UV continuum in most Green Peas. The deconvolved Full Width Half Maximum (FWHM) of the Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} spatial profile is about 2 to 4 times that of the UV continuum in most cases. The Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} light shows significant offsets from the UV continuum in four galaxies and central absorption in one galaxy. We also compare the spatial profiles of Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} photons at blueshifted and redshifted velocities in eight Green Peas with sufficient data quality, and find the blue wing of the Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} line has a larger spatial extent than the red wing in four Green Peas with comparatively weak blue Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} line wings. These results together indicate that most Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} photons escape out of Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-emitting galaxies through many resonant scatterings in the HI gas. Five Lyman continuum (LyC) leakers in this sample have similar Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} to UV continuum size ratios ({\$}\backslashsim1.4-4.3{\$}) to the other Green Peas, indicating their LyC emission escape through ionized holes in the interstellar medium.},

abstract = {Context. Rich superclusters of galaxies represent dynamically active environments in which galaxies and their systems form and evolve. Aims. We study the dynamical properties and connectivity of the richest galaxy clusters in the Corona Borealis (CB) supercluster and of the whole supercluster, and analyse star formation of galaxies in them with the aim to understand the evolution of the supercluster and the galaxies within it. We compare it with the supercluster SCl A2142. Methods. We used the luminosity-density field to determine the high-density cores of the CB. We identified the richest galaxy clusters in them and studied the dynamical state of the clusters, analysed their substructure, and studied the star formation properties of galaxies in them using normal mixture modelling and the projected phase space diagram. We determined filaments in the supercluster to analyse the connectivity of clusters. To understand the possible future evolution of the CB, we compared the mass distribution in it with predictions from the spherical collapse model and analysed the gravitational acceleration field in the CB. Results. The richest clusters in the high-density cores of the CB are the Abell clusters A2065, A2061 (together with A2067), A2089, and Gr2064. At a radius R30 around each cluster (corresponding to the density contrast $\Delta$$\rho$ ≈ 30), the galaxy distribution shows a minimum. The R30 values for individual clusters lie in the range of 3-6 h-1 Mpc. The radii of the clusters (splashback radii) lie in the range of Rcl ≈ 2-3 Rvir. The projected phase space diagrams and the comparison with the spherical collapse model suggest that R30 regions have passed turnaround and are collapsing, forming infall regions around each cluster. Galaxies in the richest cluster of the CB, A2065, and in its infall region have on average younger stellar populations than other clusters and their environment. The cluster A2061 has the highest fraction of galaxies with very old stellar populations, similar to those in A2142. The number of long filaments that begin near clusters vary from one near A2089 to five near A2061. The total connectivity of these clusters (the number of infalling groups and filaments) varies from two to nine. Conclusions. During the future evolution, the clusters in the main part of the CB may merge and form one of the largest bound systems in the nearby Universe. Another part, with the cluster Gr2064, will form a separate system. Our study suggests that structures with a current characteristic density contrast $\Delta$$\rho$ ≈ 30 have passed turnaround and started to collapse at redshifts z ≈ 0.3-0.4. The comparison of the number and properties of the most massive collapsing supercluster cores from observations and simulations may serve as a test for cosmological models.},

abstract = {We present continuous, monochromatic star formation rate (SFR) indicators over the mid-infrared wavelength range of 6-70 micron. We use a sample of 58 star forming galaxies (SFGs) in the Spitzer-SDSS-GALEX Spectroscopic Survey (SSGSS) at z{\textless}0.2, for which there is a rich suite of multi-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy from the ultraviolet through to the infrared. The data from the Spitzer infrared spectrograph (IRS) of these galaxies, which spans 5-40 micron, is anchored to their photometric counterparts. The spectral region between 40-70 micron is interpolated using dust model fits to the IRS spectrum and Spitzer 70 and 160 micron photometry. Since there are no sharp spectral features in this region, we expect these interpolations to be robust. This spectral range is calibrated as a SFR diagnostic using several reference SFR indicators to mitigate potential bias. Our band-specific continuous SFR indicators are found to be consistent with monochromatic calibrations in the local universe, as derived from Spitzer, WISE, and Herschel photometry. Our local composite template and continuous SFR diagnostics are made available for public use through the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive (IRSA) and have typical dispersions of 30{\%} or less. We discuss the validity and range of applicability for our SFR indicators in the context of unveiling the formation and evolution of galaxies. Additionally, in the era of the James Webb Space Telescope this will become a flexible tool, applicable to any SFG up to z{\~{}}3.},

abstract = {LBQS 0302-0019 is a blue quasar (QSO) at z {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 3.3, hosting powerful outflows, and residing in a complex environment consisting of an obscured AGN candidate, and multiple companions, all within 30 kpc in projection. We use JWST NIRSpec IFS observations to characterise the ionized gas in this complex system. We develop a procedure to correct for the spurious oscillations (or 'wiggles') in NIRSpec single-spaxel spectra, due to the spatial under-sampling of the point spread function. We perform a quasar-host decomposition with the QDeblend3D tools, and use multi-component kinematic decomposition of the optical emission line profiles to infer the physical properties of the emitting gas. The quasar-host decomposition allows us to identify i) a low-velocity component possibly tracing a warm rotating disk, with a dynamical mass Mdyn {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}{\$} Msun and a rotation-to-random motion ratio {\$}v{\_}{\{}rot{\}}{\$}/{\$}\backslashsigma{\_}0 \backslashsim 2{\$}; ii) a spatially unresolved ionised outflow, with a velocity of {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 1000 km/s and an outflow mass rate of {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}4{\$} Msun/yr. We also detect eight interacting companion objects close to LBQS 0302-0019. Optical line ratios confirm the presence of a second, obscured AGN at {\$}\backslashsim 20{\$} kpc of the primary QSO; the dual AGN dominates the ionization state of the gas in the entire NIRSpec field-of-view. This work has unveiled with unprecedented detail the complex environment of this dual AGN, which includes nine interacting companions (five of which were previously unknown), all within 30 kpc of the QSO. Our results support a scenario where mergers can trigger dual AGN, and can be important drivers for rapid early SMBH growth.},

abstract = {Examining a sample of massive galaxies at 1.4{\textless}z{\textless}2.5 with K{\_}{\{}Vega{\}}{\textless}22 from the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey, we compare photometry from Spitzer at mid- and far-IR, to submillimeter, radio and rest-frame ultraviolet wavelengths, to test the agreement between different tracers of star formation rates (SFRs) and to explore the implications for galaxy assembly. For z{\~{}}2 galaxies with moderate luminosities(L{\_}{\{}8um{\}}{\textless}10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}L{\_}sun), we find that the SFR can be estimated consistently from the multiwavelength data based on local luminosity correlations. However,20--30{\%} of massive galaxies, and nearly all those with L{\_}{\{}8um{\}}{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}L{\_}sun, show a mid-IR excess which is likely due to the presence of obscured active nuclei, as shown in a companion paper. There is a tight and roughly linear correlation between stellar mass and SFR for 24um-detected galaxies. For a given mass, the SFR at z=2 was larger by a factor of {\~{}}4 and {\~{}}30 relative to that in star forming galaxies at z=1 and z=0, respectively. Typical ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) at z=2 are relatively 'transparent' to ultraviolet light, and their activity is long lived ({\~{}}400 Myr), unlike that in local ULIRGs and high redshift submillimeter-selected galaxies. ULIRGs are the common mode of star formation in massive galaxies at z=2, and the high duty cycle suggests that major mergers are not the dominant trigger for this activity.Current galaxy formation models underpredict the normalization of the mass-SFR correlation by about a factor of 4, and the space density of ULIRGs by an orderof magnitude, but give better agreement for z{\textgreater}1.4 quiescent galaxies.},

abstract = {[Abridged] In high density environment, the gas content of galaxies is stripped, leading to a rapid quenching of their star formation activity. This dramatic environmental effect is generally not taken into account in the SFHs usually assumed to perform spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting of these galaxies, yielding to a poor fit of their stellar emission and, consequently, a biased estimate of the SFR. We aim at reproducing the SFH of galaxies that underwent a rapid star formation quenching using a truncated delayed SFH that we implemented in the SED fitting code CIGALE. We show that the ratio between the instantaneous SFR and the SFR just before the quenching ({\$}r{\_}{\{}SFR{\}}{\$}) is well constrained as long as rest frame UV data are available. This SED modelling is applied to the Herschel Reference Survey (HRS) containing isolated galaxies and sources falling in the dense environment of the Virgo cluster. The latter are HI-deficient due to ram pressure stripping. We show that the truncated delayed SFH successfully reproduces their SED while typical SFH assumptions fail. A good correlation is found between {\$}r{\_}{\{}SFR{\}}{\$} and HI-def, the parameter quantifying the gas deficiency of cluster galaxies, meaning that SED fitting results can be used to provide a tentative estimate of the gas deficiency of galaxies for which HI observations are not available. The HRS galaxies are placed on the SFR-{\$}M{\_}*{\$} diagram showing that the HI-deficient sources lie in the quiescent region confirming previous studies. Using the {\$}r{\_}{\{}SFR{\}}{\$} parameter, we derive the SFR of these sources before quenching and show that they were previously on the main sequence relation. We show that the {\$}r{\_}{\{}SFR{\}}{\$} parameter is also well recovered for deeply obscured high redshift sources, as well as in absence of IR data. SED fitting is thus a powerful tool to identify galaxies that underwent a rapid star formation quenching.},

abstract = {The stellar initial mass function (IMF) is believed to be non-universal among early-type galaxies (ETGs). Parametrizing the IMF with the so-called IMF mismatch parameter aIMF, which is a measure of the stellar mass-to-light ratio of an ensemble of stars and thus of the 'heaviness' of its IMF, one finds that for ETGs ae (i.e. $\alpha$IMF integrated within the effective radius Re) increases with $\sigma$e(the line-of-sight velocity dispersion slos integrated within Re) and that, within the same ETG, $\alpha$IMF tends to decrease outwards. We study the effect of dissipationless (dry) mergers on the distribution of the IMF mismatch parameter $\alpha$IMF in ETGs using the results of binary major and minor merging simulations. We find that dry mergers tend to make the $\alpha$IMF profiles of ETGs shallower, but do not alter significantly the shape of the distributions in the spatially resolved $\sigma$los-$\alpha$IMF space. Individual galaxies undergoing dry mergers tend to decrease their ae, due to erosion of aIMF gradients and mixing with stellar populations with lighter IMF. Their $\sigma$ecan either decrease or increase, depending on the merging orbital parameters and mass ratio, but tends to decrease for cosmologically motivated merging histories. The $\alpha$e-$\sigma$erelation can vary with redshift as a consequence of the evolution of individual ETGs: based on a simple dry-merging model, ETGs of given se are expected to have higher ae at higher redshift, unless the accreted satellites are so diffuse that they contribute negligibly to the inner stellar distribution of the merger remnant.},

abstract = {The galaxies found in optical surveys fall in two distinct regions of a diagram of optical colour versus absolute magnitude: the red sequence and the blue cloud with the green valley in between. We show that the galaxies found in a submillimetre survey have almost the opposite distribution in this diagram, forming a `green mountain'. We show that these distinctive distributions follow naturally from a single, continuous, curved Galaxy Sequence in a diagram of specific star-formation rate versus stellar mass without there being the need for a separate star-forming galaxy Main Sequence and region of passive galaxies. The cause of the red sequence and the blue cloud is the geometric mapping between stellar mass/specific star-formation rate and absolute magnitude/colour, which distorts a continuous Galaxy Sequence in the diagram of intrinsic properties into a bimodal distribution in the diagram of observed properties. The cause of the green mountain is Malmquist bias in the submillimetre waveband, with submillimetre surveys tending to select galaxies on the curve of the Galaxy Sequence, which have the highest ratios of submillimetre-to-optical luminosity. This effect, working in reverse, causes galaxies on the curve of the Galaxy Sequence to be underrepresented in optical samples, deepening the green valley. The green valley is therefore not evidence (1) for there being two distinct populations of galaxies, (2) for galaxies in this region evolving more quickly than galaxies in the blue cloud and the red sequence, (c) for rapid quenching processes in the galaxy population.},

abstract = {Within one billion years of the Big Bang, intergalactic hydrogen was ionized by sources emitting ultraviolet and higher energy photons. This was the final phenomenon to globally affect all the baryons (visible matter) in the Universe. It is referred to as cosmic reionization and is an integral component of cosmology. It is broadly expected that intrinsically faint galaxies were the primary ionizing sources due to their abundance in this epoch. However, at the highest redshifts ({\$}z{\textgreater}7.5{\$}; lookback time 13.1 Gyr), all galaxies with spectroscopic confirmations to date are intrinsically bright and, therefore, not necessarily representative of the general population. Here, we report the unequivocal spectroscopic detection of a low luminosity galaxy at {\$}z{\textgreater}7.5{\$}. We detected the Lyman-{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emission line at {\$}\backslashsim 10504{\$} {\{}$\backslash$AA{\}} in two separate observations with MOSFIRE on the Keck I Telescope and independently with the Hubble Space Telescope's slit-less grism spectrograph, implying a source redshift of {\$}z = 7.640 \backslashpm 0.001{\$}. The galaxy is gravitationally magnified by the massive galaxy cluster MACS J1423.8+2404 ({\$}z = 0.545{\$}), with an estimated intrinsic luminosity of {\$}M{\_}{\{}AB{\}} = -19.6 \backslashpm 0.2{\$} mag and a stellar mass of {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}} = 3.0{\^{}}{\{}+1.5{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.8{\}} \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}8{\$} solar masses.

abstract = {We provide the first observational constraints on the sizes of the faintest galaxies lensed by the Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) clusters. Ionizing radiation from faint galaxies likely drives cosmic reionization, and the HFF initiative provides a key opportunity to find such galaxies. Yet, we cannot really assess their ionizing emissivity without a robust measurement of their sizes, since this is key to quantifying both their prevalence and the faint-end slope to the UV luminosity function. Here we provide the first such size constraints with 2 new techniques. The first utilizes the fact that the detectability of highly-magnified galaxies as a function of shear is very dependent on a galaxy's size. Only the most compact galaxies will remain detectable in regions of high shear (vs. a larger detectable size range for low shear), a phenomenon we carefully quantify using simulations. Remarkably, however, no correlation is found between the surface density of faint galaxies and the predicted shear, using 87 faint high-magnification mu{\textgreater}10 z{\~{}}2-8 galaxies seen behind the first 4 HFF clusters. This can only be the case if such faint ({\~{}}-15 mag) galaxies have significantly smaller sizes than luminous galaxies. We constrain their half-light radii to be {\textless}{\~{}}30 mas ({\textless}160-240 pc). As a 2nd size probe, we rotate and stack 26 faint high-magnification sources along the major shear axis. Less elongation is found than even for objects with an intrinsic half-light radius of 10 mas. Together these results indicate that extremely faint z{\~{}}2-8 galaxies have near point-source profiles in the HFF dataset (half-light radii conservatively {\textless}30 mas and likely 5-10 mas). These results suggest smaller completeness corrections and hence much lower volume densities for faint z{\~{}}2-8 galaxies and shallower faint-end slopes than have been derived in many recent studies (by factors of {\~{}}2-3 and by dalpha{\textgreater}{\~{}}0.1-0.3).},

abstract = {We search the five CANDELS fields (COSMOS, EGS, GOODS-North, GOODS-South, and UDS) for passively evolving a.k.a. ‘red and dead' massive galaxies in the first 2 Gyr after the big bang, integrating and updating the work on GOODS-South presented in a previous paper. We perform SED-fitting on photometric data, with top-hat star-formation histories to model an early and abrupt quenching, and using a probabilistic approach to select only robust candidates. Using libraries without (with) spectral lines emission, starting from a total of more than 20 000 z {\textgreater} 3 sources we end up with 102 (40) candidates, including one at z = 6.7. This implies a minimal number density of 1.73 ± 0.17 × 10−5 (6.69 ± 1.08 × 10−6) Mpc−3 for 3 {\textless} z {\textless} 5; applying a correction factor to account for incompleteness yields 2.30 ± 0.20 × 10−5. We compare these values with those from five recent hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, finding a reasonable agreement at z {\textless} 4; tensions arise at earlier epochs. Finally, we use the star-formation histories from the best-fitting models to estimate the contribution of the high-redshift passive galaxies to the global star formation rate density during their phase of activity, finding that they account for ∼5–10 per cent of the total star formation at 3 {\textless} z {\textless} 8, despite being only {\$}\backslashsim 0.5{\{}{\{}\backslash \backslashrm per\backslash cent{\}}{\}}{\$} of the total in number. The resulting picture is that early and strong star formation activity, building massive galaxies on short time-scales and followed by a quick and abrupt quenching, is a rare but crucial phenomenon in the early Universe: the evolution of the cosmos must be heavily influenced by the short but powerful activity of these pristine monsters.},

abstract = {We present a study of the morphological nature of redshift z ∼ 0.7 star-forming galaxies using a combination of HSTACS, GALEX, and ground-based images of the COSMOS field. Our sample consists of 8146 galaxies, 5777 of which are detected in the GALEXnear-ultraviolet band (2310 {\AA}or ∼ 1360 {\AA}rest frame) down to a limiting magnitude of 25.5 (AB), and all of which have a brightness of F814W(HST) {\textless} 23 mag and photometric redshifts in the range 0.55 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.8. We make use of the UV to estimate star formation rates, correcting for the effect of dust using the UV slope, and of the ground-based multiband data to calculate masses. For all galaxies in our sample, we compute, from the ACS F814W images, their concentration (C), asymmetry (A), and dumpiness (S), as well as their Gini coefficient (G) and the second moment of the brightest 20{\%} of their light (M 20). We observe a bimodality in the galaxy population in asymmetry and in dumpiness, although the separation is most evident when either of those parameters is combined with a concentration-like parameter (C, G, or M 20). We further show that this morphological bimodality has a strong correspondence with the FUV-g color bimodality and conclude that UV-optical color predominantly evolves concurrently with morphology. We observe many of the most star-forming galaxies to have morphologies approaching that of early-type galaxies, and we interpret this as evidence that strong starburst events are linked to bulge growth and constitute a process through which galaxies can be brought from the blue to the red sequence while simultaneously modifying their morphology accordingly. We conclude that the red sequence has continued growing at z ≲ 0.7. We also observe z ∼ 0.7 galaxies to have physical properties similar to that of local galaxies, except for higher star formation rates. Whence we infer that the dimming of star-forming galaxies is responsible for most of the evolution in star formation rate density since that redshift, although our data are also consistent with a mild number evolution. {\textcopyright} 2007.

The few z{\~{}}10-11 candidates discovered to date have been exceptionally small- barely resolved, if at all, by the Hubble Space Telescope. Here we present the discovery of SPT0615-JD, a fortuitous z{\~{}}10 (z{\_}phot=9.9+/-0.6) galaxy candidate stretched into an arc over {\~{}}2.5" by the effects of strong gravitational lensing.

With a magnification of $\backslash$mu{\~{}}4-7 estimated from our lens models, the de-lensed intrinsic magnitude is 27.6+/-0.3 AB mag, and the half-light radius is r{\_}e{\textless}0.8 kpc, both consistent with other z{\textgreater}9 candidates. The inferred stellar mass (log [M* /M{\_}Sun]=9.7{\^{}}{\{}+0.7{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.5{\}}) and star formation rate ($\backslash$log [SFR/M{\_}Sun yr{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}]=1.3{\^{}}{\{}+0.2{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.3{\}}) indicate that this candidate is a typical star-forming galaxy on the z{\textgreater}6 SFR-M* relation. We note that three independent lens models predict two counterimages, at least one of which should be of a similar magnitude to the arc, but these counterimages are not yet detected. Counterimages would not be expected if the arc were at lower redshift. However, the only spectral energy distributions capable of fitting the Hubble and Spitzer photometry well at lower redshifts require unphysical combinations of z{\~{}}2 galaxy properties. The unprecedented lensed size of this z{\~{}}10 candidate offers the potential for the James Webb Space Telescope to study the geometric and kinematic properties of a galaxy observed 500 Myr after the Big Bang.},

abstract = {The fundamental plane (FP) is an empirical relation between the size, surface brightness, and velocity dispersion of early-type galaxies. This relation has been studied extensively for early-type galaxies in the local universe to constrain galaxy formation mechanisms. The evolution of the zero point of this plane has been extended to high redshifts to study the luminosity evolution of massive galaxies, under the assumption of structural homology. In this work, we assess this assumption by replacing surface brightness with stellar mass density and present the evolution of the "mass FP" for massive, quiescent galaxies since z {\~{}} 2. By accounting for stellar populations, we thereby isolate and trace structural and dynamical evolution. Despite the observed dramatic evolution in the sizes and morphologies of massive galaxies since z {\~{}} 3, we find that quiescent galaxies lie on the mass FP out to z {\~{}} 2. In contrast with {\~{}}1.4 dex evolution in the luminosity FP, average residuals from the z {\~{}} 0 mass FP are less than {\~{}}0.15 dex since z {\~{}} 2. Assuming the Hyde {\&} Bernardi mass FP slope, we find that this minimal offset scales as (1 + z)-0.095 ± 0.043. This result lends credence to previous studies that derived luminosity evolution from the FP. Therefore, despite their compact sizes and suggestions that massive galaxies are more disk-like at z {\~{}} 2, the relationship between their dynamics and structural properties are consistent with local early-type galaxies. Finally, we find no strong evidence for a tilt of the mass FP relative to the virial plane, but emphasize the need for full models including selection biases to fully investigate this issue.},

abstract = {We obtained ALMA spectroscopy and imaging to investigate the origin of the unexpected sub-mm emission toward the most distant quiescent galaxy known to date, ZF-COSMOS-20115 at z=3.717. We show here that this sub-mm emission is produced by another massive, compact and extremely obscured galaxy, located only 3.1 kpc away from the quiescent galaxy. We dub the quiescent and dusty galaxies Jekyll and Hyde, respectively. No dust emission is detected at the location of Jekyll, implying SFR {\textless} 13 Msun/yr, which is the most stringent upper limit ever obtained for a quiescent galaxy at these redshifts. The two sources are confirmed to lie at the same redshift thanks to the detection of [CII]158 in Hyde, which provides one the few robust redshifts for an "H-dropout" galaxy. The line has a rotating-disk velocity profile blueshifted from Jekyll by 549+/-60 km/s, demonstrating that it is produced by another galaxy. Careful de-blending of the Spitzer imaging confirms the existence of Hyde, and its non-detection with Hubble requires extreme attenuation by dust. Modeling the photometry of both galaxies shows that Jekyll has fully quenched {\textgreater}200 Myr prior to observation and still presents a challenge for models, while Hyde only harbors moderate star-formation (SFR{\textless}120 Msun/yr) and is located at least a factor 1.4 below the z{\~{}}4 main sequence. Hyde could also have stopped forming stars {\textless}200 Myr before being observed, which would be consistent with its hight compactness similar to z{\~{}}4 quiescent galaxies and its low [CII]/FIR ratio, but significant SF cannot be ruled out. Finally, we show that Hyde hosts a dense reservoir of gas comparable to that of extreme starbursts, suggesting that its SFR was reduced without expelling the gas outside of the galaxy. We argue that Jekyll and Hyde can be seen as two stages of quenching, and provide a unique laboratory to study this poorly understood phenomenon. [abridged]},

abstract = {We present the first stellar velocity dispersion measurement of a massive quenching galaxy at z=4.01. The galaxy is first identified as a massive z{\textgreater}{\~{}}4 galaxy with suppressed star formation from photometric redshifts based on deep multi-band data in the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey field. A follow-up spectroscopic observation with MOSFIRE on Keck revealed strong multiple absorption features, which are identified as Balmer absorption lines, giving a secure redshift of z=4.01. Thanks to the high S/N of the spectrum, we are able to estimate the stellar velocity dispersion, sigma=268+/-59 km/s. This velocity dispersion is consistent with that of massive galaxies today, implying no significant evolution in stellar velocity dispersion over the last 12 Gyr. Based on a stringent upper limit on its physical size from deep optical images (r{\_}eff{\textless}1.3 kpc), we find that its dynamical mass is consistent with the stellar mass inferred from photometry. Furthermore, the galaxy is located on the mass fundamental plane extrapolated from lower redshift galaxies. Combining all these results, we find that the velocity dispersion does not significantly evolve with redshift, although the size and mass of massive quenched galaxies do. This suggests that the mass in the core of massive galaxies does not evolve significantly, while most of the mass growth occurs in the outskirts of the galaxies, which also increases the size. This picture is consistent with a two-phase formation scenario in which mass and size growth is due to accretion in the outskirts of galaxies via mergers.},

abstract = {Absolute magnitudes in the B, V, and I bands are derived for nine well-observed Type Ia supernovae, using host galaxy distances estimated via the surface brightness fluctuations or Tully-Fisher methods. These data indicate that there is a significant intrinsic dispersion in the absolute magnitudes at maximum light of Type Ia supernovae, amounting to +/- 0.8 mag in B, +/- 0.6 mag in V, and +/- 0.5 mag in I. Moreover, the absolute magnitudes appear to be tightly correlated with the initial rate of decline of the B light curve, with the slope of the correlation being steepest in B and becoming progressively flatter in the V and I bands. This implies that the intrinsic B - V colors of Type Ia supernovae at maximum light are not identical, with the fastest declining light curves corresponding to the intrinsically reddest events. Certain spectroscopic properties may also be correlated with the initial decline rate. These results are most simply interpreted as evidence for a range of progenitor masses, although variations in the explosion mechanism are also possible. Considerable care must be exercised in employing Type Ia supernovae as cosmological standard candles, particularly at large redshifts where Malmquist bias could be an important effect.},

We find that the fraction of galaxies showing inside-out quenching increases with halo mass, irrespective of stellar mass or galaxy type (satellites vs. centrals). In addition, high stellar mass galaxies exhibit a greater fraction of inside-out quenching compared to low stellar mass ones in all environments. In contrast, the fraction of outside-in quenching does not depend on halo mass. Our results suggest that morphological quenching may be responsible for the inside-out quenching seen in all environments. On the other hand, the flat dependence of the outside-in quenching on halo mass could be a mixed result of ram-pressure stripping and galaxy mergers. Nevertheless, at a given environment and stellar mass, the fraction of inside-out quenching is systematically greater than that of outside-in quenching, suggesting that inside-out quenching is the dominant quenching mode in all environments.},

abstract = {Abstract To be habitable, a world (planet or moon) does not need to be located in the stellar habitable zone (HZ), and worlds in the HZ are not necessarily habitable. Here, we illustrate how tidal heating can render terrestrial or icy worlds habitable beyond the stellar HZ. Scientists have developed a language that neglects the possible existence of worlds that offer more benign environments to life than Earth does. We call these objects "superhabitable" and discuss in which contexts this term could be used, that is to say, which worlds tend to be more habitable than Earth. In an appendix, we show why the principle of mediocracy cannot be used to logically explain why Earth should be a particularly habitable planet or why other inhabited worlds should be Earth-like. Superhabitable worlds must be considered for future follow-up observations of signs of extraterrestrial life. Considering a range of physical effects, we conclude that they will tend to be slightly older and more massive than Earth and that their host stars will likely be K dwarfs. This makes Alpha Centauri B, which is a member of the closest stellar system to the Sun and is supposed to host an Earth-mass planet, an ideal target for searches for a superhabitable world.

Even under absolutely minimal assumptions - no disruption of GCs and no reduction in GC stellar mass from early times to the present - GC star formation contributes non-negligibly to the UVLF at luminosities that are accessible to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST; {\$}M{\_}{\{}1500{\}} \backslashapprox -17{\$}). The derived GC UVLFs are Schechter-like in shape even though the underlying {\$}z=0{\$} GC stellar mass functions are log-normal; the Schechter parameters are directly related to the time evolution of UV output from a specified stellar population, evolutionary processes affecting the stellar masses of GCs, and the duration of the GC formation epoch. If the stellar masses of GCs were significantly higher in the past, as is predicted by most models explaining GC chemical anomalies, then GCs dominate the UV emission from many galaxies in existing deep-field observations. On the other hand, it is difficult to reconcile observed UVLFS with models requiring stellar masses at birth that exceed present-day stellar masses by more than a factor of 10. The James Webb Space Telescope will be able to directly detect individual GCs at {\$}z \backslashsim 6{\$} in essentially all bright galaxies, and many galaxies below the knee of the UVLF, for most of the scenarios considered here. The properties of a subset of high-{\$}z{\$} galaxies with {\$}-19 \backslashlesssim M{\_}{\{}1500{\}} \backslashlesssim -14{\$} in HST lensing fields indicate that they may actually be GCs in formation.},

abstract = {Context. Passive galaxies at high redshift are much smaller than equally massive early types today. If this size evolution is caused by stochastic merging processes, then a small fraction of the compact galaxies should persist until today. Up to now it has not been possible to systematically identify the existence of such objects in Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). Aims. We aim at finding potential survivors of these compact galaxies in SDSS, as targets for more detailed follow-up observations. Methods. From the virial theorem, it is expected that for a given mass, compact galaxies have stellar velocity dispersion higher than the mean owing to their smaller sizes. Therefore velocity dispersion, coupled with size (or mass), is an appropriate method of selecting relics, independent of the stellar population properties. Based on these considerations, we designed a set of criteria the use the distribution of early-type galaxies from SDSS on the log{\^{a}}€‰ {\textless}inf{\textgreater}10{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}(R{\textless}inf{\textgreater}0{\textless}/inf{\textgreater})-log {\textless}inf{\textgreater}10{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}($\sigma${\textless}inf{\textgreater}0{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) plane to find the most extreme objects on it. We thus selected compact massive galaxy candidates by restricting them to high velocity dispersions $\sigma${\textless}inf{\textgreater}0{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}{\textgreater} 323.2 km s{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} and small sizes R{\textless}inf{\textgreater}0{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}{\textless} 2.18 kpc. Results. We find 76 galaxies at 0.05 {\textless}z{\textless} 0.2, which have properties that are similar to the typical quiescent galaxies at high redshift. We discuss how these galaxies relate to average present-day early-type galaxies. We study how well these galaxies fit on well-known local universe relations of early-type galaxies, such as the fundamental plane, the red sequence, or mass-size relations. As expected from the selection criteria, the candidates are located in an extreme corner of the mass-size plane. However, they do not extend as deeply into the so-called zone of exclusion as some of the red nuggets found at high redshift, since they are a factor 2-3 less massive on a given intrinsic scale size. Several of our candidates are close to the size resolution limit of SDSS, but are not so small that they are classified as point sources. We find that our candidates are systematically offset on a scaling relation compared to the average early-type galaxies, but still within the general range of other early-type galaxies. Furthermore, our candidates are similar to the mass-size range expected for passive evolution of the red nuggets from their high redshift to the present. Conclusions. The 76 selected candidates form an appropriate set of objects for further follow-up observations. They do not constitute a separate population of peculiar galaxies, but form the extreme tail of a continuous distribution of early-type galaxies. We argue that selecting a high-velocity dispersion is the best way to find analogues of compact high redshift galaxies in the local universe.},

The zCOSMOS survey consists of two parts: (1) zCOSMOSbright, a magnitude-limited I-band I AB {\textless} 22.5 sample of about 20,000 galaxies with 0.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.2 covering the whole 1.7 deg 2 COSMOS ACS field, for which the survey parameters at z ∼ 0.7 are designed to be directly comparable to those of the 2dFGRS at z ∼ 0.1 ; and (2) zCOSMOS-deep, a survey of approximately 10,000 galaxies selected through color-selection criteria to have 1.4 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.0, within the central 1 deg 2. This paper describes the survey design and the construction of the target catalogs and briefly outlines the observational program and the data pipeline. In the first observing season, spectra of 1303 zCOSMOS-bright targets and 977 zCOSMOS-deep targets have been obtained. These are briefly analyzed to demonstrate the characteristics that may be expected from zCOSMOS, and particularly zCOSMOS-bright, when it is finally completed between 2008 and 2009. The power of combining spectroscopic and photometric redshifts is demonstrated, especially in correctly identifying the emission line in single-line spectra and in determining which of the less reliable spectroscopic redshifts are correct and which are incorrect. These techniques bring the overall success rate in the zCOSMOS-bright so far to almost 90{\%} and to above 97{\%} in the 0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.8 redshift range. Our zCOSMOS-deep spectra demonstrate the power of our selection techniques to isolate high-redshift galaxies at 1.4 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.0 and of VIMOS to measure their redshifts using ultraviolet absorption lines. {\textcopyright} 2007.

abstract = {Context. The conditions that a planet must fulfill to be habitable are not precisely known. However, it is comparatively easier to define conditions under which a planet is very likely not habitable. Finding such conditions is important as it can help select, in an ensemble of potentially observable planets, which ones should be observed in greater detail for characterization studies. Aims: Assuming, as in the Earth, that the presence of a C-cycle is a necessary condition for long-term habitability, we derive, as a function of the planetary mass, a radius above which a planet is likely not habitable. We compute the maximum radius a planet can have to fulfill two constraints: surface conditions compatible with the existence of liquid water, and no ice layer at the bottom of a putative global ocean. We demonstrate that, above a given radius, these two constraints cannot be met. Methods: We compute internal structure models of planets, using a five-layer model (core, inner mantle, outer mantle, ocean, and atmosphere), for different masses and composition of the planets (in particular, the Fe/Si ratio of the planet). Results: Our results show that for planets in the super-Earth mass range (1-12 M⊕), the maximum that a planet, with a composition similar to that of the Earth, can have varies between 1.7 and 2.2 R⊕. This radius is reduced when considering planets with higher Fe/Si ratios and taking radiation into account when computing the gas envelope structure. Conclusions: These results can be used to infer, from radius and mass determinations using high-precision transit observations like those that will soon be performed by the CHaracterizing ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS), which planets are very likely not habitable, and therefore which ones should be considered as best targets for further habitability studies.},

abstract = {We aim to determine the mass, velocity anisotropy, and pseudo phase-space density profiles (M(r), beta(r), and Q(r), respectively) of clusters of galaxies at the highest redshifts investigated in detail so far. We combine the GOGREEN and GCLASS spectroscopic data-sets for 14 clusters with mass M200 {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}14 Msolar at redshifts 0.9 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.4. We stack these 14 clusters into an ensemble cluster of 581 member galaxies with stellar mass {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}9.5 M{\_}solar. We use the MAMPOSSt method and the inversion of the Jeans equation technique to determine M(r) and beta(r). We then combine the results of the M(r) and beta(r) analysis to determine Q(r) for the ensemble cluster. The concentration c200 of the ensemble cluster M(r) is in excellent agreement with predictions from LambdaCDM cosmological numerical simulations, and with previous determinations for clusters of similar mass and at similar redshifts, obtained from gravitational lensing and X-ray data. We see no significant difference between the total mass density and either the galaxy number density distributions or the stellar mass distribution. Star-forming galaxies are spatially significantly less concentrated than quiescent galaxies. The orbits of cluster galaxies are isotropic near the center and more radial outside. Star-forming galaxies and galaxies of low stellar mass tend to move on more radially elongated orbits than quiescent galaxies and galaxies of high stellar mass. Q(r), determined either using the total mass or the number density profile, is very close to the power-law behavior predicted by numerical simulations. The internal dynamics of clusters at the highest redshift probed in detail so far are very similar to those of lower-redshift clusters, and in excellent agreement with predictions of numerical simulations. The clusters in our sample have already reached a high degree of dynamical relaxation. (Abridged)},

The first source, CEERS 1670 at {\$}z=5.242{\$}, is 2-3 dex fainter than known quasars at similar redshifts and was previously identified as a candidate low-luminosity AGN based on its rest-frame optical SED. We measure a BH mass of {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm BH{\}}=1.3\backslashpm0.4\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}7{\}}{\~{}}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, confirming that this AGN is powered by the least-massive BH known in the universe at the end of cosmic reionization. The second source, CEERS 3210 at {\$}z=5.624{\$}, is inferred to be a heavily obscured, broad-line AGN caught in a transition phase between a dust-obscured starburst and an unobscured quasar. We estimate its BH mass to be {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm BH{\}}\backslashsimeq 0.9-4.7 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}7{\}}{\~{}}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, depending on the level of dust obscuration assumed. We derive host stellar masses, {\$}M{\_}\backslashstar{\$}, allowing us to place constraints on the BH-galaxy mass relationship in the lowest mass range yet probed in the early universe. The {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm BH{\}}/M{\_}\backslashstar{\$} ratio for CEERS 1670, in particular, is consistent with or higher than the empirical relationship seen in massive galaxies at {\$}z=0{\$}. We examine the emission-line ratios of both sources and find that their location on the BPT and OHNO diagrams is consistent with model predictions for low-metallicity AGN with {\$}Z/Z{\_}\backslashodot \backslashsimeq 0.2-0.4{\$}. The spectroscopic identification of low-luminosity, broad-line AGN at {\$}z{\textgreater}5{\$} with {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm BH{\}}\backslashsimeq 10{\^{}}{\{}7{\}}{\~{}}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} demonstrates the capability of JWST to push BH masses closer to the range predicted for the BH seed population and provides a unique opportunity to study the early stages of BH-galaxy assembly.},

abstract = {We measure spectral indexes for 1823 galaxies in the Canadian Network for Observational Cosmology 1 (CNOC1) sample of 15 X-ray luminous clusters at 0.18{\textless}z{\textless}0.55 to investigate the mechanisms responsible for differential evolution between galaxy cluster and field environments. The radial trends of D4000, W0(Hdelta), and W0(O II) are all consistent with an age sequence, in the sense that the last episode of star formation occurred more recently in galaxies farthest from the cluster center. Throughout the cluster environment, galaxies show evidence for older stellar populations than field galaxies; they have weaker W0(O II) and W0(Hdelta) lines and stronger D4000 indexes. From our primary sample of 1413 galaxies, statistically corrected for incompleteness and selection effects, we identify a sample of K+A galaxies, which have strong Hdelta absorption lines [W0(Hdelta){\textgreater}5 {\AA}] but no [O II] emission [W0(O II){\textless}5 {\AA}], perhaps indicative of recently terminated star formation. The observed fraction of 4.4{\%}+/-0.7{\%} in the cluster sample is an overestimate due to a systematic effect that results from the large uncertainties on individual spectral index measurements. Corrected for this bias, we estimate that K+A galaxies make up only 2.1{\%}+/-0.7{\%} of the cluster sample and 0.1{\%}+/-0.7{\%} of the field. From the subsample of galaxies more luminous than Mr=-18.8+5logh, which is statistically representative of a complete sample to this limit, the corrected fraction of K+A galaxies is 1.5{\%}+/-0.8{\%} in the cluster and 1.2{\%}+/-0.8{\%} in the field. Compared with the z{\~{}}0.1 fraction of 0.30{\%}, the fraction of K+A galaxies in the CNOC1 field sample is greater by perhaps a factor of 4, but with only 1 sigma significance; no further evolution of this fraction is detectable over our redshift range. We compare our data with the results of PEGASE and GISSEL96 spectrophotometric models and conclude, from the relative fractions of red and blue galaxies with no [O II] lambda3727 emission and strong Hdelta absorption, that up to 1.9{\%}+/-0.8{\%} of the cluster population may have had its star formation recently truncated without a starburst. However, this is still not significantly greater than the fraction of such galaxies in the field, 3.1{\%}+/-1.0{\%}. Furthermore, we do not detect an excess of cluster galaxies that have unambiguously undergone starbursts within the last 1 Gyr. In fact, at 6.3{\%}+/-2.1{\%}, the A+em galaxies that Poggianti et al. have recently suggested are dusty starbursts are twice as common in the field as in the cluster environment. Our results imply that these cluster environments are not responsible for inducing starbursts; thus, the increase in cluster blue galaxy fraction with redshift may not be a strictly cluster-specific phenomenon. We suggest that the truncation of star formation in clusters may largely be a gradual process, perhaps due to the exhaustion of gas in the galactic disks over fairly long timescales; in this case differential evolution may result because field galaxies can refuel their disks with gas from extended halos, thus regenerating star formation, while cluster galaxies may not have such halos and so continue to evolve passively.},

abstract = {We make use of deep 1.2mm-continuum observations (12.7microJy/beam RMS) of a 1 arcmin{\^{}}2 region in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field to probe dust-enshrouded star formation from 330 Lyman-break galaxies spanning the redshift range z=2-10 (to {\~{}}2-3 Msol/yr at 1sigma over the entire range). Given the depth and area of ASPECS, we would expect to tentatively detect 35 galaxies extrapolating the Meurer z{\~{}}0 IRX-beta relation to z{\textgreater}{\~{}}2 (assuming T{\_}d{\~{}}35 K). However, only 6 tentative detections are found at z{\textgreater}{\~{}}2 in ASPECS, with just three at {\textgreater}3sigma. Subdividing z=2-10 galaxies according to stellar mass, UV luminosity, and UV-continuum slope and stacking the results, we only find a significant detection in the most massive ({\textgreater}10{\^{}}9.75 Msol) subsample, with an infrared excess (IRX=L{\_}{\{}IR{\}}/L{\_}{\{}UV{\}}) consistent with previous z{\~{}}2 results. However, the infrared excess we measure from our large selection of sub-L* ({\textless}10{\^{}}9.75 Msol) galaxies is 0.11(-0.42)(+0.32) and 0.14(-0.14)(+0.15) at z=2-3 and z=4-10, respectively, lying below even an SMC IRX-beta relation (95{\%} confidence). These results demonstrate the relevance of stellar mass for predicting the IR luminosity of z{\textgreater}{\~{}}2 galaxies. We furthermore find that the evolution of the IRX-stellar mass relationship depends on the evolution of the dust temperature. If the dust temperature increases monotonically with redshift (as (1+z){\^{}}0.32) such that T{\_}d{\~{}}44-50 K at z{\textgreater}=4, current results are suggestive of little evolution in this relationship to z{\~{}}6. We use these results to revisit recent estimates of the z{\textgreater}{\~{}}3 SFR density. One less obvious implication is in interpreting the high Halpha EWs seen in z{\~{}}5 galaxies: our results imply that star-forming galaxies produce Lyman-continuum photons at twice the efficiency (per unit UV luminosity) as implied in conventional models. Star-forming galaxies can then reionize the Universe, even if the escape fraction is {\textless}10{\%}.},

The interpretation of this result for dust-poor z {\~{}} 0 galaxies is that regions with ionizing stars have more dust than regions with nonionizing UV-emitting stars. Dust distributions for these galaxies are nonuniform. The interpretation of the overestimates for dusty galaxies at both redshifts is less clear. If the attenuation formula is inapplicable to these galaxies, perhaps the disagreements are unphysical; perhaps dust distributions in these galaxies are uniform.

abstract = {In this paper, we demonstrate a new method for fitting galaxy profiles which makes use of the full multi-wavelength data provided by modern large optical-near-infrared imaging surveys. We present a new version of GALAPAGOS, which utilises a recently-developed multi-wavelength version of GALFIT, and enables the automated measurement of wavelength dependent S$\backslash$'ersic profile parameters for very large samples of galaxies. Our new technique is extensively tested to assess the reliability of both pieces of software, GALFIT and GALAPAGOS on both real ugrizY JHK imaging data from the GAMA survey and simulated data made to the same specifications. We find that fitting galaxy light profiles with multi-wavelength data increases the stability and accuracy of the measured parameters, and hence produces more complete and meaningful multi-wavelength photometry than has been available previously. The improvement is particularly significant for magnitudes in low S/N bands and for structural parameters like half-light radius re and S$\backslash$'ersic index n for which a prior is used by constraining these parameters to a polynomial as a function of wavelength. This allows the fitting routines to push the magnitude of galaxies for which sensible values can be derived to fainter limits. The technique utilises a smooth transition of galaxy parameters with wavelength, creating more physically meaningful transitions than single-band fitting and allows accurate interpolation between passbands, perfect for derivation of rest-frame values.},

abstract = {In this review we discuss the evidence for galaxy interactions and mergers in the distant universe and the role of mergers in forming galaxies. Observations show that the fraction of massive (M{\textgreater}M*) galaxies involved in major mergers is roughly 510{\%} at z∼1. The merger fraction however increases steeply for the most massive galaxies up to z∼3, where the merger fraction is 50 20{\%}. Using N-body models of the galaxy merger process at a variety of merger conditions, merger mass ratios, and viewing angles this merger fraction can be converted into a merger rate, and mass accretion rate due to mergers. A simple integration of the merger rate shows that a typical massive galaxy at z∼3 will undergo 45 major mergers between z∼3 and z∼0, with most of this activity, and resulting mass assembly, occurring at z{\textgreater}1.5. {\textcopyright} 2007 International Astronomical Union.},

abstract = {It is thought that a class of broad absorption line (BAL) QSOs, characterized by Fe absorption features in their UV spectra (called 'FeLoBALs'), could mark a transition stage between the end of an obscured starburst event and a youthful QSO beginning to shed its dust cocoon, where Fe has been injected into the interstellar medium by the starburst. To test this hypothesis, we have undertaken deep Submillimetre Common-User Bolometer Array 2 (SCUBA-2) 850 $\mu$m observations of a sample of 17 FeLoBAL QSOs with 0.89 ≤ z ≤ 2.78 and -23.31 ≤ MB ≤ -28.50 to directly detect an excess in the thermal emission of the dust which would probe enhanced star formation activity. We find that FeLoBALs are not luminous sources in the sub-mm, none of them are individually detected at 850 $\mu$m, nor as a population through stacking (Fs = 1.14 ± 0.58 mJy). Statistical and survival analyses reveal that FeLoBALs have sub-mm properties consistent with BAL and non-BAL QSOs with matched redshifts and magnitudes. An Spectral Energy Distribution fitting analysis shows that the far-infrared emission is dominated by active galactic nuclei activity, and a starburst component is required only in 6/17 sources of our sample; moreover the integrated total luminosity of 16/17 sources is L ≥ 1012 L⊙, high enough to classify FeLoBALs as infrared luminous. In conclusion, we do not find any evidence in support of FeLoBAL QSOs being a transition population between an ultraluminous infrared galaxy (ULIRG) and an unobscured QSO; in particular, FeLoBALs are not characterized by a cold starburst which would support this hypothesis.},

From the CO(J=1-0) line strengths, we measure total cold molecular gas masses of M{\_}gas = 2.4-11.6 x 10{\^{}}10 (alpha{\_}CO/3.6) Msun. We also measure a median CO(J=3-2) to CO(J=1-0) line brightness temperature ratio of r{\_}31 = 0.84 +/- 0.26, and a CO(J=7-6) to CO(J=1-0) ratio range of r{\_}71 {\textless}0.05 to 0.17. These results suggest that CO(J=3-2) selected galaxies may have a higher CO line excitation on average than CO(J=1-0) selected galaxies, based on the limited, currently available samples from the ASPECS and VLA CO Luminosity Density at High Redshift (COLDz) surveys. This implies that previous estimates of the cosmic density of cold gas in galaxies based on CO(J=3-2) measurements should be revised down by a factor of {\~{}}=2 on average based on assumptions regarding CO excitation alone. This correction further improves the agreement between the best currently existing constraints on the cold gas density evolution across cosmic history from line scan surveys, and the implied characteristic gas depletion times.},

abstract = {We investigate the stellar populations for a sample of 24 quiescent galaxies at 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5 using deep rest-frame optical spectra obtained with Keck MOSFIRE. By fitting templates simultaneously to the spectroscopic and photometric data, and exploring a variety of star formation histories, we obtain robust measurements of median stellar ages and residual levels of star formation. After subtracting the stellar templates, the stacked spectrum reveals the Halpha and [NII] emission lines, providing an upper limit on the ongoing star formation rate of 0.9 +/- 0.1 Msun/yr. By combining the MOSFIRE data to our sample of Keck LRIS spectra at lower redshift, we analyze in a consistent manner the quiescent population at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5. We find a tight relation (with a scatter of 0.13 dex) between the stellar age and the rest-frame U-V and V-J colors, which can be used to estimate the age of quiescent galaxies given their colors. Applying this age--color relation to large, photometric samples, we are able to model the number density evolution for quiescent galaxies of various ages. We find evidence for two distinct quenching paths: a fast quenching that produces compact post-starburst systems, and a slow quenching of larger galaxies. Fast quenching accounts for about a fifth of the growth of the red sequence at z{\~{}}1.4, and half at z{\~{}}2.2. We conclude that fast quenching is triggered by dramatic events such as gas-rich mergers, while slow quenching is likely caused by a different physical mechanism.},

abstract = {Understanding the rate at which stars form is central to studies of galaxy formation. Observationally, the star formation rates (SFRs) of galaxies are measured using the luminosity in different frequency bands, often under the assumption of a time-steady SFR in the recent past. We use star formation histories (SFHs) extracted from cosmological simulations of star-forming galaxies from the FIRE project to analyze the time-scales to which the H{\$}{\{}\backslashalpha{\}}{\$} and far-ultraviolet (FUV) continuum SFR indicators are sensitive. In these simulations, the SFRs are highly time variable for all galaxies at high redshift, and continue to be bursty to z=0 in dwarf galaxies. When FIRE SFHs are partitioned into their bursty and time-steady phases, the best-fitting FUV time-scale fluctuates from its {\~{}}10 Myr value when the SFR is time-steady to {\textgreater}{\~{}}100 Myr immediately following particularly extreme bursts of star formation during the bursty phase. On the other hand, the best-fitting averaging time-scale for H{\$}{\{}\backslashalpha{\}}{\$} is generally insensitive to the SFR variability in the FIRE simulations and remains {\~{}}5 Myr at all times. These time-scales are shorter than the 100 Myr and 10 Myr time-scales sometimes assumed in the literature for FUV and H{\$}{\{}\backslashalpha{\}}{\$}, respectively, because while the FUV emission persists for stellar populations older than 100 Myr, the time-dependent luminosities are strongly dominated by younger stars. Our results confirm that the ratio of SFRs inferred using H{\$}{\{}\backslashalpha{\}}{\$} vs. FUV can be used to probe the burstiness of star formation in galaxies.},

abstract = {We examine the spheroid growth and star formation quenching experienced by galaxies from z{\~{}}3 to the present by studying the evolution with redshift of the quiescent and spheroid-dominated fractions of galaxies from the CANDELS and GAMA surveys. We compare the observed fractions with predictions from a semi-analytic model which includes prescriptions for bulge growth and AGN feedback due to mergers and disk instabilities. We facilitate direct morphological comparison by converting our model bulge-to-total stellar mass ratios to Sersic indices. We then subdivide our population into the four quadrants of the sSFR-Sersic index plane and study the buildup of each of these subpopulations. We find that the fraction of star forming disks declines steadily, while the fraction of quiescent spheroids builds up over cosmic time. The fractions of star forming spheroids and quiescent disks are both non-negligible, and stay nearly constant over the period we have studied, at about 10{\%} and 15-20{\%} respectively. Our model is qualitatively successful at reproducing the evolution of the two "main" populations (star forming disk-dominated galaxies and quiescent spheroid-dominated galaxies), and approximately reproduces the relative fractions of all four types, but predicts a stronger decline in star forming spheroids, and increase in quiescent disks, than seen in the observations. A model with an additional channel for bulge growth via disk instabilities agrees better overall with the observations than a model in which bulges may grow only through mergers. We study evolutionary tracks of some individual galaxies as they experience morphological transformation and quenching, and examine the importance of different physical drivers of this transformation (major and minor mergers and disk instabilities). We find that complex histories with multiple transformative events are the norm.},

In addition to this signal generated by Doppler boosting of the CMB monopole, our motion also modulates and aberrates the CMB temperature fluctuations (as well as every other source of radiation at cosmological distances). This is an order 0.1{\%} effect applied to fluctuations which are already one part in roughly one hundred thousand, so it is quite small. Nevertheless, it becomes detectable with the all-sky coverage, high angular resolution, and low noise levels of the Planck satellite. Here we report a first measurement of this velocity signature using the aberration and modulation effects on the CMB temperature anisotropies, finding a component in the known dipole direction, (l,b)=(264, 48) [deg], of 384km/s +- 78km/s (stat.) +- 115km/s (syst.).

abstract = {To compare photometric properties of galaxies at different redshifts, the fluxes need to be corrected for the changes of effective rest-frame wavelengths of filter bandpasses, called K-corrections. Usual approaches to compute them are based on the template fitting of observed spectral energy distributions (SED) and, thus, require multi-colour photometry. Here, we demonstrate that, in cases of widely used optical and near-infrared filters, K-corrections can be precisely approximated as two-dimensional low-order polynomials of only two parameters: redshift and one observed colour. With this minimalist approach, we present the polynomial fitting functions for K-corrections in SDSS ugriz, UKIRT WFCAM YJHK, Johnson-Cousins UBVR{\_}cI{\_}c, and 2MASS JHK{\_}s bands for galaxies at redshifts Z{\textless}0.5 based on empirically-computed values obtained by fitting combined optical-NIR SEDs of a set of 10{\^{}}5 galaxies constructed from SDSS DR7 and UKIDSS DR5 photometry using the Virtual Observatory. For luminous red galaxies we provide K-corrections as functions of their redshifts only. In two filters, g and r, we validate our solutions by computing K-corrections directly from SDSS DR7 spectra. We also present a K-corrections calculator, a web-based service for computing K-corrections on-line.},

MPFIT inherits the robustness of the original FORTRAN version of MINPACK-1, but is optimized for performance and convenience in IDL. In addition to the main fitting engine, MPFIT, several specialized functions are provided to fit 1-D curves and 2-D images; 1-D and 2-D peaks; and interactive fitting from the IDL command line. Several constraints can be applied to model parameters, including fixed constraints, simple bounding constraints, and "tying" the value to another parameter. Several data weighting methods are allowed, and the parameter covariance matrix is computed. Extensive diagnostic capabilities are available during the fit, via a call-back subroutine, and after the fit is complete. Several different forms of documentation are provided, including a tutorial, reference pages, and frequently asked questions. The package has been translated to C and Python as well.

This is 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than coeval star-forming galaxies at similar stellar mass, and comparable to galaxies at {\$}z=0{\$} with similarly low sSFR.

The implied rapid depletion time of molecular gas (t{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}dep{\}}{\}}{\textless}0.6{\$} Gyr) disagrees with extrapolations of empirical scaling relations to low sSFR. We find that our low gas fractions are instead in agreement with predictions from both the recent SIMBA cosmological simulation, and from analytical "bathtub" models for gas accretion onto galaxies in massive dark matter halos (log{\$}{\_}{\{}10{\}}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}halo{\}}{\}}/\backslashrm{\{}M{\}}{\_}\backslashodot\backslashsim14{\$} at {\$}z=0{\$}).

Our data is consistent with a simple picture where galaxies truncate accretion and then consume the existing gas at or faster than typical main sequence rates. Alternatively, we cannot rule out that these galaxies reside in lower mass halos, and low gas fractions may instead reflect either stronger feedback, or more efficient gas consumption.},

The sample was selected in the far-IR, at $\backslash$lambda=100 and/or 160 $\backslash$mu m, and only includes galaxies with a secure H$\backslash$alpha detection (S/N{\textgreater}3). From the low resolution 3D-HST spectra we measured z and F(H$\backslash$alpha) for the whole sample, rescaling the observed flux by a constant factor of 1.2 to remove the contamination by [NII]. The stellar masses, infrared and UV luminosities were derived from the SEDs by fitting multi-band data from GALEX near-UV to SPIRE500 $\backslash$mu m. We derived the continuum extinction Estar(B-V) from both the IRX ratio and the UV-slope, and found an excellent agreement among them. Galaxies in the sample have 2.6x10{\^{}}9{\$}\backslashleq{\$}M*{\$}\backslashleq{\$}3.5x10{\^{}}11 Msun, intense infrared luminosity (L{\_}IR{\textgreater}1.2x10{\^{}}10 Lsun), high level of dust obscuration (0.1{\$}\backslashleq{\$}Estar(B-V){\$}\backslashleq{\$}1.1) and strong H$\backslash$alpha emission (typical observed fluxes Fobs(H$\backslash$alpha){\$}\backslashgeq{\$}4.1x10{\^{}}-17 erg/s/cm2).

We obtained f=Estar(B-V)/Eneb(B-V)=0.93{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.06, i.e. higher than the value measured in the local Universe. This result could be partially due to the adopted selection criteria, picking up the most obscured but also the H$\backslash$alpha brightest sources. The derived dust correction produces a good agreement between H$\backslash$alpha and IR+UV SFRs for objects with SFR{\$}\backslashgtrsim{\$}20 Msun/yr and M*{\$}\backslashgtrsim{\$}5x10{\^{}}10 Msun, while sources with lower SFR and M* seem to require a smaller f-factor (i.e. higher H$\backslash$alpha extinction correction). Our results then imply that for our sample the nebular and optical-UV extinctions are comparable and suggest that the f-factor is a function of both M* and SFR, according with previous studies.},

The treatment of dust extinction and re-emission has been carried out by means of the radiative transfer calculation. The spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting technique is performed by using GOSSIP+, a tool able to combine both photometric and spectroscopic information to extract the best value of the physical quantities of interest, and to consider the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) attenuation as a free parameter. We find that the main contribution to the scatter observed in the {\$}SFR-M{\_}{\{}*{\}}{\$} plane is the possibility of choosing between different families of SFHs in the SED fitting procedure, while the redshift range plays a minor role. The majority of the galaxies, at all cosmic times, are best-fit by models with SFHs characterized by a high {\$}\backslashtau{\_}{\{}\backslashrm infall{\}}/\backslashnu{\$} ratio.

abstract = {Stellar population synthesis (SPS) provides the link between the stellar and dust content of galaxies and their observed spectral energy distributions. In the present work we perform a comprehensive calibration of our own flexible SPS (FSPS) model against a suite of data. Several public SPS models are intercompared, including the models of Bruzual {\&} Charlot (BC03), Maraston (M05) and FSPS. The relative strengths and weaknesses of these models are evaluated, with the following conclusions: 1) The FSPS and BC03 models compare favorably with MC data at all ages, whereas M05 colors are too red and the age-dependence is incorrect; 2) All models yield similar optical and near-IR colors for old metal-poor systems, and yet they all provide poor fits to the integrated J-K and V-K colors of both MW and M31 star clusters; 4) All models predict ugr colors too red, D4000 strengths too strong and Hdelta strengths too weak compared to massive red sequence galaxies, under the assumption that such galaxies are composed solely of old metal-rich stars; 5) FSPS and, to a lesser extent, BC03 can reproduce the optical and near-IR colors of post-starburst galaxies, while M05 cannot. Reasons for these discrepancies are explored. The failure at predicting the ugr colors, D4000, and Hdelta strengths can be explained by some combination of a minority population of metal-poor stars, young stars, blue straggler and/or blue horizontal branch stars, but not by appealing to inadequacies in either theoretical stellar atmospheres or canonical evolutionary phases (e.g., the main sequence turn-off). We emphasize that due to a lack of calibrating star cluster data in regions of the metallicity-age plane relevant for galaxies, all of these models continue to suffer from serious uncertainties that are difficult to quantify.

In this work, we perform a case study on the AGN-host galaxy candidate COS-87259 with spectroscopic redshift {\$}z{\_}{\{}\backslashrm spec{\}}=6.853{\$}, that is claimed to have an extremely high stellar mass of {\$}\backslashlog(M{\_}*/M{\_}\backslashodot) \backslashsim 11.2{\$}. We test a suite of different SED fitting algorithms and stellar population models on our independently measured photometry in 17 broad bands for this source. Between five different code set-ups, the stellar mass estimates for COS-87259 span {\$}\backslashlog(M{\_}*/M{\_}\backslashodot) = 10.24{\$}--11.00, whilst the reduced {\$}\backslashchi{\^{}}2{\$} values of the fits are all close to unity within {\$}\backslashDelta\backslashchi{\^{}}2{\_}\backslashnu=0.9{\$}, so that the quality of the SED fits is basically indistinguishable. Only the Bayesian inference code Prospector using a non-parametric star formation history model yields a stellar mass exceeding {\$}\backslashlog(M{\_}*/M{\_}\backslashodot)=11{\$}. As this SED fitting prescription is becoming increasingly popular for James Webb Space Telescope high-redshift science, we stress the absolute importance to test various SED fitting routines particularly on apparently very massive galaxies at such high redshifts. Ultimately, we conclude that the extremely high stellar mass estimate for COS-87259 is not necessary, deriving equally good fits with stellar masses {\$}\backslashsim 1{\$} dex lower.},

abstract = {We present Keck LRIS spectroscopy for a sample of 103 massive (M {\textgreater} 1010.6M) galaxies with redshifts 0.9 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.6. Of these, 56 are quiescent with high signal-to-noise absorption line spectra, enabling us to determine robust stellar velocity dispersions for the largest sample yet available beyond a redshift of 1. Together with effective radii measured from deep Hubble Space Telescope images, we calculate dynamical masses and address key questions relating to the puzzling size growth claimed by many observers for quiescent galaxies over the redshift interval 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 2. Our large sample provides the first opportunity to carefully examine the relationship between stellar and dynamical masses at high redshift. We find this relation closely follows that determined locally. We also confirm the utility of the locally established empirical calibration which enables high-redshift velocity dispersions to be estimated photometrically, and we determine its accuracy to be 35{\%}. To address recent suggestions that progenitor bias - the continued arrival of recently quenched larger galaxies - can largely explain the size evolution of quiescent galaxies, we examine the growth at fixed velocity dispersion assuming this quantity is largely unaffected by the merger history. Using the velocity dispersion-age relation observed in the local universe, we demonstrate that significant size and mass growth have clearly occurred in individual systems. Parameterizing the relation between mass and size growth over 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.6 as RM $\alpha$, we find $\alpha$ = 1.6 ± 0.3, in agreement with theoretical expectations from simulations of minor mergers. Relaxing the assumption that the velocity dispersion is unchanging, we examine growth assuming a constant ranking in galaxy velocity dispersion. This approach is applicable only to the large-dispersion tail of the distribution, but yields a consistent growth rate of $\alpha$ = 1.4 ± 0.2. Both methods confirm that progenitor bias alone is insufficient to explain our new observations and that quiescent galaxies have grown in both size and stellar mass over 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.6. {\textcopyright} 2014.

abstract = {Galaxy mergers are believed to trigger strong starbursts. This is well assessed by observations in the local Universe. However, the efficiency of this mechanism has poorly been tested so far for high-redshift, actively star-forming, galaxies. We present a suite of pc-resolution hydrodynamical numerical simulations to compare the star formation process along a merging sequence of high- and low-redshift galaxies, by varying the gas mass fraction between the two models. We show that, for the same orbit, high-redshift gas-rich mergers are less efficient than low-redshift ones at producing starbursts; the star formation rate excess induced by the merger and its duration are both around 10 times lower than in the low gas fraction case. The mechanisms that account for the star formation triggering at low redshift - the increased compressive turbulence, gas fragmentation, and central gas inflows - are only mildly, if not at all, enhanced for high gas fraction galaxy encounters. Furthermore, we show that the strong stellar feedback from the initially high star formation rate in high-redshift galaxies does not prevent an increase of the star formation during the merger. Our results are consistent with the observed increase of the number of major mergers with increasing redshift being faster than the respective increase in the number of starburst galaxies.},

abstract = {We study the statistical distribution of satellites around star-forming and quiescent central galaxies at 1{\textless}z{\textless}3 using imaging from the FourStar Galaxy Evolution Survey (ZFOURGE) and the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS). The deep near-IR data select satellites down to {\$}\backslashlog(M/M{\_}\backslashodot){\textgreater}9{\$} at z{\textless}3. The radial satellite distribution around centrals is consistent with a projected NFW profile. Massive quiescent centrals, {\$}\backslashlog(M/M{\_}\backslashodot){\textgreater}10.78{\$}, have {\$}\backslashsim{\$}2 times the number of satellites compared to star-forming centrals with a significance of 2.7{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} even after accounting for differences in the centrals' stellar-mass distributions. We find no statistical difference in the satellite distributions of intermediate-mass quiescent and star-forming centrals, {\$}10.48{\textless}\backslashlog(M/M{\_}\backslashodot){\textless}10.78{\$}. Comparing to the Guo2011 semi-analytic model, the excess number of satellites indicates that quiescent centrals have halo masses 0.3 dex larger than star-forming centrals, even when the stellar-mass distributions are fixed. We use a simple toy model that relates halo mass and quenching, which roughly reproduces the observed quenched fractions and the differences in halo mass between star-forming and quenched galaxies only if galaxies have a quenching probability that increases with halo mass from {\$}\backslashsim{\$}0 for {\$}\backslashlog(M{\_}h/M{\_}\backslashodot)\backslashsim{\$}11 to {\$}\backslashsim{\$}1 for {\$}\backslashlog(M{\_}h/M{\_}\backslashodot)\backslashsim{\$}13.5. A single halo-mass quenching threshold is unable to reproduce the quiescent fraction and satellite distribution of centrals. Therefore, while halo quenching may be an important mechanism, it is unlikely to be the only factor driving quenching. It remains unclear why a high fraction of centrals remain star-forming even in relatively massive halos.},

abstract = {Measuring the chemical composition of galaxies is crucial to our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution models. However, such measurements are extremely challenging for quiescent galaxies at high redshifts, which have faint stellar continua and compact sizes, making it difficult to detect absorption lines and nearly impossible to spatially resolve them. Gravitational lensing offers the opportunity to study these galaxies with detailed spectroscopy that can be spatially resolved. In this work, we analyze deep spectra of MRG-M0138, a lensed quiescent galaxy at z = 1.98 which is the brightest of its kind, with an H-band magnitude of 17.1. Taking advantage of full spectral fitting, we measure {\$}[{\{}\backslashrm Mg/Fe{\}}]=0.51\backslashpm0.05{\$}, {\$}[\backslashrm{\{}Fe/H{\}}]=0.26\backslashpm0.04{\$}, and, for the first time, the stellar abundances of 6 other elements in this galaxy. We further constrained, also for the first time in a {\$}z\backslashsim2{\$} galaxy, radial gradients in stellar age, [Fe/H], and [Mg/Fe]. We detect no gradient in age or [Mg/Fe] and a slightly negative gradient in [Fe/H], which has a slope comparable to that seen in local early-type galaxies. Our measurements show that not only is MRG-M0138 very Mg-enhanced compared to the centers of local massive early-type galaxies, it is also very iron rich. These dissimilar abundances suggest that even the inner regions of massive galaxies have experienced significant mixing of stars in mergers, in contrast to a purely inside-out growth model. The abundance pattern observed in MRG-M0138 challenges simple galactic chemical evolution models that vary only the star formation timescale and shows the need for more elaborate models.},

abstract = {For low-redshift cosmology and galaxy formation rates, it is important to account for all the baryons synthesized in the Big Bang. Although galaxies and clusters contain 10{\%} of the baryons, many more reside in the photoionized Lyman-alpha forest and shocked-heated warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) at T = 10{\^{}}5 to 10{\^{}}7 K. Current tracers of WHIM at 10{\^{}}5 to 10{\^{}}6 K include the O VI 1032, 1038 absorption lines, together with broad Lyman-alpha absorbers (BLAs) and EUV/X-ray absorption lines from Ne VIII, O VII, and O VIII. We improve the O VI baryon surveys with corrections for oxygen metallicity (Z/Zsun) and O VI ionization fraction (f{\_}OVI) using cosmological simulations of heating, cooling, and metal transport in a density-temperature structured medium. Statistically, their product correlates with column density, (Z/Zsun)(f{\_}OVI) = (0.015)(N{\_}OVI/10{\^{}}{\{}14{\}} cm{\^{}}-2){\^{}}0.70. The N{\_}OVI-weighted mean is 0.01, which doubles previous estimates of WHIM baryon content. We also reanalyze H I data from the Hubble Space Telescope, applying redshift corrections for absorber density, photoionizing background, and proper length, dl/dz. We find substantial baryon fractions in the photoionized Lya forest (28 +/- 11{\%}), O VI/BLA-traced WHIM (25 +/- 8{\%}), and collapsed phase (18 +/- 4{\%}) in galaxies, groups, clusters, and circumgalactic gas. The baryon shortfall is 29 +/- 13{\%}, which may be detected in X-ray absorbers from hotter WHIM or in weaker Lya and O VI absorbers.

abstract = {We use SDSS+$\backslash$textit{\{}GALEX{\}}+Galaxy Zoo data to study the quenching of star formation in low-redshift galaxies. We show that the green valley between the blue cloud of star-forming galaxies and the red sequence of quiescent galaxies in the colour-mass diagram is not a single transitional state through which most blue galaxies evolve into red galaxies. Rather, an analysis that takes morphology into account makes clear that only a small population of blue early-type galaxies move rapidly across the green valley after the morphologies are transformed from disk to spheroid and star formation is quenched rapidly. In contrast, the majority of blue star-forming galaxies have significant disks, and they retain their late-type morphologies as their star formation rates decline very slowly. We summarize a range of observations that lead to these conclusions, including UV-optical colours and halo masses, which both show a striking dependence on morphological type. We interpret these results in terms of the evolution of cosmic gas supply and gas reservoirs. We conclude that late-type galaxies are consistent with a scenario where the cosmic supply of gas is shut off, perhaps at a critical halo mass, followed by a slow exhaustion of the remaining gas over several Gyr, driven by secular and/or environmental processes. In contrast, early-type galaxies require a scenario where the gas supply and gas reservoir are destroyed virtually instantaneously, with rapid quenching accompanied by a morphological transformation from disk to spheroid. This gas reservoir destruction could be the consequence of a major merger, which in most cases transforms galaxies from disk to elliptical morphology, and mergers could play a role in inducing black hole accretion and possibly AGN feedback.},

abstract = {We present initial results of a survey for star-forming galaxies in the redshift range 3.8{\textless}{\~{}}z{\textless}{\~{}}4.5. This sample consists of a photometric catalog of 244 galaxies culled from a total solid angle of 0.23 deg{\^{}}2 to an apparent magnitude of I{\_}AB=25.0. Spectroscopic redshifts in the range 3.61{\textless}=z{\textless}=4.81 have been obtained for 48 of these galaxies; their median redshift is {\textless}z{\textgreater}=4.13. Selecting these galaxies in a manner entirely analogous to our large survey for Lyman-break galaxies at smaller redshift (2.7{\textless}{\~{}}z{\textless}{\~{}}3.4) allows a relatively clean differential comparison between the populations and integrated luminosity density at these two cosmic epochs. Over the same range of UV luminosity, the spectroscopic properties of the galaxy samples at z{\~{}}4 and z{\~{}}3 are indistinguishable, as are the luminosity function shapes and the total integrated UV luminosity densities [rho{\_}UV(z=3)/rho{\_}UV(z=4)=1.1+/-0.3]. We see no evidence at these bright magnitudes for the steep decline in the star formation density inferred from fainter photometric Lyman-break galaxies in the Hubble deep field (HDF). The HDF provides the only existing data on Lyman-break galaxy number densities at fainter magnitudes. We have reanalyzed the z{\~{}}3 and z{\~{}}4 Lyman-break galaxies in the HDF using our improved knowledge of the spectral energy distributions of these galaxies, and we find, like previous authors, that faint Lyman-break galaxies appear to be rarer at z{\~{}}4 than z{\~{}}3. This might signal a large change in the faint-end slope of the Lyman-break galaxy luminosity function between redshifts z{\~{}}3 and z{\~{}}4, or, more likely, be due to significant variance in the number counts within the small volumes probed by the HDF at high redshifts ({\~{}}160 times smaller than the ground-based surveys discussed here). If the true luminosity density at z{\~{}}4 is somewhat higher than implied by the HDF, as our ground-based sample suggests, then the emissivity of star formation as a function of redshift would appear essentially constant for all z{\textgreater}1 once internally consistent corrections for dust are made. This suggests that there may be no obvious peak in star formation activity and that the onset of substantial star formation in galaxies might occur at z{\textgreater}{\~{}}4.5.},

abstract = {We study the role of cold gas in quenching star formation in the green valley by analysing ALMA {\$}{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}{\$}CO (1-0) observations of three galaxies with resolved optical spectroscopy from the MaNGA survey. We present resolution-matched maps of the star formation rate and molecular gas mass. These data are used to calculate the star formation efficiency (SFE) and gas fraction ({\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\~{}}gas{\}}{\$}) for these galaxies separately in the central `bulge' regions and outer disks. We find that, for the two galaxies whose global specific star formation rate (sSFR) deviates most from the star formation main sequence, the gas fraction in the bulges is significantly lower than that in their disks, supporting an `inside-out' model of galaxy quenching. For the two galaxies where SFE can be reliably determined in the central regions, the bulges and disks share similar SFEs. This suggests that a decline in {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\~{}}gas{\}}{\$} is the main driver of lowered sSFR in bulges compared to disks in green valley galaxies. Within the disks, there exist common correlations between the sSFR and SFE and between sSFR and {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\~{}}gas{\}}{\$} on kpc scales -- the local SFE or {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\~{}}gas{\}}{\$} in the disks declines with local sSFR. Our results support a picture in which the sSFR in bulges is primarily controlled by {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\~{}}gas{\}}{\$}, whereas both SFE and {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\~{}}gas{\}}{\$} play a role in lowering the sSFR in disks. A larger sample is required to confirm if the trend established in this work is representative of green valley as a whole.},

@article{Wang2018,
abstract = {Previous findings show that the existence of dense cores or bulges is the prerequisite for quenching a galaxy, leading to a proposed two-step quenching scenario: compaction and quenching. In this scenario, galaxies first grow their cores to a stellar mass surface density threshold and subsequently quenching occurs, suggesting that galaxies evolve from extended star-forming galaxies (eSFGs), through compact star-forming galaxies (cSFGs), to quenched population. In this work, we aim at examining the possible evolutionary link between eSFGs and cSFGs by identifying the trends in star formation rate (SFR), gas-phase metallicity and HI content, since one would naturally expect that galaxies evolve along the track of cold gas consumption and metal enhancement. We select a volume-limited sample of 15,933 galaxies with stellar mass above {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}9.5{\}}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} and redshift of 0.02 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.05 from the NASA-Sloan-Atlas catalog within the ALFALFA footprint. The cSFGs on average exhibit similar or slightly higher SFRs of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}0.06 dex and significantly higher gas-phase metallicity (up to 0.2 dex at low mass) with respect to the eSFGs, while the cSFGs dominate the galaxy population of the most intense star formation activities. More importantly, overall the median HI content and gas depletion time of cSFGs are about half of eSFGs. Our result supports the compaction and quenching scenario that galaxies evolve and grow their cores along the track of cold gas consumption and metal enhancement. The environments of eSFGs and cSFGs are indistinguishable, suggesting that the compaction process is independent of any environmental effects at least for low-redshift universe.},

Here we derive their ionizing photon production efficiency, $\xi$ ion , a fundamental quantity for inferring the number of photons available to reionize the Universe. This is the first time this is done for galaxies with confirmed strong Lyman continuum escape (f esc ∼ 6–13{\%}). We find an ionizing photon production per unit UV luminosity, $\xi$ ion , that is higher by a factor 2–6 than the canonical value when reported to their observed UV luminosity. After correction for extinction, this value is close to the canonical value. The properties of our five Lyman continuum leakers are found to be very similar to those of the previously reported confirmed z = 3.218 leaker Ion2 and very similar to those of typical star-forming galaxies at z {\textgreater} ∼ 6. Our results suggest that UV bright galaxies at high-z such as Lyman-break galaxies can be Lyman continuum leakers and that their contribution to cosmic reionization may be underestimated.},

abstract = {With a primary goal of conducting precision weak lensing measurements from space, the COSMOS survey has imaged the largest contiguous area observed by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to date using the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS). This is the first paper in a series where we describe our strategy for addressing the various technical challenges in the production of weak lensing measurements from the COSMOS data. The COSMOS ACS catalog is constructed from 575 ACS/WFC tiles (1.64 deg{\^{}}2) and contains a total 1.2x10{\^{}}6 objects to a limiting magnitude of F814W=26.5. This catalog is made publicly available. The shapes of galaxies have been measured and corrected for the distortion induced by the time varying ACS Point Spread Function and for Charge Transfer Efficiency effects. Next, simulated images are used to derive the shear susceptibility factors that are necessary in order to transform shape measurements into unbiased shear estimators. Finally, for each galaxy, we derive a shape measurement error and utilize this quantity to extract the intrinsic shape noise of the galaxy sample. Interestingly, our results indicate that the intrinsic shape noise varies little with either size, magnitude or redshift. Representing a number density of 66 galaxies per arcmin{\^{}}2, the final COSMOS weak lensing catalog contains 3.9x10{\^{}}5 galaxies with accurate shape measurements. The properties of the COSMOS weak lensing catalog described throughout this paper will provide key input numbers for the preparation and design of next-generation wide field space missions.},

We employ COMBO-17 redshifts and COMBO-17 optical, GALEX far- and near-UV, and Spitzer IRAC and MIPS mid-IR photometry. This technique permits us to probe the infrared excess (IRX), the ratio of far-IR to far-UV luminosity, and the specific star formation rate (SSFR) and their coevolution over 2 orders of magnitude of stellar mass and over redshift 0.1{\textless}z{\textless}1.2. We find that the SSFR and the characteristic mass (M0) above which the SSFR drops increase with redshift (downsizing). At any given epoch, the IRX is an increasing function of mass up to M0. Above this mass the IRX falls, suggesting gas exhaustion. In a given mass bin below M0, the IRX increases with time in a fashion consistent with enrichment. We interpret these trends using a simple model with a Schmidt-Kennicutt law and extinction that tracks gas density and enrichment. We find that the average IRX and SSFR follow a galaxy age parameter $\xi$, which is determined mainly by the galaxy mass and time since formation. We conclude that blue-sequence galaxies have properties which show simple, systematic trends with mass and time such as the steady buildup of heavy elements in the interstellar media of evolving galaxies and the exhaustion of gas in galaxies that are evolving off the blue sequence. The IRX represents a tool for selecting galaxies at various stages of evolution.},

abstract = {Despite significant efforts in the recent years, the physical processes responsible for the formation of passive galaxies through cosmic time remain unclear. The shape and evolution of the Stellar Mass Function (SMF) give an insight into these mechanisms. Taking advantage from the CANDELS and the deep Hubble Frontier Fields (HFF) programs, we estimated the SMF of total, star-forming and passive galaxies from z=0.25 to z=2.75 to unprecedented depth, and focus on the latter population. The density of passive galaxies underwent a significant evolution over the last 11 Gyr. They account for 60{\%} of the total mass in the nearby Universe against {\~{}}20{\%} observed at z{\~{}}2.5. The inclusion of the HFF program allows us to detect, for the first time at z{\textgreater}1.5, the characteristic upturn in the SMF of passive galaxies at low masses, usually associated with environmental quenching. We observe two separate populations of passive galaxies evolving on different timescales: roughly half of the high mass systems were already quenched at high redshift, while low mass passive galaxies are gradually building-up over the redshift range probed. In the framework of environmental-quenching at low masses, we interpret this finding as evidence of an increasing role of the environment in the build-up of passive galaxies as a function of time. Finally, we compared our findings with a set of theoretical predictions. Despite good agreement in some redshift and mass intervals, none of the models are able to fully reproduce the observations. This calls for further investigation into the involved physical mechanisms, both theoretically and observationally, especially with the brand new JWST data.},

abstract = {Given a galaxy's stellar mass, its host halo mass has a lower limit from the cosmic baryon fraction and known baryonic physics. At z{\textgreater}4, galaxy stellar mass functions place lower limits on halo number densities that approach expected {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM halo mass functions. High-redshift galaxy stellar mass functions can thus place interesting limits on number densities of massive haloes, which are otherwise very difficult to measure. Although halo mass functions at z{\textless}8 are consistent with observed galaxy stellar masses if galaxy baryonic conversion efficiencies increase with redshift, JWST and WFIRST will more than double the redshift range over which useful constraints are available. We calculate maximum galaxy stellar masses as a function of redshift given expected halo number densities from {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM. We apply similar arguments to black holes. If their virial mass estimates are accurate, number density constraints alone suggest that the quasars SDSS J1044-0125 and SDSS J010013.02+280225.8 likely have black hole mass -- stellar mass ratios higher than the median z=0 relation, confirming the expectation from Lauer bias. Finally, we present a public code to evaluate the probability of an apparently {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM-inconsistent high-mass halo being detected given the combined effects of multiple surveys and observational errors.},

abstract = {We present deep Keck/LRIS spectroscopy and Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3 imaging in the rest-frame optical for a sample of eight galaxies at z ∼ 1.5 with high photometrically determined stellar masses. The data are combined with five Very Large Telescope/X-Shooter spectra. We find that these 13 galaxies have high velocity dispersions, with a median of $\sigma$ = 301 km s-1. This high value is consistent with their relatively high stellar masses and compact sizes. We study their stellar populations using the strength of Balmer absorption lines, which are not sensitive to dust absorption. We find a large range in Balmer absorption strength, with many galaxies showing very strong lines indicating young ages. The median H$\delta$A equivalent width, determined directly or inferred from the H10 line, is 5.4 {\AA}, indicating a luminosity-weighted age of ∼1 Gyr. Although this value may be biased toward higher values because of selection effects, high-dispersion galaxies with such young ages are extremely rare in the local universe. Interestingly, we do not find a simple correlation with rest-frame U-V color: some of the reddest galaxies have very strong Balmer absorption lines, which may indicate the importance of multiple bursts of star formation. These results demonstrate that many high-dispersion galaxies at z ∼1.5 were recently quenched. This implies that there must be a population of star-forming progenitors at z ∼ 2 with high velocity dispersions or linewidths, which are notoriously absent from CO/H$\alpha$ selected surveys. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {We describe a new program for determining photometric redshifts, dubbed EAZY. The program is optimized for cases where spectroscopic redshifts are not available, or only available for a biased subset of the galaxies. The code combines features from various existing codes: it can fit linear combinations of templates, it includes optional flux- and redshift-based priors, and its user interface is modeled on the popular HYPERZ code. A novel feature is that the default template set, as well as the default functional forms of the priors, are not based on (usually highly biased) spectroscopic samples, but on semi-analytical models. Furthermore, template mismatch is addressed by a novel rest-frame template error function. This function gives different wavelength regions different weights, and ensures that the formal redshift uncertainties are realistic. We introduce a redshift quality parameter, Q{\_}z, that provides a robust estimate of the reliability of the photometric redshift estimate. Despite the fact that EAZY is not "trained" on spectroscopic samples, the code (with default parameters) performs very well on existing public datasets. For K-selected samples in CDF-South and other deep fields we find a 1-sigma scatter in dz/(1+z) of 0.034, and we provide updated photometric redshift catalogs for the FIRES, MUSYC, and FIREWORKS surveys.},

abstract = {We present griz light curves of 146 spectroscopically confirmed Type Ia Supernovae (0.03{\textless}z{\textless}0.65) discovered during the first 1.5 years of the Pan-STARRS1 Medium Deep Survey. The Pan-STARRS1 natural photometric system is determined by a combination of on-site measurements of the instrument response function and observations of spectrophotometric standard stars. We have investigated spatial and time variations in the photometry, and we find that the systematic uncertainties in the photometric system are currently 1.2{\%} without accounting for the uncertainty in the HST Calspec definition of the AB system. We discuss our efforts to minimize the systematic uncertainties in the photometry. A Hubble diagram is constructed with a subset of 112 SNe Ia (out of the 146) that pass our light curve quality cuts. The cosmological fit to 313 SNe Ia (112 PS1 SNe Ia + 201 low-z SNe Ia), using only SNe and assuming a constant dark energy equation of state and flatness, yields w = -1.015{\^{}}{\{}+0.319{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.201{\}}(Stat)+{\{}0.164{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.122{\}}(Sys).

If we include WMAP9 CMB constraints instead of those from Planck, we find w = -1.142{\^{}}{\{}+0.076{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.087{\}}, which diminishes the discord to {\textless}2 sigma. We cannot conclude whether the tension with flat CDM is a feature of dark energy, new physics, or a combination of chance and systematic errors.

abstract = {Using data of nearby galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey we investigate whether stellar mass (M star), central velocity dispersion ($\sigma$), surface mass density ($\Sigma$), or the S{\'{e}}rsic n parameter is best correlated with a galaxy's rest-frame color. Specifically, we determine how the mean color of galaxies varies with one parameter when another is fixed. When M star is fixed we see that strong trends remain with all other parameters, whereas residual trends are weaker when $\Sigma$, n, or $\sigma$ is fixed. Overall $\sigma$ is the best indicator of a galaxy's typical color, showing the largest residual color dependence when any of the other three parameters are fixed, and M star is the poorest. Other studies have indicated that both the central black hole mass and possibly host dark matter halo properties (mass or concentration) are also better correlated with $\sigma$ than with M star, $\Sigma$, or n. Therefore, it could be the case that the strong correlation between color and $\sigma$ reflects an underlying relationship between a galaxy's star formation history and/or present star formation rate and the properties of its dark matter halo and/or the feedback from its central supermassive black hole. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {We simulate the growth of galaxies and their central supermassive black holes by implementing a suite of semi-analytic models on the output of the Millennium Run, a very large simulation of the concordance $\Lambda$ cold dark matter cosmogony. Our procedures follow the detailed assembly history of each object and are able to track the evolution of all galaxies more massive than the Small Magellanic Cloud throughout a volume comparable to that of large modern redshift surveys. In this first paper we supplement previous treatments of the growth and activity of central black holes with a new model for 'radio' feedback from those active galactic nuclei that lie at the centre of a quasi-static X-ray-emitting atmosphere in a galaxy group or cluster. We show that for energetically and observationally plausible parameters such a model can simultaneously explain: (i) the low observed mass drop-out rate in cooling flows; (ii) the exponential cut-off at the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function; and (iii) the fact that the most massive galaxies tend to be bulge-dominated systems in clusters and to contain systematically older stars than lower mass galaxies. This success occurs because static hot atmospheres form only in the most massive structures, and radio feedback (in contrast, for example, to supernova or starburst feedback) can suppress further cooling and star formation without itself requiring star formation. We discuss possible physical models that might explain the accretion rate scalings required for our phenomenological 'radio mode' model to be successful. {\textcopyright} 2005 RAS.},

abstract = {Cosmological simulations are crucial tools in studying the Universe, but they typically do not directly match real observed structures. Constrained cosmological simulations, on the other hand, are designed to match the observed distribution of galaxies. Here we present constrained simulations based on spectroscopic surveys at a redshift of z{\~{}}2.3, corresponding to an epoch of nearly 11 Gyrs ago. This allows us to 'fast-forward' the simulation to our present-day and study the evolution of observed cosmic structures self-consistently. We confirm that several previously-reported protoclusters will evolve into massive galaxy clusters by our present epoch, including the 'Hyperion' structure that we predict will collapse into a giant filamentary supercluster spanning 100 Megaparsecs. We also discover previously unknown protoclusters, with lower final masses than typically detectable by other methods, that nearly double the number of known protoclusters within this volume. Constrained simulations, applied to future high-redshift datasets, represents a unique opportunity for studying early structure formation and matching galaxy properties between high and low redshifts.},

First classified as a QSO within the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey, follow-up observations with the Gran Telescopio Canarias reveal that its large luminosity, MUV = -24.40 and log(L{\_}Lya/erg s-1) = 44.0, is due to an intense burst of star-formation, and not to an AGN or gravitational lensing. BOSS-EUVLG1 is a compact (reff = 1.2 kpc), young (4-5 Myr) starburst with a stellar mass log(M*/Msun) = 10.0 +/- 0.1 and a prodigious star formation rate of {\~{}}1000 Msun yr-1. However, it is metal- and dust-poor (12+log(O/H) = 8.13 +/- 0.19, E(B-V) = 0.07, log(LIR/LUV) {\textless} -1.2), indicating that we are witnessing the very early phase of an intense starburst that has had no time to enrich the ISM. BOSS-EUVLG1 might represent a short-lived ({\textless}100 Myrs), yet important phase of star-forming galaxies at high redshift that has been missed in previous surveys. Within a galaxy evolutionary scheme, BOSS-EUVLG1 could likely represent the very initial phases in the evolution of massive quiescent galaxies, even before the dusty star-forming phase.},

abstract = {We present a study of the [OIII]5007/[OII]3727 (O32) ratios of star-forming galaxies drawn from MUSE data spanning a redshift range 0.28{\textless}z{\textless}0.85. Recently discovered Lyman continuum (LyC) emitters have extremely high oxygen line ratios: O32{\textgreater}4. Here we aim to understand the properties and the occurrences of galaxies with such high line ratios. Combining data from several MUSE GTO programmes, we select a population of star-forming galaxies with bright emission lines, from which we draw 406 galaxies for our analysis based on their position in the z-dependent star formation rate (SFR) - stellar mass (M*) plane. Out of this sample 15 are identified as extreme oxygen emitters based on their O32 ratios (3.7{\%}) and 104 galaxies have O32{\textgreater}1 (26{\%}). Our analysis shows no significant correlation between M*, SFR, and the distance from the SFR-M* relation with O32. We find a decrease in the fraction of galaxies with O32{\textgreater}1 with increasing M*, however, this is most likely a result of the relationship between O32 and metallicity, rather than between O32 and M*. We draw a comparison sample of local analogues with {\textless}z{\textgreater}{\~{}}0.03 from SDSS, and find similar incidence rates for this sample. In order to investigate the evolution in the fraction of high O32 emitters with redshift, we bin the sample into three redshift subsamples of equal number, but find no evidence for a dependence on redshift. Furthermore, we compare the observed line ratios with those predicted by nebular models with no LyC escape and find that most of the extreme oxygen emitters can be reproduced by low metallicity models. The remaining galaxies are likely LyC emitter candidates. Finally, based on a comparison between electron temperature estimates from the [OIII4363]/[OIII]5007 ratio of the extreme oxygen emitters and nebular models, we argue that the galaxies with the most extreme O32 ratios have young light-weighted ages.},

To date, robust passive galaxy candidates have been detected up to {\$}z \backslashleqslant 5{\$}, but it is still unknown if they exist at higher redshifts, what their relative abundances are, and what causes them to stop forming stars. We present predictions from the First Light And Reionisation Epoch Simulations (FLARES), a series of zoom simulations of a range of overdensities using the EAGLE code. Passive galaxies occur naturally in the EAGLE model at high redshift, and are in good agreement with number density estimates from HST and early JWST results at {\$}3 \backslashleqslant z \backslashleqslant 5{\$}. Due to the unique FLARES approach, we extend these predictions to higher redshifts, finding passive galaxy populations up to {\$}z \backslashsim 8{\$}. Feedback from supermassive black holes is the main driver of passivity, leading to reduced gas fractions and star forming gas reservoirs. We find that passive galaxies at {\$}z \backslashgeqslant 5{\$} are not identified in the typical UVJ selection space due to their still relatively young stellar populations, and present new rest--frame selection regions. We also present NIRCam and MIRI fluxes, and find that significant numbers of passive galaxies at {\$}z \backslashgeqslant 5{\$} should be detectable in upcoming wide surveys with JWST. Finally, we present JWST colour distributions, with new selection regions in the observer--frame for identifying these early passive populations.},

abstract = {We present in this paper a detailed analysis of the effect of environment on the star formation activity of galaxies within the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We have used the H$\alpha$ emission line to derive the star formation rate (SFR) for each galaxy within a volume-limited sample of 8598 galaxies with 0.05{\textless}=z{\textless}=0.095 and M(r*){\textless}=-20.45. We find that the SFR of galaxies is strongly correlated with the local (projected) galaxy density, and thus we present here a density-SFR relation that is analogous to the density-morphology relation. The effect of density on the SFR of galaxies is seen in three ways. First, the overall distribution of SFRs is shifted to lower values in dense environments compared with the field population. Second, the effect is most noticeable for the strongly star-forming galaxies (H$\alpha$ EW{\textgreater}5 {\AA}) in the 75th percentile of the SFR distribution. Third, there is a ``break'' (or characteristic density) in the density-SFR relation at a local galaxy density of {\~{}}1 h-275 Mpc-2. To understand this break further, we have studied the SFR of galaxies as a function of clustercentric radius from 17 clusters and groups objectively selected from the SDSS EDR data. The distribution of SFRs of cluster galaxies begins to change, compared with the field population, at a clustercentric radius of 3-4 virial radii (at the {\textgreater}1 $\sigma$ statistical significance), which is consistent with the characteristic break in density that we observe in the density-SFR relation. This effect with clustercentric radius is again most noticeable for the most strongly star-forming galaxies. Our tests suggest that the density-morphology relation alone is unlikely to explain the density-SFR relation we observe. For example, we have used the (inverse) concentration index of SDSS galaxies to classify late-type galaxies and show that the distribution of the star-forming (EW H$\alpha${\textgreater}5 {\AA}) late-type galaxies is different in dense regions (within 2 virial radii) compared with similar galaxies in the field. However, at present, we are unable to make definitive statements about the independence of the density-morphology and density-SFR relation. We have tested our work against potential systematic uncertainties including stellar absorption, reddening, SDSS survey strategy, SDSS analysis pipelines, and aperture bias. Our observations are in qualitative agreement with recent simulations of hierarchical galaxy formation that predict a decrease in the SFR of galaxies within the virial radius. Our results are in agreement with recent 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey results as well as consistent with previous observations of a decrease in the SFR of galaxies in the cores of distant clusters. Taken together, these works demonstrate that the decrease in SFR of galaxies in dense environments is a universal phenomenon over a wide range in density (from 0.08 to 10 h-275 Mpc -2) and redshift (out to z{\~{}}=0.5).

abstract = {We utilize {\$}\backslashsim17000{\$} bright Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) from the novel Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Survey Validation spectroscopic sample, leveraging its deep ({\$}\backslashsim2.5{\$} hour/galaxy exposure time) spectra to characterize the contribution of recently quenched galaxies to the massive galaxy population at {\$}0.4{\textless}z{\textless}1.3{\$}. We use Prospector to infer non-parametric star formation histories and identify a significant population of post-starburst galaxies that have joined the quiescent population within the past {\$}\backslashsim1{\$} Gyr. The highest redshift subset (277 at {\$}z{\textgreater}1{\$}) of our sample of recently quenched galaxies represents the largest spectroscopic sample of post-starburst galaxies at that epoch. At {\$}0.4{\textless}z{\textless}0.8{\$}, we measure the number density of quiescent LRGs, finding that recently quenched galaxies constitute a growing fraction of the massive galaxy population with increasing lookback time. Finally, we quantify the importance of this population amongst massive ({\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}log{\}}(M{\_}\backslashstar/M{\_}\backslashodot){\textgreater}11.2{\$}) LRGs by measuring the fraction of stellar mass each galaxy formed in the Gyr before observation, {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}1 Gyr{\}}{\}}{\$}. Although galaxies with {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}1 Gyr{\}}{\}}{\textgreater}0.1{\$} are rare at {\$}z\backslashsim0.4{\$} ({\$}\backslashlesssim 0.5\backslash{\%}{\$} of the population), by {\$}z\backslashsim0.8{\$} they constitute {\$}\backslashsim3\backslash{\%}{\$} of massive galaxies. Relaxing this threshold, we find that galaxies with {\$}f{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}1 Gyr{\}}{\textgreater}5\backslash{\%}{\$} constitute {\$}\backslashsim10\backslash{\%}{\$} of the massive galaxy population at {\$}z\backslashsim0.8{\$}. We also identify a small but significant sample of galaxies at {\$}z=1.1-1.3{\$} that formed with {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}1 Gyr{\}}{\}}{\textgreater}50\backslash{\%}{\$}, implying that they may be analogues to high-redshift quiescent galaxies that formed on similar timescales. Future analysis of this unprecedented sample promises to illuminate the physical mechanisms that drive the quenching of massive galaxies after cosmic noon.},

abstract = {We have used deep images from the Hubble Space Telescope to study the evolution in the morphologies, sizes, stellar masses, colors, and internal color dispersion of galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field-North. We selected two galaxy samples at 0.7{\textless}=z{\textless}=1.4 and 1.9{\textless}=z{\textless}=3.0 from a near-infrared, flux-limited catalog with complete photometric and spectroscopic redshift information. At z{\~{}}1 the majority of galaxies with M(B){\textless}=-20.5 have rest-frame optical morphologies of early- to mid-type Hubble-sequence galaxies, and many galaxies show strong transformations between their rest-frame UV and optical morphologies. In stark contrast, galaxies at z{\~{}}2.3 all have compact and irregular rest-frame optical morphologies with little difference between their rest-frame UV and optical morphologies, and with no clearly evident Hubble-sequence candidates. The mean galaxy size increases from z{\~{}}2.3 to z{\~{}}1 by roughly 40{\%}, and the number density of galaxies larger than 3 kpc increases by a factor of {\~{}}7. The size-luminosity distribution of z{\~{}}1 galaxies is broadly consistent with that in the local universe, allowing for passive evolution. However, we argue that galaxies at z{\~{}}2.3 are not the fully formed progenitors of present-day galaxies, and they must continue to grow in both their sizes and stellar masses. We have quantified the differences in morphology by measuring the galaxies' internal UV-optical color dispersion, which constrains the amount of current star formation relative to older stellar populations. The mean and scatter in the galaxies' UV-optical total colors and internal color dispersion increase from z{\~{}}2.3 to z{\~{}}1. At z{\~{}}1 many galaxies with large internal color dispersion are spirals, with a few irregular and interacting systems. Few z{\~{}}2.3 galaxies have high internal color dispersion, and we infer that those that do are also actively merging. Using simple models, we interpret the change in the total color and internal color dispersion as evidence for the presence of older and more diverse stellar populations at z{\~{}}1 that are not generally present at z{\textgreater}{\~{}}2. The z{\~{}}2.3 galaxies do not increase their stellar diversity as rapidly as they could given basic timescale arguments and simple models. We conclude that the star formation histories of galaxies at z{\textgreater}{\~{}}2 are dominated by discrete, recurrent starbursts, which quickly homogenize the galaxies' stellar content and are possibly associated with mergers. The increase in the diversification of stellar populations by z{\~{}}1 implies that merger-induced starbursts occur less frequently than at higher redshifts, and more quiescent modes of star formation become the dominant mechanism. This transition in the mode of star formation coincides with the emergence of Hubble-sequence galaxies, which seems to occur around z{\~{}}1.4. Based on observations taken with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope, which is operated by the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy (AURA), Inc., under NASA contract NAS5-26555. These observations are associated with programs GO/DD-6337 and GO-7817.},

abstract = {In order to reproduce the high-mass end of the galaxy mass-distribution, some process must be responsible for the suppression of star-formation in the most massive of galaxies. Commonly Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are invoked to fulfil this role, but the exact means by which they do so is still the topic of much debate, with studies finding evidence for both the suppression and enhancement of star-formation in AGN hosts. Using the ZFOURGE and NMBS galaxy surveys, we investigate the host galaxy properties of a mass-limited (M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} {\$}\backslashge{\$} 10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}10.5{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}), high-luminosity (L{\$}{\_}{\{}1.4{\}}{\$} {\$}{\textgreater}{\$} 10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}24{\}}{\$} W Hz{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}) sample of radio-loud Active Galactic Nuclei to a redshift of z = 2.25. In contrast to low redshift studies, which associate radio-AGN activity with quiescent hosts, we find that the majority of z {\$}{\textgreater}{\$} 1.5 radio-AGN are hosted by star-forming galaxies. Indeed, the stellar populations of radio-AGN are found to evolve with redshift in a manner that is consistent with the non-AGN mass-similar galaxy population. Interestingly, we find the radio-AGN fraction is constant across a redshift range of 0.25 {\$}\backslashle{\$} z {\$}{\textless}{\$} 2.25, perhaps indicating that the radio-AGN duty cycle has little dependence on redshift or galaxy type. We do however see a strong relation between the radio-AGN fraction and stellar mass, with radio-AGN becoming rare below {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}10.5{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} or a halo-mass of 10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}. This halo-mass threshold is in good agreement with simulations that initiate radio-AGN feedback at this mass limit. Despite this we find that radio-AGN host star-formation rates are consistent with the non-AGN mass-similar galaxy sample, suggesting that while radio-AGN are in the right place to suppress star-formation in massive galaxies they are not necessarily responsible for doing so.},

abstract = {Quiescent galaxies having more compact morphologies than star-forming galaxies has been a consistent result in the field of galaxy evolution. What is not clear is at what point this divergence happens, i.e. when do quiescent galaxies become compact, and how big of a role does the progenitor effect play in this result? Here we aim to model the morphological and star-formation histories of high redshift (0.8 {\$}{\textless}{\$} z {\$}{\textless}{\$} 1.65) massive galaxies (log(M/M{\$}\backslashodot{\$}) {\$}{\textgreater}{\$} 10.2) with stellar population fits using HST/WFC3 G102 and G141 grism spectra plus photometry from the CLEAR (CANDELS Lyman-alpha Emission at Reionization) survey, constraining the star-formation histories for a sample of {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 400 massive galaxies using flexible star-formation histories. We develop a novel approach to classifying galaxies by their formation activity in a way that highlights the green valley population, by modeling the specific star-formation rate distributions as a function of redshift and deriving the probability that a galaxy is quiescent (PQ). Using PQ and our flexible star-formation histories we outline the evolutionary paths of our galaxies in relation to stellar mass, Sersic index, {\$}R{\_}{\{}eff{\}}{\$}, and stellar mass surface density. We find that galaxies show no appreciable stellar mass growth after entering the green valley (a net decrease of 4{\$}\backslash{\%}{\$}) while their stellar mass surface densities increase by {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 0.25 dex. Therefore galaxies are becoming compact during the green valley and this is due to increases in Sersic index and decreases in {\$}R{\_}{\{}eff{\}}{\$}.},

abstract = {We use HST images to derive effective radii and effective surface brightnesses of 15 early-type (E+S0) lens galaxies identified by the SLACS Survey. Our measurements are combined with stellar velocity dispersions from the SDSS database to investigate for the first time the distribution of lens galaxies in the fundamental plane (FP) space. Accounting for selection effects (top priority to the largest Einstein radii and thus approximately to the largest velocity dispersions, $\sigma$ ≳ 240 km s-1) and for passive evolution, the distribution of the lens galaxies inside the FP is indistinguishable from that of the parent sample of SDSS galaxies. We conclude that SLACS lenses are a fair sample of high velocity dispersion E+S0s. By comparing the central stellar velocity dispersion (CT) with the velocity dispersion that best fits the lensing models ($\sigma$SIE) we find 〈fSIE〉 ≡ 〈$\sigma$/$\sigma$SIE〉 = 1.01 ± 0.02 with 0.065 rms scatter. We infer that within the Einstein radii (typically Re/2) the SLACS lenses are very well approximated by isothermal ellipsoids, requiring a fine tuning of the stellar and dark matter distribution (the bulge-halo "conspiracy"). Interpreting the offset from the local FP in terms of evolution of the stellar mass-to-light ratio, we find d log (M/LB)/dz = -0.69 ± 0.08 (rms 0.11) consistent with the rate found for field E+S0s and with most of the stars being old (zf{\textgreater} 2) and less than ∼10{\%} of the stellar mass having formed below z = 1. We discuss our results in the context of formation mechanisms such as collisionless ("dry") mergers. {\textcopyright} 2006. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We study the origin of high-redshift, compact, quenched spheroids (red nuggets) through the dissipative shrinkage of gaseous discs into compact star-forming systems (blue nuggets). The discs, fed by cold streams, undergo violent disc instability that drives gas into the centre (along with mergers). The inflow is dissipative when its time-scale is shorter than the star formation time-scale. This implies a threshold of ˜0.28 in the cold-to-total mass ratio within the disc radius. For the typical gas fraction ˜0.5 at z ˜ 2, this threshold is traced back to a maximum spin parameter of ˜0.05, implying that ˜half the star-forming galaxies contract to blue nuggets, while the rest form extended stellar discs. Thus, the surface density of blue galaxies is expected to be bimodal about ˜109 M⊙ kpc-2, slightly increasing with mass. The blue nuggets are expected to be rare at low z when the gas fraction is low. The blue nuggets quench to red nuggets by complementary internal and external mechanisms. Internal quenching by a compact bulge, in a fast mode and especially at high z, may involve starbursts, stellar and active galactic nucleus feedback, or Q-quenching. Quenching due to hot-medium haloes above 1012 M⊙ provides maintenance and a slower mode at low redshift. These predictions are confirmed in simulations and are consistent with observations at z = 0-3.},

We demonstrate that the extinction-corrected H-alpha luminosity is a reliable SFR tracer even in highly obscured star-forming galaxies. We find that variations in dust reddening dominate the systematic uncertainty in SFRs derived from the observed H-beta, [O II], and U-band luminosities, producing a factor of {\~{}}1.7, {\~{}}2.5, and {\~{}}2.1 scatter in the mean transformations, respectively. We show that [O II] depends weakly on variations in oxygen abundance over a wide range in metallicity, 12+log(O/H)=8.15-8.7 dex (Z/Z{\_}sun=0.28-1.0), and that in this metallicity interval galaxies occupy a narrow range in ionization parameter (-3.8{\textless}log U{\textless}-2.9 dex). We show that the scatter in [O III] 5007 as a SFR indicator is a factor of 3-4 due to its sensitivity to metal abundance and ionization. We develop empirical SFR calibrations for H-beta and [O II] parameterized in terms of the B-band luminosity, which remove the systematic effects of reddening and metallicity, and reduce the SFR scatter to +/-40{\%} and +/-90{\%}, respectively, although individual galaxies may deviate substantially from the median relations. Finally, we compare the z{\~{}}0 relations between blue luminosity and reddening, ionization, and [O II]/H-alpha ratio against measurements at z{\~{}}1 and find broad agreement. (Abridged.)},

abstract = {We look at the morphology of fast and slow rotator early-type galaxies. Edge-on fast rotators are lenticular galaxies. They appear like spiral galaxies with the gas and dust removed, and in some cases are flat ellipticals with disky isophotes. Fast rotators are often barred and span the same full range of bulge fractions as spiral galaxies. The slow rotators are rounder and are generally consistent with being genuine, namely spheroidal-like, elliptical galaxies. We propose a revision to the tuning-fork diagram by Hubble as it gives a misleading description of ETGs. We study for the first time the kinematic morphology-density T-Sigma relation using fast and slow rotators to replace lenticulars and ellipticals. We find that our relation is cleaner than using classic morphology. Slow rotators are nearly absent at the lowest density environments [f(SR){\textless}2{\%}] and generally constitute a small fraction [f(SR){\~{}}4{\%}] of the total galaxy population in the environments explored by our survey, with the exception of the densest core of the Virgo cluster [f(SR){\~{}}20{\%}]. We find a clean log-linear relation between the fraction f(Sp) of spiral galaxies and the local galaxy surface density. The existence of a smooth kinematic T-Sigma relation in the field excludes processes related to the cluster environment as main contributors to the apparent conversion of spirals into fast-rotators in low-density environments. It shows that the segregation is driven by local effects at the small-group scale. Only at the largest densities in the Virgo core does the f(Sp) relation break down and steepens sharply, while the fraction of slow-rotators starts to significantly increase. This suggests that a different mechanism is at work there. (Abridged)},

abstract = {We combine Herschel PACS and SPIRE maps of the full 2 deg{\^{}}2 COSMOS field with existing multi-wavelength data to obtain template and model-independent optical-to-far-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 4,218 Herschel-selected sources with log(L{\_}IR/L{\_}sun) = 9.4-13.6 and z = 0.02-3.54. Median SEDs are created by binning the optical to far-infrared (FIR) bands available in COSMOS as a function of infrared luminosity. Herschel probes rest-frame wavelengths where the bulk of the infrared radiation is emitted, allowing us to more accurately determine fundamental dust properties of our sample of infrared luminous galaxies. We find that the SED peak wavelength (lambda{\_}peak) decreases and the dust mass (M{\_}dust) increases with increasing total infrared luminosity (L{\_}IR). In the lowest infrared luminosity galaxies (log(L{\_}IR/L{\_}sun) = 10.0-11.5), we see evidence of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) features (lambda=7-9 um), while in the highest infrared luminosity galaxies (L{\_}IR {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}12 L{\_}sun) we see an increasing contribution of hot dust and/or power-law emission, consistent with the presence of heating from an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We study the relationship between stellar mass and star formation rate of our sample of infrared luminous galaxies and find no evidence that Herschel-selected galaxies follow the SFR/M{\_}* "main sequence" as previously determined from studies of optically selected, star-forming galaxies. Finally, we compare the mid-infrared (MIR) to FIR properties of our infrared luminous galaxies using the previously defined diagnostic, IR8 = L{\_}IR / L{\_}8, and find that galaxies with L{\_}IR {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}11.3 L{\_}sun tend to systematically lie above ({\~{}}3-5) the IR8 "infrared main sequence", suggesting either suppressed PAH emission or an increasing contribution from AGN heating.},

abstract = {Using the $\backslash$textsc{\{}Horizon-AGN{\}} hydrodynamical simulation and self-organising maps (SOMs), we show how to compress the complex data structure of a cosmological simulation into a 2-d grid which is much easier to analyse. We first verify the tight correlation between the observed 0.3{\$}\backslash!-\backslash!5\backslashmu{\$}m broad-band colours of $\backslash$textsc{\{}Horizon-AGN{\}} galaxies and their high-resolution spectra. The correlation is found to extend to physical properties such as redshift, stellar mass, and star formation rate (SFR). This direct mapping from colour to physical parameter space is shown to work also after including photometric uncertainties that mimic the COSMOS survey. We then label the SOM grid with a simulated calibration sample and estimate redshift and SFR for COSMOS-like galaxies up to {\$}z\backslashsim3{\$}. In comparison to state-of-the-art techniques based on synthetic templates, our method is comparable in performance but less biased at estimating redshifts, and significantly better at predicting SFRs. In particular our ``data-driven'' approach, in contrast to model libraries, intrinsically allows for the complexity of galaxy formation and can handle sample biases. We advocate that obtaining the calibration for this method should be one of the goals of next-generation galaxy surveys.},

With 80 objects observed and 63 detected in at least one rest-frame optical nebular emission line, mainly H$\alpha$, SINS represents the largest survey of spatially resolved gas kinematics, morphologies, and physical properties of star-forming galaxies at z 1-3. We describe the selection of the targets, the observations, and the data reduction. We then focus on the "SINS H$\alpha$ sample," consisting of 62 rest-UV/optically selected sources at 1.3 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.6 for which we targeted primarily the H$\alpha$ and [N II] emission lines. Only ≈ 30{\%} of this sample had previous near-IR spectroscopic observations. The galaxies were drawn from various imaging surveys with different photometric criteria; as a whole, the SINS H$\alpha$ sample covers a reasonable representation of massive M* ≳ 1010 M {\textperiodcentered}star-forming galaxies at z 1.5-2.5, with some bias toward bluer systems compared to pure K-selected samples due to the requirement of secure optical redshift. The sample spans 2 orders of magnitude in stellar mass and in absolute and specific star formation rates, with median values ≈ 3 × 1010 M {\textperiodcentered}, ≈ 70 M{\textperiodcentered} yr-1, and 3 Gyr-1. The ionized gas distribution and kinematics are spatially resolved on scales ranging from 1.5 kpc for adaptive optics assisted observations to typically 4-5 kpc for seeing-limited data. The H$\alpha$ morphologies tend to be irregular and/or clumpy. About one-third of the SINS H$\alpha$ sample galaxies are rotation-dominated yet turbulent disks, another one-third comprises compact and velocity dispersion-dominated objects, and the remaining galaxies are clear interacting/merging systems; the fraction of rotation-dominated systems increases among the more massive part of the sample. The H$\alpha$ luminosities and equivalent widths suggest on average roughly twice higher dust attenuation toward the H II regions relative to the bulk of the stars, and comparable current and past-averaged star formation rates. {\textcopyright} 2009.

abstract = {We utilise a series of high-resolution cosmological zoom simulations of galaxy formation to investigate the relationship between the ultraviolet (UV) slope, beta, and the ratio of the infrared luminosity to UV luminosity (IRX) in the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies. We employ dust radiative transfer calculations in which the SEDs of the stars in galaxies propagate through the dusty interstellar medium. Our main goals are to understand the origin of, and scatter in the IRX-beta relation; to assess the efficacy of simplified stellar population synthesis screen models in capturing the essential physics in the IRX-beta relation; and to understand systematic deviations from the canonical local IRX-beta relations in particular populations of high-redshift galaxies. Our main results follow. Galaxies that have young stellar populations with relatively cospatial UV and IR emitting regions and a Milky Way-like extinction curve fall on or near the standard Meurer relation. This behaviour is well captured by simplified screen models. Scatter in the IRX-beta relation is dominated by three major effects: (i) older stellar populations drive galaxies below the relations defined for local starbursts due to a reddening of their intrinsic UV SEDs; (ii) complex geometries in high-z heavily star forming galaxies drive galaxies toward blue UV slopes owing to optically thin UV sightlines; (iii) shallow extinction curves drive galaxies downward in the IRX-beta plane due to lowered NUV/FUV extinction ratios. We use these features of the UV slopes of galaxies to derive a fitting relation that reasonably collapses the scatter back toward the canonical local relation. Finally, we use these results to develop an understanding for the location of two particularly enigmatic populations of galaxies in the IRX-beta plane: z{\~{}}2-4 dusty star forming galaxies, and z{\textgreater}5 star forming galaxies.},

The most spectacular examples are galaxies with extended tails of optically-bright stripped material known as "jellyfish". We use the first large homogeneous compilation of jellyfish galaxies in clusters from the WINGS and OmegaWINGS surveys, and follow-up MUSE observations from the GASP MUSE programme to investigate the orbital histories of jellyfish galaxies in clusters and reconstruct their stripping history through position vs. velocity phase- space diagrams. We construct analytic models to define the regions in phase-space where ram-pressure stripping is at play. We then study the distribution of cluster galaxies in phase-space and find that jellyfish galaxies have on average higher peculiar velocities (and higher cluster velocity dispersion) than the overall population of cluster galaxies at all clustercentric radii, which is indicative of recent infall into the cluster and radial orbits. In particular, the jellyfish galaxies with the longest gas tails reside very near the cluster cores (in projection) and are moving at very high speeds, which coincides with the conditions of the most intense ram-pressure. We conclude that many of the jellyfish galaxies seen in clusters likely formed via fast ({\~{}}1- 2 Gyr), incremental, outside-in ram-pressure stripping during first infall into the cluster in highly radial orbits.},

We find that different galaxy types populate different regions of both size-mass and {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}1{\$}-mass space. The nine star-forming groups lie along the integrated star-forming {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}1{\$}-mass relation. However, these star-forming groups form steep parallel relations in the size-mass plane, with slopes similar to the quiescent size-mass relation. These steep slopes can be explained as a transformation of the star-forming {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}1{\$}-mass relation and its scatter. We identify three types of transitional galaxies. Green valley and post-starburst galaxies are similarly compact at {\$}z{\textgreater}1.5{\$}; however, their distinct color gradients indicate that the two populations represent different pathways to quenching. Post-starburst galaxies have flat color gradients and compact structures, consistent with a fast quenching pathway which requires structural change and operates primarily at high redshift. Green valley galaxies have negative color gradients, and are both larger and more numerous towards lower redshift. These galaxies are consistent with slow quenching without significant structural change. We find that dusty star-forming galaxies at {\$}z\backslashgtrsim2{\$} are very compact, and may represent the "burst" before post-starburst galaxies; at {\$}z\backslashlesssim2{\$}, dusty star-forming galaxies are extended and have shallow color gradients consistent with slow quenching.

In this work, Paper I, we present the evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function using new mass measurements of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}10{\$}{\^{}}5{\$} galaxies in the 3D-HST and COSMOS-2015 surveys. We employ a new methodology to infer the mass function from the observed stellar masses: instead of fitting independent mass functions in a series of fixed redshift intervals, we construct a continuity model that directly fits for the redshift evolution of the mass function. This approach ensures a smooth picture of galaxy assembly and makes use of the full, non-Gaussian uncertainty contours in our stellar mass inferences. The resulting mass function has higher number densities at a fixed stellar mass than almost any other measurement in the literature, largely owing to the older stellar ages inferred by $\backslash$texttt{\{}Prospector{\}}. The stellar mass density is {\$}\backslashsim{\$}50{\%} higher than previous measurements, with the offset peaking at {\$}z\backslashsim1{\$}.

abstract = {We use a newly assembled large sample of 3,545 star-forming galaxies with secure spectroscopic, grism, and photometric redshifts at z=1.5-2.5 to constrain the relationship between UV slope (beta) and dust attenuation (L(IR)/L(UV)=IRX). Our sample benefits from the combination of deep Hubble WFC3/UVIS photometry from the Hubble Deep UV (HDUV) Legacy survey and existing photometric data compiled in the 3D-HST survey, and extends the range of UV luminosity and beta probed in previous UV-selected samples. IRX is measured using stacks of deep Herschel/PACS 100 and 160 micron data, and the results are compared with predictions of the IRX-beta relation for different assumptions of the stellar population model and obscuration curve. We find that z=1.5-2.5 galaxies have an IRX-beta relation that is consistent with the predictions for an SMC extinction curve if we invoke sub-solar metallicity models that are currently favored for high-redshift galaxies, while the commonly assumed starburst attenuation curve over-predicts the IRX at a given beta by a factor of {\~{}}3. The IRX of high-mass (M*{\textgreater}10{\^{}}9.75 Msun) galaxies is a factor of {\textgreater}4 larger than that of low-mass galaxies, lending support for the use of stellar mass as a proxy for attenuation. The commonly observed trend of fainter galaxies having bluer beta may simply reflect bluer intrinsic UV slopes for such galaxies, rather than lower obscurations. The IRX-beta for young/low-mass galaxies implies a dust curve that is steeper than the SMC, suggesting a lower attenuation at a given beta relative to older/more massive galaxies. The lower attenuations and higher ionizing photon output implied by low metallicity stellar population models point to Lyman continuum production efficiencies, xi{\_}ion, that may be elevated by a factor of {\~{}}2 relative to the canonical value for L* galaxies, aiding in their ability to keep the universe ionized at z{\~{}}2.

abstract = {Fundamental differences in the radio properties of red quasars (QSOs), as compared to blue QSOs, have been recently discovered, positioning them as a potential key population in the evolution of galaxies and black holes across cosmic time. To elucidate their nature, we exploited a rich compilation of photometry and spectroscopic data to model their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) from the UV to the FIR and characterise their emission-line properties. Following a systematic comparison approach, we infer the AGN accretion, obscuration, and host galaxy properties in a sample of {\~{}}1800 QSOs at 0.2{\textless}z{\textless}2.5, classified into red and control QSOs and matched in redshift and luminosity. We find no differences in the average SEDs of red and control QSOs, other than the reddening of the accretion disk expected by the selection. Moreover, no clear link can be recognised between the QSO reddening and the interstellar medium or the star formation properties of their host galaxies. We find that the torus properties in red and control QSOs are strikingly similar, suggesting that the reddening is not related to the torus and orientation effects. Interestingly, we detect a significant excess of infrared emission at rest-frame 2-5 um, which shows a direct correlation with optical reddening. To explain its origin, we investigated the presence of outflow signatures in the QSO spectra, discovering a higher incidence of broad [OIII] wings and high CIV velocity shifts ({\textgreater}1000 km/s) in red QSOs. We find that red QSOs that exhibit evidence for high-velocity winds present a stronger signature of the infrared excess, suggesting a causal connection between reddening and the presence of hot dust in QSO winds. We propose that dusty winds at nuclear scales are potentially the physical ingredient responsible for the colours in red QSOs, as well as a key parameter for the regulation of accretion material in the nucleus.},

We parametrize the environment where our targets reside by using local and global density indicators based on previous samples of spectroscopic and narrow-band cluster members. We find that star-forming galaxies embedded in the Spiderweb protocluster display SFRs compatible with those of the main sequence and morphologies comparable to those of late-type galaxies at {\$}z=2.2{\$} in the field. We also report a mild gas-phase metallicity enhancement ({\$}0.6\backslashpm0.3{\$} dex) at intermediate stellar masses. Furthermore, we identify two UVJ-selected quiescent galaxies with residual H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-based star formation and find signs of extreme dust obscuration in a small sample of SMGs based on their FIR and H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emission. Interestingly, the spatial distribution of these objects differs from the rest of HAEs, avoiding the protocluster core. Finally, we explore the gas fraction-gas metallicity diagram for 7 galaxies with molecular gas masses measured by ATCA using CO(1-0). In the context of the gas-regulator model, our objects are consistent with relatively low mass-loading factors, suggesting lower outflow activity than field samples at the cosmic noon and thus, hinting at the onset of environmental effects in this massive protocluster.},

In present models, such galaxies appear rather late as the culmination of a hierarchical merging process, in which larger galaxies are assembled through mergers of smaller precursor galaxies. But observations have not yet established how, or even when, the massive spheroidals formed, nor if their seemingly sudden appearance when the Universe was about half its present age (at redshift z $\backslash$approx 1) results from a real evolutionary effect (such as a peak of mergers) or from the observational difficulty of identifying them at earlier epochs. Here we report the spectroscopic and morphological identification of four old, fully assembled, massive ({\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} solar masses) spheroidal galaxies at 1.6{\textless}z{\textless}1.9, the most distant such objects currently known. The existence of such systems when the Universe was only one-quarter of its present age, shows that the build-up of massive early-type galaxies was much faster in the early Universe than has been expected from theoretical simulations.},

In the first few months of operations, imaging from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) have been used to identify tens of candidates of galaxies at redshift (z) greater than 10, less than 450 million years after the Big Bang. However, none of these candidates has yet been confirmed spectroscopically, leaving open the possibility that they are actually low-redshift interlopers. Here we present spectroscopic confirmation and analysis of four galaxies unambiguously detected at redshift 10.3{\textless}z{\textless}13.2, previously selected from NIRCam imaging. The spectra reveal that these primeval galaxies are extremely metal poor, have masses between 10{\^{}}7 and a few times 10{\^{}}8 solar masses, and young ages. The damping wings that shape the continuum close to the Lyman edge are consistent with a fully neutral intergalactic medium at this epoch. These findings demonstrate the rapid emergence of the first generations of galaxies at cosmic dawn.},

Keck Observatory. In conjunction with a similar dataset we obtained in the range 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.5 with the LRIS spectrograph, we analyze the kinematic and structural properties for 80 quiescent galaxies, the largest homogeneously-selected sample to date spanning 3 Gyr of early cosmic history. Analysis of our Keck spectra together with measurements derived from associated HST images reveals increasingly larger stellar velocity dispersions and smaller sizes to redshifts beyond z{\~{}}2. By classifying our sample according to Sersic indices, we find that among disk-like systems the flatter ones show a higher dynamical to stellar mass ratio compared to their rounder counterparts which we interpret as evidence for a significant contribution of rotational motion. For this subset of disk-like systems, we estimate that V/sigma, the ratio of the circular velocity to the intrinsic velocity dispersion, is a factor of two larger than for present-day disky quiescent galaxies. We use the velocity dispersion measurements also to explore the redshift evolution of the dynamical to stellar mass ratio, and to measure for the first time the physical size growth rate of individual systems over two distinct redshift ranges, finding a faster evolution at earlier times. We discuss the physical origin of this time-dependent growth in size in the context of the associated reduction of the systematic rotation.},

Satellites for both star-forming and quiescent central galaxies have higher quiescent fractions compared to field galaxies matched in stellar mass at all redshifts. We also observe "galactic conformity": satellites around quiescent centrals are more likely to be quenched compared to the satellites around star-forming centrals. In our sample, this conformity signal is significant at {\$}\backslashgtrsim3\backslashsigma{\$} for {\$}0.6{\textless}z{\textless}1.6{\$}, whereas it is only weakly significant at {\$}0.3{\textless}z{\textless}0.6{\$} and {\$}1.6{\textless}z{\textless}2.5{\$}. Therefore, conformity (and therefore satellite quenching) has been present for a significant fraction of the age of the universe. The satellite quenching efficiency increases with increasing stellar mass of the central, but does not appear to depend on the stellar mass of the satellite to the mass limit of our sample. When we compare the satellite quenching efficiency of star-forming centrals with stellar masses 0.2 dex higher than quiescent centrals (which should account for any difference in halo mass), the conformity signal decreases, but remains statistically significant at {\$}0.6{\textless}z{\textless}0.9{\$}. This is evidence that satellite quenching is connected to the star-formation properties of the central as well as to the mass of the halo. We discuss physical effects that may contribute to galactic conformity, and emphasize that they must allow for continued star-formation in the central galaxy even as the satellites are quenched.},

Here we present first results on the galaxy color bimodality at low redshift. Accounting for the attenuation of stellar light by dust, we compare the simulated (g-r) colors of 10{\^{}}9 {\textless} M*/Msun {\textless} 10{\^{}}12.5 galaxies to the observed distribution from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find a striking improvement with respect to the original Illustris simulation, as well as excellent quantitative agreement in comparison to the observations, with a sharp transition in median color from blue to red at a characteristic M* {\~{}} 10{\^{}}10.5 Msun. Investigating the build-up of the color-mass plane and the formation of the red sequence, we demonstrate that the primary driver of galaxy color transition in the TNG model is supermassive blackhole feedback in its low-accretion state. Across the entire population we measure a median color transition timescale dt{\_}green of {\~{}}1.6 Gyr, a value which drops for increasingly massive galaxies. We find signatures of the physical process of quenching: at fixed stellar mass, redder galaxies have lower SFRs, gas fractions, and gas metallicities; their stellar populations are also older and their large-scale interstellar magnetic fields weaker than in bluer galaxies. Finally, we measure the amount of stellar mass growth on the red sequence. Galaxies with M* {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}11 Msun which redden at z{\textless}1 accumulate on average {\~{}}25{\%} of their final z=0 mass post-reddening; at the same time, {\~{}}18{\%} of such massive galaxies acquire half or more of their final stellar mass while on the red sequence.},

For this purpose we wrote the code CIGALE (Code Investigating GALaxy Emission) that uses model spectra composed of the Maraston (or PEGASE) stellar population models, synthetic attenuation functions based on a modified Calzetti law, spectral line templates, the Dale {\&} Helou dust emission models, and optional spectral templates of obscured AGN. Depending on the input redshifts, filter fluxes are computed for the model set and compared to the galaxy photometry by carrying out a Bayesian-like analysis. CIGALE was tested by analysing 39 nearby galaxies selected from SINGS. The reliability of the different model parameters was evaluated by studying the resulting expectation values and their standard deviations in relation to the input model grid. Moreover, the influence of the filter set and the quality of photometric data on the code results was estimated. For up to 17 filters between 0.15 and 160 mum, we find robust results for the mass, star formation rate, effective age of the stellar population at 4000 A, bolometric luminosity, luminosity absorbed by dust, and attenuation in the far-UV. A study of the mutual relations between the reliable properties confirms the dependence of star formation activity on morphology in the local Universe and indicates a significant drop in this activity at about 10{\^{}}11 M{\_}sol towards higher total stellar masses. The dustiest sample galaxies are present in the same mass range. [abridged]},

abstract = {We present dynamical and structural scaling relations of quiescent galaxies at z = 2, including the dynamical-mass-size relation and the first constraints on the fundamental plane (FP). The backbone of the analysis is a new, very deep Very Large Telescope/X-shooter spectrum of a massive, compact, quiescent galaxy at z = 2.0389. We detect the continuum between 3700 and 22,000 {\AA} and several strong absorption features (Balmer series, Ca H+K, G band) from which we derive a stellar velocity dispersion of 318 ± 53kms-1. We perform detailed modeling of the continuum emission and line indices and derive strong simultaneous constraints on the age, metallicity, and stellar mass. The galaxy is a dusty (AV = 0.77+0.36-0.32) solar metallicity (log(Z/Z) = 0.02+0.20-0.41) post-starburst galaxy, with a mean-luminosity-weighted log(age/yr) of 8.9 ± 0.1. The galaxy formed the majority of its stars at z {\textgreater} 3 and currently has little or no ongoing star formation. We compile a sample of three other z 2 quiescent galaxies with measured velocity dispersions, two of which are also post-starburst like. Their dynamical-mass-size relation is offset significantly less than the stellar-mass-size relation from the local early-type relations, which we attribute to a lower central dark matter fraction. Recent cosmological merger simulations agree qualitatively with the data, but cannot fully account for the evolution in the dark matter fraction. The z 2 FP requires additional evolution beyond passive stellar aging to be in agreement with the local FP. The structural evolution predicted by the cosmological simulations is insufficient, suggesting that additional, possibly non-homologous, structural evolution is needed. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {I present a comparison between published dynamical (ATLAS3D) and spectroscopic (Conroy {\&} van Dokkum) constraints on the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in early-type galaxies, using the 34 galaxies in common between the two works. Both studies infer an average IMF mass factor $\alpha$ (the stellar mass relative to a Kroupa-IMF population of similar age and metallicity) greater than unity, i.e. both methods favour an IMF which is heavier than that of the Milky Way, on average over the sample. However, on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis, there is no correlation between $\alpha$ inferred from the two approaches. I investigate how the two estimates of $\alpha$ are correlated systematically with the galaxy velocity dispersion, $\sigma$, and with the Mg/Fe abundance ratio. The spectroscopic method, based on the strengths of metal absorption lines, yields a correlation only with metal abundance ratios: at fixed Mg/Fe, there is no residual correlation with $\sigma$. The dynamical method, applied to exactly the same galaxy sample, yields the opposite result: the IMF variation correlates only with dynamics, with no residual correlation with Mg/Fe after controlling for $\sigma$. Hence, although bothmethods indicate a heavy IMF on average in ellipticals, they lead to incompatible results for the systematic trends, when applied to the same set of galaxies. The sense of the disagreement could suggest that one (or both) of the methods has not accounted fully for the main confounding factors, i.e. element abundance ratios or dark matter contributions. Alternatively, the poor agreement might indicate additional variation in the detailed shape of the IMF, beyond what can currently be inferred from the spectroscopic features. {\textcopyright} 2014 The Authors.

abstract = {The UVJ color-color diagram is a popular and efficient method to distinguish between quiescent and star-forming galaxies through their rest-frame {\$}U-V{\$} vs. {\$}V-J{\$} colors. Here we explore the information content of this color-color space using the Bayesian inference machine Prospector. We fit the same physical model to two datasets: (i) UVJ fluxes alone, and (ii) full UV-mid IR (MIR) broadband SEDs from the 3D-HST survey. Notably this model uses both nonparametric SFHs and a flexible dust attenuation curve, both of which have the potential to `break' the typical correlations observed in UVJ color-color space. Instead, these fits confirm observed trends between UVJ colors and observed galaxy properties, including specific star formation rate (sSFR), dust attenuation, stellar age, and stellar metallicity. They also demonstrate that UVJ colors do not, on their own, constrain stellar age or metallicity; the observed trends in the UVJ diagram are instead driven by galaxy scaling relationships and thus will evolve with cosmological time. We also show that UVJ colors 'saturate' below {\$}\backslashlog(\backslashmathrm{\{}sSFR/yr{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}})\backslashlesssim -10.5{\$}, i.e. changing sSFR no longer produces substantial changes in UVJ colors. We show that far-UV and/or MIR fluxes continue to correlate with sSFR down to low sSFRs and can be used in color-color diagrams to efficiently target galaxies with much lower levels of ongoing star formation. We provide selection criteria in these new color-color spaces as a function of desired sample sSFR.},

We find that without this inclusion, stellar masses and star formation rates (SFRs) in AGN host galaxies can be overestimated, on average, by factors of up to {\$}\backslashsim 5{\$} and {\$}\backslashsim 10{\$}, respectively. The average SFR of galaxies with X-ray luminous AGN is higher by a factor of {\$}\backslashsim 3{\$} to {\$}10{\$} compared to galaxies without X-ray luminous AGN at fixed stellar mass and redshift, suggesting that high SFRs and high AGN X-ray luminosities may be fueled by common mechanisms.

abstract = {We examine the growth and evolution of quenched galaxies in the Mufasa cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include an evolving halo mass-based quenching prescription, with galaxy colours computed accounting for line-of-sight extinction to individual star particles. Mufasa reproduces the observed present-day red sequence reasonably well, including its slope, amplitude, and scatter. In Mufasa, the red sequence slope is driven entirely by the steep stellar mass-stellar metallicity relation, which independently agrees with observations. High-mass star-forming galaxies blend smoothly onto the red sequence, indicating the lack of a well-defined green valley at M*{\textgreater}10{\^{}}10.5 Mo. The most massive galaxies quench the earliest and then grow very little in mass via dry merging; they attain their high masses at earlier epochs when cold inflows more effectively penetrate hot halos. To higher redshifts, the red sequence becomes increasingly contaminated with massive dusty star-forming galaxies; UVJ selection subtly but effectively separates these populations. We then examine the evolution of the mass functions of central and satellite galaxies split into passive and star-forming via UVJ. Massive quenched systems show good agreement with observations out to z{\~{}}2, despite not including a rapid early quenching mode associated with mergers. However, low-mass quenched galaxies are far too numerous at z{\textless}1 in Mufasa, indicating that Mufasa strongly over-quenches satellites. A challenge for hydrodynamic simulations is to devise a quenching model that produces enough early massive quenched galaxies and keeps them quenched to z=0, while not being so strong as to over-quench satellites; Mufasa's current scheme fails at the latter.},

abstract = {Nebular emission lines are critical to measure physical properties in the ionized gas (e.g., metallicity, the SFR, or dust attenuation). They also account for a significant fraction of broadband fluxes, in particular at the highest redshifts, and therefore can strongly affect the determination of other physical properties, such as the stellar mass, which are crucial in shaping our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. We investigate a sample of 51 LBGs at 3.0{\textless}z{\textless}3.8 with detected [OIII] line emissions and estimated the physical properties of these galaxies to examine the impact of including nebular emission data in the SED fitting. We used CIGALE to fit the rest-frame UV-to-NIR SEDs of these galaxies and their emission line data simultaneously. We ran CIGALE with and without the nebular model or the emission line data, and compare the results to show the importance of including the nebular emission line data in the SED fitting. We find that without the nebular model, the fitting overestimates the stellar mass due to the strong [OIII] lines that are redshifted to the Ks-band, consistent with previous results. The emission line data are necessary to constrain the nebular model in the SED fitting. Examining the Ks-band excess, which is mostly used to estimate the emissions of the [OIII]+Hb lines when there is no spectral data, we find that the estimation and observation are statistically consistent. However, the difference can reach up to more than 1 dex in some catastrophic cases, which shows the importance of obtaining spectroscopic measurements for these lines. We also estimate the equivalent width of the Hb absorption and find it negligible compared to the Hb emission. We conclude that line emission is important to constrain the nebular models and to obtain reliable estimates of the physical properties of galaxies. These data should be taken into account in the SED fitting.},

We also develop a simple model to disentangle intrinsic color variations and reddening by dust, and expand the method to incorporate U-band light curves and to more easily accommodate prior constraints on any of the model parameters. We apply this method to 133 nearby SN Ia, including 95 objects in the Hubble flow (cz {\textgreater}= 2500 km/s), which give an intrinsic dispersion of less than 7{\%} in distance. The Hubble flow sample, which is of critical importance to all cosmological uses of SN Ia, is the largest ever presented with homogeneous distances. We find the Hubble flow supernovae with Hd {\textgreater}= 7400 km/s yield an expansion rate that is 6.5 +/- 1.8{\%} lower than the rate determined from supernovae within that distance, and this can have a large effect on measurements of the dark energy equation of state with SN Ia. Peculiar velocities of SN Ia host galaxies in the rest frame of the Local Group are consistent with the dipole measured in the Cosmic Microwave Background. Direct fits of SN Ia that are significantly reddened by dust in their host galaxies suggest their mean extinction law may be described by R{\_}V {\~{}}= 2.7, but optical colors alone provide weak constraints on R{\_}V.},

This sample complements the MOSDEF and KBSS surveys, extending to lower stellar masses ({\$}10{\^{}}7-10{\^{}}8 M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}) and larger specific star formation rates ({\$}5-300{\$} Gyr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}), providing a window on galaxies directly following a burst or recent upturn in star formation. The hydrogen ionizing production efficiency is found to increase with the [OIII] EW, in a manner similar to that found in local galaxies by Chevallard et al. (2018). We describe how this relationship helps explain the anomalous success rate in identifying Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emission in {\$}z\backslashgtrsim7{\$} galaxies with strong [O III]+H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} emission. We probe the impact of the intense radiation field on the ISM using O32 and Ne3O2, two ionization-sensitive indices. Both are found to scale with the [OIII] EW, revealing extreme ionization conditions not commonly seen in older and more massive galaxies. In the most intense line emitters, the indices have very large average values (O32 {\$}=9.1{\$}, Ne3O2 {\$}=0.5{\$}) that have been shown to be linked to ionizing photon escape. We discuss implications for the nature of galaxies most likely to have O32 values associated with significant LyC escape. Finally we consider the optimal strategy for JWST spectroscopic investigations of galaxies at {\$}z\backslashgtrsim10{\$} where the strongest rest-optical lines are no longer visible with NIRSpec.},

abstract = {We reassess the galaxy size-mass relation out to z{\~{}}3 using a new definition of size and a sample of {\textgreater}29,000 galaxies from the 3D-HST, CANDELS, and COSMOS-DASH surveys. Instead of the half-light radius r{\_}50 we use r{\_}80, the radius containing 80{\%} of the stellar light. We find that the r{\_}80 -- M{\_}star relation has the form of a broken power law, with a clear change of slope at a pivot mass M{\_}p. Below the pivot mass the relation is shallow (r{\_}80 $\backslash$propto M{\_}star{\^{}}0.15) and above it it is steep (r{\_}80$\backslash$propto M{\_}star{\^{}}0.6). The pivot mass increases with redshift, from log(M{\_}p/M{\_}sun){\~{}} 10.2 at z=0.4 to log(M{\_}p/M{\_}sun){\~{}} 10.9 at z=1.7-3. We compare these r{\_}80-M{\_}star relations to the M{\_}halo-M{\_}star relations derived from galaxy-galaxy lensing, clustering analyses, and abundance matching techniques. Remarkably, the pivot stellar masses of both relations are consistent with each other at all redshifts, and the slopes are very similar both above and below the pivot when assuming M{\_}halo $\backslash$propto r{\_}80{\^{}}3. The implied scaling factor to relate galaxy size to halo size is r{\_}80 / R{\_}vir = 0.047, independent of stellar mass and redshift.From redshift 0 to 1.5, the pivot mass also coincides with the mass where the fraction of star-forming galaxies is 50{\%}, suggesting that the pivot mass reflects a transition from dissipational to dissipationless galaxy growth. Finally, our results imply that the scatter in the stellar-to-halo mass ratio is relatively small for massive halos ({\~{}}0.2 dex for M{\_}halo{\textgreater}10{\^{}}12.5 M{\_}sun).},

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that galaxies at cosmic noon are redder in the center and bluer in the outskirts, mirroring results in the local universe. These color gradients could be caused by either gradients in the stellar age or dust opacity; however, distinguishing between these two causes is impossible with rest-frame optical photometry alone. Here we investigate the underlying causes of the gradients from spatially-resolved rest-frame {\$}U-V{\$} vs. {\$}V-J{\$} color-color diagrams, measured from early observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. We use {\$}1\backslash, \backslashmu m - 4\backslash, \backslashmu m{\$} NIRCam photometry from the CEERS survey of a sample of 54 galaxies with {\$}M{\_}* / M{\_}\backslashodot{\textgreater}10{\$} at redshifts {\$}1.7{\textless}z{\textless}2.3{\$} selected from the 3D-HST catalog.

We construct resolved rest-frame {\$}U-V{\$} and {\$}V-J{\$} color profiles. The majority of star-forming galaxies have negative gradients (i.e. redder in the center, bluer in the outskirts) in both {\$}U-V{\$} and {\$}V-J{\$} colors consistent with radially decreasing dust attenuation. A smaller population (roughly 15$\backslash${\%}) of star-forming galaxies have positive {\$}U-V{\$} but negative {\$}V-J{\$} gradients implying centrally concentrated star-formation. For quiescent galaxies we find a diversity of UVJ color profiles, with roughly one-third showing star-formation in their center.

Redshifts for two of the sources, HDF 850.1 ({\$}z{\$}=5.183) and AzTEC-3 ({\$}z{\$}=5.298), were previously known.

This result may suggest that different fractions of the massive gas reservoirs are located in the dense, star-forming nuclear regions - consistent with the more extended sizes of the [CII] emission compared to the dust continuum and higher [CII]-to-far-infrared luminosity ratios in those galaxies with lower gas excitation. We thus find substantial variations in the conditions for star formation between {\$}z{\$}{\$}{\textgreater}{\$}5 dusty starbursts, which typically have dust temperatures {\$}\backslashsim{\$}57{\%}{\$}\backslashpm{\$}25{\%} warmer than starbursts at {\$}z{\$}=2-3 due to their enhanced star formation activity.},

abstract = {Using the Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 imaging data and multi-wavelength photometric catalog, we investigated the dust temperature of passively evolving and star-forming galaxies at 0.2{\textless}z{\textless}1.0 in the CANDELS fields. We estimated the stellar radiation field by low-mass stars from the stellar mass and surface brightness profile of these galaxies and then calculated their steady-state dust temperature. At first, we tested our method using nearby early-type galaxies with the deep FIR data by the Herschel Virgo cluster survey and confirmed that the estimated dust temperatures are consistent with the observed temperatures within the uncertainty. We then applied the method to galaxies at 0.2{\textless}z{\textless}1.0, and found that most of passively evolving galaxies with Mstar {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}} Msun have a relatively high dust temperature of Tdust {\textgreater} 20 K, for which the formation efficiency of molecular hydrogen on the surface of dust grains in the diffuse ISM is expected to be very low from the laboratory experiments. The fraction of passively evolving galaxies strongly depends on the expected dust temperature at all redshifts and increases rapidly with increasing the temperature around Tdust {\~{}} 20 K. These results suggest that the dust heating by low-mass stars in massive galaxies plays an important role for the continuation of their passive evolution, because the lack of the shielding effect of the molecular hydrogen on the UV radiation can prevent the gas cooling and formation of new stars.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of a galaxy cluster at z = 1.62 located in the Spitzer Wide-Area Infrared Extragalactic survey XMM-LSS field. This structure was selected solely as an overdensity of galaxies with red Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera colors, satisfying ([3.6] - [4.5])AB{\textgreater} - 0.1 mag. Photometric redshifts derived from the Subaru XMM Deep Survey (BViz bands), the UKIRT Infrared Deep Survey-Ultra-Deep Survey (UKIDSS-UDS, JK bands), and from the Spitzer Public UDS survey (3.6-8.0 $\mu$m) show that this cluster corresponds to a surface density of galaxies at z ≈ 1.6 that is {\textgreater}20$\sigma$ above the mean at this redshift. We obtained optical spectroscopic observations of galaxies in the cluster region using IMACS on the Magellan telescope. We measured redshifts for seven galaxies in the range z = 1.62-1.63 within 2.8 arcmin ({\textless}1.4 Mpc) of the astrometric center of the cluster. A posteriori analysis of the XMM data in this field reveal a weak (4$\sigma$) detection in the [0.5-2 keV] band compatible with the expected thermal emission from such a cluster. The color-magnitude diagram of the galaxies in this cluster shows a prominent red sequence, dominated by a population of red galaxies with (z - J){\textgreater}1.7 mag. The photometric-redshift probability distributions for the red galaxies are strongly peaked at z = 1.62, coincident with the spectroscopically confirmed galaxies. The rest-frame (U - B) color and scatter of galaxies on the red sequence are consistent with a mean luminosity-weighted age of 1.2 ± 0.1 Gyr, yielding a formation redshift $\backslash$overline{\{}z{\_}f{\}}=2.35 ± 0.10, and corresponding to the last significant star formation period in these galaxies. This work is based in part on observations made with the Spitzer Space Telescope, which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, California Institute of Technology, under NASA contract 1407.

@article{Kormendy2013,
abstract = {Supermassive black holes (BHs) have been found in 85 galaxies by dynamical modeling of spatially resolved kinematics. The Hubble Space Telescope revolutionized BH research by advancing the subject from its proof-of-concept phase into quantitative studies of BH demographics. Most influential was the discovery of a tight correlation between BH mass and the velocity dispersion $\sigma$ of the bulge component of the host galaxy. Together with similar correlations with bulge luminosity and mass, this led to the widespread belief that BHs and bulges coevolve by regulating each other's growth. Conclusions based on one set of correlations from in brightest cluster ellipticals to in the smallest galaxies dominated BH work for more than a decade. New results are now replacing this simple story with a richer and more plausible picture in which BHs correlate differently with different galaxy components. A reasonable aim is to use this progress to refine our understanding of BH-galaxy coevolution. BHs with masses of 105-106Mȯ are found in many bulgeless galaxies. Therefore, classical (elliptical-galaxy-like) bulges are not necessary for BH formation. On the other hand, although they live in galaxy disks, BHs do not correlate with galaxy disks. Also, any correlations with the properties of disk-grown pseudobulges and dark matter halos are weak enough to imply no close coevolution. The above and other correlations of host-galaxy parameters with each other and with suggest that there are four regimes of BH feedback. (1) Local, secular, episodic, and stochastic feeding of small BHs in largely bulgeless galaxies involves too little energy to result in coevolution. (2) Global feeding in major, wet galaxy mergers rapidly grows giant BHs in short-duration, quasar-like events whose energy feedback does affect galaxy evolution. The resulting hosts are classical bulges and coreless-rotating-disky ellipticals. (3) After these AGN phases and at the highest galaxy masses, maintenance-mode BH feedback into X-ray-emitting gas has the primarily negative effect of helping to keep baryons locked up in hot gas and thereby keeping galaxy formation from going to completion. This happens in giant, core-nonrotating-boxy ellipticals. Their properties, including their tight correlations between and core parameters, support the conclusion that core ellipticals form by dissipationless major mergers. They inherit coevolution effects from smaller progenitor galaxies. Also, (4) independent of any feedback physics, in BH growth modes 2 and 3, the averaging that results from successive mergers plays a major role in decreasing the scatter in correlations from the large values observed in bulgeless and pseudobulge galaxies to the small values observed in giant elliptical galaxies.Copyright {\textcopyright}2013 by Annual Reviews.

abstract = {The origin of the correlations between mass, morphology, quenched fraction, and formation history in galaxies is difficult to define, primarily due to the uncertainties in galaxy star-formation histories. Star-formation histories are better constrained for higher redshift galaxies, observed closer to their formation and quenching epochs. Here we use "non-parametric" star-formation histories and a nested sampling method to derive constraints on the formation and quenching timescales of quiescent galaxies at {\$}0.7{\textless}z{\textless}2.5{\$}. We model deep HST grism spectroscopy and photometry from the CLEAR (CANDELS Lyman{\$}-\backslashalpha{\$} Emission at Reionization) survey. The galaxy formation redshifts, {\$}z{\_}{\{}50{\}}{\$} (defined as the point where they had formed 50$\backslash${\%} of their stellar mass) range from {\$}z{\_}{\{}50{\}}\backslashsim 2{\$} (shortly prior to the observed epoch) up to {\$}z{\_}{\{}50{\}} \backslashsimeq 5-8{\$}. $\backslash$editone{\{}We find that early formation redshifts are correlated with high stellar-mass surface densities, {\$}\backslashlog \backslashSigma{\_}1 / (M{\_}\backslashodot\backslash \backslashmathrm{\{}kpc{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}) {\textgreater}{\$}10.25, where {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}1{\$} is the stellar mass within 1{\~{}}pkpc (proper kpc).

Quiescent galaxies with lower surface density, {\$}\backslashlog \backslashSigma{\_}1 / (M{\_}\backslashodot\backslash \backslashmathrm{\{}kpc{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}) = 9.5 - 10.25{\$}, show a range of formation epochs ({\$}z{\_}{\{}50{\}} \backslashsimeq 1.5 - 8{\$}), implying these galaxies experienced a range of formation and assembly histories. We argue that the surface density threshold {\$}\backslashlog\backslashSigma{\_}1/(M{\_}\backslashodot\backslash \backslashmathrm{\{}kpc{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}){\textgreater}10.25{\$} uniquely identifies galaxies that formed in the first few Gyr after the Big Bang, and we discuss the implications this has for galaxy formation models.},

@article{Tully2014,
abstract = {Galaxies congregate in clusters and along filaments, and are missing from large regions referred to as voids. These structures are seen in maps derived from spectroscopic surveys that reveal networks of structure that are interconnected with no clear boundaries. Extended regions with a high concentration of galaxies are called 'superclusters', although this term is not precise. There is, however, another way to analyse the structure. If the distance to each galaxy from Earth is directly measured, then the peculiar velocity can be derived from the subtraction of the mean cosmic expansion, the product of distance times the Hubble constant, from observed velocity. The peculiar velocity is the line-of-sight departure from the cosmic expansion and arises from gravitational perturbations; a map of peculiar velocities can be translated into a map of the distribution of matter. Here we report a map of structure made using a catalogue of peculiar velocities. We find locations where peculiar velocity flows diverge, as water does at watershed divides, and we trace the surface of divergent points that surrounds us. Within the volume enclosed by this surface, the motions of galaxies are inward after removal of the mean cosmic expansion and long range flows. We define a supercluster to be the volume within such a surface, and so we are defining the extent of our home supercluster, which we call Laniakea. A key component of this paper is an accompanying movie that can be viewed (also in 3D) and downloaded at http://irfu.cea.fr/laniakea or http://vimeo.com/pomarede/laniakea},

We use these unique systems to test the consistency of IMF estimates derived from different methods. We first estimate the stellar {\$}M{\_}*/L{\$} using lensing and stellar dynamics.

The other two galaxies show 2-3{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} tension with lensing estimates, depending on the dark matter contribution, when considering IMFs that extend to 0.08 Msol. Allowing a variable low-mass cutoff or a nonparametric form of the IMF reduces the tension among the IMF estimates to {\$}{\textless}2\backslashsigma{\$}. There is moderate evidence for a reduced number of low-mass stars in the SNELLS spectra, but no such evidence in a composite spectrum of matched-{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} ETGs drawn from the SDSS. Such variation in the form of the IMF at low stellar masses (m {\textless}{\~{}} 0.03 Msol), if present, could reconcile lensing/dynamical and spectroscopic IMF estimates for the SNELLS lenses and account for their lighter {\$}M{\_}*/L{\$} relative to the mean matched-{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} ETG.

They are distributed over wide ranges of FIR size from {\$}R{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}e,FIR{\}}={\$}0.4 kpc to {\$}R{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}e,FIR{\}}={\$}6 kpc.

abstract = {This paper presents new deep and wide narrow-band surveys undertaken with United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT), Subaru and the Very Large Telescope (VLT), a unique combined effort to select large, robust samples of H$\alpha$ star-forming galaxies at z = 0.40, 0.84, 1.47 and 2.23 (corresponding to look-back times of 4.2, 7.0, 9.2 and 10.6 Gyr) in a uniform manner over ˜2 deg2 in the Cosmological Evolution Survey and Ultra Deep Survey fields. The deep multi-epoch H$\alpha$ surveys reach a matched 3$\sigma$ flux limit of ≈3 M⊙ yr-1 out to z = 2.2 for the first time, while the wide area and the coverage over two independent fields allow us to greatly overcome cosmic variance and assemble by far the largest samples of H$\alpha$ emitters. Catalogues are presented for a total of 1742, 637, 515 and 807 H$\alpha$ emitters, robustly selected at z = 0.40, 0.84, 1.47 and 2.23, respectively, and used to determine the H$\alpha$ luminosity function and its evolution. The faint-end slope of the H$\alpha$ luminosity function is found to be $\alpha$ = -1.60 ± 0.08 over z = 0-2.23, showing no significant evolution. The characteristic luminosity of star-forming galaxies, L*H$\alpha$, evolves significantly as log L*H$\alpha$(z) = 0.45z + log L*z = 0. This is the first time H$\alpha$ has been used to trace star formation activity with a single homogeneous survey at z = 0.4-2.23. Overall, the evolution seen with H$\alpha$ is in good agreement with the evolution seen using inhomogeneous compilations of other tracers of star formation, such as far-infrared and ultraviolet, jointly pointing towards the bulk of the evolution in the last 11 Gyr being driven by a statistically similar star-forming population across cosmic time, but with a strong luminosity increase from z ˜ 0 to ˜2.2. Our uniform analysis allows us to derive the H$\alpha$ star formation history (SFRH) of the Universe, showing a clear rise up to z ˜ 2.2, for which the simple parametrization log10$\rho$SFR = -2.1(1 + z)-1 is valid over 80 per cent of the age of the Universe. The results reveal that both the shape and normalization of the H$\alpha$ SFRH are consistent with the measurements of the stellar mass density growth, confirming that our H$\alpha$ SFRH is tracing the bulk of the formation of stars in the Universe for z {\textless} 2.23. The star formation activity over the last ˜11 Gyr is responsible for producing ˜95 per cent of the total stellar mass density observed locally, with half of that being assembled in 2 Gyr between z = 1.2 and 2.2, and the other half in 8 Gyr (since z {\textless} 1.2). If the star formation rate density continues to decline with time in the same way as seen in the past ˜11 Gyr, then the stellar mass density of the Universe will reach a maximum which is only 5 per cent higher than the present-day value.},

Using dust-corrected measurements of the distribution of Ha emission, we measure the radial profiles of star formation in a sample of 201 star-forming galaxies covering three orders of magnitude in stellar mass (M*; 108.1-1010.95M⊙) and in fifth nearest neighbour local environment density (∑5; 10-1.3-102.1 Mpc-2). We show that star formation rate gradients in galaxies are steeper in dense (log10(∑5/Mpc2) {\textgreater} 0.5) environments by 0.58 ± 0.29 dex re-1 in galaxies with stellar masses in the range 1010 {\textless} M*/M⊙ {\textless} 1011 and that this steepening is accompanied by a reduction in the integrated star formation rate. However, for any given stellar mass or environment density, the star formation morphology of galaxies shows large scatter. We also measure the degree to which the star formation is centrally concentrated using the unitless scale-radius ratio (r50,H$\alpha$/r50,cont), which compares the extent of ongoing star formation to previous star formation. With this metric, we find that the fraction of galaxies with centrally concentrated star formation increases with environment density, from {\~{}}5 ± 4 per cent in low-density environments (log10(∑5/Mpc2) {\textless} 0.0) to 30 ± 15 per cent in the highest density environments (log10(∑5/Mpc2) {\textgreater} 1.0). These lines of evidence strongly suggest that with increasing local environment density, the star formation in galaxies is suppressed, and that this starts in their outskirts such that quenching occurs in an outside-in fashion in dense environments and is not instantaneous.},

All of the galaxies have spectroscopic redshifts in the range z = 2 to 6.5. The presence of the CIV absorption feature, indicating that the rest-frame UV-optical SED is dominated by OB stars, is used to select objects for which the intrinsic, unattenuated spectrum has a well-established shape. Comparison of this intrinsic spectrum with the observed broadband photometric SED then permits derivation of the wavelength dependence of the dust attenuation. The derived dust attenuation curve is similar in overall shape to the Calzetti curve for local starburst galaxies. We also see the 2175 $\backslash$AA{\~{}}bump feature which is present in the Milky Way and LMC extinction curves but not seen in the Calzetti curve. The bump feature is commonly attributed to graphite or PAHs. No significant dependence is seen with redshift between sub-samples at z = 2 - 4 and z = 4 - 6.5.

abstract = {We investigate the evolution of the H$\alpha$ equivalent width, EW(H$\alpha$), with redshift and its dependence on stellar mass, using the first data from the 3D-HST survey, a large spectroscopic Treasury program with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3. Combining our H$\alpha$ measurements of 854 galaxies at 0.8 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.5 with those of ground-based surveys at lower and higher redshift, we can consistently determine the evolution of the EW(H$\alpha$) distribution from z = 0 to z = 2.2. We find that at all masses the characteristic EW(H$\alpha$) is decreasing toward the present epoch, and that at each redshift the EW(H$\alpha$) is lower for high-mass galaxies. We find EW(H$\alpha$) {\~{}}(1 + z)1.8 with little mass dependence. Qualitatively, this measurement is a model-independent confirmation of the evolution of star-forming galaxies with redshift. A quantitative conversion of EW(H$\alpha$) to specific star formation rate (sSFR) is model dependent because of differential reddening corrections between the continuum and the Balmer lines. The observed EW(H$\alpha$) can be reproduced with the characteristic evolutionary history for galaxies, whose star formation rises with cosmic time to z {\~{}} 2.5 and then decreases to z = 0. This implies that EW(H$\alpha$) rises to 400 {\AA} at z = 8. The sSFR evolves faster than EW(H$\alpha$), as the mass-to-light ratio also evolves with redshift. We find that the sSFR evolves as (1 + z)3.2, nearly independent of mass, consistent with previous reddening insensitive estimates. We confirm previous results that the observed slope of the sSFR-z relation is steeper than the one predicted by models, but models and observations agree in finding little mass dependence.

abstract = {In this work we study a system of two galaxies, Astarte and Adonis, at z {\$}\backslashsim {\$}2 when the Universe was undergoing its peak of star formation activity. Astarte is a dusty star-forming galaxy at the massive-end of the main sequence (MS) and Adonis is a less-massive, bright in ultraviolet (UV), companion galaxy with an optical spectroscopic redshift. We analyse the physical properties of this system, and probe the gas mass of Astarte with its ALMA CO emission, to investigate whether this ultra-massive galaxy is quenching or not. We use CIGALE - a spectral energy distribution modeling code - to derive the key physical properties of Astarte and Adonis, mainly their star formation rates (SFRs), stellar masses, and dust luminosities. We inspect the variation of the physical parameters depending on the assumed dust attenuation law. We also estimate the molecular gas mass of Astarte from its CO emission, using different {\$}\backslashalpha{\_}{\{}CO{\}}{\$} and transition ratios ({\$}r{\_}{\{}31{\}}{\$}) and discuss the implication of the various assumptions on the gas mass derivation. We find that Astarte exhibits a MS-like star formation activity, while Adonis is undergoing a strong starburst (SB) phase. The molecular gas mass of Astarte is far below the gas fraction of typical star-forming galaxies at z=2. This low gas content and high SFR, result in a depletion time of {\$}0.22\backslashpm0.07{\$} Gyrs, slightly shorter than what is expected for a MS galaxy at this redshift. The CO luminosity versus the total IR luminosity suggests a MS-like activity assuming a galactic conversion factor and a low transition ratio. The SFR of Astarte is of the same order using different attenuation laws, unlike its stellar mass that increases using shallow attenuation laws. We discuss these properties and suggest that Astarte might be experiencing a recent decrease of star formation activity and is quenching through the MS following a SB epoch.},

abstract = {In this study we present the exploration of ∼ 500 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies in and around two large scale structures at z ∼ 1 drawn from the ORELSE sur-vey. A sub-sample of these galaxies (∼ 150) were targeted for the initial phases of a near-infrared MOSFIRE spectroscopic campaign investigating the differences in selec-tions of galaxies which had recently ended a burst of star formation or had rapidly quenched (i.e., post-starburst or K+A galaxies). Selection with MOSFIRE resulted in a post-starburst sample more than double that selected by traditional z ∼ 1 (observed-frame optical) methods even after the removal of the relatively large fraction of dusty starburst galaxies selected through traditional methods. While the traditional post-starburst fraction increased with increased global density, the MOSFIRE-selected post-starburst fraction was found to be constant in field, group, and cluster environments. However, this fraction relative to the number of galaxies with ongoing star forma-tion was observed to elevate in the cluster environment. Post-starbursts selected with MOSFIRE were predominantly found to exhibit moderately strong [OII] emission originating from activity other than star formation. Such galaxies, termed K+A with ImposteR [OII]-derived Star formation (KAIROS) galaxies, were found to be consid-erably younger than traditionally-selected post-starbursts and likely undergoing some form of feedback absent or diminished in traditional post-starbursts. A comparison between the environments of the two types of post-starbursts suggests a picture in which the evolution of a post-starburst galaxy is considerably different in cluster en-vironments than in the more rarefied environments of a group or the field.},

The dispersion of the SFR{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm 5Myr{\}}{\$}/SFR{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm 800Myr{\}}{\$} at a given relative galactic radius and a given stellar mass decreases with the (indirectly inferred) gas depletion time: locations with short gas depletion time appear to undergo bigger variations in their star-formation rates on Gyr or less timescales.

In this paper, we can now prove directly with SFR{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm 5Myr{\}}{\$}/SFR{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm 800Myr{\}}{\$} that these effects are indeed due to genuine temporal variations in the SFR of individual galaxies on timescales between {\$}10{\^{}}7{\$} and {\$}10{\^{}}9{\$} years rather than possibly reflecting intrinsic, non-temporal, differences between different galaxies.},

abstract = {We present a study of the influence of galaxy mergers on star formation at 0.3{\textless}z{\textless}2.5. Major mergers are selected from the CANDELS/3D-HST catalog using a peak-finding algorithm. Mergers have projected galaxy nuclei separation of their members between 3-15 kpc. We compare the star formation activity in merging and non-merging galaxies and find no significant differences. We find that only 12{\%} of the galaxies in major mergers (in which both galaxies have log(M/Msun){\textgreater}10) are star-bursting (i.e., with SFR above the main sequence of star-forming galaxies by {\textgreater}0.5 dex). Merging galaxies which include galaxies with lower masses show a higher fraction of star-bursting galaxies (20{\%}). The low fraction of star-bursting merging galaxies in this sample suggests that at galaxy nuclei separations of 3-15 kpc merging galaxies are still in a early stage and are yet to reach the maximum level of star formation activity. Furthermore, the level of star formation enhancement and its duration could be arguably reduced compared to local mergers, as shown by simulations of high-z mergers, and might also depend on the physical properties (such as stellar mass and gas fraction) of the merging galaxies. Finally, we compare the specific SFR between merging galaxies. Our results suggest that, as the mass of the merging galaxies increases, the star formation activity in the less massive member in the merger suffers a more dramatic impact than its companion galaxy.},

Instead of the half-light radius r{\_}50 we use r{\_}80, the radius containing 80{\%} of the stellar light. We find that the r{\_}80 -- M{\_}star relation has the form of a broken power law, with a clear change of slope at a pivot mass M{\_}p. Below the pivot mass the relation is shallow (r{\_}80 $\backslash$propto M{\_}star{\^{}}0.15) and above it it is steep (r{\_}80$\backslash$propto M{\_}star{\^{}}0.6). The pivot mass increases with redshift, from log(M{\_}p/M{\_}sun){\~{}} 10.2 at z=0.4 to log(M{\_}p/M{\_}sun){\~{}} 10.9 at z=1.7-3. We compare these r{\_}80-M{\_}star relations to the M{\_}halo-M{\_}star relations derived from galaxy-galaxy lensing, clustering analyses, and abundance matching techniques. Remarkably, the pivot stellar masses of both relations are consistent with each other at all redshifts, and the slopes are very similar both above and below the pivot when assuming M{\_}halo $\backslash$propto r{\_}80{\^{}}3. The implied scaling factor to relate galaxy size to halo size is r{\_}80 / R{\_}vir = 0.047, independent of stellar mass and redshift.From redshift 0 to 1.5, the pivot mass also coincides with the mass where the fraction of star-forming galaxies is 50{\%}, suggesting that the pivot mass reflects a transition from dissipational to dissipationless galaxy growth. Finally, our results imply that the scatter in the stellar-to-halo mass ratio is relatively small for massive halos ({\~{}}0.2 dex for M{\_}halo{\textgreater}10{\^{}}12.5 M{\_}sun).},

Two-component fits show that most green galaxies have significant bulge and disk components and that the blue to red evolution is driven by colour change in the disk. Together, these strongly suggest that galaxies evolve from blue to red through secular disk fading and that a strong bulge is present prior to any decline in star formation. The relative abundance of the green population implies a typical timescale for traversing the green valley {\$}\backslashsim 1-2{\$}{\~{}}Gyr and is independent of environment, unlike that of the red and blue populations. While environment likely plays a r$\backslash${\^{}}ole in triggering the passage across the green valley, it appears to have little effect on time taken. These results are consistent with a green valley population dominated by (early type) disk galaxies that are insufficiently supplied with gas to maintain previous levels of disk star formation, eventually attaining passive colours.

These data are used to constrain the extinction law in the UV for our galaxies and to compare the absorbed radiation in the UV range with the emission in the IR range. We find that the modelled far- and near-UV apparent magnitudes are in good agreement with the observed GALEX magnitudes. It is found that galaxies with low and high equivalent widths EW(Hbeta) of the Hbeta emission line require different reddening laws with steeper slopes for galaxies with higher EW(H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$}). This implies an important role of the hard ionising radiation in shaping the dust grain size distribution. The IR emission in the range of 8-1000 mum is determined using existing data obtained by various infrared space telescopes. We find that the radiation energy absorbed in the UV range is nearly equal to the energy emitted in the IR range leaving very little room for hidden star formation in our galaxies. Using extinction-corrected Hbeta luminosities and modelled SEDs in the UV range we derive efficiencies of ionising photon production $\backslash$xi for the entire sample of CSFGs. It is found that {\$}\backslashxi{\$} in CSFGs with high EW(Hbeta) are among the highest known for low- and high-redshift galaxies.

abstract = {We investigate the emission-line properties of galaxies with red rest-frame colors using spectra from SDSS DR4. Emission lines are detected in more than half of the red galaxies. We focus on the relationship between two emission lines commonly used as star formation rate indicators: Ha 6563 and [OII] 3727. There is a strong bimodality in [OII]/Ha ratio in the full SDSS sample which closely corresponds to the bimodality in rest-frame color. Nearly all of the line-emitting red galaxies have line ratios typical of various types of AGN -- most commonly LINERs, a small fraction of transition objects and, more rarely, Seyferts. Only {\~{}}6{\%} of red galaxies display star-forming line ratios. A straight line in the [OII]-Ha equivalent width plane separates LINER-like galaxies from other categories. Quiescent galaxies with no detectable emission lines and LINER-like galaxies combine to form a single, tight red sequence in color-magnitude-concentration space. [OII] EWs in LINER- and AGN-like galaxies can be as large as in star-forming galaxies. Thus, unless objects with AGN/LINER-like line ratios are excluded, [OII] emission cannot be used directly as a proxy for star formation rate. Lack of [OII] emission is generally used to indicate lack of star formation when post-starburst galaxies are selected at high redshift. Our results imply, however, that these samples have been cut on AGN properties as well as star formation, and therefore may provide seriously incomplete sets of post-starburst galaxies. Furthermore, post-starburst galaxies identifed in SDSS by requiring minimal Ha EW generally exhibit weak but nonzero line emission with ratios typical of AGNs; few of them show residual star formation. This suggests that most post-starbursts may harbor AGNs/LINERs.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of possible overdensities of galaxies at z 3.7 in Chandra Deep Field-South (CDF-S). These overdensities are identified from a photometric redshift-selected sample and a BVz-selected sample. One overdensity is identified in the proximity of two active galactic nuclei and Lyman break galaxies at z = 3.66 and z = 3.70 at 7$\sigma$ significance level. The other overdensity is less significant. It is identified around six z spec ≃ 3.6 galaxies at 3$\sigma$ significance level. The line-of-sight velocity dispersions of these overdensities are found to be $\sigma$v ≃ 500-800 km s-1, comparable to the velocity dispersions of clusters of galaxies today. Through spectral energy distribution fitting, we find 15 massive galaxies with M ≳ 1011M around the z ≃ 3.7 overdensity. The mass of the z ≃ 3.7 overdensity is found to be a few ×1014M. Our result suggests that high-redshift overdense regions can be found in a supposedly blank field, and that the emergence of massive structures can be traced back to redshifts as high as z 3.7. {\textcopyright} 2009.

abstract = {Dust attenuation affects nearly all observational aspects of galaxy evolution, yet very little is known about the form of the dust-attenuation law in the distant Universe. Here, we model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies at z = 1.5--3 from CANDELS with rest-frame UV to near-IR imaging under different assumptions about the dust law, and compare the amount of inferred attenuated light with the observed infrared (IR) luminosities. Some individual galaxies show strong Bayesian evidence in preference of one dust law over another, and this preference agrees with their observed location on the plane of infrared excess (IRX, {\$}L{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}TIR{\}}{\}}/L{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}UV{\}}{\}}{\$}) and UV slope ({\$}\backslashbeta{\$}). We generalize the shape of the dust law with an empirical model, {\$}A{\_}{\{}\backslashlambda,\backslashdelta{\}}=E(B-V)\backslash k{\_}\backslashlambda\backslash (\backslashlambda/\backslashlambda{\_}V){\^{}}\backslashdelta{\$} where {\$}k{\_}\backslashlambda{\$} is the dust law of Calzetti et al.

Galaxies with high color excess have a shallower, starburst-like law, and those with low color excess have a steeper, SMC-like law. Surprisingly, the galaxies in our sample show no correlation between the shape of the dust law and stellar mass, star-formation rate, or {\$}\backslashbeta{\$}. The change in the dust law with color excess is consistent with a model where attenuation is caused by by scattering, a mixed star-dust geometry, and/or trends with stellar population age, metallicity, and dust grain size. This rest-frame UV-to-near-IR method shows potential to constrain the dust law at even higher ({\$}z{\textgreater}3{\$}) redshifts.},

abstract = {We determine an absolute calibration of the initial mass function (IMF) of early-type galaxies, by studying a sample of 56 gravitational lenses identified by the Sloan Lenses ACS Survey. Under the assumption of standard Navarro, Frenk, and White dark matter halos, a combination of lensing, dynamical, and stellar population synthesis models is used to disentangle the stellar and dark matter contribution for each lens. We define an “IMF mismatch” parameter $\alpha$ ≡M∗LDEin/M∗SPSEin as the ratio of stellar mass inferred by a joint lensing and dynamical model (M∗LDEin) to the current stellar mass inferred from stellar populations synthesis models (M∗SPSEin). We find that a Salpeter IMF provides stellar masses in agreement with those inferred by lensing and dynamical models (log $\alpha$ = −0.00 ± 0.03 ± 0.02), while a Chabrier IMF underestimates them (log $\alpha$ = 0.25 ± 0.03 ± 0.02). A tentative trend is found, in the sense that $\alpha$ appears to increase with galaxy velocity dispersion. Taken at face value, this result would imply a non-universal IMF, perhaps dependent on metallicity, age, or abundance ratios of the stellar populations. Alternatively, the observed trend may imply non-universal dark matter halos with inner density slope increasing with velocity dispersion. While the degeneracy between the two interpretations cannot be broken without additional information, the data imply that massive early-type galaxies cannot have both a universal IMF and universal dark matter halos.},

abstract = {We address the formation of massive stellar spheroids between redshifts z = 4 and 1 using a suite of adaptive mesh refinement hydrocosmological simulations. The spheroids form as bulges, and the spheroid mass growth is partly driven by violent disc instability (VDI) and partly by mergers. A kinematic decomposition to disc and spheroid yields that the mass fraction in the spheroid is between 50 and 90 per cent and is roughly constant in time, consistent with a cosmological steady state of VDI discs that are continuously fed from the cosmic web. The density profile of the spheroid is typically `classical', with a S{\'{e}}rsic index n = 4.5 ± 1, independent of whether it grew by mergers or VDI and independent of the feedback strength. The disc is characterized by n = 1.5 ± 0.5, and the whole galaxy by n = 3 ± 1. The high-redshift spheroids are compact due to the dissipative inflow of gas and the high universal density. The stellar surface density within the effective radius of each galaxy as it evolves remains roughly constant in time after its first growth. For galaxies of a fixed stellar mass, the surface density is higher at higher redshifts.},

Cosmological simulations using the current cold dark matter paradigm predict these systems should descend from "proto-clusters" - early over-densities of massive galaxies that merge hierarchically to form a cluster. These proto-cluster regions themselves are built-up hierarchically and so are expected to contain extremely massive galaxies which can be observed as luminous quasars and starbursts. However, observational evidence for this scenario is sparse due to the fact that high-redshift proto-clusters are rare and difficult to observe. Here we report a proto-cluster region 1 billion years (z=5.3) after the Big Bang. This cluster of massive galaxies extends over {\textgreater}13 Mega-parsecs, contains a luminous quasar as well as a system rich in molecular gas.

abstract = {We measure star formation rates of {\~{}}50,000 optically-selected galaxies in the local universe (z{\~{}}0.1), spanning a range from gas-rich dwarfs to massive ellipticals. We obtain dust-corrected SFRs by fitting the GALEX (UV) and SDSS (optical) photometry to a library of population synthesis models that include dust attenuation. For star-forming galaxies, our UV-based SFRs compare remarkably well with those derived from SDSS H alpha. Deviations from perfect agreement between these two methods are due to differences in the dust attenuation estimates. In contrast to H alpha, UV provides reliable SFRs for galaxies with weak or no H alpha emission, and where H alpha is contaminated with an emission from an AGN. We use full-SED SFRs to calibrate a simple prescription that uses GALEX UV magnitudes to produce good SFRs for normal star-forming galaxies. The specific SFR is considered as a function of stellar mass for (1) star-forming galaxies with no AGN, (2) those hosting an AGN, and for (3) galaxies without H alpha emission. We find that the three have distinct star formation histories, with AGN lying intermediate between the star-forming and the quiescent galaxies. Normal star forming galaxies (without an AGN) lie on a relatively narrow linear sequence. Remarkably, galaxies hosting a strong AGN appear to represent the massive continuation of this sequence. Weak AGN, while also massive, have lower SFR, sometimes extending to the realm of quiescent galaxies. We propose an evolutionary sequence for massive galaxies that smoothly connects normal star-forming galaxies to quiescent (red sequence) galaxies via strong and weak AGN. We confirm that some galaxies with no H alpha emission show signs of SF in the UV. We derive a UV-based cosmic SFR density at z=0.1 with smaller total error than previous measurements (abridged).},

abstract = {We develop a method for interpreting faint galaxy data which focuses on the integrated light radiated from the galaxy population as a whole. The emission history of the universe at ultraviolet, optical, and near-infrared wavelengths is modeled from the present epoch to z{\~{}}4 by tracing the evolution with cosmic time of the galaxy luminosity density, as determined from several deep spectroscopic samples and the Hubble Deep Field (HDF) imaging survey. The global spectrophotometric properties of field galaxies can be well fit by a simple stellar evolution model, defined by a time-dependent star formation rate (SFR) per unit comoving volume and a universal IMF extending from 0.1 to 125 M{\_}sun. In the best-fit models, the global SFR rises sharply, by about an order of magnitude, from a redshift of zero to a peak value at z{\~{}}1.5, to fall again at higher redshifts. The models are able to account for the entire background light recorded in the galaxy counts down to the very faint magnitude levels probed by the HDF. Since only 20{\%} of the current stellar content of galaxies is produced at z{\textgreater}2, a rather low cosmic metallicity is expected at these early times, in good agreement with the observed enrichment history of the damped Lyman-$\backslash$alpha systems. A ``monolithic collapse'' model, where half of the present-day stars formed at z{\textgreater}2.5 and were shrouded by dust, can be made consistent with the global history of light, but overpredicts the metal mass density at high redshifts as sampled by QSO absorbers.},

At {\$}z\backslashlesssim{\$} 1, denser environments more efficiently quench galaxies with higher masses (log({\$}M/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}){\$}\backslashgtrsim{\$} 10.7), possibly due to a higher merger rate of massive galaxies in denser environments, and that mass quenching is more efficient in denser regions.

abstract = {A common assumption is that galaxies fall in two distinct regions on a plot of specific star-formation rate (SSFR) versus galaxy stellar mass: a star-forming Galaxy Main Sequence (GMS) and a separate region of 'passive' or 'red and dead galaxies'. Starting from a volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies designed to contain most of the stellar mass in this volume, and thus being a fair representation of the Universe at the end of ≃12 billion years of galaxy evolution, we investigate the distribution of galaxies in this diagram today. We show that galaxies follow a strongly curved extended GMS with a steep negative slope at high galaxy stellar masses. There is a gradual change in the morphologies of the galaxies along this distribution, but there is no clear break between early-type and late-type galaxies. Examining the other evidence that there are two distinct populations, we argue that the 'red sequence' is the result of the colours of galaxies changing very little below a critical value of the SSFR, rather than implying a distinct population of galaxies, and that Herschel observations, which show at least half of early-type galaxies contain a cool interstellar medium, also imply continuity between early-type and late-type galaxies. This picture of a unitary population of galaxies requires more gradual evolutionary processes than the rapid quenching processes needed to to explain two distinct populations. We challenge theorists to reproduce the properties of this 'Galaxy End Sequence'.},

We determine the SFHs of individual galaxies by simultaneously fitting rest-frame optical spectroscopy and broadband photometry to stellar population models. We confirm that the SFHs are consistent with more massive galaxies having on average earlier formation times. Comparing galaxies found in massive clusters with those in the field, we find galaxies with M∗ {\textless} 1011.3 M in the field have more extended SFHs. From the SFHs we calculate the mass-weighted ages, and compare age distributions of galaxies between the two environments, at fixed mass. We constrain the difference in mass-weighted ages between field and cluster galaxies to 0.31+0.51−0.33 Gyr, in the sense that cluster galaxies are older. We place this result in the context of two simple quenching models and show that neither environmental quenching based on time since infall (without pre-processing) nor a difference in formation times alone can reproduce both the average age difference and relative quenched fractions. This is distinctly different from local clusters, for which the majority of the quenched population is consistent with having been environmentally quenched upon infall. Our results suggest that quenched population in galaxy clusters at z {\textgreater} 1 has been driven by different physical processes than those at play at z = 0.},

The wide wavelength range of the VLT/X-Shooter spectroscopic data in the UV-Optical-NIR arms along with the availability of spectro-photometry allows us to explore different techniques to obtain the stellar population properties, namely through age/metallicity sensitive spectral indices, full spectral fitting and broad-band photometric fitting. Moreover, together with the widely used optical Lick indices we consider further indices in the UV rest-frame, and demonstrate that UV indices significantly help the accuracy of the resulting population parameters. We find galaxy ages ranging from 0.2 to 4 Gyr, where the oldest galaxy is found at the lowest redshift, with an excellent agreement between ages determined via indices, full spectral fitting or broad-band colours. These ages are in perfect agreement with ages of local galaxies at the same velocity dispersion when we assume pure passive evolution. Total metallicities derived from indices show some scatter (between less than half-solar to very high values, ([Z/H]{\~{}}0.6]). We speculate on possible mechanisms explaining these values, but given the sample size and low S/N of the spectra no conclusion can be made. Indices in the UV-rest frame generally lead to similar conclusions as optical indices. For the oldest galaxy (4 Gyr) we show that its UV-indices can only be explained by stellar population models including a UV contribution from old stellar populations, suggesting that old, UV bright populations start to inhabit mature galaxies of a few Gyr of age. This is the highest redshift (z{\~{}}1.4) detection of the UV-upturn up to date.},

abstract = {The general consensus is that LTGs undergo intense star-formation activity, while ETGs are mostly inactive. We question this general rule and investigate the existence of star-forming ETGs and quiescent LTGs in the local Universe. By computing the physical properties of 2,209 such galaxies in the GAMA survey being morphologically classified and using information on their structural properties as well as the density of their local environment, we seek for understanding the differences from their 'typical' counterparts. We separate galaxies into subsets based on their dominant ionising process, making use of criteria based on the WH{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashalpha{\}}{\$} width and the [NII/H{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashalpha{\}}{\$}] ratio. Taking advantage of the SED fitting code CIGALE we derive galaxy properties, such as the {\$}M{\_}\backslashtext{\{}star{\}}{\$}, {\$}M{\_}\backslashtext{\{}dust{\}}{\$}, and SFR and also estimate the unattenuated and the dust-absorbed stellar emission, for both the young and old stellar populations. Ongoing star-formation activity is found in 47{\%} of ETGs and 8{\%} of LTGs are quiescent. The star-forming E galaxies, together with the LBSs, constitute a population that follows very well the SFMS of spiral galaxies. The fraction of the luminosity originating from young stars in the star-forming ETGs is quite substantial ({\$}\backslashsim{\$} 25{\%}) and similar to that of the star-forming LTGs. Investigating possible differences between star-forming and quiescent galaxies we find that the intrinsic shape of the SED of the star-forming galaxies is, on average, very similar for all morphological types. Concerning their structural parameters, quiescent galaxies tend to show larger values of the S$\backslash$'ersic index and larger {\$}R{\_}\backslashtext{\{}eff{\}}{\$} (compared to star-forming galaxies). Finally, we find that star-forming galaxies preferably reside in lower-density environments compared to the quiescent ones, which exhibit a higher percentage of sources being members of groups.},

These recently quenched galaxies, usually referred to as post-starburst galaxies, span a wide range of colors and we find a clear correlation between color and half-light radius, such that bluer galaxies are smaller. We build simple toy models to explain this correlation: a normal star-forming disk plus a central, compact starburst component. Bursts with exponential decay timescale of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}{\~{}}100 Myr that produce {\$}\backslashsim10\backslash{\%}{\$} to more than 100$\backslash${\%} of the pre-existing masses can reproduce the observed correlation. More significant bursts also produce bluer and smaller descendants. Our findings imply that when galaxies shut down star formation rapidly, they generally had experienced compact, starburst events and that the large, observed spread in sizes and colors mostly reflects a variety of burst strengths. Recently quenched galaxies should have younger stellar ages in the centers; multi-wavelength data with high spatial resolution are required to reveal the age gradient. Highly dissipative processes should be responsible for this type of formation history. While determining the mechanisms for individual galaxies is challenging, some recently quenched galaxies show signs of gravitational interactions, suggesting that mergers are likely an important mechanism in triggering the rapid shut-down of star-formation activities at {\$}z\backslashsim0.8{\$}.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of the host properties of 85224 emission-line galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We show that Seyferts and LINERs form clearly separated branches on the standard optical diagnostic diagrams. We derive a new empirical classification scheme which cleanly separates star-forming galaxies, composite AGN-HII galaxies, Seyferts and LINERs and we study the host galaxy properties of these different classes of objects. LINERs are older, more massive, less dusty and more concentrated, and have higher velocity dispersions and lower [OIII] luminosities than Seyfert galaxies. We consider the quantity L[OIII]/sigma{\^{}}4, which is an indicator of the black hole accretion rate relative to the Eddington rate. Remarkably, we find that at fixed L[OIII]/sigma{\^{}}4, all differences between Seyfert and LINER host properties disappear. LINERs and Seyferts form a continuous sequence, with LINERs dominant at low L/L(EDD) and Seyferts dominant at high L/L(EDD). These results suggest that the majority of LINERs are AGN and that the Seyfert/LINER dichotomy is analogous to the high/low-state transition for X-ray binary systems. We apply theoretical photoionization models and show that pure LINERs require a harder ionizing radiation field with lower ionization parameter than Seyfert galaxies, consistent with the low and high X-ray binary states.},

abstract = {We use cosmological simulations to study a characteristic evolution pattern of high redshift galaxies. Early, stream-fed, highly perturbed, gas-rich discs undergo phases of dissipative contraction into compact, star-forming systems (blue nuggets) at z{\~{}}4-2. The peak of gas compaction marks the onset of central gas depletion and inside-out quenching into compact ellipticals (red nuggets) by z{\~{}}2. These are sometimes surrounded by gas rings or grow extended dry stellar envelopes. The compaction occurs at a roughly constant specific star-formation rate (SFR), and the quenching occurs at a constant stellar surface density within the inner kpc ({\$}\backslashSigma{\_}1{\$}). Massive galaxies quench earlier, faster, and at a higher {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}1{\$} than lower-mass galaxies, which compactify and attempt to quench more than once. This evolution pattern is consistent with the way galaxies populate the SFR-radius-mass space, and with gradients and scatter across the main sequence. The compaction is triggered by an intense inflow episode, involving (mostly minor) mergers, counter-rotating streams or recycled gas, and is commonly associated with violent disc instability. The contraction is dissipative, with the inflow rate {\textgreater}SFR, and the maximum {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}1{\$} anti-correlated with the initial spin parameter, as predicted by Dekel {\&} Burkert (2014). The central quenching is triggered by the high SFR and stellar/supernova feedback (possibly also AGN feedback) due to the high central gas density, while the central inflow weakens as the disc vanishes. Suppression of fresh gas supply by a hot halo allows the long-term maintenance of quenching once above a threshold halo mass, inducing the quenching downsizing.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {We present far-infrared (FIR) photometry at 150 and 205 $\mu$m of eight low-redshift starburst galaxies obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) ISOPHOT. Five of the eight galaxies are detected in both wave bands, and these data are used, in conjunction with IRAS archival photometry, to model the dust emission at $\lambda${\textgreater}{\~{}}40 $\mu$m. The FIR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) are best fitted by a combination of two modified Planck functions, with T{\~{}}40-55 K (warm dust) and T{\~{}}20-23 K (cool dust) and with a dust emissivity index ɛ=2. The cool dust can be a major contributor to the FIR emission of starburst galaxies, representing up to 60{\%} of the total flux. This component is heated not only by the general interstellar radiation field, but also by the starburst itself. The cool dust mass is up to {\~{}}150 times larger than the warm dust mass, bringing the gas-to-dust ratios of the starbursts in our sample close to Milky Way values, once rescaled for the appropriate metallicity. The ratio between the total dust FIR emission in the range 1-1000 $\mu$m and the IRAS FIR emission in the range 40-120 $\mu$m is {\~{}}1.75, with small variations from galaxy to galaxy. This ratio is about 40{\%} larger than previously inferred from data at millimeter wavelengths. Although the galaxies in our sample are generally classified as ``UV bright,'' for four of them the UV energy emerging shortward of 0.2 $\mu$m is less than 15{\%} of the FIR energy. On average, about 30{\%} of the bolometric flux is coming out in the UV-to-near-IR wavelength range; the rest is emitted in the FIR. Energy balance calculations show that the FIR emission predicted by the dust reddening of the UV-to-near-IR stellar emission is within a factor of {\~{}}2 of the observed value in individual galaxies and within 20{\%} when averaged over a large sample. If our sample of local starbursts is representative of high-redshift (z{\textgreater}{\~{}}1), UV-bright, star-forming galaxies, these galaxies' FIR emission will be generally undetected in submillimeter surveys, unless (1) their bolometric luminosity is comparable to or larger than that of ultraluminous FIR galaxies and (2) their FIR SED contains a cool dust component.

abstract = {The Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis suite of binary stellar evolution models and synthetic stellar populations provides a framework for the physically motivated analysis of both the integrated light from distant stellar populations and the detailed properties of those nearby. We present a new version 2.1 data release of these models, detailing the methodology by which Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis incorporates binary mass transfer and its effect on stellar evolution pathways, as well as the construction of simple stellar populations. We demonstrate key tests of the latest Binary Population and Spectral Synthesis model suite demonstrating its ability to reproduce the colours and derived properties of resolved stellar populations, including well-constrained eclipsing binaries. We consider observational constraints on the ratio of massive star types and the distribution of stellar remnant masses. We describe the identification of supernova progenitors in our models, and demonstrate a good agreement to the properties of observed progenitors. We also test our models against photometric and spectroscopic observations of unresolved stellar populations, both in the local and distant Universe, finding that binary models provide a self-consistent explanation for observed galaxy properties across a broad redshift range. Finally, we carefully describe the limitations of our models, and areas where we expect to see significant improvement in future versions.},

abstract = {Context. Deep representative surveys of galaxies at different epochs are needed to make progress in understanding galaxy evolution. Aims. We describe the completed VIMOS VLT Deep Survey and the final data release of 35 016 galaxies and type-I AGN with measured spectroscopic redshifts covering all epochs up to redshift z ∼ 6.7, in areas from 0.142 to 8.7 square degrees, and volumes from 0.5×106 to 2×107 h-3 Mpc 3. Methods. We selected samples of galaxies based solely on their i-band magnitude reaching iAB = 24.75. Spectra were obtained with VIMOS on the ESO-VLT integrating 0.75 h, 4.5 h, and 18 h for the Wide, Deep, and Ultra-Deep nested surveys, respectively. We demonstrate that any "redshift desert" can be crossed successfully using spectra covering 3650 ≤ $\lambda$ ≤ 9350 A. A total of 1263 galaxies were again observed independently within the VVDS and from the VIPERS and MASSIV surveys. They were used to establish the redshift measurements reliability, to assess completeness in the VVDS sample, and to provide a weighting scheme taking the survey selection function into account. We describe the main properties of the VVDS samples, and the VVDS is compared to other spectroscopic surveys in the literature. Results. In total we have obtained spectroscopic redshifts for 34 594 galaxies, 422 type-I AGN, and 12 430 Galactic stars. The survey enabled identifying galaxies up to very high redshifts with 4669 redshifts in 1 ≤ zspec ≤ 2, 561 in 2 ≤ zspec ≤ 3, and 468 with zspec {\textgreater} 3, and specific populations like Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters were identified out to z = 6.62.We show that the VVDS occupies a unique place in the parameter space defined by area, depth, redshift coverage, and number of spectra. Conclusions. The VIMOS VLT Deep Survey provides a comprehensive survey of the distant universe, covering all epochs since z ∼ 6, or more than 12 Gyr of cosmic time, with a uniform selection, which is the largest such sample to date. A wealth of science results derived from the VVDS have shed new light on the evolution of galaxies and AGN and on their distribution in space over this large cosmic time. The VVDS further demonstrates that large deep spectroscopic redshift surveys over all these epochs in the distant Universe are a key tool to observational cosmology. To enhance the legacy value of the survey, a final public release of the complete VVDS spectroscopic redshift sample is available at http://cesam.lam.fr/vvds. {\textcopyright} 2013 ESO.},

abstract = {This paper describes new deep 3.6 and 4.5 micron imaging of three UltraVISTA near-infrared survey stripes within the COSMOS field. The observations were carried out with Spitzer's Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) for the Spitzer Matching Survey of the Ultra-VISTA Deep Stripes (SMUVS). In this work we present our data reduction techniques, and document the resulting mosaics, coverage maps, and catalogs in both IRAC passbands for the three easternmost UltraVISTA survey stripes, covering a combined area of about 0.66 square degrees, of which 0.45 square degrees have at least 20 hr integration time. SMUVS reaches point-source sensitivities of about 25.0 AB mag at both 3.6 and 4.5 microns with a significance of 4-sigma accounting for both survey sensitivity and source confusion. To this limit the SMUVS catalogs contain a total of about 350,000 sources, each of which is detected significantly in at least one IRAC band. Because of its uniform and high sensitivity, relatively large area coverage, and the wide array of ancillary data available in COSMOS, the SMUVS survey will be useful for a large number of cosmological investigations. We will make all images and catalogues described herein publicly available via the Spitzer Science Center.},

@article{Bullock2010,
abstract = {We predict that there is a population of low-luminosity dwarf galaxies orbiting within the halo of the Milky Way that have surface brightnesses low enough to have escaped detection in star-count surveys. The overall count of stealth galaxies is sensitive to the presence (or lack) of a low-mass threshold in galaxy formation. These systems have luminosities and stellar velocity dispersions that are similar to those of known ultrafaint dwarf galaxies but they have more extended stellar distributions (half light radii greater than about 100 pc) because they inhabit dark subhalos that are slightly less massive than their higher surface brightness counterparts. As a result, the typical peak surface brightness is fainter than 30 mag per square arcsec. One implication is that the inferred common mass scale for Milky Way dwarfs may be an artifact of selection bias. If there is no sharp threshold in galaxy formation at low halo mass, then ultrafaint galaxies like Segue 1 represent the high-mass, early forming tail of a much larger population of objects that could number in the hundreds and have typical peak circular velocities of about 8 km/s and masses within 300 pc of about 5 million solar masses. Alternatively, if we impose a low-mass threshold in galaxy formation in order to explain the unexpectedly high densities of the ultrafaint dwarfs, then we expect only a handful of stealth galaxies in the halo of the Milky Way. A complete census of these objects will require deeper sky surveys, 30m-class follow-up telescopes, and more refined methods to identify extended, self-bound groupings of stars in the halo.},

abstract = {We investigate the optical and Wide-field Survey Explorer (WISE) colors of "E+A" identified poststarburst galaxies, including a deep analysis on 190 poststarbursts detected in the 2MASS Extended Source Catalog. The poststarburst galaxies appear in both the optical green valley and the WISE Infrared Transition Zone (IRTZ). Furthermore, we find that poststarbursts occupy a distinct region [3.4]-[4.6] vs. [4.6]-[12] WISE colors, enabling the identification of this class of transitioning galaxies through the use of broad band photometric criteria alone. We have investigated possible causes for the WISE colors of poststarbursts by constructing a composite spectral energy distribution (SED), finding that mid-infrared (4--12$\backslash$micron) properties of poststarbursts are consistent with either 11.3um polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon emission, or Thermally Pulsating Asymptotic Giant Branch (TP-AGB) and post-AGB stars. The composite SED of extended poststarburst galaxies with 22um emission detected with signal to noise {\textgreater}3 requires a hot dust component to produce their observed 22um emission, consistent with the presence of an AGN. The composite SED of WISE 22um non-detections (S/N{\textless}3) was created by stacking 22um images and is also consistent with an AGN contribution. Given that the E+A selection selects against AGNs, the non-negligible number of AGNs found in this sample should cause us to reconsider the relative importance of the presence of an AGN in transitioning galaxies.},

We subsequently measure the angular correlation function and bias in different stellar mass and luminosity bins. We focus on comparing the clustering dependence on these two properties. While UV-luminosity is only related to recent starbursts of a galaxy, stellar mass reflects the integrated build-up of the whole star formation history, which should make it more tightly correlated with halo mass. Hence, the clustering segregation with stellar mass is expected to be larger than with luminosity. However, our measurements suggest that the segregation with luminosity is larger with {\$}\backslashsimeq 90\backslash{\%}{\$} confidence (neglecting contributions from systematic errors). We compare this unexpected result with predictions from the $\backslash$textsc{\{}Meraxes{\}} semi-analytic galaxy formation model. Interestingly, the model reproduces the observed angular correlation functions, and also suggests stronger clustering segregation with luminosity. The comparison between our observations and the model provides evidence of multiple halo occupation in the small scale clustering.},

Particularly accurate relative distances are compiled and homogenized a) for 246 SNe Ia and 35 clusters with v{\textless}30,000 km/s, and b) for relatively nearby galaxies with 176 TRGB and 30 Cepheid distances. The 487 objects define a tight Hubble diagram from 300-30,000 km/s implying individual distance errors of {\textless}7.5{\%}. Here the velocities are corrected for Virgocentric steaming (locally 220 km/s) and - if v{\_}220{\textgreater}3500 km/s - for a 495 km/s motion of the Local Supercluster towards the warm CMB pole at l=275, b=12; local peculiar motions are averaged out by large numbers. A test for linear expansion shows that the corrected velocities increase with distance as predicted by a standard model with q{\_}0=-0.55 [corresponding to (Omega{\_}M, Omega{\_}Lambda)=(0.3,0.7)], but the same holds - due to the distance limitation of the present sample - for a range of models with q{\_}0 between {\~{}}0.00 and -1.00. For these models H{\_}0 does not vary systematically by more than +/-2.3{\%} over the entire range. Local, distance-dependent variations are equally limited to 2.3{\%} on average. In particular the proposed Hubble Bubble of Zehavi et al. and Jha et al. is rejected at the 4sigma level. - Velocity residuals in function of the angle from the CMB pole yield a satisfactory apex velocity of 448+/-73 km/s and a coherence radius of the Local Supercluster of {\~{}}3500 km/s ({\~{}}56 Mpc), beyond which galaxies are seen on average at rest in co-moving coordinates with respect to the CMB. Since no obvious single accelerator of the Local Supercluster exists in the direction of the CMB dipole its motion must be due to the integral gravitational force of all surrounding structures. Most of the gravitational dipole comes probably from within 5000 km/s.},

abstract = {The atmospheric composition of transiting exoplanets can be characterized during transit by spectroscopy. For an Earth twin, models predict that oxygen and ozone biogenic gases should be detectable, as well as water vapour, a molecule linked to habitability as we know it on Earth. The aim is to measure the Earth radius versus wavelength at the highest spectral resolution available to fully characterize the signature of the Earth seen as a transiting exoplanet. We present observations of Dec. 21, 2010 Moon eclipse. The Earth observed from the Moon during a lunar eclipse transits in front of the Sun and opens access to the Earth atmosphere transmission spectrum. We used two different ESO spectrographs to take penumbra and umbra high-resolution spectra from 3100 to 10400$\backslash$AA. A change in moisture above the telescope compromised the UVES data. We explain how we correct this effect. The data are analyzed by three different methods, the first method being the method described in Vidal-Madjar et al. 2010 based on the analysis of pairs of penumbra spectra. The second makes use of a single penumbra spectrum, and the third of all penumbra and umbra spectra. Profiles are obtained with the three methods for both instruments. The first method gives the best result, in agreement with a model. The second method seems more sensitive to the Doppler shift of solar spectral lines with respect to the telluric lines. The third method makes use of umbra spectra that bias the result by increasing the overall negative slope of the profile. It can be corrected a posteriori from results with the first method. The three methods clearly show the spectral signature of the Rayleigh scattering in the Earth atmosphere and the bands of H2O, O2 and O3. Sodium is detected. Finally we show that the E-ELT will be able to detect the O2 A-band, and O3 and water vapour to a lesser extent, for an Earth twin at 10pc.},

abstract = {The deep, near-infrared narrow-band survey HiZELS has yielded robust samples of H-alpha emitting star-forming galaxies within narrow redshift slices at z = 0.8, 1.47 and 2.23. In this paper, we distinguish the stellar mass and star-formation rate (SFR) dependence of the clustering of these galaxies. At high stellar masses (M/M{\_}sol{\textgreater}2x10{\^{}}10), where HiZELS selects galaxies close to the so-called star-forming main sequence, the clustering strength is observed to increase strongly with stellar mass (in line with the results of previous studies of mass-selected galaxy samples) and also with SFR. These two dependencies are shown to hold independently. At lower stellar masses, however, where HiZELS probes high specific SFR galaxies, there is little or no dependence of the clustering strength on stellar mass, but the dependence on SFR remains: high-SFR low-mass galaxies are found in more massive dark matter haloes than their lower SFR counterparts. We argue that this is due to environmentally driven star formation in these systems. We apply the same selection criteria to the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations. We find that, in EAGLE, the high-SFR low-mass galaxies are central galaxies in more massive dark matter haloes, in which the high SFRs are driven by a (halo-driven) increased gas content.},

Using Keck/MOSFIRE, we measure 49 redshifts for galaxies brighter than Ks=25 mag as part of our Multi-Object Spectroscopic Emission Line (MOSEL) survey. Our spectroscopic success rate is {\~{}}53{\%} and zphot uncertainty is sigma{\_}z= [Delta(z)/(1+z)]=0.0135. We confirm 31 ELGs at 3{\textless}zspec{\textless}3.8 and show that Strong ELGs have spectroscopic rest-frame [OIII]5007A equivalent widths of 100-500A and tend to be lower mass systems [log(Mstar/Msun){\~{}}8.2-9.6] compared to more typical star-forming galaxies. The Strong ELGs lie {\~{}}0.9 dex above the star-forming main-sequence at z{\~{}}3.5 and have high inferred gas fractions of fgas{\~{}}{\textgreater}60{\%}, i.e. the inferred gas masses can easily fuel a starburst to double stellar masses within {\~{}}10-100 Myr. Combined with recent results using ZFOURGE, our analysis indicates that 1) strong [OIII]5007A emission signals an early episode of intense stellar growth in low mass (Mstar{\textless}0.1M*) galaxies and 2) many, if not most, galaxies at z{\textgreater}3 go through this starburst phase. If true, low-mass galaxies with strong [OIII]5007A emission (EW{\_}rest{\textgreater}200A) may be an increasingly important source of ionizing UV radiation at z{\textgreater}3.},

abstract = {We report observations with the Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) of six submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) within 3 arcmin of the Distant Red Core (DRC) at {\$}z=4.0{\$}, a site of intense cluster-scale star formation, first reported by Oteo et al. (2018). We find new members of DRC in three SMG fields; in two fields, the SMGs are shown to lie along the line of sight towards DRC; one SMG is spurious. Although at first sight this rate of association is consistent with earlier predictions, associations with the bright SMGs are rarer than expected, which suggests caution when interpreting continuum over-densities. We consider the implications of all 14 confirmed DRC components passing simultaneously through an active phase of star formation. In the simplest explanation, we see only the tip of the iceberg in terms of star formation and gas available for future star formation, consistent with our remarkable finding that the majority of newly confirmed DRC galaxies are not the brightest continuum emitters in their immediate vicinity. Thus while ALMA continuum follow-up of SMGs identifies the brightest continuum emitters in each field, it does not necessarily reveal all the gas-rich galaxies. To hunt effectively for protocluster members requires wide and deep spectral-line imaging to uncover any relatively continuum-faint galaxies that are rich in atomic or molecular gas. Searching with short-baseline arrays or single-dish facilities, the true scale of the underlying gas reservoirs may be revealed.},

abstract = {Observations have revealed log M*/Msun {\textgreater}11 galaxies that were already dead when the universe was only {\~{}}2Gyr.

In this paper, we study star formation and metallicity enrichment histories of 24 massive galaxies at 1.6{\textless}z{\textless}2.5. A deep slitless spectroscopy + imaging data set collected from multiple HST surveys allows robust determination of their SEDs. Our new SED modeling provides mass accumulation/stellar metallicity enrichment histories of those galaxies over the past {\~{}}3Gyr, with no functional assumptions on their star formation histories. We find that most of our massive galaxies have formed {\textgreater}50{\%} of their extant masses by {\~{}}1.5Gyr before the time of observed redshifts, with a trend where more massive galaxies form earlier. Most of our galaxies already have stellar metallicities compatible with, or even higher than, those of local early-type galaxies, with a median value of log Z*/Zsun=0.25 and scatter of {\~{}}0.15dex. By using reconstructed star formation history, we reveal their rapid metallicity enrichment history from z{\~{}}5.5 to 2.2 at a rate of {\~{}}0.2dex/Gyr in logZ*/Zsun. The inferred metallicities are on average {\~{}}0.25dex higher than observed gas-phase metallicities of star forming galaxies at the time of formation. This supports a view where quenched galaxies continue to form stars at low-level until recently, rather than abrupt termination of star formation activity.},

We explore three DM halo models (unperturbed Navarro, Frenk, and White (NFW) halos and the adiabatic contraction models of Blumenthal and Gnedin) and impose a model for the relationship between the stellar and virial mass (i.e., a relationship for the star formation efficiency as a function of halo mass). We show that, given our model assumptions, the data clearly prefer a Salpeter-like initial mass function (IMF) over a lighter IMF (e.g., Chabrier or Kroupa), irrespective of the choice of DM halo. In addition, we find that the data prefer at most a moderate amount of adiabatic contraction (Blumenthal adiabatic contraction is strongly disfavored) and are only consistent with no adiabatic contraction (i.e., an NFW halo) if a mass-dependent IMF is assumed, in the sense of a more massive normalization of the IMF for more massive halos. {\textcopyright} 2010.

We compare our cleaning procedure with the foreground modeling used by the Planck team and find good agreement.

We show evidence suggesting residual systematics in the detector set spectra used in the Planck likelihood code, which is substantially reduced for our spectra.},

These observations ultimately confirm the redshift, making AzTEC-3 the most submillimeter-luminous galaxy in a massive z {\~{}}= 5.3 protocluster structure in the COSMOS field. The strength of the CO line emission reveals a large molecular gas reservoir with a mass of 5.3 × 1010($\alpha$CO/0.8) M sun, which can maintain the intense 1800 M sun yr-1 starburst in this system for at least 30 Myr, increasing the stellar mass by up to a factor of six in the process. This gas mass is comparable to "typical" z {\~{}} 2 SMGs and constitutes gsim80{\%} of the baryonic mass (gas+stars) and 30{\%}-80{\%} of the total (dynamical) mass in this galaxy. The molecular gas reservoir has a radius of {\textless}4 kpc and likely consists of a "diffuse", low-excitation component, containing (at least) 1/3 of the gas mass (depending on the relative conversion factor $\alpha$CO), and a "dense", high-excitation component, containing {\~{}}2/3 of the mass. The likely presence of a substantial diffuse component besides highly excited gas suggests different properties between the star-forming environments in z {\textgreater} 4 SMGs and z {\textgreater} 4 quasar host galaxies, which perhaps trace different evolutionary stages. The discovery of a massive, metal-enriched gas reservoir in an SMG at the heart of a large z = 5.3 protocluster considerably enhances our understanding of early massive galaxy formation, pushing back to a cosmic epoch where the universe was less than 1/12 of its present age.},

However, most of them have been found through the overdensity of star-forming galaxies, and there have been no known structures identified by more than two spectroscopically confirmed quiescent galaxies at z {\textgreater} 2.5. In this letter, we report the discovery of an overdense structure of massive quiescent galaxies with the spectroscopic redshift z = 2.77 in the COSMOS field, QO-1000. We first photometrically identify this structure as a 4.2 $\sigma$ overdensity with 14 quiescent galaxies in 7 × 4 pMpc 2 from the COSMOS2020 catalog. We then securely confirm the spectroscopic redshifts of four quiescent galaxies by detecting multiple Balmer absorption lines with Keck/MOSFIRE. All the spectroscopically confirmed members are massive ( log ( M ⋆ / M ⊙ ) {\textgreater} 11.0 ) and located in a narrow redshift range (2.76 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.79). Moreover, three of them are in the 1 × 1 pMpc 2 in the transverse direction at the same redshift ( z = 2.760–2.763). Such a concentration of four spectroscopically confirmed quiescent galaxies implies that QO-1000 is {\textgreater}68 times denser than the general field. In addition, we confirm that they form a red sequence in the J − K s color. This structure's halo mass is estimated as log ( M halo / M ⊙ ) {\textgreater} 13.2 from its stellar mass. Similar structures found in the IllustrisTNG simulation are expected to evolve into massive galaxy clusters with log ( M halo / M ⊙ ) ≥ 14.8 at z = 0. These results suggest that QO-1000 is a more mature protocluster than the other known protoclusters. It is likely in a transition phase between star-forming protoclusters and quenched galaxy clusters.},

abstract = {The Star Formation Rate (SFR) is one of the main parameters used to analyze the evolution of galaxies through time. The need for recovering the light reprocessed by dust commonly requires the use of low spatial resolution far-infrared data. Recombination-line luminosities provide an alternative, although uncertain dust-extinction corrections based on narrow-band imaging or long-slit spectroscopy have traditionally posed a limit to their applicability. Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) is clearly the way to overcome such limitation. We obtain integrated H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}, ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR)-based SFR measurements for 272 galaxies from the CALIFA survey at 0.005 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.03 using single-band and hybrid tracers. We provide updated calibrations, both global and split by properties (including stellar mass and morphological type), referred to H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}. The extinction-corrected H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} luminosity agrees with the updated hybrid SFR estimators based on either UV or H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} plus IR luminosity over the full range of SFRs (0.03-20 M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} yr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}). The coefficient that weights the amount of energy produced by newly-born stars that is reprocessed by dust on the hybrid tracers, a{\$}{\_}{\{}IR{\}}{\$}, shows a large dispersion. However, it does not became increasingly small at high attenuations, as expected if significant highly-obscured H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emission would be missed. Lenticulars, early-type spirals and type-2 AGN host galaxies show smaller coefficients due to the contribution of optical photons and AGN to dust heating. In the Local Universe the H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} luminosity derived from IFS observations can be used to measure SFR, at least in statistically-significant, optically-selected galaxy samples. The analysis of the SFR calibrations by galaxies properties could be potentially used by other works to study the impact of different selection criteria in the SFR values derived.},

They undoubtedly play a key role in early massive galaxy evolution and they may host the earliest sites of galaxy quenching or even induce extreme states of star formation. Studying protoclusters therefore not only gives us a window into distant galaxy formation but also provides an important link in our understanding of how dense structures grow over time and modify the galaxies within them. Current protocluster samples are completely unable to address these points because they are small and selected in a heterogeneous way. We propose the Roman-Cosmic Noon survey, whose centerpiece is an extremely deep (30ksec) and wide area (10 deg{\$}{\^{}}2{\$}) prism slitless spectroscopy survey to identify the full range of galaxy structures at {\$}2{\textless}z{\textless}3{\$}. This survey will include 1500 uniformly selected protoclusters, their surrounding cosmic web environments, and at least 15,000 protocluster galaxies with {\$}M{\_}\backslashstar{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}10.5{\}} {\{}\backslashrm M{\}}{\_}\backslashodot{\$} across the full range of star formation histories as well as many more lower mass star-forming galaxies. The survey will also contain field galaxies to much lower masses than in the High Latitude Wide Area Survey, but over an area dwarfing any current or planned deep spectroscopy probe at {\$}z{\textgreater}2{\$}. With the prism spectroscopy and some modest additional imaging this survey will measure precise stellar mass functions, quenched fractions, galaxy and protocluster morphologies, stellar ages, emission-line based SFRs, and metallicities. It will have extensive legacy value well beyond the key protocluster science goals.},

The sample is selected from galaxies in the All-Wavelength Extended Groth Strip International Survey (AEGIS). While the green valley is defined using optical U - B colors, we find that using a green valley sample defined using NUV - R colors does not change the results. Using Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging, we study several quantitative morphological parameters including CAS, B/T from GIM2D, and Gini/M 20. We find that the green galaxy population is intermediate between the red and blue galaxy populations in terms of concentration, asymmetry, and morphological type and merger fraction estimated using Gini/M 20. We find that most green galaxies are not classified as mergers; in fact, the merger fraction in the green valley is lower than in the blue cloud. We show that at a given stellar mass, green galaxies have higher concentration values than blue galaxies and lower concentration values than red galaxies. Additionally, we find that 12{\%} of green galaxies have B/T = 0 and 21{\%} have B/T {\textless}= 0.05. Our results show that green galaxies are generally massive (M * {\~{}} 1010.5 M sun) disk galaxies with high concentrations. We conclude that major mergers are likely not the sole mechanism responsible for quenching star formation in this population and that either other external processes or internal secular processes play an important role both in driving gas toward the center of these galaxies and in quenching star formation.},

abstract = {We have used extensive libraries of model and empirical galaxy spectra [assembled, respectively, from the population synthesis code of Bruzual and Charlot and the fourth data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)] to interpret some puzzling features seen in the spectra of high-redshift star-forming galaxies. We show that a stellar HeII$\lambda$1640 emission line, produced in the expanding atmospheres of Of and Wolf-Rayet stars, should be detectable with an equivalent width of 0.5-1.5{\AA} in the integrated spectra of star-forming galaxies, provided the metallicity is greater than about half solar. Our models reproduce the strength of the HeII$\lambda$1640 line measured in the spectra of Lyman-break galaxies for established values of their metallicities. With better empirical calibrations in local galaxies, this spectral feature has the potential of becoming a useful diagnostic of massive star winds at high, as well as low redshifts. We also uncover a relationship in SDSS galaxies between their location in the [OIII]/H$\beta$ versus [NII]/H$\alpha$ diagnostic diagram (the BPT diagram) and their excess specific star formation rate relative to galaxies of similar mass. We infer that an elevated ionization parameter U is at the root of this effect, and propose that this is also the cause of the offset of high-redshift star-forming galaxies in the BPT diagram compared to local ones. We further speculate that higher electron densities and escape fractions of hydrogen ionizing photons may be the factors responsible for the systematically higher values of U in the HII regions of high-redshift galaxies. The impact of such differences on abundance determinations from strong nebular lines are considered and found to be relatively minor.},

Here we present James Webb Space Telescope ($\backslash$JWST) Near Infrared Camera (NIRCam) images of Earendel in 8 filters spanning 0.8--5.0{\$}\backslashmu{\$}m. In these higher resolution images, Earendel remains a single unresolved point source on the lensing critical curve, increasing the lower limit on the lensing magnification to {\$}\backslashmu {\textgreater} 4000{\$} and restricting the source plane radius further to {\$}r {\textless} 0.02{\$} pc, or {\$}\backslashsim 4000{\$} AU. These new observations strengthen the conclusion that Earendel is best explained by an individual star or multiple star system. The new imaging also supports the previous photometric redshift estimate, solidifying the interpretation of Earendel as a stellar source within the first billion years of the universe. Fitting stellar spectra to our photometry yields a stellar temperature of {\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}eff{\}}{\}} \backslashsimeq 13000{\$}--16000 K assuming the light is dominated by a single star. The delensed bolometric luminosity in this case ranges from {\$}\backslashlog(L) = 5.8{\$}--6.6 {\$}L{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, which is in the range where one expects luminous blue variable stars. Allowing for two stars with different temperatures can yield better fits to the photometry at the expense of increased free parameters, leading to non-unique well-fitting temperatures of {\$}T{\_}{\{}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}}{\}} \backslashgtrsim 20000{\$} K and {\$}T{\_}{\{}{\{}\backslashrm eff{\}}{\}} \backslashlesssim 13000{\$} K for the hotter and cooler components, respectively.

The majority (9/17) of cluster HDSGs show evidence for star formation at their centers, with the HDS regions found in the outer parts of the galaxy. Conversely, the {\$}\backslashrm{\{}H{\}}{\{}\backslashdelta{\}}{\$}-strong signal is more evenly spread across the galaxy for the majority (6/8) of HDSGs in low-density environments, and is often associated with emission lines that are not due to star formation. We investigate the location of the HDSGs in the clusters, finding that they are exclusively within 0.6{\$}R{\_}{\{}200{\}}{\$} of the cluster centre, and have a significantly higher velocity dispersion relative to the cluster population. Comparing their distribution in projected-phase-space to those derived from cosmological simulations indicates that the cluster HDSGs are consistent with an infalling population that have entered the central 0.5{\$}r{\_}{\{}200, 3D{\}}{\$} cluster region within the last {\$}\backslashsim 1\backslash,{\$}Gyr. In the 8/9 cluster HDSGs with central star formation, the extent of star formation is consistent with that expected of outside-in quenching by ram-pressure stripping.

abstract = {We investigate the correlations between the peak intrinsic colors of Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) and their expansion velocities at maximum light, measured from the Si II 6355 A spectral feature. We construct a new hierarchical Bayesian regression model and Gibbs sampler to estimate the statistical dependence of the intrinsic colors of a SN Ia on its ejecta velocity, while accounting for the random effects of intrinsic scatter, measurement error, and reddening by host galaxy dust. The method is applied to the apparent color data from BVRI light curves and Si II velocity data for 79 nearby SN Ia. Comparison of the apparent color distributions of high velocity (HV) and normal velocity (NV) supernovae reveals significant discrepancies in B-V and B-R, but not other colors. Hence, they are likely due to intrinsic color differences originating in the B-band, rather than dust reddening. The mean intrinsic B-V and B-R color differences between HV and NV groups are 0.06 +/- 0.02 and 0.09 +/- 0.02 mag, respectively. Under a linear model for intrinsic B-V and B-R colors versus velocity, we find significant slopes of -0.021 +/- 0.006 and -0.030 +/- 0.009 mag/(1000 km/s), respectively. Since the ejecta velocity distribution is skewed towards high velocities, these effects imply non-Gaussian intrinsic color population distributions with skewness up to +0.3. Accounting for the intrinsic color-velocity correlation results in corrections in A{\_}V extinction estimates as large as -0.12 mag for HV SN Ia and +0.06 mag for NV events. Deviance information criteria strongly favor simple functions for intrinsic colors versus velocity over no trend, while higher-order polynomials are disfavored. Velocity measurements from SN Ia spectra have potential to diminish systematic errors from the confounding of intrinsic colors and dust reddening affecting supernova distances.},

abstract = {We provide a systematic measurement of the rest-frame UV continuum slope beta over a wide range in redshift (z{\~{}}2-6) and rest-frame UV luminosity (0.1-2L*) to improve estimates of the SFR density at high redshift. We utilize the deep optical and infrared data (ACS/NICMOS) over the CDF-S and HDF-N GOODS fields, as well as the UDF for our primary UBVi "dropout" sample. We correct the observed distributions for selection biases and photometric scatter. We find that the UV-continuum slope of the most luminous galaxies is substantially redder at z{\~{}}2-4 than it is at z{\~{}}5-6. Lower luminosity galaxies are also found to be bluer than higher luminosity galaxies at z{\~{}}2.5 and z{\~{}}4. We do not find a large number of galaxies with beta's as red as -1 in our dropout selections at z{\~{}}4, and particularly at z{\textgreater}{\~{}}5, even though such sources could be readily selected from our data. This suggests that star-forming galaxies at z{\textgreater}{\~{}}5 almost universally have very blue UV-continuum slopes, and that there are not likely to be a substantial number of dust-obscured galaxies at z{\textgreater}{\~{}}5 that are missed in "dropout" searches. Using the same relation between UV-continuum slope and dust extinction as found to be appropriate at z{\~{}}0 and z{\~{}}2, we estimate the average dust extinction of galaxies as a function of redshift and UV luminosity in a consistent way. We find that the estimated dust extinction increases substantially with cosmic time for the most UV luminous galaxies, but remains small ({\textless}{\~{}}2x) at all times for lower luminosity galaxies. Because these same lower luminosity galaxies dominate the luminosity density in the UV, the overall dust extinction correction remains modest at all redshifts. We include the contribution from ULIRGs in our SFR density estimates at z{\~{}}2-6, but find that they contribute only {\~{}}20{\%} of the total at z{\~{}}2.5 and {\textless}{\~{}}10{\%} at z{\textgreater}{\~{}}4.},

abstract = {We report the detection of 23 OH+(1-0) absorption, emission, or P-Cygni-shaped lines and CO(9-8) emission lines in 18 Herschel-selected z=2-6 starburst galaxies with ALMA and NOEMA, taken as part of the Gas And Dust Over cosmic Time (GADOT) Galaxy Survey. We find that the CO(9-8) luminosity is higher than expected based on the far-infrared luminosity when compared to nearby star-forming galaxies. Together with the strength of the OH+ emission components, this may suggest that shock excitation of warm, dense molecular gas is more prevalent in distant massive dusty starbursts than in nearby star-forming galaxies on average, perhaps due to an impact of galactic winds on the gas. OH+ absorption is found to be ubiquitous in massive high-redshift starbursts, and is detected toward 89{\%} of the sample. The majority of the sample shows evidence for outflows or inflows based on the velocity shifts of the OH+ absorption/emission, with a comparable occurrence rate of both at the resolution of our observations. A small subsample appears to show outflow velocities in excess of their escape velocities. Thus, starburst-driven feedback appears to be important in the evolution of massive galaxies in their most active phases. We find a correlation between the OH+ absorption optical depth and the dust temperature, which may suggest that warmer starbursts are more compact and have higher cosmic ray energy densities, leading to more efficient OH+ ion production. This is in agreement with a picture in which these high-redshift galaxies are "scaled-up" versions of the most intense nearby starbursts.},

We also see evidence for number density downsizing, such that the galaxies selected at the lowest densities (highest masses) become a homogeneous red population before those at higher number densities. Examining the evolution of the colours for these systems furthermore shows that the formation redshift of galaxies selected at these number densities is {\$}z{\_}{\{}\backslashrm form{\}}{\textgreater}3{\$}. The structural evolution through size and Sersic index fits reveal that while there remains evolution in terms of galaxies becoming larger and more concentrated in stellar mass at lower redshifts, the magnitude of the change is significantly smaller than for a mass selected sample. We also find that changes in size and structure continues at {\$}z {\textless} 1{\$}, and is coupled strongly to passivity evolution. We conclude that galaxy structure is driving the quenching of galaxies, such that galaxies become concentrated before they become passive.},

abstract = {Hot, dust-obscured galaxies (Hot DOGs) are a population of hyper-luminous obscured quasars identified by WISE. We present ALMA observations of the [CII] fine-structure line and underlying dust continuum emission in a sample of seven of the most extremely luminous (EL; L{\_}bol {\textgreater}= 10{\^{}}14 L{\_}sun) Hot DOGs, at redshifts z {\~{}} 3.0-4.6. The [CII] line is robustly detected in four objects, tentatively in one, and likely red-shifted out of the spectral window in the remaining two based on additional data. On average, [CII] is red-shifted by {\~{}} 780 km/s from rest-frame ultraviolet emission lines. EL Hot DOGs exhibit consistently very high ionized gas surface densities, with Sigma{\_}[CII] {\~{}} 1-2 x 10{\^{}}9 L{\_}sun/kpc{\^{}}2; as high as the most extreme cases seen in other high-redshift quasars. As a population, EL Hot DOG hosts seem to be roughly centered on the main-sequence of star forming galaxies, but the uncertainties are substantial and individual sources can fall above and below. The average, intrinsic [CII] and dust continuum sizes (FWHMs) are {\~{}} 2.1 kpc and {\~{}} 1.6 kpc, respectively, with a very narrow range of line-to-continuum size ratios, 1.61 +/- 0.10, suggesting they could be linearly proportional. The [CII] velocity fields of EL Hot DOGs are diverse: from barely rotating structures, to resolved hosts with ordered, circular motions, to complex, disturbed systems that are likely the result of ongoing mergers. In contrast, all sources display large line-velocity dispersions, FWHM {\textgreater}{\~{}} 500 km/s, which on average are larger than optically and IR-selected quasars at similar or higher redshifts. We argue that a possible hypothesis for the lack of a common velocity structure, the systematically large dispersion of the ionized gas, and the presence of nearby companion galaxies may be that, rather than a continuous single event, the EL Hot DOG phase could be recurrent.},

abstract = {The multiplexing capability of slitless spectroscopy is a powerful asset in creating large spectroscopic datasets, but issues such as spectral confusion make the interpretation of the data challenging. Here we present a new method to search for emission lines in the slitless spectroscopic data from the 3D-HST survey utilizing the Wide-Field Camera 3 on board the Hubble Space Telescope. Using a novel statistical technique, we can detect compact (extended) emission lines at 90{\%} completeness down to fluxes of 1.5 (3.0) times 10{\^{}}{\{}-17{\}} erg/s/cm{\^{}}2, close to the noise level of the grism exposures, for objects detected in the deep ancillary photometric data. Unlike previous methods, the Bayesian nature allows for probabilistic line identifications, namely redshift estimates, based on secondary emission line detections and/or photometric redshift priors. As a first application, we measure the comoving number density of Extreme Emission Line Galaxies (restframe [O III] 5007 equivalent widths in excess of 500 Angstroms). We find that these galaxies are more than 10 times more common above z{\~{}}1.5 than at z{\textless}0.5. With upcoming large grism surveys such as Euclid and WFIRST, methods like the one presented here will be crucial for constructing emission line redshift catalogs in an automated and well-understood manner.},

Joint 7-band ({\$}grizYJK{\$}) photometric catalogues are produced in a single 3 sq-deg DECam field centred at 02h26m{\$}-{\$}04d36m where the availability of ancillary multi-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy allows us to test the data quality.

Almost 70$\backslash${\%} of DES sources have useful NIR flux measurements in this initial catalogue. Photometric redshifts are estimated for a subset of galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts and initial results, although currently limited by small number statistics, indicate that the VHS data can help reduce the photometric redshift scatter at both {\$}z{\textless}0.5{\$} and {\$}z{\textgreater}1{\$}. We present example DES+VHS colour selection criteria for high redshift Luminous Red Galaxies (LRGs) at {\$}z\backslashsim0.7{\$} as well as luminous quasars. Using spectroscopic observations in this field we show that the additional VHS fluxes enable a cleaner selection of both populations with {\$}{\textless}{\$}10$\backslash${\%} contamination from galactic stars in the case of spectroscopically confirmed quasars and {\$}{\textless}0.5\backslash{\%}{\$} contamination from galactic stars in the case of spectroscopically confirmed LRGs. The combined DES+VHS dataset, which will eventually cover almost 5000 sq-deg, will therefore enable a range of new science and be ideally suited for target selection for future wide-field spectroscopic surveys.},

abstract = {We investigate the evolution of galaxy clustering for galaxies in the redshift range 2.0 {\textless}z{\textless} 5.0 using the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS). We present the projected (real-space) two-point correlation function wp(rp) measured by using 3022 galaxies with robust spectroscopic redshifts in two independent fields (COSMOS and VVDS-02h) covering in total 0.8deg2. We quantify how the scale dependent clustering amplitude r0 changes with redshift making use of mock samples to evaluate and correct the survey selection function. Using a power-law model $\xi$(r) = (r/r0)-$\gamma$ we find that the correlation function for the general population is best fit by a model with a clustering length r0 = 3.95+0.48-0.54 h-1 Mpc and slope $\gamma$ = 1.8+0.02-0.06 at z {\~{}} 2.5, r0 = 4.35 ± 0.60 h-1 Mpc and $\gamma$ = 1.6+0.12-0.13 at z {\~{}} 3.5. We use these clustering parameters to derive the large-scale linear galaxy bias bLPL, between galaxies and dark matter. We find bLPL = 2.68 ± 0.22 at redshift z {\~{}} 3 (assuming $\sigma$8 = 0.8), significantly higher than found at intermediate and low redshifts for the similarly general galaxy populations. We fit a halo occupation distribution (HOD) model to the data and we obtain that the average halo mass at redshift z {\~{}} 3 is Mh = 1011.75 ± 0.23 h-1M⊙. From this fit we confirm that the large-scale linear galaxy bias is relatively high at bLHOD = 2.82 ± 0.27. Comparing these measurements with similar measurements at lower redshifts we infer that the star-forming population of galaxies at z {\~{}} 3 should evolve into the massive and bright (Mr{\textless}-21.5)galaxy population, which typically occupy haloes of mass Mh = 1013.9 h-1M⊙ at redshift z = 0.},

We compare the SMFs for quiescent and star-forming galaxies in the highest and lowest environments using a density estimator based on the distance to the galaxies' third-nearest neighbors. For star-forming galaxies, at all redshifts there are only minor differences with environment in the shape of the SMF. For quiescent galaxies, the SMF in the lowest densities shows no evolution with redshift, other than an overall increase in number density (phi*) with time. This suggests that the stellar-mass dependence of quenching in relatively isolated galaxies is both universal and does not evolve strongly. While at z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 1.5 the SMF of quiescent galaxies is indistinguishable in the highest and lowest densities, at lower redshifts it shows a rapidly increasing number density of lower-mass galaxies, log M / Msun {\~{}}= 9-10. We argue this evolution can account for all the redshift evolution in the shape of the total quiescent-galaxy SMF. This evolution in the quiescent-galaxy SMF at higher redshift (z {\textgreater} 1) requires an environmental-quenching efficiency that decreases with decreasing stellar mass at 0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.5 or it would overproduce the number of lower-mass quiescent galaxies in denser environments. This requires a dominant environment process such as starvation combined with rapid gas depletion and ejection at z {\textgreater} 0.5 - 1.0 for galaxies in our mass range. The efficiency of this process decreases with redshift allowing other processes (such as galaxy interactions and ram-pressure stripping) to become more important at later times, z {\textless} 0.5.},

We show that star forming galaxies at high redshift (z{\textgreater}1.5) are consistent with a model in which the ISM conditions are more extreme at high redshift than seen in the global spectra of local galaxies. We speculate that global spectra of our high redshift galaxies may be dominated by HII regions similar to the extreme clumpy, dense star-forming complexes in the Antennae and M82. The transition to local-type conditions occurs between 0.8{\textless}z{\textless}1.5. We conclude that classification schemes developed for local samples should not be applied at high redshift (z {\textgreater} 1.5). We use our theoretical models to derive a new redshift-dependent classification line that utilizes the standard optical diagnostic line ratios [OIII]/H-beta and [NII]/H-alpha. Our new line can be used to separate star-forming galaxies from AGN between z=0 to z{\~{}}3.5. We anticipate that our redshift-dependent optical classification line will be useful for future large surveys with near-infrared multi-object spectrographs.

abstract = {Since the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope nine years ago, Cepheid distances to 25 galaxies have been determined for the purpose of calibrating secondary distance indicators. A variety of these can now be calibrated, and the accompanying papers by Sakai, Kelson, Ferrarese, and Gibson employ the full set of 25 galaxies to consider the Tully-Fisher relation, the fundamental plane of elliptical galaxies, Type Ia supernovae, and surface brightness fluctuations. When calibrated with Cepheid distances, each of these methods yields a measurement of the Hubble constant and a corresponding measurement uncertainty. We combine these measurements in this paper, together with a model of the velocity field, to yield the best available estimate of the value of H{\_}0 within the range of these secondary distance indicators and its uncertainty. The result is H{\_}0 = 71 +/- 6 km/sec/Mpc. The largest contributor to the uncertainty of this 67{\%} confidence level result is the distance of the Large Magellanic Cloud, which has been assumed to be 50 +/- 3 kpc.},

abstract = {We study the luminosity function of satellite galaxies around isolated primaries using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) spectroscopic and photometric galaxy samples. We select isolated primaries from the spectroscopic sample and search for potential satellites in the much deeper photometric sample. For primaries of similar luminosity to the Milky Way and M31, we are able to stack as many as ∼20000 galaxy systems to obtain robust statistical results. We derive the satellite luminosity function extending almost 8 mag fainter than the primary galaxy. We also determine how the satellite luminosity function varies with the luminosity, colour and concentration of the primary. We find that, in the mean, isolated primaries of comparable luminosity to the Milky Way and M31 contain about a factor of 2 fewer satellites brighter than M V=-14 than the average of the Milky Way and M31. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

abstract = {The multiplexing capability of slitless spectroscopy is a powerful asset in creating large spectroscopic datasets, but issues such as spectral confusion make the interpretation of the data challenging. Here we present a new method to search for emission lines in the slitless spectroscopic data from the 3D-HST survey utilizing the Wide-Field Camera 3 on board the Hubble Space Telescope. Using a novel statistical technique, we can detect compact (extended) emission lines at 90{\%} completeness down to fluxes of 1.5 (3.0) times 10{\^{}}{\{}-17{\}} erg/s/cm{\^{}}2, close to the noise level of the grism exposures, for objects detected in the deep ancillary photometric data. Unlike previous methods, the Bayesian nature allows for probabilistic line identifications, namely redshift estimates, based on secondary emission line detections and/or photometric redshift priors. As a first application, we measure the comoving number density of Extreme Emission Line Galaxies (restframe [O III] 5007 equivalent widths in excess of 500 Angstroms). We find that these galaxies are more than 10 times more common above z{\~{}}1.5 than at z{\textless}0.5. With upcoming large grism surveys such as Euclid and WFIRST, methods like the one presented here will be crucial for constructing emission line redshift catalogs in an automated and well-understood manner.},

abstract = {We present reduced data and data products from the 3D-HST survey, a 248-orbit HST Treasury program. The survey obtained WFC3 G141 grism spectroscopy in four of the five CANDELS fields: AEGIS, COSMOS, GOODS-S, and UDS, along with WFC3 {\$}H{\_}{\{}140{\}}{\$} imaging, parallel ACS G800L spectroscopy, and parallel {\$}I{\_}{\{}814{\}}{\$} imaging. In a previous paper (Skelton et al. 2014) we presented photometric catalogs in these four fields and in GOODS-N, the fifth CANDELS field. Here we describe and present the WFC3 G141 spectroscopic data, again augmented with data from GO-1600 in GOODS-N. The data analysis is complicated by the fact that no slits are used: all objects in the WFC3 field are dispersed, and many spectra overlap. We developed software to automatically and optimally extract interlaced 2D and 1D spectra for all objects in the Skelton et al. (2014) photometric catalogs. The 2D spectra and the multi-band photometry were fit simultaneously to determine redshifts and emission line strengths, taking the morphology of the galaxies explicitly into account. The resulting catalog has 98,663 measured redshifts and line strengths down to {\$}JH{\_}{\{}IR{\}}\backslashleq 26{\$} and 22,548 with {\$}JH{\_}{\{}IR{\}}\backslashleq 24{\$}, where we comfortably detect continuum emission.

abstract = {Several independent lines of evidence suggest that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) in early-type galaxies becomes increasingly "bottom- heavy" with increasing galaxy mass and/or velocity dispersion, $\sigma$. Here we consider evidence for IMF variation in a sample of relatively compact early-type galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. These galaxies are of sufficiently high stellar density that a dark halo likely makes a minor contribution to the total dynamical mass, M dyn, within one effective radius. We fit our detailed stellar population synthesis models to the stacked absorption line spectra of these galaxies in bins of $\sigma$ and find evidence from IMF-sensitive spectral features for a bottom-heavy IMF at high $\sigma$. We also apply simple "mass-follows-light" dynamical models to the same data and find that M dyn is significantly higher than what would be expected if these galaxies were stellar dominated and had a universal Milky Way IMF. Adopting M dyn ≈ M * therefore implies that the IMF is "heavier" at high $\sigma$. Most importantly, the quantitative amount of inferred IMF variation is very similar between the two techniques, agreeing to within ≲ 0.1 dex in mass. The agreement between two independent techniques, when applied to the same data, provides compelling evidence for systematic variation in the IMF as a function of early-type galaxy velocity dispersion. Any alternative explanations must reproduce both the results from dynamical and stellar population-based techniques. {\textcopyright} 2013. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

This makes SN 2013dy the earliest known detection of an SN Ia. We infer an upper limit on the radius of the progenitor star of R{\_}0 {\textless} 0.25 R{\_}sun, consistent with that of a white dwarf.

We find that all 11 galaxies likely quenched near their first pericentric approach. Higher stellar mass galaxies ({\$}\backslashlog(M{\_}\backslashstar/\backslashmathrm{\{}M{\}}{\_}\backslashodot){\textgreater}10{\$}) had formed a higher fraction of their stellar mass (more than {\$}\backslashsim90\backslash{\%}{\$}) than their lower mass counterparts ({\$}\backslashsim 80{\$}-{\$}90\backslash{\%}{\$}) by the time they fell into the cluster (when they cross {\$}2.5r{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}vir{\}}{\$}).

Unlike previous low-redshift studies which suggest that star formation continues until about first apocenter or later, the high percentage of stellar mass already formed by first pericenter in our sample galaxies points to star formation ceasing within a gigayear after the first pericentric passage. We consider the possible physical mechanisms driving quenching and find that our results resemble the situation in clusters at {\$}z\backslashsim1{\$}, where active stripping of gas (ram-pressure or tidally driven) seems to be required to quench satellites by their first pericentric passage. However, a larger sample will be required to conclusively account for the unknown fraction of pre-processed satellites in the Coma cluster.},

Our overdensity search yielded 402 new overdensity candidates with precisely measured redshifts and an unprecedented sensitivity down to low total overdensity masses ({\$}\backslashmathcal {\{}M{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{} tot{\}}{\}}\backslashgtrsim5\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}13{\}}{\$} M⊙). Using the mock catalogues, we estimated the purity and completeness of our overdensity catalogue as a function of redshift, total mass, and spectroscopic redshift fraction, finding impressive levels of both 0.92/0.83 and 0.60/0.49 for purity/completeness at z = 0.8 and z = 1.2, respectively, for all overdensity masses at spectroscopic fractions of ∼20 per cent. With VMC mapping, we are able to measure precise systemic redshifts, provide an estimate of the total gravitating mass, and maintain high levels of purity and completeness at z ∼ 1 even with only moderate levels of spectroscopy. Other methods (e.g. red-sequence overdensities and hot medium reliant detections) begin to fail at similar redshifts, which attests to VMC mapping's potential to be a powerful tool for current and future wide-field galaxy evolution surveys at z ∼ 1 and beyond.},

abstract = {We investigate in this paper the astrophysical false-positive configuration in exoplanet-transit surveys that involves eclipsing binaries and giant planets which present only a secondary eclipse, as seen from the Earth. To test how an eclipsing binary configuration can mimic a planetary transit, we generate synthetic light curve of three examples of secondary-only eclipsing binary systems that we fit with a circular planetary model. Then, to evaluate its occurrence we model a population of binaries in double and triple system based on binary statistics and occurrence. We find that 0.061{\%} +/- 0.017{\%} of main-sequence binary stars are secondary-only eclipsing binaries mimicking a planetary transit candidate down to the size of the Earth. We then evaluate the occurrence that an occulting-only giant planet can mimic an Earth-like planet or even smaller planet. We find that 0.009{\%} +/- 0.002{\%} of stars harbor a giant planet that present only the secondary transit. Occulting-only giant planets mimic planets smaller than the Earth that are in the scope of space missions like Kepler and PLATO. We estimate that up to 43.1 +/- 5.6 Kepler Objects of Interest can be mimicked by this new configuration of false positives, re-evaluating the global false-positive rate of the Kepler mission from 9.4{\%} +/- 0.9{\%} to 11.3{\%} +/- 1.1{\%}. We note however that this new false-positive scenario occurs at relatively long orbital period compared with the median period of Kepler candidates.},

Based on the central idea of the deconvolution algorithm proposed by Magain et al. (1998, ApJ, 494, 472), the method aims at improving the resolution of the data rather than at completely removing the point spread function (PSF). Improvements over the original method include a better regularization of the pixel channel of the image, based on wavelet filtering and multiscale analysis, and a better controlled separation of the point source vs. the extended source. In addition, the method is able to simultaneously deconvolve many individual frames of the same object taken with different instruments under different PSF conditions. For this purpose, we introduce a general geometric transformation between individual images. This transformation allows the combination of the images without having to interpolate them. We illustrate the capability of our algorithm using real and simulated images with complex diffraction-limited PSF.},

We present new CO observations and/or Spitzer mid-IR spectroscopy for 6 70 micron selected galaxies at z{\~{}}1 in order to quantify the properties of the molecular gas reservoir, the contribution of an active galactic nuclei (AGN) to the mid-IR luminosity and the star formation efficiency (SFE=LIR/L'CO). The mid-IR spectra show strong polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission and our spectral decomposition suggests that the AGN makes a minimal contribution ({\textless}25{\%}) to the mid-IR luminosity. The 70 micron selected ULIRGs which we find to be spectroscopic close pairs, are observed to have high SFE, similar to local ULIRGs and high redshift submillimeter galaxies, consistent with enhanced IR luminosity due to an ongoing major merger. Combined with existing observations of local and high redshift ULIRGs, we further compare the PAH, IR and CO luminosities. We show that the ratio LPAH6.2/LIR decreases with increasing IR luminosity for both local and high redshift galaxies but the trend for high redshift galaxies is shifted to higher IR luminosities; the average LPAH6.2/LIR ratio at a given LIR is {\~{}}3 times higher at high redshift. When we normalize by the molecular gas, we find this trend to be uniform for galaxies at all redshifts and that the molecular gas is correlated with the PAH dust emission.The similar trends seen in the [CII] to molecular gas ratios in other studies suggests that PAH emission, like [CII], continues to be a good tracer of photodissociation regions even at high redshift. Together the CO, PAH and far-IR fine structure lines should be useful for constraining the interstellar medium conditions in high redshift galaxies.},

@article{Kennicutt2009,
abstract = {We combine H-alpha emission-line and infrared continuum measurements of two samples of nearby galaxies to derive dust attenuation-corrected star formation rates (SFRs). We use a simple energy balance based method that has been applied previously to HII regions in the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS), and extend the methodology to integrated measurements of galaxies. We find that our composite H-alpha+IR based SFRs are in excellent agreement with attenuation-corrected SFRs derived from integrated spectrophotometry, over the full range of SFRs (0.01 -- 80 solar mass per year) and attenuations (0 -- 2.5 mag) studied. We find that the combination of H-alpha and total infrared luminosities provides the most robust SFR measurements, but combinations of H-alpha measurements with monochromatic luminosities at 24 micron and 8 micron perform nearly as well. The calibrations differ significantly from those obtained for HII regions (Calzetti et al. 2007), with the difference attributable to a more evolved population of stars heating the dust. Our results are consistent with a significant component of diffuse dust (the `IR cirrus' component) that is heated by a non-star-forming population. The same methodology can be applied to [OII]{\$}\backslashlambda{\$}3727 emission-line measurements, and the radio continuum fluxes of galaxies can be applied in place of IR fluxes when the latter are not available. We assess the precision and systematic reliability of all of these composite methods.},

The effect is significant, yet small; the ages of the larger and the smaller subsets differ by only {\$}{\textless}500{\$} Myr, much less than the age variation among individual galaxies ({\$}\backslashsim1.5{\$} Gyr). At the same time, quiescent galaxies with the strongest H{\$}\backslashdelta{\$} absorption --- those experienced recent and rapid quenching events --- tend to be smaller than the average. These co-existing trends unify seemingly contradictory results in the literature; the complex correlations between size and age indicators revealed by our large sample of galaxies with high-quality spectra suggest that there are multiple evolutionary pathways to quiescence. Regardless of the specific physical mechanisms responsible for the cessation of star formation in massive galaxies, the large scatter in D{\$}{\_}n{\$}4000 and EW(H{\$}\backslashdelta{\$}) immediately implies that galaxies follow a large variety in evolutionary pathways. On the one hand, we see evidence for a process that slowly shuts off star-formation and transforms star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies without necessarily changing their structures. On the other hand, there is likely a mechanism that rapidly quenches galaxies, an event that coincides with dramatic structural changes, producing small post-starburst galaxies.},

abstract = {We present spatially resolved imaging obtained with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) of three CO lines in two high-redshift gravitationally lensed dusty star-forming galaxies, discovered by the South Pole Telescope. Strong lensing allows us to probe the structure and dynamics of the molecular gas in these two objects, at z = 2.78 and z = 5.66, with effective source-plane resolution of less than 1 kpc. We model the lensed emission from multiple CO transitions and the dust continuum in a consistent manner, finding that the cold molecular gas as traced by low-J CO always has a larger half-light radius than the 870 $\mu$m dust continuum emission. This size difference leads to up to 50{\%} differences in the magnification factor for the cold gas compared to dust. In the z = 2.78 galaxy, these CO observations confirm that the background source is undergoing a major merger, while the velocity field of the other source is more complex. We use the ATCA CO observations and comparable resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array dust continuum imaging of the same objects to constrain the CO-H2 conversion factor with three different procedures, finding good agreement between the methods and values consistent with those found for rapidly star-forming systems. We discuss these galaxies in the context of the star formation - gas mass surface density relation, noting that the change in emitting area with observed CO transition must be accounted for when comparing high-redshift galaxies to their lower redshift counterparts.},

abstract = {We characterize the radial and angular variance of the Hubble flow in the COMPOSITE sample of 4534 galaxies, on scales in which much of the flow is in the nonlinear regime. Independent of any cosmological assumptions other than the existence of a suitably averaged linear Hubble law, we find with decisive Bayesian evidence (ln B {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 5) that the Hubble constant averaged in spherical radial shells is closer to its asymptotic value when referred to the rest frame of the Local Group rather than the standard rest frame of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Angular averages reveal a dipole structure in the Hubble flow, whose amplitude in the two rest frames changes in correlation with the monopole variation within spheres of radius 30/h - 62/h Mpc in markedly different ways, with 99.99{\%} confidence. The angular map of Hubble flow variation is found to coincide with that of the residual CMB temperature dipole in the Local Group rest frame, with correlation coefficient -0.92. The combined results of the monopole and dipole variations do not support the standard kinematic interpretation of the motion of the Local Group in response to the clustering dipole, but are consistent with a foreground non-kinematic anisotropy in the distance-redshift relation of 0.5{\%} on scales up to 65/h Mpc. Effectively, the differential expansion of space produced by nearby nonlinear structures of local voids and denser walls and filaments cannot be reduced to a local boost. This hypothesis suggests a reinterpretation of bulk flows, which may potentially impact on calibration of supernovae distances, anomalies associated with large angles in the CMB anisotropy spectrum, and the dark flow inferred from the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect. It is consistent with recent studies that find evidence for a non-kinematic dipole in the distribution of distant radio sources.},

abstract = {Petrosian magnitudes were designed to help with the difficult task of determining a galaxy's total light. Although these magnitudes [taken here as the flux within 2RP, with the inverted Petrosian index 1/$\eta$(RP)=0.2] can represent most of an object's$\backslash$nflux, they do of course miss the light outside the Petrosian aperture (2RP). The size of this flux deficit varies monotonically with the shape of a galaxy's light profile, i.e., its concentration. In the case of a de Vaucouleurs R1/4 profile, the deficit is 0.20 mag; for an R1/8 profile this figure rises to 0.50 mag. Here we provide a simple method for recovering total (S{\'{e}}rsic)$\backslash$nmagnitudes from Petrosian magnitudes using only the galaxy concentration (R90/R50 or R80/R20) within the Petrosian aperture. The corrections hold to the extent that$\backslash$nS{\'{e}}rsic's model provides a good description of a galaxy's$\backslash$nluminosity profile. We show how the concentration can also be used to convert Petrosian radii into effective half-light radii, enabling a robust measure of the mean effective surface brightness. Our technique is applied to the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 2 (SDSS DR2) Petrosian parameters, yielding good agreement with the total magnitudes, effective radii, and mean effective surface brightnesses obtained from the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog S{\'{e}}rsic$\backslash$nR1/n fits by Blanton and coworkers. Although the corrective procedure described here is specifically applicable to the SDSS DR2 and DR3, it is generally applicable to all imaging data where any Petrosian index and concentration can be constructed.},

In total, of 2161 Ly$\alpha$ emitters, there are 1394 in the SSA22 fields and 767 in the general fields detected at the narrowband AB magnitude limit of 25.73, which corresponds to the line flux of ≈1.8 × 10 -17ergs -1 cm -2 or the luminosity of ≈1.5 × 10 42ergs -1 at z = 3.1, above the observed equivalent-width threshold, 190{\AA} . The average surface number density of the emitters at z = 3.1 in the general fields above the thresholds is 0.20 ± 0.01arcmin -2. The SSA22 high-density region at z = 3.09, whose peak local density is six times that of the average, is found to be the most prominent outstanding structure in the whole surveyed area and is firmly identified as a robust "protocluster." We also compared the overdensity of the 100arcmin 2 and 700arcmin 2 areas which contain the protocluster with the expected fluctuation of the dark matter as well as those of the model galaxies in cosmological simulations. We found that the peak height values of the overdensity are 8-10 and 3-4 times the expected standard deviations for the counts of Ly$\alpha$ emitters at z = 3.1 in the corresponding volume, respectively. We conclude that the structure at z = 3.09 in the SSA22 field is a very significant and rare density peak up to the scale of ≈60Mpc. {\textcopyright} 2012. The American Astronomical Society.

These data are used to constrain the extinction law in the UV for our galaxies and to compare the absorbed radiation in the UV range with the emission in the IR range. We find that the modelled far- and near-UV apparent magnitudes are in good agreement with the observed GALEX magnitudes. It is found that galaxies with low and high equivalent widths EW(Hbeta) of the Hbeta emission line require different reddening laws with steeper slopes for galaxies with higher EW(H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$}). This implies an important role of the hard ionising radiation in shaping the dust grain size distribution. The IR emission in the range of 8-1000 mum is determined using existing data obtained by various infrared space telescopes. We find that the radiation energy absorbed in the UV range is nearly equal to the energy emitted in the IR range leaving very little room for hidden star formation in our galaxies. Using extinction-corrected Hbeta luminosities and modelled SEDs in the UV range we derive efficiencies of ionising photon production $\backslash$xi for the entire sample of CSFGs. It is found that {\$}\backslashxi{\$} in CSFGs with high EW(Hbeta) are among the highest known for low- and high-redshift galaxies. If galaxies with similar properties existed at redshifts z=5-10, they could be considered as promising candidates for the reionisation of the Universe.},

abstract = {Surface densities of gas, dust and stars provide a window into the physics of star-formation that, until the advent of high-resolution far-infrared/sub-millimeter observations, has been historically difficult to assess amongst dusty galaxies. To study the link between infrared (IR) surface densities and dust properties, we leverage the Atacama Large Millimetre/Submillimetre Array (ALMA) archive to measure the extent of cold dust emission in 15 {\$}z\backslashsim2{\$} IR selected galaxies selected on the basis of having available mid-IR spectroscopy from Spitzer. We use the mid-IR spectra to constrain the relative balance between dust heating from star-formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN), and to measure emission from Polycylic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) -- small dust grains that play a key role in the photoelectric heating of gas. In general, we find that dust-obscured star-formation at high IR surface densities exhibits similar properties at low- and high-redshift, namely: local luminous IR galaxies have comparable PAH luminosity to total dust mass ratios as high-{\$}z{\$} galaxies, and star-formation at {\$}z\backslashsim0-2{\$} is more efficient at high IR surface densities despite the fact that our sample of high{\$}-z{\$} galaxies are closer to the main-sequence than local luminous IR galaxies. High star-formation efficiencies are coincident with a decline in the PAH/IR luminosity ratio reminiscent of the deficit observed in far-infrared fine-structure lines. Changes in the gas and dust conditions arising from high star-formation surface densities might help drive the star-formation efficiency up. This could help explain high efficiencies needed to reconcile star-formation and gas volume densities in dusty galaxies at cosmic noon.},

abstract = {Modern cosmological simulations model the universe with increasing sophistication and at higher spatial and temporal resolutions. These enhancements permit detailed comparisons between the simulation outputs and real observational data. Recent projects such as Illustris are capable of producing simulated images that are comparable to those obtained from local surveys. This paper tests how well Illustris achieves this goal across a diverse population of galaxies using visual morphologies derived from Galaxy Zoo citizen scientists. Morphological classifications provided by volunteers for simulated galaxies are compared with similar data for a compatible sample of images drawn from the SDSS Legacy Survey. This paper investigates how simple morphological characterization by human volunteers asked to distinguish smooth from featured systems differs between simulated and real galaxy images. Differences are identified, which are likely due to the limited resolution of the simulation, but which could be revealing real differences in the dynamical evolution of populations of galaxies in the real and model universes. Specifically, for stellar masses {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}\backslashlesssim10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, a larger proportion of Illustris galaxies that exhibit disk-like morphology or visible substructure, relative to their SDSS counterparts. Toward higher masses, simulated and observed galaxies converge and exhibit similar morphology distributions. The stellar mass threshold indicated by this divergent behavior confirms recent works using parametric measures of morphology from Illustris simulated images. When {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}\backslashgtrsim10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, the Illustris dataset contains fewer galaxies that classifiers regard as unambiguously featured. These results suggest that comparison between the detailed properties of observed and simulated galaxies, even when limited to reasonably massive systems, may be misleading.},

By the use of a sophisticated physical plus systematic uncertainties model, constructed within the Bagpipes code, we place strong constraints on the star-formation histories (SFHs) of individual objects. We firstly constrain the stellar mass vs stellar age relationship, finding a strong trend towards earlier formation with increasing stellar mass (downsizing) of {\$}1.48{\^{}}{\{}+0.34{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.39{\}}{\$} Gyr per decade in mass. We show that this is consistent with other spectroscopic studies from {\$}0 {\textless} z {\textless} 2{\$}. This relationship places strong constraints on the AGN-feedback models used in cosmological simulations. We demonstrate that, although the relationships predicted by Simba and IllustrisTNG agree well with observations at {\$}z=0.1{\$}, they are too shallow at {\$}z=1{\$}, predicting an evolution of {\$}\backslashlesssim0.5{\$} Gyr per decade in mass. Secondly, we consider the connections between green-valley, post-starburst and quiescent galaxies, using our inferred SFH shapes and the distributions of galaxy physical properties on the UVJ diagram.

The most massive galaxies in our sample are extreme systems: already old by {\$}z=1{\$}, they formed at {\$}z\backslashsim5{\$} and quenched by {\$}z=3{\$}.

abstract = {A simple two-color selection based on B-, z-, and K-band photometry is proposed for culling galaxies at 1.4{\textless}{\~{}}z{\textless}{\~{}}2.5 in K-selected samples and classifying them as star-forming or passive systems. The method is calibrated on the highly complete spectroscopic redshift database of the K20 survey, verified with simulations and tested on other data sets. Requiring BzK=(z-K)AB-(B-z)AB{\textgreater}-0.2 allows us to select actively star-forming galaxies at z{\textgreater}{\~{}}1.4, independently of their dust reddening. On the other hand, objects with BzK{\textless}-0.2 and (z-K)AB{\textgreater}2.5 colors include passively evolving galaxies at z{\textgreater}{\~{}}1.4, often with spheroidal morphologies. Simple recipes to estimate the reddening, star formation rates (SFRs), and masses of BzK-selected galaxies are derived and are calibrated on K{\textless}20 galaxies. These K{\textless}20 galaxies have typical stellar masses of {\~{}}1011 Msolar and sky and volume densities of {\~{}}1 arcmin-2 and {\~{}}10-4 Mpc-3, respectively. Based on their UV (reddening-corrected), X-ray, and radio luminosities, the BzK-selected star-forming galaxies with K{\textless}20 turn out to have average SFR{\~{}}200 Msolar yr-1 and median reddening E(B-V){\~{}}0.4. This SFR is a factor of 10 higher than that of z{\~{}}1 dusty extremely red objects, and a factor of 3 higher than found for z{\~{}}2 UV-selected galaxies, both at similar K limits. Besides missing the passively evolving galaxies, the UV selection appears to miss some relevant fraction of the z{\~{}}2 star-forming galaxies with K{\textless}20, and hence of the (obscured) SFR density at this redshift. The high SFRs and masses add to other existing evidence that these z=2 star-forming galaxies may be among the precursors of z=0 early-type galaxies. A V/Vmax test suggests that such a population may be increasing in number density with increasing redshift. Theoretical models cannot reproduce simultaneously the space density of both passively evolving and highly star-forming galaxies at z=2. In view of Spitzer Space Telescope observations, an analogous technique based on RJL photometry is proposed to complement the BzK selection and to identify massive galaxies at 2.5{\textless}{\~{}}z{\textless}{\~{}}4.0. By selecting passively evolving galaxies as well as actively star-forming galaxies (including strongly dust-reddened ones), these color criteria should help in completing the census of the stellar mass and of the SFR density at high redshift.

We identify a master sample of H{\$}\backslashdelta{\$} strong (EW{\$}{\_}{\{}H\backslashdelta{\}}{\$} {\textgreater} 3$\backslash$AA) post-starburst galaxies from the value-added catalogue in the 7th data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR7) over a redshift range 0.01 {\textless} {\$}z{\$} {\textless} 0.1. From this sample we select two E+A subsets, both having a very little [OII] emission (EW{\$}{\_}{\{}[OII]{\}}{\$} {\$}{\textgreater} -2.5{\$}$\backslash$AA) but one having an additional cut on EW{\$}{\_}{\{}H\backslashalpha{\}}{\$} ({\$}{\textgreater} -3{\$}$\backslash$AA). We examine the differences in observables and AGN fractions to see what effect the H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} cut has on the properties of post-starburst galaxies and what these differing samples can tell us about the duty cycle of post-starburst galaxies. We find that H{\$}\backslashdelta{\$} strong galaxies peak in the `blue cloud', E+As in the `green valley' and pure E+As in the `red sequence'. We also find that pure E+As have a more early-type morphology and a higher fraction in denser environments compared with the H{\$}\backslashdelta{\$} strong and E+A galaxies. These results suggest that there is an evolutionary sequence in the post-starburst phase from blue disky galaxies with residual star formation to passive red early-types.},

abstract = {We study integrated characteristics of {\~{}}14000 low-redshift (0{\textless}z{\textless}1) compact star-forming galaxies (SFGs) selected from the Data Release 12 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. It is found that emission of these galaxies is dominated by strong young bursts of star formation, implying that their luminosities experience rapid variations on a time scale of a few Myr. Reducing integrated characteristics of these galaxies to zero burst age would result in a considerably tighter and almost linear relation between stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR). The same correction implies that the specific star formation rate (the ratio of SFR and stellar mass) is not dependent on the galaxy stellar mass. We conclude that the correction for rapid luminosity evolution must be taken into account in a similar way when comparing different samples of low- and high-redshift SFGs. If the bursting nature of star formation and young burst ages are characteristics of the galaxies selected at high redshifts, the age correction of observed SFRs derived from the Hbeta emission line or UV continua would modify the derived SFR densities in the early universe.},

Early-time spectra of SN 2002cx evolve very quickly and are dominated by lines from Fe-group elements; features from intermediate-mass elements (Ca, S, Si) are weak or absent. Mysterious emission lines are observed around 7000 $\backslash$AA$\backslash$ at about 3 weeks after maximum brightness. The nebular spectrum of SN 2002cx is also unique, consisting of narrow iron and cobalt lines. The observations of SN 2002cx are inconsistent with the observed spectral/photometric sequence, and provide a major challenge to our understanding of SNe Ia.

abstract = {We present Ha maps at 1kpc spatial resolution for star-forming galaxies at z{\~{}}1, made possible by the WFC3 grism on HST. Employing this capability over all five 3D-HST/CANDELS fields provides a sample of 2676 galaxies. By creating deep stacked Halpha (Ha) images, we reach surface brightness limits of 1x10{\^{}}-18$\backslash$erg$\backslash$s$\backslash$cm{\^{}}2$\backslash$arcsec{\^{}}2, allowing us to map the distribution of ionized gas out to {\textgreater}10kpc for typical L* galaxies at this epoch. We find that the spatial extent of the Ha distribution increases with stellar mass as r(Ha)[kpc]=1.5(Mstars/10{\^{}}10Msun){\^{}}0.23. Furthermore, the Ha emission is more extended than the stellar continuum emission, consistent with inside-out assembly of galactic disks. This effect, however, is mass dependent with r(Ha)/r(stars)=1.1(M/10{\^{}}10Msun){\^{}}0.054, such that at low masses r(Ha){\~{}}r(stars). We map the Ha distribution as a function of SFR(IR+UV) and find evidence for `coherent star formation' across the SFR-M plane: above the main sequence, Ha is enhanced at all radii; below the main sequence, Ha is depressed at all radii. This suggests that at all masses the physical processes driving the enhancement or suppression of star formation act throughout the disks of galaxies. It also confirms that the scatter in the star forming main sequence is real and caused by variations in the star formation rate at fixed mass. At high masses (10{\^{}}10.5{\textless}M/Msun{\textless}10{\^{}}11), above the main sequence, Ha is particularly enhanced in the center, plausibly building bulges and/or supermassive black holes. Below the main sequence, the star forming disks are more compact and a strong central dip in the EW(Ha), and the inferred specific star formation rate, appears. Importantly though, across the entirety of the SFR-M plane, the absolute star formation rate as traced by Ha is always centrally peaked, even in galaxies below the main sequence.},

abstract = {Tracing the emergence of the massive quiescent galaxy (QG) population requires the build-up of reliable quenched samples by distinguishing these systems from red, dusty star-forming sources. We present Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/G141 grism spectra of ten quiescent galaxy candidates selected at 2.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.5 in the COSMOS field. Spectroscopic confirmation for the whole sample is obtained within one to three orbits through the detection of strong spectral breaks and Balmer absorption lines. When their spectra are combined with optical to near-infrared photometry, star-forming solutions are formally rejected for the entire sample. Broad spectral indices are consistent with the presence of young A-type stars, which indicates that the last major episode of star formation has taken place no earlier than ∼300–800 Myr prior to observation. This confirms clues from their post-starburst UVJ colors. Marginalising over three different slopes of the dust attenuation curve, we obtain young mass-weighted ages and an average peak star formation rate (SFR) of ∼10 3 M ⊙ yr −1 at z formation ∼ 3.5. Although mid- and far-IR data are too shallow to determine the obscured SFR on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis, the mean stacked emission from 3 GHz data constrains the level of residual-obscured SFR to be globally below 50 M ⊙ yr −1 , three times below the scatter of the coeval main sequence. Alternatively, the very same radio detection suggests a widespread radio-mode feedback by active galactic nuclei (AGN) four times stronger than in z ∼ 1.8 massive QGs. This is accompanied by a 30{\%} fraction of X-ray luminous AGN with a black hole accretion rate per unit SFR enhanced by a factor of ∼30 with respect to similarly massive QGs at lower redshift. The average compact, high S{\'{e}}rsic index morphologies of the galaxies in this sample, coupled with their young mass-weighted ages, suggest that the mechanisms responsible for the development of a spheroidal component might be concomitant with (or preceding) those causing their quenching.},

abstract = {Recent studies have found that the oldest and most luminous galaxies in the early Universe are surprisingly compact, having stellar masses similar to present-day elliptical galaxies but much smaller sizes. This finding has attracted considerable attention, as it suggests that massive galaxies have grown in size by a factor of about five over the past ten billion years (10 Gyr). A key test of these results is a determination of the stellar kinematics of one of the compact galaxies: if the sizes of these objects are as extreme as has been claimed, their stars are expected to have much higher velocities than those in present-day galaxies of the same mass. Here we report a measurement of the stellar velocity dispersion of a massive compact galaxy at redshift z = 2.186, corresponding to a look-back time of 10.7 Gyr. The velocity dispersion is very high at km s-1, consistent with the mass and compactness of the galaxy inferred from photometric data. This would indicate significant recent structural and dynamical evolution of massive galaxies over the past 10 Gyr. The uncertainty in the dispersion was determined from simulations that include the effects of noise and template mismatch. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that some subtle systematic effect may have influenced the analysis, given the low signal-to-noise ratio of our spectrum. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

We explore the relationship between rest-frame optical color, stellar mass, star formation activity and galaxy structure. We confirm the dramatic increase from z=2.2 to the present day in the number density of non-star-forming galaxies above 3e10M{\_}sun reported by others. We further find that the vast majority of these quiescent systems have concentrated light profiles, as parametrized by the Sersic index, and the population of concentrated galaxies grows similarly rapidly. We examine the joint distribution of star formation activity, Sersic index, stellar mass, inferred velocity dispersion, and stellar surface density. Quiescence correlates poorly with stellar mass at all z{\textless}2.2. Quiescence correlates well with Sersic index at all redshifts. Quiescence correlates well with `velocity dispersion' and stellar surface density at z{\textgreater}1.3, and somewhat less well at lower redshifts. Yet, there is significant scatter between quiescence and galaxy structure: while the vast majority of quiescent galaxies have prominent bulges, many of them have significant disks, and a number of bulge-dominated galaxies have significant star formation. Noting the rarity of quiescent galaxies without prominent bulges, we argue that a prominent bulge (and perhaps, by association, a supermassive black hole) is an important condition for quenching star formation on galactic scales over the last 10Gyr, in qualitative agreement with the AGN feedback paradigm.},

abstract = {The mid-infrared local luminosity function is evolved with redshift to fit the spectrum of the cosmic infrared background (CIRB) at $\lambda${\textgreater}5 $\mu$m and the galaxy counts from various surveys at mid-infrared, far-infrared, and submillimeter wavelengths. A variety of evolutionary models provide satisfactory fits to the CIRB and the number counts. The degeneracy in the range of models cannot be broken by current observations. However, the different evolutionary models yield approximately the same comoving number density of infrared luminous galaxies as a function of redshift. Since the spectrum of the cosmic background at $\lambda${\textgreater}200 $\mu$m is quite sensitive to the evolution at high redshift, i.e., z{\textgreater}1, all models that fit the counts require a flattening at z{\~{}}0.8 to avoid overproducing the CIRB. About 80{\%} of the 140 $\mu$m CIRB is produced at 0{\textless}z{\textless}1.5, while only about 30{\%} of the 850 $\mu$m background is produced within the same redshift range. The nature of the evolution is then translated into a measure of the dust-enshrouded star formation rate (SFR) density as a function of redshift and compared with estimates from rest-frame optical/ultraviolet surveys. The dust-enshrouded SFR density appears to peak at z=0.8+/-0.1, much sooner than previously thought, with a value of 0.25+0.12-0.1 Msolar yr-1 Mpc-3, and remains almost constant up to z{\~{}}2. At least 70{\%} of this star formation takes place in infrared luminous galaxies with LIR{\textgreater}1011 Lsolar. The long-wavelength observations that constrain our evolutionary models do not strongly trace the evolution at z{\textgreater}2 and a drop-off in the dust-enshrouded SFR density is consistent with both the CIRB spectrum and the number counts. However, a comparison with the infrared luminosity function derived from extinction-corrected rest-frame optical/ultraviolet observations of the Lyman break galaxy population at z{\~{}}3 suggests that the almost flat comoving SFR density seen between redshifts of 0.8 and 2 extends up to a redshift of z{\~{}}4.},

abstract = {We present a new semi-analytic model that self-consistently traces the growth of supermassive black holes (BH) and their host galaxies within the context of the LCDM cosmological framework. In our model, the energy emitted by accreting black holes regulates the growth of the black holes themselves, drives galactic scale winds that can remove cold gas from galaxies, and produces powerful jets that heat the hot gas atmospheres surrounding groups and clusters. We present a comprehensive comparison of our model predictions with observational measurements of key physical properties of low-redshift galaxies, such as cold gas fractions, stellar metallicities and ages, and specific star formation rates. We find that our new models successfully reproduce the exponential cutoff in the stellar mass function and the stellar and cold gas mass densities at z{\~{}}0, and predict that star formation should be largely, but not entirely, quenched in massive galaxies at the present day. We also find that our model of self-regulated BH growth naturally reproduces the observed relation between BH mass and bulge mass. We explore the global formation history of galaxies in our models, presenting predictions for the cosmic histories of star formation, stellar mass assembly, cold gas, and metals. We find that models assuming the "concordance" LCDM cosmology overproduce star formation and stellar mass at high redshift (z{\textgreater}2). A model with less small-scale power predicts less star formation at high redshift, and excellent agreement with the observed stellar mass assembly history, but may have difficulty accounting for the cold gas in quasar absorption systems at high redshift (z{\~{}}3-4).},

abstract = {We present the evolution of the stellar mass function (SMF) of galaxies from z = 4.0 to z = 1.3 measured from a sample constructed from the deep near-infrared Multi-wavelength Survey by Yale-Chile, the Faint Infrared Extragalactic Survey, and the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-Chandra Deep Field South surveys, all having very high-quality optical to mid-infrared data. This sample, unique in that it combines data from surveys with a large range of depths and areas in a self-consistent way, allowed us to (1) minimize the uncertainty due to cosmic variance and empirically quantify its contribution to the total error budget; (2) simultaneously probe the high-mass end and the low-mass end (down to 0.05 times the characteristic stellar mass) of the SMF with good statistics; and (3) empirically derive the redshift-dependent completeness limits in stellar mass. We provide, for the first time, a comprehensive analysis of random and systematic uncertainties affecting the derived SMFs, including the effect of metallicity, extinction law, stellar population synthesis model, and initial mass function. We find that the mass density evolves by a factor of 17+7-10 since z = 4.0, mostly driven by a change in the normalization $\Phi$. If only random errors are taken into account, we find evidence for mass-dependent evolution, with the low-mass end evolving more rapidly than the high-mass end. However, we show that this result is no longer robust when systematic uncertainties due to the SED-modeling assumptions are taken into account. Another significant uncertainty is the contribution to the overall stellar mass density of galaxies below our mass limit; future studies with WFC3 will provide better constraints on the SMF at masses below 1010 M at z{\textgreater}2. Taking our results at face value, we find that they are in conflict with semianalytic models of galaxy formation. The models predict SMFs that are in general too steep, with too many low-mass galaxies and too few high-mass galaxies. The discrepancy at the high-mass end is susceptible to uncertainties in the models and the data, but the discrepancy at the low-mass end may be more difficult to explain. {\textcopyright} 2009 The American Astronomical Society.

abstract = {We use the Mitchell Spectrograph (formerly VIRUS-P) on the McDonald Observatory 2.7m Harlan J. Smith Telescope to search for the chemical signatures of massive elliptical galaxy assembly. The Mitchell Spectrograph is an integral-field spectrograph with a uniquely wide field of view (107x107 sq arcsec), allowing us to achieve remarkably high signal-to-noise ratios of {\~{}}20-70 per pixel in radial bins of 2-2.5 times the effective radii of the eight galaxies in our sample. Focusing on a sample of massive elliptical galaxies with stellar velocity dispersions sigma* {\textgreater} 150 km/s, we study the radial dependence in the equivalent widths (EWs) of key metal absorption lines. By twice the effective radius, the Mgb EWs have dropped by {\~{}}50{\%}, and only a weak correlation between sigma* and Mgb EW remains. The Mgb EWs at large radii are comparable to those seen in the centers of elliptical galaxies that are approximately an order of magnitude less massive. We find that the well-known metallicity gradients often observed within an effective radius continue smoothly to 2.5R{\_}e, while the abundance ratio gradients remain flat. Much like the halo of the Milky Way, the stellar halos of our galaxies have low metallicities and high alpha-abundance ratios, as expected for very old stars formed in small stellar systems. Our observations support a picture in which the outer parts of massive elliptical galaxies are built by the accretion of much smaller systems whose star formation history was truncated at early times.},

abstract = {We study dust attenuation at UV wavelengths at high redshift, where the UV is redshifted to the observed visible. In particular, we search for a UV bump and related implications for dust attenuation determinations. We use data in the CDFS, obtained in intermediate and broad band filters by the MUSYC project, to sample the UV rest-frame of 751 galaxies with 0.95{\textless}z{\textless}2.2. When available, Herschel/PACS data (GOODS-Herschel project), and Spitzer/MIPS measurements, are used to estimate the dust emission. The SED of each source is fit using the CIGALE code. The amount of dust attenuation and the dust attenuation curve are obtained as outputs of the SED fitting process, together with other parameters linked to the SFH. The global amount of dust attenuation at UV wavelengths is found to increase with stellar mass and to decrease as UV luminosity increases. A UV bump at 2175A is securely detected in 20{\%} of the galaxies, and the mean amplitude of the bump for the sample is similar to that observed in the LMC supershell region. This amplitude is found to be lower in galaxies with very high SSFRs, and 90{\%} of the galaxies exhibiting a secure bump are at z{\textless}1.5. The attenuation curve is confirmed to be steeper than that of local starburst galaxies for 20{\$}{\%} of the galaxies. The large dispersion found for these two parameters describing the attenuation law is likely to reflect a wide diversity of attenuation laws among galaxies. The relations between dust attenuation, IR-to-UV flux ratio, and the slope of the UV continuum are derived for the mean attenuation curve found for our sample. Deviations from the average trends are found to correlate with the age of the young stellar population and the shape of the attenuation curve.(abriged)},

We find strong evolution in the SFR function, with the typical SFR of SFGs declining exponentially in the last 11 Gyr as SFR*(T[Gyr]) = 104.23/T + 0.37 M⊙ yr-1, but with no evolution in the faint-end slope, $\alpha$ ≈ -1.6. The stellar mass function of SFGs, however, reveals little evolution: $\alpha$ ≈ -1.4, M* ˜ 1011.2 ± 0.2 M⊙ and just a slight increase of ˜2.3× in $\Phi$* from z = 2.23 to z = 0.4. The stellar mass density within SFGs has been roughly constant since z = 2.23 at ˜107.65 ± 0.08 M⊙ Mpc-3, comprising ≈100 per cent of the stellar mass density in all galaxies at z = 2.23, and declining to ≈20 per cent by z = 0.40, driven by the rise of the passive population. We find that SFGs with ˜1010.0 ± 0.2 M⊙ contribute most to the SFR density ($\rho$SFR) per d log10M, and that there is no significant evolution in the fractional contribution from SFGs of different masses to $\rho$SFR or $\rho$SFR(d log10M)-1 since z = 2.23. Instead, we show that the decline of SFR* and of $\rho$SFR is primarily driven by an exponential decline in SFRs at all masses. Our results have important implications not only on how SFGs need to be quenched across cosmic time, but also on the driver(s) of the exponential decline in SFR* from ˜66 M⊙ yr-1 to 5 M⊙ yr-1 since z ˜ 2.23.},

abstract = {Advances in instrumentation have recently extended detailed measurements of gas kinematics to large samples of high-redshift galaxies. Relative to most nearby, thin disk galaxies, in which gas rotation accurately traces the gravitational potential, the interstellar medium (ISM) of z{\textgreater}1 galaxies is typically more dynamic and exhibits elevated turbulence. If not properly modeled, these effects can strongly bias dynamical mass measurements. We use high-resolution FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations to analyze the physical effects that must be considered to correctly infer dynamical masses from gas kinematics. Our analysis covers a wide range of galaxy properties, from low-redshift Milky-Way-mass galaxies to massive high-redshift galaxies (M{\_}* {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}11 M{\_}sun at z=1). Selecting only snapshots where a well-ordered disk is present, we calculate the rotational profile {\textless}v{\_}phi{\textgreater}(r) of the cool (10{\^{}}3.5 K {\textless} T {\textless} 10{\^{}}4.5 K) gas and compare it to the circular velocity v{\_}c=sqrt(GM{\_}enc/r) assuming spherical symmetry. In the simulated massive high-redshift galaxies, the gas rotation traces the circular velocity reasonably well at intermediate radii r{\~{}}1-3 kpc, but the two quantities diverge significantly outside that range. At larger radii, gradients in the turbulent pressure can bias dynamical mass measurements low by {\~{}}10-40{\%}. In the interior, the assumption of a spherically-symmetric gravitational potential becomes increasingly poor owing to a massive disk component, reducing the gas rotational velocities by {\textgreater}{\~{}}10{\%}. Finally, in the interior and exterior, the gas' motion can be significantly non-circular due to e.g. bars, satellites, and inflows/outflows. We discuss the accuracy of commonly-used analytic models for pressure gradients (or "asymmetric drift") in the ISM of high-redshift galaxies.},

abstract = {We present a catalog of 10718 objects in the COSMOS field observed through multi-slit spectroscopy with the Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph (DEIMOS) on the Keck II telescope in the wavelength range {\~{}}5500-9800A. The catalog contains 6617 objects with high-quality spectra (two or more spectral features), and 1798 objects with a single spectroscopic feature confirmed by the photometric redshift. For 2024 typically faint objects we could not obtain reliable redshifts. The objects have been selected from a variety of input catalogs based on multi-wavelength observations in the field, and thus have a diverse selection function, which enables the study of the diversity in the galaxy population. The magnitude distribution of our objects is peaked at I{\_}AB{\~{}}23 and K{\_}AB{\~{}}21, with a secondary peak at K{\_}AB{\~{}}24. We sample a broad redshift distribution in the range 0{\textless}z{\textless}6, with one peak at z{\~{}}1, and another one around z{\~{}}4. We have identified 13 redshift spikes at z{\textgreater}0.65 with chance probabilities {\textless}4xE-4{\$}, some of which are clearly related to protocluster structures of sizes {\textgreater}10 Mpc. An object-to-object comparison with a multitude of other spectroscopic samples in the same field shows that our DEIMOS sample is among the best in terms of fraction of spectroscopic failures and relative redshift accuracy. We have determined the fraction of spectroscopic blends to about 0.8{\%} in our sample. This is likely a lower limit and at any rate well below the most pessimistic expectations. Interestingly, we find evidence for strong lensing of Ly-alpha background emitters within the slits of 12 of our target galaxies, increasing their apparent density by about a factor of 4.},

abstract = {Using a compilation of 25 studies from the literature, we investigate the evolution of the star-forming galaxy (SFG) main sequence (MS) in stellar mass and star formation rate (SFR) out to z {\~{}} 6. After converting all observations to a common set of calibrations, we find a remarkable consensus among MS observations ({\~{}}0.1 dex 1$\sigma$ interpublication scatter). By fitting for time evolution of the MS in bins of constant mass, we deconvolve the observed scatter about the MS within each observed redshift bin. After accounting for observed scatter between different SFR indicators, we find the width of the MS distribution is {\~{}}0.2 dex and remains constant over cosmic time. Our best fits indicate the slope of the MS is likely time-dependent, with our best-fit log SFR(M *, t) = (0.84 ± 0.02 - 0.026 ± 0.003 × t)log M * - (6.51 ± 0.24 - 0.11 ± 0.03 × t), where t is the age of the universe in Gyr. We use our fits to create empirical evolutionary tracks in order to constrain MS galaxy star formation histories (SFHs), finding that (1) the most accurate representations of MS SFHs are given by delayed-$\tau$ models, (2) the decline in fractional stellar mass growth for a "typical" MS galaxy today is approximately linear for most of its lifetime, and (3) scatter about the MS can be generated by galaxies evolving along identical evolutionary tracks assuming an initial 1$\sigma$ spread in formation times of {\~{}}1.4 Gyr.},

This is the first time that the H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$}+[OIII] and [OII] luminosity functions have been studied at these redshifts in a self-consistent analysis. This is also the largest sample of [OII] and H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$}+[OIII] emitters (3475 and 3298 emitters, respectively) in this redshift range, with large co-moving volumes {\$}\backslashsim 1 \backslashtimes 10{\^{}}6{\$} Mpc{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$} in two independent volumes (COSMOS and UDS), greatly reducing the effects of cosmic variance.

We find a strong increase in {\$}L{\_}\backslashstar{\$} and a decrease in {\$}\backslashphi{\_}\backslashstar{\$} for both H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$}+[OIII] and [OII] emitters.

We present a search of large scale structure around a galaxy cluster core at {\$}z=2.095{\$} using a set of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies. We find that both color-selected star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) show significant overdensities around the {\$}z=2.095{\$} cluster. A total of 8 DSFGs (including 3 X-ray luminous active galactic nuclei, AGNs) and 34 SFGs are found within a 10 arcmin radius (corresponds to {\$}\backslashsim{\$}15 cMpc at {\$}z\backslashsim2.1{\$}) from the cluster center and within a redshift range of {\$}\backslashDelta z=0.02{\$}, which leads to galaxy overdensities of {\$}\backslashdelta{\_}{\{}\backslashrm DSFG{\}}\backslashsim12.3{\$} and {\$}\backslashdelta{\_}{\{}\backslashrm SFG{\}}\backslashsim2.8{\$}. The cluster core and the extended DSFG- and SFG-rich structure together demonstrate an active cluster formation phase, in which the cluster is accreting a significant amount of material from large scale structure while the more mature core may begin to virialize. Our finding of this DSFG-rich structure, along with a number of other protoclusters with excess DSFGs and AGNs found to date, suggest that the overdensities of these rare sources indeed trace significant mass overdensities. However, it remains puzzling how these intense star formers are triggered concurrently. Although an increased probability of galaxy interactions and/or enhanced gas supply can trigger the excess of DSFGs, our stacking analysis based on 850 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m images and morphological analysis based on rest-frame optical imaging do not show such enhancements of merger fraction and gas content in this structure.},

We marginalize over spectroscopic redshift errors, and use the full velocity-dispersion likelihood function for each galaxy to make a self-consistent determination of the velocity-dispersion distribution parameters as a function of absolute magnitude and redshift, correcting as well for the effects of broadband magnitude errors on our binning. Parameterizing the distribution at each point in the luminosity-redshift plane with a log-normal form, we detect significant evolution in the width of the distribution toward higher intrinsic scatter at higher redshifts. Using a subset of deep re-observations of BOSS galaxies, we demonstrate that our distribution-parameter estimates are unbiased regardless of spectroscopic S/N. We also show through simulation that our method introduces no systematic parameter bias with redshift. We highlight the advantage of the hierarchical Bayesian method over frequentist "stacking" of spectra, and illustrate how our measured distribution parameters can be adopted as informative priors for velocity-dispersion measurements from individual noisy spectra. {\textcopyright} 2012.

We find the observatory is limited by the irreducible astrophysical backgrounds, rather than scattered stray light and thermal self-emission, for all wavelengths {\$}\backslashlambda {\textless} 12.5{\$} micron, thus meeting the level 1 requirement. This result was not assured given the open architecture and thermal challenges of JWST, and is the result of meticulous attention to stray light and thermal issues in the design, construction, integration, and test phases. From background considerations alone, JWST will require less integration time in the near-infrared compared to a system that just met the stray light requirements; as such, JWST will be even more powerful than expected for deep imaging at 1--5 micron. In the mid-infrared, the measured thermal backgrounds closely match pre-launch predictions. The background near 10 micron is slightly higher than predicted before launch, but the impact on observations is mitigated by the excellent throughput of MIRI, such that instrument sensitivity will be as good as expected pre-launch. These measured background levels are fully compatible with JWST's science goals and the Cycle 1 science program currently underway.},

abstract = {Local galaxies are known to broadly follow a bimodal distribution: actively star forming and quiescent system (i.e. galaxies with no or negligible star formation activity at the epoch of observation). Why, when and how such bimodality was established, and whether it has been associated with different processes at different cosmic epochs, is still a key open question in extragalactic astrophysics. Directly observing early quiescent galaxies in the primordial Universe is therefore of utmost importance to constraining models of galaxy formation and transformation. Early quiescent galaxies have been identified out to redshift {\$}z {\textless} 5{\$}, and these are all found to be massive ({\$}M{\_}{\{}*{\}}{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}{\~{}}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}).

The JWST/NIRSpec spectrum of this galaxy from our JADES programme exhibits a complete absence of nebular emission lines, while the Balmer break and Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} drop are unambiguously detected. We infer that this galaxy experienced a short and intense burst of star formation followed by rapid quenching, about 10-20 Myr before the epoch of observation. Particularly interesting is that the mass of this quiescent galaxy is only {\$}\backslashsim{\$}4-6{\$}\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}8{\~{}}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}. This mass range is sensitive to various feedback mechanisms that can result in temporary or permanent quiescence. Therefore this galaxy represents a unique opportunity to learn more about galaxy formation and transformation in the early Universe.},

abstract = {We investigate the impact of local environment on the galaxy stellar mass function (SMF) spanning a wide range of galaxy densities from the field up to dense cores of massive galaxy clusters. Data are drawn from a sample of eight fields from the Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large-Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey. Deep photometry allow us to select mass-complete samples of galaxies down to 10{\^{}}9 Msol. Taking advantage of {\textgreater}4000 secure spectroscopic redshifts from ORELSE and precise photometric redshifts, we construct 3-dimensional density maps between 0.55{\textless}z{\textless}1.3 using a Voronoi tessellation approach. We find that the shape of the SMF depends strongly on local environment exhibited by a smooth, continual increase in the relative numbers of high- to low-mass galaxies towards denser environments. A straightforward implication is that local environment proportionally increases the efficiency of (a) destroying lower-mass galaxies and/or (b) growth of higher-mass galaxies. We also find a presence of this environmental dependence in the SMFs of star-forming and quiescent galaxies, although not quite as strongly for the quiescent subsample. To characterize the connection between the SMF of field galaxies and that of denser environments we devise a simple semi-empirical model. The model begins with a sample of {\~{}}10{\^{}}6 galaxies at z{\_}start=5 with stellar masses distributed according to the field. Simulated galaxies then evolve down to z{\_}final=0.8 following empirical prescriptions for star-formation, quenching, and galaxy-galaxy merging. We run the simulation multiple times, testing a variety of scenarios with differing overall amounts of merging. Our model suggests that a large number of mergers are required to reproduce the SMF in dense environments. Additionally, a large majority of these mergers would have to occur in intermediate density environments (e.g. galaxy groups).},

This pilot project studies the star formation history and the physical properties of the molecular gas and dust content of the highest redshift galaxies identified through the benefits of gravitational magnification. We robustly detect dust continuum emission for the full sample and CO emission lines for three of the targets. We find that one source shows spectroscopic multiplicity and is a blend of three galaxies at different redshifts (z=2.040, 3.252 and 4.680), reminiscent of previous high-resolution imaging follow-up of unlensed submillimetre galaxies, but with a completely different search method, that confirm recent theoretical predictions of physically unassociated blended galaxies. Identifying the detected lines as 12CO (J{\_}up=2-5) we derive spectroscopic redshifts, molecular gas masses, and dust masses from the continuum emission. The mean H{\_}2 gas mass of the full sample is (2.0 +- 0.2) x 10{\^{}}11 M{\_}sun/$\backslash$mu, and the mean dust mass is (2.0+-0.2) x 10{\^{}}9 M{\_}sun/$\backslash$mu, where $\backslash$mu=2-5 is the expected lens amplification. Using these independent estimations we infer a gas-to-dust ratio of $\backslash$delta{\_}GDR=55-75, in agreement with other measurements of submillimetre galaxies. Our magnified high-luminosity galaxies fall on the same locus as other high-redshift submillimetre galaxies, extending the L'{\_}CO - L{\_}FIR correlation observed for local luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies to higher FIR and CO luminosities.},

abstract = {The unidentified infrared emission features (UIR bands) are attributed to a collection of partially hydrogenated, positively charged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This assignment is based on a spectroscopic analysis of the UIR bands. Comparison of the observed interstellar 6.2 and 7.7-micron bands with the laboratory measured Raman spectrum of a collection of carbon-based particulates (auto exhaust) shows a very good agreement, supporting this identification. The infrared emission is due to relaxation from highly vibrationally and electronically excited states. The excitation is probably caused by UV photon absorption. The infrared fluorescence of one particular, highly vibrationally excited PAH (chrysene) is modeled. In this analysis the species is treated as a molecule rather than bulk material and the non-thermodynamic equilibrium nature of the emission is fully taken into account. From a comparison of the observed ratio of the 3.3 to 11.3-micron UIR bands with the model calculations, the average number of carbon atoms per molecule is estimated to be about 20. The abundance of interstellar PAHs is calculated to be about 2 x 10 to the -7th with respect to hydrogen.},

abstract = {We apply the spectral energy distribution-fitting code ProSpect to multiwavelength imaging for {\$}\backslashsim{\$}7,000 galaxies from the GAMA survey at {\$}z{\textless}0.06{\$}, in order to extract their star-formation histories. We combine a parametric description of the star formation history with a closed-box evolution of metallicity where the present-day gas-phase metallicity of the galaxy is a free parameter. We show with this approach that we are able to recover the observationally-determined cosmic star formation history (CSFH), an indication that stars are being formed in the correct epoch of the Universe, on average, for the manner in which we are conducting SED fitting. We also show the contribution to the CSFH of galaxies of different present-day visual morphologies, and stellar masses. This analysis suggests that half of the mass in present-day elliptical galaxies was in place 11 Gyr ago, whereas in other morphological types the stellar mass formed later, up to 6 Gyr ago for present-day irregular galaxies. Similarly, the most massive galaxies in our sample were shown to have formed half their stellar mass by 10.5 Gyr ago, whereas the least massive galaxies formed half their stellar mass as late as 4 Gyr ago (the well-known effect of "galaxy downsizing"). Finally, our metallicity approach allows us to follow the average evolution in gas-phase metallicity for populations of galaxies, and extract the evolution of the cosmic metal mass density in stars and in gas, producing results in broad agreement with observations of metal densities in the Universe.},

abstract = {We study the growth of massive galaxies from z=2 to the present using data from the NEWFIRM Medium Band Survey. The sample is selected at a constant number density of n=2x10{\^{}}-4 Mpc{\^{}}-3, so that galaxies at different epochs can be compared in a meaningful way. We show that the stellar mass of galaxies at this number density has increased by a factor of {\~{}}2 since z=2, following the relation log(M)=11.45-0.15z. In order to determine at what physical radii this mass growth occurred we construct very deep stacked rest-frame R-band images at redshifts z=0.6, 1.1, 1.6, and 2.0. These image stacks of typically 70-80 galaxies enable us to characterize the stellar distribution to surface brightness limits of {\~{}}28.5 mag/arcsec{\^{}}2. We find that massive galaxies gradually built up their outer regions over the past 10 Gyr. The mass within a radius of r=5 kpc is nearly constant with redshift whereas the mass at 5-75 kpc has increased by a factor of {\~{}}4 since z=2. Parameterizing the surface brightness profiles we find that the effective radius and Sersic n parameter evolve as r{\_}e{\~{}}(1+z){\^{}}-1.3 and n{\~{}}(1+z){\^{}}-1.0 respectively. The data demonstrate that massive galaxies have grown mostly inside-out, assembling their extended stellar halos around compact, dense cores with possibly exponential radial density distributions. Comparing the observed mass evolution to the average star formation rates of the galaxies we find that the growth is likely dominated by mergers, as in-situ star formation can only account for {\~{}}20{\%} of the mass build-up from z=2 to z=0. The main uncertainties in this study are possible redshift-dependent systematic errors in the total stellar masses and the conversion from light-weighted to mass-weighted radial profiles.},

abstract = {We present new measurements of the clustering of stellar mass-complete samples of {\$}\backslashsim40,000{\$} SDSS galaxies at {\$}z\backslashsim0.03{\$} as a joint function of stellar mass and specific star formation rate (sSFR). Our results confirm what Coil et al. (2017) find at {\$}z\backslashsim0.7{\$}: galaxy clustering is a stronger function of sSFR at fixed stellar mass than of stellar mass at fixed sSFR. We also find that galaxies above the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) with higher sSFR are less clustered than galaxies below the SFMS with lower sSFR, at a given stellar mass. A similar trend is present for quiescent galaxies. This confirms that main sequence scatter, and scatter within the quiescent sequence, is physically connected to the large-scale cosmic density field. We compare the resulting galaxy bias versus sSFR, and relative bias versus sSFR ratio, for different galaxy samples across {\$}{\{}0{\textless}z{\textless}1.2{\}}{\$} to mock galaxy catalogs based on the empirical galaxy evolution model of Behroozi et al. (2019). This model fits PRIMUS and DEEP2 clustering data well at intermediate redshift, but agreement with SDSS is not as strong. We show that increasing the correlation between galaxy SFR and halo accretion rate at {\$}z\backslashsim0{\$} in the model substantially improves agreement with SDSS data. Mock catalogs suggest that central galaxies contribute substantially to the dependence of clustering on sSFR at a given stellar mass and that the signal is not simply an effect of satellite galaxy fraction differences with sSFR. Our results are highly constraining for galaxy evolution models and show that the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) depends on sSFR.},

Results: Measurements of the intrinsic sizes of the different CO emission lines indicate that the higher J transitions trace more compact regions in the galaxy. Similarly, we find smaller dust continuum intrinsic sizes with decreasing wavelength, based on observations at rest-frame 130, 300 and 450{\$}\backslashmu{\$}m. The source shows significant velocity structure, and clear asymmetry where an elongated structure is observed in the source plane with significant variations in their reconstructed sizes. This could be attributed to a compact merger or turbulent disk rotation. The differences in velocity structure through the different line tracers, however, hint at the former scenario in agreement with previous [CII] line imaging results. Measurements of the CO line ratios and magnifications yield significant variations as a function of velocity, suggesting that modeling of the ISM using integrated values could be misinterpreted. Modeling of the ISM in SPT0346-52 based on delensed fluxes indicate a highly dense and warm medium, qualitatively similar to that observed in high redshift quasar hosts.},

On Earth, plant behaviour, physiology and metabolism are sculpted around the night-day cycle by an endogenous biological circadian clock. The evolution of life was influenced by the Earth-Sun orbital dynamic, which generates the photo-environment incident on the planetary surface. In this work the unusual photo-environment of an Earth-like planet (ELP) in 3:2 spin orbit resonance is explored. Photo-environments on the ELP are longitudinally differentiated, in addition to differentiations relating to latitude and depth (for aquatic organisms) which are familiar on Earth. The light environment on such a planet could be compatible with Earth's photosynthetic life although the threat of atmospheric freeze-out and prolonged periods of darkness would present significant challenges. We emphasise the relationship between the evolution of life on a planetary body with its orbital dynamics.},

abstract = {The vast majority of dwarf satellites orbiting the Milky Way and M31 are quenched, while comparable galaxies in the field are gas-rich and star-forming. Assuming that this dichotomy is driven by environmental quenching, we use the ELVIS suite of N-body simulations to constrain the characteristic timescale upon which satellites must quench following infall into the virial volumes of their hosts. The high satellite quenched fraction observed in the Local Group demands an extremely short quenching timescale ({\~{}} 2 Gyr) for dwarf satellites in the mass range Mstar {\~{}} 10{\^{}}6-10{\^{}}8 Msun. This quenching timescale is significantly shorter than that required to explain the quenched fraction of more massive satellites ({\~{}} 8 Gyr), both in the Local Group and in more massive host halos, suggesting a dramatic change in the dominant satellite quenching mechanism at Mstar {\textless} 10{\^{}}8 Msun. Combining our work with the results of complementary analyses in the literature, we conclude that the suppression of star formation in massive satellites (Mstar {\~{}} 10{\^{}}8 - 10{\^{}}11 Msun) is broadly consistent with being driven by starvation, such that the satellite quenching timescale corresponds to the cold gas depletion time. Below a critical stellar mass scale of {\~{}} 10{\^{}}8 Msun, however, the required quenching times are much shorter than the expected cold gas depletion times. Instead, quenching must act on a timescale comparable to the dynamical time of the host halo. We posit that ram-pressure stripping can naturally explain this behavior, with the critical mass (of Mstar {\~{}} 10{\^{}}8 Msun) corresponding to halos with gravitational restoring forces that are too weak to overcome the drag force encountered when moving through an extended, hot circumgalactic medium.},

The goal of the survey is to examine a statistical sample of dynamically active clusters and large-scale structures in order to quantify galaxy properties over the full range of local and global environments. We describe the survey design, the cluster sample, and our extensive observational data covering at least 25′ around each target cluster. We use adaptively smoothed red galaxy density maps from our wide-field optical imaging to identify candidate groups/clusters and intermediate-density large-scale filaments/walls in each cluster field. Because photometric techniques (such as photometric redshifts, statistical overdensities, and richness estimates) can be highly uncertain, the crucial component of this survey is the unprecedented amount of spectroscopic coverage. We are using the wide-field, multiobject spectroscopic capabilities of the Deep Multiobject Imaging Spectrograph to obtain 100-200+ confirmed cluster members in each field. Our survey has already discovered the Cl 1604 supercluster at z ≈ 0.9, a structure which contains at least eight groups and clusters and spans 13 Mpc × 100 Mpc. Here, we present the results on the large-scale environments of two additional clusters, Cl 0023+0423 at z = 0.84 and RX J1821.6+6827 at z = 0.82, which highlight the diversity of global properties at these redshifts. The optically selected Cl 0023+0423 is a four-way group-group merger with constituent groups having measured velocity dispersions between 206 and 479 km s-1. The galaxy population is dominated by blue, star-forming galaxies, with 80{\%} of the confirmed members showing [O II] emission. The strength of the H$\delta$ line in a composite spectrum of 138 members indicates a substantial contribution from recent starbursts to the overall galaxy population. In contrast, the X-ray-selected RX J1821.6+6827 is a largely isolated, massive cluster with a measured velocity dispersion of 926 ± 77 km s-1. The cluster exhibits a well-defined red sequence with a large quiescent galaxy population. The results from these two targets, along with preliminary findings on other ORELSE clusters, suggest that optical selection may be more effective than X-ray surveys at detecting less-evolved, dynamically active systems at these redshifts. {\textcopyright} 2009.

abstract = {We study the relation between the UV-slope, {\$}\backslashbeta{\$}, and the ratio between the IR and UV luminosities of galaxies, IRX, using TNG50, the latest installment of the IllustrisTNG galaxy formation simulations. We select 7280 TNG50 star-forming galaxies with stellar mass above {\$}10{\^{}}9M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} at selected redshifts, {\$}0 \backslashleq z \backslashleq 4{\$}, and perform radiative transfer calculations with SKIRT to model the effects of ISM dust on the simulated stellar light. We adopt a Milky Way (MW) type dust and a fixed dust-to-metal ratio of 0.3 throughout and find that TNG50 star-forming main-sequence galaxies agree with the empirically-derived reference IRX-{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} relations at {\$}z \backslashlesssim 1{\$}. There appears to be a redshift-dependent systematic offset with respect to the reference relations, with the TNG50 IRX-{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} median relation steepening towards higher redshifts. This is to first order driven by variations in intrinsic UV-slopes due to different star-formation histories of galaxies selected at different cosmic epochs. Once differences in the intrinsic UV-slope are corrected for, TNG50 galaxies exhibit a scatter of 0.3 dex in IRX at fixed {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} at all studied redshifts. These galaxy-to-galaxy variations are correlated with intrinsic galaxy properties, such that at fixed UV-slope galaxies with higher star--formation rates, star--formation efficiencies, gas metallicities, and stellar masses exhibit larger IRX values. We additionally demonstrate a degeneracy between stellar age and dust type. The combination of young stellar population age with a SMC type of dust for high-redshift ({\$}z=4{\$}) TNG50 galaxies can result in an IRX-{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} relation similar to what is found for low-redshift galaxies with MW dust. This hampers the use of the IRX-{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} relation as a proxy for dust type. We provide a redshift-dependent fitting function for the IRX-{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} relation with MW dust based on our numerical models.},

abstract = {Using very deep Spitzer/MIPS 24 micron observations, we present an analysis of the bolometric luminosities (L[bol]) and UV extinction properties of more than 200 spectroscopically identified, optically selected (UGR) z{\~{}}2 galaxies in the GOODS-N field. The large spectroscopic sample is supplemented with near-IR selected (BzK/DRG) galaxies and submm sources at similar redshifts in the same field, providing a representative collection of relatively massive (M*{\textgreater}1e10 Msun) galaxies at high redshifts. We focus on the redshift range 1.5-2.6, where MIPS is sensitive to the strength of the mid-IR PAH features in the galaxy spectra (rest-frame 5-8.5 micron). We demonstrate, using stacked X-ray data and a subset of galaxies with H-alpha measurements, that L(5-8.5) provides a reliable estimate of L(IR) for most star forming galaxies at z{\~{}}2. The range of L(IR) in the samples considered extends from {\~{}}1e10 to {\textgreater}1e12 Lsun, with a mean of 2e11 Lsun. Using 24 micron observations to infer dust extinction in high redshift galaxies, we find that, as in the local universe, the obscuration (L[IR]/L[1600]) is strongly dependent on L(bol), and ranges in value from {\textless}1 to $\backslash${\~{}}1000. However, the obscuration is {\~{}}10 times smaller at a given L(bol) at z{\~{}}2 than at z=0. We show that the values of L(IR) and obscuration inferred from the UV spectral slope beta generally agree well with the values inferred from L(5-8.5) for L(bol){\textless}1e12 Lsun. For galaxies with L(bol){\textgreater}1e12 Lsun, it is common for UV-based estimates to underpredict L(IR) by a factor of {\~{}}10-100. Using the specific SFR as a proxy for cold gas fraction, we find a wide range in the evolutionary state of galaxies at z{\~{}}2, from those which have just begun to form stars to those which have already accumulated most of their stellar mass and are about to become, or already are, passively-evolving.

abstract = {We compile observations of molecular gas contents and infrared-based star formation rates (SFRs) for 112 circumnuclear star forming regions, in order to re-investigate the form of the disk-averaged Schmidt surface density star formation law in starbursts. We then combine these results with total gas and SFR surface densities for 153 nearby non-starbursting disk galaxies from de los Reyes $\backslash${\&} Kennicutt (2019), to investigate the properties of the combined star formation law, following Kennicutt (1998; K98). We confirm that the combined Schmidt law can be fitted with a single power law with slope {\$}n = 1.5\backslashpm0.05{\$} (including fitting method uncertainties), somewhat steeper than the value {\$}n = 1.4\backslashpm0.15{\$} found by K98. Fitting separate power laws to the non-starbursting and starburst galaxies, however, produces very different slopes ({\$}n = 1.34\backslashpm0.07{\$} and {\$}0.98\backslashpm0.07{\$}, respectively), with a pronounced offset in the zeropoint ({\$}\backslashsim{\$}0.6$\backslash$,dex) of the starburst relation to higher SFR surface densities. This offset is seen even when a common conversion factor between CO intensity and molecular hydrogen surface density is applied, and is confirmed when disk surface densities of interstellar dust are used as proxies for gas measurements. Tests for possible systematic biases in the starburst data fail to uncover any spurious sources for such a large offset. We tentatively conclude that the global Schmidt law in galaxies, at least as it is conventionally measured, is bimodal or possibly multi-modal. Possible causes may include changes in the small-scale structure of the molecular ISM or the stellar initial mass function. A single {\$}n \backslashsim 1.5{\$} power law still remains as a credible approximation or "recipe" for analytical or numerical models of galaxy formation and evolution.},

abstract = {We report Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic Origins Spectrograph observations of the Ly$\alpha$ emission and interstellar absorption lines in a sample of 10 star-forming galaxies at z ∼ 0.2. Selected on the basis of high equivalent width optical emission lines, the sample, dubbed “Green Peas,” make some of the best analogs for young galaxies in an early universe. We detect Ly$\alpha$ emission in all ten galaxies, and 9/10 show double-peaked line profiles suggestive of low H i column density. We measure Ly$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ flux ratios of 0.5–5.6, implying that 5{\%}–60{\%} of Ly$\alpha$ photons escape the galaxies. These data confirm previous findings that low-ionization metal absorption (LIS) lines are weaker when Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction and equivalent width are higher. However, contrary to previously favored interpretations of this trend, increased Ly$\alpha$ output cannot be the result of a varying H i covering: the Lyman absorption lines (Ly$\beta$ and higher) show a covering fraction near unity for gas with NH i ≳ 1016 cm‑2. Moreover, we detect no correlation between Ly$\alpha$ escape and the outflow velocity of the LIS lines, suggesting that kinematic effects do not explain the range of Ly$\alpha$/H$\alpha$ flux ratios in these galaxies. In contrast, we detect a strong anticorrelation between the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction and the velocity separation of the Ly$\alpha$ emission peaks, driven primarily by the velocity of the blue peak. As this velocity separation is sensitive to H i column density, we conclude that Ly$\alpha$ escape in these Green Peas is likely regulated by the H i column density rather than outflow velocity or H i covering fraction.

We perform a comprehensive analysis of five {\$}5{\textless}z{\textless}9{\$} galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from NIRSpec observations. We perform spatially resolved SED fitting with BAGPIPES, using NIRCam imaging in 6 bands spanning the wavelength range {\$}0.8-5\backslashmu{\$}m. We produce maps of the inferred physical properties by using a novel approach in the study of high redshift galaxies. This method allows us to study the internal structure and assembly of the first generations of galaxies. We find clear gradients both in the empirical colour maps, as well as in most of the estimated physical parameters. We find regions of considerably different specific star formation rates across each galaxy, which points to very bursty star-formation happening on small scales, not galaxy-wide. The integrated light is dominated by these bursty regions, which exhibit strong line emission detected by NIRSpec and also inferred from the broad-band NIRCam images, with the equivalent width of [OIII]+H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} reaching up to {\$}\backslashsim3000-4000{\$}$\backslash$AA rest-frame in these regions. Studying these galaxies in an integrated approach yields extremely young inferred ages of the stellar population ({\$}{\textless}{\$}10 Myr), which outshine older stellar populations that are only distinguishable in the spatially resolved maps. This leads to inferring {\$}\backslashsim0.5-1{\$} dex lower stellar masses by using aperture photometry, when compared to resolved analyses. Such systematics would have strong implications in the shape and evolution of the stellar mass function at these early times, particularly while samples are limited to small numbers of the brightest candidates. Furthermore, the evolved stellar populations revealed in this study imply an extended process of early galaxy formation that could otherwise be hidden behind the light of the most recently formed stars.},

abstract = {The measured star-formation rates (SFRs) of galaxies comprise an important constraint on galaxy evolution and also on their cosmological boundary conditions. Any available tracer of the SFR depends on the shape of the mass-distribution of formed stars, i.e. on the stellar initial mass function (IMF). The luminous massive stars dominate the observed photon flux while the dim low-mass stars dominate the mass in the freshly formed population. Errors in the number ratio of the massive to low-mass stars lead to errors in SFR measurements and thus to errors concerning the gas-accretion-rates and the gas-consumption time-scales of galaxies. The stellar IMF has traditionally been interpreted to be a scale-invariant probability density distribution function (PDF), but it may instead be an optimal distribution function. In the PDF interpretation, the stellar IMF observed on the stales of individual star clusters is equal to the galaxy-wide IMF (gwIMF) which, by implication, would be invariant. In this Chapter we discuss the fundamental properties of the IMF and of the gwIMF, the nature of both and their systematic variability as indicated by measurements and theoretical expectations, and we discuss the implications for the SFRs of galaxies and their main sequence. The importance of the putative most-massive-star-mass vs stellar-mass-of-the-hosting-embedded-cluster (mmax-Mecl) relation and its possible establishment during the proto-stellar formation phase, is emphasised.},

Moreover, they were unable to track the small-scale evolution of gas and stars to the present epoch within a representative portion of the Universe. Here we report a simulation that starts 12 million years after the Big Bang, and traces 13 billion years of cosmic evolution with 12 billion resolution elements in a cube of 106.5{\^{a}} ‰megaparsecs a side. It yields a reasonable population of ellipticals and spirals, reproduces the observed distribution of galaxies in clusters and characteristics of hydrogen on large scales, and at the same time matches the ' metal' and hydrogen content of galaxies on small scales. {\textcopyright} 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

We find 37 EROs in the CEERS field with F444W {\$}{\textless}28{\$} mag and photometric redshifts between {\$}5{\textless}z{\textless}7{\$}, with median {\$}z=6.9{\^{}}{\{}+1.0{\}}{\_}{\{}-1.6{\}}{\$}.

Moreover, all these EROs are unresolved, point-like sources in all NIRCam bands. We analyze the spectral energy distributions of 8 of them with MIRI and NIRSpec observations using stellar population models and AGN templates. We find that a dusty galaxy or an obscured AGN provide similarly good SED fits but different stellar properties: massive and dusty, log M/M{\_}sun{\$}\backslashsim{\$}10 and A{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm V{\}}\backslashgtrsim3{\$} mag, or low mass and obscuration, log M/M{\_}sun{\$}\backslashsim{\$}7.5 and A{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm V{\}}\backslashsim0{\$} mag, hosting an obscured QSO. SED modeling does not favor either scenario, but their unresolved sizes are more suggestive of an AGN. If any EROs are confirmed to have log M/M{\_}sun{\$}\backslashgtrsim10.5{\$}, it would increase pre-JWST number densities at {\$}z{\textgreater}7{\$} by up to a factor {\$}\backslashsim{\$}60.

abstract = {We examine recent evidence from the luminosity-redshift relation of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) for the {\$}\backslashsim 3 \backslashsigma{\$} detection of a ``Hubble bubble'' -- a departure of the local value of the Hubble constant from its globally averaged value $\backslash$citep{\{}Jha:07{\}}. By comparing the MLCS2k2 fits used in that study to the results from other light-curve fitters applied to the same data, we demonstrate that this is related to the interpretation of SN color excesses (after correction for a light-curve shape-color relation) and the presence of a color gradient across the local sample. If the slope of the linear relation ({\$}\backslashbeta{\$}) between SN color excess and luminosity is fit empirically, then the bubble disappears. If, on the other hand, the color excess arises purely from Milky Way-like dust, then SN data clearly favors a Hubble bubble. We demonstrate that SN data give {\$}\backslashbeta \backslashsimeq 2{\$}, instead of the {\$}\backslashbeta \backslashsimeq 4{\$} one would expect from purely Milky-Way-like dust. This suggests that either SN intrinsic colors are more complicated than can be described with a single light-curve shape parameter, or that dust around SN is unusual. Disentangling these possibilities is both a challenge and an opportunity for large-survey SN Ia cosmology.},

abstract = {We report observations of three gravitationally lensed supernovae (SNe) in the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) Multi-Cycle Treasury program. These objects, SN CLO12Car (z = 1.28), SN CLN12Did (z = 0.85), and SN CLA11Tib (z = 1.14), are located behind three different clusters, MACSJ1720.2+3536 (z = 0.391), RXJ1532.9+3021 (z = 0.345), and Abell 383 (z = 0.187), respectively. Each SN was detected in Hubble Space Telescope (HST) optical and infrared images. Based on photometric classification, we find that SNe CLO12Car and CLN12Did are likely to be Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), while SN CLA11Tib is probably a core-collapse SN. Using multi-color light-curve fits to determine a standardized SN Ia luminosity distance, we infer that SN CLO12Car was approximately 1.0 +/- 0.2 mag brighter than field SNe Ia at a similar redshift and ascribe this to gravitational lens magnification. Similarly, SN CLN12Did is approximately 0.2 +/- 0.2 mag brighter than field SNe Ia. We derive independent estimates of the predicted magnification from CLASH strong+weak lensing maps of the clusters: 0.83 +/- 0.16 mag for SN CLO12Car, 0.28 +/- 0.08 mag for SN CLN12Did, and 0.43 +/- 0.11 mag for SN CLA11Tib. The two SNe Ia provide a new test of the cluster lens model predictions: we find that the magnifications based on the SN Ia brightness and those predicted by the lens maps are consistent. Our results herald the promise of future observations of samples of cluster-lensed SNe Ia (from the ground or space) to help illuminate the dark-matter distribution in clusters of galaxies, through the direct determination of absolute magnifications.},

abstract = {Massive clusters of galaxies have been found that date from as early as 3.9 billion years (3.9 Gyr; z = 1.62) after the Big Bang, containing stars that formed at even earlier epochs. Cosmological simulations using the current cold dark matter model predict that these systems should descend from 'protoclusters'-early overdensities of massive galaxies that merge hierarchically to form a cluster. These protocluster regions themselves are built up hierarchically and so are expected to contain extremely massive galaxies that can be observed as luminous quasars and starbursts. Observational evidence for this picture, however, is sparse because high-redshift protoclusters are rare and difficult to observe. Here we report a protocluster region that dates from 1 Gyr (z = 5.3) after the Big Bang. This cluster of massive galaxies extends over more than 13 megaparsecs and contains a luminous quasar as well as a system rich in molecular gas. These massive galaxies place a lower limit of more than 4 × 10(11) solar masses of dark and luminous matter in this region, consistent with that expected from cosmological simulations for the earliest galaxy clusters.},

abstract = {It is common practice to speak of a " green valley " that hosts galaxies whose colors are intermediate relative to those in the " blue cloud " and the " red sequence. " In this study, we raise several questions about how galaxies might transition between the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) and varying " degrees of quiescence " from z = 3 to z ∼ 0. We develop a physically and statistically motivated definition of " transition galaxies " based on their uniquely intermediate specific star formation rates, which re-lieves ambiguities associated with color-based selections and allows us to more cleanly compare observations to theoretical models. Our analysis is focused on galaxies with stellar mass M * {\textgreater} 10 10 M , and is enabled by GAMA and CANDELS observations, a semi-analytic model (SAM) of galaxy formation, and a hydrodynamical simulation with state-of-the-art mechanical AGN feedback. In both the observations and the SAM, transition galaxies tend to have intermediate S{\'{e}}rsic indices, half-light radii, and surface stellar mass densities compared to star-forming and quiescent galaxies. We place an observational upper limit on the average population transition timescale as a function of redshift, finding that the average high-redshift galaxy is on a " fast track " for quenching (∼ 0.8 Gyr at z ∼ 2.5) whereas the average low-redshift galaxy is on a " slow track " for quenching (∼ 7 Gyr at z ∼ 0.5). We identify four dominant evo-lutionary modes for star formation histories in the SAM: oscillations on the SFMS, slow quenching, fast quenching, and rejuvenation. Quenching timescales in both the SAM and the hydrodynamical simulation are not fast enough to reproduce the heavily quiescent population that we observe at z ∼ 3. In the SAM, we do not find a clear-cut morphological dependence of quenching timescales, but we do predict that the mean stellar ages, cold gas fractions, SMBH masses, and halo masses of transition galaxies tend to be intermediate relative to those of star-forming and quiescent galaxies at z {\textless} 3.},

abstract = {Almost every helium atom in the Universe was created just a few minutes after the Big Bang through a process commonly referred to as Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The amount of helium that was made during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis is determined by the combination of particle physics and cosmology. The current leading measures of the primordial helium abundance (Y{\_}P) are based on the relative strengths of H I and He I emission lines emanating from star-forming regions in local metal-poor galaxies. As the statistical errors on these measurements improve, it is essential to test for systematics by developing independent techniques. Here we report the first determination of the primordial helium abundance based on a near-pristine intergalactic gas cloud that is seen in absorption against the light of a background quasar. This gas cloud, observed when the Universe was just one-third of its present age (z{\_}abs = 1.724), has a metal content {\~{}}100 times less than the Sun, and {\~{}}30 per cent less metals than the most metal-poor H II region currently known where a determination of the primordial helium abundance is afforded. We conclude that the helium abundance of this intergalactic gas cloud is Y = 0.250{\^{}}{\{}+0.033{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.025{\}}, which agrees with the Standard Model primordial value, Y{\_}P = 0.24672 +/- 0.00017. Our determination of the primordial helium abundance is not yet as precise as that derived using metal-poor galaxies, but our method has the potential to offer a competitive test of physics beyond the Standard Model during Big Bang Nucleosynthesis.},

abstract = {Metal-poor globular clusters (GCs) are both numerous and ancient, which indicates that they may be important contributors to ionizing radiation in the reionization era. Starting from the observed number density and stellar mass function of old GCs at {\$}z=0{\$}, I compute the contribution of GCs to ultraviolet luminosity functions (UVLFs) in the high-redshift Universe ({\$}10 \backslashgtrsim z \backslashgtrsim 4{\$}). Even under absolutely minimal assumptions - no disruption of GCs and no reduction in GC stellar mass from early times to the present - GC star formation contributes non-negligibly to the UVLF at luminosities that are accessible to the Hubble Space Telescope (HST; {\$}M{\_}{\{}1500{\}} \backslashapprox -17{\$}). The derived GC UVLFs are Schechter-like in shape even though the underlying {\$}z=0{\$} GC stellar mass functions are log-normal; the Schechter parameters are directly related to the time evolution of UV output from a specified stellar population, evolutionary processes affecting the stellar masses of GCs, and the duration of the GC formation epoch. If the stellar masses of GCs were significantly higher in the past, as is predicted by most models explaining GC chemical anomalies, then GCs dominate the UV emission from many galaxies in existing deep-field observations. On the other hand, it is difficult to reconcile observed UVLFS with models requiring stellar masses at birth that exceed present-day stellar masses by more than a factor of 10. The James Webb Space Telescope will be able to directly detect individual GCs at {\$}z \backslashsim 6{\$} in essentially all bright galaxies, and many galaxies below the knee of the UVLF, for most of the scenarios considered here. The properties of a subset of high-{\$}z{\$} galaxies with {\$}-19 \backslashlesssim M{\_}{\{}1500{\}} \backslashlesssim -14{\$} in HST lensing fields indicate that they may actually be GCs in formation.},

@article{Cai2019,
abstract = {Recent estimates point to abundances of z {\textgreater} 4 sub-mm galaxies far above model predictions. The matter is still debated. According to some analyses the excess may be substantially lower than initially thought and perhaps accounted for by flux boosting and source blending. However, there is no general agreement on this conclusion. An excess of z {\textgreater} 6 dusty galaxies has also been reported albeit with poor statistics. On the other hand, Zhang et al. (2018) reported evidence of a top-heavy initial mass function (IMF) in high-z galaxies. This would translate into higher a sub-mm luminosity of dusty galaxies at fixed star-formation rate (SFR), i.e., into a higher abundance of high-z galaxies than expected for an universal IMF. Exploiting the physical model by Cai et al. (2013) we argue that some excess can be understood in terms of a somewhat top-heavier IMF for proto-spheroidal galaxies compared to late-type galaxies. Such IMF is consistent with that advocated by Zhang et al. (2018) to account for the low {\$}{\^{}}{\{}13{\}}{\$}C/{\$}{\^{}}{\{}18{\}}{\$}O abundance ratio measured by them in four {\$}z=2{\$}--3 dusty galaxies. However, the IMF impact on the star formation history of galaxies is far less dramatic than suggested by these authors and extreme top-heavy IMFs are inconsistent with the data.},

With a sample of 120 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members, we investigate the role of environment on galaxy properties utilizing the projected cluster phase space (line-of-sight velocity versus clustercentric radius), which probes the time-averaged galaxy density to which a galaxy has been exposed. We divide cluster galaxies into phase-space bins of r r v v 200 () () s ´ D , tracing a sequence of accretion histories in phase space. Stacking optically star-forming cluster members on the Herschel maps, we measure average infrared star formation rates, and, for the first time in high-redshift galaxy clusters, dust temperatures for dynamically distinct galaxy populations-namely, recent infalls and those that were accreted onto the cluster at an earlier epoch. Proceeding from the infalling to virialized (central) regions of phase space, we find a steady decrease in the specific star formation rate and increase in the stellar age of star-forming cluster galaxies. We perform a probability analysis to investigate all acceptable infrared spectral energy distributions within the full parameter space and measure a 4s {\~{}} drop in the average dust temperature of cluster galaxies in an intermediate phase-space bin, compared to an otherwise flat trend with phase space. We suggest one plausible quenching mechanism which may be consistent with these trends, invoking ram-pressure stripping of the warmer dust for galaxies within this intermediate accretion phase.},

We find an average scatter of {\$}0.0197\backslashpm0.0003(1+z){\$} in the Skelton et al. (2014) photometric redshifts. Photometric redshift accuracy decreases with magnitude and redshift, but does not vary monotonically with color or stellar mass.

Although the overall photometric redshift accuracy for quiescent galaxies is better than for star-forming galaxies, scatter depends more strongly on magnitude and redshift than on galaxy type.

We demonstrate that photometric redshift accuracy is strongly filter-dependent and quantify the contribution of multiple filter combinations. We evaluate the widths of redshift probability distribution functions and find that error estimates are underestimated by a factor of {\$}\backslashsim1.1-1.6{\$}, but that uniformly broadening the distribution does not adequately account for fitting outliers. Finally, we suggest possible applications of these data in planning for current and future surveys and simulate photometric redshift performance in the LSST, DES, and combined DES and VHS surveys.},

Here, we attempt to study the host and environmental properties of two relatively faint ( L 1.4 GHz ∼ 10 25 W Hz −1 ) RAGNs in a known protocluster at z = 3.3 in the PCl J0227-0421 field, detected using the latest radio observation obtained as part of the Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large-Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey. Using new spectroscopic observations obtained from the Keck/Multi-Object Spectrometer for Infra-Red Exploration as part of the Charting Cluster Construction with the VIMOS Ultra-Deep Survey (VUDS) and ORELSE (C3VO) survey and previous spectroscopic data obtained as part of the VIMOS-Very Large Telescope Deep Survey and VUDS, we revise the three-dimensional overdensity field around this protocluster. The protocluster is embedded in a large-scale overdensity protostructure. This protostructure has an estimated total mass of ∼2.6 × 10 15 M ⊙ and contains several overdensity peaks. Both RAGNs are hosted by very bright and massive galaxies, while their hosts show extreme differences in color, indicating that they are of different ages and are in different evolutionary stages. Furthermore, we find that they are not in the most locally dense parts of the protostructure, but are fairly close to the centers of their parent overdensity peaks. We propose a scenario where merging might have already happened in both cases, which lowered the local density of their surrounding area and boosted their stellar mass. This work is the first time that two RAGNs at low luminosity have been found and studied within a high-redshift protostructure.},

We measure spatially resolved star formation histories (SFHs), the time since quenching ( t  Q  ), and the fraction of stellar mass assembled in the past 1.5 Gyr ( $\mu$ 1.5 ). The SFHs display a clear enhancement of star formation prior to quenching for 16 out of 21 objects, with at least 10{\%} (and up to {\textgreater}50{\%}) of the stellar mass being assembled in the past 1.5 Gyr and t  Q  ranging from less than 100 to ∼800 Myr. By mapping t  Q  and $\mu$ 1.5 , we analyze the quenching patterns of the galaxies. Most galaxies in our sample have quenched their star formation from the outside in or show a side-to-side/irregular pattern, both consistent with quenching by ram pressure stripping. Only three objects show an inside-out quenching pattern, all of which are at the high-mass end of our sample. At least two of them currently host an active galactic nucleus. In two post-starbursts, we identify tails of ionized gas indicating that these objects had their gas stripped by ram pressure very recently. Post-starburst features are also found in the stripped regions of galaxies undergoing ram pressure stripping in the same clusters, confirming the link between these classes of objects. Our results point to ram pressure stripping as the main driver of fast quenching in these environments, with active galactic nuclei playing a role at high stellar masses. },

abstract = {We present a study of the host galaxies of active galactic nucleus (AGN) selected from the zCOSMOS survey to establish if accretion onto supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and star formation are explicitly linked up to z ∼ 1. We identify 152 galaxies that harbor AGN, based on their X-ray emission (L 0.5-10keV {\textgreater} 1042 erg s-1) detected by XMM-Newton observations of 7543 galaxies (iacs {\textless} 22.5). Star formation rates (SFRs), including those weighted by stellar mass, of a subsample are determined using the [O II] $\lambda$3727 emission-line luminosity, corrected for an AGN contribution based on the observed [O III]$\lambda$5007 strength or that inferred by their hard (2-10 keV) X-ray luminosity. We find that an overwhelming majority of AGN host galaxies have significant levels of star formation with a distribution spanning ∼ 1-100 M⊙ yr-1; their average SFR is higher than that of galaxies with equivalent stellar mass (M* {\textgreater} 4 × 1010 M⊙). The close association between AGN activity and star formation is further substantiated by an increase in the fraction of galaxies hosting AGN with the youthfulness of their stars as indicated by the rest-frame color (U-V) and spectral index Dn(4000); we demonstrate that a mass-selected sample is required to alleviate an artificial peak in the AGN fraction falling in the transition region due to the fact that many "blue cloud" galaxies have low mass-to-light ratios in luminosity-limited samples. We also find that the SFRs of AGN hosts evolve with cosmic time in a manner that closely mirrors the overall galaxy population and naturally explains the low SFRs in AGNs (z {\textgreater} 0.3) from the SDSS. We conclude that the conditions most conducive for AGN activity are a massive host galaxy and a large reservoir of gas. Furthermore, a direct correlation between mass-accretion rate onto SMBHs and SFR is shown to be weak although the average ratio (∼10 -2) is constant with redshift, effectively shifting the evidence for a co-evolution scenario in a statistical manner to smaller physical scales (i.e., within the same galaxies). The order-of-magnitude increase in this ratio compared to the locally measured value of MBH/Mbulgeis consistent with an AGN lifetime substantially shorter than that of star formation. Our findings illustrate an intermittent scenario with underlying complexities regarding fueling over vastly different physical (and temporal) scales yet to be firmly determined. {\textcopyright} 2009.

abstract = {Dust attenuation curves in external galaxies are useful to study their dust properties as well as to interpret their intrinsic spectral energy distributions. In particular the presence or absence of a UV bump at 2175 A remains an open issue which has consequences on the interpretation of broad band colours of distant galaxies. We study the dust attenuation curve in the UV range at z {\textgreater}1. In particular we search for the presence of a UV bump. We use deep photometric data of the CDFS obtained with intermediate and broad band filters by the MUSYC project to sample the UV rest-frame of galaxies with 1{\textless}z {\textless}2. Herschel/PACS and Spitzer/MIPS data are used to measure the dust emission. 30 galaxies were selected with high S/N in all bands. Their SEDs from the UV to the far-IR are fitted using the CIGALE code and the characteristics of the dust attenuation curve are obtained. The mean dust attenuation curve we derive exhibits a UV bump at 2175A whose amplitude corresponds to 35 {\%} (76{\%}) that of the MW (LMC2 supershell) extinction curve. An analytical expression of the average attenuation curve is given, it is found slightly steeper than the Calzetti et al. one, although at a 1 sigma level. Our galaxy sample is used to study the derivation of the slopes of the UV continuum from broad band colours, including the GALEX FUV-NUV colour. Systematic errors induced by the presence of the bump are quantified. We compare dust attenuation factors measured with CIGALE to the slope of the UV continuum and find that there is a large scatter around the relation valid for local starbursts (0.7 mag). The uncertainties on the determination of the UV slope lead to an extra systematic error of the order of 0.3 to 0.7 mag on dust attenuation when a filter overlaps the UV bump.},

Tracing the stellar population properties as close to their major formation epoch as possible, we try to put constraints on the star formation history, post-quenching evolution, and possible progenitor star-forming populations for such massive quenched galaxies. By using a set of Lick absorption line indices on a rest-frame optical composite spectrum, the average age, metallicity [Z/H], and $\alpha$-to-iron element abundance ratio [$\alpha$/Fe] are derived as log(age Gyr) 0.04-0.08+0.10, [Z/H] = 0.24-0.14+0.20, and [$\alpha$/Fe] = 0.31-0.12+0.12, respectively. If our sample of quenched galaxies at 〈z〉 = 1.6 is evolved passively to z = 0, their stellar population properties will align in excellent agreement with local counterparts at similar stellar velocity dispersions, which qualifies them as progenitors of local massive early-type galaxies. Redshift evolution of stellar population ages in quenched galaxies combined with low redshift measurements from the literature suggests a formation redshift of zf ∼ 2.3, around which the bulk of stars in these galaxies have been formed. The measured [$\alpha$/Fe] value indicates a star formation timescale of ≲1Gyr, which can be translated into a specific star formation rate of ≃1 Gyr-1 prior to quenching. Based on these findings, we discuss identifying possible progenitor star-forming galaxies at z ≃ 2.3. We identify normal star-forming galaxies, i.e., those on the star-forming main sequence, followed by a rapid quenching event, as likely precursors of the quenched galaxies at 〈z〉 = 1.6 presented here.},

The analysis is based on the version 2.0 HLF data release that now includes all ultraviolet (UV) imaging, combining three major UV surveys. The HLF data combines over a decade worth of 7475 exposures taken in 2635 orbits totaling 6.3 Msec with the HST Advanced Camera for Surveys Wide Field Channel (ACS/WFC) and the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) UVIS/IR Channels in the greater GOODS-S extragalactic field, covering all major observational efforts (e.g., GOODS, GEMS, CANDELS, ERS, UVUDF and many other programs; see Illingworth et al 2019, in prep). The HLF GOODS-S catalogs include photometry in 13 bandpasses from the UV (WFC3/UVIS F225W, F275W and F336W filters), optical (ACS/WFC F435W, F606W, F775W, F814W and F850LP filters), to near-infrared (WFC3/IR F098M, F105W, F125W, F140W and F160W filters). Such a data set makes it possible to construct the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of objects over a wide wavelength range from high resolution mosaics that are largely contiguous. Here, we describe a photometric analysis of 186,474 objects in the HST imaging at wavelengths 0.2--1.6{\$}\backslashmu{\$}m. We detect objects from an ultra-deep image combining the PSF-homogenized and noise-equalized F850LP, F125W, F140W and F160W images, including Gaia astrometric corrections. SEDs were determined by carefully taking the effects of the point-spread function in each observation into account.

The law depends on only one parameter R(V) = A(V)/E(B-V). An analytic formula is given for the mean extinction law which can be used to calculate color excesses or to deredden observations. The validity of the law over a large wavelength interval suggests that the processes which modify the sizes and compositions of grains are stochastic in nature and very efficient.},

abstract = {We present a simple, empirically motivated model that simultaneously predicts the evolution of the mean size and the comoving mass density of massive ({\textgreater}1011 M) early-type galaxies from z = 2 to the present. First, we demonstrate that some size evolution of the population can be expected simply due to the continuous emergence of early-type galaxies. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) data reveal that in the present-day universe more compact early-type galaxies with a given dynamical mass have older stellar populations. This implies that with increasing look-back time, the more extended galaxies will be more and more absent from the population. In contrast, at a given stellar velocity dispersion, SDSS data show that there is no relation between size and age, which implies that the velocity dispersion can be used to estimate the epoch at which galaxies stopped forming stars, turning into early-type galaxies. Based on this, we define an empirically motivated, redshift-dependent velocity dispersion threshold above which galaxies do not form stars at a significant rate, which we associate with the transformation into early-type galaxies. Applying this "formation" criterion to a large sample of nearby early-type galaxies, we predict the redshift evolution in the size distribution and the comoving mass density. The resulting evolution in the mean size is roughly half of the observed evolution. Then we include a prescription for the merger histories of galaxies between the "formation" redshift and the present, based on cosmological simulations of the assembly of dark matter halos. Such mergers after the transformation into an early-type galaxy are presumably dissipationless ("dry"), where the increase in size is expected to be approximately proportional to the increase in mass. This model successfully reproduces the observed evolution since z 2 in the mean size and in the comoving mass density of early-type galaxies with mass M {\textgreater} 10 11 M. We conclude that the recently measured, substantial size evolution of early-type galaxies can be explained by the combined effect of the continuous emergence of galaxies as early types and their subsequent growth through dry merging. {\textcopyright} 2009.

Local galaxies in this stellar mass range have been shown to have systematically shorter assembly times within their inner regions ({\textless}0.5 R50) when compared to that of the galaxy as a whole, contrary to lower or higher mass galaxies which show consistent assembly times at all radii. Hence, we refer to these galaxies as Inside-Out Assembled Galaxy (IOAG) candidates. We find that the majority of IOAG candidates with well-detected emission lines are classified as either AGN (40{\%}) or composite (40{\%}) in the BPT diagram. We also find that the majority of our sources are located below the main sequence of star formation, and within the green valley or red sequence. Most BPT-classified star-forming IOAG candidates have spiral morphologies and are in the main sequence, whereas Seyfert 2 and composites have mostly spiral morphologies but quiescent star formation rates (SFRs). We argue that a high fraction of IOAG candidates seem to be in the process of quenching, moving from the blue cloud to the red sequence. Those classified as AGN have systematically lower SFRs than star-forming galaxies suggesting that AGN activity may be related to this quenching. However, the spiral morphology of these galaxies remains in place, suggesting that the central star-formation is suppressed before the morphological transformation occurs.},

Moreover, these galaxies are commonly found to be ultra-compact with half-light radii of {\~{}}1 kpc. We have obtained a {\~{}}29 hr spectrum of a typical quiescent, ultra-dense galaxy at z=2.1865 with the Gemini Near-Infrared Spectrograph. The spectrum exhibits a strong optical break and several absorption features, which have not previously been detected in z{\textgreater}2 quiescent galaxies. Comparison of the spectral energy distribution with stellar population synthesis models implies a low star formation rate (SFR) of 1-3 Msol/yr, an age of 1.3-2.2 Gyr, and a stellar mass of {\~{}}2x10{\^{}}11 Msol. We detect several faint emission lines, with emission-line ratios of [NII]/Halpha, [SII]/Halpha and [OII]/[OIII] typical of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions. Thus, neither the stellar continuum nor the nebular emission implies active star formation. The current SFR is {\textless}1{\%} of the past average SFR. If this galaxy is representative of compact quiescent galaxies beyond z=2, it implies that quenching of star formation is extremely efficient and also indicates that low luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) could be common in these objects. Nuclear emission is a potential concern for the size measurement. However, we show that the AGN contributes {\textless}8{\%} to the rest-frame optical emission. A possible post-starburst population may affect size measurements more strongly; although a 0.5 Gyr old stellar population can make up {\textless}10{\%} of the total stellar mass, it could account for up to {\~{}}40{\%} of the optical light. Nevertheless, this spectrum shows that this compact galaxy is dominated by an evolved stellar population.},

We present and release photometric redshifts for a uniquely large and deep sample of 522286 objects with i′AB ≤25 in the Canada-France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) "Deep Survey" fields D1, D2, D3, and D4, which cover a total effective area of 3.2 deg 2. Methods. We use 3241 spectroscopic redshifts with 0 ≤ z ≤ 5 from the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS) as a calibration and training set to derive these photometric redshifts. Using the "Le Phare" photometric redshift code, we developed a robust calibration method based on an iterative zero-point refinement combined with a template optimisation procedure and the application of a Bayesian approach. This method removes systematic trends in the photometric redshifts and significantly reduces the fraction of catastrophic errors (by a factor of 2), a significant improvement over traditional methods. We use our unique spectroscopic sample to present a detailed assessment of the robustness of the photometric redshift sample. Results. For a sample selected at i′AB ≤24, we reach a redshift accuracy of $\sigma$$\Delta$z/(1+z)= 0.029 with $\eta$ = 3.8{\%} of catastrophic errors ($\eta$ is defined strictly as those objects with |$\Delta$z|/(1 + z) {\textgreater} 0.15). The reliability of our photometric redshifts decreases for faint objects: we find $\sigma$$\Delta$z/(1+z) = 0.025,0.034 and $\eta$ = 1.9{\%}, 5.5{\%} for samples selected at i′AB = 17.5-22.5 and 22.5-24 respectively. We find that the photometric redshifts of starburst galaxies are less reliable: although these galaxies represent only 22{\%} of the spectroscopic sample, they are responsible for 50{\%} of the catastrophic errors. An analysis as a function of redshift demonstrates that our photometric redshifts work best in the redshift range 0.2 ≤; z ≤ 1.5. We find an excellent agreement between the photometric and the VVDS spectroscopic redshift distributions at i′AB ≤ 24. Finally, we compare the redshift distributions of i′ selected galaxies on the four CFHTLS deep fields, showing that cosmic variance is still present on fields of 0.7-0.9 deg2.

abstract = {We investigate the properties of galaxies as they shut off star formation over the 4 billion years surrounding peak cosmic star formation. To do this we categorize {\$}\backslashsim7000{\$} galaxies from {\$}1{\textless}z{\textless}4{\$} into {\$}90{\$} groups based on the shape of their spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and build composite SEDs with {\$}R\backslashsim 50{\$} resolution. These composite SEDs show a variety of spectral shapes and also show trends in parameters such as color, mass, star formation rate, and emission line equivalent width. Using emission line equivalent widths and strength of the 4000$\backslash$AA$\backslash$ break, {\$}D(4000){\$}, we categorize the composite SEDs into five classes: extreme emission line, star-forming, transitioning, post-starburst, and quiescent galaxies. The transitioning population of galaxies show modest H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emission ({\$}EW{\_}{\{}\backslashrm REST{\}}\backslashsim40{\$}$\backslash$AA) compared to more typical star-forming composite SEDs at {\$}\backslashlog{\_}{\{}10{\}}(M/M{\_}\backslashodot)\backslashsim10.5{\$} ({\$}EW{\_}{\{}\backslashrm REST{\}}\backslashsim80{\$}$\backslash$AA). Together with their smaller sizes (3 kpc vs. 4 kpc) and higher S$\backslash$'ersic indices (2.7 vs. 1.5), this indicates that morphological changes initiate before the cessation of star formation. The transitional group shows a strong increase of over one dex in number density from {\$}z\backslashsim3{\$} to {\$}z\backslashsim1{\$}, similar to the growth in the quiescent population, while post-starburst galaxies become rarer at {\$}z\backslashlesssim1.5{\$}. We calculate average quenching timescales of 1.6 Gyr at {\$}z\backslashsim1.5{\$} and 0.9 Gyr at {\$}z\backslashsim2.5{\$} and conclude that a fast quenching mechanism producing post-starbursts dominated the quenching of galaxies at early times, while a slower process has become more common since {\$}z\backslashsim2{\$}.},

We attribute this evolution to the evolution in the {\$}M{\_}{\{}*{\}}/L{\_}{\{}H{\_}{\{}160{\}}{\}}{\$} and colour gradient. Indeed, as expected, the ratio of mass-weighted to light-weighted size is correlated with the {\$}M{\_}{\{}*{\}}/L{\$} gradient, but is also mildly correlated with the mass surface density and mass-weighted size. The colour gradients {\$}(\backslashnabla{\_}{\{}z-H{\}}){\$} are mostly negative, with a median value of {\$}\backslashsim0.45{\$} mag dex{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}, twice the local value.

abstract = {We investigate the relationship between the star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass ({\$}M{\_}*{\$}) and molecular gas mass ({\$}M{\_}{\{}H{\_}2{\}}{\$}) for local star-forming galaxies. We further investigate these relationships for high-z (z=1-3) galaxies and for the hosts of a local sample of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We explore which of these dependencies are intrinsic and which are an indirect by-product by employing partial correlation coefficients and random forest regression. We find that for local star-forming galaxies, high-z galaxies, and AGN host galaxies, the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation (SK, between {\$}M{\_}{\{}H{\_}2{\}}{\$} and SFR), and the Molecular Gas Main Sequence (MGMS, between {\$}M{\_}{\{}H{\_}2{\}}{\$} and {\$}M{\_}*{\$}) are intrinsic primary relations, while the relationship between {\$}M{\_}*{\$} and SFR, i.e. the Star-Forming Main Sequence (SFMS), is an indirect by-product of the former two. Hence the Star-Forming Main Sequence is not a fundamental scaling relation for local or high-redshift galaxies. We find evidence for both the evolution of the MGMS and SK relation over cosmic time, where, at a given stellar mass, the higher the redshift, the greater the molecular gas mass and the star formation efficiency. We offer a parameterisation of both the MGMS and SK relation's evolution with redshift, showing how they combine to form the observed evolution of the SFMS. In addition, we find that the local AGN host galaxies follow an AGN-MGMS relation (as well as a AGN-SK relation), where the MGMS is offset to lower {\$}M{\_}{\{}H{\_}2{\}}{\$} for a given {\$}M{\_}*{\$} compared to local SF galaxies.},

The large 2-square degree survey area delivers a sample of {\$}\backslashsim400{\$} such ultra-massive systems. Accurate sizes are derived using a calibration based on high-resolution images from the Hubble Space Telescope. We find that, at these very high masses, the size evolution of star-forming and quiescent galaxies is almost indistinguishable in terms of normalization and power-law slope. We use this result to investigate possible pathways of quenching massive {\$}m{\textgreater}M{\^{}}*{\$} galaxies at {\$}z{\textless}2{\$}. We consistently model the size evolution of quiescent galaxies from the star-forming population by assuming different simple models for the suppression of star-formation. These models include an instantaneous and delayed quenching without altering the structure of galaxies and a central starburst followed by compaction. We find that instantaneous quenching reproduces well the observed mass-size relation of massive galaxies at {\$}z{\textgreater}1{\$}. Our starburst{\$}+{\$}compaction model followed by individual growth of the galaxies by minor mergers is preferred over other models without structural change for {\$}\backslashlog(m/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}){\textgreater}11.0{\$} galaxies at {\$}z{\textgreater}0.5{\$}. None of our models is able to meet the observations at {\$}m{\textgreater}M{\^{}}*{\$} and {\$}z{\textless}1{\$} with out significant contribution of post-quenching growth of individual galaxies via mergers. We conclude that quenching is a fast process in galaxies with {\$} m \backslashge 10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, and that major mergers likely play a major role in the final steps of their evolution.},

abstract = {We investigate a class of rapidly growing emission line galaxies, known as "Green Peas", first noted by volunteers in the Galaxy Zoo project because of their peculiar bright green colour and small size, unresolved in SDSS imaging. Their appearance is due to very strong optical emission lines, namely [O III] 5007 A, with an unusually large equivalent width of up to {\~{}}1000 A. We discuss a well-defined sample of 251 colour-selected objects, most of which are strongly star forming, although there are some AGN interlopers including 8 newly discovered narrow Line Seyfert 1 galaxies. The star-forming Peas are low mass galaxies (M{\~{}}10{\^{}}8.5 - 10{\^{}}10 M{\_}sun) with high star formation rates ({\~{}}10 M{\_}sun/yr), low metallicities (log[O/H] + 12 {\~{}} 8.7) and low reddening (E(B-V) {\textless} 0.25) and they reside in low density environments. They have some of the highest specific star formation rates (up to {\~{}}10{\^{}}{\{}-8{\}} yr{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}) seen in the local Universe, yielding doubling times for their stellar mass of hundreds of Myrs. The few star-forming Peas with HST imaging appear to have several clumps of bright star-forming regions and low surface density features that may indicate recent or ongoing mergers. The Peas are similar in size, mass, luminosity and metallicity to Luminous Blue Compact Galaxies. They are also similar to high redshift UV-luminous galaxies, e.g., Lyman-break galaxies and Lyman-alpha emitters, and therefore provide a local laboratory with which to study the extreme star formation processes that occur in high-redshift galaxies. Studying starbursting galaxies as a function of redshift is essential to understanding the build up of stellar mass in the Universe.},

abstract = {Measuring stellar velocity dispersions of quiescent galaxies beyond {\$}z\backslashsim2{\$} is observationally challenging. Such measurements require near-infrared spectra with a continuum detection of at least moderate signal-to-noise, often necessitating long integrations. In this paper, we present deep X-Shooter spectroscopy of one of only two known gravitationally-lensed massive quiescent galaxies at {\$}z{\textgreater}2{\$}. This galaxy is quadruply imaged, with the brightest images magnified by a factor of {\$}\backslashsim5{\$}. The total exposure time of our data is 9.8 hours on-source; however the magnification, and the slit placement encompassing 2 images, provides a total equivalent exposure time of 215 hours. From this deep spectrum we measure a redshift ({\$}z{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}spec{\}}{\}}=2.756\backslashpm0.001{\$}), making this one of the highest redshift quiescent galaxies that is spectroscopically confirmed. We simultaneously fit both the spectroscopic and photometric data to determine stellar population parameters and conclude this galaxy is relatively young, intermediate-mass, consistent with low dust content, and has quenched only relatively recently. This recent quenching is confirmed by strong Balmer absorption, particularly {\$}H\backslashdelta{\$}. Remarkably, this proves that at least some intermediate-mass galaxies have already quenched as early as {\$}z\backslashsim2.8{\$}. Additionally, we have measured a velocity dispersion ({\$}\backslashsigma=187\backslashpm43{\~{}}\backslashmathrm{\{}km/s{\}}{\$}), making this the highest-redshift quiescent galaxy with a dispersion measurement. We confirm that this galaxy falls on the same mass fundamental plane (MFP) as galaxies at z=2.2, consistent with little to no evolution in the MFP up to z=2.8. Overall this galaxy is proof of existence of intermediate-mass quenched galaxies in the distant universe, and that lensing is a powerful tool for determining their properties with improved accuracy.},

abstract = {A growing number of galaxy clusters at z = 1-2 is being discovered as part of deep optical, IR, X-ray, and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect surveys. For a complete picture of cluster formation, however, it is important that we also start probing the much earlier epoch, between redshifts of about 2 and 7, during which these clusters and their galaxies first began to form. Because the study of these so-called proto-clusters is currently quite limited by small number statistics, widely varying selection techniques, and many assumptions, we have performed a large systematic study of cluster formation utilizing cosmological simulations. We use the Millennium Simulations to track the evolution of dark matter and galaxies in about 3000 clusters from the earliest times to z = 0. We define an effective radius Re for proto-clusters and characterize their growth in size and mass with cosmic time. We show that the progenitor regions of galaxy clusters (ranging in mass from ∼1014 to a few times 1015 M *) can already be identified in galaxy surveys at very early times (at least up to z ∼ 5), provided that the galaxy overdensities are measured on a sufficiently large scale (Re ∼ 5-10 Mpc comoving) and with sufficient statistics. We present the overdensities in matter, dark matter halos, and galaxies as functions of present-day cluster mass, redshift, bias, and window size that can be used to interpret the wide range of structures found in real surveys. We also derive the probability that a structure having a galaxy overdensity $\delta$gal, defined by a set of observational selection criteria, is indeed a proto-cluster, and we show how their z = 0 masses can already be estimated long before virialization. We present overdensity profiles as a function of radius, and we further show how the projected surface overdensities of proto-clusters decrease as the uncertainties in redshift measurements increase. We provide a table of proto-cluster candidates selected from the literature and discuss their properties in light of our simulation predictions. This paper provides the general framework that will allow us to extend the study of cluster formation out to much higher redshifts using the large number of proto-clusters that are expected to be discovered in, e.g., the upcoming HETDEX and Hyper Suprime-Cam surveys. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {With just a month of data, JWST is already transforming our view of the universe, revealing and resolving starlight in unprecedented populations of galaxies. Although “HST-dark” galaxies have previously been detected at long wavelengths, these observations generally suffer from a lack of spatial resolution, which limits our ability to characterize their sizes and morphologies. Here we report on a first view of starlight from a subset of the HST-dark population that is bright with JWST/NIRCam (4.4 $\mu$ m {\textless} 24.5 mag) and very faint or even invisible with HST ({\textless}1.6 $\mu$ m). In this Letter we focus on a dramatic and unanticipated population of physically extended galaxies (≳0.″25). These 12 galaxies have photometric redshifts 2 {\textless} z {\textless} 6, high stellar masses M ⋆ ≳ 10 10 M ⊙ , and significant dust-attenuated star formation. Surprisingly, the galaxies have elongated projected axis ratios at 4.4 $\mu$ m, suggesting that the population is disk dominated or prolate and we hence refer to them as ultrared flattened objects. Most of the galaxies appear red at all radii, suggesting significant dust attenuation throughout. With R e (F444W) ∼ 1–2 kpc, the galaxies are similar in size to compact massive galaxies at z ∼ 2 and the cores of massive galaxies and S0s at z ∼ 0. The stellar masses, sizes, and morphologies of the sample suggest that some could be progenitors of lenticular or fast-rotating galaxies in the local universe. The existence of this population suggests that our previous censuses of the universe may have missed massive, dusty edge-on disks, in addition to dust-obscured starbursts.},

abstract = {In the local (redshift z{\~{}}0) Universe, collisional ring galaxies make up only {\~{}}0.01{\%} of galaxies and are formed by head-on galactic collisions that trigger radially propagating density waves. These striking systems provide key snapshots for dissecting galactic disks and are studied extensively in the local Universe. However, not much is known about distant (z{\textgreater}0.1) collisional rings. Here we present a detailed study of a ring galaxy at a look-back time of 10.8 Gyr (z=2.19). Compared with our Milky Way, this galaxy has a similar stellar mass, but has a stellar half-light radius that is 1.5-2.2 times larger and is forming stars 50 times faster. The large, diffuse stellar light outside the star-forming ring, combined with a radial velocity on the ring and an intruder galaxy nearby, provides evidence for this galaxy hosting a collisional ring. If the ring is secularly evolved, the implied large bar in a giant disk would be inconsistent with the current understanding of the earliest formation of barred spirals. Contrary to previous predictions, this work suggests that massive collisional rings were as rare 11 Gyr ago as they are today. Our discovery offers a unique pathway for studying density waves in young galaxies, as well as constraining the cosmic evolution of spiral disks and galaxy groups.},

We make use of high-redshift SN observations when training the model, allowing us to extend it bluer than rest frame U. This increases the utility of our high-redshift SN observations by allowing us to use more of the available data. We find that when the shape of the light curve is described using a stretch prescription, applying the same stretch at all wavelengths is not an adequate description. SiFTO therefore uses a generalization of stretch which applies different stretch factors as a function of both the wavelength of the observed filter and the stretch in the rest-frame B band. We compare SiFTO to other published light-curve models by applying them to the same set of SN photometry, and demonstrate that SiFTO and SALT2 perform better than the alternatives when judged by the scatter around the best fit luminosity distance relationship. We further demonstrate that when SiFTO and SALT2 are trained on the same data set the cosmological results agree.},

abstract = {We present a new determination of the galaxy stellar-mass function (GSMF) over the redshift interval 0.25 ≤ z ≤ 3.75, derived from a combination of ground-based and Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging surveys. Based on a near-IR-selected galaxy sample selected over a raw survey area of 3 deg2 and spanning ≥4 dex in stellar mass, we fit the GSMF with both single and double Schechter functions, carefully accounting for Eddington bias to derive both observed and intrinsic parameter values. We find that a double Schechter function is a better fit to the GSMF at all redshifts, although the single and double Schechter function fits are statistically indistinguishable by z = 3.25. We find no evidence for significant evolution in M⋆, with the intrinsic value consistent with {\$}\backslashlog {\_}{\{}10{\}}(M{\^{}}{\{}\backslashstar {\}}/\backslashhbox{\{}{\$}$\backslash$rm $\backslash$, M{\_}{\{}$\backslash$odot {\}}{\$}{\}})=10.55\backslashpm {\{}0.1{\}}{\$} over the full redshift range. Overall, our determination of the GSMF is in good agreement with recent simulation results, although differences persist at the highest stellar masses. Splitting our sample according to location on the UVJ plane, we find that the star-forming GSMF can be adequately described by a single Schechter function over the full redshift range, and has not evolved significantly since z ≃ 2.5. In contrast, both the normalization and the functional form of the passive GSMF evolve dramatically with redshift, switching from a single to a double Schechter function at z ≤ 1.5. As a result, we find that while passive galaxies dominate the integrated stellar-mass density at z ≤ 0.75, they only contribute ≲10 per cent by z ≃ 3. Finally, we provide a simple parametrization that provides an accurate estimate of the GSMF, both observed and intrinsic, at any redshift within the range 0 ≤ z ≤ 4.},

abstract = {The galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) at high-z provides key information on star-formation history and mass assembly in the young Universe. We aimed to use the unique combination of deep optical/NIR/MIR imaging provided by HST, Spitzer and the VLT in the CANDELS-UDS, GOODS-South, and HUDF fields to determine the GSMF over the redshift range 3.5{\textless}z{\textless}7.5. We utilised the HST WFC3/IR NIR imaging from CANDELS and HUDF09, reaching H{\~{}}27-28.5 over a total area of 369 arcmin2, in combination with associated deep HST ACS optical data, deep Spitzer IRAC imaging from the SEDS programme, and deep Y and K-band VLT Hawk-I images from the HUGS programme, to select a galaxy sample with high-quality photometric redshifts. These have been calibrated with more than 150 spectroscopic redshifts in the range 3.5{\textless}z{\textless}7.5, resulting in an overall precision of sigma{\_}z/(1+z){\~{}}0.037. We have determined the low-mass end of the high-z GSMF with unprecedented precision, reaching down to masses as low as M*{\~{}}10{\^{}}9 Msun at z=4 and {\~{}}6x10{\^{}}9 Msun at z=7. We find that the GSMF at 3.5{\textless}z{\textless}7.5 depends only slightly on the recipes adopted to measure the stellar masses, namely the photo-z, the SFHs, the nebular contribution or the presence of AGN on the parent sample. The low-mass end of the GSMF is steeper than has been found at lower redshifts, but appears to be unchanged over the redshift range probed here. Our results are very different from previous GSMF estimates based on converting UV galaxy luminosity functions into mass functions via tight M/L relations. Integrating our evolving GSMF over mass, we find that the growth of stellar mass density is barely consistent with the time-integral of the SFR density over cosmic time at z{\textgreater}4. These results confirm the unique synergy of the CANDELS+HUDF, HUGS, and SEDS surveys for the discovery and study of moderate/low-mass galaxies at high redshifts.},

Using H$\delta$ A absorption as a proxy for stellar age, we constrain five of the galaxies to have young (∼600 Myr) light-weighted ages at all radii and find that the sample on average has flat age gradients. We examine the spatial distribution of mass-weighted properties by fitting our profiles with a toy model including a young, centrally concentrated burst superimposed on an older, extended population. We find that galaxies with flat H$\delta$ A profiles are inconsistent with formation via a central secondary starburst.

While constraints on these slopes generally become more challenging at higher redshifts as the UV continuum shifts out of the Hubble Space Telescope bands (particularly at z{\textgreater}7), such a characterisation actually becomes abruptly easier for galaxies in the redshift window z=9.5-10.5 due to the Spitzer/IRAC 3.6um-band probing the rest-UV continuum and the long wavelength baseline between this Spitzer band and the Hubble H-band. Higher S/N constraints on the UV slope are possible at z{\~{}}10 than at z=8.

abstract = {By fitting stellar populations to SDSS-IV MaNGA survey observations of ∼7000 suitably-weighted individual galaxies, we reconstruct the star-formation history of the Universe, which we find to be in reasonable agreement with previous studies. Dividing the galaxies by their present-day stellar mass, we demonstrate the downsizing phenomenon, whereby the more massive galaxies hosted the most star-formation at earlier times. Further dividing the galaxy sample by colour and morphology, we find that a galaxy's present-day colour tell us more about its historical contribution to the cosmic star formation history than its current morphology. We show that downsizing effects are greatest among galaxies currently in the blue cloud, but that the level of downsizing in galaxies of different morphologies depends quite sensitively on the morphological classification used, due largely to the difficulty in classifying the smaller low-mass galaxies from their ground-based images. Nevertheless, we find agreement that among galaxies with stellar masses M⋆ {\textgreater} 6 × 109 M⊙, downsizing is most significant in spirals. However, there are complicating factors. For example, for more massive galaxies, we find that colour and morphology are predictors of the past star formation over a longer timescale than in less massive systems. Presumably this effect is reflecting the longer period of evolution required to alter these larger galaxies' physical properties, but shows that conclusions based on any single property don't tell the full story.},

Our high-resolution observations confirm that AzTEC2 splits into two components (namely AzTEC2-A and AzTEC2-B) for which we detect [C{\$}\backslash,{\$}II] and {\$}{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}{\$}CO(5{\$}\backslashto{\$}4) line emission, implying a redshift of {\$}4.626\backslashpm0.001{\$} ({\$}4.633\backslashpm0.001{\$}) for AzTEC2-A (AzTEC2-B) and ruling out previous associations with a galaxy at {\$}z\backslashsim1{\$}. We use the {\$}{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}{\$}CO(5{\$}\backslashto{\$}4) line emission and adopt typical SMG-like gas excitation conditions to estimate the molecular gas mass, which is {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm gas{\}}(\backslashalpha{\_}{\{}\backslashrm CO{\}}/2.5)=2.1\backslashpm0.4 \backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}{\{}\backslashrm M{\}}{\_}\backslashodot{\$} for AzTEC2-A, and a factor four lower for AzTEC2-B. With the infrared-derived star formation rate of AzTEC2-A ({\$}1920\backslashpm100 \backslash,M{\_}\backslashodot{\{}\backslashrm \backslash, yr{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}) and AzTEC2-B ({\$}710\backslashpm 35\backslash,M{\_}\backslashodot{\{}\backslashrm \backslash,yr{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}), they both will consume their current gas reservoir within {\$}(30-200)\backslash,{\$}Myr. We find evidence of a rotation-dominated [C{\$}\backslash,{\$}II] disk in AzTEC2-A, with a de-projected rotational velocity of {\$}v{\_}{\{}\backslashrm rot{\}}(i=39{\^{}}\backslashcirc)=660\backslashpm130{\{}\backslashrm \backslash,km\backslash,s{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}, velocity dispersion {\$}\backslashlesssim100{\{}\backslashrm \backslash,km\backslash,s{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}, and dynamical mass of {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm dyn{\}}(i=39{\^{}}\backslashcirc)=2.6{\^{}}{\{}+1.2{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.9{\}}\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}\backslash,M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. We propose that an elevated gas accretion rate from the cosmic web might be the main driver of the intense levels of star formation in AzTEC2-A, which might be further enhanced by gravitational torques induced by its minor companion (AzTEC2-B). These results strengthen the picture whereby the population of single-dish selected SMGs is rather heterogeneous, including a population of pairs of massive, highly-active galaxies in a pre-coalescence phase.},

Due to significant limitations in the availability of such data for statistically complete samples, observational results have been limited to modest numbers of bright or lensed sources. To revolutionize the present characterization of {\$}z\backslashsim8{\$} galaxies, we exploit the ultradeep ({\$}\backslashsim27{\$} mag, {\$}3\backslashsigma{\$}) Spitzer/IRAC {\$}3.6\backslashmu{\$}m and {\$}4.5\backslashmu{\$}m data, probing the rest-frame optical at {\$}z\backslashsim8{\$}, over {\$}\backslashsim200{\$} arcmin{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} of the GOODS fields from the recently completed GOODS Re-ionization Era wide-Area Treasury from Spitzer (GREATS) program, combined with observations in the CANDELS UDS and COSMOS fields.

Meanwhile, the redder {\$}H{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}160{\}}-[3.6]{\$} color seen in the brightest stack is suggestive of slightly older ages. We explored the existence of a correlation between the UV luminosity and age, and find either no trend or fainter galaxies being younger. The stacked SEDs also exhibit very red {\$}[3.6]-[4.5]\backslashsim0.5{\$} mag colors, indicative of intense [OIII]+H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} nebular emission and SFR. The correspondingly high specific star-formation rates, sSFR{\$}\backslashgtrsim10{\$}Gyr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}, are consistent with recent determinations at similar redshifts and higher luminosities, and support the co-evolution between the sSFR and the specific halo mass accretion rate.},

For this analysis we use individual measurements of stellar velocity dispersion from high-S/N spectra from the public Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) survey. We report a remarkable stability of the VDF for both quiescent and star-forming galaxies within this redshift range, though we note the presence of weak evolution in the number densities of star-forming galaxies. We compare both VDFs with previous direct and inferred measurements at local and intermediate redshifts, with the caveat that previous measurements of the VDF for star-forming galaxies are poorly constrained at all epochs. We emphasize that this work is the first to directly push to low-stellar velocity dispersion ({\$}\backslashsigma{\_}\backslashstar {\textgreater} 100{\$} km s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}) and extend to star-forming galaxies.

We find that selecting mergers using the {\$}H{\_}{\{}160{\}}{\$}-band flux ratio leads to an increasing merger fraction with redshift, while selecting mergers using the stellar mass ratio causes a diminishing redshift dependence. Defining major and minor mergers as having stellar mass ratios of 1:1 - 4:1 and 4:1 - 10:1 respectively, the results imply {\$}\backslashsim{\$}1 major and {\$}\backslashlesssim{\$}1 minor merger for an average massive (log{\$}(M{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}) \backslashgeqslant 10.8{\$}) galaxy during {\$}z=0.1-2.5{\$}. There may be an additional {\$}\backslashsim 0.5(0.3){\$} major (minor) merger if we use the {\$}H{\$}-band flux ratio selection. The observed amount of major merging alone is sufficient to explain the observed number density evolution for the very massive (log{\$}(M{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}) \backslashgeqslant 11.1{\$}) galaxies. We argue that these very massive galaxies can put on a maximum of {\$}6\backslash{\%}{\$} of stellar mass in addition to major and minor merging, so that their number density evolution remains consistent with observations. The observed number of major and minor mergers can increase the size of a massive quiescent galaxy by a factor of two at most. This amount of merging is enough to bring the compact quiescent galaxies formed at {\$}z{\textgreater}2{\$} to lie at {\$}1\backslashsigma{\$} below the mean of the stellar mass-size relation as measured in some works (e.g. Newman et al. 2012), but additional mechanisms are needed to fully explain the evolution, and to be consistent with works suggesting stronger evolution (e.g. van der Wel et al. 2014).},

Aperture photometry of the 2008 and 2010 i-band images resulted in the discovery of over 200 variable stars. Yearly servicing left the array defocused for the 2009 winter season, during which the system also suffered from intermittent frosting and power failures. Despite these technical issues, nearly 800,000 useful images were obtained using g, r {\&} clear filters. We developed a combination of difference imaging and aperture photometry to compensate for the highly crowded, blended and defocused frames. We present details of this approach, which may be useful for the analysis of time-series data from other small-aperture telescopes regardless of their image quality. Using this approach, we were able to recover 68 previously-known variables and detected variability in 37 additional objects. We also have determined the observing statistics for Dome A during the 2009 winter season; we find the extinction due to clouds to be less than 0.1 and 0.4 mag for 40{\%} and 63{\%} of the dark time, respectively.},

abstract = {We present Keck/MOSFIRE spectra of the diagnostic nebular emission lines [OIII]5007,4959, [OII]3727, and H-beta for a sample of 15 redshift z=3.1-3.7 Ly-alpha emitters (LAEs) and Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). In conjunction with spectra from other surveys, we confirm earlier indications that LAEs have a much higher [OIII]/[OII] line ratio than is seen in similar redshift LBGs. By comparing their distributions on a [OIII]/[OII] versus R23 diagram, we demonstrate that this difference cannot arise solely because of their lower metallicities but most likely is due to a harder ionizing spectrum. Using measures of H-beta and recombination theory, we demonstrate, for a subset of our LAEs, that xi{\_}ion - the number of Lyman continuum photons per UV luminosity - is indeed 0.2-0.5 dex larger than for typical LBGs at similar redshifts. Using photoionization models we estimate the effect this would have on both [OIII]/[OII] and R23 and conclude such a hard spectrum can only partially explain such intense line emission. The additional possibility is that such a large [OIII]/[OII] ratio is in part due to density rather than ionization bound nebular regions, which would imply a high escape fraction of ionizing photons. We discuss how further observations could confirm this possibility. Clearly LAEs with intense [OIII] emission represent a promising analog of those z{\textgreater}7 sources with similarly strong lines which are thought to be an important contributor to cosmic reionization.},

abstract = {We examine the relation between stellar mass, velocity dispersion, size, S$\backslash$'ersic index and {\$}D{\_}n4000{\$} for {\~{}}40,000 quiescent galaxies in the SDSS. At a fixed stellar mass, galaxies with higher {\$}D{\_}n4000{\$} have larger velocity dispersions and smaller sizes. {\$}D{\_}n4000{\$} is a proxy for stellar population age, thus these trends suggest that older galaxies typically have larger velocity dispersions and smaller sizes. We combine velocity dispersion and size into a dynamical mass estimator, {\$}\backslashsigma{\^{}}2 R{\$}. At a fixed stellar mass, {\$}\backslashsigma{\^{}}2 R{\$} depends on {\$}D{\_}n4000{\$}. The S$\backslash$'ersic index is also correlated with {\$}D{\_}n4000{\$}. The dependence of {\$}\backslashsigma{\^{}}2 R{\$} and S$\backslash$'ersic index on {\$}D{\_}n4000{\$} suggests that quiescent galaxies are not structurally homologous systems. We derive an empirical correction for non-homology which is consistent with the analytical correction derived from the virial theorem. After accounting for non-homologous galactic structure, we measure {\$}M{\_}\backslashast \backslashpropto M{\_}d{\^{}}{\{}0.998 \backslashpm 0.004{\}}{\$} where {\$}M{\_}\backslashast{\$} is the stellar mass and {\$}M{\_}d{\$} is the dynamical mass derived from the velocity dispersion and size; stellar mass is directly proportional to dynamical mass. Quiescent galaxies appear to be in approximate virial equilibrium and deviations of the fundamental plane parameters from the expected virial relation may result from mass-to-light ratio variations, selection effects and the non-homology of quiescent galaxies. We infer the redshift evolution of velocity dispersion and size for galaxies in our sample assuming purely passive evolution. The inferred evolution is inconsistent with direct measurements at higher redshifts. Thus quiescent galaxies do not passively evolve. Quiescent galaxies have properties consistent with standard galaxy formation in {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM. They form at different epochs and evolve modestly increasing their size, velocity dispersion and S$\backslash$'ersic index after they cease star formation.},

The magnitude-redshift data for these SNe, at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83, are fit jointly with a set of SNe from the Calan/Tololo Supernova Survey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological parameters. All SN peak magnitudes are standardized using a SN Ia lightcurve width-luminosity relation. The measurement yields a joint probability distribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by the relation 0.8 Omega{\_}M - 0.6 Omega{\_}Lambda {\~{}}= -0.2 +/- 0.1 in the region of interest (Omega{\_}M {\textless}{\~{}} 1.5).

The data are strongly inconsistent with a Lambda = 0 flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. An open, Lambda = 0 cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological constant is non-zero and positive, with a confidence of P(Lambda {\textgreater} 0) = 99{\%}, including the identified systematic uncertainties. The best-fit age of the universe relative to the Hubble time is t{\_}0 = 14.9{\{}+1.4,-1.1{\}} (0.63/h) Gyr for a flat cosmology. The size of our sample allows us to perform a variety of statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We find no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution or Malmquist bias between the low-redshift Calan/Tololo sample and our high-redshift sample. The conclusions are robust whether or not a width-luminosity relation is used to standardize the SN peak magnitudes.},

abstract = {We measure stellar masses and structural parameters for 5500 quiescent and 20,000 star-forming galaxies at 0.3 {\textless} z ≤ 1.5 in the Newfirm Medium Band Survey COSMOS and UKIDSS UDS fields. We combine these measurements to infer velocity dispersions and determine how the number density of galaxies at fixed inferred dispersion, or the velocity dispersion function (VDF), evolves with time for each population. We show that the number of galaxies with high velocity dispersions appears to be surprisingly stable with time, regardless of their star formation history. Furthermore, the overall VDF for star-forming galaxies is constant with redshift, extending down to the lowest velocity dispersions probed by this study. The only galaxy population showing strong evolution are quiescent galaxies with low inferred dispersions, whose number density increases by a factor of ∼ 4 since z = 1.5. This buildup leads to an evolution in the quiescent fraction of galaxies such that the threshold dispersion above which quiescent galaxies dominate the counts moves to lower velocity dispersion with time. We show that our results are qualitatively consistent with a simple model in which star-forming galaxies quench and are added to the quiescent population. In order to compensate for the migration into the quiescent population, the velocity dispersions of star-forming galaxies must increase, with a rate that increases with dispersion. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {Recent studies have shown that massive quiescent galaxies at high redshift are much more compact than present-day galaxies of the same mass. Here we compare the radial stellar density profiles and the number density of a sample of massive galaxies at z 2.3 to nearby massive elliptical galaxies. We confirm that the average stellar densities of the z 2.3 galaxies within the effective radius, $\rho$({\textless}re ), are two orders of magnitude higher than those of local elliptical galaxies of the same stellar mass. However, we also find that the densities measured within a constant physical radius of 1 kpc, $\rho$({\textless}1 kpc), are higher by a factor of 2-3 only. This suggests that inside-out growth scenarios are plausible, in which the compact high-redshift galaxies make up the centers of normal nearby ellipticals. The compact galaxies are common at high redshift, which enables us to further constrain their evolution by requiring that the number density of their descendants does not exceed constraints imposed by the z = 0 galaxy mass function. We infer that size growth must be efficient, with (r 1+2/r 1) (M 1+2/M 1)2. A simple model where compact galaxies with masses 1011 M primarily grow through minor mergers produces descendants with the approximate sizes, stellar densities, and number density of elliptical galaxies with masses 2-3 × 1011 M in the local universe. We note that this model also predicts evolution in the M BH - $\sigma$ relation, such that the progenitors of elliptical galaxies have lower black hole masses at fixed velocity dispersion. The main observational uncertainty is the conversion from light to mass; measurements of kinematics are needed to calibrate the masses and stellar densities of the high-redshift galaxies. {\textcopyright} 2009.

We find a large population of massive young recently quenched ("post-starburst") galaxies at z {\textgreater} 1 that are almost non-existent at z {\textless} 1; their number density is 5 × 10-5 Mpc-3 at z = 2, whereas it is a factor of 10 less at z = 0.5. The observed number densities of young and old quiescent galaxies at z {\textgreater} 1 are consistent with a simple model in which all old quiescent galaxies were once identified as post-starburst galaxies. We find that the overall population of quiescent galaxies have smaller sizes and slightly more elongated shapes at higher redshift, in agreement with other recent studies. Interestingly, the most recently quenched galaxies at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2 are not larger, and possibly even smaller, than older galaxies at those redshifts. This result is inconsistent with the idea that the evolution of the average size of quiescent galaxies is largely driven by continuous transformations of larger, star-forming galaxies: in that case, the youngest quiescent galaxies would also be the largest. Instead, mergers or other mechanisms appear to be required to explain the size growth of quiescent galaxies from z = 2 to the present.},

abstract = {The rest-frame UV-optical (i.e., {\$}NUV-B{\$}) color is sensitive to both low-level recent star formation (specific star formation rate - sSFR) and dust. In this Letter, we extend our previous work on the origins of {\$}NUV-B{\$} color gradients in star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at {\$}z\backslashsim1{\$} to those at {\$}z\backslashsim2{\$}. We use a sample of 1335 large (semi-major axis radius {\$}R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm SMA{\}}{\textgreater}0.''18{\$}) SFGs with extended UV emission out to {\$}2R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm SMA{\}}{\$} in the mass range {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}} = 10{\^{}}{\{}9{\}}-10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} at {\$}1.5{\textless}z{\textless}2.8{\$} in the CANDELS/GOODS-S and UDS fields. We show that these SFGs generally have negative {\$}NUV-B{\$} color gradients (redder centres), and their color gradients strongly increase with galaxy mass. We also show that the global rest-frame {\$}FUV-NUV{\$} color is approximately linear with {\$}A{\_}{\{}\backslashrm V{\}}{\$}, which is derived by modeling the observed integrated FUV to NIR spectral energy distributions of the galaxies. Applying this integrated calibration to our spatially-resolved data, we find a negative dust gradient (more dust extinguished in the centers), which steadily becomes steeper with galaxy mass. We further find that the {\$}NUV-B{\$} color gradients become nearly zero after correcting for dust gradients regardless of galaxy mass. This indicates that the sSFR gradients are negligible and dust reddening is likely the principal cause of negative UV-optical color gradients in these SFGs. Our findings support that the buildup of the stellar mass in SFGs at the Cosmic Noon is self-similar inside {\$}2R{\_}{\{}\backslashrm SMA{\}}{\$}.},

abstract = {We present the results of a Spitzer/Herschel infrared photometric analysis of the largest (716) and highest-redshift (z=1.8) sample of Brightest Cluster Galaxies (BCGs), those from the Spitzer Adaptation of the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (SpARCS). Given the tension that exists between model predictions and recent observations of BCGs at z{\textless}2, we aim to uncover the dominant physical mechanism(s) guiding the stellar-mass buildup of this special class of galaxies, the most massive in the Universe uniquely residing at the centres of galaxy clusters. Through a comparison of their stacked, broadband, infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to a variety of SED model templates in the literature, we identify the major sources of their infrared energy output, in multiple redshift bins between 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.8. We derive estimates of various BCG physical parameters from the stacked {\{}$\backslash$nu{\}}L{\{}$\backslash$nu{\}} SEDs, from which we infer a star-forming, as opposed to a 'red and dead' population of galaxies, producing tens to hundreds of solar masses per year down to z=0.5. This discovery challenges the accepted belief that BCGs should only passively evolve through a series of gas-poor, minor mergers since z{\~{}}4 (De Lucia {\&} Blaizot 2007), but agrees with the improved semi-analytic model of hierarchical structure formation of Tonini et al. (2012), which predicts star-forming BCGs throughout the epoch considered. We attribute the star formation inferred from the stacked infrared SEDs to both major and minor 'wet' (gas-rich) mergers, based on a lack of key signatures (to date) of the cluster cooling flows to which BCG star formation is typically attributed, as well as a number of observational and simulation-based studies that support this scenario.},

abstract = {Since low-mass stars have low luminosities, orbits at which liquid water can exist on Earth-sized planets are relatively close-in, which produces Doppler signals that are detectable using state-of-the-art Doppler spectroscopy. GJ 667C is already known to be orbited by two super-Earth candidates. We investigate whether the data supports the presence of additional companions. We obtain new Doppler measurements from HARPS extracted spectra and combined them with those obtained from the PFS and HIRES spectrographs. We used Bayesian and periodogram-based methods to re-assess the number of candidates and evaluated the confidence of each detection. Among other tests, we validated the planet candidates by analyzing correlations of each Doppler signal activity indices and investigate quasi-periodicity. Doppler measurements of GJ 667C are described better by six Keplerian-like signals: the two known candidates (b and c); three additional few-Earth mass candidates with periods of 92, 62 and 39 days (d, e and f); a cold super-Earth in a 260-day orbit (g) and tantalizing evidence of a {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 1 M{\$}{\_}\backslashoplus{\$} object in a close-in orbit of 17 days (h). We explore whether long-term stable orbits are compatible with the data by integrating 8{\$}\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}4{\$} solutions derived from the Bayesian samplings. The system consisting of six planets is compatible with dynamically stable configurations. As for the solar system, the most stable solutions do not contain mean-motion resonances and are described well by analytic Laplace-Lagrange solutions. The presence of a seventh planet (h) is supported by the fact that it appears squarely centered on the only island of stability left in the six-planet solution. Habitability assessments accounting for the stellar flux, as well as tidal dissipation effects, indicate that three (maybe four) planets are potentially habitable...},

abstract = {In the context of measuring structure and morphology of intermediate redshift galaxies with recent HST/ACS surveys, we tune, test, and compare two widely used fitting codes (GALFIT and GIM2D) for fitting single-component Sersic models to the light profiles of both simulated and real galaxy data. We find that fitting accuracy depends sensitively on galaxy profile shape. Exponential disks are well fit with Sersic models and have small measurement errors, whereas fits to de Vaucouleurs profiles show larger uncertainties owing to the large amount of light at large radii. We find that both codes provide reliable fits and little systematic error, when the effective surface brightness is above that of the sky. Moreover, both codes return errors that significantly underestimate the true fitting uncertainties, which are best estimated with simulations. We find that GIM2D suffers significant systematic errors for spheroids with close companions owing to the difficulty of effectively masking out neighboring galaxy light; there appears to be no work around to this important systematic in GIM2D's current implementation. While this crowding error affects only a small fraction of galaxies in GEMS, it must be accounted for in the analysis of deeper cosmological images or of more crowded fields with GIM2D. In contrast, GALFIT results are robust to the presence of neighbors because it can simultaneously fit the profiles of multiple companions thereby deblending their effect on the fit to the galaxy of interest. We find GALFIT's robustness to nearby companions and factor of {\textgreater}{\~{}}20 faster runtime speed are important advantages over GIM2D for analyzing large HST/ACS datasets. Finally we include our final catalog of fit results for all 41,495 objects detected in GEMS.},

abstract = {It has recently been proposed that one sub-class of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is sufficiently both distinct and common to be classified separately from the bulk of SNe Ia, with a suggested class name of "type Iax supernovae" (SNe Iax), after SN 2002cx. However, their progenitors are still uncertain. We study whether the population properties of this class might be understood if the events originate from a subset of sub-Chandrasekhar mass explosions. In this potential progenitor population, a carbon--oxygen white dwarf (CO WD) accumulates a helium layer from a non-degenerate helium star; ignition of that helium layer then leads to ignition of the CO WD. We incorporated detailed binary evolution calculations for the progenitor systems into a binary population synthesis model to obtain rates and delay times for such events. The predicted Galactic event rate of these explosions is {\~{}}1.5$\backslash$times10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\{}yr{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} according to our standard model, in good agreement with the measured rates of SNe Iax. In addition, predicted delay times are {\~{}}70Myr-800Myr, consistent with the fact that most of SNe Iax have been discovered in late-type galaxies. If the explosions are assumed to be double-detonations -- following current model expectations -- then based on the CO WD masses at explosion we also estimate the distribution of resulting SN brightness (-13 $\backslash$gtrsim M{\_}{\{}bol{\}} $\backslash$gtrsim -19mag), which can reproduce the empirical diversity of SNe Iax. We speculate on why binaries with non-degenerate donor stars might lead to SNe Iax if similar systems with degenerate donors do not. We suggest that the high mass of the helium layer necessary for ignition at the lower accretion rates typically delivered from non-degenerate donors might be necessary to produce SN 2002cx-like characteristics, perhaps even by changing the nature of the CO ignition.},

abstract = {We present a detailed study of the colours of late-type galaxy discs for ten of the EDisCS galaxy clusters with 0.5 ≲ z ≲ 0.8. Our cluster sample contains 172 spiral galaxies, and our control sample is composed of 96 field disc galaxies. We deconvolved their ground-based V and I images obtained with FORS2 at the VLT with initial spatial resolutions between 0.4 and 0.8 arcsec to achieve a final resolution of 0.1 arcsec with 0.05 arcsec pixels, which is close to the resolution of the ACS at the HST. After removing the central region of each galaxy to avoid pollution by the bulges, we measured the V-I colours of the discs. We find that 50{\%} of cluster spiral galaxies have disc V-I colours redder by more than 1$\sigma$ of the mean colours of their field counterparts. This is well above the 16{\%} expected for a normal distribution centred on the field disc properties. The prominence of galaxies with red discs depends neither on the mass of their parent cluster nor on the distance of the galaxies to the cluster cores. Passive spiral galaxies constitute 20{\%} of our sample. These systems are not abnormally dusty. They are are made of old stars and are located on the cluster red sequences. Another 24{\%} of our sample is composed of galaxies that are still active and star forming, but less so than galaxies with similar morphologies in the field. These galaxies are naturally located in the blue sequence of their parent cluster colour-magnitude diagrams. The reddest of the discs in clusters must have stopped forming stars more than ∼5 Gyr ago. Some of them are found among infalling galaxies, suggesting preprocessing. Our results confirm that galaxies are able to continue forming stars for some significant period of time after being accreted into clusters, and suggest that star formation can decline on seemingly long (1 to 5 Gyr) timescales.},

PEARLS uses up to eight NIRCam filters to survey several prime extragalactic survey areas: two fields at the North Ecliptic Pole (NEP); seven gravitationally lensing clusters; two high redshift proto-clusters; and the iconic backlit VV{\~{}}191 galaxy system to map its dust attenuation. PEARLS also includes NIRISS spectra for one of the NEP fields and NIRSpec spectra of two high-redshift quasars. The main goal of PEARLS is to study the epoch of galaxy assembly, AGN growth, and First Light. Five fields, the JWST NEP Time-Domain Field (TDF), IRAC Dark Field (IDF), and three lensing clusters, will be observed in up to four epochs over a year. The cadence and sensitivity of the imaging data are ideally suited to find faint variable objects such as weak AGN, high-redshift supernovae, and cluster caustic transits. Both NEP fields have sightlines through our Galaxy, providing significant numbers of very faint brown dwarfs whose proper motions can be studied. Observations from the first spoke in the NEP TDF are public. This paper presents our first PEARLS observations, their NIRCam data reduction and analysis, our first object catalogs, the 0.9-4.5 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m galaxy counts and Integrated Galaxy Light. We assess the JWST sky brightness in 13 NIRCam filters, yielding our first constraints to diffuse light at 0.9-4.5 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m.

The H-alpha line is robustly detected in 20 out of 120 UVJ-selected quiescent galaxies, and we classify the emission mechanism using the H-alpha line width and the [NII]/H-alpha line ratio. We find that AGN are likely to be responsible for the line emission in more than half of the cases. We also find robust evidence for star formation activity in nine quiescent galaxies, which we explore in detail. The H-alpha kinematics reveal rotating disks in five of the nine galaxies. The dust-corrected H-alpha star formation rates are low (0.2 - 7 Msun/yr), and place these systems significantly below the main sequence. The 24micron-based infrared luminosities, instead, overestimate the star formation rates. These galaxies present a lower gas-phase metallicity compared to star-forming objects with similar stellar mass, and many of them have close companions. We therefore conclude that the low-level star formation activity in these nine quiescent galaxies is likely to be fueled by inflowing gas or minor mergers, and could be a sign of rejuvenation events.},

abstract = {We present an updated analysis of the intrinsic colors of SNe Ia using the latest data release of the Carnegie Supernova Project. We introduce a new light-curve parameter very similar to stretch that is better suited for fast-declining events, and find that these peculiar types can be seen as extensions to the population of "normal" SNe Ia. With a larger number of objects, an updated fit to the Lira relation is presented along with evidence for a dependence on the late-time slope of the B-V color-curves with stretch and color. Using the full wavelength range from u to H band, we place constraints on the reddening law for the sample as a whole and also for individual events/hosts based solely on the observed colors. The photometric data continue to favor low values of Rv, though with large variations from event to event, indicating an intrinsic distribution. We confirm the findings of other groups that there appears to be a correlation between the derived reddening law, Rv, and the color excess, E(B-V), such that larger E(B-V) tends to favor lower Rv. The intrinsic u-band colors show a relatively large scatter that cannot be explained by variations in Rv or by the Goobar (2008) power-law for circumstellar dust, but rather is correlated with spectroscopic features of the supernova and is therefore likely due to metallicity effects.},

@article{Cappellari2012,
abstract = {Much of our knowledge of galaxies comes from analysing the radiation emitted by their stars, which depends on the present number of each type of star in the galaxy. The present number depends on the stellar initial mass function (IMF), which describes the distribution of stellar masses when the population formed, and knowledge of it is critical to almost every aspect of galaxy evolution. More than 50 years after the first IMF determination, no consensus has emerged on whether it is universal among different types of galaxies. Previous studies indicated that the IMF and the dark matter fraction in galaxy centres cannot both be universal, but they could not convincingly discriminate between the two possibilities. Only recently were indications found that massive elliptical galaxies may not have the same IMF as the Milky Way. Here we report a study of the two-dimensional stellar kinematics for the large representative ATLAS 3D sample of nearby early-type galaxies spanning two orders of magnitude in stellar mass, using detailed dynamical models. We find a strong systematic variation in IMF in early-type galaxies as a function of their stellar mass-to-light ratios, producing differences of a factor of up to three in galactic stellar mass. This implies that a galaxy's IMF depends intimately on the galaxy's formation history. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We examine the relation between stellar mass and central stellar velocity dispersion-the M-sigma relation-for massive quiescent galaxies at z{\textless}0.7. We measure the local relation from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the intermediate redshift relation from the Smithsonian Hectospec Lensing Survey. Both samples are highly complete ({\textgreater}85{\%}) and we consistently measure the stellar mass and velocity dispersion for the two samples. The M-sigma relation and its scatter are independent of redshift with sigma {\~{}} M{\^{}}0.3 for M{\textgreater}10{\^{}}10.3 M{\_}solar. The measured slope of the M-sigma relation is the same as the scaling between the total halo mass and the dark matter halo velocity dispersion obtained by N-body simulations. This consistency suggests that massive quiescent galaxies are virialized systems where the central dark matter concentration is either a constant or negligible fraction of the stellar mass. The relation between the total galaxy mass (stellar + dark matter) and the central stellar velocity dispersion is consistent with the observed relation between the total mass of a galaxy cluster and the velocity dispersion of the cluster members. This result suggests that the central stellar velocity dispersion is directly proportional to the velocity dispersion of the dark matter halo. Thus the central stellar velocity dispersion is a fundamental, directly observable property of galaxies that may robustly connect galaxies to dark matter halos in N-body simulations. To interpret the results further in the context of Lambda-CDM, it would be useful to analyze the relationship between the velocity dispersion of stellar particles and the velocity dispersion characterizing their dark matter halos in high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic simulations.},

With its coverage of the full suite of strong rest-frame optical emission lines, MOSDEF provides an unprecedented view of the rest-frame optical spectra of a representative sample of distant star-forming galaxies. We investigate the locations of z ∼ 2.3 MOSDEF galaxies in multiple emission-line diagnostic diagrams. These include the [O iii]$\lambda$5007/H$\beta$ vs. [N ii]/H$\alpha$ and [O iii]$\lambda$5007/H$\beta$ vs. [S ii]$\lambda$$\lambda$6717, 6731/H$\alpha$ "BPT" diagrams, as well as the O32 vs. R23 excitation diagram. We recover the well-known offset in the star-forming sequence of high-redshift galaxies in the [O iii]$\lambda$5007/H$\beta$ vs. [N ii]/H$\alpha$ BPT diagram relative to Sloan Digital Sky Survey star-forming galaxies. However, the shift for our rest-frame optically selected sample is less significant than for rest-frame-UV selected and emission-line selected galaxies at z ∼ 2. Furthermore, we find that the offset is mass-dependent, only appearing within the low-mass half of the z ∼ 2.3 MOSDEF sample, where galaxies are shifted toward higher [N ii]/H$\alpha$ at fixed [O iii]/H$\beta$. Within the [O iii]$\lambda$5007/H$\beta$ vs. [S ii]/H$\alpha$ and O32 vs. R23 diagrams, we find that z ∼ 2.3 galaxies are distributed like local ones, and therefore attribute the shift in the [O iii]$\lambda$5007/H$\beta$ vs. [N ii]/H$\alpha$ BPT diagram to elevated N/O abundance ratios among lower-mass () high-redshift galaxies. The variation in N/O ratios calls into question the use at high redshift of oxygen abundance indicators based on nitrogen lines, but the apparent invariance with redshift of the excitation sequence in the O32 vs. R23 diagram paves the way for using the combination of O32 and R23 as an unbiased metallicity indicator over a wide range in redshift. This indicator will allow for an accurate characterization of the shape and normalization of the mass-metallicity relationship over more than 10 Gyr.},

While more than 20 proto-clusters have been observed at z ≲ 2 based on associations of 540 galaxies around rare sources, the observational evidence for rapid cluster formation is weak. Here we report observations of an asymmetric filamentary structure at z = 2.47 containing 7 starbursting, submillimeter-luminous galaxies and 5 additional active galactic nuclei (AGNs) within a comoving volume of 15,000 Mpc3. As the expected lifetime of both the luminous AGN and starburst phase of a galaxy is ∼100 Myr, we conclude that these sources were likely triggered in rapid succession by environmental factors or, alternatively, the duration of these cosmologically rare phenomena is much longer than prior direct measurements suggest. The stellar mass already built up in the structure is ∼10{\textless}inf{\textgreater}12{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} M⊙ and we estimate that the cluster mass will exceed that of the Coma supercluster at z ∼ 0. The filamentary structure is in line with hierarchical growth simulations that predict that the peak of cluster activity occurs rapidly at z {\textless} 2.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the issue of how best to correct astronomical data for the wavelength-dependent effects of Galactic interstellar extinction. The main general features of extinction from the IR through the UV are reviewed, along with the nature of observed spatial variations. The enormous range of extinction properties found in the Galaxy, particularly in the UV spectral region, is illustrated. Fortunately, there are some tight constraints on the wavelength dependence of extinction and some general correlations between extinction curve shape and interstellar environment. These relationships provide some guidance for correcting data for the effects of extinction. Several strategies for dereddening are discussed along with estimates of the uncertainties inherent in each method. In the Appendix, a new derivation of the wavelength dependence of an average Galactic extinction curve from the IR through the UV is presented, along with a new estimate of how this extinction law varies with the parameter R = A(V)/E(B-V). These curves represent the true monochromatic wavelength dependence of extinction and, as such, are suitable for dereddening IR--UV spectrophotometric data of any resolution, and can be used to derive extinction relations for any photometry system.},

abstract = {Utilizing spectroscopic observations taken for the VIMOS Ultra-Deep Survey (VUDS), new observations from Keck/DEIMOS, and publicly available observations of large samples of star-forming galaxies, we report here on the relationship between the star-formation rate (SFR) and the local environment ( $\delta$ gal ) of galaxies in the early universe (2 {\textless} z {\textless} 5). Unlike what is observed at lower redshifts ( z ≲ 2), we observe a definite, nearly monotonic increase in the average SFR with increasing galaxy overdensity over more than an order of magnitude in $\delta$ gal . The robustness of this trend is quantified by accounting for both uncertainties in our measurements and galaxy populations that are either underrepresented or not present in our sample (e.g., extremely dusty star-forming and quiescent galaxies), and we find that the trend remains significant under all circumstances. This trend appears to be primarily driven by the fractional increase of galaxies in high-density environments that are more massive in their stellar content and are forming stars at a higher rate than their less massive counterparts. We find that, even after stellar mass effects are accounted for, there remains a weak but significant SFR– $\delta$ gal trend in our sample implying that additional environmentally related processes are helping to drive this trend. We also find clear evidence that the average SFR of galaxies in the densest environments increases with increasing redshift. These results lend themselves to a picture in which massive gas-rich galaxies coalesce into proto-cluster environments at z ≳ 3, interact with other galaxies or with a forming large-scale medium, subsequently using or losing most of their gas in the process, and begin to seed the nascent red sequence that is present in clusters at slightly lower redshifts.},

abstract = {We investigate the change in ionizing photons in galaxies between 0.2{\textless}z{\textless}0.6 using the F2 field of the SHELS complete galaxy redshift survey. We show, for the first time, that while the [OIII]/Hb and [OIII]/[OII] ratios rise, the [NII]/H-alpha and [SII]/H-alpha ratios fall significantly over the 0.2{\textless}z{\textless}0.35 redshift range for stellar masses between 9.2{\textless}log(M/Msun){\textless}10.6. The [OIII]/H-beta and [OIII]/[OII] ratios continue to rise across the full 0.2{\textless}z{\textless}0.6 redshift range for stellar masses between 9.8{\textless}log(M/Msun){\textless}10.0. We conclusively rule out AGN contamination, a changing ISM pressure, and a change in the hardness of the EUV radiation field as the cause of the change in the line ratios between 0.2{\textless}z{\textless}0.35. We find that the ionization parameter rises significantly with redshift (by 0.1 to 0.25 dex depending on the stellar mass of the sample). We show that the ionization parameter is strongly correlated with the fraction of young-to-old stars, as traced by the H-beta equivalent width. We discuss the implications of this result on higher redshift studies, and we consider the implications on the use of standard optical metallicity diagnostics at high redshift.},

abstract = {We calculate the optical bJ luminosity function (LF) of the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS) for different subsets defined by their spectral properties. These spectrally selected subsets are defined using a new parameter, $\eta$, which is a linear combination of the first two projections derived from a Principal Component Analysis. This parameter $\eta$ identifies the average emission-and absorption-line strength in the galaxy rest frame spectrum, and hence is a useful indicator of the present star formation. We use a total of 75000 galaxies in our calculations, chosen from a sample of high signal-to-noise ratio, low-redshift galaxies observed before 2001 January. We find that there is a systematic steepening of the faint-end slope ($\alpha$) as one moves from passive ($\alpha$ = -0.54) to active ($\alpha$ = -1.50) star-forming galaxies, and that there is also a corresponding faintening of the rest frame characteristic magnitude M* - 5 log10(h) (from -19.6 to -19.2). We also show that the Schechter function provides a poor fit to the quiescent (Type 1) LF for very faint galaxies [MbJ -5 log10(h) fainter than -16.0], perhaps suggesting the presence of a significant dwarf population. The LFs presented here give a precise confirmation of the trends seen previously in a much smaller preliminary 2dFGRS sample, and in other surveys. We also present a new procedure for determining self-consistent k-corrections, and investigate possible fibre-aperture biases.},

abstract = {We present the first public data release of the GOGREEN and GCLASS surveys of galaxies in dense environments, spanning a redshift range 0.8 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.5. The surveys consist of deep, multiwavelength photometry and extensive Gemini GMOS spectroscopy of galaxies in 26 overdense systems ranging in halo mass from small groups to the most massive clusters. The objective of both projects was primarily to understand how the evolution of galaxies is affected by their environment, and to determine the physical processes that lead to the quenching of star formation. There was an emphasis on obtaining unbiased spectroscopy over a wide stellar mass range (M ≳ 2 × 1010 M⊙), throughout and beyond the cluster virialized regions. The final spectroscopic sample includes 2771 unique objects, of which 2257 have reliable spectroscopic redshifts. Of these, 1704 have redshifts in the range 0.8 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.5, and nearly 800 are confirmed cluster members. Imaging spans the full optical and near-infrared wavelength range, at depths comparable to the UltraVISTA survey, and includes HST/WFC3 F160W (GOGREEN) and F140W (GCLASS). This data release includes fully reduced images and spectra, with catalogues of advanced data products including redshifts, line strengths, star formation rates, stellar masses and rest-frame colours. Here we present an overview of the data, including an analysis of the spectroscopic completeness and redshift quality.},

For 2905 field galaxies, complete to 10{\^{}}10(10{\^{}}10.8) Msun at z{\textless}0.7(1), with Keck spectroscopic redshifts out to z=1.1, we compile SF rates (SFR) from emission lines, GALEX, and Spitzer MIPS 24 micron photometry, optical-NIR M* measurements, and HST morphologies. Galaxies with reliable signs of SF form a distinct "main sequence (MS)", with a limited range of SFR at a given M* and z (1 sigma {\textless} +-0.3 dex), and log(SFR) approximately proportional to log(M*). The range of log(SFR) remains constant to z{\textgreater}1, while the MS as a whole moves to higher SFR as z increases. The range of SFR along the MS constrains the amplitude of episodic variations of SF, and the effect of mergers on SFR. Typical galaxies spend {\~{}}67(95){\%} of their lifetime since z=1 within a factor of {\textless}{\~{}} 2(4) of their average SFR at a given M* and z. The dominant mode of the evolution of SF since z{\~{}}1 is apparently a gradual decline of the average SFR in most individual galaxies, not a decreasing frequency of starburst episodes, or a decreasing factor by which SFR are enhanced in starbursts. LIRGs at z{\~{}}1 seem to mostly reflect the high SFR typical for massive galaxies at that epoch. The smooth MS may reflect that the same set of few physical processes governs star formation prior to additional quenching processes. A gradual process like gas exhaustion may play a dominant role.},

abstract = {The past decade has seen impressive progress in the detection of {\$}z{\textgreater}7{\$} galaxies with the Hubble Space Telescope, however little is known about their properties. The James Webb Space Telescope will revolutionise the high-{\$}z{\$} field by providing NIR (i.e., rest-frame optical) data of unprecedented depth and spatial resolution. Measuring galaxy quantities such as resolved stellar ages or gas metallicity gradients traditionally requires spectroscopy, as broad-band imaging filters are generally too coarse to fully isolate diagnostics such as the 4000 $\backslash$r{\{}A{\}} (rest-frame) break, continuum emission from aged stars, and key emission lines (e.g., [OII], [OIII], H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$}). However, in this paper, we show that adding NIRCam images through a strategically chosen medium-band filter to common wide-band filters sets adopted by ERS and GTO programs delivers tighter constraints on these galactic properties. To constrain the choice of filter, we perform a systematic investigation of which combinations of wide-band filters from ERS and GTO programs and single medium-band filters offer the tightest constraints on several galaxy properties at redshifts {\$}z\backslashsim7-11{\$}. We employ the JAGUAR extragalactic catalogs to construct statistical samples of physically-motivated mock photometry and conduct SED-fitting procedures to evaluate the accuracy of galaxy property (and photo-{\$}z{\$}) recovery with a simple star-formation history model. We find that adding {\$}{\textgreater}4.1 \backslashmu{\$}m medium filters at comparable depth to the broad-band filters can significantly improve photo-{\$}z{\$}s and yield close to order-of-magnitude improvements in the determination of quantities such as stellar ages, metallicities, SF-related quantities and emission line fluxes at {\$}z\backslashsim8{\$}. For resolved sources, the proposed approach enables spatially-resolved determination of these quantities that would be prohibitive with slit spectroscopy.},

@article{YPeng2010,
abstract = {We explore the simple inter-relationships between mass, star formation rate, and environment in the SDSS, zCOSMOS, and other deep surveys. We take a purely empirical approach in identifying those features of galaxy evolution that are demanded by the data and then explore the analytic consequences of these. We show that the differential effects of mass and environment are completely separable to z {\~{}} 1, leading to the idea of two distinct processes of "mass quenching" and "environment quenching." The effect of environment quenching, at fixed over-density, evidently does not change with epoch to z {\~{}} 1 in zCOSMOS, suggesting that the environment quenching occurs as large-scale structure develops in the universe, probably through the cessation of star formation in 30{\%}-70{\%} of satellite galaxies. In contrast, mass quenching appears to be a more dynamic process, governed by a quenching rate. We show that the observed constancy of the Schechter M* and $\alpha$s for star-forming galaxies demands that the quenching of galaxies around and above M* must follow a rate that is statistically proportional to their star formation rates (or closely mimic such a dependence). We then postulate that this simple mass-quenching law in fact holds over a much broader range of stellar mass (2 dex) and cosmic time. We show that the combination of these two quenching processes, plus some additional quenching due to merging naturally produces (1) a quasi-static single Schechter mass function for star-forming galaxies with an exponential cutoff at a value M* that is set uniquely by the constant of proportionality between the star formation and mass quenching rates and (2) a double Schechter function for passive galaxies with two components. The dominant component (at high masses) is produced by mass quenching and has exactly the same M* as the star-forming galaxies but a faint end slope that differs by $\Delta$$\alpha$s {\~{}} 1. The other component is produced by environment effects and has the same M* and $\alpha$s as the star-forming galaxies but an amplitude that is strongly dependent on environment. Subsequent merging of quenched galaxies will modify these predictions somewhat in the denser environments, mildly increasing M* and making $\alpha$s slightly more negative. All of these detailed quantitative inter-relationships between the Schechter parameters of the star-forming and passive galaxies, across a broad range of environments, are indeed seen to high accuracy in the SDSS, lending strong support to our simple empirically based model. We find that the amount of post-quenching "dry merging" that could have occurred is quite constrained. Our model gives a prediction for the mass function of the population of transitory objects that are in the process of being quenched. Our simple empirical laws for the cessation of star formation in galaxies also naturally produce the "anti-hierarchical" run of mean age with mass for passive galaxies, as well as the qualitative variation of formation timescale indicated by the relative $\alpha$-element abundances.

The KBSS-MOSFIRE sample is representative of star-forming galaxies at these redshifts, with stellar masses M*=10{\^{}}9-10{\^{}}11.5 M{\_}sun and star formation rates SFR=3-1000 M{\_}sun/yr.

Comparisons with observations of typical local galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and between subsamples of KBSS-MOSFIRE show that high-redshift galaxies exhibit a number of significant differences in addition to the well-known offset in log([O III]/H-beta) and log([N II]/H-alpha). We argue that the primary difference between H II regions in z{\~{}}2.3 galaxies and those at z{\~{}}0 is an enhancement in the degree of nebular excitation, as measured by [O III]/H-beta and R23=log[([O III]+[O II])/H-beta]. At the same time, KBSS-MOSFIRE galaxies are {\~{}}10 times more massive than z{\~{}}0 galaxies with similar ionizing spectra and have higher N/O (likely accompanied by higher O/H) at fixed excitation. These results indicate the presence of harder ionizing radiation fields at fixed N/O and O/H relative to typical z{\~{}}0 galaxies, consistent with Fe-poor stellar population models that include massive binaries, and highlight a population of massive, high-specific star formation rate galaxies at high-redshift with systematically different star formation histories than galaxies of similar stellar mass today.},

abstract = {We present the star formation histories of 39 galaxies with high quality rest-frame optical spectra at 0.5{\textless}z{\textless}1.3 selected to have strong Balmer absorption lines and/or Balmer break, and compare to a sample of spectroscopically selected quiescent galaxies at the same redshift. Photometric selection identifies a majority of objects that have clear evidence for a recent short-lived burst of star formation within the last 1.5 Gyr, i.e. "post-starburst" galaxies, however we show that good quality continuum spectra are required to obtain physical parameters such as burst mass fraction and burst age. Dust attenuation appears to be the primary cause for misidentification of post-starburst galaxies, leading to contamination in spectroscopic samples where only the [OII] emission line is available, as well as a small fraction of objects lost from photometric samples. The 31 confirmed post-starburst galaxies have formed 40-90{\%} of their stellar mass in the last 1-1.5 Gyr. We use the derived star formation histories to find that the post-starburst galaxies are visible photometrically for 0.5-1 Gyr. This allows us to update a previous analysis to suggest that 25-50{\%} of the growth of the red sequence at z{\~{}}1 could be caused by a starburst followed by rapid quenching. We use the inferred maximum historical star formation rates of several 100-1000 Msun/yr and updated visibility times to confirm that sub-mm galaxies are likely progenitors of post-starburst galaxies. The short quenching timescales of 100-200 Myr are consistent with cosmological hydrodynamic models in which rapid quenching is caused by the mechanical expulsion of gas due to an AGN.},

We measured star formation rates (SFR) using FIR Herschel/PACS data and we observed the location of AGN and non-AGN galaxies on the main-sequence of star formation. We went a step further in analysing the importance of AGN in quenching star formation in the green valley, the region proposed to be the transitional phase in galaxy evolution where galaxies are moving from later- to earlier-types. We found that most of our green valley X-ray detected AGN with far-IR emission have SFRs higher than the ones of inactive galaxies at fixed stellar mass ranges, the result that is different when considering optical data. These FIR AGN have still very active star formation, being located either on or above the main-sequence of star formation (in total 82$\backslash${\%} of our sample). Therefore, they do not show signs of star formation quenching, but rather its enhancement. Our results may suggest that for X-ray detected AGN with FIR emission if there is an influence of AGN feedback on the star formation in the green valley the scenario of AGN positive feedback seem to take place, rather than the negative one.},

We find that the median light-weighted size of the passive galaxies in the two more evolved clusters is {\$}\backslashsim24\backslash{\%}{\$} larger than for field galaxies, independent of the use of circularized effective radii or semi-major axes. These two clusters also show a smaller size ratio than the less evolved cluster, which we investigate using color gradients to probe the underlying {\$}M{\_}{\{}*{\}}/L{\_}{\{}H{\_}{\{}160{\}}{\}}{\$} gradients. The median color gradients are {\$}\backslashnabla{\{}z-H{\}} \backslashsim-0.4{\$} mag dex{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}, twice the local value. Using stellar populations models, these gradients are best reproduced by a combination of age and metallicity gradients. Our results favor the minor merger scenario as the dominant process responsible for the observed galaxy properties and the environmental differences at this redshift. The environmental differences support that clusters experience accelerated structural evolution compared to the field, likely via an epoch of enhanced minor merger activity during cluster assembly.},

abstract = {We present COSMOS-Drift And SHift (DASH), a Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 imaging survey of the COSMOS field in the H{\_}160 filter. The survey comprises 456 individual WFC3 pointings corresponding to an area of 0.49 deg{\^{}}2 (0.66 deg{\^{}}2 when including archival data) and reaches a 5 point-source limit of H{\_}160 =25.1 (0".3 aperture). COSMOS-DASH is the widest HST/WFC3 imaging survey in H{\_}160 filter, tripling the extragalactic survey area in the near-infrared at HST resolution. We make the reduced H{\_}160 mosaic available to the community. We use this dataset to measure the sizes of 162 galaxies with log(M{\_}star/M{\_}sun) {\textgreater} 11.3 at 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.0, and augment this sample with 748 galaxies at 0.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.5 using archival ACS imaging. We find that the median size of galaxies in this mass range changes with redshift as r{\_}eff = (10.4+/-0.4)(1 +z){\^{}}(0.65+/-0.05) kpc. Separating the galaxies into star forming and quiescent galaxies using their restframe U-V and V-J colors, we find no statistical difference between the median sizes of the most massive star-forming and quiescent galaxies at z = 2.5: they are 4.9+/-0.9 kpc and 4.3 +/-0.3 kpc respectively. However, we do find a significant difference in the S`ersic index between the two samples, such that massive quiescent galaxies have higher central densities than star forming galaxies. We extend the size-mass analysis to lower masses by combining it with the 3D-HST/CANDELS sample of van der Wel et al. (2014), and derive empirical relations between size, mass, and redshift. Fitting a relation of the form r{\_}eff = A m{\_}star{\^{}}a, m{\_}star = M{\_}star/5x10{\^{}}10 M{\_}sun and r{\_}eff in kpc, we find log A = -0.25 log (1 + z) + 0.79 and a = -0.13 log(1 + z) + 0.27. We also provide relations for the subsamples of star forming and quiescent galaxies. Our results confirm previous studies that were based on smaller samples or ground-based imaging.},

abstract = {To understand star formation in galaxies, we investigate the star formation rate (SFR) surface density ({\$}\backslashSigma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm SFR{\}}{\$}) profiles for galaxies, based on a well-defined sample of 976 star-forming MaNGA galaxies. We find that the typical {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm SFR{\}}{\$} profiles within 1.5Re of normal SF galaxies can be well described by an exponential function for different stellar mass intervals, while the sSFR profile shows positive gradients, especially for more massive SF galaxies. This is due to the more pronounced central cores or bulges rather than the onset of a `quenching' process. While galaxies that lie significantly above (or below) the star formation main sequence (SFMS) show overall an elevation (or suppression) of {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm SFR{\}}{\$} at all radii, this central elevation (or suppression) is more pronounced in more massive galaxies. The degree of central enhancement and suppression is quite symmetric, suggesting that both the elevation and suppression of star formation are following the same physical processes. Furthermore, we find that the dispersion in {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm SFR{\}}{\$} within and across the population is found to be tightly correlated with the inferred gas depletion time, whether based on the stellar surface mass density or the orbital dynamical time. This suggests that we are seeing the response of a simple gas-regulator system to variations in the accretion rate. This is explored using a heuristic model that can quantitatively explain the dependence of {\$}\backslashsigma(\backslashSigma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm SFR{\}}){\$} on gas depletion timescale. Variations in accretion rate are progressively more damped out in regions of low star-formation efficiency leading to a reduced amplitude of variations in star-formation. This idea is also supported by re-examination of some other quite independent relations in the literature, including the comparison of compact and extended star-forming galaxies in Wang et al. (2018a).},

abstract = {We investigate the H$\alpha$ and infrared star formation rate (SFR) diagnostics for galaxies in the Nearby Field Galaxy Survey (NFGS). For the 81 galaxies in our sample, we derive H$\alpha$ fluxes (included here) from integrated spectra. There is a strong correlation between the ratio of far-infrared to optical luminosities L(FIR)/L(H$\alpha$) and the extinction E(B-V) measured with the Balmer decrement. Before reddening correction, the SFR(IR) and SFR(H$\alpha$) are related to each other by a power law: SFR(IR)=(2.7+/-0.3)SFR(H$\alpha$)1.30+/-0.06. Correction of the SFR(H$\alpha$) for extinction using the Balmer decrement and a classical reddening curve both reduces the scatter in the SFR(IR)-SFR(H$\alpha$) correlation and results in a much closer agreement between the two SFR indicators; SFR(IR)=(0.91+/-0.04)SFR(H$\alpha$corr)1.07+/-0.03. SFR(IR) and SFR(H$\alpha$) agree to {\~{}}10{\%}. This SFR relationship spans 4 orders of magnitude and holds for all Hubble types with IRAS detections in the NFGS. A constant ratio between the SFR(IR) and SFR(H$\alpha$) for all Hubble types, including early types (S0-Sab), suggests that the IR emission in all these objects results from a young stellar population.},

abstract = {Star-forming galaxies at redshifts z{\textgreater}6 are likely responsible for the reionization of the universe, and it is important to study the nature of these galaxies. We present three candidates for z{\~{}}7 Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs) from a 155 arcmin{\^{}}2 area in the CANDELS/COSMOS field imaged by the deep FourStar Galaxy Evolution (zFourGE) survey. The FourStar medium-band filters provide the equivalent of R{\~{}}10 spectroscopy, which cleanly distinguishes between z{\~{}}7 LBGs and brown dwarf stars. The distinction between stars and galaxies based on an object's angular size can become unreliable even when using HST imaging; there exists at least one very compact z{\~{}}7 candidate (FWHM{\~{}}0.5-1 kpc) that is indistinguishable from a point source. The medium-band filters provide narrower redshift distributions compared with broad-band-derived redshifts. The UV luminosity function derived using the three z{\~{}}7 candidates is consistent with previous studies, suggesting an evolution at the bright end (MUV -21.6 mag) from z{\~{}}7 to z{\~{}}5. Fitting the galaxies' spectral energy distributions, we predict Lyman-alpha equivalent widths for the two brightest LBGs, and find that the presence of a Lyman-alpha line affects the medium-band flux thereby changing the constraints on stellar masses and UV spectral slopes. This illustrates the limitations of deriving LBG properties using only broad-band photometry. The derived specific star-formation rates for the bright LBGs are {\~{}}13 per Gyr, slightly higher than the lower-luminosity LBGs, implying that the star-formation rate increases with stellar mass for these galaxies.},

abstract = {We unveil the complex shape of a proto-supercluster at z ∼ 2.45 in the COSMOS field exploiting the synergy of both spectroscopic and photometric redshifts. Thanks to the spectroscopic redshifts of the VIMOS Ultra-Deep Survey (VUDS), complemented by the zCOSMOS-Deep spectroscopic sample and high-quality photometric redshifts, we compute the three-dimensional (3D) overdensity field in a volume of ∼100 × 100 × 250 comoving Mpc 3 in the central region of the COSMOS field, centred at z ∼ 2.45 along the line of sight. The method relies on a two-dimensional (2D) Voronoi tessellation in overlapping redshift slices that is converted into a 3D density field, where the galaxy distribution in each slice is constructed using a statistical treatment of both spectroscopic and photometric redshifts. In this volume, we identify a proto-supercluster, dubbed “Hyperion” for its immense size and mass, which extends over a volume of ∼60 × 60 × 150 comoving Mpc 3 and has an estimated total mass of ∼4.8 × 10 15 M ⊙ . This immensely complex structure contains at least seven density peaks within 2.4 ≲ z ≲ 2.5 connected by filaments that exceed the average density of the volume. We estimate the total mass of the individual peaks, M tot , based on their inferred average matter density, and find a range of masses from ∼0.1 × 10 14 M ⊙ to ∼2.7 × 10 14 M ⊙ . By using spectroscopic members of each peak, we obtain the velocity dispersion of the galaxies in the peaks, and then their virial mass M vir (under the strong assumption that they are virialised). The agreement between M vir and M tot is surprisingly good, at less than 1−2 $\sigma$ , considering that (almost all) the peaks are probably not yet virialised. According to the spherical collapse model, these peaks have already started or are about to start collapsing, and they are all predicted to be virialised by redshift z ∼ 0.8−1.6. We finally perform a careful comparison with the literature, given that smaller components of this proto-supercluster had previously been identified using either heterogeneous galaxy samples (Ly $\alpha$ emitters, sub-mm starbursting galaxies, CO emitting galaxies) or 3D Ly $\alpha$ forest tomography on a smaller area. With VUDS, we obtain, for the first time across the central ∼1 deg 2 of the COSMOS field, a panoramic view of this large structure, that encompasses, connects, and considerably expands in a homogeneous way on all previous detections of the various sub-components. The characteristics of this exceptional proto-supercluster, its redshift, its richness over a large volume, the clear detection of its sub-components, together with the extensive multi-wavelength imaging and spectroscopy granted by the COSMOS field, provide us the unique possibility to study a rich supercluster in formation.},

A novel plotting scheme conveys the evolution of multiple galaxy properties simultaneously, and dust growth, as well as star-formation decline and quenching, exhibit "mass-accelerated evolution" ("downsizing"). A population of transition galaxies below the star-forming main sequence is identified. These objects are located between star-forming and quiescent galaxies in {\$}UVJ{\$} space and have lower {\$}A{\_}V{\$} and smaller radii than galaxies on the main sequence. Their properties are consistent with their being in transit between the two regions.

abstract = {A common assumption is that galaxies fall in two distinct regions of a plot of specific star formation rate (SSFR) versus galaxy stellar mass: a star-forming galaxy main sequence (GMS) and a separate region of 'passive' or 'red and dead galaxies'. Starting from a volume-limited sample of nearby galaxies designed to contain most of the stellar mass in this volume, and thus representing the end-point of 12 billion years of galaxy evolution, we investigate the distribution of galaxies in this diagram today. We show that galaxies follow a strongly curved extended GMS with a steep negative slope at high galaxy stellar masses. There is a grad-ual change in the morphologies of the galaxies along this distribution, but there is no clear break between early-type and late-type galaxies. Examining the other evidence that there are two distinct populations, we argue that the 'red sequence' is the result of the colours of galaxies changing very little below a critical value of the SSFR, rather than implying a distinct population of galaxies. Herschel observations, which show at least half of early-type galaxies contain a cool interstellar medium, also imply continuity between early-type and late-type galaxies. This picture of a unitary population of galaxies requires more gradual evolutionary processes than the rapid quenching process needed to explain two distinct pop-ulations. We challenge theorists to predict quantitatively the properties of this 'Galaxy End Sequence'.},

abstract = {We present near-infrared spectroscopic confirmations of a sample of 16 photometrically-selected galaxies with stellar masses log(M{\_}star/M{\_}sun) {\textgreater} 11 at redshift z {\textgreater} 3 from the XMM-VIDEO and COSMOS-UltraVISTA fields using Keck/MOSFIRE as part of the MAGAZ3NE survey. Eight of the ultra-massive galaxies (UMGs) have specific star formation rates (sSFR) {\textless} 0.03 Gyr-1, with negligible emission lines. Another seven UMGs show emission lines consistent with active galactic nuclei and/or star formation, while only one UMG has sSFR {\textgreater} 1 Gyr-1. Model star formation histories of these galaxies describe systems that formed the majority of their stars in vigorous bursts of several hundred Myr duration around 4 {\textless} z {\textless} 6during which hundreds to thousands of solar masses were formed per year. These formation ages of {\textless} 1 Gyr prior to observation are consistent with ages derived from measurements of Dn(4000) and EW0(H$\backslash$delta). Rapid quenching followed these bursty star-forming periods, generally occurring less than 350 Myr before observation, resulting in post-starburst SEDs and spectra for half the sample. The rapid formation timescales are consistent with the extreme star formation rates observed in 4 {\textless} z {\textless} 7 dusty starbursts observed with ALMA, suggesting that such dusty galaxies are progenitors of these UMGs. While such formation histories have been suggested in previous studies, the large sample introduced here presents the most compelling evidence yet that vigorous star formation followed by rapid quenching is almost certainly the norm for high mass galaxies in the early universe. The UMGs presented here were selected to be brighter than Ks = 21.7 raising the intriguing possibility that even (fainter) older quiescent UMGs could exist at this epoch.},

abstract = {Quasi-stellar object (QSO) spectral templates are important both to QSO physics and for investigations that use QSOs as probes of intervening gas and dust. However, combinations of various QSO samples obtained at different times and with different instruments so as to expand a composite and to cover a wider rest frame wavelength region may create systematic effects, and the contribution from QSO hosts may contaminate the composite. We have constructed a composite spectrum from luminous blue QSOs at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.1 selected from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The observations with X-shooter simultaneously cover ultraviolet (UV) to near- infrared (NIR) light, which ensures that the composite spectrum covers the full rest-frame range from Ly{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} to 11350 {\$}\backslashAA{\$} without any significant host contamination. Assuming a power-law continuum for the composite we find a spectral slope of {\$}\backslashalpha{\_}\backslashlambda{\$} = 1.70+/-0.01, which is steeper than previously found in the literature. We attribute the differences to our broader spectral wavelength coverage, which allows us to effectively avoid fitting any regions that are affected either by strong QSO emissions lines (e.g., Balmer lines and complex [Fe II] blends) or by intrinsic host galaxy emission. Finally, we demonstrate the application of the QSO composite spectrum for evaluating the reddening in other QSOs.},

abstract = {The Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will observe several Deep Drilling Fields (DDFs) to a greater depth and with a more rapid cadence than the main survey. In this paper, we describe the 'DeepDrill' survey, which used the Spitzer Space Telescope Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) to observe three of the four currently defined DDFs in two bands, centred on 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m. These observations expand the area that was covered by an earlier set of observations in these three fields by the Spitzer Extragalactic Representative Volume Survey (SERVS). The combined DeepDrill and SERVS data cover the footprints of the LSST DDFs in the Extended Chandra Deep Field-South (ECDFS) field, the ELAIS-S1 field (ES1), and the XMM-Large-Scale Structure Survey field (XMM-LSS). The observations reach an approximate 5$\sigma$ point-source depth of 2 $\mu$Jy (corresponding to an AB magnitude of 23.1; sufficient to detect a 1011 M⊙ galaxy out to z ≈ 5) in each of the two bands over a total area of ≈ 29 deg2. The dual-band catalogues contain a total of 2.35 million sources. In this paper, we describe the observations and data products from the survey, and an overview of the properties of galaxies in the survey. We compare the source counts to predictions from the Shark semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. We also identify a population of sources with extremely red ([3.6]-[4.5] {\textgreater}1.2) colours which we show mostly consists of highly obscured active galactic nuclei.},

abstract = {We explore the variation in stellar population ages for Coma cluster galaxies as a function of projected cluster-centric distance, using a sample of 362 red-sequence galaxies with high signal-to-noise ratio spectroscopy. The sample spans a wide range in luminosity (0.02-4L*) and extends from the cluster core to near the virial radius. We find a clear distinction in the observed trends of the giant and dwarf galaxies. The ages of red-sequence giants are primarily determined by galaxy mass, whether parametrized by velocity dispersion, luminosity, stellar mass or dynamical mass, with only weak modulation by environment, in the sense that galaxies at larger cluster-centric distance are slightly younger. For red-sequence dwarfs (with mass ≲ 10 10M ⊙), the roles of mass and environment as predictors of age are reversed: there is little dependence on mass, but strong trends with projected cluster-centric radius are observed. The average age of dwarfs at the 2.5Mpc limit of our sample is approximately half that of dwarfs near the cluster centre. The gradient in dwarf galaxy ages is a global cluster-centric trend, and is not driven by the ongoing merger of the NGC 4839 group to the south west of Coma. We interpret these results using environmental histories extracted from the Millennium Simulation for members of massive clusters. Hierarchical cluster assembly naturally leads to trends in the accretion times of galaxies as a function of projected cluster-centric radius. On average, simulated galaxies now located in cluster cores joined haloes above any given mass threshold earlier than those now in the outskirts of clusters. We test environmental quenching models, in which star formation is halted in galaxies when they enter haloes of a given mass, or when they become satellites. Our models broadly reproduce the gradients observed in Coma, but for dwarf galaxies the efficiency of environmental quenching must be very high to match the strong trends observed. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society {\textcopyright} 2011 RAS.},

abstract = {Recent observations have revealed massive galactic molecular outflows 1–3 that may have the physical conditions (high gas densities 4–6) required to form stars. Indeed, several recent models predict that such massive outflows may ignite star formation within the outflow itself 7–11 . This star-formation mode, in which stars form with high radial velocities, could contribute to the morphological evolution of galaxies 12 , to the evolution in size and velocity dispersion of the spheroidal component of galaxies 11,13 , and would contribute to the population of high-velocity stars, which could even escape the galaxy 13 . Such star formation could provide in situ chemical enrichment of the circumgalactic and intergalactic medium (through supernova explosions of young stars on large orbits), and some models also predict it to contribute substantially to the star-formation rate observed in distant galaxies 9 . Although there exists observational evidence for star formation triggered by outflows or jets into their host galaxy, as a consequence of gas compression, evidence for star formation occurring within galactic outflows is still missing. Here we report spectroscopic observations that unambiguously reveal star formation occurring in a galactic outflow at a redshift of 0.0448. The inferred star-formation rate in the outflow is larger than 15 solar masses per year. Star formation may also be occurring in other galactic outflows, but may have been missed by previous observations owing to the lack of adequate diagnostics 14,15 . IRAS F23128−5919 is a merging system (Fig. 1a), in which the south-ern nucleus hosts an obscured active galactic nucleus (AGN), detected in the X-rays 16 . Past observations had already revealed a prominent outflow developing from the southern nucleus 14,15,17–19 , driven by the nuclear starburst, or by the AGN, or both. We analysed archival Very Large Telescope (VLT) spectroscopic observations, obtained with the MUSE instrument, of the optical nebular lines to characterize the out-flow better. The nebular emission line profiles can be separated clearly into a narrow component, associated with the interstellar medium in the two galactic disks, and a very broad (full-width at half-maximum, FWHM ≈ 600–1,000 km s −1},

abstract = {We compare the star forming main sequence (SFMS) -- both integrated and resolved on 1kpc scales -- between the high-resolution TNG50 simulation of IllustrisTNG and observations from the 3D-HST slitless spectroscopic survey at z{\~{}}1. Contrasting integrated star formation rates (SFRs), we find that the slope and normalization of the star-forming main sequence in TNG50 are quantitatively consistent with values derived by fitting observations from 3D-HST with the Prospector Bayesian inference framework. The previous offsets of 0.2-1dex between observed and simulated main sequence normalizations are resolved when using the updated masses and SFRs from Prospector. The scatter is generically smaller in TNG50 than in 3D-HST for more massive galaxies with M{\_}*{\textgreater}10{\^{}}10Msun, even after accounting for observational uncertainties. When comparing resolved star formation, we also find good agreement between TNG50 and 3D-HST: average specific star formation rate (sSFR) radial profiles of galaxies at all masses and radii below, on, and above the SFMS are similar in both normalization and shape. Most noteworthy, massive galaxies with M{\_}*{\textgreater}10{\^{}}10.5Msun, which have fallen below the SFMS due to ongoing quenching, exhibit a clear central SFR suppression, in both TNG50 and 3D-HST. In TNG this inside-out quenching is due to the supermassive black hole (SMBH) feedback model operating at low accretion rates. In contrast, the original Illustris simulation, without this same physical SMBH mechanism, does not reproduce the central SFR profile suppression seen in data. The observed sSFR profiles provide support for the TNG quenching mechanism and how it affects gas on kiloparsec scales in the centers of galaxies.},

Together, this unique data set sheds light on how the assembled stellar mass is distributed within galaxies, and where new stars are being formed. We find the Halpha morphologies to resemble more closely those observed in the ACS I band than in the WFC3 H band, especially for the larger systems. We next derive a novel prescription for Halpha dust corrections, which accounts for extra extinction towards HII regions. The prescription leads to consistent SFR estimates and reproduces the observed relation between the Halpha/UV luminosity ratio and visual extinction, both on a pixel-by-pixel and on a galaxy-integrated level. We find the surface density of star formation to correlate with the surface density of assembled stellar mass for spatially resolved regions within galaxies, akin to the so-called 'main sequence of star formation' established on a galaxy-integrated level. Deviations from this relation towards lower equivalent widths are found in the inner regions of galaxies. Clumps and spiral features, on the other hand, are associated with enhanced Halpha equivalent widths, bluer colors, and higher specific star formation rates compared to the underlying disk. Their Halpha/UV luminosity ratio is lower than that of the underlying disk, suggesting the ACS clump selection preferentially picks up those regions of elevated star formation activity that are the least obscured by dust. Our analysis emphasizes that monochromatic studies of galaxy structure can be severely limited by mass-to-light ratio variations due to dust and spatially inhomogeneous star formation histories.},

Feedback processes, such as outflowing winds driven by radiation pressure, supernovae, or supermassive black hole accretion, can act to halt star formation if they heat or expel the gas supply. We report a molecular outflow launched from a dust-rich star-forming galaxy at redshift 5.3, 1 billion years after the Big Bang. The outflow reaches velocities up to 800 kilometers per second relative to the galaxy, is resolved into multiple clumps, and carries mass at a rate within a factor of 2 of the star formation rate. Our results show that molecular outflows can remove a large fraction of the gas available for star formation from galaxies at high redshift.},

abstract = {{The Supernova Cosmology Project has discovered over twenty-eight supernovae (SNe) at 0.35 {\textless}z {\textless} 0.65 in an ongoing program that uses Type Ia SNe as high-redshift distance indicators. Here we present measurements of the ratio between the locally observed and global Hubble constants, H{\_}0{\^{}}L/H{\_}0{\^{}}G, based on the first 7 SNe of this high-redshift data set compared with 18 SNe at z {\textless}= 0.1 from the Calan/Tololo survey. If Omega{\_}M {\textless}= 1, then light-curve-width corrected SN magnitudes yield H{\_}0{\^{}}L/H{\_}0{\^{}}G {\textless} 1.10 (95{\%} confidence level) in both a Lambda=0 and a flat universe. The analysis using the SNe Ia as standard candles without a light-curve-width correction yields similar results. These results rule out the hypothesis that the discrepant ages of the Universe derived from globular clusters and recent measurements of the Hubble constant are attributable to a locally underdense bubble. Using the Cepheid-distance-calibrated absolute magnitudes for SNe Ia of Sandage (1996{\}}, we can also measure the global Hubble constant, H{\_}0{\^{}}G. If Omega{\_}M {\textgreater}= 0.2, we find that H{\_}0{\^{}}G {\textless} 70 km/s/Mpc in a Lambda=0 universe and H{\_}0{\^{}}G {\textless} 78 km/s/Mpc in a flat universe, correcting the distant and local SN apparent magnitudes for light curve width. Lower results for H{\_}0{\^{}}G are obtained if the magnitudes are not width corrected.},

abstract = {We present the first study of the large-scale clustering of post-starburst (PSB) galaxies in the high redshift Universe ({\$}0.5{\textless}z{\textless}3.0{\$}). We select {\$}\backslashsim4000{\$} PSB galaxies photometrically, the largest high-redshift sample of this kind, from two deep large-scale near-infrared surveys: the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey (UDS) DR11 and the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS). Using angular cross-correlation techniques, we estimate the halo masses for this large sample of PSB galaxies and compare them with quiescent and star-forming galaxies selected in the same fields. We find that low-mass, low-redshift ({\$}0.5{\textless}z{\textless}1.0{\$}) PSB galaxies preferentially reside in very high-mass dark matter halos (M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}halo{\}}{\}}{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}14{\}}{\$}M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}), suggesting they are likely to be infalling satellite galaxies in cluster-like environments. High-mass PSB galaxies are more weakly clustered at low redshifts, but they reside in higher mass haloes with increasing look-back time, suggesting strong redshift-dependent halo downsizing. These key results are consistent with previous results suggesting that two main channels are responsible for the rapid quenching of galaxies. While high-redshift ({\$}z{\textgreater}1{\$}) galaxies appear to be quenched by secular feedback mechanisms, processes associated with dense environments are likely to be the key driver of rapid quenching in the low-redshift Universe ({\$}z{\textless}1{\$}). Finally, we show that the clustering of photometrically selected PSBs are consistent with them being direct descendants of highly dust-enshrouded sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs), providing tantalising evidence for the oft-speculated evolutionary pathway from starburst to quiescence.},

abstract = {We derive the recent star formation histories of 23 active dwarf galaxies using HST observations from the Legacy Extragalactic UV Survey (LEGUS). We apply a color-magnitude diagram fitting technique using two independent sets of stellar models, PARSEC-COLIBRI and MIST. Despite the non-negligible recent activity, none of the 23 star forming dwarfs show enhancements in the last 100 Myr larger than three times the 100-Myr-average. The unweighted mean of the individual SFHs in the last 100 Myr is also consistent with a rather constant activity, irrespective of the atomic gas fraction. We confirm previous results that for dwarf galaxies the CMD-based average star formation rates (SFRs) are generally higher than the FUV-based SFR. For half of the sample, the 60-Myr-average CMD-based SFR is more than two times the FUV SFR. In contrast, we find remarkable agreement between the 10-Myr-average CMD-based SFR and the H{\$}{\{}\backslashalpha{\}}{\$}-based SFR. Finally, using core helium burning stars of intermediate mass we study the pattern of star formation spatial progression over the past 60 Myr, and speculate on the possible triggers and connections of the star formation activity with the environment in which these galaxies live. Approximately half of our galaxies show spatial progression of star formation in the last 60 Myr, and/or very recent diffuse and off-center activity compared to RGB stars.},

From a sample of {\~{}}500 confirmed cluster members, we isolate 46 E+A candidates to determine the E+A fraction and study their physical properties. Spectral types are assigned using Balmer (H{\{}$\delta${\}}, H{\{}$\gamma${\}}, H{\{}$\beta${\}}) and [O II] {\{}$\lambda${\}}3727 equivalent widths. For all members, we have galaxy colors, luminosities, Hubble types, and quantitative structural parameters. We also include measured internal velocity dispersions for 120 cluster members and estimate velocity dispersions for the rest of the cluster sample using the fundamental plane. We find that E+A galaxies comprise a nonnegligible component ({\~{}}7{\%}-13{\%}) of the cluster population at these redshifts, and their diverse nature indicates a heterogeneous parent population. While cluster E+A's are predominantly disk-dominated systems, they span the range in Hubble type and bulge-to-total fraction to include even early-type members. Cluster E+A's also cover a wide range in luminosity [L{\_}{\{}B{\}}{\~{}}(0.2-2.5)L{\^{}}{\{}*{\}}{\_}{\{}B{\}}], internal velocity dispersion ({\{}$\sigma${\}}{\~{}}30-220 km s{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}), and half-light radius [r{\_}{\{}1/2{\}}{\~{}}(0.4-4.3)h{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} kpc]. From their velocity dispersions and half-light radii, we infer that the descendants of E+A's in our highest redshift cluster are massive early-type galaxies. In contrast to the wide range of luminosity and internal velocity dispersion spanned by E+A's at higher redshift, only low-mass E+A's are found in nearby clusters, e.g., Coma. The observed decrease in the characteristic E+A mass is similar to the decrease in the luminosity of rapidly star-forming field galaxies since z{\~{}}1, i.e., galaxy ``downsizing.'' In addition, we argue that our statistics imply that {\{}$\backslash$gt{\}}{\~{}}30{\%} of the E-S0 members have undergone an E+A phase; the true fraction could be 100{\%} if the effects of E+A downsizing, an increasing E+A fraction with redshift, and the conversion of spiral galaxies into early type galaxies are also considered. Thus, the E+A phase may indeed be an important stage in the transformation of star-forming galaxies into early-type members.

abstract = {We present a robust method to constrain average galaxy star formation rates (SFRs), star formation histories (SFHs), and the intracluster light (ICL) as a function of halo mass. Our results are consistent with observed galaxy stellar mass functions, specific star formation rates (SSFRs), and cosmic star formation rates (CSFRs) from z = 0 to z = 8. We consider the effects of a wide range of uncertainties on our results, including those affecting stellar masses, SFRs, and the halo mass function at the heart of our analysis. As they are relevant to our method, we also present new calibrations of the dark matter halo mass function, halo mass accretion histories, and halo-subhalo merger rates out to z = 8. We also provide new compilations of CSFRs and SSFRs; more recent measurements are now consistent with the buildup of the cosmic stellar mass density at all redshifts. Implications of our work include: halos near 1012 M ⊙ are the most efficient at forming stars at all redshifts, the baryon conversion efficiency of massive halos drops markedly after z {\~{}} 2.5 (consistent with theories of cold-mode accretion), the ICL for massive galaxies is expected to be significant out to at least z {\~{}} 1-1.5, and dwarf galaxies at low redshifts have higher stellar mass to halo mass ratios than previous expectations and form later than in most theoretical models. Finally, we provide new fitting formulae for SFHs that are more accurate than the standard declining tau model. Our approach places a wide variety of observations relating to the SFH of galaxies into a self-consistent framework based on the modern understanding of structure formation in $\Lambda$CDM.

abstract = {We present an analysis of the quenching of star formation in galaxies, bulges, and disks throughout the bulk of cosmic history, from {\$}z=2-0{\$}. We utilise observations from the SDSS and MaNGA at low redshifts. We complement these data with observations from CANDELS at high redshifts. Additionally, we compare the observations to detailed predictions from the LGalaxies semi-analytic model. To analyse the data, we developed a machine learning approach utilising a Random Forest classifier. We first demonstrate that this technique is extremely effective at extracting causal insight from highly complex and inter-correlated model data, before applying it to various observational surveys. Our primary observational results are as follows: At all redshifts studied in this work, we find bulge mass to be the most predictive parameter of quenching, out of the photometric parameter set (incorporating bulge mass, disk mass, total stellar mass, and {\$}B/T{\$} structure). Moreover, we also find bulge mass to be the most predictive parameter of quenching in both bulge and disk structures, treated separately. Hence, intrinsic galaxy quenching must be due to a stable mechanism operating over cosmic time, and the same quenching mechanism must be effective in both bulge and disk regions. Despite the success of bulge mass in predicting quenching, we find that central velocity dispersion is even more predictive (when available in spectroscopic data sets). In comparison to the LGalaxies model, we find that all of these observational results may be consistently explained through quenching via preventative `radio-mode' active galactic nucleus (AGN) feedback. Furthermore, many alternative quenching mechanisms (including virial shocks, supernova feedback, and morphological stabilisation) are found to be inconsistent with our observational results and those from the literature.},

For a strategic survey of such galaxies and the interpretation of the obtained data, this paper presents an ultraviolet-to-optical spectral model of galaxies with a great care of the nebular emission. In particular, we present a machine-readable table of intensities of 119 nebular emission lines from Ly$\alpha$ to the rest-frame 1 ?m as a function of metallicity from zero to the solar one. Based on the spectral model, we present criteria of equivalent widths of Ly$\alpha$, He II$\lambda$1640, H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and [O III]$\lambda$5007 to select extremely metal-poor and metal-free galaxies although these criteria have uncertainty caused by the Lyman continuum escape fraction and the star formation duration. We also present criteria of broad-band colours which will be useful to select candidates for spectroscopic follow-up from drop-out galaxies. We propose the line intensity ratio of [O III]$\lambda$5007 to H$\beta$ {\textless} 0.1 as the most robust criterion for {\textless}1/1000 of the solar metallicity. This ratio of a galaxy with a few Mȯ yr-1 at z˜ 8 is detectable by spectroscopy with the James Webb Space Telescope within a reasonable exposure time.},

abstract = {We study the IR-through-UV interstellar extinction curves towards 328 Galactic B and late-O stars. We use a new technique which employs stellar atmosphere models in lieu of unreddened "standard" stars. This technique is capable of virtually eliminating spectral mismatch errors in the curves. It also allows a quantitative assessment of the errors and enables a rigorous testing of the significance of relationships between various curve parameters, regardless of whether their uncertainties are correlated. Analysis of the curves gives the following results: (1) In accord with our previous findings, the central position of the 2175 A extinction bump is mildly variable, its width is highly variable, and the two variations are unrelated. (2) Strong correlations are found among some extinction properties within the UV region, and within the IR region. (3) With the exception of a few curves with extreme (i.e., large) values of R(V), the UV and IR portions of Galactic extinction curves are not correlated with each other. (4) The large sightline-to-sightline variation seen in our sample implies that any average Galactic extinction curve will always reflect the biases of its parent sample. (5) The use of an average curve to deredden a spectral energy distribution (SED) will result in significant errors, and a realistic error budget for the dereddened SED must include the observed variance of Galactic curves. While the observed large sightline-to-sightline variations, and the lack of correlation among the various features of the curves, make it difficult to meaningfully characterize average extinction properties, they demonstrate that extinction curves respond sensitively to local conditions. Thus, each curve contains potentially unique information about the grains along its sightline.},

abstract = {(abridged) Using a complete sample of {\~{}}300 star-forming galaxies within 11 Mpc, we evaluate the consistency between star formation rates (SFRs) inferred from the far ultraviolet (FUV) non-ionizing continuum and H-alpha nebular emission, assuming standard conversion recipes in which the SFR scales linearly with luminosity at a given wavelength. Our analysis probes SFRs over 5 orders of magnitude, down to ultra-low activities on the order of {\~{}}0.0001 M{\_}sun/yr. The data are drawn from the 11 Mpc H-alpha and Ultraviolet Galaxy Survey (11HUGS), which has obtained H-alpha fluxes from ground-based narrowband imaging, and UV fluxes from imaging with GALEX. For normal spiral galaxies (SFR{\~{}}1 M{\_}sun/yr), our results are consistent with previous work which has shown that FUV SFRs tend to be lower than H-alpha SFRs before accounting for internal dust attenuation, but that there is relative consistency between the two tracers after proper corrections are applied. However, a puzzle is encountered at the faint end of the luminosity function. As lower luminosity dwarf galaxies, roughly less active than the Small Magellanic Cloud, are examined, H-alpha tends to increasingly under-predict the SFR relative to the FUV. Although past studies have suggested similar trends, this is the first time this effect is probed with a statistical sample for galaxies with SFR{\~{}}{\textless}0.1 M{\_}sun/yr. A range of standard explanations does not appear to be able to account for the magnitude of the systematic. Some recent work has argued for an IMF which is deficient in high mass stars in dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies, and we also consider this scenario.},

abstract = {We examine the growth and evolution of quenched galaxies in the MUFASA cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include an evolving halo mass-based quenching prescription, with galaxy colours computed accounting for line-of-sight extinction to individual star particles. MUFASA reproduces the observed present-day red sequence reasonably well, including its slope, amplitude and scatter. In MUFASA, the red sequence slope is driven entirely by the steep stellar mass-stellar metallicity relation, which independently agrees with observations. High-mass star-forming galaxies blend smoothly on to the red sequence, indicating the lack of a well-defined green valley at M* ≳ 1010.5M⊙. The most massive galaxies quench the earliest and then grow very little in mass via dry merging; they attain their high masses at earlier epochs when cold inflows more effectively penetrate hot haloes. To higher redshifts, the red sequence becomes increasingly contaminated with massive dusty star-forming (SF) galaxies; UVJ selection subtly but effectively separates these populations. We then examine the evolution of the mass functions of central and satellite galaxies split into passive and star-forming via UVJ. Massive quenched systems show good agreement with observations out to z {\~{}} 2, despite not including a rapid early quenching mode associated with mergers. However, low-mass quenched galaxies are far too numerous at z ≲ 1 in MUFASA, indicating that MUFASA strongly overquenches satellites. A challenge for hydrodynamic simulations is to devise a quenching model that produces enough early massive quenched galaxies and keeps them quenched to z = 0, while not being so strong as to overquench satellites; MUFASA's current scheme fails at the latter.},

We examine the number of spiral arms, their relative pitch angle, and the presence of a galactic bar in the disk, and show that both the slope and dispersion of the M-SFR relation is constant when varying all the above parameters. We also show that mergers (both major and minor), which represent the strongest conditions for increases in star formation at a constant mass, only boost the SFR above the main relation by {\~{}}0.3 dex; this is significantly smaller than the increase seen in merging systems at z{\textgreater}1. Of the galaxies lying significantly above the M-SFR relation in the local Universe, more than 50{\%} are mergers. We interpret this as evidence that the spiral arms, which are imperfect reflections of the galaxy's current gravitational potential, are either fully independent of the various quenching mechanisms or are completely overwhelmed by the combination of outflows and feedback. The arrangement of the star formation can be changed, but the system as a whole regulates itself even in the presence of strong dynamical forcing.},

A galaxy class recently discovered in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, the UFDs appear to be an extension of the classical dwarf spheroidals to low luminosities, offering a new front in efforts to understand the missing satellite problem. They are the least luminous, most dark-matter dominated, and least chemically-evolved galaxies known. Our HST survey of six UFDs seeks to determine if these galaxies are true fossils from the early universe. We present here the preliminary analysis of three UFD galaxies: Hercules, Leo IV, and Ursa Major I. Classical dwarf spheroidals of the Local Group exhibit extended star formation histories, but these three Milky Way satellites are at least as old as the ancient globular cluster M92, with no evidence for intermediate-age populations. Their ages also appear to be synchronized to within {\~{}}1 Gyr of each other, as might be expected if their star formation was truncated by a global event, such as reionization.},

Excluding the most heavily-obscured sources, we use a stacking analysis to show that z{\~{}}2.5 star-forming galaxies in the mass range 9.25 {\textless}= log(M/Msun) {\textless}= 10.75 are fully consistent with the IRX-beta relation expected for a relatively grey attenuation curve, similar to the commonly adopted Calzetti law. Based on a large, mass complete, sample of 2 {\textless}= z {\textless}= 3 star-forming galaxies drawn from multiple surveys, we proceed to derive a new empirical relationship between beta and stellar mass, making it possible to predict UV attenuation (A{\_}1600) and IRX as a function of stellar mass, for any assumed attenuation law. Once again, we find that z{\~{}}2.5 star-forming galaxies follow A{\_}1600-mass and IRX-mass relations consistent with a relatively grey attenuation law, and find no compelling evidence that star-forming galaxies at this epoch follow a reddening law as steep as the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) extinction curve. In fact, we use a simple simulation to demonstrate that previous determinations of the IRX-beta relation may have been biased toward low values of IRX at red values of beta, mimicking the signature expected for an SMC-like dust law. We show that this provides a plausible mechanism for reconciling apparently contradictory results in the literature and that, based on typical measurement uncertainties, stellar mass provides a cleaner prediction of UV attenuation than beta. Although the situation at lower stellar masses remains uncertain, we conclude that for 2{\textless}z{\textless}3 star-forming galaxies with log(M/Msun) {\textgreater}= 9.75, both the IRX-beta and IRX-mass relations are well described by a Calzetti-like attenuation law.},

We have used both single-Sersic and bulge+disk models, have investigated the errors/biases introduced by uncertainties in the background and the PSF, and have obtained formally-acceptable model fits to {\textgreater}90{\%} of the galaxies. Our results indicate that these massive galaxies at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 3 lie both on and below the local size-mass relation, with a median R{\_}e{\~{}}2.6 kpc, a factor of {\~{}}2.3 smaller than comparably-massive local galaxies. Moreover, we find that bulge-dominated objects in particular show evidence for a growing bimodality in the size-mass relation with increasing z, and by z {\textgreater} 2 the compact bulges display effective radii a factor {\~{}}4 smaller than local ellipticals of comparable mass. These trends appear to extend to the bulge components of disk-dominated galaxies, and vice versa. We also find that, while such massive galaxies at low z are bulge-dominated, at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2 they are predominantly mixed bulge+disk systems, and by z {\textgreater} 2 they are mostly disk-dominated. The majority of the disk-dominated galaxies are actively forming stars, but this is also true for many of the bulge-dominated systems. Interestingly, however, while most of the quiescent galaxies are bulge-dominated, we find that a significant fraction (25-40{\%}) of the most quiescent galaxies have disk-dominated morphologies. Thus, while our results show that the massive galaxy population is undergoing dramatic changes at this crucial epoch, they also suggest that the physical mechanisms which quench star-formation activity are not simply connected to those responsible for the morphological transformation of massive galaxies into present-day giant ellipticals.},

In this manuscript, we discuss the pitfalls involved in using reduced chi-squared. There are two independent problems: (a) The number of degrees of freedom can only be estimated for linear models. Concerning nonlinear models, the number of degrees of freedom is unknown, i.e., it is not possible to compute the value of reduced chi-squared. (b) Due to random noise in the data, also the value of reduced chi-squared itself is subject to noise, i.e., the value is uncertain. This uncertainty impairs the usefulness of reduced chi-squared for differentiating between models or assessing convergence of a minimisation procedure. The impact of noise on the value of reduced chi-squared is surprisingly large, in particular for small data sets, which are very common in astrophysical problems. We conclude that reduced chi-squared can only be used with due caution for linear models, whereas it must not be used for nonlinear models at all. Finally, we recommend more sophisticated and reliable methods, which are also applicable to nonlinear models.},

abstract = {Hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation have now reached sufficient volume to make precision predictions for clustering on cosmologically relevant scales. Here we use our new IllustrisTNG simulations to study the non-linear correlation functions and power spectra of baryons, dark matter, galaxies and haloes over an exceptionally large range of scales. We find that baryonic effects increase the clustering of dark matter on small scales and damp the total matter power spectrum on scales up to k {\~{}} 10 h/Mpc by 20{\%}. The non-linear two-point correlation function of the stellar mass is close to a power-law over a wide range of scales and approximately invariant in time from very high redshift to the present. The two-point correlation function of the simulated galaxies agrees well with SDSS at its mean redshift z {\~{}} 0.1, both as a function of stellar mass and when split according to galaxy colour, apart from a mild excess in the clustering of red galaxies in the stellar mass range 10{\^{}}9-10{\^{}}10 Msun/h{\^{}}2. Given this agreement, the TNG simulations can make valuable theoretical predictions for the clustering bias of different galaxy samples. We find that the clustering length of the galaxy auto-correlation function depends strongly on stellar mass and redshift. Its power-law slope gamma is nearly invariant with stellar mass, but declines from gamma {\~{}} 1.8 at redshift z=0 to gamma {\~{}} 1.6 at redshift z {\~{}} 1, beyond which the slope steepens again. We detect significant scale-dependencies in the bias of different observational tracers of large-scale structure, extending well into the range of the baryonic acoustic oscillations and causing nominal (yet fortunately correctable) shifts of the acoustic peaks of around {\~{}}5{\%}.},

abstract = {We present a near-infrared (0.9-2.4 $\mu$m) spectroscopic study of 73 field ultracool dwarfs having spectroscopic and/or kinematic evidence of youth (10-300 Myr). Our sample is composed of 48 low-resolution (R 100) spectra and 41 moderate-resolution spectra (R ≳ 750-2000). First, we establish a method for spectral typing M5-L7 dwarfs at near-IR wavelengths that is independent of gravity. We find that both visual and index-based classification in the near-IR provides consistent spectral types with optical spectral types, though with a small systematic offset in the case of visual classification at J and K band. Second, we examine features in the spectra of 10 Myr ultracool dwarfs to define a set of gravity-sensitive indices based on FeH, VO, K I, Na I, and H-band continuum shape. We then create an index-based method for classifying the gravities of M6-L5 dwarfs that provides consistent results with gravity classifications from optical spectroscopy. Our index-based classification can distinguish between young and dusty objects. Guided by the resulting classifications, we propose a set of low-gravity spectral standards for the near-IR. Finally, we estimate the ages corresponding to our gravity classifications. {\textcopyright} 2013 The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {We examine the evolution of intrinsic u-r colours of galaxies in the EAGLE cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which has been shown to reproduce the observed redshift z=0.1 colour-magnitude distribution well. The median u-r of star-forming ('blue cloud') galaxies reddens by 1 mag from z=2 to 0 at fixed stellar mass, as their specific star formation rates decrease with time. A red sequence starts to build-up around z=1, due to the quenching of low-mass satellite galaxies at the faint end, and due to the quenching of more massive central galaxies by their active galactic nuclei (AGN) at the bright end. This leaves a dearth of intermediate-mass red sequence galaxies at z=1, which is mostly filled in by z=0. We quantify the time-scales of colour transition due to satellite and AGN quenching, finding that most galaxies spend less than 2 Gyr in the 'green valley'. On examining the trajectories of galaxies in a colour-stellar mass diagram, we identify three characteristic tracks that galaxies follow (quiescently star-forming, quenching and rejuvenating galaxies) and quantify the fraction of galaxies that follow each track.},

The sample we have analyzed in this paper is composed of 96 galaxies observed with ALMA at 890 {\textless}i{\textgreater}$\mu${\textless}i/{\textgreater}m (180 {\textless}i{\textgreater}$\mu${\textless}i/{\textgreater}m rest-frame) with an on-source integration time of 1.3 min per galaxy. We detected 32{\%} of the sample at more than 3{\textless}i{\textgreater}$\sigma${\textless}i/{\textgreater} significance. Using the stacked ALMA and {\textless}i{\textgreater}Herschel {\textless}i/{\textgreater}photometry, we derived an average dust temperature of 40 ± 2 K for the whole sample, and extrapolate the {\textless}i{\textgreater}L{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}IR{\textless}sub/{\textgreater} and SFR for all our galaxies based on their ALMA flux. We then used a forward modeling approach to estimate their intrinsic sSFR distribution, deconvolved of measurement errors and selection effects: we find a linear relation between SFR and {\textless}i{\textgreater}M{\textless}i/{\textgreater}{\textless}sub{\textgreater}∗{\textless}sub/{\textgreater}, with a median sSFR = 2.8 ± 0.8 Gyr and a dispersion around that relation of 0.28 ± 0.13 dex. This latter value is consistent with that measured at lower redshifts, which is proof that the main sequence of star-forming galaxies was already in place at {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 4, at least among massive galaxies. These new constraints on the properties of the main sequence are in good agreement with the latest predictions from numerical simulations, and suggest that the bulk of star formation in galaxies is driven by the same mechanism from {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 4 to the present day, that is, over at least 90{\%} of the cosmic history. We also discuss the consequences of our results on the population of early quiescent galaxies. This paper is part of a series that will employ these new ALMA observations to explore the star formation and dust properties of the massive end of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}z{\textless}i/{\textgreater} = 4 galaxy population.},

Illustris is an N-body/hydrodynamical simulation that evolves 2 × 18203 resolution elements in a (106.5Mpc)3 box from cosmological initial conditions down to z = 0 using the AREPO moving-mesh code. The simulation uses a state-of-the-art set of physical models for galaxy formation that was tuned to reproduce the z = 0 stellar mass function and the history of the cosmic star formation rate density. We find that Illustris successfully reproduces a plethora of observations of galaxy populations at various redshifts, for which no tuning was performed, and provide predictions for future observations. In particular, we discuss (a) the buildup of galactic mass, showing stellar mass functions and the relations between stellar mass and halo mass from z = 7 to 0, (b) galaxy number density profiles around massive central galaxies out to z = 4, (c) the gas and total baryon content of both galaxies and their haloes for different redshifts, and as a function of mass and radius, and (d) the evolution of galaxy specific star formation rates up to z = 8. In addition, we (i) present a qualitative analysis of galaxy morphologies from z = 5 to 0, for the stellar as well as the gaseous components, and their appearance in Hubble Space Telescope mock observations, (ii) follow galaxies selected at z = 2 to their z = 0 descendants, and quantify their growth and merger histories, and (iii) track massive z = 0 galaxies to high redshift and study their joint evolution in star formation activity and compactness. We conclude with a discussion of several disagreements with observations, and lay out possible directions for future research.},

abstract = {The identification of high-redshift massive galaxies with old stellar populations may pose challenges to some models of galaxy formation. However, to securely classify a galaxy as quiescent, it is necessary to exclude significant ongoing star formation, something that can be challenging to achieve at high redshift. In this letter, we analyse deep ALMA/870um and SCUBA-2/450um imaging of the claimed "post-starburst" galaxy ZF-20115 at z=3.717 that exhibits a strong Balmer break and absorption lines. The far-infrared imaging reveals a luminous starburst located 0.4+/-0.1 arcsec ({\~{}}3kpc in projection) from the position of the rest-frame ultra-violet/optical emission, with an obscured star-formation rate of 100 Mo/yr. This star-forming component is undetected in the rest-frame ultraviolet but contributes significantly to the lower angular resolution photometry at restframe wavelengths {\textgreater}3500A, significantly complicating the determination of a reliable stellar mass. Importantly, in the presence of dust obscuration, strong Balmer features are not a unique signature of a post-starburst galaxy and are indeed frequently observed in infrared-luminous galaxies. We conclude that the ZF20015 system does not pose a challenge to current models of galaxy formation and that deep sub-/millimeter observations are a prerequisite for any claims of quiescence. The multi-wavelength observations of ZF20115 unveil a complex system with an intricate and spatially-varying star-formation history. ZF20115 demonstrates that understanding high-redshift obscured starbursts will only be possible with multi-wavelength studies that include high-resolution observations, available with the JWST, at mid-infrared wavelengths.},

abstract = {We present an investigation about the shape of the initial mass function (IMF) of early-type galaxies (ETGs), based on a joint lensing and dynamical analysis, and on stellar population synthesis models, for a sample of 55 lens ETGs identified by the Sloan Lens Advanced Camera for Surveys (SLACS). We construct axisymmetric dynamical models based on the Jeans equations which allow for orbital anisotropy and include a dark matter halo. The models reproduce in detail the observed Hubble Space Telescope photometry and are constrained by the total projected mass within the Einstein radius and the stellar velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey fibres. Comparing the dynamically-derived stellar mass-to-light ratios (M*/L)dyn, obtained for an assumed halo slope $\rho$h ∝ r-1, to the stellar population ones (M*/L)Salp, derived from full-spectrum fitting and assuming a Salpeter IMF, we infer the mass normalization of the IMF. Our results confirm the previous analysis by the SLACS team that the mass normalization of the IMF of high-$\sigma$ galaxies is consistent on average with a Salpeter slope. Our study allows for a fully consistent study of the trend between IMF and $\sigma$ for both the SLACS and atlas3D samples, which explore quite different $\sigma$ ranges. The two samples are highly complementary, the first being essentially $\sigma$ selected, and the latter volumelimited and nearly mass selected. We find that the two samples merge smoothly into a single trend of the form log $\alpha$ = (0.38 ± 0.04) × log ($\sigma$e/200 km s-1) + ( - 0.06 ± 0.01), where $\alpha$ = (M*/L)dyn/(M*/L)Salp and $\sigma$e is the luminosity averaged $\sigma$ within one effective radius Re. This is consistent with a systematic variation of the IMF normalization from Kroupa to Salpeter in the interval $\sigma$e ≈ 90-270 km s-1.},

Our models agree well with results from other photoionization models and are able to reproduce observed emission from H II regions and star-forming galaxies. Our models show improved agreement with the observed H II regions in the Ne III/O II plane and show satisfactory agreement with He II emission from {\$}z=2{\$} galaxies when including rotating stellar models. Models including post-asymptotic giant branch stars are able to reproduce line ratios consistent with low-ionization emission regions (LIERs).},

abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the universe is one of the most profound discoveries in modern cosmology, pointing to a universe in which 70{\%} of the mass-energy density has an unknown form spread uniformly across the universe. This result has been well established using a combination of cosmological probes (e.g., Planck Collaboration et al. 2016), resulting in a "standard model" of modern cosmology that is a combination of a cosmological constant with cold dark matter and baryons. The first compelling evidence for this acceleration came in the late 1990's, when two independent teams studying type Ia supernovae discovered that distant SNe Ia were dimmer than expected. The combined analysis of modern cosmology experiments, including SNe Ia (Betoule et al. 2014), the cosmic microwave background (Planck Collaboration et al. 2016), and baryon acoustic oscillations (Alam et al. 2016), indicate {\~{}} 75 sigma evidence for positive Omega{\_}Lambda. A recent study has claimed that the evidence for acceleration from SNe Ia is marginal. Here we demonstrate errors in that analysis which reduce the significance from SNe Ia, and show that constraints on the flatness or matter density of the universe greatly increase the significance of acceleration. Analyzing the Joint Light-curve Analysis supernova sample, we find 4.2 sigma evidence for acceleration with SNe Ia alone, and 11.2 sigma in a flat universe. With the correct supernova analysis and by not rejecting all other cosmological constraints, we find that acceleration is quite secure.},

abstract = {We report Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) observations of four high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxy candidates selected from far-Infrared (FIR)/submm observations in the COSMOS field. We securely detect all galaxies in the continuum and spectroscopically confirm them at z=3.62--5.85 using ALMA 3mm line scans, detecting multiple CO and/or [CI] transitions. This includes the most distant dusty galaxy currently known in the COSMOS field, ID85001929 at z=5.847. These redshifts are lower than we had expected as these galaxies have substantially colder dust temperatures than most literature sources at z{\textgreater}4. We provide direct evidence that, given their cold spectral energy distributions, CMB plays a significant role biasing their observed Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) slopes to unlikely steep values and, possibly, reducing their CO fluxes by a factor of two. We recover standard RJ slopes when the CMB contribution is taken into account. High resolution ALMA imaging shows compact morphology and evidence for mergers. This work reveals a population of cold dusty star-forming galaxies that were under-represented in current surveys, and are even colder than typical Main Sequence galaxies at the same redshift. The observed cold dust temperatures could be a result of low star formation efficiency with rapid metal enrichment or, more likely, evidence for optically thick dust continuum in the FIR. High FIR dust optical depth might be a widespread feature of compact starbursts at any redshift.},

These are the deepest U-band images assembled to date over this large an area. These data are located in four fields also imaged to comparably faint levels in grizy and several narrowband filters as part of the Hyper Suprime–Cam (HSC) Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP). These CFHT and Subaru data sets will remain unmatched in their combination of area and depth until the advent of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. This paper provides an overview of the scientific motivation for CLAUDS and gives details of the observing strategy, observations, data reduction, and data merging with the HSC-SSP. Three early applications of these deep data are used to illustrate the potential of the data set: deep U-band galaxy number counts, z ∼ 3 Lyman break galaxy selection, and photometric redshifts improved by adding CLAUDS U to the Subaru HSC grizy photometry.},

abstract = {The properties of the dust grains (e.g., temperature and mass) can be derived from fitting far-IR SEDs ({\textgreater}100 micron). Only with SPIRE on Herschel has it been possible to get high spatial resolution at 200 to 500 micron that is beyond the peak ({\~{}}160 micron) of dust emission in most galaxies. We investigate the differences in the fitted dust temperatures and masses determined using only {\textless}200 micron data and then also including {\textgreater}200 micron data (new SPIRE observations) to determine how important having {\textgreater}200 micron data is for deriving these dust properties. We fit the 100 to 350 micron observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) point-by-point with a model that consists of a single temperature and fixed emissivity law. The data used are existing observations at 100 and 160 micron (from IRAS and Spitzer) and new SPIRE observations of 1/4 of the LMC observed for the HERITAGE Key Project as part of the Herschel Science Demonstration phase. The dust temperatures and masses computed using only 100 and 160 micron data can differ by up to 10{\%} and 36{\%}, respectively, from those that also include the SPIRE 250 {\&} 350 micron data. We find that an emissivity law proportional to lambda{\^{}}-1.5 minimizes the 100-350 micron fractional residuals. We find that the emission at 500 micron is {\~{}}10{\%} higher than expected from extrapolating the fits made at shorter wavelengths. We find the fractional 500 micron excess is weakly anti-correlated with MIPS 24 micron flux and the total gas surface density. This argues against a flux calibration error as the origin of the 500 micron excess. Our results do not allow us to distinguish between a systematic variation in the wavelength dependent emissivity law or a population of very cold dust only detectable at lambda {\textgreater} 500 micron for the origin of the 500 micron excess.},

abstract = {We utilize for the first time Hubble Space Telescope Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging to examine the structural properties of galaxies in the rest-frame U - V versus V - J diagram (i.e., the UVJ diagram) using a sample at 0.6 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.9 that reaches a low stellar mass limit (log M/M ⊙ {\textgreater}10.25). The use of the UVJ diagram as a tool to distinguish quiescent galaxies from star-forming galaxies (SFGs) is becoming more common due to its ability to separate red quiescent galaxies from reddened SFGs. Quiescent galaxies occupy a small and distinct region of UVJ color space and we find most of them to have concentrated profiles with high S{\'{e}}rsic indices (n {\textgreater} 2.5) and smooth structure characteristic of early-type systems. SFGs populate a broad but well-defined sequence of UVJ colors and are comprised of objects with a mix of S{\'{e}}rsic indices. Interestingly, most UVJ-selected SFGs with high S{\'{e}}rsic indices also display structure due to dust and star formation typical of the n {\textless} 2.5 SFGs and late-type systems. Finally, we find that the position of an SFG on the sequence of UVJ colors is determined to a large degree by the mass of the galaxy and its inclination. Systems that are closer to edge-on generally display redder colors and lower [O II]$\lambda$3727 luminosity per unit mass as a consequence of the reddening due to dust within the disks. We conclude that the two main features seen in UVJ color space correspond closely to the traditional morphological classes of early- and late-type galaxies.

However, no observations have yet been able to disentangle the physical driver. We analyze here a sample of 24 ETGs drawn from the CALIFA survey, deriving in a homogeneous way their stellar population and kinematic properties. We find that the local IMF is tightly related to the local metallicity, becoming more bottom-heavy toward metal-rich populations. Our result, combined with the galaxy mass-metallicity relation, naturally explains previous claims of a galaxy mass-IMF relation, derived from non-IFU spectra. If we assume that - within the star formation environment of ETGs - metallicity is the main driver of IMF variations, a significant revision of the interpretation of galaxy evolution observables is necessary.},

abstract = {Aims: The aim of this paper is twofold: i. investigate the properties of extragalactic dust and compare them to what is seen in the Galaxy; ii. address in an independent way the problem of the anomalous extinction curves reported for reddened Type Ia Supernovae (SN) in connection to the environments in which they explode. Methods: The properties of the dust are derived from the wavelength dependence of the continuum polarization observed in four reddened Type Ia SN: 1986G, 2006X, 2008fp and 2014J. [...] Results: All four objects are characterized by exceptionally low total-to-selective absorption ratios (R{\_}V) and display an anomalous interstellar polarization law, characterized by very blue polarization peaks. In all cases the polarization position angle is well aligned with the local spiral structure. While SN1986G is compatible with the most extreme cases of interstellar polarization known in the Galaxy, SN2006X, 2008fp and 2014J show unprecedented behaviors. The observed deviations do not appear to be connected to selection effects related to the relatively large amounts of reddening characterising the objects in the sample. Conclusion: The dust responsible for the polarization of these four SN is most likely of interstellar nature. The polarization properties can be interpreted in terms of a significantly enhanced abundance of small grains. The anomalous behavior is apparently associated with the properties of the galactic environment in which the SN explode, rather than with the progenitor system from which they originate. The question as to why lines-of-sight to Type Ia SN are so different from what is seen for stars in the Galaxy remains unanswered. Recent studies suggest that there is a link between the dust properties and the chemical/physical evolutionary stage of the host galaxy.},

SFR functions provide a more physical description of galaxy buildup at high redshift and allow for direct comparisons to SFRs at lower redshifts determined by a variety of techniques. Our SFR functions are derived from well-established z {\~{}} 4-7 UV LFs, UV-continuum slope trends with redshift and luminosity, and infrared excess (IRX)-beta relations. They are well described by Schechter relations. We extend the comparison baseline for SFR functions to z {\~{}} 2 by considering recent determinations of the Halpha and mid-IR LFs. The low-end slopes of the SFR functions are flatter than for the UV LFs, Deltaalpha {\~{}} +0.13, and show no clear evolution with cosmic time (z {\~{}} 0-7). In addition, we find that the characteristic value SFR* from the Schechter fit to the SFR function exhibits consistent, and substantial, linear growth as a function of redshift from {\~{}}5 M {\&}sun; yr-1 at z {\~{}} 8, 650 Myr after the big bang, to {\~{}}100 M {\&}sun; yr-1 at z {\~{}} 2, {\~{}}2.5 Gyr later. Recent results at z {\~{}} 10, close to the onset of galaxy formation, are consistent with this trend.

abstract = {Galaxy mergers are traditionally one of the favoured mechanisms for the transformation of spiral galaxies to spheroids and for quenching star formation. To test this paradigm in the context of modern cosmological simulations, we use the IllustrisTNG simulation to investigate the impact of individual merger events on quenching star formation (i.e. star formation rate at least 3$\sigma$ below the star-forming main sequence) within 500 Myr after the coalescence phase. The rate of quenching amongst recently merged galaxies is compared with a control sample that is matched in redshift, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), black hole mass and environment. We find quenching to be uncommon among the descendants of post-merger galaxies, with only {\$}\backslashsim 5{\{}{\{}\backslash \backslashrm per\backslash cent{\}}{\}}{\$} of galaxies quenching within 500 Myr after the merger. Despite this low absolute rate, we find that quenching occurs in post-mergers at twice the rate of the control galaxies. The fraction of quenched post-merger descendants 1.5 Gyr after the merger becomes statistically indistinguishable from that of non-post-mergers, suggesting that mergers could speed up the quenching process in those post-mergers whose progenitors had physical conditions able to sustain effective active galactic nuclei (AGN) kinetic feedback, thus capable of removing gas from galaxies. Our results indicate that although quenching does not commonly occur promptly after coalescence, mergers none the less do promote the cessation of star formation in some post-mergers. We find that, in IllustrisTNG, it is the implementation of the AGN kinetic feedback that is responsible for quenching post-mergers, as well as non-post-merger controls. As a result of the released kinetic energy, galaxies experience gas loss and eventually, they will quench. Galaxies with an initially low gas fraction show a preferable pre-disposition towards quenching. The primary distinguishing factor between quenched and star-forming galaxies is gas fraction, with a sharp boundary at fgas ∼ 0.1 in TNG.},

Based on the deep MUSE spectroscopy and ancillary Hubble Space Telescope (HST) photometry data, we carefully measured EW values taking into account extended Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emission and UV continuum slopes ({\$}\backslashbeta{\$}). Our LAEs reach unprecedented depths, both in Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} luminosities and UV absolute magnitudes, from log({\$}L{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Ly\backslashalpha{\}}{\$}/erg s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}) {\$}\backslashsim{\$}41.0 to 43.0 and from Muv {\$}\backslashsim{\$} -16 to -21 (0.01-1.0 {\$}L{\^{}}{\{}*{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm z=3{\}}{\$}). The EW values span the range of {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 5 to 240 $\backslash$AA$\backslash$ or larger, and their distribution can be well fitted by an exponential law {\$}N = N{\_}{\{}\backslashrm 0{\}}{\$} exp({\$}-{\$}EW/{\$}w{\_}{\{}\backslashrm 0{\}}{\$}). Owing to the high dynamic range in Muv, we find that the scale factor, {\$}w{\_}{\{}\backslashrm 0{\}}{\$}, depends on Muv in the sense that including fainter Muv objects increases {\$}w{\_}{\{}\backslashrm 0{\}}{\$}, i.e., the Ando effect. The results indicate that selection functions affect the EW scale factor. Taking these effects into account, we find that our {\$}w{\_}{\{}\backslashrm 0{\}}{\$} values are consistent with those in the literature within {\$}1\backslashsigma{\$} uncertainties at {\$}2.9 {\textless} z {\textless} 6.6{\$} at a given threshold of Muv and {\$}L{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Ly\backslashalpha{\}}{\$}.

Two of these 12 LAEs show signatures of merger or AGN activity: the weak CIV {\$}\backslashlambda 1549{\$} emission line. For the remaining 10 very large EW LAEs, we find that the EW values can be reproduced by young stellar ages ({\$}{\textless} 100{\$} Myr) and low metallicities ({\$}\backslashlesssim 0.02{\$} {\$}Z{\_}{\{}\backslashrm \backslashodot{\}}{\$}). Otherwise, at least part of the Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emission in these LAEs needs to arise from anisotropic radiative transfer effects, fluorescence by hidden AGN or quasi-stellar object activity, or gravitational cooling.},

The richest clusters have half of their total stellar mass bound to satellite galaxies, with the other half being associated with the central galaxy and the diffuse intra-cluster light. The exact ICL fraction depends sensitively on the definition of a central galaxy's mass and varies in our most massive clusters between 20 to 40{\%} of the total stellar mass. Haloes of {\$}5\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}14{\}}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm sun{\}}{\$} and above have more diffuse stellar mass outside 100 kpc than within 100 kpc, with power-law slopes of the radial mass density distribution as shallow as the dark matter's ( {\$}-3.5 {\textless} \backslashalpha{\_}{\{}\backslashrm 3D{\}} {\textless} -3{\$}). Total halo mass is a very good predictor of stellar mass, and vice versa: at {\$}z=0{\$}, the 3D stellar mass measured within 30 kpc scales as {\$}\backslashpropto (M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm 500c{\}}){\^{}}{\{}0.49{\}}{\$} with a {\$}\backslashsim 0.12{\$} dex scatter.

Even more fundamentally, halo mass alone is a good predictor for the whole stellar mass profiles beyond the inner few kpc, and we show how on average these can be precisely recovered given a single mass measurement of the galaxy or its halo.},

abstract = {A key obstacle to developing a satisfying theory of galaxy evolution is the difficulty in extending analytic descriptions of early structure formation into full non-linearity, the regime in which galaxy growth occurs. Extant techniques, though powerful, are based on approximate numerical methods whose Monte Carlo-like nature hinders intuition building. Here, we develop a new solution to this problem and its empirical validation. We first derive closed-form analytic expectations for the evolution of fixed percentiles in the real-space cosmic density distribution, averaged over representative volumes observers can track cross-sectionally. Using the Lagrangian forms of the fluid equations, we show that percentiles in $\delta$ - the density relative to the median - should grow as $\delta$(t) ∝ $\delta$0$\alpha$ t$\beta$, where $\alpha$ ≡ 2 and $\beta$ ≡ 2 for Newtonian gravity at epochs after the overdensities transitioned to non-linear growth. We then use 9.5 square degress of Carnegie-Spitzer-IMACS Redshift Survey data to map galaxy environmental densities over 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.5 (∼7 Gyr) and infer $\alpha$ = 1.98 ± 0.04 and $\beta$ = 2.01 ± 0.11 - consistent with our analytic prediction. These findings - enabled by swapping the Eulerian domain of most work on density growth for a Lagrangian approach to real-space volumetric averages - provide some of the strongest evidence that a lognormal distribution of early density fluctuations indeed decoupled from cosmic expansion to grow through gravitational accretion. They also comprise the first exact, analytic description of the non-linear growth of structure extensible to (arbitrarily) low redshift. We hope these results open the door to new modelling of, and insight-building into, galaxy growth and its diversity in cosmological contexts.},

abstract = {To investigate star formation and assembly processes of massive galaxies, we present here a spatially-resolved stellar populations analysis of a sample of 45 elliptical galaxies (Es) selected from the CALIFA survey. We find rather flat age and [Mg/Fe] radial gradients, weakly dependent on the effective velocity dispersion of the galaxy within half-light radius. However, our analysis shows that metallicity gradients become steeper with increasing galaxy velocity dispersion. In addition, we have homogeneously compared the stellar populations gradients of our sample of Es to a sample of nearby relic galaxies, i.e., local remnants of the high-z population of red nuggets. This comparison indicates that, first, the cores of present-day massive galaxies were likely formed in gas-rich, rapid star formation events at high redshift (z{\textgreater}2). This led to radial metallicity variations steeper than observed in the local Universe, and positive [Mg/Fe] gradients. Second, our analysis also suggests that a later sequence of minor dry mergers, populating the outskirts of early-type galaxies (ETGs), flattened the pristine [Mg/Fe] and metallicity gradients. Finally, we find a tight age-[Mg/Fe] relation, supporting that the duration of the star formation is the main driver of the [Mg/Fe] enhancement in massive ETGs. However, the star formation time-scale alone is not able to fully explain our [Mg/Fe] measurements. Interestingly, our results match the expected effect that a variable stellar initial mass function would have on the [Mg/Fe] ratio.},

We use a sample of BzK-selected star-forming galaxies, drawn from the COSMOS survey, to perform a stacking analysis of their 1.4 GHz radio continuum as a function of different stellar population properties, after removing AGN contaminants from the sample. Dust unbiased star formation rates are derived from radio fluxes assuming the local radio-IR correlation. The main results of this work are: i) specific star formation rates are constant over about 1 dex in stellar mass and up to the highest stellar mass probed; ii) the dust attenuation is a strong function of galaxy stellar mass with more massive galaxies being more obscured than lower mass objects; iii) a single value of the UV extinction applied to all galaxies would lead to grossly underestimate the SFR in massive galaxies; iv) correcting the observed UV luminosities for dust attenuation based on the Calzetti recipe provide results in very good agreement with the radio derived ones; v) the mean specific star formation rate of our sample steadily decreases by a factor of {\~{}}4 with decreasing redshift from z=2.3 to 1.4 and a factor of {\~{}}40 down the local Universe.   These empirical SFRs would cause galaxies to dramatically overgrow in mass if maintained all the way to low redshifts, we suggest that this does not happen because star formation is progressively quenched, likely starting from the most massive galaxies.},

abstract = {We have carried out a joint photometric and structural analysis of red sequence galaxies in four clusters at a mean redshift of z {\~{}} 1.25 using optical and near-IR HST imaging reaching to at least 3 magnitudes fainter than {\$}M{\^{}}*{\$}. As expected, the photometry and overall galaxy sizes imply purely passive evolution of stellar populations in red sequence cluster galaxies. However, the morphologies of red sequence cluster galaxies at these redshifts show significant differences to those of local counterparts. Apart from the most massive galaxies, the high redshift red sequence galaxies are significantly diskier than their low redshift analogues. These galaxies also show significant colour gradients, again not present in their low redshift equivalents, most straightforwardly explained by radial age gradients. A clear implication of these findings is that red sequence cluster galaxies originally arrive on the sequence as disk-dominated galaxies whose disks subsequently fade or evolve secularly to end up as high S$\backslash$'ersic index early-type galaxies (classical S0s or possibly ellipticals) at lower redshift. The apparent lack of growth seen in a comparison of high and low redshift red sequence galaxies implies that any evolution is internal and is unlikely to involve significant mergers. While significant star formation may have ended at high redshift, the cluster red sequence population continues to evolve (morphologically) for several Gyrs thereafter.},

abstract = {Post-starburst (E+A or k+a) spectra, characterized by their exceptionally strong Balmer lines in absorption and the lack of emission lines, belong to galaxies in which the star formation activity ended abruptly sometime during the past Gyr. We perform a spectral analysis of galaxies in clusters, groups, poor groups and the field at z=0.4-0.8 based on the ESO Distant Cluster Survey. The incidence of k+a's at these redshifts depends strongly on environment. K+a's reside preferentially in clusters and, unexpectedly, in a subset of the sigma = 200-400 km/s groups, those that have a low fraction of [OII] emitters. In these environments, 20-30{\%} of the recently star-forming galaxies have had their star formation activity recently truncated. In contrast, there are proportionally fewer k+a's in the field, the poor groups and groups with a high [OII] fraction. The incidence of k+a galaxies correlates with the cluster velocity dispersion: more massive clusters have higher proportions of k+a's. Spectra of dusty starburst candidates, with strong Balmer absorption and emission lines, present a very different environmental dependence from k+a's. They are numerous in all environments at z=0.4-0.8, but they are especially numerous in all types of groups, favoring the hypothesis of triggering by a merger. Our observations are consistent with previous suggestions that cluster k+a galaxies are observed in a transition phase as massive S0 and Sa galaxies, evolving from star-forming later types to passively evolving early-type galaxies. The correlation between k+a fraction and cluster sigma supports the hypothesis that k+a galaxies in clusters originate from processes related to the intracluster medium, while several possibilities are discussed for the origin of the k+a frequency in low-[OII] groups.(abr.)},

abstract = {In this paper, we present and analyse optical photometry and spectra of the extremely luminous and slowly evolving Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) 2009dc, and offer evidence that it is a super-Chandrasekhar mass (SC) SN Ia and thus had a SC white dwarf (WD) progenitor. Optical spectra of SN 2007if, a similar object, are also shown. SN 2009dc had one of the most slowly evolving light curves ever observed for a SN Ia, with a rise time of {\~{}}23 days and Delta m{\_}15(B) = 0.72 mag. We calculate a lower limit to the peak bolometric luminosity of {\~{}}2.4e43 erg/s, though the actual value is likely almost 40{\%} larger. Optical spectra of SN 2009dc and SN 2007if obtained near maximum brightness exhibit strong C II features (indicative of a significant amount of unburned material), and the post-maximum spectra are dominated by iron-group elements. All of our spectra of SN 2009dc and SN 2007if also show low expansion velocities. However, we see no strong evidence in SN 2009dc for a velocity "plateau" near maximum light like the one seen in SN 2007if (Scalzo et al. 2010). The high luminosity and low expansion velocities of SN 2009dc lead us to derive a possible WD progenitor mass of more than 2 M{\_}Sun and a Ni-56 mass of about 1.4-1.7 M{\_}Sun. We propose that the host galaxy of SN 2009dc underwent a gravitational interaction with a neighboring galaxy in the relatively recent past. This may have led to a sudden burst of star formation which could have produced the SC WD progenitor of SN 2009dc and likely turned the neighboring galaxy into a "post-starburst galaxy." No published model seems to match the extreme values observed in SN 2009dc, but simulations do show that such massive progenitors can exist (likely as a result of the merger of two WDs) and can possibly explode as SC SNe Ia.},

While the mass functions in the field and in its finer environments (groups, binary, and single systems) are well matched in the local universe down to the completeness limit of the observational sample, the model overpredicts the number of low-mass galaxies in the field at z ∼ 0.6 and in clusters at both redshifts. Above M * = 1010.25 M , it reproduces the observed similarity of the cluster and field mass functions but not the observed evolution. Our results point out two shortcomings of the model: an incorrect treatment of cluster-specific environmental effects and an overefficient galaxy formation at early times (as already found by, e.g., Weinmann et al.). Next, we consider only simulations. Also using the Guo et al. model, we find that the high-mass end of the mass functions depends on halo mass: only very massive halos host massive galaxies, with the result that their mass function is flatter. Above M * = 109.4 M , simulations show an evolution in the number of the most massive galaxies in all environments. Mass functions obtained from the two prescriptions are different, however, results are qualitatively similar, indicating that the adopted methods to model the evolution of central and satellite galaxies still have to be better implemented in semi-analytic models. {\textcopyright} 2014.

abstract = {We measure the dust and gas content of the three sub-millimeter galaxies (SMGs) in the GN20 proto-cluster at {\$}z=4.05{\$} using new IRAM Plateau de Bure interferometer (PdBI) CO(4-3) and 1.2-3.3 mm continuum observations. All these three SMGs are heavily dust obscured, with UV-based star formation rate (SFR) estimates significantly smaller than the ones derived from the bolometric infrared (IR), consistent with the spatial offsets revealed by HST and CO imaging. Based also on evaluations of the specific SFR, CO-to-H{\$}{\_}2{\$} conversion factor and gas depletion timescale, we classify all the three galaxies as starbursts (SBs), although with a lower confidence for GN20.2b that might be a later stage merging event. We place our measurements in the context of the evolutionary properties of main sequence (MS) and SB galaxies. ULIRGs have 3-5 times larger {\$}L'{\_}{\{}\backslashrm CO{\}}/M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm dust{\}}{\$} and {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm dust{\}}/M{\_}\backslashstar{\$} ratios than {\$}z=0{\$} MS galaxies, but by {\$}z\backslashsim2{\$} the difference appears to be blurred, probably due to differential metallicity evolution. SB galaxies appear to slowly evolve in their {\$}L'{\_}{\{}\backslashrm CO{\}}/M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm dust{\}}{\$} and {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm dust{\}}/M{\_}\backslashstar{\$} ratios all the way to {\$}z{\textgreater}6{\$} (consistent with rapid enrichment of SB events), while MS galaxies rapidly increase in {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm dust{\}}/M{\_}\backslashstar{\$} from {\$}z=0{\$} to 2 (due to gas fraction increase, compensated by a decrease of metallicities). While no IR/submm continuum detection is available for indisputably normal massive galaxies at {\$}z{\textgreater}2.5{\$}, we show that if metallicity indeed decrease rapidly for these systems at {\$}z{\textgreater}3{\$} as claimed in the literature, we should expect a strong decrease of their {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm dust{\}}/M{\_}\backslashstar{\$}, consistent with recent PdBI and ALMA upper limits. We conclude that the {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm dust{\}}/M{\_}\backslashstar{\$} ratio could be a powerful tool for distinguishing starbursts from normal galaxies at {\$}z{\textgreater}4{\$}.},

abstract = {Following our first detection reported in Izotov et al. (2016), we present the detection of Lyman continuum (LyC) radiation of four other compact star-forming galaxies observed with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS) onboard the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). These galaxies, at redshifts of z{\~{}}0.3, are characterized by high emission-line flux ratios [OIII]5007/[OII]3727 {\textgreater} 5. The escape fractions of the LyC radiation fesc(LyC) in these galaxies are in the range of {\~{}}6{\%}-13{\%}, the highest values found so far in low-redshift star-forming galaxies. Narrow double-peaked Lyalpha emission lines are detected in the spectra of all four galaxies, compatible with predictions for Lyman continuum leakers. We find escape fractions of Lyalpha, fesc(Lyalpha) {\~{}}20{\%}-40{\%}, among the highest known for Lyalpha emitters (LAEs). Surface brightness profiles produced from the COS acquisition images reveal bright star-forming regions in the center and exponential discs in the outskirts with disc scale lengths alpha in the range {\~{}}0.6-1.4 kpc. Our galaxies are characterized by low metallicity, {\~{}}1/8-1/5 solar, low stellar mass {\~{}}(0.2 - 4)e9 Msun, high star formation rates SFR{\~{}}14-36 Msun/yr, and high SFR densities Sigma{\~{}}2-35 Msun/yr/kpc{\^{}}2. These properties are comparable to those of high-redshift star-forming galaxies. Finally, our observations, combined with our first detection reported in Izotov et al. (2016), reveal that a selection for compact star-forming galaxies showing high [OIII]5007/[OII]3727 ratios appears to pick up very efficiently sources with escaping Lyman continuum radiation: all five of our selected galaxies are LyC leakers.},

abstract = {We propose a method to substantially increase the flexibility and power of template fitting-based photometric redshifts by transforming a large numbers of galaxy spectral templates into a corrresponding collection of "fuzzy archetypes" using a suitable set of perturbative priors designed to account for empirical variation in dust attenuation and emission line strengths. To bypass widely seperated degeneracies in parameter space (e.g., the redshift-reddening degeneracy), we train Self-Organizing Maps (SOMs) on a large "model catalogs" generated from appropriate Monte Carlo sampling of our fuzzy archetypes to cluster the predicted observables in a topologically smooth fashion. Subsequent sampling over the SOM then allows full reconstruction of the relevant probability distribution functions (PDFs) using the associated set of inverse mappings from the SOM to the underlying model parameters. This combined approach enables the multi-modal exploration of known variation among galaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using large numbers of archetypes with minimal modeling assumptions. We demonstrate the power of this approach to recover full redshift PDFs using discrete Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods combined with SOMs constructed from model catalogs based on LSST {\$}ugrizY{\$} and Euclid {\$}YJH{\$} mock photometry.},

abstract = {We study the origin and cosmic evolution of the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) in star-forming galaxies based on a full, numerical chemical evolution model. The model was designed to match the local MZRs for both gas and stars simultaneously. This is achieved by invoking a time-dependent metal enrichment process which assumes either a time-dependent metal outflow with larger metal loading factors in galactic winds at early times, or a time-dependent Initial Mass Function (IMF) with steeper slopes at early times. We compare the predictions from this model with data sets covering redshifts 0{\textless}z{\textless}3.5. The data suggests a two-phase evolution with a transition point around z {\~{}} 1.5. Before that epoch the MZRgas has been evolving parallel with no evolution in the slope. After z {\~{}} 1.5 the MZRgas started flattening until today. We show that the predictions of both the variable metal outflow and the variable IMF model match these observations very well. Our model also reproduces the evolution of the main sequence, hence the correlation between galaxy mass and star formation rate. We also compare the predicted redshift evolution of the MZRstar with data from the literature. As the latter mostly contains data of massive, quenched early-type galaxies, stellar metallicities at high redshifts tend to be higher in the data than predicted by our model. Data of stellar metallicities of lower-mass ({\textless} 10{\^{}}11 solar mass), star-forming galaxies at high redshift is required to test our model.},

abstract = {We examine the cosmic evolution of a stellar initial mass function (IMF) in galaxies that varies with the Jeans mass in the interstellar medium, paying particular attention to the K-band stellar mass-to-light ratio (M/LK) of present-epoch massive galaxies. We calculate the typical Jeans mass using high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations coupled with a fully radiative model for the interstellar medium (ISM), which yields a parametrization of the IMF characteristic mass as a function of galaxy star formation rate (SFR).We then calculate the star formation histories of galaxies utilizing an equilibrium galaxy growth model coupled with constraints on the star formation histories set by abundance matching models. We find that at early times, energetic coupling between dust and gas drives warm conditions in the ISM, yielding bottom-light/topheavy IMFs associated with large ISM Jeans masses for massive star-forming galaxies. Owing to the remnants of massive stars that formed during the top-heavy phases at early times, the resultant M/LK($\sigma$) in massive galaxies at the present epoch is increased relative to the nonvarying IMF case. At late times, lower cosmic ray fluxes allow for cooler ISM temperatures in massive galaxies, and hence newly formed clusters will exhibit bottom-heavy IMFs, further increasing M/LK($\sigma$). Our central result is hence that a given massive galaxy may go through both top-heavy and bottom-heavy IMF phases during its lifetime, though the bulk of the stars form during a top-heavy phase. Qualitatively, the variations in M/LK($\sigma$) with galaxy mass are in agreement with observations; however, our model may not be able to account for bottom-heavy mass functions as indicated by stellar absorption features. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

We find that, on average, galaxy half-light radii are {\$}\backslashsim8{\$}$\backslash${\%} smaller at 4.4{\$}\backslashmu{\$}m than 1.5{\$}\backslashmu{\$}m in this sample. This size difference is markedly stronger at higher stellar masses and redder rest-frame {\$}V-J{\$} colors: galaxies with {\$}{\{}\backslashrm M{\}}{\_}* \backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}\backslash,{\{}\backslashrm M{\}}{\_}\backslashodot{\$} have 4.4{\$}\backslashmu{\$}m sizes that are {\$}\backslashsim 25{\$}$\backslash$,$\backslash${\%} smaller than their 1.5{\$}\backslashmu{\$}m sizes. Our results indicate that galaxy mass profiles are significantly more compact than their rest-frame optical light profiles at cosmic noon, and demonstrate that spatial variations in age and attenuation are important, particularly for massive galaxies. The trend that we find here impacts our understanding of the size growth and evolution of galaxies, and suggests that previous studies based on rest-frame optical light may not have captured the mass-weighted structural evolution of galaxies. This paper represents a first step towards a new understanding of the morphologies of early massive galaxies enabled by JWST's infrared window into the distant universe.},

A spectrum at 5 days past B-band maximum light is a direct match to the super-Chandrasekhar-mass candidate SN Ia 2003fg, showing Si II and C II at {\~{}}9000 km/s. A high signal-to-noise co-addition of the SN spectral time series reveals no Na I D absorption, suggesting negligible reddening in the host galaxy, and the late-time color evolution has the same slope as the Lira relation for normal SNe Ia. The ejecta appear to be well mixed, with no strong maximum in I-band and a diversity of iron-peak lines appearing in near-maximum-light spectra. SN2007 if also displays a plateau in the Si II velocity extending as late as +10 days, which we interpret as evidence for an overdense shell in the SN ejecta. We calculate the bolometric light curve of the SN and use it and the $\backslash$ion{\{}Si{\}}{\{}2{\}} velocity evolution to constrain the mass of the shell and the underlying SN ejecta, and demonstrate that SN2007 if is strongly inconsistent with a Chandrasekhar-mass scenario. Within the context of a "tamped detonation" model appropriate for double-degenerate mergers, and assuming no host extinction, we estimate the total mass of the system to be 2.4 +/- 0.2 solar masses, with 1.6 +/- 0.1 solar masses of nickel-56 and with 0.3-0.5 solar masses in the form of an envelope of unburned carbon/oxygen. Our modeling demonstrates that the kinematics of shell entrainment provide a more efficient mechanism than incomplete nuclear burning for producing the low velocities typical of super-Chandrasekhar-mass SNeIa.},

abstract = {We refine a technique to measure the absorption corrected ultraviolet (UV) luminosity of starburst galaxies using rest frame UV quantities alone, and apply it to U-dropouts at z {\~{}} 3 found in the Hubble Deep Field. The method is based on an observed correlation between the ratio of far infrared (FIR) to UV fluxes with spectral slope $\backslash$beta (a UV color). A simple fit to this relation allows the UV flux absorbed by dust to be calculated, and hence the dust-free UV luminosity to be determined. IUE spectra and IRAS fluxes of local starbursts are used to calibrate the ratio in terms of 1600 Angstrom absorption A{\_}{\{}1600{\}}, and the transformation from broad band color to $\backslash$beta. We show that the recent marginal and non-detections of HDF U-dropouts in the radio and sub-mm are consistent with our calculated A{\_}{\{}1600{\}}. This is also true of observations of the ratio of optical emission line flux to UV flux density in the brightest U-dropouts. This latter ratio turns out not to be a good indicator of dust extinction.

abstract = {We present 65 extremely dust-obscured galaxies from the UltraVISTA DR3 survey of the COSMOS field at {\$}1{\textless}z{\textless}4{\$}. In contrast to other studies of dusty galaxies, we select our sample based on dust attenuation measured by UV-MIR spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling that allows for extreme attenuation levels. We construct our sample by making cuts at {\$}1 \backslashle z \backslashle 4{\$}, A{\$}{\_}V \backslashge 3{\$}, and log(M{\$}{\_}*{\$}/M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}){\$} \backslashge 10.5{\$}. This method reliably selects galaxies exhibiting independent indicators of significant dust content, including FIR detection rates. We perform panchromatic SED modeling with matched {\$}Herschel{\$} photometry and find stellar and dust properties that differ from typical sub-millimeter galaxy (SMG) samples as well as {\$}Herschel{\$} sources matched in redshift and stellar mass. Our sources have lower star formation rates and higher A{\$}{\_}V{\$} than SMGs, but comparable total IR luminosities. Most of our sample falls on or near the star-forming main sequence for this redshift range. Finally, we perform a morphological analysis with GALFIT using the {\$}K{\_}S{\$}-band images and {\$}Hubble{\$} {\$}F814W{\$} and {\$}F160W{\$} imaging when available. Typical axis ratios of {\$}\backslashsim 0.4{\$} suggest disk-like morphology for the majority of our sources, and we note only three apparent merging systems. Our sample generally agrees with the size-mass relation for star-forming galaxies, with a tail extending to smaller sizes. We conclude that the most heavily obscured galaxies in this redshift range share many characteristics with typical star-forming galaxies, forming a population of dusty galaxies that overlaps, but is not encompassed by, those selected through dust emission.},

Moreover, we find larger {\$}D{\_}n4000{\$} values in denser environments at fixed stellar mass, suggesting that galaxies are on average older and/or more metal-rich in such dense environments. This set of tracers depicts a scenario where the most massive galaxies have, on average, the lowest sSFRs and the oldest stellar populations (age {\$}\backslashgtrsim1{\$} Gyr, showing a mass-downsizing effect). We also hypothesize that the observed increase in star formation (higher EW{\$}{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}[OII]|{\}}{\$}, higher sSFR) at intermediate densities may lead to quenching since we find the quenched fraction to increase sharply from the filament to cluster-like regions at similar stellar masses.},

The light curves and spectra closely resemble those of the prototypical SN 1992A, and the luminosity at maximum (M{\_}B = -19.08) is close to the average for a SN Ia. However, the ejected 56Ni mass derived by modelling the bolometric light curve (about 0.45 solar masses) lies near the lower limit of the 56Ni mass distribution observed in normal SNe Ia. Accordingly, SN 2004eo shows a relatively rapid post-maximum decline in the light curve (Delta m{\_}(B) = 1.46), small expansion velocities in the ejecta, and a depth ratio Si II 5972 / Si II 6355 similar to that of SN 1992A. The physical properties of SN 2004eo cause it to fall very close to the boundary between the faint, low velocity gradient, and high velocity gradient subgroups proposed by Benetti et al. (2005). Similar behaviour is seen in a few other SNe Ia. Thus, there may in fact exist a few SNe Ia with intermediate physical properties.},

abstract = {The Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) allows for the first time a highly significant census of environments and structures up to redshift one, as well as a full morphological description of the galaxy population. In this paper we present a study aimed to constrain the evolution, in the redshift range 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.2, of the mass content of different morphological types and its dependence on the environmental density. We use a deep multicolor catalog, covering an area of {\~{}}0.7 square degrees inside the COSMOS field, with accurate photometric redshifts (i {\textless} 26.5 and dz/(z+1) {\~{}} 0.035). We estimate galaxy stellar masses by fitting the multi-color photometry to a grid of composite stellar population models. We quantitatively describe the galaxy morphology by fitting PSF convolved Sersic profiles to the galaxy surface brightness distributions down to F814 = 24 mag for a sample of 41300 objects.   We confirm an evolution of the morphological mix with redshift: the higher the redshift the more disk-dominated galaxies become important. We find that the morphological mix is a function of the local comoving density: the morphology density relation extends up to the highest redshift explored.   The stellar mass function of disk-dominated galaxies is consistent with being constant with redshift. Conversely, the stellar mass function of bulge-dominated systems shows a decline in normalization with redshift. Such different behaviors of late-types and early-types stellar mass functions naturally set the redshift evolution of the transition mass. ABRIDGED},

The trend of increasing {\$}W{\$} with decreasing stellar mass is strongest for [OIII] (and [OIII]+H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$}). More generally, the equivalent widths of all the lines increase with redshift at a fixed stellar mass or fixed gas-phase metallicity, suggesting that high equivalent width galaxies are common at high redshift. This redshift evolution in equivalent widths can be explained by the increase in SFR and decrease in metallicity with redshift at a fixed stellar mass. Consequently, the dependence of {\$}W{\$} on sSFR is largely invariant with redshift, particularly when examined for galaxies of a given metallicity. Our results show that high equivalent width galaxies, specifically those with high {\$}W({\{}\backslashrm [OIII]{\}}){\$}, have low stellar masses, blue UV slopes, young ages, high sSFRs, ISM line ratios indicative of high ionization parameters, high {\$}\backslashxi{\_}{\{}\backslashrm ion{\}}{\$}, and low metallicities.

abstract = {We explore the structures of protoclusters and their relationship with high-redshift clusters using the Millennium Simulation combined with a semi-analytic model. We find that protoclusters are very extended, with 90 per cent of their mass spread across {\~{}}35 h-1 Mpc comoving at z = 2 ({\~{}}30 arcmin). The 'main halo', which can manifest as a high-redshift cluster or group, is only a minor feature of the protocluster, containing less than 20 per cent of all protocluster galaxies at z = 2. Furthermore, many protoclusters do not contain a main halo that is massive enough to be identified as a high-redshift cluster. Protoclusters exist in a range of evolutionary states at high redshift, independent of the mass they will evolve to at z = 0. We show that the evolutionary state of a protocluster can be approximated by the mass ratio of the first and second most massive haloes within the protocluster, and the z = 0 mass of a protocluster can be estimated to within 0.2 dex accuracy if both the mass of the main halo and the evolutionary state are known. We also investigate the biases introduced by only observing star-forming protocluster members within small fields. The star formation rate required for line-emitting galaxies to be detected is typically high, which leads to the artificial loss of low-mass galaxies from the protocluster sample. This effect is stronger for observations of the centre of the protocluster, where the quenched galaxy fraction is higher. This loss of low-mass galaxies, relative to the field, distorts the size of the galaxy overdensity, which in turn can contribute to errors in predicting the z = 0 evolved mass.},

abstract = {We introduce the Virgo Consortium's Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments (EAGLE) project, a suite of hydrodynamical simulations that follow the formation of galaxies and supermassive black holes in cosmologically representative volumes of a standard $\Lambda$ cold dark matter universe. We discuss the limitations of such simulations in light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) in which thermal energy is injected into the gas without the need to turn off cooling or decouple hydrodynamical forces, allowing winds to develop without predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because the feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles, we calibrate them to the present-day galaxy stellar mass function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed galaxy stellar mass function is reproduced to ≲0.2 dex over the full resolved mass range, 108 {\textless} M*/M⊙ ≲ 1011, a level of agreement close to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a representative set of low-redshift observables not considered in the calibration, and find good agreement with the observed galaxy specific star formation rates, passive fractions, Tully-Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy clusters, and column density distributions of intergalactic C IV and O VI. While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are consistent with observations for M* ≳ 109 M⊙ (M* ≳ 1010 M⊙ at intermediate resolution), they are insufficiently steep at lower masses. For the reference model, the gas fractions and temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for galaxy groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN feedback. The EAGLE simulation suite, which also includes physics variations and higher resolution zoomed-in volumes described elsewhere, constitutes a valuable new resource for studies of galaxy formation.},

abstract = {We report the detection of ADFS-27, a dusty, starbursting major merger at a redshift of z=5.655, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). ADFS-27 was selected from Herschel/SPIRE and APEX/LABOCA data as an extremely red "870 micron riser" (i.e., S{\_}250{\textless}S{\_}350{\textless}S{\_}500{\textless}S{\_}870), demonstrating the utility of this technique to identify some of the highest-redshift dusty galaxies. A scan of the 3mm atmospheric window with ALMA yields detections of CO(5-4) and CO(6-5) emission, and a tentative detection of H2O(211-202) emission, which provides an unambiguous redshift measurement. The strength of the CO lines implies a large molecular gas reservoir with a mass of M{\_}gas=2.5x10{\^{}}11(alpha{\_}CO/0.8)(0.39/r{\_}51) Msun, sufficient to maintain its {\~{}}2400 Msun/yr starburst for at least {\~{}}100 Myr. The 870 micron dust continuum emission is resolved into two components, 1.8 and 2.1 kpc in diameter, separated by 9.0 kpc, with comparable dust luminosities, suggesting an ongoing major merger. The infrared luminosity of L{\_}IR{\~{}}=2.4x10{\^{}}13Lsun implies that this system represents a binary hyper-luminous infrared galaxy, the most distant of its kind presently known. This also implies star formation rate surface densities of Sigma{\_}SFR=730 and 750Msun/yr/kpc2, consistent with a binary "maximum starburst". The discovery of this rare system is consistent with a significantly higher space density than previously thought for the most luminous dusty starbursts within the first billion years of cosmic time, easing tensions regarding the space densities of z{\~{}}6 quasars and massive quiescent galaxies at z{\textgreater}{\~{}}3.},

We have developed, implemented, and tested a new method of estimating stellar mass-to-light ratios, which relies on redshift and spectral energy distribution (SED) classification from 5 broadband and 12 medium band filters. We find that the majority ({\textgreater}60{\%}) of massive galaxies with M* {\textgreater} 1011 M⊙ at all z {\textless} 1 are non-star-forming; blue star-forming galaxies dominate at lower masses. We have used these mass estimates to explore the evolution of the stellar mass function since z = 1. We find that the total stellar mass density of the universe has roughly doubled since z - 1. Our measurements are consistent with other measurements of the growth of stellar mass with cosmic time and with estimates of the time evolution of the cosmic star formation rate. Intriguingly, the integrated stellar mass of blue galaxies with young stars has not significantly changed since z ∼ 1, even though these galaxies host the majority of the star formation: instead, the growth of the total stellar mass density is dominated by the growth of the total mass in the largely passive galaxies on the red sequence. {\textcopyright} ESO 2006.},

abstract = {We study the ionization structure of galactic outflows in 37 nearby, star forming galaxies with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. We use the O I, Si II, Si III, and Si IV ultraviolet absorption lines to characterize the different ionization states of outflowing gas. We measure the equivalent widths, line widths, and outflow velocities of the four transitions, and find shallow scaling relations between them and galactic stellar mass and star formation rate. Regardless of the ionization potential, lines of similar strength have similar velocities and line widths, indicating that the four transitions can be modeled as a co-moving phase. The Si equivalent width ratios (e.g. Si IV/Si II) have low dispersion, and little variation with stellar mass; while ratios with O I and Si vary by a factor of 2 for a given stellar mass. Photo-ionization models reproduce these equivalent width ratios, while shock models under predict the relative amount of high ionization gas. The photo-ionization models constrain the ionization parameter (U) between -2.25 {\textless} log(U) {\textless} -1.5, and require that the outflow metallicities are greater than 0.5 Z{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. We derive ionization fractions for the transitions, and show that the range of ionization parameters and stellar metallicities leads to a factor of 1.15-10 variation in the ionization fractions. Historically, mass outflow rates are calculated by converting a column density measurement from a single metal ion into a total Hydrogen column density using an ionization fraction, thus mass outflow rates are sensitive to the assumed ionization structure of the outflow.},

abstract = {We present the first spatially-resolved observations of molecular gas in a sample of cluster galaxies beyond z{\textgreater}0.1. Using ALMA, we detect CO (2-1) in 8 z{\~{}}1.6 cluster galaxies, all within a single 70" primary beam, in under 3 hours of integration time. The cluster, SpARCS-J0225, is replete with gas-rich galaxies in close proximity. It thus affords an efficient multiplexing strategy to build up the first sample of resolved CO in distant galaxy clusters. Mapping out the kinematic structure and morphology of the molecular gas on 3.5 kpc scales reveals rotating gas disks in the majority of the galaxies, as evidenced by smooth velocity gradients. Detailed velocity maps also uncover kinematic peculiarities, including a central gas void, a merger, and a few one-sided gas tails. We compare the extent of the molecular gas component to that of the optical stellar component, measured with rest-frame optical HST imaging. We find that the cluster galaxies, while broadly consistent with a ratio of unity for stellar-to-gas effective radii, have a moderately larger ratio compared to the coeval field; this is consistent with the more pronounced trend in the low-redshift Universe. Thus, at first glance, the z{\~{}}1.6 cluster galaxies generally look like galaxies infalling from the field, with typical main-sequence star formation rates and massive molecular gas reservoirs situated in rotating disks. However, there are potentially important differences from their field counterparts, including elevated gas fractions, slightly smaller CO disks, and possible asymmetric gas tails. Taken in tandem, these signatures are tentative evidence for gas-stripping in the z{\~{}}1.6 cluster. However, the current sample size of spatially-resolved molecular gas in galaxies at high redshift is small, and verification of these trends will require much larger samples of both cluster and field galaxies.},

abstract = {We present a comparative analysis of the properties of passive, star-forming and transition (green valley) galaxies, in four discrete environments: field, groups, the outskirts and the core of X-ray clusters. We construct samples of galaxies from the SDSS in these environments so that they are bound to have similar redshift distributions. The classification of galaxies into the three sequences is based on the UV-optical colour NUV−r. We study a number of galaxy prop-erties: stellar mass, morphology, specific star formation rate and the history of star formation. The analysis of green valley galaxies reveals that the physical mechanisms responsible for external quenching become more efficient moving from the field to denser environments. We confirm previous findings that green valley galaxies have intermediate morphologies, more-over, we find that this appears to be independent of the environment. Regarding the stellar mass of green valley galaxies, we find that they tend to be more massive in the field than in denser environments. On average, green valley galaxies account for ∼ 20{\%} of all galax-ies in groups and X-ray clusters. We find evidence that the field environment is inefficient in transforming low mass galaxies. Green valley galaxies have average star formation histo-ries intermediate between passive and star forming galaxies, and have a clear and consistent dependence on the environment: both, the quenching time, and the amplitude of the star for-mation rate, decrease towards higher density environments.},

We explore TNG100, a rerun of the original Illustris box, and TNG300, which includes 2x2500{\^{}}3 resolution elements in a volume twenty times larger. Here we present first results on the galaxy color bimodality at low redshift. Accounting for the attenuation of stellar light by dust, we compare the simulated (g-r) colors of 10{\^{}}9 {\textless} M*/Msun {\textless} 10{\^{}}12.5 galaxies to the observed distribution from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find a striking improvement with respect to the original Illustris simulation, as well as excellent quantitative agreement in comparison to the observations, with a sharp transition in median color from blue to red at a characteristic M* {\~{}} 10{\^{}}10.5 Msun. Investigating the build-up of the color-mass plane and the formation of the red sequence, we demonstrate that the primary driver of galaxy color transition in the TNG model is supermassive blackhole feedback in its low-accretion state. Across the entire population we measure a median color transition timescale dt{\_}green of {\~{}}1.6 Gyr, a value which drops for increasingly massive galaxies. We find signatures of the physical process of quenching: at fixed stellar mass, redder galaxies have lower SFRs, gas fractions, and gas metallicities; their stellar populations are also older and their large-scale interstellar magnetic fields weaker than in bluer galaxies. Finally, we measure the amount of stellar mass growth on the red sequence. Galaxies with M* {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}11 Msun which redden at z{\textless}1 accumulate on average {\~{}}25{\%} of their final z=0 mass post-reddening; at the same time, {\~{}}18{\%} of such massive galaxies acquire half or more of their final stellar mass while on the red sequence.},

abstract = {We present the GALEX far FUV and near NUV ultraviolet imaging of three nearby shell galaxies, namely NGC 2865, NGC 5018 and NGC 7135. The system of shells and fine structures visible in the optical is detected in the NUV image of NGC 2865 and in both NUV and FUV images of NGC 7135. The NUV image of NGC 5018 does not present shell structures. We detect absorption features in the nuclear region of all three galaxies. NGC 2865 has a nearly flat colour profile with (FUV-NUV){\~{}}2 throughout the whole galaxy. NGC 7135 is blue in the center (FUV-NUV){\~{}}0 and as red as (FUV-NUV){\~{}}1.5 in the outskirts, including the faint shell-like feature. We investigate the ability of the nuclear GALEX (FUV-NUV) colour to provide information about rejuvenation phenomena in the stellar populations of the shell galaxies. To this aim, we derive from theory the relationship between the Mg2, Hbeta, HgammaA, HdeltaA Lick line-strength indices and the (FUV-NUV) colour. We extend the study to a sample of early-type galaxies with emission lines in their optical spectra (Annibali et al. 2007). In the index vs.(FUV-NUV) colour diagrams, most of the galaxies are well explained by passively evolving SSPs. On the average, ages and metallicities of the galaxies in our sample estimated from optical line-strength indices are consistent with those inferred from the (FUV-NUV) colour. In general, all the colours but for (FUV-NUV) and (FUV-V), become nearly age insensitive when 1-2 Gyr have elapsed from the last star forming event. Considering composite stellar population models with a recent burst of star formation, we suggest that the position of the NGC 7135 and NGC 2865 nuclei in the (FUV-NUV)-Hbeta plane could be explained in term of a recent rejuvenation episode.

abstract = {The relation between the ratio of infrared (IR) and ultraviolet (UV) flux densities (the infrared excess: IRX) and the slope of the UV spectrum ($\backslash$beta) of galaxies plays a fundamental role in the evaluation of the dust attenuation of star forming galaxies especially at high redshifts. Many authors, however, pointed out that there is a significant dispersion and/or deviation from the originally proposed IRX-$\backslash$beta relation depending on sample selection. We reexamined the IRX-$\backslash$beta relation by measuring the far- and near-UV flux densities of the original sample galaxies with GALEX and AKARI imaging data, and constructed a revised formula. We found that the newly obtained IRX values were lower than the original relation because of the significant underestimation of the UV flux densities of the galaxies, caused by the small aperture of IUE, Further, since the original relation was based on IRAS data which covered a wavelength range of $\backslash$lambda = 42--122$\backslash$mum, using the data from AKARI which has wider wavelength coverage toward longer wavelengths, we obtained an appropriate IRX-$\backslash$beta relation with total dust emission (TIR): $\backslash$log(L{\_}{\{}$\backslash$rm TIR{\}}/L{\_}{\{}$\backslash$rm FUV{\}}) = $\backslash$log [10{\^{}}{\{}0.4(3.06+1.58$\backslash$beta){\}}-1] +0.22. This new relation is consistent with most of the preceding results for samples selected at optical and UV, though there is a significant scatter around it. We also found that even the quiescent class of IR galaxies follows this new relation, though luminous and ultraluminous IR galaxies distribute completely differently as well known before.},

abstract = {The birth of stars and the formation of galaxies are cornerstones of modern astrophysics. While much is known about how galaxies globally and their stars individually form and evolve, one fundamental property that affects both remains elusive. This is problematic because this key property, the birth mass distribution of stars, referred to as the stellar initial mass function, is a key tracer of the physics of star formation that underpins almost all of the unknowns in galaxy and stellar evolution. It is perhaps the greatest source of systematic uncertainty in star and galaxy evolution. The past decade has seen a growing variety of methods for measuring or inferring the initial mass function. This range of approaches and evolving definitions of the quantity being measured has in turn led to conflicting conclusions regarding whether or not the initial mass function is universal. Here I review this growing wealth of approaches, and highlight the importance of considering potential initial mass function variations, reinforcing the need to carefully quantify the scope and uncertainties of measurements. I present a new framework to aid the discussion of the initial mass function and promote clarity in the further development of this fundamental field.},

abstract = {We present a series of high-resolution cosmological simulations1 of galaxy formation to z = 0, spanning halo masses {\~{}}108-1013M, and stellar masses {\~{}}104-1011M. Our simulations include fully explicit treatment of themultiphase interstellarmedium and stellar feedback. The stellar feedback inputs (energy, momentum, mass, and metal fluxes) are taken directly from stellar population models. These sources of feedback, with zero adjusted parameters, reproduce the observed relation between stellar and halo mass up to Mhalo {\~{}} 1012M. We predict weak redshift evolution in the M*-Mhalo relation, consistent with current constraints to z {\textgreater} 6. We find that the M*-Mhalo relation is insensitive to numerical details, but is sensitive to feedback physics. Simulations with only supernova feedback fail to reproduce observed stellar masses, particularly in dwarf and high-redshift galaxies: radiative feedback (photoheating and radiation pressure) is necessary to destroy giant molecular clouds and enable efficient coupling of later supernovae to the gas. Star formation rates (SFRs) agree well with the observed Kennicutt relation at all redshifts. The galaxy-averaged Kennicutt relation is very different from the numerically imposed law for converting gas into stars, and is determined by self-regulation via stellar feedback. Feedback reduces SFRs and produces reservoirs of gas that lead to rising latetime star formation histories, significantly different from halo accretion histories. Feedback also produces large short-time-scale variability in galactic SFRs, especially in dwarfs. These properties are not captured by common 'sub-grid' wind models.},

abstract = {About 35 years ago a class of galaxies with unusually strong Balmer absorption lines and weak emission lines was discovered in distant galaxy clusters. These objects, alternatively referred to as post-starburst, E+A or k+a galaxies, are now known to occur in all environments and at all redshifts, with many exhibiting compact morphologies and low-surface brightness features indicative of past galaxy mergers. They are commonly thought to represent galaxies that are transitioning from blue to red sequence, making them critical to our understanding of the origins of galaxy bimodality. However, recent observational studies have questioned this simple interpretation. From observations alone, it is challenging to disentangle the different mechanisms that lead to the quenching of star formation in galaxies. Here we present examples of three different evolutionary pathways that lead to galaxies with strong Balmer absorption lines in the EAGLE simulation: classical blue-to-red quenching, blue-to-blue cycle and red-to-red rejuvenation. The first two are found in both post-starburst galaxies and galaxies with truncated star formation. Each pathway is consistent with scenarios hypothesised for observational samples. The fact that 'post-starburst' signatures can be attained via various evolutionary channels explains the diversity of observed properties, and lends support to the idea that slower quenching channels are important at low redshift.},

abstract = {We study the expansion of the nearby Universe using a sample of Type Ia supernovae at redshifts below 0.08. These supernovae allow peculiar velocities to be measured at unprecedented precision. We have investigated in detail the possibility of a varying Hubble constant with redshift and found no evidence of a monopole term for the nearby Universe. A large scale streaming motion is found at an amplitude of about {\$}340{\^{}}{\{}63{\}}{\_}{\{}-71{\}}{\$} km/sec, aligned in the direction of {\$}(l{\_}0, b{\_}0) = (312{\^{}}{\{}\backslashrm o{\}}.0{\^{}}{\{}13.5{\}}{\_}{\{}-7.4{\}}, 25{\^{}}{\{}\backslashrm o{\}}.7{\^{}}{\{}8.0{\}}{\_}{\{}-9.2{\}}){\$}, which is close to the direction of the center of Shapley supercluster of galaxies. The large scale streaming motion is best fit by a function involving a strong bipolar term. The streaming velocity field extends from the lowest redshift ({\$}\backslashsim 0.007{\$}) to beyond 0.025 and likely out to even higher redshifts. The velocity field at redshift below 0.01 can be equally well described by a dipole field or by the same bipolar streaming velocity field that reaches out to beyond {\$}z \backslashsim 0.025{\$}. We are also able to deduce a robust estimate of the random velocity component of the peculiar velocity field. Within the volume of redshift below 0.01 (weighted average redshift of {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 0.067), this thermal component is found to be about 270 km/sec. After correcting this smooth streaming motion, we are able to significantly improve the Hubble expansion fits of these supernovae. The CMAGIC method gives a dramatic decrease of {\$}\backslashchi{\^{}}2{\$} from 90 to 63 for 69 degrees of freedom, and yields a residual scatter of only 0.12 magnitude; the maximum light method gives also a moderate improvement.},

We extract a large sample of early-type galaxies ($\backslash$sim11000) from several spectroscopic surveys, spanning almost 8 billion years of cosmic lookback time (0.15 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.42). We select the most massive, red elliptical galaxies, passively evolving and without signature of ongoing star formation. Those galaxies can be used as standard cosmic chronometers, as firstly proposed by Jimenez {\&} Loeb (2002), whose differential age evolution as a function of cosmic time directly probes H(z). We analyze the 4000 {\{}$\backslash$AA{\}} break (D4000) as a function of redshift, use stellar population synthesis models to theoretically calibrate the dependence of the differential age evolution on the differential D4000, and estimate the Hubble parameter taking into account both statistical and systematical errors. We provide 8 new measurements of H(z) (see Tab. 4), and determine its change in H(z) to a precision of 5-12{\%} mapping homogeneously the redshift range up to z $\backslash$sim 1.1; for the first time, we place a constraint on H(z) at z $\backslash$neq 0 with a precision comparable with the one achieved for the Hubble constant (about 5-6{\%} at z $\backslash$sim 0.2), and covered a redshift range (0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.8) which is crucial to distinguish many different quintessence cosmologies. These measurements have been tested to best match a $\backslash$Lambda CDM model, clearly providing a statistically robust indication that the Universe is undergoing an accelerated expansion.

abstract = {To understand cosmic mass assembly in the Universe at early epochs, we primarily rely on measurements of stellar mass and star formation rate of distant galaxies. In this paper, we present stellar masses and star formation rates of six high-redshift ({\$}2.8\backslashleq z \backslashleq 5.7{\$}) dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) that are strongly gravitationally lensed by foreground galaxies. These sources were first discovered by the South Pole Telescope (SPT) at millimeter wavelengths and all have spectroscopic redshifts and robust lens models derived from ALMA observations. We have conducted follow-up observations, obtaining multi-wavelength imaging data, using {\{}$\backslash$it HST{\}}, {\{}$\backslash$it Spitzer{\}}, {\{}$\backslash$it Herschel{\}} and the Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX). We use the high-resolution {\{}$\backslash$it HST{\}}/WFC3 images to disentangle the background source from the foreground lens in {\{}$\backslash$it Spitzer{\}}/IRAC data. The detections and upper limits provide important constraints on the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for these DSFGs, yielding stellar masses, IR luminosities, and star formation rates (SFRs). The SED fits of six SPT sources show that the intrinsic stellar masses span a range more than one order of magnitude with a median value {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 5 {\$}\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}M{\_}{\{}\backslashSun{\}}{\$}. The intrinsic IR luminosities range from 4{\$}\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}L{\_}{\{}\backslashSun{\}}{\$} to 4{\$}\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}13{\}}L{\_}{\{}\backslashSun{\}}{\$}. They all have prodigious intrinsic star formation rates of 510 to 4800 {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashSun{\}} {\{}\backslashrm yr{\}}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}. Compared to the star-forming main sequence (MS), these six DSFGs have specific SFRs that all lie above the MS, including two galaxies that are a factor of 10 higher than the MS.

abstract = {The spectral absorption lines in early-type galaxies contain a wealth of information regarding the detailed abundance pattern, star formation history, and stellar initial mass function (IMF) of the underlying stellar population. Using our new population synthesis model that accounts for the effect of variable abundance ratios of 11 elements, we analyze very high quality absorption line spectra of 38 early-type galaxies and the nuclear bulge of M31. These data extend to 1um and they therefore include the IMF-sensitive spectral features NaI, CaII, and FeH at 0.82um, 0.86um and 0.99um, respectively. The models fit the data well, with typical rms residuals {\~{}}1{\%}. Strong constraints on the IMF and therefore the stellar mass-to-light ratio, (M/L){\_}stars, are derived for individual galaxies. We find that the IMF becomes increasingly bottom-heavy with increasing velocity dispersion and [Mg/Fe]. At the lowest dispersions and [Mg/Fe] values the derived IMF is consistent with the Milky Way IMF, while at the highest dispersions and [Mg/Fe] values the derived IMF contains more low-mass stars (is more bottom-heavy) than even a Salpeter IMF. Our best-fit (M/L){\_}stars values do not exceed dynamically-based M/L values. We also apply our models to stacked spectra of four metal-rich globular clusters in M31 and find an (M/L){\_}stars that implies fewer low-mass stars than a Milky Way IMF, again agreeing with dynamical constraints. We discuss other possible explanations for the observed trends and conclude that variation in the IMF is the simplest and most plausible.},

abstract = {From the VIMOS VLT Deep Survey (VVDS), we select a sample of 16 galaxies with spectra which identify them as having recently undergone a strong starburst and subsequent fast quenching of star formation. These post-starburst galaxies lie in the redshift range 0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.0 with masses {\textgreater}109.75Msolar. They have a number density of 1 × 10-4 Mpc-3, almost two orders of magnitude sparser than the full galaxy population with the same mass limit. We compare with simulations to show that the galaxies are consistent with being the descendants of gas-rich major mergers. Starburst mass fractions must be larger than {\~{}}5-10 per cent and decay times shorter than {\~{}}108yr for post-starburst (PSB) spectral signatures to be observed in the simulations. We find that the presence of black hole feedback does not greatly affect the evolution of the simulated merger remnants through the PSB phase. The multiwavelength spectral energy distributions of the PSB galaxies show that 5/16 have completely ceased the formation of new stars. These five galaxies correspond to a mass flux entering the red-sequence of , assuming the defining spectroscopic features are detectable for 0.35Gyr. If the galaxies subsequently remain on the red sequence, this accounts for 38+4-11 per cent of the growth rate of the red sequence. Finally, we compare our high-redshift results with a sample of galaxies with 0.05 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.1 observed in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and United Kingdom Infrared Telescope Infrared Deep Survey. We find a very strong redshift evolution: the mass density of strong PSB galaxies is 230 times lower at z {\~{}} 0.07 than at z {\~{}} 0.7.},

abstract = {Using new long-slit spectroscopy obtained with X-Shooter at ESO-VLT, we study, for the first time, radial gradients of optical and near-infrared initial mass function (IMF)-sensitive features in a representative sample of galaxies at the very high mass end of the galaxy population. The sample consists of seven early-type galaxies (ETGs) at z ∼ 0.05, with central velocity dispersion in the range 300 ≲ $\sigma$ ≲ 350 km s-1. Using state-of-the-art stellar population synthesis models, we fit a number of spectral indices, from different chemical species (including TiO and Na indices), to constrain the IMF slope (i.e. the fraction of lowmass stars), as a function of galactocentric distance, over a radial range out to ∼4 kpc. ETGs in our sample show a significant correlation of IMF slope and surface mass density. The bottom-heavy population (i.e. an excess of low-mass stars in the IMF) is confined to central galaxy regions with surface mass density above ∼ 1010M kpc-2, or, alternatively, within a characteristic radius of ∼2 kpc. Radial distance, in physical units, and surface mass density are the best correlators to IMF variations, with respect to other dynamical (e.g. velocity dispersion) and stellar population (e.g. metallicity) properties. Our results for the most massive galaxies suggest that there is no single parameter that fully explains variations in the stellar IMF, but IMF radial profiles at z ∼ 0 rather result from the complex formation and mass accretion history of galaxy inner and outer regions.},

abstract = {This paper presents the second data release of the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program, a wide-field optical imaging survey using the 8.2 m Subaru Telescope. The release includes data from 174 nights of observation through 2018 January. The Wide layer data cover about 300 deg2 in all five broad-band filters (grizy) to the nominal survey exposure (10 min in gr and 20 min in izy). Partially observed areas are also included in the release; about 1100 deg2 is observed in at least one filter and one exposure. The median seeing in the i-band is 0.''6, demonstrating the superb image quality of the survey. The Deep (26 deg2) and UltraDeep (4 deg2) data are jointly processed and the UltraDeep-COSMOS field reaches an unprecedented depth of i ∼ 28 at 5 $\sigma$ for point sources. In addition to the broad-band data, narrow-band data are also available in the Deep and UltraDeep fields. This release includes a major update to the processing pipeline, including improved sky subtraction, PSF modeling, object detection, and artifact rejection. The overall data quality has been improved, but this release is not without problems; there is a persistent deblender problem as well as new issues with masks around bright stars. The user is encouraged to review the issue list before utilizing the data for scientific explorations. All the image products as well as catalog products are available for download. The catalogs are also loaded into a database, which provides an easy interface for users to retrieve data for objects of interest. In addition to these main data products, detailed galaxy shape measurements withheld from Public Data Release 1 (PDR1) are now available to the community. The shape catalog is drawn from the S16A internal release, which has a larger area than PDR1 (160 deg2). All products are available at the data release site, https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/.},

abstract = {We use very deep near-infrared photometry of the Hubble Deep Field-South taken with ISAAC on the Very Large Telescope to identify a population of high-redshift galaxies with rest-frame optical colors similar to those of nearby galaxies. The galaxies are chosen by their infrared colors Js-Ks{\textgreater}2.3, aimed at selecting galaxies with redshifts above 2. When applied to our data set, we find 14 galaxies with Ks{\textless}22.5, corresponding to a surface density of 3+/-0.8 arcmin-2. The photometric redshifts all lie above 1.9, with a median of 2.6 and an rms of 0.7. The spectral energy distributions of these galaxies show a wide range. One is very blue in the rest-frame UV and satisfies the normal Lyman break criteria for high-redshift, star-forming galaxies. Others are quite red throughout the observed spectral range and are extremely faint in the optical, with a median V=26.6. Hence, these galaxies would not be included in photometric samples based on optical ground-based data, and spectroscopic follow-up is difficult. The spectral energy distributions often show a prominent break, identified as the Balmer break or the 4000 {\AA} break. The median age is 1 Gyr when fitted with a constant star formation model with dust or 0.7 Gyr when fitted with a single burst model. Although significantly younger ages cannot be excluded when a larger range of models is allowed, the results indicate that these galaxies are among the oldest at these redshifts. The volume density to Ks=22.5 is half that of Lyman break galaxies at z{\~{}}3. Since the mass-to-light ratios of the red galaxies are likely to be higher, the stellar mass density is inferred to be comparable to that of Lyman break galaxies. These red galaxies may be the descendants of galaxies that started to form stars at very high redshifts, and they may evolve into the most massive galaxies at low redshift.

Our LAEs reach unprecedented depths, both in Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} luminosities and UV absolute magnitudes, from log({\$}L{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Ly\backslashalpha{\}}{\$}/erg s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}) {\$}\backslashsim{\$}41.0 to 43.0 and from Muv {\$}\backslashsim{\$} -16 to -21 (0.01-1.0 {\$}L{\^{}}{\{}*{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm z=3{\}}{\$}). The EW values span the range of {\$}\backslashsim{\$} 5 to 240 $\backslash$AA$\backslash$ or larger, and their distribution can be well fitted by an exponential law {\$}N = N{\_}{\{}\backslashrm 0{\}}{\$} exp({\$}-{\$}EW/{\$}w{\_}{\{}\backslashrm 0{\}}{\$}). Owing to the high dynamic range in Muv, we find that the scale factor, {\$}w{\_}{\{}\backslashrm 0{\}}{\$}, depends on Muv in the sense that including fainter Muv objects increases {\$}w{\_}{\{}\backslashrm 0{\}}{\$}, i.e., the Ando effect.

abstract = {The rest-frame ultraviolet properties of galaxies during the first three billion years of cosmic time (redshift z {\textgreater} 4) indicate a rapid evolution in the dust obscuration of such galaxies. This evolution implies a change in the average properties of the interstellar medium, but the measurements are systematically uncertain owing to untested assumptions and the inability to detect heavily obscured regions of the galaxies. Previous attempts to measure the interstellar medium directly in normal galaxies at these redshifts have failed for a number of reasons, with two notable exceptions. Here we report measurements of the forbidden C ii emission (that is, [C II]) from gas, and the far-infrared emission from dust, in nine typical star-forming galaxies about one billion years after the Big Bang (z ≈ 5-6). We find that these galaxies have thermal emission that is less than 1/12 that of similar systems about two billion years later, and enhanced [C II] emission relative to the far-infrared continuum, confirming a strong evolution in the properties of the interstellar medium in the early Universe. The gas is distributed over scales of one to eight kiloparsecs, and shows diverse dynamics within the sample. These results are consistent with early galaxies having significantly less dust than typical galaxies seen at z {\textless} 3 and being comparable in dust content to local low-metallicity systems.},

Assuming similar broad component profiles for [OIII] and Halpha emission, we estimate a mass loading factor {\~{}}0.2, similar to low stellar mass galaxies at z{\textgreater}1 even if the star formation rates of our sample is 10 times higher. We hypothesize that either the multi-phase nature of supernovae driven outflows or the suppression of winds in the extreme star-forming regime is responsible for the weak signature of outflows in the EoR analogues.},

abstract = {This paper uses radial colour profiles to infer the distributions of dust, gas and star formation in z=0.4-1.4 star-forming main sequence galaxies. We start with the standard UVJ-based method to estimate dust extinction and specific star formation rate (sSFR). By replacing J with I band, a new calibration method suitable for use with ACS+WFC3 data is created (i.e. UVI diagram). Using a multi-wavelength multi-aperture photometry catalogue based on CANDELS, UVI colour profiles of 1328 galaxies are stacked in stellar mass and redshift bins. The resulting colour gradients, covering a radial range of 0.2--2.0 effective radii, increase strongly with galaxy mass and with global {\$}A{\_}V{\$}. Colour gradient directions are nearly parallel to the Calzetti extinction vector, indicating that dust plays a more important role than stellar population variations. With our calibration, the resulting {\$}A{\_}V{\$} profiles fall much more slowly than stellar mass profiles over the measured radial range. sSFR gradients are nearly flat without central quenching signatures, except for {\$}M{\_}*{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}10.5{\}} M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, where central declines of 20--25 per cent are observed. Both sets of profiles agree well with previous radial sSFR and (continuum) {\$}A{\_}V{\$} measurements. They are also consistent with the sSFR profiles and, if assuming a radially constant gas-to-dust ratio, gas profiles in recent hydrodynamic models. We finally discuss the striking findings that SFR scales with stellar mass density in the inner parts of galaxies, and that dust content is high in the outer parts despite low stellar-mass surface densities there.},

abstract = {We describe the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV), a project encompassing three major spectroscopic programs. The Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment 2 (APOGEE-2) is observing hundreds of thousands of Milky Way stars at high resolution and high signal-to-noise ratio in the near-infrared. The Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey is obtaining spatially-resolved spectroscopy for thousands of nearby galaxies (median redshift of z = 0.03). The extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) is mapping the galaxy, quasar, and neutral gas distributions between redshifts z = 0.6 and 3.5 to constrain cosmology using baryon acoustic oscillations, redshift space distortions, and the shape of the power spectrum. Within eBOSS, we are conducting two major subprograms: the SPectroscopic IDentification of eROSITA Sources (SPIDERS), investigating X-ray AGN and galaxies in X-ray clusters, and the Time Domain Spectroscopic Survey (TDSS), obtaining spectra of variable sources. All programs use the 2.5-meter Sloan Foundation Telescope at Apache Point Observatory; observations there began in Summer 2014. APOGEE-2 also operates a second near-infrared spectrograph at the 2.5-meter du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory, with observations beginning in early 2017. Observations at both facilities are scheduled to continue through 2020. In keeping with previous SDSS policy, SDSS-IV provides regularly scheduled public data releases; the first one, Data Release 13, was made available in July 2016.},

abstract = {Stellar kinematics provide insights into the masses and formation histories of galaxies. At high redshifts, spatially resolving the stellar kinematics of quiescent galaxies is challenging due to their compact sizes. Using deep near-infrared spectroscopy, we have measured the resolved stellar kinematics of four quiescent galaxies at z=1.95-2.64, introduced in Paper I, that are gravitationally lensed by galaxy clusters. Analyses of two of these have previously been reported individually by Newman et al. and Toft et al., and for the latter we present new observations. All four galaxies show significant rotation and can be classified as "fast rotators." In the three systems for which the lensing constraints permit a reconstruction of the source, we find that all are likely to be highly flattened (intrinsic ellipticities of {\$}\backslashapprox0.75-0.85{\$}) disk-dominated galaxies with rapid rotation speeds of {\$}V{\_}{\{}\backslashrm max{\}}=290-352{\$} km/s and predominantly rotational support, as indicated by the ratio {\$}(V/\backslashsigma){\_}{\{}R{\_}e{\}}=1.7-2.3{\$}. Compared to coeval star-forming galaxies of similar mass, the quiescent galaxies have smaller {\$}V/\backslashsigma{\$}. Given their high masses {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm dyn{\}} \backslashgtrsim 2\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, we argue that these galaxies are likely to evolve into "slow rotator" elliptical galaxies whose specific angular momentum is reduced by a factor of 5-10. This provides strong evidence for merger-driven evolution of massive galaxies after quenching. Consistent with indirect evidence from earlier morphological studies, our small but unique sample suggests that the kinematic transformations that produced round, dispersion-supported elliptical galaxies were not generally coincident with quenching. Such galaxies probably emerged later via mergers that increased their masses and sizes while also eroding their rotational support.},

abstract = {We present a set of low resolution empirical SED templates for AGNs and galaxies in the wavelength range from 0.03 to 30 microns based on the multi-wavelength photometric observations of the NOAO Deep-Wide Field Survey Bootes field and the spectroscopic observations of the AGN and Galaxy Evolution Survey. Our training sample is comprised of 14448 galaxies in the redshift range 0{\textless}{\~{}}z{\textless}{\~{}}1 and 5347 likely AGNs in the range 0{\textless}{\~{}}z{\textless}{\~{}}5.58. We use our templates to determine photometric redshifts for galaxies and AGNs. While they are relatively accurate for galaxies, their accuracies for AGNs are a strong function of the luminosity ratio between the AGN and galaxy components. Somewhat surprisingly, the relative luminosities of the AGN and its host are well determined even when the photometric redshift is significantly in error. We also use our templates to study the mid-IR AGN selection criteria developed by Stern et al.(2005) and Lacy et al.(2004). We find that the Stern et al.(2005) criteria suffers from significant incompleteness when there is a strong host galaxy component and at z ={\~{}} 4.5, when the broad Halpha emission line is redshifted into the [3.6] band, but that it is little contaminated by low and intermediate redshift galaxies. The Lacy et al.(2004) criterion is not affected by incompleteness at z ={\~{}} 4.5 and is somewhat less affected by strong galaxy host components, but is heavily contaminated by low redshift star forming galaxies. Finally, we use our templates to predict the color-color distribution of sources in the upcoming WISE mission and define a color criterion to select AGNs analogous to those developed for IRAC photometry. We estimate that in between 640,000 and 1,700,000 AGNs will be identified by these criteria, but will have serious completeness problems for z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 3.4.},

This result may suggest that different fractions of the massive gas reservoirs are located in the dense, star-forming nuclear regions - consistent with the more extended sizes of the [CII] emission compared to the dust continuum and higher [CII]-to-far-infrared luminosity ratios in those galaxies with lower gas excitation. We thus find substantial variations in the conditions for star formation between {\$}z{\$}{\$}{\textgreater}{\$}5 dusty starbursts, which typically have dust temperatures {\$}\backslashsim{\$}57{\%}{\$}\backslashpm{\$}25{\%} warmer than starbursts at {\$}z{\$}=2-3 due to their enhanced star formation activity.},

abstract = {We review the physical properties of nearby, relatively luminous galaxies, using results from newly available massive data sets together with more detailed observations. First, we present the global distribution of properties, including the optical and ultraviolet luminosity, stellar mass, and atomic gas mass functions. Second, we describe the shift of the galaxy population from "late" galaxy types in underdense regions to "early" galaxy types in overdense regions. We emphasize that the scaling relations followed by each galaxy type change very little with environment, with the exception of some minor but detectable effects. The shift in the population is apparent even at the densities of small groups and therefore cannot be exclusively due to physical processes operating in rich clusters. Third, we divide galaxies into four crude types -- spiral, lenticular, elliptical, and merging systems -- and describe some of their more detailed properties. We attempt to put these detailed properties into the global context provided by large surveys.},

abstract = {We derive the SFH of MS galaxies showing how the SFH peak of a galaxy depends on its seed mass at e.g. z=5. Following the MS, galaxies undergo a drastic slow down of their stellar mass growth after reaching the peak of their SFH. According to abundance matching, these masses correspond to hot and massive DM halos which state could results in less efficient gas inflows on the galaxies and thus could be at the origin of the limited stellar mass growth. As a result, galaxies on the MS can enter the passive region of the UVJ diagram while still forming stars. The ability of the classical analytical SFHs to retrieve the SFR of galaxies from SED fitting is studied. Due to mathematical limitations, the exp-declining and delayed SFH struggle to model high SFR which starts to be problematic at z{\textgreater}2. The exp-rising and log-normal SFHs exhibit the opposite behavior with the ability to reach very high SFR, and thus model starburst galaxies, but not low values such as those expected at low redshift for massive galaxies. We show that these four analytical forms recover the SFR of MS galaxies with an error dependent on the model and the redshift. They are, however, sensitive enough to probe small variations of SFR within the MS but all the four fail to recover the SFR of rapidly quenched galaxies. However, these SFHs lead to an artificial gradient of age, parallel to the MS which is not exhibited by a simulated sample. This gradient is also produced on real data, using a sample of GOODS-South galaxies at 1.5{\textless}z{\textless}1.2. We propose a SFH composed of a delayed form to model the bulk of stellar population plus a flexibility in the recent SFH. This SFH provides very good estimates of the SFR of MS, starbursts, and rapidly quenched galaxies at all z. Furthermore, used on the GOODS-South sample, the age gradient disappears, showing its dependency on the SFH assumption made to perform the SED fitting.},

The companion paper by Rest et al. (2013) describes the photometric measurements and cosmological inferences from the PS1 sample. The largest systematic uncertainty stems from the photometric calibration of the PS1 and low-z samples. We increase the sample of observed Calspec standards from 7 to 10 used to define the PS1 calibration system. The PS1 and SDSS-II calibration systems are compared and discrepancies up to {\~{}}0.02 mag are recovered. We find uncertainties in the proper way to treat intrinsic colors and reddening produce differences in the recovered value of w up to 3{\%}. We estimate masses of host galaxies of PS1 supernovae and detect an insignificant difference in distance residuals of the full sample of 0.040$\backslash$pm0.031 mag for host galaxies with high and low masses.

We determine the SFHs of individual galaxies by simultaneously fitting rest-frame optical spectroscopy and broadband photometry to stellar population models. We confirm that the SFHs are consistent with more massive galaxies having on average earlier formation times.

We place this result in the context of two simple quenching models and show that neither environmental quenching based on time since infall (without pre-processing) nor a difference in formation times alone can reproduce both the average age difference and relative quenched fractions. This is distinctly different from local clusters, for which the majority of the quenched population is consistent with having been environmentally quenched upon infall. Our results suggest that quenched population in galaxy clusters at z{\textgreater}1 has been driven by different physical processes than those at play at z=0.},

abstract = {We discuss the rest-frame ultraviolet emission from the starbursting galaxy HFLS3 at a redshift of 6.34. The galaxy was discovered in Herschel/SPIRE data due to its red color in the submillimeter wavelengths from 250 to 500 $\mu$m. Keck/NIRC2 K s -band adaptive optics imaging data showed two potential near-IR counterparts near HFLS3. Previously, the northern galaxy was taken to be in the foreground at z = 2.1, while the southern galaxy was assumed to be HFLS3's near-IR counterpart. The recently acquired Hubble/WFC3 and Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) imaging data show conclusively that both optically bright galaxies are in the foreground at z {\textless} 6. A new lensing model based on the Hubble imaging data and the millimeter-wave continuum emission yields a magnification factor of 2.2 ± 0.3, with a 95{\%} confidence upper limit on the magnification of 3.5. When corrected for lensing, the instantaneous star formation rate is 1320 M yr -1 , with the 95{\%} confidence lower limit around 830 M yr -1 . The dust and stellar masses of HFLS3 from the same spectral energy distribution (SED) models are at the level of 3 × 10 8 M and 5 × 10 10 M , respectively, with large systematic uncertainties on assumptions related to the SED model. With Hubble/WFC3 images, we also find diffuse near-IR emission about 0.5 arcsec (3 kpc) to the southwest of HFLS3 that remains undetected in the ACS imaging data. The emission has a photometric redshift consistent with either z 6 or a dusty galaxy template at z 2. {\textcopyright} 2014. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..},

With the advent of ALMA, it has become possible to detect far-infrared fine structure lines (e.g. [CII] 158 µm and [OIII] 88 µm) and dust continuum emission in star-forming galaxies in the EoR. Among these lines, our team is focusing on [OIII] 88 µm observations in high-z galaxies. After the first detection of [OIII] in the epoch of reionization (EoR) in 2016 from our team at z = 7.21, there are now more than ten [OIII] detections at z {\textgreater} 6 up to z = 9.11. Interestingly, high-z galaxies typically have very high [OIII]-to-[CII] luminosity ratio ranging from 3 to 12 or higher, demonstrating [OIII] is a powerful tracer at high-z. The high luminosity ratios may imply that high-z galaxies have low gas-phase metallicity and/or high ionization states.},

Our sample includes a robust sub-sample of 61 objects for which we confidently exclude low-redshift and star-forming solutions. We identify 10 robust objects at {\$}z{\textgreater}3{\$}, of which 2 are at {\$}z{\textgreater}4{\$}. We report formation redshifts, demonstrating that the oldest objects formed at {\$}z {\textgreater} 6{\$}, however individual ages from our photometric data have significant uncertainties, typically {\$}\backslashsim0.5{\$} Gyr. We demonstrate that the UVJ colours of the quiescent population evolve with redshift at {\$}z{\textgreater}3{\$}, becoming bluer and more similar to post-starburst galaxies at lower redshift. Based upon this we construct a model for the time-evolution of quiescent galaxy UVJ colours, concluding that the oldest objects are consistent with forming the bulk of their stellar mass at {\$}z\backslashsim6-7{\$} and quenching at {\$}z\backslashsim5{\$}. We report spectroscopic redshifts for two of our objects at {\$}z=3.440{\$} and {\$}3.396{\$}, which exhibit extremely weak Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emission in ultra-deep VANDELS spectra. We calculate star-formation rates based on these line fluxes, finding that these galaxies are consistent with our quiescent selection criteria, provided their Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} escape fractions are {\$}{\textgreater}3{\$} and {\$}{\textgreater}10{\$} per cent respectively. We finally report that our highest-redshift robust object exhibits a continuum break at {\$}\backslashlambda\backslashsim7000{\$}A in a spectrum from VUDS, consistent with our photometric redshift of {\$}z{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}phot{\}}=4.72{\^{}}{\{}+0.06{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.04{\}}{\$}. If confirmed this object would be the highest-redshift known quiescent galaxy. In order to obtain stronger constraints on the times of the earliest quenching events, high-SNR spectroscopy must be extended to {\$}z\backslashgtrsim3{\$} quiescent objects.},

abstract = {How much gas and dust is contained in high-redshift quiescent galaxies (QGs) is currently an open question with relatively few and contradictory answers, as well as important implications for our understanding of the nature of star formation quenching processes at cosmic noon. Here we revisit far-infrared (FIR) observations of the REQUIEM-ALMA sample of six z = 1.6 - 3.2 QGs strongly lensed by intermediate-redshift galaxy clusters. We measured their continuum emission using priors obtained from high resolution near-infrared (NIR) imaging, as opposed to focusing on point-source extraction, converted it into dust masses using a FIR dust emission model derived from statistical samples of QGs, and compared the results to those of the reference work. We find that, while at least the most massive sample galaxy is indeed dust-poor, the picture is much more nuanced than previously reported. In particular, these more conservative constraints remain consistent with high dust fractions in early QGs. We find that these measurements are very sensitive to the adopted extraction method and conversion factors: the use of an extended light model to fit the FIR emission increases the flux of detections by up to 50{\%} and the upper limit by up to a factor 6. Adding the FIR-to-dust conversion, this amounts to an order of magnitude difference in dust fraction, casting doubts on the power of these data to discriminate between star formation quenching scenarios. Unless these are identified by other means, mapping the dust and gas in high-redshift QGs will continue to require somewhat costly observations.},

abstract = {We examine how HI and metal absorption lines within low-redshift galaxy halos trace the dynamical state of circumgalactic gas, using cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include a well-vetted heuristic model for galactic outflows. We categorize inflowing, outflowing, and ambient gas based on its history and fate as tracked in our simulation. Following our earlier work showing that the ionisation level of absorbers was a primary factor in determining the physical conditions of absorbing gas, we show here that it is also a governing factor for its dynamical state. Low-ionisation metal absorbers (e.g. MgII) tend to arise in gas that will fall onto galaxies within several Gyr, while high-ionisation metal absorbers (e.g. OVI) generally trace material that was deposited by outflows many Gyr ago. Inflowing gas is dominated by enriched material that was previously ejected in an outflow, hence accretion at low redshifts is typically substantially enriched. Recycling wind material is preferentially found closer to galaxies, and is more dominant in lower-mass halos since high-mass halos have more hot gas that is able to support itself against infall. Low-mass halos also tend to re-eject more of their accreted material, owing to our outflow prescription that employs higher mass loading factors for lower-mass galaxies. Typical HI absorbers trace unenriched ambient material that is not participating in the baryon cycle, but stronger HI absorbers arise in cool, enriched inflowing gas. Instantaneous radial velocity measures of absorbers are generally poor at distinguishing between inflowing and outflowing gas, except in the case of very recent outflows. These results suggest that probing halo gas using a range of absorbers can provide detailed information about the amount and physical conditions of material that is participating in the baryon cycle.},

We combine new z {\~{}} 5 measurements of HI Ly a and lowand high-ionization interstellar metal absorption features with comparable measurements at z {\~{}} 2-4. We measure the equivalent widths of interstellar absorption features using stacked spectra in bins of Ly a equivalent width, performing corrections to Ly a strengths based on a model for the transmission of the intergalactic medium. We find a strong correlation between decreasing low-ionization absorption strength and increasing Ly a emission strength over the redshift range z {\~{}} 2-5, suggesting that both of these quantities are fundamentally linked to neutral gas covering fraction. At the highest Ly a equivalent widths, we observe evolution at z {\~{}} 5 towards greater Ly a emission strength at fixed low-ionization absorption strength. If we interpret the non-evolving relationship of Ly a emission strength and low-ionization line strength at z {\~{}} 2-4 as primarily reflecting the radiative transfer of Ly $\alpha$ photons, this evolution at z {\~{}} 5 suggests a higher intrinsic production rate of Ly a photons than at lower redshift. Our conclusion is supported by the joint evolution of the relationships among Ly $\alpha$ emission strength, interstellar absorption strength, and dust reddening.We perform additional analysis in bins of stellar mass, star formation rate, UV luminosity, and age, examining how the relationships between galaxy properties and Ly a emission evolve towards higher redshift. We conclude that increasing intrinsic Ly a photon production and strong detection of nebular C IV emission (signalling lower metallicity) at z {\~{}} 5 indicate an elevated ionized photon production efficiency ($\zeta$ion).},

abstract = {We present the core mass function (CMF) of the massive star-forming clump G33.92+0.11 using 1.3 mm observations obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). With a resolution of 1000 au, this is one of the highest resolution CMF measurements to date. The CMF is corrected by flux and number incompleteness to obtain a sample that is complete for gas masses {\$}M\backslashgtrsim2.0\backslash M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. The resulting CMF is well represented by a power-law function ({\$}dN/d\backslashlog M\backslashpropto M{\^{}}\backslashGamma{\$}), whose slope is determined using two different approaches: {\$}i){\$} by least-squares fitting of power-law functions to the flux- and number-corrected CMF, and {\$}ii){\$} by comparing the observed CMF to simulated samples with similar incompleteness. We provide a prescription to quantify and correct a flattening bias affecting the slope fits in the first approach, which is caused by small-sample or edge effects when the data is represented by either classical histograms or a kernel density estimate, respectively. The resulting slopes from both approaches are in good agreement each other, with {\$}\backslashGamma=-1.11{\_}{\{}-0.11{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+0.12{\}}{\$} being our adopted value. Although this slope appears to be slightly flatter than the Salpeter slope {\$}\backslashGamma=-1.35{\$} for the stellar initial mass function (IMF), we find from Monte Carlo simulations that the CMF in G33.92+0.11 is statistically indistinguishable from the Salpeter representation of the stellar IMF. Our results are consistent with the idea that the form of the IMF is inherited from the CMF, at least at high masses and when the latter is observed at high-enough resolution.},

abstract = {Context. Cluster galaxies are the ideal sites to look at when studying the influence of the environment on the various aspects of the evolution of galaxies, such as the changes in their stellar content and morphological transformations. In the framework of wings, the WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey, we have obtained optical spectra for ∼6000 galaxies selected in fields centred on 48 local (0.04 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.07) X-ray selected clusters to tackle these issues. Aims. By classifying the spectra based on given spectral lines, we investigate the frequency of the various spectral types as a function of both the clusters' properties and the galaxies' characteristics. In this way, using the same classification criteria adopted for studies at higher redshift, we can consistently compare the properties of the local cluster population to those of their more distant counterparts. Methods. We describe a method that we have developed to automatically measure the equivalent width of spectral lines in a robust way, even in spectra with a non optimal signal-to-noise ratio. This way, we can derive a spectral classification reflecting the stellar content, based on the presence and strength of the [Oii] and H$\delta$ lines. Results. After a quality check, we are able to measure 4381 of the ∼6000 originally observed spectra in the fields of 48 clusters, of which 2744 are spectroscopically confirmed cluster members. The spectral classification is then analysed as a function of galaxies' luminosity, stellar mass, morphology, local density, and host cluster's global properties and compared to higher redshift samples (MORPHS and EDisCS). The vast majority of galaxies in the local clusters population are passive objects, being also the most luminous and massive. At a magnitude limit of M V {\textless} -18, galaxies in a post-starburst phase represent only ∼11{\%} of the cluster population, and this fraction is reduced to ∼5{\%} at M V {\textless} -19.5, which compares to the 18{\%} at the same magnitude limit for high-z clusters. "Normal" star-forming galaxies (e(c)) are proportionally more common in local clusters. Conclusions. The relative occurrence of post-starbursts suggests a very similar quenching efficiency in clusters at redshifts in the 0 to ∼1 range. Furthermore, more important than the global environment, the local density seems to be the main driver of galaxy evolution in local clusters at least with respect to their stellar populations content. {\textcopyright} ESO, 2014.},

abstract = {We present results from 13 cosmological simulations that explore the parameter space of the 'Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies and their Environments' (EAGLE) simulation project. Four of the simulations follow the evolution of a periodic cube L=50 cMpc on a side, and each employs a different subgrid model of the energetic feedback associated with star formation. The relevant parameters were adjusted so that the simulations each reproduce the observed galaxy stellar mass function at z = 0.1. Three of the simulations fail to form disc galaxies as extended as observed, and we show analytically that this is a consequence of numerical radiative losses that reduce the efficiency of stellar feedback in high-density gas. Such losses are greatly reduced in the fourth simulation - the EAGLE reference model - by injecting more energy in higher density gas. This model produces galaxies with the observed size distribution, and also reproduces many galaxy scaling relations. In the remaining nine simulations, a single parameter or process of the reference model was varied at a time. We find that the properties of galaxies with stellar mass ≲ M* (the 'knee' of the galaxy stellar mass function) are largely governed by feedback associated with star formation, while those of more massive galaxies are also controlled by feedback from accretion on to their central black holes. Both processes must be efficient in order to reproduce the observed galaxy population. In general, simulations that have been calibrated to reproduce the low-redshift galaxy stellar mass function will still not form realistic galaxies, but the additional requirement that galaxy sizes be acceptable leads to agreement with a large range of observables.},

abstract = {Selecting the first galaxies at z {\textgreater} 7 − 10 from JWST surveys is complicated by z {\textless} 6 contaminants with degenerate photometry. For example, strong optical nebular emission lines at z {\textless} 6 may mimic JWST/NIRCam photometry of z {\textgreater} 7–10 Lyman-break galaxies (LBGs). Dust-obscured 3 {\textless} z {\textless} 6 galaxies in particular are potentially important contaminants, and their faint rest-optical spectra have been historically difficult to observe. A lack of optical emission line and continuum measures for 3 {\textless} z {\textless} 6 dusty galaxies now makes it difficult to test their expected JWST/NIRCam photometry for degenerate solutions with NIRCam dropouts. Toward this end, we quantify the contribution by strong emission lines to NIRCam photometry in a physically motivated manner by stacking 21 Keck II/NIRES spectra of hot, dust-obscured, massive ( log M * / M ⊙ ≳ 10 – 11 ) and infrared (IR) luminous galaxies at z ∼ 1–4. We derive an average spectrum and measure strong narrow (broad) [O iii ] 5007 and H $\alpha$ features with equivalent widths of 130 ± 20 {\AA} (150 ± 50 {\AA}) and 220 ± 30 {\AA} (540 ± 80 {\AA}), respectively. These features can increase broadband NIRCam fluxes by factors of 1.2 − 1.7 (0.2–0.6 mag). Due to significant dust attenuation ( A V ∼ 6), we find H $\alpha$ +[N ii ] to be significantly brighter than [O iii ]+H $\beta$ and therefore find that emission-line dominated contaminants of high − z galaxy searches can only reproduce moderately blue perceived UV continua of S $\lambda$ ∝ $\lambda$ $\beta$ with $\beta$ {\textgreater} − 1.5 and z {\textgreater} 4. While there are some redshifts ( z ∼ 3.75) where our stack is more degenerate with the photometry of z {\textgreater} 10 LBGs at $\lambda$ rest ∼ 0.3–0.8 $\mu$ m , redder filter coverage beyond $\lambda$ obs {\textgreater} 3.5 $\mu$ m and far-IR/submillimeter follow-up may be useful for breaking the degeneracy and making a crucial separation between two fairly unconstrained populations, dust-obscured galaxies at z ∼ 3–6 and LBGs at z {\textgreater} 10.},

abstract = {Most stars and their planets form in open clusters. Over 95 per cent of such clusters have stellar densities too low (less than a hundred stars per cubic parsec) to withstand internal and external dynamical stresses and fall apart within a few hundred million years. Older open clusters have survived by virtue of being richer and denser in stars (1,000 to 10,000 per cubic parsec) when they formed. Such clusters represent a stellar environment very different from the birthplace of the Sun and other planet-hosting field stars. So far more than 800 planets have been found around Sun-like stars in the field. The field planets are usually the size of Neptune or smaller. In contrast, only four planets have been found orbiting stars in open clusters, all with masses similar to or greater than that of Jupiter. Here we report observations of the transits of two Sun-like stars by planets smaller than Neptune in the billion-year-old open cluster NGC6811. This demonstrates that small planets can form and survive in a dense cluster environment, and implies that the frequency and properties of planets in open clusters are consistent with those of planets around field stars in the Galaxy.},

abstract = {We present a new approach to investigate the content and spatial distribution of dust in structurally unresolved star-forming galaxies from the observed dependence of integrated spectral properties on galaxy inclination. Motivated by the observation that different stellar populations reside in different spatial components of nearby star-forming galaxies, we develop an innovative combination of generic models of radiative transfer in dusty media with a prescription for the spectral evolution of galaxies, via the association of different geometric components of galaxies with stars in different age ranges. We start by showing that a wide range of radiative transfer models all predict a quasi-universal relation between slope of the attenuation curve at any wavelength, from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared, and V-band attenuation optical depth in the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM), at all galaxy inclinations. This relation predicts steeper (shallower) dust attenuation curves than both the Calzetti and Milky Way curves at small (large) attenuation optical depths, which implies that geometry and orientation effects have a stronger influence on the shape of the attenuation curve than changes in the optical properties of dust grains. We use our new, combined radiative transfer and spectral evolution model to interpret the observed dependence of the Halpha/Hbeta ratio and ugrizYJH attenuation curve on inclination in a sample of about 23 000 nearby star-forming galaxies, which we correct for systematic biases by developing a general method based on importance sampling. From the exploration of the model parameter space by means of a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, we measure the central face-on B-band optical depth of this sample to be tauB⊥ ≈ 1.8 ± 0.2 (corresponding to an angle-averaged {\{}{\textless} hat{\{}tau{\}}{\^{}}ISM{\_}V{\textgreater} {\_}theta {\}}≈ 0.3). We also quantify the enhanced optical depth towards newly formed stars in their birth clouds, finding this to be significantly larger in galaxies with bulges than in disc-dominated galaxies, while tauB⊥ is roughly similar in both cases. This can arise if, for example, galaxies with significant bulges have higher central star formation efficiencies than their disc-dominated counterparts at a fixed specific star formation rate, and dustier stellar birth clouds because of the higher metallicity. We find that over 80 per cent of the attenuation in galaxies in our sample is characteristic of that affecting thin-disc stars in radiative transfer models. The median unattenuated V-band luminosity ratio of thick-disc to thin-disc stars is 0.1-0.2, in good agreement with the results from spatially resolved studies of nearby edge-on disc galaxies. Finally, we show that neglecting the effect of geometry and orientation on attenuation can severely bias the interpretation of galaxy spectral energy distributions, as the impact on broad-band colours can reach up to 0.3-0.4 mag at optical wavelengths and 0.1 mag at near-infrared ones. This paper also contains an original application of Gaussian random processes to extend the wavelength range of dust attenuation curves.},

abstract = {We show empirically that fits to the color-magnitude relation of Type Ia supernovae after optical maximum can provide accurate relative extragalactic distances. We report the discovery of an empirical color relation for Type Ia light curves: During much of the first month past maximum, the magnitudes of Type Ia supernovae defined at a given value of color index have a very small magnitude dispersion; moreover, during this period the relation between {\$}B{\$} magnitude and {\$}B-V{\$} color (or {\$}B-R{\$} or {\$}B-I{\$} color) is strikingly linear, to the accuracy of existing well-measured data. These linear relations can provide robust distance estimates, in particular, by using the magnitudes when the supernova reaches a given color. After correction for light curve strech factor or decline rate, the dispersion of the magnitudes taken at the intercept of the linear color-magnitude relation are found to be around 0{\$}{\^{}}m{\$}.08 for the sub-sample of supernovae with $\backslash$BVm {\$}\backslashle 0{\^{}}m.05{\$}, and around 0{\$}{\^{}}m{\$}.11 for the sub-sample with $\backslash$BVm {\$}\backslashle 0{\^{}}m.2{\$}. This small dispersion is consistent with being mostly due to observational errors. The method presented here and the conventional light curve fitting methods can be combined to further improve statistical dispersions of distance estimates. It can be combined with the magnitude at maximum to deduce dust extinction. The slopes of the color-magnitude relation may also be used to identify intrinsically different SN Ia systems. The method provides a tool that is fundamental to using SN Ia to estimate cosmological parameters such as the Hubble constant and the mass and dark energy content of the universe.},

Previous work focused on measuring the slope of the IMF over one or more stellar mass intervals, implicitly assuming that this is a good description of the IMF and that the IMF has a universal low-mass cutoff. In this work we consider more flexible IMFs, including two-component power-laws with a variable low-mass cutoff and a general non-parametric model. We demonstrate with mock spectra that the detailed shape of the IMF can be accurately recovered as long as the data quality are high (S/N{\$}\backslashgtrsim300{\$}) and cover a wide wavelength range (0.4um-1.0um). We apply these flexible IMF models to a high S/N spectrum of the center of the massive elliptical galaxy NGC 1407. Fitting the spectrum with non-parametric IMFs, we find that the IMF in the center shows a continuous rise extending toward the hydrogen-burning limit, with a behavior that is well-approximated by a power-law with an index of -2.7. These results provide strong evidence for the existence of extreme (super-Salpeter) IMFs in the cores of massive galaxies.},

abstract = { Using one of the largest volumes of the hydrodynamical cosmological simulation suit Magneticum, we study the evolution of protoclusters identified at redshift ≈ 4, with properties similar to the well-observed protocluster SPT2349-56. We identify 42 protoclusters in the simulation as massive and equally rich in substructures as observed, confirming that these observed structures can already be virialized. The dynamics of the internally fast-rotating member galaxies within these protoclusters resemble observations, merging rapidly to form the cores of the brightest cluster galaxies of the assembling clusters. Half of the gas reservoir of these structures is in a hot phase, with the metal enrichment at a very early stage. These systems show a good agreement with the observed amount of cold star-forming gas, largely enriched to solar values. We predict that some of the member galaxies are already quenched at z ≈ 4, rendering them undetectable through measurements of their gas reservoirs. Tracing the evolution of protoclusters reveals that none of the typical mass indicators at high redshift are good tracers to predict the present-day mass of the system. We find that none of the simulated protoclusters at z = 4.3 are among the top ten most massive clusters at redshift z = 0.2, with some barely reaching masses of M ≈ 2 × 10 14 M ⊙ . Although the average star formation and mass growth rates in the simulated galaxies match observations at high redshift reasonably well, the simulation fails to reproduce the extremely high total star formation rates within the observed protoclusters, indicating that the subgrid models are lacking the ability to reproduce a higher star formation efficiency (or lower depletion timescales). },

This has led to a perceived dearth of dusty systems at {\$}z{\textgreater}4{\$}, and the conclusion, according to some models, that the early Universe was relatively dust-poor. In this paper, we extend the backward evolution galaxy model described by Casey et al. (2018) to the ALMA regime (in depth and area) and determine that the measured number counts and redshift distributions from ALMA deep field surveys are fully consistent with constraints of the infrared luminosity function (IRLF) at {\$}z{\textless}2.5{\$} determined by single-dish submillimeter and millimeter surveys conducted on much larger angular scales ({\$}\backslashsim1-10{\$}deg{\$}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$}).

Recent studies have suggested that UV-selected galaxies at {\$}z{\textgreater}4{\$} may be particularly dust-poor, but we find their millimeter-wave emission cannot rule out consistency with the Calzetti dust attenuation law even by assuming relatively typical, cold-dust ({\$}T{\_}{\{}\backslashrm dust{\}}\backslashapprox30\backslash,{\$}K) SEDs. Our models suggest that the design of ALMA deep fields requires substantial revision to constrain the prevalence of {\$}z{\textgreater}4{\$} early Universe obscured starbursts.

abstract = {We present Ha maps at 1kpc spatial resolution for star-forming galaxies at z{\~{}}1, made possible by the WFC3 grism on HST. Employing this capability over all five 3D-HST/CANDELS fields provides a sample of 2676 galaxies. By creating deep stacked Halpha (Ha) images, we reach surface brightness limits of 1x10{\^{}}-18$\backslash$erg$\backslash$s$\backslash$cm{\^{}}2$\backslash$arcsec{\^{}}2, allowing us to map the distribution of ionized gas out to {\textgreater}10kpc for typical L* galaxies at this epoch. We find that the spatial extent of the Ha distribution increases with stellar mass as r(Ha)[kpc]=1.5(Mstars/10{\^{}}10Msun){\^{}}0.23. Furthermore, the Ha emission is more extended than the stellar continuum emission, consistent with inside-out assembly of galactic disks. This effect, however, is mass dependent with r(Ha)/r(stars)=1.1(M/10{\^{}}10Msun){\^{}}0.054, such that at low masses r(Ha){\~{}}r(stars). We map the Ha distribution as a function of SFR(IR+UV) and find evidence for `coherent star formation' across the SFR-M plane: above the main sequence, Ha is enhanced at all radii; below the main sequence, Ha is depressed at all radii. This suggests that at all masses the physical processes driving the enhancement or suppression of star formation act throughout the disks of galaxies. It also confirms that the scatter in the star forming main sequence is real and caused by variations in the star formation rate at fixed mass. At high masses (10{\^{}}10.5{\textless}M/Msun{\textless}10{\^{}}11), above the main sequence, Ha is particularly enhanced in the center, plausibly building bulges and/or supermassive black holes. Below the main sequence, the star forming disks are more compact and a strong central dip in the EW(Ha), and the inferred specific star formation rate, appears. Importantly though, across the entirety of the SFR-M plane, the absolute star formation rate as traced by Ha is always centrally peaked, even in galaxies below the main sequence.},

abstract = {There are multiple ways in which to select post-starburst galaxies in the literature. In this work, we present a study into how two well-used selection techniques have consequences on observable post-starburst galaxy parameters, such as colour, morphology and environment and how this affects interpretations of their role in the galaxy duty cycle. We identify a master sample of H{\$}\backslashdelta{\$} strong (EW{\$}{\_}{\{}H\backslashdelta{\}}{\$} {\textgreater} 3$\backslash$AA) post-starburst galaxies from the value-added catalogue in the 7th data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS DR7) over a redshift range 0.01 {\textless} {\$}z{\$} {\textless} 0.1. From this sample we select two E+A subsets, both having a very little [OII] emission (EW{\$}{\_}{\{}[OII]{\}}{\$} {\$}{\textgreater} -2.5{\$}$\backslash$AA) but one having an additional cut on EW{\$}{\_}{\{}H\backslashalpha{\}}{\$} ({\$}{\textgreater} -3{\$}$\backslash$AA). We examine the differences in observables and AGN fractions to see what effect the H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} cut has on the properties of post-starburst galaxies and what these differing samples can tell us about the duty cycle of post-starburst galaxies. We find that H{\$}\backslashdelta{\$} strong galaxies peak in the `blue cloud', E+As in the `green valley' and pure E+As in the `red sequence'. We also find that pure E+As have a more early-type morphology and a higher fraction in denser environments compared with the H{\$}\backslashdelta{\$} strong and E+A galaxies. These results suggest that there is an evolutionary sequence in the post-starburst phase from blue disky galaxies with residual star formation to passive red early-types.},

In the low stellar mass regime where {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\textless}10{\^{}}{\{}9.6{\}}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, centrals exhibit systematically longer quenching timescales than satellites ({\$}\backslashapprox 4{\$}Gyr compared to {\$}\backslashapprox 2{\$}Gyr). Satellites with low stellar mass relative to their halo mass cause this disparity, with ram pressure stripping quenching these galaxies rapidly.

EAGLE simulations to analyze quenching timescale and causal mechanisms between high-mass centrals, low-mass centrals, and satellites.
At logMsol{\textless}9.6, centrals have longer quenching timescales than satellites (RPS quenches low mass satellites, while stellar feedback quenches centrals).
At 9.7 {\textless} logMsol {\textless} 10.3, quenching timescales are longest for centrals and satellites.
At logMsol {\textgreater} 10.3, mergers and black hole activity increase, resulting in a shorter quenching timescale.

abstract = {We study the evolutionary trend of the total density profile of early-type galaxies (ETGs) in IllustrisTNG. To this end, we trace ETGs from {\$}z=0{\$} to {\$}z=4{\$} and measure the power-law slope {\$}\backslashgamma{\^{}}{\{}\backslashprime{\}}{\$} of the total density profile for their main progenitors. We find that their {\$}\backslashgamma{\^{}}{\{}\backslashprime{\}}{\$} steepen on average during {\$}z\backslashsim4-2{\$}, then becoming shallower until {\$}z=1{\$}, after which they remain almost constant, aside from a residual trend of becoming shallower towards {\$}z=0{\$}. We also compare to a statistical sample of ETGs at different redshifts, selected based on their luminosity profiles and stellar masses. Due to different selection effects, the average slopes of the statistical samples follow a modified evolutionary trend. They monotonically decrease since {\$}z=3{\$}, and after {\$}z\backslashapprox 1{\$}, they remain nearly invariant with a mild increase towards {\$}z=0{\$}. These evolutionary trends are mass-dependent for both samples, with low-mass galaxies having in general steeper slopes than their more massive counterparts. Galaxies that transitioned to ETGs more recently have steeper mean slopes as they tend to be smaller and more compact at any given redshift. By analyzing the impact of mergers and AGN feedback on the progenitors' evolution, we conjecture a multi-phase path leading to isothermality in ETGs: dissipation associated with rapid wet mergers tends to steepen {\$}\backslashgamma{\^{}}{\{}\backslashprime{\}}{\$} from {\$}z=4{\$} to {\$}z=2{\$}, whereas subsequent AGN feedback (especially in the kinetic mode) makes {\$}\backslashgamma{\^{}}{\{}\backslashprime{\}}{\$} shallower again from {\$}z=2{\$} to {\$}z=1{\$}. Afterwards, passive evolution from {\$}z=1{\$} to {\$}z=0{\$}, mainly through gas-poor mergers, mildly decreases {\$}\backslashgamma{\^{}}{\{}\backslashprime{\}}{\$} and maintains the overall mass distribution close to isothermal.},

abstract = {We evaluate the effects of environment and stellar mass on galaxy properties at 0.85 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.20 using a 3.6um-selected spectroscopic sample of 797 cluster and field galaxies drawn from the GCLASS survey. We confirm that for galaxies with LogM* {\textgreater} 9.3 the well-known correlations between environment and properties such as star-forming fraction (f{\_}SF), SFR, SSFR, D(4000), and color are already in place at z {\~{}} 1. We separate the effects of environment and stellar mass on galaxies by comparing the properties of star-forming and quiescent galaxies at fixed environment, and fixed stellar mass. The SSFR of star-forming galaxies at fixed environment is correlated with stellar mass; however, at fixed stellar mass it is independent of environment. The same trend exists for the D(4000) measures of both the star-forming and quiescent galaxies and shows that their properties are determined primarily by their stellar mass, not by their environment. Instead, it appears that environment's primary role is to control the fraction of star-forming galaxies. Using the spectra we identify candidate poststarburst galaxies and find that those with 9.3 {\textless} LogM* {\textless} 10.7 are 3.1 +/- 1.1 times more common in high-density regions compared to low-density regions. The clear association of poststarbursts with high-density regions as well as the lack of a correlation between the SSFRs and D(4000)s of star-forming galaxies with their environment suggests that at z {\~{}} 1 the environmental-quenching timescale must be rapid. Lastly, we construct a simple quenching model which demonstrates that the lack of a correlation between the D(4000) of quiescent galaxies and their environment results naturally if self quenching dominates over environmental quenching at z {\textgreater} 1, or if the evolution of the self-quenching rate mirrors the evolution of the environmental-quenching rate at z {\textgreater} 1, regardless of which dominates.},

abstract = {Upcoming space-based surveys such as Euclid and WFIRST-AFTA plan to measure Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAOs) in order to study dark energy. These surveys will use IR slitless grism spectroscopy to measure redshifts of a large number of galaxies over a significant redshift range. In this paper, we use the WFC3 Infrared Spectroscopic Parallel Survey (WISP) to estimate the expected number of Halpha (Ha) emitters observable by these future surveys. WISP is an ongoing HST slitless spectroscopic survey, covering the 0.8-1.65micron wavelength range and allowing the detection of Ha emitters up to z{\~{}}1.5 and [OIII] emitters to z{\~{}}2.3. We derive the Ha-[OIII] bivariate line luminosity function for WISP galaxies at z{\~{}}1 using a maximum likelihood estimator that properly accounts for uncertainties in line luminosity measurement, and demonstrate how it can be used to derive the Ha luminosity function from exclusively fitting [OIII] data. Using the z{\~{}}2 [OIII] line luminosity function, and assuming that the relation between Ha and [OIII] luminosity does not change significantly over the redshift range, we predict the Ha number counts at z{\~{}}2 - the upper end of the redshift range of interest for the future surveys. For the redshift range 0.7{\textless}z{\textless}2, we expect {\~{}}3000 galaxies/deg{\^{}}2 for a flux limit of 3x10{\^{}}{\{}-16{\}} ergs/s/cm{\^{}}2 (the proposed depth of Euclid galaxy redshift survey) and {\~{}}20,000 galaxies/deg{\^{}}2 for a flux limit of {\~{}}10{\^{}}{\{}-16{\}} ergs/s/cm{\^{}}2 (the baseline depth of WFIRST galaxy redshift survey).},

abstract = {We analyze the rest-optical emission-line ratios of z{\~{}}1.5 galaxies drawn from the MOSDEF survey. Based on composite spectra we investigate the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at z{\~{}}1.5 and measure its evolution to z=0. When using gas-phase metallicities based on the N2 line ratio, we find that the difference between the MZR at z{\~{}}1.5 and z=0 depends on stellar mass, with a difference of {\$}\backslashDelta\backslashrm log(\backslashrm O/H)\backslashsim0.25{\$} dex at {\$}M{\_}* {\textless}10{\^{}}{\{}9.75{\}}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} down to {\$}\backslashDelta\backslashrm log(\backslashrm O/H)\backslashsim0.05{\$} for galaxies with {\$}M{\_}*{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}10.5{\}}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}. In contrast, the O3N2-based MZR shows a constant offset of {\$}\backslashDelta\backslashrm log(\backslashrm O/H)\backslashsim0.30{\$} for all masses, consistent with previous MOSDEF results based on independent metallicity indicators, and suggesting that O3N2 provides a more robust metallicity calibration for our z{\~{}}1.5 sample. We investigated the secondary dependence of the MZR on SFR by measuring correlated scatter about the mean {\$}M{\_}*{\$}-sSFR and {\$}M{\_}*-\backslashlog(\backslashrm O3N2){\$} relations. We find an anti-correlation between {\$}\backslashlog(\backslashrm O/H){\$} and sSFR offsets, indicating the presence of a {\$}M{\_}*{\$}-SFR-Z relation, though with limited significance. Additionally, we find that our z{\~{}}1.5 stacks lie along the z=0 metallicity sequence at fixed {\$}\backslashmu=\backslashlog(M{\_}*/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}})-0.6\backslashtimes\backslashlog(\backslashrm SFR/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}yr{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}){\$}, suggesting that the z{\~{}}1.5 stacks can be described by the z=0 fundamental metallicity relation (FMR). However, using different calibrations can shift the metallicities enough to be inconsistent with the local FMR, indicating that the choice of calibration is essential for understanding metallicity evolution with redshift. Finally, understanding how [NII]/H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} scales with galaxy properties is crucial for describing the effects of blended [NII] and H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} on redshift and H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} flux measurements in future large surveys utilizing low-resolution spectra such as with Euclid and the Roman Space Telescope.},

abstract = {Massive quiescent galaxies (MQGs) are thought to have formed stars rapidly at early times followed by a long period of quiescence. The recent discovery of a MQG, ZF-COSMOS-20115 at {\$}z\backslashsim4{\$}, only 1.5 Gyr after the big bang, places new constraints on galaxy growth and the role of feedback in early star formation. Spectroscopic follow-up confirmed ZF-COSMOS-20115 as a MQG at {\$}z=3.717{\$} with an estimated stellar mass of {\$}{\{}\backslashsim{\}}10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}\backslashmathrm{\{}M{\}}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, showing no evidence of recent star formation. We use the Meraxes semi-analytic model to investigate how ZF-COSMOS-20115 analogues build stellar mass, and why they become quiescent. We identify three analogue galaxies with similar properties to ZF-COSMOS-20115. We find that ZF-COSMOS-20115 is likely hosted by a massive halo with virial mass of {\$}{\{}\backslashsim{\}}10{\^{}}{\{}13{\}}\backslashmathrm{\{}M{\}}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, having been through significant mergers at early times. These merger events drove intense growth of the nucleus, which later prevented cooling and quenched star formation. ZF-COSMOS-20115 likely remained quiescent at {\$}z{\textless}3.7{\$}. We find that the analogues host the most massive black holes in our simulation and were luminous quasars at {\$}z\backslashsim5{\$}, indicating that ZF-COSMOS-20115 and other MQGs may be the descendants of high-redshift quasars. In addition, the model suggests that ZF-COSMOS-20115 formed in a region of intergalactic medium that was reionized early.},

abstract = {The characteristic mass that sets the peak of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) is closely linked to the thermodynamic behaviour of interstellar gas, which controls how gas fragments as it collapses under gravity. As the Universe has grown in metal abundance over cosmic time, this thermodynamic behaviour has evolved from a primordial regime dominated by the competition between compressional heating and molecular hydrogen cooling to a modern regime where the dominant process in dense gas is protostellar radiation feedback, transmitted to the gas by dust–gas collisions. In this paper, we map out the primordial-to-modern transition by constructing a model for the thermodynamics of collapsing, dusty gas clouds at a wide range of metallicities. We show the transition from the primordial regime to the modern regime begins at metallicity {\$}Z\backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}-4{\}} \backslash,\backslashrm {\{}Z{\_}\backslashodot {\}}{\$}, passes through an intermediate stage where metal line cooling is dominant at {\$}Z \backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}\backslash, \backslashrm {\{}Z{\_}{\{}\backslashodot {\}}{\}}{\$}, and then transitions to the modern dust- and feedback-dominated regime at {\$}Z\backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}\backslash, \backslashrm {\{}Z{\_}\backslashodot {\}}{\$}. In low pressure environments like the Milky Way, this transition is accompanied by a dramatic change in the characteristic stellar mass, from {\$}{\{}\backslashsim{\}}50\backslash, \backslashrm {\{}M{\_}\backslashodot {\}}{\$} at {\$}Z \backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}-6{\}}\backslash, \backslashrm {\{}Z{\_}{\{}\backslashodot {\}}{\}}{\$} to {\$}{\{}\backslashsim{\}}0.3\backslash, \backslashrm {\{}M{\_}\backslashodot {\}}{\$} once radiation feedback begins to dominate, which marks the appearance of the modern bottom-heavy Milky Way IMF. In the high pressure environments typical of massive elliptical galaxies, the characteristic mass for the modern, dust-dominated regime falls to {\$}{\{}\backslashsim{\}}0.1\backslash, \backslashrm {\{}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot {\}}{\}}{\$}, thus providing an explanation for the more bottom-heavy IMF observed in these galaxies. We conclude that metallicity is a key driver of variations in the characteristic stellar mass, and by extension, the IMF.},

abstract = {We examine recent evidence from the luminosity-redshift relation of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) for the {\$}\backslashsim 3 \backslashsigma{\$} detection of a ``Hubble bubble'' -- a departure of the local value of the Hubble constant from its globally averaged value $\backslash$citep{\{}Jha:07{\}}. By comparing the MLCS2k2 fits used in that study to the results from other light-curve fitters applied to the same data, we demonstrate that this is related to the interpretation of SN color excesses (after correction for a light-curve shape-color relation) and the presence of a color gradient across the local sample. If the slope of the linear relation ({\$}\backslashbeta{\$}) between SN color excess and luminosity is fit empirically, then the bubble disappears. If, on the other hand, the color excess arises purely from Milky Way-like dust, then SN data clearly favors a Hubble bubble. We demonstrate that SN data give {\$}\backslashbeta \backslashsimeq 2{\$}, instead of the {\$}\backslashbeta \backslashsimeq 4{\$} one would expect from purely Milky-Way-like dust. This suggests that either SN intrinsic colors are more complicated than can be described with a single light-curve shape parameter, or that dust around SN is unusual. Disentangling these possibilities is both a challenge and an opportunity for large-survey SN Ia cosmology.},

abstract = {Obscured AGN represent a significant fraction of the entire AGN population, especially at high redshift ({\~{}}70{\%} at z=3--5). They are often characterized by the presence of large gas and dust reservoirs that are thought to sustain and possibly obscure vigorous star formation processes that make these objects shine at far-IR and sub-mm wavelengths. We exploit ALMA Cycle 4 observations of the continuum ({\~{}}2.1mm) and high-J CO emission of a sample of six X-ray selected SMGs hosting an obscured AGN at z{\_}spec{\textgreater}2.5 in the 7 Ms CDF-S. We measured the masses and sizes of the dust and molecular gas and we derived the gas density and column density on the basis of a uniform sphere geometry. Finally, we compared the measured column densities with those derived from the Chandra X-ray spectra. We detected both the continuum and line emission for three sources for which we measured both the flux density and size. For the undetected sources, we derived an upper limit on the flux density. We found that the detected galaxies are rich in gas and dust (molecular gas mass in the range {\textless}0.5 - 2.7 x 10{\^{}}10 M{\_}sun for {\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}{\_}CO=0.8 and up to {\~{}}2 x 10{\^{}}11{\~{}}M{\_}sun for {\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}{\_}CO=6.5, and dust mass {\textless}0.9 - 4.9 x 10{\^{}}8 M{\_}sun) and compact (gas major axis 2.1-3.0 kpc, dust major axis 1.4-2.7 kpc). The column densities associated with the ISM are on the order of 10{\^{}}(23-24) cm-2, which is comparable with those derived from the X-ray spectra. For the detected sources we also derived dynamical masses in the range 0.8 - 3.7 x 10{\^{}}10 M{\_}sun. We conclude that the ISM of high redshift galaxies can substantially contribute to nuclear obscuration up to the Compton-thick ({\textgreater}10{\^{}}24 cm-2) regime. In addition, we found that all the detected sources show a velocity gradient reminding one rotating system, even though two of them show peculiar features in their morphology that can be associated with a chaotic, possibly merging, structure.},

Combining ALMA [CII]158$\mu$m and far-infrared continuum data with multi-wavelength ancillary data, we find that the system is composed of two massive (M∗ 1010M{\textperiodcentered}) star-forming galaxies experiencing a major merger (stellar mass ratio rmass 0.9) at close spatial (∼13 kpc; projected) and velocity ($\Delta$v {\textless} 300kms-1) separations, and two additional faint narrow [CII]-emitting satellites. The overall system belongs to a larger scale protocluster environment and is coincident to one of its overdensity peaks. Additionally, ALMA reveals the presence of [CII] emission arising from a circumgalactic gas structure, extending up to a diameter-scale of ∼30 kpc. Our morpho-spectral decomposition analysis shows that about 50{\%} of the total flux resides between the individual galaxy components, in a metal-enriched gaseous envelope characterised by a disturbed morphology and complex kinematics. Similarly to observations of shock-excited [CII] emitted from tidal tails in local groups, our results can be interpreted as a possible signature of interstellar gas stripped by strong gravitational interactions, with a possible contribution from material ejected by galactic outflows and emission triggered by star formation in small faint satellites. Our findings suggest that mergers could be an efficient mechanism of gas mixing in the circumgalactic medium around high-z galaxies, and thus play a key role in the galaxy baryon cycle at early epochs.},

abstract = {Theoretical arguments and indirect observational evidence suggest that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) may evolve with time, such that it is more weighted toward high mass stars at higher redshift. Here we test this idea by comparing the rate of luminosity evolution of massive early-type galaxies in clusters at 0.02{\textless}z{\textless}0.83 to the rate of their color evolution. A combined fit to the rest-frame U-V color evolution and the previously measured evolution of the M/L{\_}B ratio gives x{\~{}}-0.3 for the logarithmic slope of the IMF in the region around 1 Solar mass, flatter than the present-day value in the Milky Way disk of x=1.3. The best-fitting luminosity-weighted formation redshift of the stars in massive cluster galaxies is {\~{}}3.7, and a possible interpretation is that the characteristic mass m{\_}c had a value of {\~{}}2 Solar masses at z{\~{}}4 (compared to m{\_}c{\~{}}0.1 Solar masses today), in qualitative agreement with models in which the characteristic mass is a function of the Jeans mass in molecular clouds. Such a ``bottom-light'' IMF for massive cluster galaxies has significant implications for the interpretation of measurements of galaxy formation and evolution. Applying a simple form of IMF evolution to literature data, we find that the volume-averaged star formation rate at high redshift may have been overestimated (by a factor of 3-4 at z{\textgreater}4), and the cosmic star formation history may have a fairly well-defined peak at z{\~{}}1.5. The M/L{\_}V ratios of galaxies are less affected than their star formation rates, and future data on the stellar mass density at z{\textgreater}3 will provide further constraints on IMF evolution. The formal errors likely underestimate the uncertainties, and confirmation of thes results requires a larger sample of clusters and the inclusion of redder rest-frame colors in the analysis.},

abstract = {Massive early-type galaxies represent the modern day remnants of the earliest major star formation episodes in the history of the universe. These galaxies are central to our understanding of the evolution of cosmic structure, stellar populations, and supermassive black holes, but the details of their complex formation histories remain uncertain. To address this situation, we have initiated the MASSIVE Survey, a volume-limited, multi-wavelength, integral-field spectroscopic (IFS) and photometric survey of the structure and dynamics of the {\~{}}100 most massive early-type galaxies within a distance of 108 Mpc. This survey probes a stellar mass range M* {\textgreater}{\~{}} 1011.5 M ⊙ and diverse galaxy environments that have not been systematically studied to date. Our wide-field IFS data cover about two effective radii of individual galaxies, and for a subset of them, we are acquiring additional IFS observations on sub-arcsecond scales with adaptive optics. We are also acquiring deep K-band imaging to trace the extended halos of the galaxies and measure accurate total magnitudes. Dynamical orbit modeling of the combined data will allow us to simultaneously determine the stellar, black hole, and dark matter halo masses. The primary goals of the project are to constrain the black hole scaling relations at high masses, investigate systematically the stellar initial mass function and dark matter distribution in massive galaxies, and probe the late-time assembly of ellipticals through stellar population and kinematical gradients. In this paper, we describe the MASSIVE sample selection, discuss the distinct demographics and structural and environmental properties of the selected galaxies, and provide an overview of our basic observational program, science goals and early survey results.},

abstract = {We investigate how "extra" or "excess" central light in the surface brightness profiles of cusp or power-law elliptical galaxies relates to the profiles of ellipticals with cores. The envelopes of cusp ellipticals are established by violent relaxation in mergers acting on stars present in gas-rich progenitor disks, while their centers are structured by the relics of dissipational, compact starbursts. Ellipticals with cores are formed by the subsequent merging of the now gas-poor cusp ellipticals, with the fossil starburst components combining to preserve a dense, compact component in these galaxies as well (although mixing of stars smooths the transition from the outer to inner components in the profiles). By comparing extensive hydrodynamical simulations to observed profiles spanning a broad mass range, we show how to observationally isolate and characterize the relic starburst component in core ellipticals. Our method recovers the younger starburst population, demonstrating that these dense concentrations survive spheroid-spheroid mergers and reflect the degree of dissipation in the initial mergers that formed the penultimate galaxy progenitors. The degree of dissipation in the mergers that produced the cusp ellipticals is a strong function of stellar mass, roughly tracing the observed gas fractions of disks of the same mass over redshifts z ∼ 0-2. The strength of this component strongly correlates with effective radius at fixed mass: systems with more dissipation are more compact, sufficient to explain the discrepancy in the maximum phase-space densities of ellipticals and their progenitor spirals. The survival of this component together with scattering of stars into the envelope in remergers naturally explain the high-Sersic index profile shapes characteristic of very massive core ellipticals. This is also closely related to the kinematics and isophotal shapes: only systems with matched starburst components from their profile fits also reproduce the observed kinematics of boxy/core ellipticals. The final "core-scouring" phase of core formation occurs when a black hole binary formed in the merger scatters stars out of the innermost regions of the extra-light component. It is therefore critical to adopt a physically motivated profile decomposition that accounts for the fossil starburst component when attempting to quantify scouring. We show that estimates of the scoured mass that employ single-component forms fitted to the entire galaxy profile can be strongly biased. {\textcopyright} 2009. The American Astronomical Society.

We study galaxy radial profiles in $\Delta$$\Sigma$SFR, and luminosity weighted stellar age (AgeL), split by a variety of intrinsic and environmental parameters. Via several statistical analyses, we establish that the quenching of central galaxies is governed by intrinsic parameters, with central velocity dispersion ($\sigma$c) being the most important single parameter. High mass satellites quench in a very similar manner to centrals. Conversely, low mass satellite quenching is governed primarily by environmental parameters, with local galaxy overdensity ($\delta$5) being the most important single parameter. Utilizing the empirical MBH − $\sigma$c relation, we estimate that quenching via AGN feedback must occur at {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm BH{\}} \backslashge 10{\^{}}{\{}6.5-7.5{\}} \backslash, \backslashmathrm{\{}M{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot {\}}{\$}, and is marked by steeply rising $\Delta$$\Sigma$SFR radial profiles in the green valley, indicating ‘inside-out' quenching. On the other hand, environmental quenching occurs at overdensities of 10–30 times the average galaxy density at z∼ 0.1, and is marked by steeply declining $\Delta$$\Sigma$SFR profiles, indicating ‘outside-in' quenching. Finally, through an analysis of stellar metallicities, we conclude that both intrinsic and environmental quenching must incorporate significant starvation of gas supply.},

abstract = {Winds accelerated by active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are invoked in the most successful models of galaxy evolution to explain the observed physical and evolutionary properties of massive galaxies. Winds are expected to deposit energy and momentum into the interstellar medium (ISM), thus regulating both star formation and supermassive black hole (SMBH) growth. We undertook a multiband observing program aimed at obtaining a complete census of winds in a sample of WISE/SDSS selected hyper-luminous (WISSH) quasars (QSOs) at z 2-4. We analyzed the rest-frame optical (i.e. LBT/LUCI and VLT/SINFONI) and UV (i.e. SDSS) spectra of 18 randomly selected WISSH QSOs to measure the SMBH mass and study the properties of winds both in the narrow line region (NLR) and broad line region (BLR) traced by blueshifted or skewed [OIII] and CIV emission lines, respectively. These WISSH QSOs are powered by SMBH with masses 109 M{\textperiodcentered} accreting at 0.4 {\textless} $\lambda$Edd {\textless} 3.1. We found the existence of two subpopulations of hyper-luminous QSOs characterized by the presence of outflows at different distances from the SMBH. One population (i.e. [OIII] sources) exhibits powerful [OIII] outflows, a rest-frame equivalent width (REW) of the CIV emission REWCIV 20-40 {\AA}, and modest CIV velocity shift (vCIVpeak) with respect to the systemic redshift (vCIVpeak {\textless}∼ 2000 km s-1). The second population (i.e. Weak [OIII] sources), representing ∼70{\%} of the analyzed WISSH QSOs, shows weak or absent [OIII] emission and an extremely large blueshifted CIV emission (vCIVpeak up to ∼8000 km s-1 and REWCIV {\textless}∼ 20 {\AA}). We propose two explanations for the observed behavior of the strength of the [OIII] emission in terms of the orientation effects of the line of sight and ionization cone. The dichotomy in the presence of BLR and NLR winds could be likely due to inclination effects considering a polar geometry scenario for the BLR winds. In a few cases these winds are remarkably as powerful as those revealed in the NLR in the [OIII] QSOs (- kin ∼ 1044-45 erg s-1). We also investigated the dependence of these CIV winds on fundamental AGN parameters such as bolometric luminosity (LBol), Eddington ratio ($\lambda$Edd), and UV-to-X-ray continuum slope ($\alpha$OX). We found a strong correlation with LBol and an anti-correlation with $\alpha$OX whereby the higher the luminosity, the steeper the ionizing continuum described by means of $\alpha$OX and the larger the blueshift of the CIV emission line. Finally, the observed dependence vCIVpeak LBol0.28 ± 0.04 is consistent with a radiatively-driven-winds scenario, where a strong UV continuum is necessary to launch the wind and a weakness of the X-rayemission is fundamental to prevent overionization of the wind itself.},

abstract = {Growing observational evidence now indicates that nebular line emission has a significant impact on the rest-frame optical fluxes of z{\~{}}5-7 galaxies observed with Spitzer. This line emission makes z{\~{}}5-7 galaxies appear more massive, with lower specific star formation rates. However, corrections for this line emission have been very difficult to perform reliably due to huge uncertainties on the overall strength of such emission at z{\textgreater}{\~{}}5.5. Here, we present the most direct observational evidence yet for ubiquitous high-EW [OIII]+Hbeta line emission in Lyman-break galaxies at z{\~{}}7, while also presenting a strategy for an improved measurement of the sSFR at z{\~{}}7. We accomplish this through the selection of bright galaxies in the narrow redshift window z{\~{}}6.6-7.0 where the IRAC 4.5 micron flux provides a clean measurement of the stellar continuum light. Observed 4.5 micron fluxes in this window contrast with the 3.6 micron fluxes which are contaminated by the prominent [OIII]+Hbeta lines. To ensure a high S/N for our IRAC flux measurements, we consider only the brightest (H{\_}{\{}160{\}}{\textless}26 mag) magnified galaxies we have identified in CLASH and other programs targeting galaxy clusters. Remarkably, the mean rest-frame optical color for our bright seven-source sample is very blue, [3.6]-[4.5]=-0.9+/-0.3. Such blue colors cannot be explained by the stellar continuum light and require that the rest-frame EW of [OIII]+Hbeta be greater than 637 Angstroms for the average source. The bluest four sources from our seven-source sample require an even more extreme EW of 1582 Angstroms. Our derived lower limit for the mean [OIII]+Hbeta EW could underestimate the true EW by {\~{}}2x based on a simple modeling of the redshift distribution of our sources. We can also set a robust lower limit of {\textgreater}{\~{}}4 Gyr{\^{}}-1 on the specific star formation rates based on the mean SED for our seven-source sample. (abridged)},

J1316+2614 is a young (≃10 Myr) star-forming galaxy with SFR ≃ 500 M⊙ yr−1 and a starburst mass of log(M⋆/M⊙) ≃ 9.7. It shows a very steep UV continuum, $\beta$UV = −2.59 ± 0.05, consistent with residual dust obscuration, E(B − V) ≃ 0. LyC emission is detected with high significance (≃17$\sigma$) down to 830 {\AA}, for which a very high relative (absolute) LyC escape fraction {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashrm esc{\}} \backslashrm (LyC) \backslashsimeq 0.92{\$} (≃0.87) is inferred. The contribution of a foreground or active galactic nucleus contamination to the LyC signal is discussed, but is unlikely. J1316+2614 is the most powerful ionizing source known among the star-forming galaxy population, both in terms of production (QH ≈ 1056 s−1) and escape of ionizing photons ({\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashrm esc{\}} \backslashrm (LyC) \backslashapprox 0.9{\$}). Nebular emission in Ly $\alpha$, H $\beta$, and other rest-frame optical lines are detected, but these are weak ({\$}EW{\_}{\{}0{\}} \backslashrm [H\backslashbeta ] \backslashsimeq 35{\$} {\AA}), with their strengths reduced roughly by {\$}\backslashsimeq 90{\{}{\{}\backslash \backslashrm per\backslash cent{\}}{\}}{\$}. J1316+2614 is the first case known where the effect of large escape of ionizing photons on the strength of nebular lines and continuum emission is clearly observed. Gas inflows are detected in J1316+2614 from the blue-dominated peak Ly $\alpha$ emission (with a blue-to-red peak line ratio Iblue/Ired ≃ 3.7) and redshifted interstellar medium absorption (≃100 km s−1). Our results suggest that J1316+2614 is undergoing a gas compaction event, possibly representing a short-lived phase in the evolution of massive and compact galaxies, where strong gas inflows have triggered an extreme star formation episode and nearly 100 per cent LyC photons are escaping.},

This deficit results from the systematic difficulty of SExtractor in finding faint galaxies in regions with higher-than-average surface densities of foreground galaxies. We corrected our stacked magnitudes for this. Best-fit stellar population templates for the stacked LBG SEDs indicate stellar masses and star-formation rates of log M*/Msun = 10 and 50 M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}/yr at i' = 24, down to log M*/Msun = 8 and = 3 M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}/yr at i' = 27. For the faint stacked LBGs there is a 1-mag excess over the expected stellar continuum in the K-band, which we attribute to redshifted [OIII]4959+5007 and H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} lines. Their implied equivalent widths increase with decreasing mass, reaching {\$}\backslashrm{\{}EW{\_}0([O III]4959,5007+H\backslashbeta){\}}{\$} =1500A in the faintest bin. Such strong [OIII] emission is seen only in a miniscule fraction of the most extreme local emission-line galaxies, but it probably universal in the faint galaxies that reionized the universe. Finally, we analyze clustering by computing the angular correlation function and performing halo occupation distribution (HOD) analysis. We find a mean dark halo mass of log(Mhalo/h) Msun = 11.29{\$}\backslashpm 0.12{\$} for the full sample of LBGs, and log(Mhalo/h) Msun = 11.49{\$}\backslashpm 0.1{\$} for the brightest half.},

abstract = {At redshift z = 2, when the Universe was just three billion years old, half of the most massive galaxies were extremely compact and had already exhausted their fuel for star formation. It is believed that they were formed in intense nuclear starbursts and that they ultimately grew into the most massive local elliptical galaxies seen today, through mergers with minor companions, but validating this picture requires higher-resolution observations of their centres than is currently possible. Magnification from gravitational lensing offers an opportunity to resolve the inner regions of galaxies. Here we report an analysis of the stellar populations and kinematics of a lensed z = 2.1478 compact galaxy, which - surprisingly - turns out to be a fast-spinning, rotationally supported disk galaxy. Its stars must have formed in a disk, rather than in a merger-driven nuclear starburst. The galaxy was probably fed by streams of cold gas, which were able to penetrate the hot halo gas until they were cut off by shock heating from the dark matter halo. This result confirms previous indirect indications that the first galaxies to cease star formation must have gone through major changes not just in their structure, but also in their kinematics, to evolve into present-day elliptical galaxies.},

abstract = {The kinematic morphology-density relation of galaxies is normally attributed to a changing distribution of galaxy stellar masses with the local environment. However, earlier studies were largely focused on slow rotators; the dynamical properties of the overall population in relation to environment have received less attention. We use the SAMI Galaxy Survey to investigate the dynamical properties of ∼1800 early and late-type galaxies with log (M⊙/M⊙) {\textgreater} 9.5 as a function of mean environmental overdensity ($\Sigma$5) and their rank within a group or cluster. By classifying galaxies into fast and slow rotators, at fixed stellar mass above log (M⊙/M⊙) {\textgreater} 10.5, we detect a higher fraction (∼3.4$\sigma$) of slow rotators for group and cluster centrals and satellites as compared to isolated-central galaxies. We find similar results when using $\Sigma$5 as a tracer for environment. Focusing on the fast-rotator population, we also detect a significant correlation between galaxy kinematics and their stellar mass as well as the environment they are in. Specifically, by using inclination-corrected or intrinsic $\lambda$Re values, we find that, at fixed mass, satellite galaxies on average have the lowest $\lambda$Re, intr, isolated-central galaxies have the highest $\lambda$Re, intr, and group and cluster centrals lie in between. Similarly, galaxies in high-density environments have lower mean $\lambda$Re,intr values as compared to galaxies at low environmental density. However, at fixed $\Sigma$5, the mean $\lambda$Re, intr differences for low and high-mass galaxies are of similar magnitude as when varying $\Sigma$5 ($\Delta$ $\lambda$Re,intr ∼ 0.05, with $\sigma$random = 0.025, and $\sigma$syst {\textless} 0.03). Our results demonstrate that after stellar mass, environment plays a significant role in the creation of slow rotators, while for fast rotators we also detect an independent, albeit smaller, impact of mass and environment on their kinematic properties.},

abstract = {We present a new, publicly available library of dust spectral energy distributions (SEDs). These SEDs are characterized by only three parameters: the dust mass (Mdust), the dust temperature (Tdust), and the mid-to-total infrared color (IR8 ≡ LIR/L8). The latter measures the relative contribution of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules to the total infrared luminosity. We used this library to model star-forming galaxies at 0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 4 in the deep CANDELS fields, using both individual detections and stacks of Herschel and ALMA imaging, and extending this sample to z = 0 using the Herschel Reference Survey. At first order, the dust SED of a galaxy was observed to be independent of stellar mass, but evolving with redshift. We found trends of increasing Tdust and IR8 with redshift and distance from the SFR-M main sequence, and quantified for the first time their intrinsic scatter. Half of the observed variations of these parameters was captured by the above empirical relations, and after subtracting the measurement errors we found residual scatters of $\Delta$Tdust/Tdust = 12{\%} and $\Delta$log IR8 = 0.18 dex. We observed second order variations with stellar mass: massive galaxies (M∗ {\textgreater} 1011 M⊙) at z ≤ 1 have slightly lower temperatures indicative of a reduced star formation efficiency, while low mass galaxies (M∗ {\textless} 1010 M⊙) at z ≥ 1 showed reduced PAH emission, possibly linked to their lower metallicities. Building on these results, we constructed high-fidelity mock galaxy catalogs to predict the accuracy of infrared luminosities and dust masses determined using a single broadband measurement. Using a single James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) MIRI band, we found that LIR is typically uncertain by 0.15 dex, with a maximum of 0.25 dex when probing the rest-frame 8 $\mu$m, and this is not significantly impacted by typical redshift uncertainties. On the other hand, we found that ALMA bands 8 to 7 and 6 to 3 measured the dust mass at better than 0.2 and 0.15 dex, respectively, and independently of redshift, while bands 9 to 6 only measured LIR at better than 0.2 dex at z {\textgreater} 1, 3.2, 3.8, and 5.7, respectively. Starburst galaxies had their LIR significantly underestimated when measured by a single JWST or ALMA band, while their dust mass from a single ALMA band were moderately overestimated. This dust library and the results of this paper can be used immediately to improve the design of observing proposals, and interpret more accurately the large amount of archival data from Spitzer, Herschel and ALMA.},

abstract = {In providing an independent measure of the expansion history of the universe, the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) has observed 71 high-z Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) in the near-infrared bands Y and J. These can be used to construct rest-frame i-band light curves which, when compared to a low-z sample, yield distance moduli that are less sensitive to extinction and/or decline-rate corrections than in the optical. However, working with NIR observed and i-band rest-frame photometry presents unique challenges and has necessitated the development of a new set of observational tools in order to reduce and analyze both the low-z and high-z CSP sample. We present in this paper the methods used to generate uBVgriYJH light-curve templates based on a sample of 24 high-quality low-z CSP SNe. We also present two methods for determining the distances to the hosts of SN Ia events. A larger sample of 30 low-z SNe Ia in the Hubble flow is used to calibrate these methods. We then apply the method and derive distances to seven galaxies that are so nearby that their motions are not dominated by the Hubble flow.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of a Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) galaxy group at z=4.32 lensed by the massive galaxy cluster ACT-CL J0102-4915 (aka El Gordo) at z=0.87, associated with a 1.2 mm source which is at a 2.07+/-0.88 kpc projected distance from one of the group galaxies. Three images of the whole system appear in the image plane. The 1.2 mm source has been detected within the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) Lensing Cluster Survey (ALCS). As this ALMA source is undetected at wavelengths lambda {\textless} 2 microns, its redshift cannot be independently determined, however, the three lensing components indicate that it belongs to the same galaxy group at z=4.32. The four members of the MUSE galaxy group have low to intermediate stellar masses ({\~{}} 10{\^{}}7-10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}} Msun) and star formation rates (SFRs) of 0.4-24 Msun/yr, resulting in high specific SFRs (sSFRs) for two of them, which suggest that these galaxies are growing fast (with stellar-mass doubling times of only {\~{}} 2x10{\^{}}7 years). This high incidence of starburst galaxies is likely a consequence of interactions within the galaxy group, which is compact and has high velocity dispersion. Based on the magnification-corrected sub-/millimetre continuum flux density and estimated stellar mass, we infer that the ALMA source is classified as an ordinary ultra-luminous infrared galaxy (with associated dust-obscured SFR{\~{}}200-300 Msun/yr) and lies on the star-formation main sequence. This reported case of an ALMA/MUSE group association suggests that some presumably isolated ALMA sources are in fact signposts of richer star-forming environments at high redshifts.},

abstract = {We combine new Spitzer Space Telescope observations in the mid- and far-infrared with SCUBA 850 micron observations to improve the measurement of dust temperatures, masses and luminosities for 11 galaxies of the SCUBA Local Universe Galaxy Survey (SLUGS). By fitting dust models we measure typical dust masses of 10E7.9 M{\_}sol and dust luminosities of {\~{}} 10E10 L{\_}sol, for galaxies with modest star formation rates. The data presented in this paper combined with previous observations show that cold dust is present in all types of spiral galaxies and is a major contributor to their total luminosity. Because of the lower dust temperature of the SCUBA sources measured in this paper, they have flatter Far-IR nu F{\_}nu(160um)/nu F{\_}nu(850um) slopes than the larger Spitzer Nearby Galaxies Survey (SINGS), the sample that provides the best measurements of the dust properties of galaxies in the nearby universe. The new data presented here added to SINGS extend the parameter space that is well covered by local galaxies, providing a comprehensive set of templates that can be used to interpret the observations of nearby and distant galaxies.},

abstract = {We study the stellar mass functions (SMFs) of star-forming and quiescent galaxies in 11 galaxy clusters at 1.0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.4 drawn from the Gemini Observations of Galaxies in Rich Early ENvironments (GOGREEN) survey. Based on more than 500 h of Gemini/GMOS spectroscopy and deep multi-band photometry taken with a range of observatories, we probe the SMFs down to a stellar mass limit of 10 9.7 M ⊙ (10 9.5 M ⊙ for star-forming galaxies). At this early epoch, the fraction of quiescent galaxies is already highly elevated in the clusters compared to the field at the same redshift. The quenched fraction excess (QFE) represents the fraction of galaxies that would be star-forming in the field but are quenched due to their environment. The QFE is strongly mass dependent, and increases from ∼30{\%} at M ⋆ = 10 9.7 M ⊙ to ∼80{\%} at M ⋆ = 10 11.0 M ⊙ . Nonetheless, the shapes of the SMFs of the two individual galaxy types, star-forming and quiescent galaxies, are identical between cluster and field to high statistical precision. Nevertheless, along with the different quiescent fractions, the total galaxy SMF is also environmentally dependent, with a relative deficit of low-mass galaxies in the clusters. These results are in stark contrast with findings in the local Universe, and therefore require a substantially different quenching mode to operate at early times. We discuss these results in light of several popular quenching models.},

abstract = {A key obstacle to understanding the galaxy merger rate and its role in galaxy evolution is the difficulty in constraining the merger properties and time-scales from instantaneous snapshots of the real universe.The most common way to identify galaxy mergers is by morphology, yet current theoretical calculations of the time-scales for galaxy disturbances are quite crude. We present a morphological analysis of a large suite of GADGET N-Body/hydro-dynamical equal-mass gas-rich disc galaxy mergers which have been processed through the Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code SUNRISE. With the resulting images, we examine the dependence of quantitative morphology (G, M20, C, A) in the SDSS g-band on merger stage, dust, viewing angle, orbital parameters, gas properties, supernova feedback, and total mass. We find that mergers appear most disturbed in G-M20 and asymmetry at the first pass and at the final coalescence of their nuclei, but can have normal quantitative morphologies at other merger stages. The merger observability time-scales depend on the method used to identify the merger as well as the gas fraction, pericentric distance, and relative orientation of the merging galaxies. Enhanced star formation peaks after and lasts significantly longer than strong morphological disturbances. Despite their massive bulges, the majority of merger remnants appear disc-like and dusty in g-band light because of the presence of a low-mass star-forming disc.},

abstract = {In this letter a late-phase spectrum of SN 2010lp, a subluminous Type Ia supernova (SN Ia), is presented and analysed. As in 1991bg-like SNe Ia at comparable epochs, the spectrum is characterised by relatively broad [FeII] and [CaII] emission lines. However, instead of narrow [FeIII] and [CoIII] lines that dominate the emission from the innermost regions of 1991bg-like SNe, SN 2010lp shows [OI] 6300,6364 emission, usually associated with core-collapse SNe and never observed in a subluminous thermonuclear explosion before. The [OI] feature has a complex profile with two strong, narrow emission peaks. This suggests oxygen to be distributed in a non-spherical region close to the centre of the ejecta, severely challenging most thermonuclear explosion models discussed in the literature. We conclude that given these constraints violent mergers are presently the most promising scenario to explain SN 2010lp.},

abstract = {Using the Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 imaging data and multi-wavelength photometric catalog, we investigated the dust temperature of passively evolving and star-forming galaxies at 0.2{\textless}z{\textless}1.0 in the CANDELS fields. We estimated the stellar radiation field by low-mass stars from the stellar mass and surface brightness profile of these galaxies and then calculated their steady-state dust temperature. At first, we tested our method using nearby early-type galaxies with the deep FIR data by the Herschel Virgo cluster survey and confirmed that the estimated dust temperatures are consistent with the observed temperatures within the uncertainty. We then applied the method to galaxies at 0.2{\textless}z{\textless}1.0, and found that most of passively evolving galaxies with Mstar {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}} Msun have a relatively high dust temperature of Tdust {\textgreater} 20 K, for which the formation efficiency of molecular hydrogen on the surface of dust grains in the diffuse ISM is expected to be very low from the laboratory experiments. The fraction of passively evolving galaxies strongly depends on the expected dust temperature at all redshifts and increases rapidly with increasing the temperature around Tdust {\~{}} 20 K. These results suggest that the dust heating by low-mass stars in massive galaxies plays an important role for the continuation of their passive evolution, because the lack of the shielding effect of the molecular hydrogen on the UV radiation can prevent the gas cooling and formation of new stars.},

CR7 is a luminous Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emitting galaxy at {\$}z=6.6{\$} that consists of three separated UV-continuum components.

We quantify colours with {\$}u{\^{}}{\{}*{\}}-r{\^{}}{\{}*{\}}{\$} intrinsic magnitudes and morphologies with a measure of the stellar kinematics. The time when galaxies moved onto the red sequence depends on their morphology. Disc-type galaxies tend to have become red during the last 3 Gyr, while elliptical-type galaxies joined the red sequence earlier, with half the sample already being red 5 Gyr ago. The time-scale, {\$}\backslashtau{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}Green{\}}{\}}{\$}, of colour transition through the `green valley' depends weakly on the galaxy's morphological type. Elliptical-type galaxies cross the green valley slightly faster ({\$}\backslashtau{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}Green{\}}{\}}{\{}\backslashapprox{\}}1{\$} Gyr) than disc-type galaxies ({\$}\backslashtau{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}Green{\}}{\}}{\{}\backslashapprox{\}}{\$}1.5 Gyr). While {\$}\backslashtau{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}Green{\}}{\}}{\$} is similar for central and satellite galaxies, for satellites {\$}\backslashtau{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}Green{\}}{\}}{\$} decreases with increasing stellar mass to host-halo mass ratio. Coupled with our finding that galaxies tend to become green after becoming satellites, this indicates that satellite-specific processes are important for quenching red-sequence galaxies. The last time central, elliptical-type red-sequence galaxies left the blue cloud is strongly correlated with the time the luminosity of the central black hole peaked, but this is not the case for discs. This suggests that AGN feedback is important for quenching ellipticals, particularly centrals, but not for discs. We find only a weak connection between transformations in colour and morphology.},

Using a sample of 1630 optical spectra of 255 SNe, based primarily on data from the CfA Supernova Program, we examine how the velocity evolution and line strengths of Si II 6355 and Ca II H{\&}K are related to the B-V color at peak brightness. We find that the maximum-light velocity of Si II 6355 and Ca II H{\&}K and the maximum-light pseudo-equivalent width of Si II 6355 are correlated with intrinsic color, with intrinsic color having a linear relation with the Si II 6355 measurements. Ca II H{\&}K does not have a linear relation with intrinsic color, but lower-velocity SNe tend to be intrinsically bluer. Combining the spectroscopic measurements does not improve intrinsic color inference. The intrinsic color scatter is larger for higher-velocity SNe Ia --- even after removing a linear trend with velocity --- indicating that lower-velocity SNe Ia are more "standard crayons." Employing information derived from SN Ia spectra has the potential to improve the measurements of extragalactic distances and the cosmological properties inferred from them.},

In this paper, we present the analysis of a sample of five Dusty Star Forming Galaxies (DSFGs) at {\$}4 \backslashlesssim z\backslashlesssim 5{\$}. Taking advantage of the magnifying power of strong gravitational lensing, we quantified their kinematic and dynamical properties from ALMA observations of their [CII] emission line. We combined the dynamical measurements obtained for these galaxies with those obtained from previous studies to build the largest sample of {\$}z \backslashsim 4.5{\$} galaxies with high-quality data and sub-kpc spatial resolutions, so far. We found that all galaxies in the sample are dynamically cold, with rotation-to-random motion ratios, {\$}V/\backslashsigma{\$}, between 7 to 15. The relation between their velocity dispersions and their star-formation rates indicates that stellar feedback is sufficient to sustain the turbulence within these galaxies and no further mechanisms are needed. In addition, we performed a rotation curve decomposition to infer the relative contribution of the baryonic (gas, stars) and dark matter components to the total gravitational potentials. This analysis allowed us to compare the structural properties of the studied DSFGs with those of their descendants, the local early type galaxies. In particular, we found that five out of six galaxies of the sample show the dynamical signature of a bulge, indicating that the spheroidal component is already in place at {\$}z \backslashsim 4.5{\$}.},

abstract = {Inspired by our serendipitous discovery of six AGNs with varying broad-Halpha fluxes over years out of our searching for intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs), we conduct a systematic investigation of changing-look (CL) and large-variability AGNs. We collect all the CL AGNs at z{\textless}0.15 and the reverberation mapped AGNs with strongly variable broad Halpha, and perform careful decomposition fittings to both their images and spectra. We find two observational facts: (1) The host galaxies of local CL and large-variability AGNs, mainly being Seyferts, are in the red (gas-poor) tail of the general Seyfert galaxy population. (2) In contrast, there is a significant trend that their more luminous counterparts namely CL and extremely variable quasars (CLQs and EVQs) are different: CLQs are generally in blue galaxies; in terms of the diagram of SFR and M* local CL Seyfert galaxies are located in the green valley, whereas CLQ hosts are in the star-forming main sequence. We propose explanations for those strongly variable Seyferts and quasars, respectively, under the thought that accretion disks broadly depend on nuclear fueling modes. Local large-variability and CL Seyferts are in nuclear famine mode, where cold-gas clumps can be formed stochastically in the fueling flow, and their episodic infall produces sharp peaks in the accretion-rate curve. CLQs and EVQs are in feast fueling mode, which may account for both their preference to blue galaxies and their variability pattern (high-amplitude tail of the continuous distribution). Lastly, we propose a new thinking: to search for IMBHs by optical variability in red galaxies.},

Using multiple spectral lines detected in JWST/NIRSpec, the rest-frame optical to infrared images from NIRCam and MIRI, and far-infrared (FIR) dust continuum detected by ALMA, we argue that the newly discovered sources are actually lensed images of the same companion galaxy, hereafter referred to as SPT0418-SE ("SE"), located within 5 kpc in the source plane of the ring. The star formation rate derived using [C II] and dust continuum puts a lower limit of 17 M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}/yr, while the SFR{\$}{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}H\backslashalpha{\}}{\$} is estimated to be {\$}\backslashsim{\$}200 times lower, thereby confirming that SE is a heavily dust obscured star-forming galaxy. Analysis using optical strong line diagnostics suggests that SE has near solar elemental abundance, while the ring appears to have super-solar metallicity O/H and N/O. We attempt to reconcile the high metallicity in this system by invoking early onset of star formation with continuous high star forming efficiency, or that optical strong line diagnostics need revision at high redshift. We suggest that SPT0418-47 resides in a massive dark matter halo with yet to be discovered neighbors. This work highlights the importance of joint analysis of JWST and ALMA data for a deep and complete picture of the early Universe.},

abstract = {Recent independent results from numerical simulations and observations have shown that brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) have increased their stellar mass by a factor of almost two between z{\~{}}0.9 and z{\~{}}0.2. The numerical simulations further suggest that more than half this mass is accreted through major mergers. Using a sample of 18 distant galaxy clusters with over 600 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members between them, we search for observational evidence that major mergers do play a significant role. We find a major merger rate of 0.38 +/- 0.14 mergers per Gyr at z{\~{}}1. While the uncertainties, which stem from the small size of our sample, are relatively large, our rate is consistent with the results that are derived from numerical simulations. If we assume that this rate continues to the present day and that half of the mass of the companion is accreted onto the BCG during these mergers, then we find that this rate can explain the growth in the stellar mass of the BCGs that is observed and predicted by simulations. Major mergers therefore appear to be playing an important role, perhaps even the dominant one, in the build up of stellar mass in these extraordinary galaxies.},

abstract = {A six-dimensional parameter space based on high-resolution numerical simulations of isolated binary galaxy collisions has been constructed to investigate the dynamical friction timescales, $\tau$mer, for major mergers. Our experiments follow the gravitational encounters between ∼600 pairs of similarly massive late- and early-type galaxies with orbital parameters that meet the predictions of the $\Lambda$-cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology. We analyse the performance of different schemes for tracking the secular evolution of mergers, finding that the product of the intergalactic distance and velocity is best suited to identify the time of coalescence. In contrast, a widely used merger-time estimator such as the exhaustion of the orbital spin is shown to systematically underpredict $\tau$mer, resulting in relative errors that can reach 60{\%} for nearly radial encounters. We find that the internal spins of the progenitors can lead to total variations in the merger times larger than 30{\%} in highly circular encounters, whereas only the spin of the principal halo is capable of modulating the strength of the interaction prevailing throughout a merger. The comparison of our simulated merger times with predictions from different variants of a well-known fitting formula has revealed an only partially satisfactory agreement, which has led us to recalculate the values of the coefficients of these expressions to obtain relations that fit major mergers perfectly. The observed biases between data and predictions, which do not only apply to the present work, are inconsistent with expectations from differences in the degree of idealisation of the collisions, their metric, spin-related biases, or the simulation set-up. This indicates a certain lack of accuracy of the dynamical friction modelling, arising perhaps from a still incomplete identification of the parameters governing orbital decay.},

Good progress has been made in charting the end of reionization through spectroscopic studies of z{\~{}}6-8 QSOs, gamma-ray bursts and galaxies expected to host Lyman-alpha emission. However, the most stringent constraints on its duration have come from the integrated optical depth, tau, of Thomson scattering to the cosmic microwave background. Using the latest data on the abundance and luminosity distribution of distant galaxies from Hubble Space Telescope imaging, we simultaneously match the reduced value tau=0.066 +/- 0.012 recently reported by the Planck collaboration and the evolving neutrality of the intergalactic medium with a reionization history within 6 {\textless}{\~{}} z {\textless}{\~{}} 10, thereby reducing the requirement for a significant population of very high redshift (z{\textgreater}{\textgreater}10) galaxies.

abstract = {Analyses of strong gravitational lenses, galaxy-scale kinematics, and absorption line stellar population synthesis (SPS) have all concluded that the stellar initial mass function (IMF) varies within the massive early-type galaxy (ETG) population. However, the physical mechanism that drives variation in the IMF is an outstanding question. Here we use new SPS models to consider a diverse set of compact, low-velocity dispersion stellar systems: globular clusters (GCs), an ultra-compact dwarf (UCD), and the compact elliptical (cE) galaxy M32. We compare our results to massive ETGs and available dynamical measurements. We find that the GCs have stellar mass-to-light ratios (M/L) that are either consistent with a Kroupa IMF or are slightly bottom-light while the UCD and cE have mildly elevated M/L. The separation in derived IMFs for systems with similar metallicities and abundance patterns indicates that our SPS models can distinguish abundance and IMF effects. Variation among the sample in this paper is only {\$}\backslashsim 50\backslash{\%}{\$} in normalized M/L compared to the {\$}\backslashsim 4\backslashtimes{\$} among the ETG sample. This suggests that metallicity is not the sole driver of IMF variability and additional parameters need to be considered.},

abstract = {In this letter, we investigate the impact of environment on integrated and spatially-resolved stellar kinematics of a sample of massive, quiescent galaxies at intermediate redshift (0.6 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.0). For this analysis, we combine photometric and spectroscopic parameters from the UltraVISTA and Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) surveys in the COSMOS field and environmental measurements. We analyze the trends with overdensity (1+$\delta$) on the rotational support of quiescent galaxies and find no universal trends at either fixed mass or fixed stellar velocity dispersion. This is consistent with previous studies of the local Universe; rotational support of massive galaxies depends primarily on stellar mass. We highlight two populations of massive galaxies (log M?/M☉ ≥ 11) that deviate from the average mass relation. First, the most massive galaxies in the most under-dense regions ((1+$\delta$) ≤ 1) exhibit elevated rotational support. Similarly, at the highest masses (log M?/M☉ ≥ 11.25) the range in rotational support is significant in all but the densest regions. This corresponds to an increasing slow-rotator fraction such that only galaxies in the densest environments ((1 + $\delta$) ≥ 3.5) are primarily (90±10{\%}) slow-rotators.This effect is not seen at fixed velocity dispersion, suggesting minor merging as the driving mechanism: only in the densest regions have the most massive galaxies experienced significant minor merging, building stellar mass and diminishing rotation without significantly affecting the central stellar velocity dispersion. In the local Universe, most massive galaxies are slow-rotators, regardless of environment, suggesting minor merging occurs at later cosmic times (z. 0.6) in all but the most dense environments.},

abstract = {Observations show that galaxies follow a mass-metallicity relation over a wide range of masses. One currently favoured explanation is that less massive galaxies are less able to retain the gas and stellar ejecta and thus may lose the freshly produced metals in the form of galactic outflows. Galaxies with a low current star formation rate have been found to contain star clusters up to a lower mass limit. Since stars are predominately born in clusters, and less massive clusters have been found to be less likely to contain very massive stars, this implies that in environments or at times of low star formation, the stellar initial mass function does not extend to as high masses as during high star formation epochs. It is found that the oxygen yield is reduced by a factor of 30 when the star formation rate is decreased by 3 to 4 orders of magnitude. With this concept, chemical evolution models for galaxies of a range of masses are computed and shown to provide an excellent fit to the mass-metallicity relation derived recently by Tremonti et al. Furthermore, the models match the relation between galaxy mass and effective yield. Thus, the scenario of a variable integrated stellar initial mass function, which is based on the concept of formation of stars in clusters, may offer an attractive alternative or partial explanation of the mass-metallicity relation in galaxies. {\textcopyright} 2007 RAS.},

abstract = {We make an in-depth comparison of the IllustrisTNG cosmological simulations with observed quenched fractions of central and satellite galaxies, for Mstars = 109–12 M⊙ at 0 ≤ z ≤ 3. We show how measurement choices [aperture, quenched definition, and star formation rate (SFR) indicator time-scale], as well as sample selection issues (projection effects, satellite/central misclassification, and host mass distribution sampling), impact this comparison. The quenched definition produces differences of up to 70 (30) percentage points for centrals (satellites) above ∼1010.5 M⊙. At z ≳ 2, a larger aperture within which SFR is measured suppresses the quenched fractions by up to ∼50 percentage points. Proper consideration of the stellar and host mass distributions is crucial: Naive comparisons to volume-limited samples from simulations lead to misinterpretation of the quenched fractions as a function of redshift by up to 20 percentage points. Including observational uncertainties to theoretical values of Mstars and SFR changes the quenched fraction values and their trend and/or slope with mass. Taking projected rather than three-dimensional distances for satellites decreases the quenched fractions by up to 10 per cent. TNG produces quenched fractions for both centrals and satellites broadly consistent with observations and predicts up to ∼80 (90) per cent of quenched centrals at z = 0 (z = 2), in line with recent observations, and higher than other theoretical models. The quantitative agreement of TNG and Sloan Digital Sky Survey for satellite quenched fractions in groups and clusters depends strongly on the galaxy and host mass range. Our mock comparison highlights the importance of properly accounting for observational effects and biases.},

Making use of the latest lensing models and data from the first four HFF clusters with an extensive suite of public lens models, we measure both the sizes and luminosities for 153 z{\~{}}6, 101 z{\~{}}7, and 53 z{\~{}}8 galaxies. The sizes range over more than a decade from {\~{}}500 to {\textless}50 pc. Extremely small sizes are inferred for many of our lowest luminosity sources, reaching individual sizes as small as 10-30 pc (the smallest is 11(-6)(+28) pc). The uncertainty in these measures ranges from 80 pc for the largest sources to typically about 20 pc for the smallest. Such sizes are smaller than extrapolations of the size-luminosity relation, and expectations for the completeness of our faint samples, suggesting a likely break in the size-luminosity relation at {\~{}}-17 mag with size proportional to L**(0.50(-0.11)(+0.10)). The sizes and luminosities of the lowest-luminosity sources are similar to those of single star cluster complexes like 30 Doradus in the lower-redshift universe and -- in a few cases -- super star clusters. Remarkably, our identification of these compact, faint star-forming sources in the z{\~{}}6-8 universe also allow us to set upper limits on the proto-globular cluster LF at z{\~{}}6. Comparisons with recent models allow us to rule out (with some caveats) some scenarios for proto-globular cluster formation and set useful upper limits on other less extreme ones. Our results suggest we may be very close to discovering a bona-fide population of forming globular clusters at high redshift.},

abstract = {Core-collapse supernova (SN) explosions mark the end of the tumultuous life of massive stars. Determining the nature of their progenitors is a crucial step towards understanding the properties of SNe. Until recently, no progenitor has been directly detected for SN of type Ibc, which are believed to come from massive stars that lose their Hydrogen envelope through stellar winds and from binary systems where the companion has stripped the H envelope from the primary. Here we analyze recently-reported observations of iPTF13bvn, which could possibly be the first detection of a SN Ib progenitor based on pre-explosion images. Very interestingly, the recently published Geneva models of single stars can reproduce the observed photometry of the progenitor candidate and its mass-loss rate, confirming the scenario from Cao et al 2013. We find that a single WR star with initial mass in the range 31-35 Msun fits the observed photometry of the progenitor of iPTF13bvn. The progenitor likely has a luminosity of log (L/Lsun){\~{}}5.55, surface temperature {\~{}}45000 K, and mass of {\~{}}10.9 Msun at the time of explosion. Our non-rotating 32 Msun model overestimates the derived radius of the progenitor, although this could be likely reconciled with a fine-tuned model of a more massive (between 40 and 50 Msun), hotter, and luminous progenitor. If the candidate is indeed confirmed to be the progenitor, our results suggest that stars with relatively high initial masses ({\textgreater}30 Msun) can produce visible SN explosions at their deaths and do not collapse directly to a black hole.},

This sample is uniformly selected across 17.2 deg2 (∼0.44 Gpc3 comoving volume from 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.5), mitigating the effects of cosmic variance and encompassing a wide range of environments. This area, a factor of 10 larger than previous studies, provides robust statistics at the high-mass end. Using multiwavelength data in the Spitzer/HETDEX Exploratory Large Area (SHELA) footprint, we find that the SHELA footprint star-forming galaxy stellar mass function is steeply declining at the high-mass end probing values as high as ∼10−4 Mpc3 dex−1 and as low as ∼5 × 10−8 Mpc3 dex−1 across a stellar mass range of log(M⋆/M⊙) ∼ 11–12. We compare our empirical star-forming galaxy stellar mass function at the high-mass end to three types of numerical models: hydrodynamical models from IllustrisTNG, abundance matching from the UniverseMachine, and three different semi-analytical models (SAMs; SAG, SAGE, GALACTICUS). At redshifts 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.5, we find that results from IllustrisTNG and abundance matching models agree within a factor of ∼2–10, however the three SAMs strongly underestimate (up to a factor of 1000) the number density of massive galaxies.

abstract = {Isolated dwarf galaxies nearly always exhibit robust star formation but satellite dwarf galaxies are often devoid of young stars, even in Milky Way-mass groups. Dwarf galaxies thus offer an important laboratory into the environmental processes that cease star formation. We explore the balance of quiescent and star-forming galaxies (quenched fractions) for a sample of {\~{}}400 satellite galaxies around 30 Local Volume hosts from the Exploration of Local VolumE Satellites (ELVES) Survey. We present quenched fractions as a function of satellite stellar mass, projected radius, and host halo mass, to conclude that overall, the quenched fractions are similar to the Milky Way, dropping below 50$\backslash${\%} at satellite M*{\~{}}10{\^{}}8 Msun. There is a {\~{}}10{\%} difference in quenched fraction for satellites within and outside of {\~{}}R{\_}vir/2 at fixed satellite mass. Finally, the satellite mass at which quenching grows inefficient grows steadily with host halo mass. Through comparison with the semi-analytic modeling code SatGen, we are also able to infer average quenching times as a function of satellite mass in host halo-mass bins. There is a gradual increase in quenching time with satellite stellar mass rather than the abrupt change from rapid to slow quenching that has been inferred for the Milky Way. We also generally infer longer average quenching times than recent hydrodynamical simulations. Our results vindicate models that suggest a wide range of quenching times are possible via ram pressure stripping, depending on the clumpiness of the circumgalactic medium, the orbits of the satellites, and the degree of earlier preprocessing.},

abstract = {We compare mass-selected close pairs at z {\textgreater} 1 with the intrinsic galaxy merger rate in the Illustris Simulations. To do so, we construct three 140 arcmin{\^{}}2 lightcone catalogs and measure pair fractions, finding that they change little or decrease with increasing redshift at z {\textgreater} 1. Consistent with current surveys, this trend requires a decrease in the merger-pair observability time, roughly as (1 + z){\^{}}-2, in order to measure the merger rates of the same galaxies. This implies that major mergers are more common at high redshift than implied by the simplest arguments assuming a constant observability time. Several effects contribute to this trend: (1) The fraction of massive, major (4:1) pairs which merge by today increases weakly from {\~{}}0.5 at z=1 to {\~{}}0.8 at z=3. (2) The median time elapsed between an observed pair and final remnant decreases by a factor of two from z{\~{}}1 to z{\~{}}3. (3) An increasing specific star formation rate (sSFR) decreases the time during which common stellar-mass based pair selection criteria could identify the mergers. The average orbit of the pairs at observation time varies only weakly, suggesting that the dynamical time is not varying enough to account by itself for the pair fraction trends. Merging pairs reside in dense regions, having overdensity {\~{}}10 to {\~{}}100 times greater than the average massive galaxy. We forward model the pairs to reconstruct the merger remnant production rate, showing that it is consistent with a rapid increase in galaxy merger rates at z {\textgreater} 1.},

MOSFIRE spectra were obtained in three H-band multi-slit masks in the GOODS-S field, resulting in 2 hr exposures of 36 emission-line galaxies. We compare X-ray data with the traditional emission-line ratio diagnostics and the alternative mass-excitation and color-excitation diagrams, combining new MOSFIRE infrared data with previous HST/WFC3 infrared spectra (from the 3D-HST survey) and multiwavelength photometry. We demonstrate that a high [O III]/H$\beta$ ratio is insufficient as an active galactic nucleus (AGN) indicator at z {\textgreater} 1. For the four X-ray-detected galaxies, the classic diagnostics ([O III]/H$\beta$ versus [N II]/H$\alpha$ and [S II]/H$\alpha$) remain consistent with X-ray AGN/SF classification. The X-ray data also suggest that "composite" galaxies (with intermediate AGN/SF classification) host bona fide AGNs. Nearly ∼2/3 of the z ∼ 1.5 emission-line galaxies have nuclear activity detected by either X-rays or the classic diagnostics. Compared to the X-ray and line ratio classifications, the mass-excitation method remains effective at z {\textgreater} 1, but we show that the color-excitation method requires a new calibration to successfully identify AGNs at these redshifts. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {We present results on the spectral decomposition of 118 Spitzer Infrared Spectrograph (IRS) spectra from local active galactic nuclei (AGN) using a large set of Spitzer/IRS spectra as templates. The templates are themselves IRS spectra from extreme cases where a single physical component (stellar, interstellar, or AGN) completely dominates the integrated mid-infrared emission. We show that a linear combination of one template for each physical component reproduces the observed IRS spectra of AGN hosts with unprecedented fidelity for a template fitting method, with no need to model extinction separately. We use full probability distribution functions to estimate expectation values and uncertainties for observables, and find that the decomposition results are robust against degeneracies. Furthermore, we compare the AGN spectra derived from the spectral decomposition with sub-arcsecond resolution nuclear photometry and spectroscopy from ground-based observations. We find that the AGN component derived from the decomposition closely matches the nuclear spectrum, with a 1-sigma dispersion of 0.12 dex in luminosity and typical uncertainties of {\~{}}0.19 in the spectral index and {\~{}}0.1 in the silicate strength. We conclude that the emission from the host galaxy can be reliably removed from the IRS spectra of AGN. This allows for unbiased studies of the AGN emission in intermediate and high redshift galaxies -currently inaccesible to ground-based observations- with archival Spitzer/IRS data and in the future with the Mid-InfraRed Instrument of the James Webb Space Telescope.

The R{\_}V dependent CCM relationship and the sample of extinction curves used to derive this relationship is used to describe the general behavior of Milky Way extinction curves. The ultraviolet portion of the SMC and LMC extinction curves are derived from archival IUE data, except for one new SMC extinction curve which was measured using HST/STIS observations. The optical extinction curves are derived from new (for the SMC) and literature UBVRI photometry (for the LMC). The near-infrared extinction curves are calculated mainly from 2MASS photometry supplemented with DENIS and new JHK photometry. For each extinction curve, we give R{\_}V = A(V)/E(B-V) and N(HI) values which probe the same dust column as the extinction curve. We compare the properties of the SMC and LMC extinction curves with the CCM relationship three different ways: each curve by itself, the behavior of extinction at different wavelengths with R{\_}V, and behavior of the extinction curve FM fit parameters with R{\_}V. As has been found previously, we find that a small number of LMC extinction curves are consistent with the CCM relationship, but majority of the LMC and all of the SMC curves do not follow the CCM relationship. For the first time, we find that the CCM relationship seems to form a bound on the properties of all of the LMC and SMC extinction curves. This result strengthens the picture of dust extinction curves exhibit a continuum of properties between those found in the Milky Way and the SMC Bar. (abridged)},

The target has a high stellar mass and a molecular gas fraction of {\~{}}30{\%} -- unusually high for its low star formation rate. We look for indicators of star formation suppression mechanisms in the stellar kinematics and age distribution of the galaxy obtained from spatially resolved Gemini Integral-Field spectra and in the gas kinematics obtained from ALMA.

The molecular gas is aligned with the stellar component, and we see no evidence of strong gas outflows.

We investigate the purity of simulated UVJ rest-frame colorselected massive quiescent samples with photometric uncertainties typical of deep surveys (e.g., COSMOS). We find evidence for significant contamination (up to 60 percent) by dusty star-forming galaxies in the UVJ region that is typically populated by older quiescent sources. Furthermore, simulations suggest that the completeness of UVJ-selected quiescent samples at this redshift may be reduced by 30 percent due to a high fraction of young quiescent galaxies not entering the UVJ quiescent region. Massive, quiescent galaxies in simulations have on average lower angular momenta and higher projected axis ratios and concentrations than star-forming counterparts. Average sizes of simulated quiescent galaxies are relatively close to observed ones, and broadly consistent within the uncertainties. The average size ratio of quiescent and star-forming galaxies in the probed mass range is formally consistent with observations, although this result is partly affected by poor statistics.},

abstract = {A large sample of spectroscopically confirmed star-forming galaxies at redshifts 1.4 {\textless}= z spec {\textless}= 3.7, with complementary imaging in the near- and mid-IR from the ground and from the Hubble Space Telescope and Spitzer Space Telescope, is used to infer the average star formation histories (SFHs) of typical galaxies from z {\~{}} 2 to 7. For a subset of 302 galaxies at 1.5 {\textless}= z spec {\textless} 2.6, we perform a detailed comparison of star formation rates (SFRs) determined from spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling (SFRs[SED]) and those calculated from deep Keck UV and Spitzer/MIPS 24 $\mu$m imaging (SFRs[IR+UV]). Exponentially declining SFHs yield SFRs[SED] that are 5-10 times lower on average than SFRs[IR+UV], indicating that declining SFHs may not be accurate for typical galaxies at z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 2. The SFRs of z {\~{}} 2-3 galaxies are directly proportional to their stellar masses (M *), with unity slope—a result that is confirmed with Spitzer/IRAC stacks of 1179 UV-faint ({\{}$\backslash$cal R{\}}{\textgreater}25.5) galaxies—for M * {\textgreater}{\~{}} 5 × 108 M ⊙ and SFRs {\textgreater}{\~{}} 2 M ⊙ yr-1. We interpret this result in the context of several systematic biases that can affect determinations of the SFR-M * relation. The average specific SFRs at z {\~{}} 2-3 are remarkably similar within a factor of two to those measured at z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 4, implying that the average SFH is one where SFRs increase with time. A consequence of these rising SFHs is that (1) a substantial fraction of UV-bright z {\~{}} 2-3 galaxies had faint sub-L* progenitors at z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 4; and (2) gas masses must increase with time from z = 2 to 7, over which time the net cold gas accretion rate—as inferred from the specific SFR and the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation—is {\~{}}2-3 times larger than the SFR. However, if we evolve to higher redshift the SFHs and masses of the halos that are expected to host L* galaxies at z {\~{}} 2, then we find that {\textless}{\~{}} 10{\%} of the baryons accreted onto typical halos at z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 4 actually contribute to star formation at those epochs. These results highlight the relative inefficiency of star formation even at early cosmic times when galaxies were first assembling.  Based, in part, on data obtained at the W. M. Keck Observatory, which is operated as a scientific partnership among the California Institute of Technology, the University of California, and NASA, and made possible by the generous financial support of the W.

abstract = {The primary method for inferring the stellar mass ({\$}M{\_}*{\$}) of a galaxy is through spectral energy distribution (SED) modeling. However, the technique rests on assumptions such as the galaxy star formation history and dust attenuation law that can severely impact the accuracy of derived physical properties from SED modeling. Here, we examine the effect that the assumed star formation history (SFH) has on the stellar properties inferred from SED fitting by ground truthing them against mock observations of high-resolution cosmological hydrodynamic galaxy formation simulations. Classically, SFHs are modeled with simplified parameterized functional forms, but these forms are unlikely to capture the true diversity of galaxy SFHs and may impose systematic biases with under-reported uncertainties on results. We demonstrate that flexible nonparametric star formation histories outperform traditional parametric forms in capturing variations in galaxy star formation histories, and as a result, lead to significantly improved stellar masses in SED fitting. We find a decrease in the average bias of 0.4 dex with a delayed-{\$}\backslashtau{\$} model to a bias of just under 0.05 dex for the nonparametric model. Similarly, using nonparametric star formation histories in SED fitting result in increased accuracy in recovered galaxy star formation rates (SFRs) and stellar ages.},

abstract = {Aims. The properties of dust attenuation at rest-frame UV wavelengths are inferred from very high-quality FORS2 spectra of 78 galaxies from the GMASS survey at redshift 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5. These objects complement a previously investigated sample of 108 UV-luminous, intermediate-mass (i.e., with stellar masses similar to 10(10)-10(11) M-circle dot galaxies at similar redshifts, selected from the FDF spectroscopic survey, the K20 survey, and the GDDS. Detection of the broad absorption feature centred on about 2175 angstrom ("UV bump") implies that the average UV extinction curve of a galaxy more closely resembles that of the Milky Way (MW) or the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and differs from that of the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Methods. The shape of the UV extinction curve is constrained by a parametric description of the rest-frame UV continuum with the support of a suite of models combining radiative transfer and stellar population synthesis. The UV bump is further characterised by fitting Lorentzian-like profiles. Results. Spectra exhibit a significant 2175 angstrom feature in at least 30{\%} of the cases, especially those suffering from substantial reddening. If attenuation is dominated by dust ejected from the galaxy main body via galactic winds or more localised superwinds, UV extinction curves in-between those of the SMC and LMC characterise UV-luminous, intermediate-mass galaxies at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5. The fraction of galaxies with extinction curves differing from the SMC one increases, if more dust resides in the galactic plane or dust attenuation depends on stellar age. On average, the width of the manifested UV bumps is about 60{\%} of the values typically measured along sightlines in the LMC and MW. This suggests the presence of dust similar to that found in the "supergiant" shell of ionised filaments LMC2, close to 30Dor. The presence of the carriers of the UV bump (probably organic carbon and amorphous silicates) at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5 argues for outflows from asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars being copious then. Consistent with their higher star-formation rates, the GMASS galaxies with a manifested UV bump are more luminous at rest-frame 8 mu m, where the emission is dominated by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (also products of AGB stars). In addition, they exhibit larger equivalent widths for prominent UV (metal) absorption features, mostly of interstellar origin, which indicates overall more evolved stellar populations. Conclusions. We conclude that diversification of the small-size dust component (responsible for the differential extinction at UV wavelengths and the emission at mid-IR wavelengths) has already started in the most evolved star-forming systems at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5.},

In the framework of the Garching Bonn Deep Survey (GaBoDS; Schirmer et al. 2003) consisting of about 20 square degrees of high-quality data from WFI@MPG/ESO 2.2m, our group developed an imaging pipeline for the homogeneous and efficient processing of this large data set. Having weak gravitational lensing as the main science driver, our algorithms are optimised to produce deep co-added mosaics from individual exposures obtained from empty field observations. However, the modular design of our pipeline allows an easy adaption to different scientific applications. Our system has already been ported to a large variety of optical instruments and its products have been used in various scientific contexts. In this paper we give a thorough description of the algorithms used and a careful evaluation of the accuracies reached. This concerns the removal of the instrumental signature, the astrometric alignment, photometric calibration and the characterisation of final co-added mosaics. In addition we give a more general overview on the image reduction process and comment on observing strategies where they have significant influence on the data quality.},

abstract = {According to their specific star formation rate (sSFR), galaxies are often divided into `star-forming' and `passive' populations. It is argued that the former define a narrow `Main Sequence of Star-Forming Galaxies' (MSSF) of the form {\$}\backslashsSFR(\backslashMstar){\$}, whereas `passive' galaxies feature negligible levels of star formation activity. Here we use data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey at {\$}z{\textless}0.1{\$} to constrain the conditional probability of the specific star formation rate at a given stellar mass. We show that the whole population of galaxies in the local Universe is consistent with a simple probability distribution with only one maximum (roughly corresponding to the MSSF) and relatively shallow power-law tails that fully account for the `passive' population. We compare the quality of the fits provided by such unimodal ansatz against those coming from a double log-normal fit (illustrating the bimodal paradigm), finding that both descriptions are roughly equally compatible with the current data. In addition, we study the physical interpretation of the bidimensional distribution across the {\$}M{\_}*-\backslashsSFR{\$} plane and discuss potential implications from a theoretical and observational point of view. We also investigate correlations with metallicity, morphology and environment, highlighting the need to consider at least an additional parameter in order to fully specify the physical state of a galaxy.},

From PRIMUS we construct an i {\textless} 23 flux-limited sample of ∼40, 000 galaxies at z = 0.2-1.0 over five fields totaling ≈5.5 deg2, and from the SDSS we select ∼170, 000 galaxies at z = 0.01-0.2 that we analyze consistently with respect to PRIMUS to minimize systematic errors in our evolutionary measurements. We find that the SMF of all galaxies evolves relatively little since z = 1, although we do find evidence for mass assembly downsizing; we measure a ≈30{\%} increase in the number density of ∼10 10M⊙ galaxies since z ≈ 0.6, and a ≲ 10{\%} change in the number density of all ≳ 1011M⊙ galaxies since z ≈ 1. Dividing the sample into star-forming and quiescent using an evolving cut in specific star formation rate, we find that the number density of ∼1010M⊙ star-forming galaxies stays relatively constant since z ≈ 0.6, whereas the space density of ≳ 1011M⊙ star-forming galaxies decreases by ≈50{\%} between z ≈ 1 and z ≈ 0. Meanwhile, the number density of ∼10 10M⊙ quiescent galaxies increases steeply toward low redshift, by a factor of ∼2-3 since z ≈ 0.6, while the number of massive quiescent galaxies remains approximately constant since z ≈ 1. These results suggest that the rate at which star-forming galaxies are quenched increases with decreasing stellar mass, but that the bulk of the stellar mass buildup within the quiescent population occurs around ∼1010.8 . In addition, we conclude that mergers do not appear to be a dominant channel for the stellar mass buildup of galaxies at z {\textless} 1, even among massive (≳ 10 11M⊙ ) quiescent galaxies. {\textcopyright} 2013.

abstract = {Few detailed investigations of stellar populations in passive galaxies beyond z{\~{}}1 are based on deep spectroscopic observations, due to the difficulty in obtaining such data. We present a study of stellar populations, structure, and mass-to-light ratios of a large sample of bulge-dominated galaxies in the two z=1.27 clusters Lynx E and Lynx W, based on deep ground-based optical spectroscopy combined with imaging from Hubble Space Telescope. We find that Lynx E has a well-defined core of red passive galaxies, while Lynx W lacks such a core. If all the sample galaxies evolve similarly in size from z=1.27 to the present, the data allow only 0.1 dex size-growth at a fixed dynamical mass. However, to link the Lynx central galaxies to brightest cluster galaxies similar to those of low redshift clusters, the Lynx galaxies would have to grow by at least a factor five, possibly through major merging. The mass-to-light ratios and the Balmer absorption lines of the Lynx galaxies are consistent with passive evolution of the stellar populations from z=1.27 to the present and support ages of 1--3 Gyr. The galaxies in the outskirts of the clusters contain younger stellar populations than found in the cluster cores. However, when evolved passively to z{\~{}}0 both populations are consistent with the observed populations in the Coma cluster galaxies. The bulge-dominated emission line galaxies in the clusters are dominated by stellar populations with sub-solar metallicities. Thus, additional enrichment of these is required to produce Coma-like stellar populations by z{\~{}}0.},

We measure emission line redshifts of z=7.65 and 8.64 for two galaxies, and z=9.77(+0.37,-0.29) and 10.01(+0.14,-0.19) for two others via the detection of continuum breaks consistent with Lyman-alpha opacity from a mostly neutral intergalactic medium. The presence (absense) of strong breaks (strong emission lines) give high confidence that these two galaxies are at z{\textgreater}9.6, but the break-derived redshifts have large uncertainties given the low spectral resolution and relatively low signal-to-noise of the CEERS NIRSpec prism data. The two z{\~{}}10 sources are relatively luminous (M{\_}UV{\textless}-20), with blue continua (-2.3{\textless}beta{\textless}-1.9) and low dust attenuation (A{\_}V=0.15(+0.3,-0.1)); and at least one of them has high stellar mass for a galaxy at that redshift (log(M{\_}*/M{\_}sol)=9.3(+0.2,-0.3)). Considered together with spectroscopic observations of other CEERS NIRCam-selected high-z galaxy candidates in the literature, we find a high rate of redshift confirmation and low rate of confirmed interlopers (8.3{\%}). Ten out of 34 z{\textgreater}8 candidates with CEERS NIRSpec spectroscopy do not have secure redshifts, but the absence of emission lines in their spectra is consistent with redshifts z{\textgreater}9.6. We find that z{\textgreater}8 photometric redshifts are generally in agreement (within uncertainties) with the spectroscopic values. However, the photometric redshifts tend to be slightly overestimated (average Delta(z)=0.50+/-0.12), suggesting that current templates do not fully describe the spectra of very high-z sources.

abstract = {Interstellar dust in the Magellanic Clouds, with a weak or nearly absent 2175 A extinction feature, may be of interest in studies of galaxies in early stages of chemical evolution. To this inquiry, we extend the graphite-silicate grain model, introduced by Mathis, Rumpl, and Nordsieck and developed by Draine and Lee (1984) from the Milky Way to the Magellanic Clouds. We find that the empirical extinction curves in the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds can be reproduced by adjusting only the relative abundances of graphite and silicate grains, while leaving all other model properties fixed to those appropriate for the Galactic extinction curve. Using the graphite-silicate models, we calculate the absorption and scattering optical depths, the mass-density ratio of interstellar dust to neutral hydrogen, and the Kramers-Kronig relation for all three galaxies. We also present a fitting function for the three extinction curves, valid not only over the observed range of wavelengths but also over the full range as predicted by the models. All the quantities we derived here are independent of the dust-to-gas ratios in the Milky Way and the Magellanic Clouds, and can be applied to other galaxies if they contain Galactic or Magellanic-type dust.},

abstract = {New far-infrared and submillimeter data are used to solidify and to extend to long wavelengths the empirical calibration of the infrared spectral energy distribution (SED) of normal star-forming galaxies. As was found by Dale et al. (2001), a single parameter family, characterized by f{\_}nu(60 microns)/f{\_}nu(100 microns), is adequate to describe the range of normal galaxy spectral energy distributions observed by IRAS and ISO from 3 to 100 microns. However, predictions based on the first generation models at longer wavelengths (122 to 850 microns) are increasingly overluminous compared to the data for smaller f{\_}nu(60 microns)/f{\_}nu(100 microns), or alternatively, for weaker global interstellar radiation fields. After slightly modifying the far-infrared/submillimeter dust emissivity in those models as a function of the radiation field intensity to better match the long wavelength data, a suite of SEDs from 3 microns to 20 cm in wavelength is presented. Results from relevant applications are also discussed, including submillimeter-based photometric redshift indicators, the infrared energy budget and simple formulae for recovering the bolometric infrared luminosity, and dust mass estimates in galaxies. Regarding the latter, since galaxy infrared SEDs are not well-described by single blackbody curves, the usual methods of estimating dust masses can be grossly inadequate. The improved model presented herein is used to provide a more accurate relation between infrared luminosity and dust mass.},

We find that the quiescent galaxies are largely concentrated in the overdense protocluster region with a higher quiescent fraction, showing a sign of environmental quenching. Galaxies in the protocluster are forming faster than the field counterparts as seen in the stellar mass function, suggesting early and accelerated mass assembly in the overdense regions. Although weak evidence of suppressed star-formation is found in the protocluster, the statistics are not significant enough to draw a definite conclusion. Our work shed light on how the formation of massive galaxies is affected in the dense region of a protocluster when the Universe was only 2 Gyr old.},

These measurements imply that the total dynamical masses of these systems are low (lsim 3 × 109 M ⊙). Their large [O III] $\lambda$5007 equivalent widths (500-1100 {\AA}) and faint blue continuum emission imply young ages of 10-100 Myr and stellar masses of 108-109 M ⊙, confirming the presence of a violent starburst. The dynamical masses represent the first such determinations for low-mass galaxies at z {\textgreater} 1. The stellar mass formed in this vigorous starburst phase represents a large fraction of the total (dynamical) mass, without a significantly massive underlying population of older stars.

The CO line is well fit by a single Gaussian centred 40 km s-1 away from the systemic velocity and implies a total molecular gas mass of Mgas = 7.3 × 1010, M⊙. The infrared spectral energy distribution requires three components: an active galactic nucleus (AGN) torus, an AGN polar dust component, and a starburst. The starburst dominates the infrared emission with a luminosity of log(LSB[L⊙]) = 12.91+0.02-0.02, implying a star formation rate of about 2000 M⊙yr-1, the highest known among FeLoBAL quasars. The AGN torus and polar dust components are less luminous, at log(LAGN[L⊙]) = 12.36+0.14-0.15 and log(Ldust[L⊙]) = 11.75+0.26-0.46, respectively. If all of the molecular gas is used to fuel the ongoing star formation, then the lower limit on the subsequent duration of the starburst is 40 Myr. We do not find conclusive evidence that the AGN is affecting the CO gas reservoir. The properties of SDSS1214 are consistent with it representing the endpoint of an obscured starburst transitioning through a LoBAL phase to that of a classical quasar.},

As abundances of magnesium and europium for individual stars in the Milky Way are observed across a variety of spatial locations and metallicities, comparison with the stellar abundances in our more than {\$}850{\$} Milky Way-like galaxies provides stringent constraints on our chemical evolutionary methods. To this end we use the magnesium to iron ratio as a proxy for the effects of our SNII and SNIa metal return prescription, and a means to compare our simulated abundances to a wide variety of galactic observations. The europium to iron ratio tracks the rare ejecta from neutron star -- neutron star mergers, the assumed primary site of europium production in our models, which in turn is a sensitive probe of the effects of metal diffusion within the gas in our simulations. We find that europium abundances in Milky Way-like galaxies show no correlation with assembly history, present day galactic properties, and average galactic stellar population age. In general, we reproduce the europium to iron spread at low metallicities observed in the Milky Way, with the level of enhancement being sensitive to gas properties during redshifts {\$}z \backslashapprox 2-4{\$}. We show that while the overall normalization of [Eu/Fe] is susceptible to resolution and post-processing assumptions, the relatively large spread of [Eu/Fe] at low [Fe/H] when compared to that at high [Fe/H] is very robust.},

abstract = {Forward modeling of the full galaxy SED is a powerful technique, providing self-consistent constraints on stellar ages, dust properties, and metallicities. However, the accuracy of these results is contingent on the accuracy of the model. One significant source of uncertainty is the contribution of obscured AGN, as they are relatively common and can produce substantial mid-IR (MIR) emission. Here we include emission from dusty AGN torii in the Prospector SED-fitting framework, and fit the UV-IR broadband photometry of 129 nearby galaxies. We find that 10{\%} of the fitted galaxies host an AGN contributing {\$}{\textgreater}{\$}10{\%} of the observed galaxy MIR luminosity. We demonstrate the necessity of this AGN component in the following ways. First, we compare observed spectral features to spectral features predicted from our model fit to the photometry. We find that the AGN component greatly improves predictions for observed H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} and H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} luminosities, as well as mid-infrared Akari and Spitzer/IRS spectra. Second, we show that inclusion of the AGN component changes stellar ages and SFRs by up to a factor of 10, and dust attenuations by up to a factor of 2.5. Finally, we show that the strength of our model AGN component correlates with independent AGN indicators, suggesting that these galaxies truly host AGN. Notably, only 46{\%} of the SED-detected AGN would be detected with a simple MIR color selection. Based on these results, we conclude that SED models which fit MIR data without AGN components are vulnerable to substantial bias in their derived parameters.},

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of the structure and resolved stellar populations of simulated merger remnants, and compare them to observations of compact quiescent galaxies at z ∼ 2. We find that major merging is a viable mechanism to produce systems of ∼1011 M⊙ and ∼1 kpc size, provided the gas fraction at the time of final coalescence is high (∼40{\%}) and provided that the progenitors are compact star-forming galaxies, as expected at high redshift. Their integrated spectral energy distributions and velocity dispersions are in good agreement with the observations, and their position in the (vmaj/$\sigma$, $\epsilon$) diagram traces the upper envelope of the distribution of lower redshift early-type galaxies. The simulated merger remnants show time-and sightline-dependent M/L ratio gradients that result from a superposition of radially dependent stellar age, stellar metallicity, and extinction. The median ratio of the effective radius in rest-frame V-band light to that in mass surface density is ∼2 during the quiescent remnant phase. This is typically expressed by a negative color gradient (i.e., red core), which we expect to correlate with the integrated color of the system. Finally, the simulations differ from the observations in their surface brightness profile shape. The simulated remnants are typically best fit by high (n {\textgreater}{\textgreater} 4) S{\'{e}}rsic indices, whereas observed quiescent galaxies at z ∼ 2 tend to be less cuspy ((n) ∼ 2.3). Limiting early star formation in the progenitors may be required to prevent the simulated merger remnants from having extended wings. {\textcopyright} 2010. The American Astronomical Society.

We confirm that z ˜ 2-3 galaxies show an [O III]/[O II] ratio significantly higher than a typical star-forming galaxy of SDSS by a factor of ≳ 10, and the photoionization models reveal that these high-z galaxies have an ionization parameter of log (qion/cm s-1) ˜ 7.6-9.0, a factor of ˜4-10 higher than local galaxies. For galaxies at any redshift, we identify a correlation between the [O III]/[O II] ratio and galaxy global properties of star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass (M*), and metallicity (Z). We extend the fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) and develop the fundamental ionization relation (FIR), a four-dimensional relation of ionization parameter, SFR, M*, and Z. The intermediate- and high-z galaxies up to z {\~{}}= 3 follow the FIR defined with the local galaxies, in contrast with the FMR whose possible evolution from z ˜ 2 to 3 is reported. We find that the FMR evolution of z ˜ 2-3 appears, if one omits ionization parameter differences, and that the FMR evolution does not exist for an average metallicity solution of z ˜ 3 galaxies with a high-ionization parameter. Interestingly, all of two local Lyman-continuum emitting galaxies (LyC leakers) have a high [O III]/[O II] ratio, indicating a positive correlation between [O III]/[O II] and ionizing photon escape fraction (fesc), which is successfully explained by our photoionization models. Because [O III]/[O II] ratios of z ˜ 2-3 galaxies, especially Lyalpha emitters (LAEs), are comparable to, or higher than, those of the local LyC leakers, these high-z galaxies are candidates of Lyman-continuum emitting objects. A strong Lyalpha emission can coexist with a large fesc of ≲ 0.8, and the increasing fraction of LAEs towards high-z reconciles the picture of cosmic reionization whose major ionizing sources are faint galaxies having intrinsically bright Lyalpha emission.},

Multi-Epoch Abundance Matching (MEAM) is used to define potential progenitors of a z = 0 galaxy of stellar mass 1.5 10{\^{}}11 M{\_}sun. Gas masses are derived from the 850um luminosity. Ancillary data from the CANDELS GOODS-S survey are used to derive the gas mass fractions. The results at z{\textless}=3 are mostly in accord with expectations: The detection rates are 75{\%} for the z=2 redshift bin, 50{\%} for the z=3 bin and 0{\%} for z{\textgreater}=4. The average gas mass fraction for the detected z=2 galaxies is f{\_}gas = 0.55+/-0.12 and f{\_}gas = 0.62+/-0.15 for the z=3 sample. This agrees with expectations for galaxies on the star-forming main sequence, and shows that gas fractions have decreased at a roughly constant rate from z=3 to z=0. Stacked images of the galaxies not detected with ALMA give upper limits to f{\_}gas of {\textless}0.08 and {\textless}0.15, for the z=2 and z=3 redshift bins. None of our galaxies in the z=4 and z=5 sample are detected and the upper limit from stacked images, corrected for low metallicity, is f{\_}gas{\textless}0.66. We do not think that lower gas-phase metallicities can entirely explain the lower dust luminosities. We briefly consider the possibility of accretion of very low-metallicity gas to explain the absence of detectable dust emission in our galaxies at z{\textgreater}4.},

abstract = {We present deep Keck spectroscopy for 17 morphologically selected field spheroidals in the redshift range 1.05 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.60 in order to investigate the continuity in physical properties between the claimed massive compact red galaxies ("nuggets") at z ≃ 2 and well-established data for massive spheroidal galaxies below z ≃ 1. By combining Keck-based stellar velocity dispersions with Hubble Space Telescope-based sizes, we find that the most massive systems (M dyn{\textgreater}1011 M ⊙) grew in size over 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.6 as (1+z)-0.75±0.10 (i.e., ×2 since z = 1.5) whereas intermediate mass systems (1011 M ⊙{\textgreater}M dyn{\textgreater}1010 M ⊙) did not grow significantly. These trends are consistent with a picture in which more massive spheroidals formed at higher redshift via "wetter" mergers involving greater dissipation. To examine growth under the favored "dry" merger hypothesis, we also examine size growth at a fixed velocity dispersion. This test, uniquely possible with our dynamical data, allows us to consider the effects of "progenitor bias." Above our completeness limit ($\sigma${\textgreater}200 km s-1), we find size growth consistent with that inferred for the mass-selected sample, thus ruling out strong progenitor bias. To maintain continuity in the growth of massive galaxies over the past 10 Gyr, our new results imply that size evolution over 1.3 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.3, a period of 1.9 Gyr, must have been even more dramatic than hitherto claimed if the red sources at z{\textgreater}2 are truly massive and compact. {\textcopyright} 2010.

abstract = {Detecting galaxies when their star-formation is being quenched is crucial to understand the mechanisms driving their evolution. We identify for the first time a sample of quenching galaxies selected just after the interruption of their star formation by exploiting the [O III]5007/Halpha ratio and searching for galaxies with undetected [O III]. Using a sample of {\~{}}174000 star-forming galaxies extracted from the SDSS-DR8 at 0.04 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.21,we identify the {\~{}}300 quenching galaxy best candidates with low [O III]/Halpha, out of {\~{}}26000 galaxies without [O III] emission. They have masses between 10{\^{}}9.7 and 10{\^{}}10.8 Mo, consistently with the corresponding growth of the quiescent population at these redshifts. Their main properties (i.e. star-formation rate, colours and metallicities) are comparable to those of the star-forming population, coherently with the hypothesis of recent quenching, but preferably reside in higher-density environments.Most candidates have morphologies similar to star-forming galaxies, suggesting that no morphological transformation has occurred yet. From a survival analysis we find a low fraction of candidates ({\~{}}0.58{\%} of the star-forming population), leading to a short quenching timescale of tQ{\~{}}50Myr and an e-folding time for the quenching history of tauQ{\~{}}90Myr, and their upper limits of tQ{\textless}0.76 Gyr and tauQ{\textless}1.5Gyr, assuming as quenching galaxies 50{\%} of objects without [O III] ({\~{}}7.5{\%}).Our results are compatible with a 'rapid' quenching scenario of satellites galaxies due to the final phase of strangulation or ram-pressure stripping. This approach represents a robust alternative to methods used so far to select quenched galaxies (e.g. colours, specific star-formation rate, or post-starburst spectra).},

abstract = {This paper describes the as-built performance of MOSFIRE, the multi-object spectrometer and imager for the Cassegrain focus of the 10-m Keck 1 telescope. MOSFIRE provides near-infrared (0.97 to 2.41 $\mu$m) multi-object spectroscopy over a 6.1' x 6.1' field of view with a resolving power of R{\~{}}3,500 for a 0.7" (0.508 mm) slit (2.9 pixels in the dispersion direction), or imaging over a field of view of {\~{}}6.9' diameter with {\~{}}0.18" per pixel sampling. A single diffraction grating can be set at two fixed angles, and order-sorting filters provide spectra that cover the K, H, J or Y bands by selecting 3rd, 4th, 5th or 6th order respectively. A folding flat following the field lens is equipped with piezo transducers to provide tip/tilt control for flexure compensation at the {\textless}0.1 pixel level. Instead of fabricated focal plane masks requiring frequent cryo-cycling of the instrument, MOSFIRE is equipped with a cryogenic Configurable Slit Unit (CSU) developed in collaboration with the Swiss Center for Electronics and Microtechnology (CSEM). Under remote control the CSU can form masks containing up to 46 slits with {\~{}}0.007-0.014" precision. Reconfiguration time is {\textless} 6 minutes. Slits are formed by moving opposable bars from both sides of the focal plane. An individual slit has a length of 7.0" but bar positions can be aligned to make longer slits in increments of 7.5". When masking bars are retracted from the field of view and the grating is changed to a mirror, MOSFIRE becomes a wide-field imager. The detector is a 2K x 2K H2-RG HgCdTe array from Teledyne Imaging Sensors with low dark current and low noise. Results from integration and commissioning are presented.},

Our determined metallicity of HIP 102152 is [Fe/H] = -0.013 {\$}\backslashpm{\$} 0.004. The atmospheric parameters of the star were determined to be 54 K cooler than the Sun, 0.09 dex lower in surface gravity, and a microturbulence identical to our derived solar value. Elemental abundance ratios examined vs. dust condensation temperature reveal a solar abundance pattern for this star, in contrast to most solar twins. The abundance pattern of HIP 02152 appears to be the most similar to solar of any known solar twin. Abundances of the younger, 2.9 Gyr solar twin, 18 Sco, were also determined from UVES spectra to serve as a comparison for HIP 102152. The solar chemical pattern of HIP 102152 makes it a potential candidate to host terrestrial planets, which is reinforced by the lack of giant planets in its terrestrial planet region. The following non-local thermodynamic equilibrium Li abundances were obtained for HIP 102152, 18 Sco, and the Sun: log {\$}\backslashepsilon{\$} (Li) = 0.48 {\$}\backslashpm{\$} 0.07, 1.62 {\$}\backslashpm{\$} 0.02, and 1.07 {\$}\backslashpm{\$} 0.02, respectively. The Li abundance of HIP 102152 is the lowest reported to date for a solar twin, and allows us to consider an emerging, tightly constrained Li-age trend for solar twin stars.},

Fitting the 60,100 and 850 micron fluxes with a single temperature dust model gives the sample mean temperature T=36 K and beta = 1.3. We do not rule out the possibility of dust which is colder than this, if a 20 K component was present then our dust masses would increase by factor 1.5-3. We present the first measurements of the luminosity and dust mass functions, which were well fitted by Schechter functions (unlike those 60 microns). We have correlated many global galaxy properties with the submillimetre and find that there is a tendancy for less optically luminous galaxies to contain warmer dust and have greater star formation efficiencies (cf. Young 1999). The average gas-to-dust ratio for the sample is 581 +/- 43 (using both atomic and molecular hydrogen), significantly higher than the Galactic value of 160. We believe this discrepancy is due to a cold dust component at T {\textless} 20 K. There is a suprisingly tight correlation between dust mass and the mass of molecular hydrogen as estimated from CO measurements, with an intrinsic scatter of {\~{}}50{\%}.},

abstract = {UV observations in the local universe have uncovered a population of early-type galaxies with UV flux consistent with low-level recent or ongoing star formation. Understanding the origin of such star formation remains an open issue. We present resolved UV-optical photometry of a sample of 19 Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) early-type galaxies at z {\~{}} 0.1 drawn from the sample originally selected by Salim {\&} Rich to lie in the bluer part of the green valley in the UV-optical color-magnitude diagram as measured by the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX). Utilizing high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) far-UV imaging provides unique insight into the distribution of UV light in these galaxies, which we call extended star-forming early-type galaxies (ESF-ETGs) because of extended UV emission that is indicative of recent star formation. The UV-optical color profiles of all ESF-ETGs show red centers and blue outer parts. Their outer colors require the existence of a significant underlying population of older stars in the UV-bright regions. An analysis of stacked SDSS spectra reveals weak LINER-like emission in their centers. Using a cross-matched SDSS DR7/GALEX GR6 catalog, we search for other green valley galaxies with similar properties to these ESF-ETGs and estimate that 13{\%} of dust-corrected green valley galaxies of similar stellar mass and UV-optical color are likely ESF-candidates, i.e., ESF-ETGs are not rare. Our results are consistent with star formation that is gradually declining in existing disks, i.e., the ESF-ETGs are evolving onto the red sequence for the first time, or with rejuvenated star formation due to accreted gas in older disks provided that the gas does not disrupt the structure of the galaxy and the resulting star formation is not too recent and bursty. ESF-ETGs may typify an important subpopulation of galaxies that can linger in the green valley for up to several Gyrs, based on their resemblance to nearby gas-rich green valley galaxies with low-level ongoing star formation.},

abstract = {Post-starburst E+A galaxies are believed to be systems in a rapid transition between major merger starbursts and quiescent ellipticals. Their optical spectrum is dominated by A-type stars, suggesting a significant starburst that was quenched recently. While optical observations of post-starburst galaxies suggest little ongoing star formation, they have been shown to host significant molecular gas reservoirs. This led to the suggestion that gas consumption or expulsion are not required to end the starburst, and that star formation is suppressed by turbulent heating of the molecular gas. We present NOEMA continuum and CO(1-0) observations of 15 post-starburst galaxies, and collect CO measurements in post-starburst galaxies from the literature. Using archival far-infrared observations, we show that the majority of these systems host obscured star formation, with some showing far-infrared emission that is comparable to those of luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies. Once far-infrared star formation rates are used, these systems show similar SFR-{\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}H{\_}2{\}}{\}}{\$} and Kennicutt-Schmidt relations to those observed in star-forming and starburst galaxies. In particular, there is no need to hypothesize star formation quenching by processes other than the consumption of molecular gas by star formation. The combination of optical, far-infrared, and CO observations indicates that some regions within these galaxies have been recently quenched, while others are still forming stars at a high rate. We find little connection between the post-burst age of the optically-thin quenched regions and the star formation rate in the obscured regions. All this calls into question the traditional classification of E+A galaxies.},

CR7's Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} halo is clearly elongated along the direction connecting the multiple components, likely tracing the underlying gas distribution. The Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emission originates almost exclusively from the brightest UV component, but we also identify a faint kinematically distinct Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emitting region nearby a fainter component. Combined with new near-infrared data, the MUSE data show that the rest-frame Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} equivalent width (EW) is {\$}\backslashapprox100{\$} {\{}$\backslash$AA{\}}. This is a factor four higher than the EW measured in low-redshift analogues with carefully matched Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} profiles (and thus arguably HI column density), but this EW can plausibly be explained by star formation. Alternative scenarios requiring AGN powering are also disfavoured by the narrower and steeper Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} spectrum and much smaller IR to UV ratio compared to obscured AGN in other Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} blobs.

abstract = {The accelerating expansion of the Universe, and the need for dark energy, were inferred from observations of type Ia supernovae. There is a consensus that type Ia supernovae are thermonuclear explosions that destroy carbon-oxygen white dwarf stars that have accreted matter from a companion star, although the nature of this companion remains uncertain. These supernovae are thought to be reliable distance indicators because they have a standard amount of fuel and a uniform trigger: they are predicted to explode when the mass of the white dwarf nears the Chandrasekhar mass of 1.4 solar masses (M(o)). Here we show that the high-redshift supernova SNLS-03D3bb has an exceptionally high luminosity and low kinetic energy that both imply a super-Chandrasekhar-mass progenitor. Super-Chandrasekhar-mass supernovae should occur preferentially in a young stellar population, so this may provide an explanation for the observed trend that overluminous type Ia supernovae occur only in 'young' environments. As this supernova does not obey the relations that allow type Ia supernovae to be calibrated as standard candles, and as no counterparts have been found at low redshift, future cosmology studies will have to consider possible contamination from such events.},

abstract = {Star formation rate (SFR) distributions of galaxies are often assumed to be bimodal with modes corresponding to star-forming and quiescent galaxies, respectively. Both classes of galaxies are typically studied separately and SFR distributions of star-forming galaxies are commonly modelled as lognormals. Using both observational data and results from numerical simulations, I argue that this division into star-forming and quiescent galaxies is unnecessary from a theoretical point of view and that the SFR distributions of the whole population can be well fit by zero-inflated negative binomial distributions. This family of distributions has 3 parameters that determine the average SFR of the galaxies in the sample, the scatter relative to the star-forming sequence, and the fraction of galaxies with zero SFRs, respectively. The proposed distributions naturally account for (i) the discrete nature of star formation, (ii) the presence of 'dead' galaxies with zero SFRs, and (iii) asymmetric scatter. Excluding 'dead' galaxies, the distribution of log SFR is unimodal with a peak at the star forming sequence and an extended tail towards low SFRs. However, uncertainties and biases in the SFR measurements can create the appearance of a bimodal distribution.},

abstract = {We present a new characterization of the relations between star-formation rate, stellar mass and molecular gas mass surface densities at different spatial scales across galaxies (from galaxy wide to kpc-scales). To do so we make use of the largest sample combining spatially-resolved spectroscopic information with CO observations, provided by the EDGE-CALIFA survey, together with new single dish CO observations obtained by APEX. We show that those relations are the same at the different explored scales, sharing the same distributions for the explored data, with similar slope, intercept and scatter (when characterized by a simple power-law). From this analysis, we propose that these relations are the projection of a single relation between the three properties that follows a distribution well described by a line in the three-dimension parameter space. Finally, we show that observed secondary relations between the residuals and the considered parameters are fully explained by the correlation between the uncertainties, and therefore have no physical origin. We discuss these results in the context of the hypothesis of self-regulation of the star-formation process.},

abstract = {The dominant baryonic component of galaxy clusters is hot gas whose distribution is commonly probed through X-ray emission arising from thermal bremsstrahlung. The density profile thus obtained has been traditionally modeled with a beta-profile, a simple function with only three parameters. However, this model is known to be insufficient for characterizing the range of cluster gas distributions, and attempts to rectify this shortcoming typically introduce additional parameters to increase the fitting flexibility. We use cosmological and physical considerations to obtain a family of profiles for the gas with fewer parameters than the beta-model but which better accounts for observed gas profiles over wide radial intervals.},

abstract = {We present constraints on the formation and evolution of early-type galaxies (ETGs) with the empirical model EMERGE. The parameters of this model are adjusted so that it reproduces the evolution of stellar mass functions, specific star formation rates, and cosmic star formation rates since {\$}z\backslashapprox10{\$} as well as 'quenched' galaxy fractions and correlation functions. We find that at fixed halo mass present-day ETGs are more massive than late-type galaxies, whereas at fixed stellar mass ETGs populate more massive halos in agreement with lensing results. This effect naturally results from the shape and scatter of the stellar-to-halo mass relation and the galaxy formation histories. The ETG stellar mass assembly is dominated by 'in-situ' star formation below a stellar mass of {\$}3\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}\backslashmathrm{\{}M{\}}{\_}\backslashodot{\$} and by merging and accretion of 'ex-situ' formed stars at higher mass. The mass dependence is in tension with current cosmological simulations. Lower mass ETGs show extended star formation towards low redshift in agreement with recent estimates from IFU surveys. All ETGs have main progenitors on the 'main sequence of star formation' with the 'red sequence' appearing at {\$}z \backslashapprox 2{\$}. Above this redshift, over 95 per cent of the ETG progenitors are star-forming. More than 90 per cent of {\$}z \backslashapprox 2{\$} 'main sequence' galaxies with {\$}m{\_}* {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}\backslashmathrm{\{}M{\}}{\_}\backslashodot{\$} evolve into present-day ETGs.

This implies that current and future high redshift observations mainly probe the birth of present-day ETGs. The source code and documentation of EMERGE are available at github.com/bmoster/emerge.},

We compared their properties with those of a control sample of median-sized quiescent galaxies with similar effective velocity dispersions. MCGs have elevated rotational support, as evidenced by a strong anti-correlation between the Gauss-Hermite moment {\$}h{\_}3{\$} and {\$}V/\backslashsigma{\$}. In contrast, 30{\$}\backslash{\%}{\$} of control sample galaxies (CSGs) are slow rotators, and fast-rotating CSGs generally show a weak {\$}h{\_}3{\$}-{\$}V/\backslashsigma{\$} anti-correlation. MCGs and CSGs have similar ages, but MCGs are more metal-rich and {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-enhanced. Both MCGs and CSGs have shallow negative metallicity gradients and flat [{\$}\backslashalpha{\$}/Fe] gradients. On average, MCGs and CSGs have flat age gradients, but CSGs have a significantly larger dispersion of gradient values. The kinematics and SP properties of MCGs suggest that they experienced highly-dissipative gas-rich events, such as mergers, followed by an intense, short, and centrally concentrated burst of star formation, between 4 to 10 Gyr ago ({\$}z\backslashsim0.4-2{\$}), and had a quiet accretion history since then. This sequence of events might be analogous to, although less extreme than, the compaction events which formed compact quiescent galaxies at {\$}z \backslashsim 2{\$}. The small sizes of MCGs, and the high efficiency and short duration of their last star formation episode suggest that they are descendants of compact post-starburst galaxies.},

We present the photometric and spectroscopic observations of the supernova and its host by ROTSE-III, HET and Keck. From the H{\_}alpha line identified in the host spectra, we determine a redshift of 0.0736. At this distance, the supernova reached an absolute magnitude of -20.4, brighter than any other SNe Ia ever observed. If the source of luminosity is radioactive decay, a large amount of radioactive nickel ({\~{}}1.5 solar masses) is required to power the peak luminosity, more than can be produced realistically in a Chandrasekhar mass progenitor. Low expansion velocity, similar to that of 2003fg, is also measured around the maximum light. The observations may suggest that SN 2007if was from a massive white dwarf progenitor, plausibly exploding with mass well beyond 1.4 solar masses. Alternatively, we investigate circumstellar interaction that may contribute to the excess luminosity.},

abstract = {Active galactic nuclei (AGN) are believed to regulate star formation inside their host galaxies through "AGN feedback". We summarise our on-going study of luminous AGN (z{\~{}}0.2-3; L{\_}(AGN,bol){\textgreater}{\~{}}10{\^{}}43 erg/s), which is designed to search for observational signatures of feedback by combining observed star-formation rate (SFR) measurements from statistical samples with cosmological model predictions. Using the EAGLE hydrodynamical cosmological simulations, in combination with our Herschel+ALMA surveys, we show that - even in the presence of AGN feedback - we do not necessarily expect to see any relationships between average galaxy-wide SFRs and instantaneous AGN luminosities. We caution that the correlation with stellar mass for both SFR and AGN luminosity can contribute to apparent observed positive trends between these two quantities. On the other hand, the EAGLE simulations, which reproduce our observations, predict that a signature of AGN feedback can be seen in the wide specific SFR distributions of {\$}all{\$} massive galaxies (not just AGN hosts). Overall, whilst we can not rule out that AGN have an immediate small-scale impact on in-situ star-formation, all of our results are consistent with a feedback model where galaxy-wide in-situ star formation is not rapidly suppressed by AGN, but where the feedback likely acts over a longer timescale than a single AGN episode.},

Sources have been selected from the DR1 UltraVISTA K{\_}{\{}s{\}}-band imaging which covers a unique combination of a wide area (1.62 deg{\^{}}2), to a significant depth (K{\_}{\{}s,tot{\}} = 23.4). The SMFs of the combined population are in good agreement with previous measurements and show that the stellar mass density of the universe was only 50{\%}, 10{\%} and 1{\%} of its current value at z {\~{}} 0.75, 2.0, and 3.5, respectively. The quiescent population drives most of the overall growth, with the stellar mass density of these galaxies increasing by 2.71{\^{}}{\{}+0.93{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.22{\}} dex since z = 3.5. At z {\textgreater} 2.5, star-forming galaxies dominate the total SMF at all stellar masses, although a nonzero population of quiescent galaxies persists to z = 4. Comparisons of the K{\_}{\{}s{\}}-selected star-forming galaxy SMFs to UV-selected SMFs at 2.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 4 show reasonable agreement and suggests UV-selected samples are representative of the majority of the stellar mass density at z {\textgreater} 3.5. We estimate the average mass growth of individual galaxies by selecting galaxies at fixed cumulative number density. The average galaxy with Log(M{\_}{\{}*{\}}/M{\_}{\{}sun{\}}) = 11.5 at z = 0.3 has grown in mass by only 0.2 dex (0.3 dex) since z = 2.0(3.5), whereas those with Log(M{\_}{\{}*{\}}/M{\_}{\{}sun{\}}) = 10.5 have grown by {\textgreater} 1.0 dex since z = 2. At z {\textless} 2, the time derivatives of the mass growth are always larger for lower-mass galaxies, which demonstrates that the mass growth in galaxies since that redshift is mass-dependent and primarily bottom-up. Lastly, we examine potential sources of systematic uncertainties on the SMFs and find that those from photo-z templates, SPS modeling, and the definition of quiescent galaxies dominate the total error budget in the SMFs.},

abstract = {We use a newly assembled large sample of 3,545 star-forming galaxies with secure spectroscopic, grism, and photometric redshifts at z=1.5-2.5 to constrain the relationship between UV slope (beta) and dust attenuation (L(IR)/L(UV)=IRX). Our sample benefits from the combination of deep Hubble WFC3/UVIS photometry from the Hubble Deep UV (HDUV) Legacy survey and existing photometric data compiled in the 3D-HST survey, and extends the range of UV luminosity and beta probed in previous UV-selected samples. IRX is measured using stacks of deep Herschel/PACS 100 and 160 micron data, and the results are compared with predictions of the IRX-beta relation for different assumptions of the stellar population model and obscuration curve. We find that z=1.5-2.5 galaxies have an IRX-beta relation that is consistent with the predictions for an SMC extinction curve if we invoke sub-solar metallicity models that are currently favored for high-redshift galaxies, while the commonly assumed starburst attenuation curve over-predicts the IRX at a given beta by a factor of {\~{}}3. The IRX of high-mass (M*{\textgreater}10{\^{}}9.75 Msun) galaxies is a factor of {\textgreater}4 larger than that of low-mass galaxies, lending support for the use of stellar mass as a proxy for attenuation. The commonly observed trend of fainter galaxies having bluer beta may simply reflect bluer intrinsic UV slopes for such galaxies, rather than lower obscurations. The IRX-beta for young/low-mass galaxies implies a dust curve that is steeper than the SMC, suggesting a lower attenuation at a given beta relative to older/more massive galaxies. The lower attenuations and higher ionizing photon output implied by low metallicity stellar population models point to Lyman continuum production efficiencies, xi{\_}ion, that may be elevated by a factor of {\~{}}2 relative to the canonical value for L* galaxies, aiding in their ability to keep the universe ionized at z{\~{}}2.

abstract = {We identify an abundant population of extreme emission line galaxies (EELGs) at redshift z{\~{}}1.7 in the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) imaging from Hubble Space Telescope/Wide Field Camera 3 (HST/WFC3). 69 EELG candidates are selected by the large contribution of exceptionally bright emission lines to their near-infrared broad-band magnitudes. Supported by spectroscopic confirmation of strong [OIII] emission lines -- with rest-frame equivalent widths {\~{}}1000$\backslash$AA -- in the four candidates that have HST/WFC3 grism observations, we conclude that these objects are galaxies with 10{\^{}}8 Msol in stellar mass, undergoing an enormous starburst phase with M{\_}*/(dM{\_}*/dt) of only {\~{}}15 Myr. These bursts may cause outflows that are strong enough to produce cored dark matter profiles in low-mass galaxies. The individual star formation rates and the co-moving number density (3.7x10{\^{}}-4 Mpc{\^{}}-3) can produce in {\~{}}4 Gyr much of the stellar mass density that is presently contained in 10{\^{}}8-10{\^{}}9 Msol dwarf galaxies. Therefore, our observations provide a strong indication that many or even most of the stars in present-day dwarf galaxies formed in strong, short-lived bursts, mostly at z{\textgreater}1.},

abstract = {The current knowledge on the stellar IMF is documented. It is usuallydescribed as being invariant, but evidence to the contrary has emerged: it appears to become top-heavy when the star-formation rate density surpasses aboutonaand it may become increasingly bottom-heavy withincreasing metallicity and in increasingly massive elliptical galaxies. Itdeclines quite steeply below about with brown dwarfs (BDs) and verymass stars having their own IMF. Themost massive star of mass m max formed in an embedded cluster with stellar mass Mecl correlates strongly with Mecl being a result of gravitation-driven but resource-limited growth and fragmentation-induced starvation. There is no convincing evidence whatsoeverthat massive stars do form in isolation. Massive stars form above a density threshold in embedded clusters which become saturated when which appears to be the canonical physical upper mass limit of stars. Super-canonical massive stars arise naturally due to stellar mergers induced bystellar–dynamical encounters in binary–rich very young dense clusters. Various methods of discretising a stellar population are introduced: optimal sampling leads to a mass distribution that perfectly represents the exact form of the desired IMF and the mmax Mecl relation, while random sampling results in statistical variations of the shape of the IMF. The observed mmax Mecl correlation and the small spread of IMF power–law indices together suggest that optimally sampling the IMF may be the more realistic description of star formation than random sampling from a universal IMF with a constant upper mass limit. Composite populations on galaxy scales, which are formed from manyscale star formatiom events, need to be described by the integrated galactic IMF. This IGIMF varies systematically from top–light to top–heavy in dependence of galaxy type and star formation rate, with dramatic implications for theories of galaxy formation and evolution.},

(2012) and 478 field galaxies with log(M){\textgreater}9 using photometric redshifts from the ZFOURGE survey. We compare the mass-size relation of field and cluster galaxies using measured galaxy semi-major axis half-light radii ({\$}r{\_}{\{}1/2,maj{\}}{\$}) from CANDELS HST/F160W imaging. We find consistent mass normalized (log(M)=10.7) sizes for quiescent field galaxies ({\$}r{\_}{\{}1/2,maj{\}}=1.81\backslashpm0.29{\$} kpc) and quiescent cluster galaxies ({\$}r{\_}{\{}1/2,maj{\}}=2.17\backslashpm0.63{\$} kpc). The mass normalized size of star-forming cluster galaxies ({\$}r{\_}{\{}1/2,maj{\}}=4.00\backslashpm0.26{\$} kpc ) is 12{\%} larger (KS test {\$}2.1\backslashsigma{\$}) than star-forming field galaxies ({\$}r{\_}{\{}1/2,maj{\}}=3.57\backslashpm0.10{\$} kpc). From the mass-color relation we find that quiescent field galaxies with 9.7{\textless}log(M){\textless}10.4 are slightly redder (KS test {\$}3.6\backslashsigma{\$}) than quiescent cluster galaxies, while cluster and field quiescent galaxies with log(M){\textgreater}10.4 have consistent colors. We find that star-forming cluster galaxies are on average 20{\%} redder than star-forming field galaxies at all masses. Furthermore, we stack galaxy images to measure average radial color profiles as a function of mass. Negative color gradients are only present for massive star-forming field and cluster galaxies with log(M){\textgreater}10.4, the remaining galaxy masses and types have flat profiles. Our results suggest given the observed differences in size and color of star-forming field and cluster galaxies, that the environment has begun to influence/accelerate their evolution. However, the lack of differences between field and cluster quiescent galaxies indicates that the environment has not begun to significantly influence their evolution at z{\~{}}2.},

@article{Charlot2000,
abstract = {We present a new model to compute the effects of dust on the integrated spectral properties of galaxies, based on an idealized prescription of the main features of the interstellar medium (ISM). The model includes the ionization of HII regions in the interiors of the dense clouds in which stars form and the influence of the finite lifetime of these clouds on the absorption of radiation. We compute the production of emission lines and the absorption of continuum radiation in the HII regions and the subsequent transfer of line and continuum radiation in the surrounding HI regions and the ambient ISM. This enables us to interpret simultaneously all the observations of a homogeneous sample of nearby UV-selected starburst galaxies, including the ratio of far-IR to UV luminosities, the ratio of Halpha to Hbeta luminosities, the Halpha equivalent width, and the UV spectral slope. We show that the finite lifetime of stellar birth clouds is a key ingredient to resolve an apparent discrepancy between the attenuation of line and continuum photons in starburst galaxies. In addition, we find that an effective absorption curve proportional to lambda{\^{}}-0.7 reproduces the observed relation between the ratio of far-IR to UV luminosities and the UV spectral slope. We interpret this relation most simply as a sequence in the overall dust content of the galaxies. The shallow wavelength dependence of the effective absorption curve is compatible with the steepness of known extinction curves if the dust has a patchy distribution. In particular, we find that a random distribution of discrete clouds with optical depths similar to those in the Milky Way provides a consistent interpretation of all the observations. Our model for absorption can be incorporated easily into any population synthesis model. (abridged)},

abstract = {We use the IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulations to show how the fractions of quenched galaxies vary across different environments and cosmic time, and to quantify the role AGN feedback and pre-processing play in quenching group and cluster satellites. At z = 0, we select galaxies with Mstars = 109−12 M⊙ residing within (≤R200c) massive groups and clusters of total host mass M200c = 1013−15.2 M⊙ in TNG100 and TNG300. The model predicts a quenched fraction of ∼70–90 per cent (on average) for centrals and satellites of mass ≳ 1010.5 M⊙, regardless of host mass, cosmic time (0 ≤ z ≤ 0.5), cluster-centric distance, and time since infall in the z = 0 host. Low-mass central galaxies (≲ 1010 M⊙), on the other hand, are rarely quenched unless they become members of groups (1013–14 M⊙) or clusters (≥1014 M⊙), where the quenched fraction rises to ∼ 80 per cent. Typically, the fraction of low-mass passive galaxies is higher closer to the host centre and for progressively more massive hosts. The population of low-mass satellites accreted more than ∼ 4–6 Gyr ago in massive hosts is almost entirely passive, thus suggesting an upper limit for the time needed for environmental quenching to occur. In fact, about 30 per cent of group and cluster satellites that are quenched at z = 0 were already quenched before falling into their current host, and the bulk of them quenched as early as 4–10 billion years ago. For low-mass galaxies (Mstars ≲ 1010–10.5 M⊙), this is due to pre-processing, whereby current satellites may have been members of other hosts, and hence have undergone environmental processes, before falling into their final host, this mechanism being more common and more effective for the purposes of quenching for satellites found today in more massive hosts. On the other hand, massive galaxies quench on their own and because of AGN feedback, regardless of whether they are centrals or satellites.},

abstract = {The Herschel Space Observatory has revealed a very different galaxyscape from that shown by optical surveys which presents a challenge for galaxy-evolution models. The Herschel surveys reveal (1) that there was rapid galaxy evolution in the very recent past and (2) that galaxies lie on a a single Galaxy Sequence (GS) rather than a star-forming `main sequence' and a separate region of `passive' or `red-and-dead' galaxies. The form of the GS is now clearer because far-infrared surveys such as the Herschel ATLAS pick up a population of optically-red star-forming galaxies that would have been classified as passive using most optical criteria. The space-density of this population is at least as high as the traditional star-forming population. By stacking spectra of H-ATLAS galaxies over the redshift range 0.001 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.4, we show that the galaxies responsible for the rapid low-redshift evolution have high stellar masses, high star-formation rates but, even several billion years in the past, old stellar populations - they are thus likely to be relatively recent ancestors of early-type galaxies in the Universe today. The form of the GS is inconsistent with rapid quenching models and neither the analytic bathtub model nor the hydrodynamical EAGLE simulation can reproduce the rapid cosmic evolution. We propose a new gentler model of galaxy evolution that can explain the new Herschel results and other key properties of the galaxy population.},

abstract = {Post-starburst galaxies are typically considered to be a transition population, en route to the red sequence after a recent quenching event. Despite this, recent observations have shown that these objects typically have large reservoirs of cold molecular gas. In this paper we study the star-forming gas properties of a large sample of post-starburst galaxies selected from the cosmological, hydrodynamical EAGLE simulations. These objects resemble observed high-mass post-starburst galaxies both spectroscopically and in terms of their space density, stellar mass distribution and sizes. We find that the vast majority of simulated post-starburst galaxies have significant gas reservoirs, with star-forming gas masses of {\~{}}10{\$}{\^{}}9{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, in good agreement with those seen in observational samples. The simulation reproduces the observed time evolution of the gas fraction of the post-starburst galaxy population, with the average galaxy losing {\~{}}90 per cent of its star-forming interstellar medium in only {\~{}}600 Myr. A variety of gas consumption/loss processes are responsible for this rapid evolution, including mergers and environmental effects, while active galactic nuclei play only a secondary role. The fast evolution in the gas fraction of post-starburst galaxies is accompanied by a clear decrease in the efficiency of star formation, due to a decrease in the dense gas fraction. We predict that forthcoming ALMA observations of the gas reservoirs of low-redshift post-starburst galaxies will show that the molecular gas is typically compact and has disturbed kinematics, reflecting the disruptive nature of many of the evolutionary pathways that build up the post-starburst galaxy population.},

abstract = {GN-z11 was photometrically selected as a luminous star-forming galaxy candidate at redshift z {\textgreater} 10 on the basis of Hubble Space Telescope imaging data1. Follow-up Hubble Space Telescope near-infrared grism observations detected a continuum break that was explained as the Ly$\alpha$ break corresponding to z=11.09−0.12+0.08 (ref. 2). However, its accurate redshift remained unclear. Here we report a probable detection of three ultraviolet emission lines from GN-z11, which can be interpreted as the [C iii] $\lambda$1907, C iii] $\lambda$1909 doublet and O iii] $\lambda$1666 at z = 10.957 ± 0.001 (when the Universe was only {\~{}}420 Myr old, or {\~{}}3{\%} of its current age). This is consistent with the redshift of the previous grism observations, supporting GN-z11 as the most distant galaxy known to date. Its ultraviolet lines probably originate from dense ionized gas that is rarely seen at low redshifts, and its strong [C iii] and C iii] emission is partly due to an active galactic nucleus or enhanced carbon abundance. GN-z11 is luminous and young, yet moderately massive, implying a rapid build-up of stellar mass in the past. Future facilities will be able to find the progenitors of such galaxies at higher redshift and probe the cosmic epoch at the beginning of reionization.},

While at fixed {\$}{\{}\backslashrm H\backslashalpha/H\backslashbeta {\}}{\$}, IRX turns out to be independent on galaxy stellar mass, the Balmer decrement does show a strong mass dependence at fixed IRX.

This finding reveals that the nebular attenuation as probed by the Balmer decrement becomes increasingly larger than the global (stellar) attenuation of SFGs with decreasing SSFR surface density. This can be understood in the context of an enhanced fraction of intermediate-age stellar populations that are less attenuated by dust than the HII region-traced young population, in conjunction with a decreasing dust opacity of the diffuse ISM when spreading over a larger spatial extent. Once the SSFR surface density of an SFG is known, the conversion between attenuation of nebular and stellar emission can be well estimated using our scaling relation.},

abstract = {We analyze the monopole in the peculiar velocities of 44 Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to test for a local void. The sample extends from 20 to 300 Mpc/h, with distances, deduced from light-curve shapes, accurate to {\~{}}6{\%}. Assuming Omega{\_}m=1 and Omega{\_}lambda=0, the most significant deviation we find from the Hubble law is an outwards flow of (6.6+/-2.2){\%} inside a sphere of radius 70 Mpc/h as would be produced by a void of {\~{}}20{\%} underdensity surrounded by a dense shell. This shell roughly coincides with the local Great Walls. Monte Carlo analyses, using Gaussian errors or bootstrap resampling, show the probability for chance occurrence of this result out of a pure Hubble flow to be {\~{}}2{\%}. The monopole could be contaminated by higher moments of the velocity field, especially a quadrupole, which are not properly probed by the current limited sky coverage. The void would be less significant if Omega{\_}m is low and Omega{\_}lambda is high. It would be more significant if one outlier is removed from the sample, or if the size of the void is constrained a-priori. This putative void is not in significant conflict with any of the standard cosmological scenarios. It suggests that the Hubble constant as determined within 70 Mpc/h could be overestimated by {\~{}}6{\%} and the local value of Omega may be underestimated by {\~{}}20{\%}. While the present evidence for a local void is marginal in this data set, the analysis shows that the accumulation of SNe Ia distances will soon provide useful constraints on elusive and important aspects of regional cosmic dynamics.},

For emulating spectra, we use principal component analysis to construct a set of basis functions, and neural networks to learn the basis coefficients as a function of the SPS model parameters. For photometry, we parameterize the magnitudes (for the filters of interest) as a function of SPS parameters by a neural network. The resulting emulators are able to predict spectra and photometry under both simple and complicated SPS model parameterizations to percent-level accuracy, giving a factor of {\$}10{\^{}}3{\$}--{\$}10{\^{}}4{\$} speed up over direct SPS computation. They have readily-computable derivatives, making them amenable to gradient-based inference and optimization methods. The emulators are also straightforward to call from a GPU, giving an additional order-of-magnitude speed-up. Rapid SPS computations delivered by emulation offers a massive reduction in the computational resources required to infer the physical properties of galaxies from observed spectra or photometry and simulate galaxy populations under SPS models, whilst maintaining the accuracy required for a range of applications.},

abstract = {We present a new model for computing the spectral evolution of stellar populations at ages between 100,000 yr and 20 Gyr at a resolution of 3 A across the whole wavelength range from 3200 to 9500 A for a wide range of metallicities. These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 A to 160 micron, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally-pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios [abridged].},

In this review, we will discuss the current state of the literature regarding the quenching of galaxies in (proto-)clusters from the observational, infrared perspective.

Now with deeper and more homogeneous near-infrared coverage exploited by the COSMOS2020 catalog, we leverage the large 1.27 deg{\$}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$} effective area to improve sample statistics and understand cosmic variance particularly for rare, massive galaxies and push to higher redshifts with greater confidence and mass completeness than previous studies. We divide the total stellar mass function into star-forming and quiescent sub-samples through {\$}NUVrJ{\$} color-color selection. Measurements are then fitted with Schechter functions to infer the intrinsic SMF, the evolution of its key parameters, and the cosmic stellar mass density out to {\$}z=7.5{\$}. We find a smooth, monotonic evolution in the galaxy SMF since {\$}z=7.5{\$}, in agreement with previous studies. The number density of star-forming systems seems to have undergone remarkably consistent growth spanning four decades in stellar mass from {\$}z=7.5\backslashrightarrow2{\$} whereupon high-mass systems become predominantly quiescent (i.e. downsizing). An excess of massive systems at {\$}z\backslashsim2.5-5.5{\$} with strikingly red colors, some newly identified, increase the observed number densities to the point where the SMF cannot be reconciled with a Schechter function. Systematics including cosmic variance and/or AGN contamination are unlikely to fully explain this excess, and so we speculate that there may be contributions from dust-obscured objects similar to those found in FIR surveys.

We also account for the effect of metallicity by jointly constraining the metallicity and ionisation parameter of each sample. We find an evolution in the ionisation parameter for main-sequence, star-forming galaxies and show that this evolution is driven by the evolution of sSFR. By analysing the matched samples as well as a larger sample of {\$}z{\textless}0.3{\$}, star-forming galaxies we show that high ionisation parameters are directly linked to high sSFRs and are not simply the byproduct of an evolution in metallicity. Our results are physically consistent with the definition of the ionisation parameter, a measure of the hydrogen ionising photon flux relative to the number density of hydrogen atoms.},

We use the Zurich ENvironmental Study (ZENS), which is a survey of galaxy groups with a large fraction of satellite galaxies. QGs shape a narrow locus in the {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}1-M{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\$} plane, which we refer to as {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}1{\$} ridgeline. Colors of ({\$}B-I{\$}) and ({\$}I-J{\$}) are used to divide QGs into three age categories: young ({\$}{\textless}2{\~{}}\backslashmathrm{\{}Gyr{\}}{\$}), intermediate ({\$}2-4{\~{}}\backslashmathrm{\{}Gyr{\}}{\$}), and old ({\$}{\textgreater}4{\~{}}\backslashmathrm{\{}Gyr{\}}{\$}). At fixed stellar mass, old QGs on the {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}1{\$} ridgeline have higher {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}1{\$} than young QGs. This shows that galaxies landing on the {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}1{\$} ridgeline at later epochs arrive with lower {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}1{\$}, which drives the zeropoint of the ridgeline down with time. We compare the present-day zeropoint of the oldest population at {\$}z=0{\$} with the zeropoint of the quiescent population 4 Gyr back in time, at {\$}z=0.37{\$}. These zeropoints are identical, showing that the intrinsic evolution of individual galaxies after they arrive on the {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}1{\$} ridgeline must be negligible, or must evolve parallel to the ridgeline during this interval. The observed evolution of the global zeropoint of 0.07 dex over the last 4 Gyr is thus largely due to the continuous addition of newly quenched galaxies with lower {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}1{\$} at later times ("progenitor bias"). While these results refer to the satellite-rich ZENS sample as a whole, our work suggests a similar age-{\$}\backslashSigma{\_}1{\$} trend for central galaxies.},

abstract = {We report a detailed CO(1-0) survey of a galaxy protocluster field at z = 2.16, based on 475 h of observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array. We constructed a large mosaic of 13 individual pointings, covering an area of 21 arcmin2 and ±6500 km s-1 range in velocity. We obtained a robust sample of 46 CO(1-0) detections spanning z = 2.09 - 2.22, constituting the largest sample of molecular gas measurements in protoclusters to date. The CO emitters show an overdensity at z = 2.12 - 2.21, suggesting a galaxy super-protocluster or a protocluster connected to large-scale filaments of ∼120 cMpc in size. We find that 90{\%} of CO emitters have distances {\textgreater}0.′5-4′ to the center galaxy, indicating that small area surveys would miss the majority of gas reservoirs in similar structures. Half of the CO emitters have velocities larger than escape velocities, which appears gravitationally unbound to the cluster core. These unbound sources are barely found within the R200 radius around the center, which is consistent with a picture in which the cluster core is collapsed while outer regions are still in formation. Compared to other protoclusters, this structure contains a relatively higher number of CO emitters with relatively narrow line widths and high luminosities, indicating galaxy mergers. We used these CO emitters to place the first constraint on the CO luminosity function and molecular gas density in an overdense environment. The amplitude of the CO luminosity function is 1.6 ± 0.5 orders of magnitude higher than that observed for field galaxy samples at z ∼ 2, and one order of magnitude higher than predictions for galaxy protoclusters from semi-analytical SHARK models. We derive a high molecular gas density of 0.6 - 1.3 × 109Mpdbl cMpc-3 for this structure, which is consistent with predictions for cold gas density of massive structures from hydro-dynamical DIANOGA simulations.},

abstract = {We present multi-wave band optical imaging data obtained from observations of the Subaru/XMM-Newton Deep Survey (SXDS). The survey field, centered at R.A.=02h18m00s, decl.=-05deg00'00'', has been the focus of a wide range of multiwavelength observing programs spanning from X-ray to radio wavelengths. A large part of the optical imaging observations are carried out with Suprime-Cam on Subaru Telescope at Mauna Kea in the course of Subaru Telescope ``Observatory Projects.'' This paper describes our optical observations, data reduction and analysis procedures employed, and the characteristics of the data products. A total area of 1.22 deg2 is covered in five contiguous subfields, each of which corresponds to a single Suprime-Cam field of view ({\~{}}34'×27'), in five broadband filters, B, V, Rc, i', and z', to the depths of B=28.4, V=27.8, Rc=27.7, i'=27.7, and z'=26.6, respectively (AB, 3 $\sigma$, $\phi$=2''). The data are reduced and compiled into five multi-wave band photometric catalogs, separately for each Suprime-Cam pointing. The i'-band catalogs contain about 900,000 objects, making the SXDS catalogs one of the largest multi-wave band catalogs in corresponding depth and area coverage. The SXDS catalogs can be used for an extensive range of astronomical applications such as the number density of the Galactic halo stars to the large-scale structures at the distant universe. The number counts of galaxies are derived and compared with those of existing deep extragalactic surveys. The optical data, the source catalogs, and configuration files used to create the catalogs are publicly available via the SXDS Web page (http://www.naoj.org/Science/SubaruProject/SXDS/index.html).

abstract = {Aims. It is still not understood why star-forming galaxies deviate from the ultraviolet colour-attenuation relation of starburst galaxies. Previous work and models hint that the role of the shape of the attenuation curve and the age of stellar populations play an important role. In this paper we aim at understanding the fundamental reasons for this deviation. Methods. We have used the CIGALE spectral energy distribution fitting code to model the far ultraviolet to the far infrared emission of a set of 7 reasonably face-on spiral galaxies from the Herschel Reference Survey on a pixel-by-pixel basis. We explored the influence of a wide range of physical parameters to quantify their influence and impact on any accurate determination of the attenuation from the ultraviolet colour and to discover why normal galaxies do not follow the same relation as starburst galaxies. Results. We have found that the deviation from the starburst relation can be explained best by intrinsic ultraviolet colour differences between different regions in galaxies. Variations in the shape of the attenuation curve can also play a secondary role. Standard age estimators of the stellar populations, such as the D4000 index or the birthrate parameter, prove to be poor predictors of the intrinsic ultraviolet colour. These results are also retrieved on a sample of 58 spiral galaxies drawn from the Herschel Reference Survey sample when considering their integrated fluxes. Conclusions. When correcting the emission of normal star-forming galaxies for the attenuation, it is crucial to consider possible variations in both the intrinsic ultraviolet colour of the stellar populations and the shape of the attenuation curve.},

abstract = {We present an analysis of stellar populations in passive galaxies in seven massive X-ray clusters at z=0.19-0.89. Based on absorption line strengths measured from our high signal-to-noise spectra, the data support primarily passive evolution of the galaxies. We use the scaling relations between velocity dispersions and the absorption line strengths to determine representative mean line strengths for the clusters. From the age determinations based on the line strengths (and stellar population models), we find a formation redshift of z{\_}form=1.96(-0.19,+0.24). Based on line strength measurements from high signal-to-noise composite spectra of our data, we establish the relations between velocity dispersion, ages, metallicities [M/H] and abundance ratios [alpha/Fe] as a function of redshift. The [M/H]-velocity dispersion and [alpha/Fe]-velocity dispersion relations are steep and tight. The age-velocity dispersion relation is flat, with zero point changes reflecting passive evolution. The scatter in all three parameters are within 0.08-0.15 dex at fixed velocity dispersions, indicating a large degree of synchronization in the evolution of the galaxies. We find indication of cluster-to-cluster differences in metallicities and abundance ratios. However, variations in stellar populations with the cluster environment can only account for a very small fraction of the intrinsic scatter in the scaling relations. Thus, within these very massive clusters the main driver of the properties of the stellar populations in passive galaxies appears to be the galaxy velocity dispersion.},

abstract = {We report on an accounting of the star-formation- and accretion-driven energetics of 24 $\mu$m-detected sources in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-North field. For sources having infrared (IR; 8-1000 $\mu$m) luminosities gsim3 × 1012 L sun when derived by fitting local spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to 24 $\mu$m photometry alone, we find these IR luminosity estimates to be a factor of {\~{}}4 times larger than those estimated when the SED fitting includes additional 16 and 70 $\mu$m data (and in some cases mid-IR spectroscopy and 850 $\mu$m data). This discrepancy arises from the fact that high-luminosity sources at z Gt 0 appear to have far- to mid-IR ratios, as well as aromatic feature equivalent widths, typical of lower luminosity galaxies in the local universe. Using our improved estimates for IR luminosity and active galactic nucleus (AGN) contributions, we investigate the evolution of the IR luminosity density versus redshift arising from star formation and AGN processes alone. We find that, within the uncertainties, the total star-formation-driven IR luminosity density is constant between 1.15 {\textless}{\~{}} z {\textless}{\~{}} 2.35, although our results suggest a slightly larger value at z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 2. AGNs appear to account for lsim18{\%} of the total IR luminosity density integrated between 0 {\textless}{\~{}} z {\textless}{\~{}} 2.35, contributing lsim25{\%} at each epoch. Luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs; 1011 L sun {\textless}= L IR {\textless} 1012 L sun) appear to dominate the star formation rate density along with normal star-forming galaxies (L IR {\textless} 1011 L sun) between 0.6 {\textless}{\~{}} z {\textless}{\~{}} 1.15. Once beyond z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 2, the contribution from ultraluminous infrared galaxies (L IR {\textgreater}= 1012 L sun) becomes comparable with that of LIRGs. Using our improved IR luminosity estimates, we find existing calibrations for UV extinction corrections based on measurements of the UV spectral slope typically overcorrect UV luminosities by a factor of {\~{}}2, on average, for our sample of 24 $\mu$m-selected sources; accordingly we have derived a new UV extinction correction more appropriate for our sample.},

QGs are photometrically selected from the latest COSMOS2020 catalog. We conduct the stacking analysis of X-ray images of the Chandra COSMOS Legacy Survey for individually undetected QGs. Thanks to the large sample and deep images, the stacked X-ray signal is significantly detected up to z ∼ 5. The average X-ray luminosity cannot be explained by the X-ray luminosity of X-ray binaries, suggesting that the low-luminosity active galactic nuclei (AGNs) ubiquitously exist in QGs. Moreover, the X-ray AGN luminosity of QGs at z {\textgreater} 1.5 is higher than that of star-forming galaxies (SFGs), derived in the same manner as QGs. The stacking analysis of the VLA-COSMOS images is conducted for the identical sample, and the radio signal for QGs is also detected up to z ∼ 5. We find that the radio AGN luminosity of QGs at z {\textgreater} 1.5 is also higher than SFGs, which is in good agreement with the X-ray analysis. The enhanced AGN activity in QGs suggested by the individual analysis in the X-ray and radio wavelength supports its important role for quenching at high redshift. Their enhanced AGN activity is less obvious at z {\textless} 1.5, which can be interpreted as an increasing role of others at lower redshifts, such as environmental quenching. },

abstract = {We present results on the dust attenuation curve of z{\~{}}2 galaxies using early observations from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey. Our sample consists of 224 star-forming galaxies with nebular spectroscopic redshifts in the range z= 1.36-2.59 and high S/N measurements of, or upper limits on, the H-alpha and H-beta emission lines obtained with Keck/MOSFIRE. We construct composite SEDs of galaxies in bins of specific SFR and Balmer optical depth in order to directly constrain the dust attenuation curve from the UV through near-IR for typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift. Our results imply an attenuation curve that is very similar to the SMC extinction curve at wavelengths redward of 2500 Angstroms. At shorter wavelengths, the shape of the curve is identical to that of the Calzetti relation, but with a lower normalization (R{\_}V). Hence, the new attenuation curve results in SFRs that are {\~{}}20{\%} lower, and log stellar masses that are 0.16 dex lower, than those obtained with the Calzetti attenuation curve. Moreover, we find that the difference in the reddening---and the total attenuation---of the ionized gas and stellar continuum correlates strongly with SFR, such that for dust-corrected SFRs larger than 20 Msun/yr assuming a Chabrier IMF, the nebular emission lines suffer an increasing degree of obscuration relative to the continuum. A simple model that can account for these trends is one in which the UV through optical stellar continuum is dominated by a population of less reddened stars, while the nebular line and bolometric luminosities become increasingly dominated by dustier stellar populations for galaxies with large SFRs, as a result of the increased dust enrichment that accompanies such galaxies. Consequently, UV- and SED-based SFRs may underestimate the total SFR at even modest levels of {\~{}}20 Msun/yr. [Abridged]},

abstract = {We present a combined analysis of rest-frame far-UV (1000-2000 A) and rest-frame optical (3600-7000 A) composite spectra formed from very deep observations of a sample of 30 star-forming galaxies with z=2.4+/-0.1, selected to be representative of the full KBSS-MOSFIRE spectroscopic survey. Since the same massive stars are responsible for the observed FUV continuum and the excitation of the observed nebular emission, a self-consistent stellar population synthesis model must simultaneously match the details of the far-UV stellar+nebular continuum and-- when inserted as the excitation source in photoionization models-- account for all observed nebular emission line ratios. We find that only models including massive star binaries, having low stellar metallicity (Z{\_}*/Z{\_}{\{}sun{\}} {\~{}} 0.1) but relatively high ionized gas-phase oxygen abundances (Z{\_}{\{}neb{\}}/Z{\_}{\{}sun{\}} {\~{}} 0.5), can successfully match all of the observational constraints. We argue that this apparent discrepancy is naturally explained by highly super-solar O/Fe [4-5 times (O/Fe){\_}{\{}sun{\}}], expected for gas whose enrichment is dominated by the products of core-collapse supernovae. Once the correct ionizing spectrum is identified, photoionization models reproduce all of the observed strong emission line ratios, the direct T{\_}e measurement of O/H, and allow accurate measurement of the gas-phase abundance ratios of N/O and C/O -- both of which are significantly sub-solar but, as for O/Fe, are in remarkable agreement with abundance patterns observed in Galactic thick disk, bulge, and halo stars with similar O/H. High nebular excitation is the rule at high-z (and rare at low-z) because of systematically shorter enrichment timescales ({\textless}{\textless}1 Gyr): low Fe/O environments produce harder (and longer-lived) stellar EUV spectra at a given O/H, enhanced by dramatic effects on the evolution of massive star binaries.},

abstract = {The epoch of galaxy assembly from 2 ≤ z ≤ 4 marks a critical stage during the evolution of today's galaxy population. During this period, the star-formation activity in the Universe was at its peak level, and the structural patterns observed among galaxies in the local Universe were not yet in place. A variety of novel techniques have been employed over the past decade to assemble multiwavelength observations of galaxies during this impor-tant epoch. In this primarily observational review, I present a census of the methods used to find distant galaxies and the empirical constraints on their multiwavelength luminosities and colors. I then discuss what is known about the stellar content and past histories of star formation in high-redshift galax-ies; their interstellar contents including dust, gas, and heavy elements; and their structural and dynamical properties. I conclude by considering some of the most pressing and open questions regarding the physics of high-redshift galaxies, which are to be addressed with future facilities. 525},

The magnetic field topology is closely connected to galaxy morphology such that irregular fields are hosted by early-type galaxies, while large-scale, ordered fields are present in disc galaxies.

The radio emission surface brightness profiles of our most massive clusters are in reasonable agreement with VLA measurements of Coma and Perseus. Finally, we discuss the fraction of detected extended radio haloes as a function of virial mass and source count functions for different instruments. Overall our results agree encouragingly well with observations, but a refined analysis requires a more sophisticated treatment of relativistic particles in large-scale galaxy formation simulations.},

abstract = {Using cosmological simulations, we address the properties of high-redshift star-forming galaxies (SFGs) across their main sequence (MS) in the plane of star-formation rate (SFR) versus stellar mass. We relate them to the evolution of galaxies through phases of gas compaction, depletion, possible replenishment, and eventual quenching. We find that the high-SFR galaxies in the upper envelope of the MS are compact, with high gas fractions and short depletion times ("blue nuggets"), while the lower-SFR galaxies in the lower envelope have lower central gas densities, lower gas fractions and longer depletion times, consistent with observed gradients across the MS. Stellar-structure gradients are negligible. The SFGs oscillate about the MS ridge on timescales {\$}\backslashsim0.4{\~{}}t{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}Hubble{\}}{\}}{\$} ({\$}\backslashsim1{\$} Gyr at {\$}z\backslashsim3{\$}). The propagation upwards is due to gas compaction, triggered, e.g., by mergers, counter-rotating streams, and/or violent disc instabilities. The downturn at the upper envelope is due to central gas depletion by peak star formation and outflows while inflow from the shrunken gas disc is suppressed. An upturn at the lower envelope can occur once the extended disc has been replenished by fresh gas and a new compaction can be triggered, namely as long as the replenishment time is shorter than the depletion time. The mechanisms of gas compaction, depletion and replenishment confine the SFGs to the narrow ({\$}\backslashpm0.3{\$} dex) MS. Full quenching occurs in massive haloes ({\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}vir{\}}{\}}{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}11.5{\}}{\~{}}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}) and/or at low redshifts ({\$}z{\textless}3{\$}), where the replenishment time is long compared to the depletion time, explaining the observed bending down of the MS at the massive end.},

abstract = {We present a study of the star-formation rate (SFR)-density relation at z {\~{}} 0.9 using data drawn from the Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey. We find that SFR does depend on environment, but only for intermediate-stellar mass galaxies (10{\^{}}10.1 {\textless} M* / Msol {\textless} 10{\^{}}10.8) wherein the median SFR at the highest densities is 0.2-0.3 dex less than at lower densities at a significance of 4 sigma. Interestingly, mass does not drive SFR; galaxies that are more/less massive have SFRs that vary at most by {\~{}}20{\%} across all environments showing no statistically significant dependence. We further split galaxies into low-redshift (z {\~{}} 0.8) and high-redshift (z {\~{}} 1.05) subsamples and observe nearly identical behavior. We devise a simple toy model to explore possible star-formation histories (SFHs) for galaxies evolving between these redshifts. The key assumption in this model is that star-forming galaxies in a given environment-stellar mass bin can be described as a superposition of two exponential timescales (SFR {\~{}} e{\^{}}(-t/tau)): a long-tau timescale with tau = 4 Gyr to simulate "normal" star-forming galaxies, and a short-tau timescale with free tau (between 0.3 {\textless} tau/Gyr {\textless} 2) to simulate galaxies on a quenching trajectory. In general we find that galaxies residing in low/high environmental densities are more heavily weighted to the long-tau/short-tau pathways respectively, which we argue is a signature of environmental quenching. Furthermore, for intermediate-stellar mass galaxies this transition begins at intermediate-density environments suggesting that environmental quenching is relevant in group-like halos and/or cluster infall regions.},

We select them in the near-IR bands of the COSMOS2015 catalogue, which includes ultra-deep photometry from UltraVISTA-DR2, SPLASH, and Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam. At z{\textgreater} 2.5 we use new precise photometric redshifts with error $\sigma$z = 0.03(1 + z) and an outlier fraction of 12{\%}, estimated by means of the unique spectroscopic sample of COSMOS ({\~{}}100 000 spectroscopic measurements in total, more than one thousand having robust zspec{\textgreater} 2.5). The increased exposure time in the DR2, along with our panchromatic detection strategy, allow us to improve the completeness at high z with respect to previous UltraVISTA catalogues (e.g. our sample is {\textgreater}75{\%} complete at 1010 ℳ and z = 5). We also identify passive galaxies through a robust colour-colour selection, extending their SMF estimate up to z = 4. Our work provides a comprehensive view of galaxy-stellar-mass assembly between z = 0.1 and 6, for the first time using consistent estimates across the entire redshift range. We fit these measurements with a Schechter function, correcting for Eddington bias. We compare the SMF fit with the halo mass function predicted from $\Lambda$CDM simulations, finding that at z{\textgreater} 3 both functions decline with a similar slope in thehigh-mass end. This feature could be explained assuming that mechanisms quenching star formation in massive haloes become less effective at high redshifts; however further work needs to be done to confirm this scenario. Concerning the SMF low-mass end, it shows a progressive steepening as it moves towards higher redshifts, with $\alpha$ decreasing from -1.47+0.02-0.02-1.47-0.02+0.02 at z ≃ 0.1 to -2.11+0.30-0.13-2.11-0.13+0.30 at z ≃ 5. This slope depends on the characterisation of the observational uncertainties, which is crucial to properly remove the Eddington bias. We show that there is currently no consensus on the method to quantify such errors: Different error models result in different best-fit Schechter parameters.},

Gravitational lensing combined with deep HST observations allows us to extend the analysis of the MS down to stellar masses as low as logM/Msun{\~{}}7.5 at z{\textless}{\~{}}4 and logM/Msun{\~{}}8 at higher redshifts, a factor of {\~{}}10 below most previous results. We perform an accurate simulation to take into account the effect of observational uncertainties on the MS and correct for the Eddington bias. This step allows us to reliably measure the MS and in particular its slope. While the normalization increases with redshift, we fit an unevolving and approximately linear slope. We nicely extend to lower masses the results of brighter surveys. Thanks to the large dynamic range in mass and by making use of the simulation, we analyzed any possible mass dependence of the dispersion around the MS. We find tentative evidence that the scatter decreases with increasing stellar masses, suggesting a larger variety of star formation histories in low mass galaxies. This trend agrees with theoretical predictions, and is explained as either a consequence of the smaller number of progenitors of low mass galaxies in a hierarchical scenario and/or of the efficient but intermittent stellar feedback processes in low mass halos. Finally, we observe an increase in the SFR per unit stellar mass with redshift milder than predicted by theoretical models, implying a still incomplete understanding of the processes responsible for galaxy growth.},

Predictions for the JWST MIRI observed galaxy luminosity functions and number counts are given.

As opposed to the consistency in the UV, optical and NIR, we find that TNG, combined with our dust modelling choices, significantly underpredicts the abundance of most dust-obscured and thus most luminous FIR galaxies. As a result, the obscured cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) and the SFRD contributed by optical/NIR dark objects are underpredicted. The discrepancies discovered here could provide new constraints on the sub-grid feedback models, or the dust contents, of simulations. Meanwhile, although the TNG predicted dust temperature and its relations with IR luminosity and redshift are qualitatively consistent with observations, the peak dust temperature of {\$}z\backslashgeq 6{\$} galaxies are overestimated by about {\$}20\backslash,{\{}\backslashrm K{\}}{\$}. This could be related to the limited mass resolution of our simulations to fully resolve the porosity of the interstellar medium (or specifically its dust content) at these redshifts.},

@article{Vulcani2016,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.. The growth of galaxies is a key problem in understanding the structure and evolution of the universe. Galaxies grow their stellar mass by a combination of star formation and mergers, with a relative importance that is redshift dependent. Theoretical models predict quantitatively different contributions from the two channels; measuring these from the data is a crucial constraint. Exploiting the UltraVISTA catalog and a unique sample of progenitors of local ultra-massive galaxies selected with an abundance matching approach, we quantify the role of the two mechanisms from z = 2 to 0. We also compare our results to two independent incarnations of semi-analytic models. At all redshifts, progenitors are found in a variety of environments, ranging from being isolated to having 5-10 companions with mass ratio at least 1:10 within a projected radius of 500 kpc. In models, progenitors have a systematically larger number of companions, entailing a larger mass growth for mergers than in observations, at all redshifts. Generally, in both observations and models, the inferred and the expected mass growth roughly agree, within the uncertainties. Overall, our analysis confirms the model predictions, showing how the growth history of massive galaxies is dominated by in situ star formation at z ∼ 2, both star formation and mergers at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2, and by mergers alone at z {\textless} 1. Nonetheless, detailed comparisons still point out tensions between the expected mass growth and our results, which might be due to either an incorrect progenitors-descendants selection, uncertainties on star-formation rate and mass estimates, or the adopted assumptions on merger rates.},

abstract = {The evolution of galaxy clustering from z = 0 to z ≃ 4.5 is analysed using the angular correlation function and the photometric redshift distribution of galaxies brighter than IAB ≤ 28.5 in the Hubble Deep Field North. The reliability of the photometric redshift estimates is discussed on the basis of the available spectroscopic redshifts, comparing different codes and investigating the effects of photometric errors. The redshift bins in which the clustering properties are measured are then optimized to take into account the uncertainties of the photometric redshifts. The results show that the comoving correlation length r0 has a small decrease in the range 0 ≲ z ≲ 1 followed by an increase at higher z. We compare these results with the theoretical predictions of a variety of cosmological models belonging to the general class of Cold Dark Matter scenarios, including Einstein-de Sitter models, an open model and a flat model with non-zero cosmological constant. Comparison with the expected mass clustering evolution indicates that the observed high-redshift galaxies are biased tracers of the dark matter with an effective bias b strongly increasing with redshift. Assuming an Einstein-de Sitter universe, we obtain b ≃ 2.5 at z ≃ 2 and b ≃ 5 at z ≃ 4. These results support theoretical scenarios of biased galaxy formation in which the galaxies observed at high redshift are preferentially located in more massive haloes. Moreover, they suggest that the usual parameterization of the clustering evolution as $\xi$(r, z) = $\xi$(r, 0)(1 + z)-(3+∈) is not a good description for any value of ∈. Comparison of the clustering amplitudes that we measured at z ≃ 3 with those reported by Adelberger et al. and Giavalisco et al., based on a different selection, suggests that the clustering depends on the abundance of the objects: more abundant objects are less clustered, as expected in the paradigm of hierarchical galaxy formation. The strong clustering and high bias measured at z ≃ 3 are consistent with the expected density of massive haloes predicted in the frame of the various cosmologies considered here. At z ≃ 4, the strong clustering observed in the Hubble Deep Field requires a significant fraction of massive haloes to be already formed by that epoch. This feature could be a discriminant test for the cosmological parameters if confirmed by future observations.},

As a general feature, the IMF is well described by a power-law form for {\$}m\backslashga 1 \backslashmsol{\$} and a lognormal form below. The extension of the disk IMF into the brown dwarf (BD) regime is in good agreement with observations and yields a disk BD number-density comparable to the stellar one {\$}\backslashsim 0.1 \backslashpc3{\$}. The IMF of young clusters is found to be consistent with the disk field IMF, providing the same correction for unresolved binaries. The spheroid IMF relies on much less robust grounds. Within all the uncertainties, it is found to be similar to the one derived for globular clusters, and is well represented also by a lognormal form with a characteristic mass slightly larger than for the disk. The IMF characteristic of early star formation remains undetermined, but different observational constraints suggest that it does not extend below {\$}\backslashsim 1 \backslashmsol{\$}. These IMFs allow a reasonably robust determination of the Galactic present-day and initial stellar and brown dwarf contents. They also have important galactic implications in yielding more accurate mass-to-light ratio determinations. The M/L ratios obtained with the disk and the spheroid IMF yield values 1.8 and 1.4 smaller than a Salpeter IMF, respectively. This general IMF determination is examined in the context of star formation theory. (shortened)},

We investigate their basic physical quantities, such as stellar masses, star formation rates (SFRs), and sizes, using the publicly available multiwavelength data and high-resolution images from the Hubble Space Telescope. The stellar masses and SFRs show a clear correlation known as the "main sequence" of star-forming galaxies. It is found that the location of the main sequence of the [O III] emitters at z = 3.2 and 3.6 is almost identical to that of the H$\alpha$ emitters at z = 2.2 and 2.5. Also, we investigate their mass-size relation and find that the relation does not change between the two epochs. When we assume that the star-forming galaxies at z = 3.2 grow simply along the same main sequence down to z = 2.2, galaxies with M∗ = 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}9{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}-10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}11{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} M{\textless}inf{\textgreater}⊙{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} increase their stellar masses significantly by a factor of 10-2.

abstract = {We present ultra-deep Keck/MOSFIRE rest-optical spectra of two star-forming galaxies at z=2.18 in the COSMOS field with bright emission lines, representing more than 20{\~{}}hours of total integration. The fidelity of these spectra enabled the detection of more than 20 unique emission lines for each galaxy, including the first detection of the auroral [O II]{\$}\backslashlambda\backslashlambda{\$}7322,7332 lines at high redshift. We use these measurements to calculate the electron temperature in the low-ionization O{\$}{\^{}}+{\$} zone of the ionized ISM and derive abundance ratios of O/H, N/H, and N/O using the direct method. The N/O and {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}/Fe abundance patterns of these galaxies are consistent with rapid formation timescales and ongoing strong starbursts, in accord with their high specific star-formation rates. These results demonstrate the feasibility of using auroral [O II] measurements for accurate metallicity studies at high redshift in a higher metallicity regime previously unexplored with the direct method in distant galaxies. These results also highlight the difficulty in obtaining the measurements required for direct-method metallicities from the ground. We emphasize the advantages that the JWST/NIRSpec instrument will bring to high-redshift metallicity studies, where the combination of increased sensitivity and uninterrupted wavelength coverage will yield more than an order of magnitude increase in efficiency for multiplexed auroral-line surveys relative to current ground-based facilities. Consequently, the advent of JWST promises to be the beginning of a new era of precision chemical abundance studies of the early universe at a level of detail rivaling that of local galaxy studies.},

abstract = {We derive H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} fluxes for a large spectroscopic and photometric-redshift-selected sample of sources over GOODS-North and South in the redshift range z = 3.8-5.0 with deep HST, Spitzer/IRAC, and ground-based observations. The H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} flux is inferred based on the offset between the IRAC 3.6 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m flux and that predicted from the best-fit SED. We demonstrate that the H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} flux correlates well with dust- corrected UV star-formation rate (SFR) and therefore can serve as an independent SFR indicator. However, we also find a systematic offset in the SFR{\_}H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}/SFR{\_}UV ratios for z {\~{}} 4-5 galaxies relative to local relations (assuming the same dust corrections for nebular regions and stellar light). We show that we can resolve the modest tension in the inferred SFRs by assuming bluer intrinsic UV slopes (increasing the dust correction), a rising star-formation history or assuming a low metallicity stellar population with a hard ionizing spectrum (increasing the L{\_}H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}/SFR ratio). Using H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} as a SFR indicator, we find a higher normalization of the star formation main sequence compared to recent SED-based determinations and also derive the SFR functions at z {\~{}} 4-8. In addition, we assess for the first time the burstiness of star formation in z {\~{}} 4 galaxies on {\textless}100 Myr time scales by comparing UV and H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}-based sSFRs; their one-to-one relationship argues against significantly bursty star-formation histories. Further progress will be made on these results, by incorporating new results from ALMA to constrain the dust-obscured star formation in high-redshift UV-selected samples.},

(2003). CMAGIC takes advantage of the remarkably simple behavior of Type Ia supernovae on color-magnitude diagrams, and has several advantages over current techniques based on maximum magnitudes. Among these are a reduced sensitivity to host galaxy dust extinction, a shallower luminosity-width relation, and the relative simplicity of the fitting procedure. This allows us to provide a cross check of previous supernova cosmology results, despite the fact that current data sets were not observed in a manner optimized for CMAGIC. We describe the details of our novel blindness procedure, which is designed to prevent experimenter bias. The data are broadly consistent with the picture of an accelerating Universe, and agree with a flat Universe within 1.7$\backslash$sigma, including systematics. We also compare the CMAGIC results directly with those of a maximum magnitude fit to the same SNe, finding that CMAGIC favors more acceleration at the 1.6$\backslash$sigma level, including systematics and the correlation between the two measurements. A fit for w assuming a flat Universe yields a value which is consistent with a cosmological constant within 1.2$\backslash$sigma.},

Based on red-green-blue images using the F115W, F200W and F444W filters, we divide each galaxy in several uniformly colored regions, fit their respective Spectral Energy Distribution and measure dust attenuations, stellar masses, star formation rates and ages. After classifying each region as star-forming or quiescent, we assign galaxies to three classes, depending on whether active star-formation is located in the core, in the disk or in both. (i) {\~{}}70{\%} of our DSFGs have a compact highly dust attenuated star-forming core that can contain up to 80{\%} of the star-formation of the galaxy but only 20-30{\%} of its stellar mass, and is always surrounded by a larger, less attenuated massive disk (no blue nuggets); (ii) 64{\%} (27{\%}) of disks are significantly (strongly) lopsided, likely due to asymmetric cold gas accretion, major mergers and/or large scale instabilities; (iii) 23{\%} of galaxies have a star-forming core embedded in a quiescent disk, they are undergoing outside-in quenching, often facilitated by their strong lopsidedness inducing small and large scale instabilities; (iv) some galaxies host highly heterogeneous disks in term of RGB colors: these are driven by in-homogeneous dust attenuation; and (v) we find surprising evidence for clump-like substructures being quiescent and/or residing in quiescent regions.

While our results confirm that (1) radio-loud AGNs are predominantly hosted by already-quenched and very massive (M∗ {\textgreater} 1011M ) galaxies, ruling out their feedback as a primary driver of M? galaxy quenching, we found that (2) X-ray AGNs affected by heavy obscuration of their soft X-ray emission are mostly hosted by M? galaxies that are in the process of quenching. This is consistent with a quenching scenario that involves mergers of (gas-poor) M? galaxies after the onset of the quenching process, i.e., a scenario where M? galaxy mergers are not the cause but rather an aftermath of the quenching mechanism(s). In that respect, we discuss how our results may support a picture where the slow quenching of M? galaxies happens due to halo-halo mergers along cosmic filaments.},

abstract = {We examine the star formation histories (SFHs) of galaxies in smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations, compare them to parametric models that are commonly used in fitting observed galaxy spectral energy distributions, and examine the efficacy of these parametric models as practical tools for recovering the physical parameters of galaxies. The commonly used tau-model, with SFR {\~{}} exp(-t/tau), provides a poor match to the SFH of our SPH galaxies, with a mismatch between early and late star formation that leads to systematic errors in predicting colours and stellar mass-to-light ratios. A one-parameter lin-exp model, with SFR {\~{}} t*exp(-t/tau), is much more successful on average, but it fails to match the late-time behavior of the bluest, most actively star-forming galaxies and the passive, "red and dead" galaxies. We introduce a 4-parameter model, which transitions from lin-exp to a linear ramp after a transition time, which describes our simulated galaxies very well. We test the ability of these parametrised models to recover (at z=0, 0.5, and 1) the stellar mass-to-light ratios, specific star formation rates, and stellar population ages from the galaxy colours, computed from the full SPH star formation histories using the FSPS code of Conroy et al. (2009). Fits with tau-models systematically overestimate M/L by {\~{}} 0.2 dex, overestimate population ages by {\~{}} 1-2 Gyr, and underestimate sSFR by {\~{}} 0.05 dex. Fits with lin-exp are less biased on average, but the 4-parameter model yields the best results for the full range of galaxies. Marginalizing over the free parameters of the 4-parameter model leads to slightly larger statistical errors than 1-parameter fits but essentially removes all systematic biases, so this is our recommended procedure for fitting real galaxies.},

It is a portfolio of five survey components covering various combinations of the filter set ZYJHK and H{\_}2. The Large Area Survey, the Galactic Clusters Survey, and the Galactic Plane Survey cover approximately 7000 square degrees to a depth of K{\~{}}18; the Deep Extragalactic Survey covers 35 square degrees to K{\~{}}21, and the Ultra Deep Survey covers 0.77 square degrees to K{\~{}}23. Summed together UKIDSS is 12 times larger in effective volume than the 2MASS survey. The prime aim of UKIDSS is to provide a long term astronomical legacy database; the design is however driven by a series of specific goals -- for example to find the nearest and faintest sub-stellar objects; to discover Population II brown dwarfs, if they exist; to determine the substellar mass function; to break the z=7 quasar barrier; to determine the epoch of re-ionisation; to measure the growth of structure from z=3 to the present day; to determine the epoch of spheroid formation; and to map the Milky Way through the dust, to several kpc. The survey data are being uniformly processed, and released in stages through the WFCAM Science Archive (WSA : http://surveys.roe.ac.uk/wsa). Before the formal survey began, UKIRT and the UKIDSS consortium collaborated in obtaining and analysing a series of small science verification (SV) projects to complete the commissioning of the camera. We show some results from these SV projects in order to demonstrate the likely power of the eventual complete survey. Finally, using the data from the First Data Release we assess how well UKIDSS is meeting its design targets so far.},

From the UKIDSS Ultra-Deep Survey Data Release 1, with matched optical and mid-IR photometry taken from the Subaru XMM Deep Survey and Spitzer Wide-Area Infrared Extragalactic Survey respectively, we construct a K-selected galaxy catalog and calculate photometric redshifts. Excluding stars, objects with uncertain z{\_}phot solutions, those that fall in bad or incomplete survey regions, and those for which reliable rest-frame colors could not be derived, 30108 galaxies with K{\textless}22.4 (AB) and z{\textless}2.5 remain. The galaxies in this sample are found to occupy two distinct populations in the rest-frame U-V vs. V-J color space: a clump of red, quiescent galaxies (analogous to the red sequence) and a track of star-forming galaxies extending from blue to red U-V colors. This bimodal behavior is seen up to z{\~{}}2. Due to a combination of measurement errors and passive evolution, the color-color diagram is not suitable to distinguish the galaxy bimodality at z{\textgreater}2 for this sample, but we show that MIPS 24um data suggest that a significant population of quiescent galaxies exists even at these higher redshifts. At z=1-2, the most luminous objects in the sample are divided roughly equally between star-forming and quiescent galaxies, while at lower redshifts most of the brightest galaxies are quiescent. Moreover, quiescent galaxies at these redshifts are clustered more strongly than those actively forming stars, indicating that galaxies with early-quenched star formation may occupy more massive host dark matter halos. This suggests that the end of star formation is associated with, and perhaps brought about by, a mechanism related to halo mass.},

abstract = {Emission line diagnostic diagrams probing the ionization sources in galaxies, such as the Baldwin-Phillips-Terlevich (BPT) diagram, have been used extensively to distinguish active galactic nuclei (AGN) from purely star-forming galaxies. However, they remain poorly understood at higher redshifts. We shed light on this issue with an empirical approach based on a z 0 reference sample built from 00,000 Sloan Digital Sky Survey galaxies, from which we mimic selection effects due to typical emission line detection limits at higher redshift. We combine this low-redshift reference sample with a simple prescription for luminosity evolution of the global galaxy population to predict the loci of high-redshift galaxies on the BPT and Mass-Excitation (MEx) diagnostic diagrams. The predicted bivariate distributions agree remarkably well with direct observations of galaxies out to z 1.5, including the observed stellar mass-metallicity (MZ) relation evolution. As a result, we infer that high-redshift star-forming galaxies are consistent with having normal interstellar medium (ISM) properties out to z 1.5, after accounting for selection effects and line luminosity evolution. Namely, their optical line ratios and gas-phase metallicities are comparable to that of low-redshift galaxies with equivalent emission-line luminosities. In contrast, AGN narrow-line regions may show a shift toward lower metallicities at higher redshift. While a physical evolution of the ISM conditions is not ruled out for purely star-forming galaxies and may be more important starting at z ≳ 2, we find that reliably quantifying this evolution is hindered by selections effects. The recipes provided here may serve as a basis for future studies toward this goal.

abstract = {The environment is known to affect the formation and evolution of galaxies considerably best visible through the well-known morphology-density relationship. It is less clear, though, whether the environment is equally important at a given galaxy morphology. In this paper, we study the effect of environment on the evolution of early-type galaxies as imprinted in the fossil record by analysing the stellar population properties of 3360 galaxies morphologically selected by visual inspection from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey in a narrow redshift range (0.05 ≤z ≤ 0.06). The morphological selection algorithm is critical, as it does not bias against recent star formation. We find that the distribution of ages is bimodal with a strong peak at old ages and a secondary peak at young ages around ∼2.5 Gyr containing about 10 per cent of the objects. This is an analogue to 'red sequence' and 'blue cloud' identified in galaxy populations usually containing both early- and late-type galaxies. The fraction of the young, rejuvenated galaxies increases with both decreasing galaxy mass and decreasing environmental density up to about 45 per cent, which implies that the impact of environment increases with decreasing galaxy mass. The rejuvenated galaxies have lower $\alpha$/Fe ratios than the average and most of them show signs of ongoing star formation through their emission line spectra. All objects that host active galactic nuclei in their centres without star formation are part of the red sequence population. We confirm and statistically strengthen earlier results that luminosity weighted ages, metallicities and $\alpha$/Fe element ratios of the red sequence population correlate well with velocity dispersion and galaxy mass. Most interestingly, however, these scaling relations are not sensitive to environmental densities and are only driven by galaxy mass. We infer that early-type galaxy formation has undergone a phase transition a few billion years ago around z ∼ 0.2. A self-regulated formation phase without environmental dependence has recently been superseded by a rejuvenation phase, in which the environment plays a decisive role possibly through galaxy mergers and interactions. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {Aims: We aim to investigate the effect of the escaping ionizing radiation on the color selection of high-redshift galaxies and identify candidate Lyman-continuum (LyC) emitters. Methods: We used the intergalactic medium (IGM) prescription of Inoue et al. (2014, MNRAS, 442, 1805) and galaxy synthesis models of Bruzual {\&} Charlot (2003, MNRAS, 344, 1000) to properly treat the ultraviolet stellar emission and the stochasticity of the intergalactic transmission and mean free path in the ionizing regime. Color tracks were computed by turning the escape fraction fesc of ionizing radiation on or off. Results: At variance with recent studies, a careful treatment of IGM transmission leads to no significant effects on the high-redshift broad-band color selection, even adopting the most extreme ionizing emission model (with an age of 1 Myr, zero dust, and metallicity Z/Z{\&}sun; = 0.02). The decreasing mean free path of ionizing photons with increasing redshift further diminishes the contribution of the LyC to broad-band colors. We demonstrate that prominent LyC sources can be selected under suitable conditions by calculating the probability of a null escaping ionizing radiation. This was performed by running ad hoc Monte Carlo simulations anchored to the observed photometry, exploring the stochasticity of the IGM, and comparing the simulated and observed colors that encompass the Lyman edge. The method was applied to a sample of galaxies extracted from the GOODS-S field. A known LyC source at z = 3.795 was successfully recovered as a LyC-emitter candidate, and another convincing candidate at z = 3.212 is reported. A detailed analysis of the two sources (including their variability and morphology) suggests a possible mixture of stellar and non-stellar (AGN) contribution in the ultraviolet. Conclusions: The classical broad-band color selection of 2.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 4.5 galaxies does not prevent the inclusion of LyC emitters in the selected samples. High fesc in relatively bright galaxies (L {\textgreater} 0.1L*) could be favored by the presence of a faint active galactic nucleus (AGN) that is not easily detected at any wavelength. A hybrid stellar and non-stellar (AGN) ionizing emission could coexist in these systems and explain the tensions found among the UV excess and the stellar population synthesis models reported in literature.},

abstract = {The South Pole Telescope has discovered one hundred gravitationally lensed, high-redshift, dusty, star-forming galaxies (DSFGs). We present 0.5" resolution 870um Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array imaging of a sample of 47 DSFGs spanning z=1.9-5.7, and construct gravitational lens models of these sources. Our visibility-based lens modeling incorporates several sources of residual interferometric calibration uncertainty, allowing us to properly account for noise in the observations. At least 70{\%} of the sources are strongly lensed by foreground galaxies (mu{\_}870um {\textgreater} 2), with a median magnification mu{\_}870um = 6.3, extending to mu{\_}870um {\textgreater} 30. We compare the intrinsic size distribution of the strongly lensed sources to a similar number of unlensed DSFGs and find no significant differences in spite of a bias between the magnification and intrinsic source size. This may indicate that the true size distribution of DSFGs is relatively narrow. We use the source sizes to constrain the wavelength at which the dust optical depth is unity and find this wavelength to be correlated with the dust temperature. This correlation leads to discrepancies in dust mass estimates of a factor of 2 compared to estimates using a single value for this wavelength. We investigate the relationship between the [CII] line and the far-infrared luminosity and find that the same correlation between the [CII]L{\_}FIR ratio and Sigma{\_}FIR found for low-redshift star-forming galaxies applies to high-redshift galaxies and extends at least two orders of magnitude higher in Sigma{\_}FIR. This lends further credence to the claim that the compactness of the IR-emitting region is the controlling parameter in establishing the "[CII] deficit."},

abstract = {While we observe a large amount of cold interstellar gas and dust in a subset of the early-type galaxy (ETG) population, the source of this material remains unclear. The two main, competing scenarios are external accretion of lower mass, gas-rich dwarfs and internal production from stellar mass loss and/or cooling from the hot interstellar medium (ISM). We test these hypotheses with measurements of the stellar and nebular metallicities of three ETGs (NGC 2768, NGC 3245, and NGC 4694) from new long-slit, high signal-to-noise ratio spectroscopy from the Multi-Object Double Spectographs (MODs) on the Large Binocular Telescope (LBT). These ETGs have modest star formation rates and minimal evidence of nuclear activity. We model the stellar continuum to derive chemical abundances and measure gas-phase abundances with standard nebular diagnostics. We find that the stellar and gas-phase abundances are very similar, which supports internal production and is very inconsistent with the accretion of smaller, lower metallicity dwarfs. All three of these galaxies are also consistent with an extrapolation of the mass-metallicity relation to higher mass galaxies with lower specific star formation rates. The emission line flux ratios along the long-slit, as well as global line ratios clearly indicate that photoionization dominates and ionization by alternate sources including AGN activity, shocks, cosmic rays, dissipative magnetohydrodynamic waves, and single degenerate Type Ia supernovae progenitors do not significantly affect the line ratios.},

abstract = {The development of two-dimensional (2D) bulge-to-disk decomposition techniques has shown their advantages over traditional one-dimensional (1D) techniques, especially for galaxies with non-axisymmetric features. However, the full potential of 2D techniques has yet to be fully exploited. Secondary morphological features in nearby disk galaxies, such as bars, lenses, rings, disk breaks, and spiral arms, are seldom accounted for in 2D image decompositions, even though some image-fitting codes, such as GALFIT, are capable of handling them. We present detailed, 2D multi-model and multi-component decomposition of high-quality {\$}R{\$}-band images of a representative sample of nearby disk galaxies selected from the Carnegie-Irvine Galaxy Survey, using the latest version of GALFIT. The sample consists of five barred and five unbarred galaxies, spanning Hubble types from S0 to Sc. Traditional 1D decomposition is also presented for comparison. In detailed case studies of the 10 galaxies, we successfully model the secondary morphological features. Through a comparison of best-fit parameters obtained from different input surface brightness models, we identify morphological features that significantly impact bulge measurements. We show that nuclear and inner lenses/rings and disk breaks must be properly taken into account to obtain accurate bulge parameters, whereas outer lenses/rings and spiral arms have a negligible effect. We provide an optimal strategy to measure bulge parameters of typical disk galaxies, as well as prescriptions to estimate realistic uncertainties of them, which will benefit subsequent decomposition of a larger galaxy sample.},

Utilizing the “Drift And SHift” observing technique for HST-WFC3 imaging, the COSMOS-DASH survey imaged approximately 0.5 deg 2 of the UltraVISTA deep stripes (0.7 deg 2 , when combined with archival data). Global structural parameters are measured for 51,586 galaxies within COSMOS-DASH using GALFIT (excluding the CANDELS area) with detection using a deep multi-band HST image. We recover consistent results with those from the deeper 3D-HST morphological catalogs, finding that, in general, sizes and S{\'{e}}rsic indices of typical galaxies are accurate to limiting magnitudes of H 160 {\textless} 23 and H 160 {\textless} 22 ABmag, respectively. In size-mass parameter space, galaxies in COSMOS-DASH demonstrate robust morphological measurements out to z ∼ 2 and down to      log (   M   ⋆    /    M   ⊙   ) ∼ 9    . With the advantage of the larger area of COSMOS-DASH, we measure a flattening of the quiescent size-mass relation below      log (   M   ⋆    /    M   ⊙   ) ∼ 10.5    that persists out to z ∼ 2. We show that environment is not the primary driver of this flattening, at least out to z = 1.2, whereas internal physical processes may instead govern the structural evolution. },

abstract = {Despite decades of study, we still do not fully understand why some massive galaxies abruptly switch off their star formation in the early Universe, and what causes their rapid transition to the red sequence. Post-starburst galaxies provide a rare opportunity to study this transition phase, but few have currently been spectroscopically identified at high redshift ({\$}z{\textgreater}1{\$}). In this paper we present the spectroscopic verification of a new photometric technique to identify post-starbursts in high-redshift surveys. The method classifies the broad-band optical-near--infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies using three spectral shape parameters (super-colours), derived from a principal component analysis of model SEDs. When applied to the multiwavelength photometric data in the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey (UDS), this technique identified over 900 candidate post-starbursts at redshifts {\$}0.5{\textless}z{\textless}2.0{\$}. In this study we present deep optical spectroscopy for a subset of these galaxies, in order to confirm their post-starburst nature. Where a spectroscopic assessment was possible, we find the majority (19/24 galaxies; {\~{}}80 per cent) exhibit the strong Balmer absorption (H {\$}\backslashdelta{\$} equivalent width {\$}W{\_}{\{}\backslashlambda{\}}{\$} {\textgreater}5 Ang.) and Balmer break, characteristic of post-starburst galaxies. We conclude that photometric methods can be used to select large samples of recently-quenched galaxies in the distant Universe.},

While the global photometry and spatially-resolved outskirts of MRG-S0851 imply an early-formation scenario with a slowly decreasing or constant star-formation history, a joint fit of 2D grism spectroscopy and photometry reveals a more complex scenario: MRG-S0851 is likely to be experiencing a centrally-concentrated rejuvenation in the inner {\$}\backslashsim{\$}1 kpc in the last {\$}\backslashsim{\$}100 Myr of evolution.

abstract = {The study of cosmology, galaxy formation and exoplanetary systems has now advanced to a stage where a cosmic inventory of terrestrial planets may be attempted. By coupling semi-analytic models of galaxy formation to a recipe that relates the occurrence of planets to the mass and metallicity of their host stars, we trace the population of terrestrial planets around both solar-mass (FGK type) and lower-mass (M dwarf) stars throughout all of cosmic history. We find that the mean age of terrestrial planets in the local Universe is {\$}8\backslashpm1{\$} Gyr and that the typical planet of this type is located in a spheroid-dominated galaxy with total stellar mass about twice that of the Milky Way. We estimate that hot Jupiters have depleted the population of terrestrial planets around FGK stars at redshift {\$}z=0{\$} by no more than {\$}\backslashapprox 10\backslash{\%}{\$}, and predict that {\$}\backslashapprox 1/3{\$} of the terrestrial planets in the local Universe are orbiting stars in a metallicity range for which such planets have yet to be been detected.

We use CANDELS HST catalogues, ultra-deep {\$}Ks{\$} data and new IRAC photometry, performing spectral energy distribution fitting using models with abruptly quenched star formation histories. We then single out galaxies which are best fitted by a passively evolving model, and having only low probability {\$}( {\textless} 5 \backslash{\%}){\$} star-forming solutions. We verify the effects of including nebular lines emission, and we consider possible solutions at different redshifts. The number of selected sources dramatically depends on the models used in the SED fitting. Without including emission lines and with photometric redshifts fixed at the CANDELS estimate, we single out 30 candidates; the inclusion of nebular lines emission reduces the sample to 10 objects; allowing for solutions at different redshifts, only 2 galaxies survive as robust candidates. Most of the candidates are not far-infrared emitters, corroborating their association with passive galaxies. Our results translate into an upper limit in the number density of {\$}\backslashsim 0.173{\$} arcmin{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} above the detection limit. However, we conclude that the selection of passive galaxies at {\$}z{\textgreater}3{\$} is still subject to significant uncertainties, being sensitive to assumptions in the SED modeling adopted and to the relatively low S/N of the objects.

Average CO+[CI] spectral line energy distributions indicate higher excitation in compacts relative to extended sources.

These results are consistent with a picture in which mergers have driven the gas in the nuclear regions, enhancing the CO excitation and star formation efficiency. We suggest that the sub-millimetre compactness, defined as the ratio between the molecular gas and stellar size, is an unavoidable information to be used with the main sequence offset to describe the ISM properties of galaxies, at least above {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}} \backslashgeqslant 10{\^{}}{\{}10.6{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, where our observations fully probe the main sequence scatter.

abstract = {Recent work has shown that the star formation (SF) density relation - in which galaxies with low SF rates are preferentially found in dense environments - is still in place at z ∼ 1, but the situation becomes less clear at higher redshifts. We use mass-selected samples drawn from the UKIDSS Ultra-Deep Survey to show that galaxies with quenched SF tend to reside in dense environments out to at least z ∼ 1.8. Over most of this redshift range we are able to demonstrate that this SF-density relation holds even at fixed stellar mass. The environmental quenching of SF appears to operate with similar efficiency on all galaxies regardless of stellar mass. Nevertheless, the environment plays a greater role in the buildup of the red sequence at lower masses, whereas other quenching processes dominate at higher masses. In addition to a statistical analysis of environmental densities, we investigate a cluster at z = 1.6, and show that the central region has an elevated fraction of quiescent objects relative to the field. Although the uncertainties are large, the environmental quenching efficiency in this cluster is consistent with that of galaxy groups and clusters at z ∼ 0. In this work we rely on photometric redshifts and describe some of the pitfalls that large redshift errors can present. {\textcopyright} 2012. The American Astronomical Society.

We find a clear positive relation between [$\alpha$/Fe] and velocity dispersion. Zero-point, slope, and scatter of this correlation are the same for cluster and field galaxies. In particular, the [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios and mean ages of cluster ellipticals are positively correlated. This strongly reinforces the view that the [$\alpha$/Fe] element enhancement in ellipticals is produced by star formation timescales rather than by variations of the initial mass function. These results indicate that the more massive the galaxy, the shorter is its star formation timescale, and the higher is the redshift of the bulk of star formation. This finding is not compatible with the predictions from models of hierarchical galaxy formation. The lenticular and field galaxies of the investigated sample do not follow the correlation between age and [$\alpha$/Fe], but contain a non-negligible fraction of galaxies with young average ages and high [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios.},

Type Ia supernovae also provide the most powerful observational tool currently available for studying the expansion history of the Universe and the nature of dark energy. Our basic knowledge of supernovae comes from the study of their photometric and spectroscopic properties. However, the presently available data sets of optical and near-infrared light curves of supernovae are rather small and/or heterogeneous, and employ photometric systems that are poorly characterized. Similarly, there are relatively few supernovae whose spectral evolution has been well sampled, both in wavelength and phase, with precise spectrophotometric observations. The low-redshift portion of the Carnegie Supernova Project (CSP) seeks to remedy this situation by providing photometry and spectrophotometry of a large sample of supernovae taken on telescope/filter/detector systems that are well understood and well characterized. During a five-year program which began in September 2004, we expect to obtain high-precision u'g'r'i'BVYJHKs light curves and optical spectrophotometry for about 250 supernovae of all types. In this paper we provide a detailed description of the CSP survey observing and data reduction methodology. In addition, we present preliminary photometry and spectra obtained for a few representative supernovae during the first observing campaign.},

abstract = {We use a sample of 121 spectroscopically normal Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) to show that their intrinsic color is correlated with their ejecta velocity, as measured from the blueshift of the Si II 6355 feature near maximum brightness, v{\_}Si. The SN Ia sample was originally used by Wang et al. (2009) to show that the relationship between color excess and peak magnitude, which in the absence of intrinsic color differences describes a reddening law, was different for two subsamples split by v{\_}Si (defined as "Normal" and "High-Velocity"). We verify this result, but find that the two subsamples have the same reddening law when extremely reddened events (E(B-V) {\textgreater} 0.35 mag) are excluded. We also show that (1) the High-Velocity subsample is offset by {\~{}}0.06 mag to the red from the Normal subsample in the (B{\_}max - V{\_}max) - M{\_}V plane, (2) the B{\_}max - V{\_}max cumulative distribution functions of the two subsamples have nearly identical shapes, but the High-Velocity subsample is offset by {\~{}}0.07 mag to the red in B{\_}max - V{\_}max, and (3) the bluest High-Velocity SNe Ia are {\~{}}0.10 mag redder than the bluest Normal SNe Ia. Together, this evidence indicates a difference in intrinsic color for the subsamples. Accounting for this intrinsic color difference reduces the scatter in Hubble residuals from 0.190 mag to 0.130 mag for SNe Ia with A{\_}V {\textless} 0.7 mag. The scatter can be further reduced to 0.109 mag by exclusively using SNe Ia from the Normal subsample. Additionally, this result can at least partially explain the anomalously low values of R{\_}V found in large SN Ia samples. We explain the correlation between ejecta velocity and color as increased line blanketing in the High-Velocity SNe Ia, causing them to become redder. We discuss some implications of this result, and stress the importance of spectroscopy for future SN Ia cosmology surveys, with particular focus on the design of WFIRST.},

abstract = {We present deep 3.6 - 8 micron imaging of the Hubble Deep Field South with IRAC on the Spitzer Space Telescope. We study Distant Red Galaxies (DRGs) at z{\textgreater}2 selected by Js - Ks {\textgreater} 2.3 and compare them to a sample of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at z=2-3. The observed UV-to-8 micron spectral energy distributions are fit with stellar population models to constrain star formation histories and derive stellar masses. We find that 70{\%} of the DRGs are best described by dust-reddened star forming models and 30{\%} are very well fit with old and ``dead'' models. Using only the I - Ks and Ks - 4.5 micron colors we can effectively separate the two groups. The dead systems are among the most massive at z{\~{}}2.5 (mean stellar mass {\textless}M*{\textgreater} = 0.8 x 10{\^{}}11 Msun) and likely formed most of their stellar mass at z{\textgreater}5. To a limit of 0.5 x 10{\^{}}11 Msun their number density is {\~{}}10 x lower than that of local early-type galaxies. Furthermore, we use the IRAC photometry to derive rest-frame near-infrared J, H, and K fluxes. The DRGs and LBGs together show a large variation (a factor of 6) in the rest-frame K-band mass-to-light ratios (M/L{\_}K), implying that even a Spitzer 8 micron-selected sample would be very different from a mass-selected sample. The average M/L{\_}K of the DRGs is about three times higher than that of the LBGs, and DRGs dominate the high-mass end. The M/L{\_}K ratios and ages of the two samples appear to correlate with derived stellar mass, with the most massive galaxies being the oldest and having the highest mass-to-light ratios, similar as found in the low-redshift universe.},

@article{Rodighiero2007,
abstract = {Context. The identification and characterisation of massive galaxies over a wide redshift range allow us to place stringent constraints on the cosmic history of galaxy mass assembly and on current models of galaxy formation and evolution. Aims. This work explores the existence of high-redshift massive galaxies unveiled with Spitzer+IRAC, but missed by conventional selection techniques based on optical and near-infrared observations. Methods. To this end, we used multi-wavelength imaging data available for the GOODS-South field (130 arcmin 2 ) and selected a flux-limited sample from the IRAC 3.6 $\mu$m image to S 3.6 ≥ 1.8 $\mu$Jy (m(AB) {\textless} 23.26). In order to identify the most extreme objects and to complement previously published selections in this field, we confined our study to the galaxies undetected by the optical HST+ACS imaging and close to the detection limit of the K-band image (K {\textgreater} 23.5 AB). Our selection unveiled 20 galaxies on which we performed a detailed analysis. For each galaxy, we built a spectral energy distribution (SED) based on optical-to-8$\mu$m photometry. The SEDs were then used to estimate the photometric redshifts and to derive the main galaxies' physical properties. Further constraints were also obtained from the available X-ray and 24 $\mu$m data. Results. The majority of the sample (14 out of 20) sources show degenerate/bimodal solutions for the photometric redshifts. These can either be heavily dust-enshrouded (Av ∼ 2-4) starbursts at 2 {\textless} z {\textless} 3 with bolometric luminosities L IR {\textgreater} 10 12 L ⊙ , or massive post-starburst galaxies in the redshift interval 4 {\textless} z {\textless} 9 with stellar masses of ∼10 11 M ⊙ . The remaining six galaxies present a less ambiguous photometric redshift: with the exception of one low-z dusty source, these latter objects favour a low-extinction solution, with four of them showing best-fit photo-z solutions at z ∼ 4. One galaxy, ID-6, the only source in our sample with both an X-ray and a 24 $\mu$ detection, might be an extremely massive object at {\ae} ∼ 8 detected during a post-starburst phase with concomitant QSO activity responsible for the 24 $\mu$m and X-ray emissions (although a lower-z solution is not excluded). Conclusions. Our investigation of Spitzer-selected galaxies that have very red SEDs and completely undetected in the optical reveals a potential population of massive galaxies at z ≥ 4, which appear to include significant AGN emissions. These sources may be the oldest stellar systems at z ∼ 4, given that the estimated ages are close to the age of the Universe at that redshift. We found that these, previously unrecognised, optically obscured objects might provide an important contribution to the massive end (M {\textgreater} 10 11 M ⊙ ) of the high-z stellar mass function, and they would almost double it. Our evidence in these mature high-z galaxies of the widespread presence of hidden AGNs may have important implications for galaxy formation, due to their feedback effects on the surrounding ISM. {\textcopyright} ESO 2007.},

abstract = {Deep near-infrared imaging surveys allow us to select and study distant galaxies in the rest-frame optical, and have transformed our understanding of the early Universe. As the vast majority of K- or IRAC-selected galaxies are too faint for spectroscopy, the interpretation of these surveys relies almost exclusively on photometric redshifts determined from fitting templates to the broadband photometry. The best-achieved accuracy of these redshifts, Dz/(1+z)≳0.06$\Delta$z/(1 + z) ≳ 0.06 at z{\textgreater}1.5, is sufficient for determining the broad characteristics of the galaxy population but not for measuring accurate rest-frame colors, stellar population parameters, or the local galaxy density. We have started a near-infrared imaging survey with the NEWFIRM camera on the Kitt Peak 4-m telescope to greatly improve the accuracy of photometric redshifts in the range 1.5≲z≲3.5. The survey uses five medium-bandwidth filters, which provide crude "spectra" over the wavelength range 1-1.8 $\mu$m for all objects in the 27.6'×27.6' NEWFIRM field. In this first paper, we illustrate the technique by showing medium-band NEWFIRM photometry of several galaxies at 1.7{\textless}z{\textless}2.7 from the recent near-infrared spectroscopic sample of Kriek et al.. The filters unambiguously pinpoint the location of the redshifted Balmer break in these galaxies, enabling very accurate redshift measurements. The full survey will provide similar data for ˜8000 faint K-selected galaxies at z{\textgreater}1.5 in the COSMOS and AEGIS fields. The filter set also enables efficient selection of exotic objects such as high-redshift quasars, galaxies dominated by emission lines, and very cool brown dwarfs; we show that late T and candidate Y dwarfs could be identified using only two of the filters.},

abstract = {Context. The interaction of the light from astronomical objects with the constituents of the Earth's atmosphere leads to the formation of telluric absorption lines in ground-based collected spectra. Correcting for these lines, mostly affecting the red and infrared region of the spectrum, usually relies on observations of specific stars obtained close in time and airmass to the science targets, therefore using precious observing time.  Aims: We present molecfit, a tool to correct for telluric absorption lines based on synthetic modelling of the Earth's atmospheric transmission. Molecfit is versatile and can be used with data obtained with various ground-based telescopes and instruments.  Methods: Molecfit combines a publicly available radiative transfer code, a molecular line database, atmospheric profiles, and various kernels to model the instrument line spread function. The atmospheric profiles are created by merging a standard atmospheric profile representative of a given observatory's climate, of local meteorological data, and of dynamically retrieved altitude profiles for temperature, pressure, and humidity. We discuss the various ingredients of the method, its applicability, and its limitations. We also show examples of telluric line correction on spectra obtained with a suite of ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) instruments.  Results: Compared to previous similar tools, molecfit takes the best results for temperature, pressure, and humidity in the atmosphere above the observatory into account. As a result, the standard deviation of the residuals after correction of unsaturated telluric lines is frequently better than 2{\%} of the continuum.  Conclusions: Molecfit is able to accurately model and correct for telluric lines over a broad range of wavelengths and spectral resolutions. The accuracy reached is comparable to or better than the typical accuracy achieved using a telluric standard star observation. The availability of such a general tool for telluric absorption correction may improve future observational and analysing strategies, as well as empower users of archival data.

abstract = {We describe an algorithm for identifying ellipsoidal haloes in numerical simulations, and quantify how the resulting estimates of halo mass and shape differ with respect to spherical halo finders. Haloes become more prolate when fit with ellipsoids, the difference being most pronounced for the more aspherical objects. Although the ellipsoidal mass is systematically larger, this is less than 10 per cent for most of the haloes. However, even this small difference in mass corresponds to a significant difference in shape. We quantify these effects also on the initial mass and deformation tensors, on which most models of triaxial collapse are based.By studying the properties of protohaloes in the initial conditions, we find that models in which protohaloes are identified in Lagrangian space by three positive eigenvalues of the deformation tensor are tenable only at the masses well above M*. The overdensity $\delta$ within almost any protohalo is larger than the critical value associated with spherical collapse (increasing as mass decreases); this is in good qualitative agreement with models which identify haloes requiring that collapse has occurred along all three principal axes, each axis having turned around from the universal expansion at a different time. The distributions of initial values are in agreement with the simplest predictions associated with ellipsoidal collapse, assuming initially spherical protohaloes, collapsed around random positions which were sufficiently overdense.However, most protohaloes are not spherical and departures from sphericity increase as protohalo mass decreases. The mass and deformation tensors are well aligned, in agreement with the fundamental assumption of ellipsoidal collapse, and with models which identify haloes with peaks in the initial density fluctuation field. But the direction of maximum initial compression coincides with the direction of what is initially the longest axis, contrary to what the peaks model predicts. By the final time, it is the shortest axis of the final object which tends to be aligned with the direction of initial maximal compression: the alignment changes during the evolution. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors.

abstract = { We present the average gas properties derived from Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 dust continuum imaging of 126 massive (log M ⋆ / M ⊙ ≳ 10.5), star-forming cluster galaxies across 11 galaxy clusters at z = 1–1.75. Using stacking analysis on the ALMA images, combined with UV–far-infrared data, we quantify the average infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and gas properties (molecular gas masses, M mol ;gas depletion timescales, $\tau$ depl ; and gas fractions, f gas ) as functions of cluster-centric radius and properties including stellar mass and distance from the main sequence. We find a significant dearth in the ALMA fluxes relative to that expected in the field—with correspondingly low M mol and f gas , and short $\tau$ depl —with weak or no dependence on cluster-centric radius out to twice the virial radius. The Herschel+ALMA SEDs indicate warmer dust temperatures (∼36–38 K) than coeval field galaxies (∼30 K). We perform a thorough comparison of the cluster galaxy gas properties to field galaxies, finding deficits of 2–3×, 3–4×, and 2–4× in M mol , $\tau$ depl , and f gas compared to coeval field stacks, and larger deficits compared to field scaling relations built primarily on detections. The cluster gas properties derived here are comparable with stacking analyses of (proto-)clusters in the literature, and at odds with findings of field-like $\tau$ depl and enhanced f gas reported using CO and dust continuum detections. Our analysis suggests that environment has a considerable impact on gas properties out to large radii, in good agreement with cosmological simulations which project that gas depletion begins beyond the virial radius and largely completes by first passage of the cluster core. },

abstract = {We study the correlation between galaxy structure and the quenching of star formation using a sample of Sloan Digital Sky Survey central galaxies with stellar masses 9.75 {\textless} log M * /M {\textless} 11.25 and redshifts z {\textless} 0.075. Galaxy Evolution Explorer UV data are used to cleanly divide the sample into star-forming and quenched galaxies and to identify galaxies in transition (the green valley). Despite a stark difference in visual appearance between blue and red galaxies, their average radial stellar mass density profiles are remarkably similar (especially in the outer regions) at fixed mass. The inner stellar mass surface density within a radius of 1 kpc, $\Sigma$ 1 , is used to quantify the growth of the bulge as galaxies evolve. When galaxies are divided into narrow mass bins, their distribution in the color-$\Sigma$ 1 plane at fixed mass forms plausible evolutionary tracks. $\Sigma$ 1 seems to grow as galaxies evolve through the blue cloud, and once it crosses a threshold value, galaxies are seen to quench at fixed $\Sigma$ 1 . The $\Sigma$ 1 threshold for quenching grows with stellar mass, $\Sigma$ 1 ∝ M 0.64 * . However, the existence of some star-forming galaxies above the threshold $\Sigma$ 1 implies that a dense bulge is necessary but not sufficient to quench a galaxy fully. This would be consistent with a two-step quenching process in which gas within a galaxy is removed or stabilized against star formation by bulge-driven processes (such as a starburst, active galactic nucleus feedback, or morphological quenching), whereas external gas accretion is suppressed by separate halo-driven processes (such as halo gas shock heating). Quenching thus depends on an interplay between the inner structure of a galaxy and its surrounding dark matter halo, and lack of perfect synchrony between the two could produce the observed scatter in color versus $\Sigma$ 1 .},

abstract = {We report the discovery of a candidate galaxy with a photo-z of z{\~{}}14 in the first epoch of JWST NIRCam imaging from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) Survey. We searched for z{\textgreater}12 sources using photo-z's based primarily on the expected Lyman-alpha breaks. Following conservative vetting criteria, we identify a robust source at z{\_}phot=14.3 (+0.4, -1.1, 1-sig uncertainty) with F277W=27.8, and detections in five (two) filters at {\textgreater}5sig ({\textgreater}10sig) significance. This object (dubbed Maisie's Galaxy) exhibits a strong F150W-F200W Lyman-alpha break color of {\textgreater}2.5 mag (1sig), resulting in 99.99{\%} (87{\%}) of the photo-z PDF favoring z{\textgreater}10 (13). The source may be marginally detected by HST in F160W, which would widen the lower-redshift bound to z{\~{}}12.5. This slightly lower-redshift interpretation would require very strong Ly-alpha emission ({\textgreater}300 A rest equivalent width), requiring an extremely early ionized bubble. The colors of this object are inconsistent with Galactic stars, and it is resolved (r{\_}h=0.1+/-0.01"; 330 pc). All data quality images show no artifacts at the candidate's position. Independent methods are in robust agreement, and we consistently find a strong preference for z{\textgreater}13 with our fiducial photometry. Maisie's Galaxy appears to be fairly high mass (log M*/Msol{\~{}}8.5) and highly star-forming (log sSFR {\~{}} -7.9/yr) for this early epoch, with a blue rest-UV color (beta{\~{}}-2.3) indicating little dust, though not extremely low metallicities. While the presence of this source is in tension with most cosmological simulation predictions and may seriously challenge dark matter models with suppressed small-scale power, it is in agreement with empirical extrapolations from lower redshift assuming a smoothly declining cosmic SFR density. Should followup spectroscopy validate this redshift, our Universe was already aglow with fairly massive galaxies less than 300 Myr after the Big Bang.},

abstract = {We present the results of the first, deep ALMA imaging covering the full 4.5 sq arcmin of the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) as previously imaged with WFC3/IR on HST. Using a mosaic of 45 pointings, we have obtained a homogeneous 1.3mm image of the HUDF, achieving an rms sensitivity of 35 microJy, at a resolution of 0.7 arcsec. From an initial list of {\~{}}50 {\textgreater}3.5sigma peaks, a rigorous analysis confirms 16 sources with flux densities S(1.3) {\textgreater} 120 microJy. All of these have secure galaxy counterparts with robust redshifts ({\textless}z{\textgreater} = 2.15), and 12 are also detected at 6GHz in new deep JVLA imaging. Due to the wealth of supporting data in this unique field, the physical properties of the ALMA sources are well constrained, including their stellar masses (M*) and UV+FIR star-formation rates (SFR). Our results show that stellar mass is the best predictor of SFR in the high-z Universe; indeed at z {\textgreater} 2 our ALMA sample contains 7 of the 9 galaxies in the HUDF with M* {\textgreater} 2 x 10{\^{}}10 Msun and we detect only one galaxy at z {\textgreater} 3.5, reflecting the rapid drop-off of high-mass galaxies with increasing redshift. The detections, coupled with stacking, allow us to probe the redshift/mass distribution of the 1.3-mm background down to S(1.3) {\~{}} 10 micro-Jy. We find strong evidence for a steep `main sequence' for star-forming galaxies at z {\~{}} 2, with SFR $\backslash$propto M* and a mean specific SFR = 2.2 /Gyr. Moreover, we find that {\~{}}85{\%} of total star formation at z {\~{}} 2 is enshrouded in dust, with {\~{}}65{\%} of all star formation at this epoch occurring in high-mass galaxies (M* {\textgreater} 2 x 10{\^{}}10 Msun), for which the average obscured:unobscured SF ratio is {\~{}}200. Finally, we combine our new ALMA results with the existing HST data to revisit the cosmic evolution of star-formation rate density; we find that this peaks at z {\~{}} 2.5, and that the star-forming Universe transits from primarily unobscured to primarily obscured thereafter at z {\~{}} 4.},

The survey was designed with the primary aim of detecting galaxy clusters at z {\textgreater} 1. In tandem with pre-existing 3.6 mum observations from the Spitzer Space Telescope SWIRE Legacy Survey, SpARCS detects clusters using an infrared adaptation of the two-filter red-sequence cluster technique. The total effective area of the SpARCS cluster survey is 41.9 deg2. In this paper, we provide an overview of the 13.6 deg2 Southern CTIO/MOSAIC II observations. The 28.3 deg2 Northern CFHT/MegaCam observations are summarized in a companion paper by Muzzin et al. In this paper, we also report spectroscopic confirmation of SpARCS J003550-431224, a very rich galaxy cluster at z = 1.335, discovered in the ELAIS-S1 field. To date, this is the highest spectroscopically confirmed redshift for a galaxy cluster discovered using the red-sequence technique. Based on nine confirmed members, SpARCS J003550-431224 has a preliminary velocity dispersion of 1050 ± 230 km s-1. With its proven capability for efficient cluster detection, SpARCS is a demonstration that we have entered an era of large, homogeneously selected z {\textgreater} 1 cluster surveys.},

abstract = {The physical properties inferred from the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of z {\textgreater} 3 galaxies have been influential in shaping our understanding of early galaxy formation and the role galaxies may play in cosmic reionization. Of particular importance is the stellar mass density at early times, which represents the integral of earlier star formation. An important puzzle arising from the measurements so far reported is that the specific star formation rates (sSFRs) evolve far less rapidly than expected in most theoretical models. Yet the observations underpinning these results remain very uncertain, owing in part to the possible contamination of rest-optical broadband light from strong nebular emission lines. To quantify the contribution of nebular emission to broadband fluxes, we investigate the SEDs of 92 spectroscopically confirmed galaxies in the redshift range 3.8 {\textless} z {\textless} 5.0 chosen because the H$\alpha$ line lies within the Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 $\mu$m filter. We demonstrate that the 3.6 $\mu$m flux is systematically in excess of that expected from stellar continuum alone, which we derive by fitting the SED with population synthesis models. No such excess is seen in a control sample of spectroscopically confirmed galaxies with 3.1 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.6 in which there is no nebular contamination in the IRAC filters. From the distribution of our 3.6 $\mu$m flux excesses, we derive an H$\alpha$ equivalent width distribution and consider the implications for both the derived stellar masses and the sSFR evolution. The mean rest-frame H$\alpha$ equivalent width we infer at 3.8 {\textless} z {\textless} 5.0 (270 {\AA}) indicates that nebular emission contributes at least 30{\%} of the 3.6 $\mu$m flux and, by implication, nebular emission is likely to have a much greater impact for galaxies with z {\~{}}= 6-7 where both warm IRAC filters are contaminated. Via our empirically derived equivalent width distribution, we correct the available stellar mass densities and show that the sSFR evolves more rapidly at z {\textgreater} 4 than previously thought, supporting up to a 5× increase between z {\~{}}= 2 and 7. Such a trend is much closer to theoretical expectations. Given our findings, we discuss the prospects for verifying quantitatively the nebular emission line strengths prior to the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope.},

Our analysis exploits precise identifications based on ALMA 870um continuum imaging, combined with the very deep near-infrared imaging from the UKIDSS-UDS survey. We estimate that K{\textgreater}25.3 submillimetre galaxies represent 15+/-2 per cent of the total population brighter than S870=3.6mJy, with an expected surface density of {\~{}}450/deg{\^{}}2 above S870{\textgreater}1mJy. As such they pose a source of contamination in surveys for both high-redshift "quiescent" galaxies and very-high-redshift Lyman-break galaxies. We show that these K-faint submillimetre galaxies are simply the tail of the broader submillimetre population, with comparable dust and stellar masses to K{\textless}25.3 mag submillimetre galaxies, but lying at significantly higher redshifts (z=3.44+/-0.06 versus z=2.36+/-0.11) and having higher dust attenuation (Av=5.2+/-0.3 versus Av=2.9+/-0.1). We investigate the origin of the strong dust attenuation and find indications that these K-faint galaxies have smaller dust continuum sizes than the K{\textless}25.3 galaxies, as measured by ALMA, which suggests their high attenuation is related to their compact sizes. We find a correlation of dust attenuation with star-formation rate surface density (Sigma{\_}SFR), with the K-faint submillimetre galaxies representing the higher-Sigma{\_}SFR and highest-Av galaxies. The concentrated, intense star-formation activity in these systems is likely to be associated with the formation of spheroids in compact galaxies at high redshifts, but as a result of their high obscuration these are completely missed in UV, optical and even near-infrared surveys.},

To reveal the galaxy formation in core regions, we search for proto-cluster cores at {\$}z\backslashsim 2{\$} in {\$}\backslashsim 1.5\backslash, \backslashmathrm{\{}deg{\}}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$} of the COSMOS field. Using pairs of massive galaxies ({\$}\backslashlog(M{\_}{\{}*{\}}/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}})\backslashgeq11{\$}) as tracers of cores, we find 75 candidate cores, among which 54$\backslash${\%} are estimated to be real.

The extended Press-Schechter model shows that their descendant mass at {\$}z=0{\$} is consistent with Fornax-like or Virgo-like clusters. Moreover, using the IllustrisTNG simulation, we confirm that pairs of massive galaxies are good tracers of DMHs massive enough to be regarded as proto-cluster cores. We then derive the stellar mass function (SMF) and the quiescent fraction for member galaxies of the 75 candidate cores. We find that the core galaxies have a more top-heavy SMF than field galaxies at the same redshift, showing an excess at {\$}\backslashlog(M{\_}{\{}*{\}}/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}})\backslashgtrsim 10.5{\$}. The quiescent fraction, {\$}0.17{\_}{\{}-0.04{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+0.04{\}}{\$} in the mass range {\$}9.0\backslashleq \backslashlog(M{\_}{\{}*{\}}/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}})\backslashleq 11.0{\$}, is about three times higher than that of field counterparts, giving an environmental quenching efficiency of {\$}0.13{\_}{\{}-0.04{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+0.04{\}}{\$}. These results suggest that stellar mass assembly and quenching are accelerated as early as at {\$}z\backslashsim 2{\$} in proto-cluster cores.},

CRLE was identified by detection of [CII], [NII] and CO(2-1) line emission, making it the highest redshift, most luminous starburst in the COSMOS field. This massive, dusty galaxy appears to be forming stars at a rate of at least 1500{\$}\backslash,M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} yr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} in a compact region only {\$}\backslashsim3{\$} kpc in diameter. The dynamical and dust emission properties of CRLE suggest an ongoing merger driving the starburst, in a potentially intermediate stage relative to other known dusty galaxies at the same epoch. The ratio of [CII] to [NII] may suggest that an important ({\$}\backslashsim15\backslash{\%}{\$}) contribution to the [CII] emission comes from a diffuse ionized gas component, which could be more extended than the dense, starbursting gas. CRLE appears to be located in a significant galaxy overdensity at the same redshift, potentially associated with a large-scale cosmic structure recently identified in a Lyman Alpha Emitter survey. This overdensity suggests that CRLE and HZ10 reside in a protocluster environment, offering the tantalizing opportunity to study the effect of a massive starburst on protocluster star formation. Our findings support the interpretation that a significant fraction of the earliest galaxy formation may occur from the inside out, within the central regions of the most massive halos, while rapidly evolving into the massive galaxy clusters observed in the local Universe.},

abstract = {We report Atacama Large Millimetre Array (ALMA) observations of four high-redshift dusty star-forming galaxy candidates selected from far-Infrared (FIR)/submm observations in the COSMOS field. We securely detect all galaxies in the continuum and spectroscopically confirm them at z=3.62--5.85 using ALMA 3mm line scans, detecting multiple CO and/or [CI] transitions. This includes the most distant dusty galaxy currently known in the COSMOS field, ID85001929 at z=5.847. These redshifts are lower than we had expected as these galaxies have substantially colder dust temperatures (i.e., their SEDs peak at longer rest frame wavelengths) than most literature sources at z{\textgreater}4. The observed cold dust temperatures are best understood as evidence for optically thick dust continuum in the FIR, rather than the result of low star formation efficiency with rapid metal enrichment. We provide direct evidence that, given their cold spectral energy distributions, CMB plays a significant role biasing their observed Rayleigh-Jeans (RJ) slopes to unlikely steep values and, possibly, reducing their CO fluxes by a factor of two. We recover standard RJ slopes when the CMB contribution is taken into account. High resolution ALMA imaging shows compact morphology and evidence for mergers. This work reveals a population of cold dusty star-forming galaxies that were under-represented in current surveys, and are even colder than typical Main Sequence galaxies at the same redshift. High FIR dust optical depth might be a widespread feature of compact starbursts at any redshift.},

abstract = {We have constructed a new code to produce synthetic spectra of stellar populations that includes massive binaries. We have tested this code against the broadband colours of unresolved young massive stellar clusters in nearby galaxies, the equivalent widths of the Red and Blue Wolf-Rayet bumps in star-forming SDSS galaxies and the UV and optical spectra of the star forming regions Tol-A and B in NGC5398. In each case we find a good agreement between our models and observations. We find that in general binary populations are bluer and have fewer red supergiants, and thus significantly less flux in the I-band and at longer wavelengths, than single star populations. Also we find that Wolf-Rayet stars occur over a wider range of ages up to 10{\^{}}7 years in a stellar population including binaries, increasing the UV flux and Wolf-Rayet spectral features at later times. In addition we find that nebula emission contributes significantly to these observed properties and must be considered when comparing stellar models with observations of unresolved stellar populations. We conclude that incorporation of massive stellar binaries can improve the agreement between observations and synthetic spectral synthesis codes, particularly for systems with young stellar populations.},

abstract = {The strength of gravity-sensitive absorption lines in the integrated light of old stellar populations is one of the few direct probes of the stellar initial mass function (IMF) outside of the Milky Way. Owing to the advent of fully depleted CCDs with little or no fringing it has recently become possible to obtain accurate measurements of these features. Here we present spectra covering the wavelength ranges 0.35 - 0.55 micron and 0.72 - 1.03 micron for the bulge of M31 and 34 early-type galaxies from the SAURON sample, obtained with the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrometer on Keck. The signal-to-noise ratio is {\textgreater}200 per Angstrom out to 1 micron, which is sufficient to measure gravity-sensitive features for individual galaxies and to determine how they depend on other properties of the galaxies. Combining the new data with previously obtained spectra for globular clusters in M31 and the most massive elliptical galaxies in the Virgo cluster we find that the dwarf-sensitive Na I doublet and the FeH Wing-Ford band increase systematically with velocity dispersion, while the giant-sensitive Ca II triplet decreases with dispersion. These trends are consistent with a varying IMF, such that galaxies with deeper potential wells have more dwarf-enriched mass functions. In a companion paper (Conroy {\&} van Dokkum 2012) we use a comprehensive stellar population synthesis model to demonstrate that IMF effects can be separated from age and abundance variations and quantify the IMF variation among early-type galaxies.},

abstract = {Three billion years after the big bang (at redshift z=2), half of the most massive galaxies were already old, quiescent systems with little to no residual star formation and extremely compact with stellar mass densities at least an order of magnitude larger than in low redshift ellipticals, their descendants. Little is known about how they formed, but their evolved, dense stellar populations suggest formation within intense, compact starbursts 1-2 Gyr earlier (at 3{\textless}z{\textless}6). Simulations show that gas-rich major mergers can give rise to such starbursts which produce dense remnants. Sub-millimeter selected galaxies (SMGs) are prime examples of intense, gas-rich, starbursts. With a new, representative spectroscopic sample of compact quiescent galaxies at z=2 and a statistically well-understood sample of SMGs, we show that z=3-6 SMGs are consistent with being the progenitors of z=2 quiescent galaxies, matching their formation redshifts and their distributions of sizes, stellar masses and internal velocities. Assuming an evolutionary connection, their space densities also match if the mean duty cycle of SMG starbursts is 42 (+40/-29) Myr (consistent with independent estimates), which indicates that the bulk of stars in these massive galaxies were formed in a major, early surge of star-formation. These results suggests a coherent picture of the formation history of the most massive galaxies in the universe, from their initial burst of violent star-formation through their appearance as high stellar-density galaxy cores and to their ultimate fate as giant ellipticals.},

We find that the stellar mass of BCGs increase by a factor of 1.8 between z=0.9 and z=0.2. Compared to earlier works, our result is closer to the predictions of semi-analytic models. However, BCGs at z=0.9, relative to BCGs at z=0.2, are still a factor of 1.5 more massive than the predictions of these models. Star formation rates in BCGs at z{\~{}}1 are generally to low to result in significant amounts of mass.

abstract = {In the redshift interval {\$}z=2-3{\$}, the physical conditions of the inter-stellar medium (ISM) in star-forming galaxies are likely to be different from those in the local Universe because of lower gaseous metallicities and higher gas fractions, and observations suggest higher electron densities, higher ionization parameters, and harder UV radiation fields may be common. In this Letter, based on the spectra of H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-selected star-forming galaxies at {\$}z{\$}=2.5 taken with the Multi-Object Spectrometer for InfraRed Exploration (MOSFIRE) on the Keck-1 telescope, we measure electron densities ({\$}n{\_}e{\$}) using the oxygen line ratio ([OII]{\$}\backslashlambda\backslashlambda{\$}3726,3729), and investigate the relationships between the electron density of ionized gas and other physical properties. As a result, we find for the first time that the specific star formation rate (sSFR) and the surface density of SFR ({\$}\backslashSigma{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}SFR{\}}{\$}) are correlated with the electron density at {\$}z{\$}=2.5. The {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}SFR{\}}-n{\_}e{\$} relation is likely to be linked to the global star formation law (Kennicutt-Schmidt law) where star formation activity is regulated by gas density. Moreover, we discuss the mode and geometry of star formation in those galaxies, based on the correlation between sSFR and {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}SFR{\}}{\$}. Highly star-forming galaxies (with high sSFR) tend to be characterized by compact dense regions with high values of both {\$}n{\_}e{\$} and {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}SFR{\}}{\$}.},

abstract = {The hierarchical nature of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology poses serious difficulties for the formation of disk galaxies. To help resolve these issues, we describe a new, merger-driven scenario for the cosmological formation of disk galaxies at high redshifts that supplements the standard dissipational collapse model. In this picture, large gaseous disks may be produced from high angular momentum mergers of systems that are gas dominated, i.e., Mgas/(Mgas+M*){\textgreater}{\~{}}0.5 at the height of the merger. Pressurization from the multiphase ISM prevents the complete conversion of gas into stars during the merger, and if enough gas remains to form a disk, the remnant eventually resembles a disk galaxy. We perform numerical simulations of galaxy mergers to study how supernovae feedback strength, black hole feedback, progenitor gas fraction, merger mass ratio, and orbital geometry impact the formation of remnant disks. We find that disks can build angular momentum through mergers and the degree of rotational support of the baryons in the remnant is primarily related to feedback processes associated with star formation. Disk-dominated remnants are restricted to form in mergers that are gas dominated at the time of final coalescence. We also show that the formation of rotationally supported stellar systems in mergers is not restricted to idealized orbits, and both gas-rich major and minor mergers can produce disk-dominated stellar remnants. We suggest that the hierarchical nature of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology and the physics of the ISM may act together to form spiral galaxies by building the angular momentum of disks through gas-dominated mergers at high redshifts.},

By studying emission-line maps in H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$}, [NII]{\$}\backslashlambda \backslashlambda{\$}6548,6584 and [SII]{\$}\backslashlambda{\$}{\$}\backslashlambda{\$}6716,6731, we explore the kinematic morphology of these systems and constrain properties such as gas-phase metallicities, electron densities and gas-ionization mechanisms. Two of our GPs are rotationally-supported while the others are dispersion-dominated systems. The rotationally-supported galaxies both show evidence for recent or ongoing mergers. However, given that these systems have intact disks, these interactions are likely to have low mass ratios (i.e. minor mergers), suggesting that the minor-merger process may be partly responsible for the high SFRs seen in these GPs. Nevertheless, the fact that the other two GPs appear morphologically undisturbed suggests that mergers (including minor mergers) are not necessary for driving the high star formation rates in such galaxies. We show that the GPs are metal-poor systems (25-40 per cent of solar) and that the gas ionization is not driven by AGN in any of our systems, indicating that AGN activity is not co-eval with star formation in these starbursting galaxies.},

abstract = {We present a new study of stellar mass in a sample of ∼70 submillimeter-selected galaxies (SMGs) with accurate spectroscopic redshifts. We fit combinations of stellar population synthesis models and power laws to the galaxies' observed-frame optical through mid-IR spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to separate stellar emission from non-stellar near-IR continuum. The availability of spectroscopic redshifts significantly enhances our ability to determine unambiguously not only the mass and luminosity of SMGs, but also the presence and contribution of non-stellar emission to their SEDs. By separating the stellar emission from the non-stellar near-IR continuum, we find that ∼50{\%} of our sample have non-stellar contributions of less than ∼10{\%} in rest-frame H band and 10{\%} of our sample have non-stellar contributions greater than 50{\%}. We find that the K-band luminosity of the non-stellar continuum emission is correlated with hard X-ray luminosity, indicating an active galactic nucleus (AGN) origin of the emission. Upon subtracting this AGN-contributed continuum component from all of the galaxies in our sample, we determine a lower median stellar mass for SMGs than previous studies, ∼7 × 10 10 M ⊙. We use constraints of the starburst timescale from molecular gas studies to estimate the amount of fading our sample would undergo if they passively evolve after the starburst terminates. The results suggest that typical SMGs, while among the most massive galaxies at z ∼ 2, are likely to produce descendants of similar mass and luminosity to L* galaxies in the local universe. {\textcopyright} 2011.

abstract = {Large photometric surveys provide a rich source of observations of quiescent galaxies, including a surprisingly large population at z{\textgreater}1. However, identifying large, but clean, samples of quiescent galaxies has proven difficult because of their near-degeneracy with interlopers such as dusty, star-forming galaxies. We describe a new technique for selecting quiescent galaxies based upon t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE), an unsupervised machine learning algorithm for dimensionality reduction. This t-SNE selection provides an improvement both over UVJ, removing interlopers which otherwise would pass color selection, and over photometric template fitting, more strongly towards high redshift. Due to the similarity between the colors of high- and low-redshift quiescent galaxies, under our assumptions t-SNE outperforms template fitting in 63{\%} of trials at redshifts where a large training sample already exists. It also may be able to select quiescent galaxies more efficiently at higher redshifts than the training sample.},

With these data, which cover 27.6 deg2, we can find significant numbers of very rare objects such as ultra-massive quiescent galaxies that populate the extreme massive end of the galaxy mass function, or dense environments that are likely to become present-day massive galaxy clusters. In this paper, the first in a series, we apply our gzKs adaptation of the BzK technique to select our z {\~{}} 1.6 galaxy catalogue and then study the quiescent galaxy stellar mass function with good statistics over M∗ {\~{}}1010.2-1011.7M⊙ . a factor of 30 in mass . including 60 ultra-massive z {\~{}} 1.6 quiescent galaxies with M⊙ {\textgreater} 1011.5M⊙. We find that the stellar mass function of quiescent galaxies at z {\~{}} 1.6 is well represented by the Schechter function over this large mass range. This suggests that the mass-quenching mechanism observed at lower redshifts must have already been well established by this epoch, and that it is likely due to a single physical mechanism over a wide range of mass. This close adherence to the Schechter shape also suggests that neither merging nor gravitational lensing significantly affects the observed quenched population. Finally, comparing measurements of M∗ parameters for quiescent and star-forming populations (ours and from the literature), we find hints of an offset (M∗SF {\textgreater}M∗PE), which could suggest that the efficiency of the quenching process evolves with time.},

abstract = {We present a new evolutionary stellar population synthesis model, which predicts spectral energy distributions for single-age single-metallicity stellar populations (SSPs) at resolution 1.5 {\AA} (FWHM) in the spectral region of the near-infrared Ca II triplet feature. The main ingredient of the model is a new extensive empirical stellar spectral library that has been recently presented by Cenarro et al., which is composed of more than 600 stars with an unprecedented coverage of the stellar atmospheric parameters. Two main products of interest for stellar population analysis are presented. The first is a spectral library for SSPs with metallicities - 1.7 {\textless} [Fe/H] {\textless} +0.2, a large range of ages (0.1-18 Gyr) and initial mass function (IMF) types. They are well suited to modelling galaxy data, since the SSP spectra, with flux-calibrated response curves, can be smoothed to the resolution of the observational data, taking into account the internal velocity dispersion of the galaxy, allowing the user to analyse the observed spectrum in its own system. We also produce integrated absorption-line indices (namely CaT*, PaT and PaT) for the same SSPs in the form of equivalent widths. We find the following behaviour for the Ca II triplet feature in old-aged SSPs: (i) the strength of the CaT* index does not change much with time for all metallicities for ages larger than ∼3 Gyr; (ii) this index shows a strong dependence on metallicity for values below [M/H] ∼ -0.5; and (iii) for larger metallicities this feature does not show a significant dependence either on age or on the metallicity, being more sensitive to changes in the slope of power-like IMF shapes. The SSP spectra have been calibrated with measurements for globular clusters by Armandroff {\&} Zinn, which are well reproduced, probing the validity of using the integrated Can triplet feature for determining the metallicities of these systems. Fitting the models to two early-type galaxies of different luminosities (NGC 4478 and 4365), we find that the Can triplet measurements cannot be fitted unless a very dwarf-dominated IMF is imposed, or if the Ca abundance is even lower than the Fe abundance. More details can be found in work by Cenarro et al.},

abstract = {We study the role of cold gas in quenching star formation in the green valley by analysing ALMA 12 CO (1-0) observations of three galaxies with resolved optical spectroscopy from the MaNGA survey. We present resolution-matched maps of the star formation rate and molecular gas mass. These data are used to calculate the star formation efficiency (SFE) and gas fraction (f gas) for these galaxies separately in the central 'bulge' regions and outer disks. We find that, for the two galaxies whose global specific star formation rate (sSFR) deviates most from the star formation main sequence, the gas fraction in the bulges is significantly lower than that in their disks, supporting an 'inside-out' model of galaxy quenching. For the two galaxies where SFE can be reliably determined in the central regions, the bulges and disks share similar SFEs. This suggests that a decline in f gas is the main driver of lowered sSFR in bulges compared to disks in green valley galaxies. Within the disks, there exist common correlations between the sSFR and SFE and between sSFR and f gas on kpc scales – the local SFE or f gas in the disks declines with local sSFR. Our results support a picture in which the sSFR in bulges is primarily controlled by f gas , whereas both SFE and f gas play a role in lowering the sSFR in disks. A larger sample is required to confirm if the trend established in this work is representative of green valley as a whole.},

We use a custom-built Lya narrow-band filter at the Isaac Newton Telescope, designed to provide a matched volume coverage to the z=2.23 Ha HiZELS survey. Here we present the first results for the COSMOS and UDS fields. Our survey currently reaches a 3{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} line flux limit of {\~{}}4x10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-17{\}}{\$} erg/s/cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$}, and a Lya luminosity limit of {\~{}}10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}42.3{\}}{\$} erg/s. We find 188 Lya emitters over 7.3x10{\$}{\^{}}5{\$} Mpc{\$}{\^{}}{\{}3{\}}{\$}, but also find significant numbers of other line emitting sources corresponding to HeII, CIII] and CIV emission lines. These sources are important contaminants, and we carefully remove them, unlike most previous studies. We find that the Lya luminosity function at z=2.23 is very well described by a Schechter function up to L{\~{}}10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}43{\}}{\$} erg/s with L{\$}{\^{}}*=10{\^{}}{\{}42.59+-0.05{\}}{\$} erg/s, {\$}\backslashphi{\^{}}*=10{\^{}}{\{}-3.09+-0.08{\}}{\$} Mpc{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$} and {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}=-1.75+-0.15. Above L{\~{}}10{\$}{\^{}}{\{}43{\}}{\$} erg/s the Lya luminosity function becomes power-law like, driven by X-ray AGN. We find that Lya-selected emitters have a high escape fraction of 37+-7{\%}, anti-correlated with Lya luminosity and correlated with Lya equivalent width. Lya emitters have ubiquitous large ({\~{}}40 kpc) Lya haloes, 2x larger than their Ha extents. By directly comparing our Lya and Ha luminosity functions we find that the global/overall escape fraction of Lya photons (within a 13 kpc radius) from the full population of star-forming galaxies is 5.1+-0.2{\%} at the peak of the star formation history. An extra 3.3+-0.3{\%} of Lya photons likely still escape, but at larger radii.},

abstract = {We derive the SFH of MS galaxies showing how the SFH peak of a galaxy depends on its seed mass at e.g. z=5. Following the MS, galaxies undergo a drastic slow down of their stellar mass growth after reaching the peak of their SFH. According to abundance matching, these masses correspond to hot and massive DM halos which state could results in less efficient gas inflows on the galaxies and thus could be at the origin of the limited stellar mass growth. As a result, galaxies on the MS can enter the passive region of the UVJ diagram while still forming stars. The ability of the classical analytical SFHs to retrieve the SFR of galaxies from SED fitting is studied. Due to mathematical limitations, the exp-declining and delayed SFH struggle to model high SFR which starts to be problematic at z{\textgreater}2. The exp-rising and log-normal SFHs exhibit the opposite behavior with the ability to reach very high SFR, and thus model starburst galaxies, but not low values such as those expected at low redshift for massive galaxies. We show that these four analytical forms recover the SFR of MS galaxies with an error dependent on the model and the redshift. They are, however, sensitive enough to probe small variations of SFR within the MS but all the four fail to recover the SFR of rapidly quenched galaxies. However, these SFHs lead to an artificial gradient of age, parallel to the MS which is not exhibited by a simulated sample. This gradient is also produced on real data, using a sample of GOODS-South galaxies at 1.5{\textless}z{\textless}1.2. We propose a SFH composed of a delayed form to model the bulk of stellar population plus a flexibility in the recent SFH. This SFH provides very good estimates of the SFR of MS, starbursts, and rapidly quenched galaxies at all z. Furthermore, used on the GOODS-South sample, the age gradient disappears, showing its dependency on the SFH assumption made to perform the SED fitting.},

abstract = {Early quiescent galaxies at z{\~{}}2 are known to be remarkably compact compared to their nearby counterparts. Possible progenitors of these systems include galaxies that are structurally similar, but are still rapidly forming stars. Here, we present Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations of the CO(1-0) line towards three such compact, star-forming galaxies at z{\~{}}2.3, significantly detecting one. The VLA observations indicate baryonic gas fractions {\textgreater}{\~{}}5 times lower and gas depletion times {\textgreater}{\~{}}10 times shorter than normal, extended massive star-forming galaxies at these redshifts. At their current star formation rates, all three objects will deplete their gas reservoirs within 100Myr. These objects are among the most gas-poor objects observed at z{\textgreater}2, and are outliers from standard gas scaling relations, a result which remains true regardless of assumptions about the CO-H2 conversion factor. Our observations are consistent with the idea that compact, star-forming galaxies are in a rapid state of transition to quiescence in tandem with the build-up of the z{\~{}}2 quenched population. In the detected compact galaxy, we see no evidence of rotation or that the CO-emitting gas is spatially extended relative to the stellar light. This casts doubt on recent suggestions that the gas in these compact galaxies is rotating and significantly extended compared to the stars. Instead, we suggest that, at least for this object, the gas is centrally concentrated, and only traces a small fraction of the total galaxy dynamical mass.},

However, advances in observational techniques have led to the discovery of protoclusters out to {\$}z \backslashsim 7{\$}, suggesting that the late-assembly picture may not be fully complete.

At {\$}z\backslashlesssim{\$} 1, denser environments more efficiently quench galaxies with higher masses (log({\$}M/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}){\$}\backslashgtrsim{\$} 10.7), possibly due to a higher merger rate of massive galaxies in denser environments, and that mass quenching is more efficient in denser regions.

The scatters around the scaling relations are also larger for the bulges in galaxies with lower bulge-to-total ratios. Both the departure in slopes and larger scatters are likely originated from the presence of young stars. The bulges in galaxies with low bulge-to-total ratios show signs of a frosting of young stars so substantial that their luminosity-weighted Balmer-line ages are as small as 1$\backslash$,Gyr in some cases. While bulges seem largely similar in optical properties to elliptical galaxies, they do show clear and systematic departures as a function of bulge-to-total ratio. The stellar properties and perhaps associated formation processes of bulges seem much more diverse than those of elliptical galaxies.},

abstract = {We present ALMA observations and multiwavelength spectral energy distribution (SED) analysis in a WISE-selected, hyperluminous dust-obscured quasar W0533-3401 at {\$}z=2.9{\$}. We derive its physical properties of each component, such as molecular gas, stars, dust and the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). Both the dust continuum at 3 mm and the CO(3-2) line are detected. The derived molecular gas mass {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm gas{\}}=8.4\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}\backslash M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} and its fraction {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashrm gas{\}}=0.7{\$} suggest that W0533-3401 is gas-rich. The star formation rate (SFR) has been estimated to be {\$}\backslashsim3000-7000\backslash M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} yr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} by using different methods. The high values of SFR and specific SFR suggest that W0533-3401 is a maximum-starburst. The corresponding gas depletion timescales are very short ({\$}t{\_}{\{}\backslashrm depl{\}}\backslashsim12-28{\$} Myr). The CO(3-2) emission line is marginally resolved and has a velocity gradient, which is possibly due to a rotating gas disk, gas outflow or merger. Finally, we infer the black hole mass growth rate of W0533-3401 ({\$}{\{}\backslashdot{\{}M{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm BH{\}}{\$} = 49 {\$}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} yr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}), which suggests a rapid growth of the central SMBH. The observed black hole to stellar mass ratio {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm BH{\}}/M{\_}\backslashstar{\$} of W0533-3401, which is dependent on the adopted Eddington ratio, is over one order of magnitude higher than the local value, and is evolving towards the evolutionary trend of unobscured quasars. Our results are consistent with the scenario that $\backslash$wobs, with both a gas-rich maximum-starburst and a rapid black hole growth, is experiencing a short transition phase towards an unobscured quasar.},

abstract = {Accurate models of the star formation histories (SFHs) of recently-quenched galaxies can provide constraints on when and how galaxies shut down their star formation. The recent development of "non-parametric" SFH models promises the flexibility required to make these measurements. However, model and prior choices significantly affect derived SFHs, particularly for post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) which have sharp changes in their recent SFH. In this paper, we create mock PSBs, then use the Prospector SED fitting software to test how well four different SFH models recover key properties. We find that a two-component parametric model performs well for our simple mock galaxies, but is sensitive to model mismatches. The fixed- and flexible-bin non-parametric models included in Prospector are able to rapidly quench a major burst of star formation, but systematically underestimate the post-burst age by up to 200 Myr. We develop a custom SFH model that allows for additional flexibility in the recent SFH. Our flexible non-parametric model is able to constrain post-burst ages with no significant offset and just {\~{}}90 Myr of scatter. Our results suggest that while standard non-parametric models are able to recover first-order quantities of the SFH (mass, SFR, average age), accurately recovering higher-order quantities (burst fraction, quenching time) requires careful consideration of model flexibility. These mock recovery tests are a critical part of future SFH studies. Finally, we show that our new, public SFH model is able to accurately recover the properties of mock star-forming and quiescent galaxies and is suitable for broader use in the SED fitting community.},

abstract = {The dust extinction curve is a critical component of many observational programs and an important diagnostic of the physics of the interstellar medium. Here we present new measurements of the dust extinction curve and its variation towards tens of thousands of stars, a hundred-fold larger sample than in existing detailed studies. We use data from the APOGEE spectroscopic survey in combination with ten-band photometry from Pan-STARRS1, 2MASS, and WISE. We find that the extinction curve in the optical through infrared is well characterized by a one-parameter family of curves described by R(V). The extinction curve is more uniform than suggested in past works, with sigma(R(V)) = 0.18, and with less than one percent of sight lines having R(V) {\textgreater} 4. Our data and analysis have revealed two new aspects of Galactic extinction: first, we find significant, wide-area variations in R(V) throughout the Galactic plane. These variations are on scales much larger than individual molecular clouds, indicating that R(V) variations must trace much more than just grain growth in dense molecular environments. Indeed, we find no correlation between R(V) and dust column density up to E(B-V) {\~{}} 2. Second, we discover a strong relationship between R(V) and the far-infrared dust emissivity.},

abstract = {We derive the first luminosity-metallicity (L-Z) relation for a large objectively selected sample of local galaxy pairs, and we compare the L-Z relation of the pairs with the relation for the Nearby Field Galaxy Survey. Galaxy pair members with small projected separations (s{\textless}20 kpc h-1) have systematically lower metallicities ({\~{}}0.2 dex on average) than either the field galaxies or more widely separated pairs at the same luminosity. There is a strong correlation between metallicity and central burst strength in the galaxy pairs. All five galaxies in the pairs sample with strong central bursts have close companions and metallicities lower than the comparable field galaxies. Our results provide strong observational evidence for a merger scenario in which galaxy interactions cause gas flows toward the central regions, carrying less enriched gas from the outskirts of the galaxy into the central regions. The less enriched gas dilutes the preexisting nuclear gas to produce a lower metallicity than would be obtained prior to the interaction. These gas flows trigger central bursts of star formation, causing strong central burst strengths and possibly aiding the formation of blue bulges. We show that the timescale and central gas dilution required by this scenario are consistent with predictions from hydrodynamic merger models.},

abstract = {We examine the robustness of the color–color selection of quiescent galaxies (QGs) against contamination of dusty star-forming galaxies using the latest submillimeter data. We selected 18,304 QG candidates out to z ∼ 3 using the commonly adopted NUV – r – J selection based on the high-quality multiwavelength COSMOS2015 catalog. Using extremely deep 450 and 850 $\mu$ m catalogs from the latest JCMT SCUBA-2 Large Programs, S2COSMOS and STUDIES, as well as the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array submillimeter, VLA 3 GHz, and Spitzer MIPS 24 $\mu$ m catalogs, we identified luminous, dusty, star-forming galaxies among the QG candidates. We also conducted stacking analyses in the SCUBA-2 450 and 850 $\mu$ m images to look for less-luminous dusty galaxies among the QG candidates. By cross matching to the 24 $\mu$ m and 3 GHz data, we were able to identify a subgroup of “IR-radio-bright” QGs that possess strong 450 and 850 $\mu$ m stacking signals. The potential contamination of these luminous and less-luminous dusty galaxies accounts for approximately 10{\%} of the color-selected QG candidates. In addition, there exists a spatial correlation between the luminous star-forming galaxies and the QGs at a ≲60 kpc scale. Finally, we found a high QG fraction among radio active galactic nuclei (AGNs) at z {\textless} 1.5. Our data show a strong correlation between QGs and radio AGNs, which may suggest a connection between the quenching process and the radio-mode AGN feedback.},

abstract = {We have carried out panoramic Ly$\alpha$ narrow-band imaging with Suprime-Cam on Subaru towards the known protocluster USS1558-003 at z = 2.53. Our previous narrow-band imaging in the near-infrared identified multiple dense groups of Ha emitters (HAEs) within the protocluster. We have now identified the large-scale structures across a {\~{}}50 comoving Mpc scale traced by Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) in which the protocluster traced by the HAEs is embedded. On a smaller scale, however, there are remarkably few LAEs in the regions of HAE overdensities. Moreover, the stacking analyses of the images show that HAEs in higher-density regions show systematically lower escape fractions of Ly$\alpha$ photons than those of HAEs in lower-density regions. These phenomena may be driven by the extra depletion of Ly$\alpha$ emission lines along our line of sight by more intervening cold circumgalactic/intergalactic medium and/or dust in the dense core.We also caution that all the previous high-z protocluster surveys using LAEs as tracers would have largely missed galaxies in the very dense cores of the protoclusters where we would expect to see any early environmental effects.},

The sample is selected based on the excess in the observed Ks broad band flux relative to the best-fit stellar continuum model flux. By applying a 0.3 mag excess as a primary criterion, we select 240 EELG candidates with intense emission lines and estimated observed-frame equivalent width (EW) of {\$}\backslashgtrsim 1000{\$} angstrom over the UltraVISTA-DR2 ultra-deep stripe in the COSMOS field.

These physical properties suggest that they are low metallicity galaxies with higher ionization parameters and harder UV spectra than normal SFGs, which is similar to galaxies with Lyman continuum (LyC) leakage. Among our EELGs, those with the largest [OIII]/[OII] and EW([OIII]) values would be the most promising candidates to search for LyC leakage.},

abstract = {Estimates of galaxy merger rates based on counts of close pairs typically assume that most of the observed systems will merge within a few hundred Myr (for projected pair separations {\textless}25 kpc/h). Here we investigate these assumptions using virtual galaxy catalogues derived from the Millennium Simulation, a very large N-body simulation of structure formation in the concordance LCDM cosmology. These catalogues have been shown to be at least roughly consistent with a wide range of properties of the observed galaxy population at both low and high redshift. Here we show that they also predict close pair abundances at low redshift which agree with those observed. They thus embed a realistic and realistically evolving galaxy population within the standard structure formation paradigm, and so are well-suited to calibrate the relation between close galaxy pairs and mergers. We show that observational methods, when applied to our mock galaxy surveys, do indeed identify pairs which are physically close and due to merge. The sample-averaged merging time depends only weakly on the stellar mass and redshift of the pair. At z{\textless}2 this time-scale is T {\~{}} T0 r25 M*{\^{}}-0.3, where r25 is the maximum projected separation of the pair sample in units of 25 kpc/h, M* is the typical stellar mass of the pairs in units of 3x10{\^{}}10 Msol/h, and the coefficient T0 is 1.1 Gyr for samples selected to have line-of-sight velocity difference smaller than 300 km/s and 1.6 Gyr for samples where this velocity difference is effectively unconstrained. These timescales increase slightly with redshift and are longer than assumed in most observational studies, implying that merger rates have typically been overestimated.},

abstract = {The Main Sequence (MS) of star-forming galaxies plays a fundamental role in driving galaxy evolution and in our efforts to understand it. However, different studies find significant differences in the normalization, slope and shape of the MS. These discrepancies arise mainly from the different selection criteria adopted to isolate star-forming galaxies, that may include or exclude galaxies with specific star formation rate (SFR) substantially below the MS value. To obviate this limitation of all current criteria, we propose an objective definition of the MS that does not rely at all on a pre-selection of star-forming galaxies. Constructing the 3D SFR-Mass-Number plot, the MS is then defined as the ridge line of the star-forming peak, as illustrated with various figures. The advantages of such definition are manifold. If generally adopted it will facilitate the inter-comparison of results from different groups using the same star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass diagnostics, or to highlight the relative systematics of different diagnostics. All this could help understanding MS galaxies as systems in a quasi-steady state equilibrium and would also provide a more objective criterion for identifying quenching galaxies.},

With previous data from our High-Z Supernova Search Team, this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the Hubble constant (H{\_}0), the mass density (Omega{\_}M), the cosmological constant (Omega{\_}Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q{\_}0), and the dynamical age of the Universe (t{\_}0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10{\%} to 15{\%} farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega{\_}M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater} 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q{\_}0 {\textless} 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega{\_}M {\textgreater} 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q{\_}0 {\textless}0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega{\_}M=0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega{\_}Lambda{\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior (Omega{\_}M+Omega{\_}Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater}0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega{\_}M=1) is ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination.

abstract = {We present observations of 10 type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) between 0.16 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.62. With previous data from our High-Z Supernova Search Team, this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the Hubble constant (H{\_}0), the mass density (Omega{\_}M), the cosmological constant (Omega{\_}Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q{\_}0), and the dynamical age of the Universe (t{\_}0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10{\%} to 15{\%} farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega{\_}M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater} 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q{\_}0 {\textless} 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega{\_}M {\textgreater} 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q{\_}0 {\textless}0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega{\_}M=0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega{\_}Lambda{\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior (Omega{\_}M+Omega{\_}Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega{\_}Lambda {\textgreater}0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega{\_}M=1) is ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects reconciles the data with Omega{\_}Lambda=0 and q{\_}0 {\textgreater} 0.},

abstract = {Using observations from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey, we investigate the physical conditions of star-forming regions in {\$}z\backslashsim2.3{\$} galaxies, specifically the electron density and ionization state. From measurements of the [O II]{\$}\backslashlambda\backslashlambda{\$}3726,3729 and [S II]{\$}\backslashlambda\backslashlambda{\$}6716,6731 doublets, we find a median electron density of {\$}\backslashsim250{\$} cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$} at {\$}z\backslashsim2.3{\$}, an increase of an order of magnitude compared to measurements of galaxies at {\$}z\backslashsim0{\$}. While {\$}z\backslashsim2.3{\$} galaxies are offset towards significantly higher O{\$}{\_}{\{}32{\}}{\$} values relative to local galaxies at fixed stellar mass, we find that the high-redshift sample follows a similar distribution to the low-metallicity tail of the local distribution in the O{\$}{\_}{\{}32{\}}{\$} vs. R{\$}{\_}{\{}23{\}}{\$} and O3N2 diagrams. Based on these results, we propose that {\$}z\backslashsim2.3{\$} star-forming galaxies have the same ionization parameter as local galaxies at fixed metallicity. In combination with simple photoionization models, the position of local and {\$}z\backslashsim2.3{\$} galaxies in excitation diagrams suggests that there is no significant change in the hardness of the ionizing spectrum at fixed metallicity from {\$}z\backslashsim0{\$} to {\$}z\backslashsim2.3{\$}. We find that {\$}z\backslashsim2.3{\$} galaxies show no offset compared to low-metallicity local galaxies in emission line ratio diagrams involving only lines of hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur, but show a systematic offset in diagrams involving [N II]{\$}\backslashlambda{\$}6584. We conclude that the offset of {\$}z\backslashsim2.3{\$} galaxies from the local star-forming sequence in the [N II] BPT diagram is primarily driven by elevated N/O at fixed O/H compared to local galaxies. These results suggest that the local gas-phase and stellar metallicity sets the ionization state of star-forming regions at {\$}z\backslashsim0{\$} and {\$}z\backslashsim2{\$}.},

abstract = {We analyse publicly available, individual spectra of four massive (M {\textgreater}1011M⊙) early-type galaxies with redshifts in the range 1.4 ≤ z ≤ 2 to determine their stellar content, extending our previous work up to z {\~{}} 2. The wide wavelength range of the VLT/X-Shooter spectroscopic data in the UV-Optical-NIR arms along with the availability of spectro-photometry allows us to explore different techniques to obtain the stellar population properties, namely through age/metallicity-sensitive spectral indices, full spectral fitting, and broad-band photometric fitting. Moreover, together with the widely used optical Lick indices, we consider further indices in the UV rest frame, and demonstrate that UV indices significantly help the accuracy of the resulting population parameters. We find galaxy ages ranging from 0.2 to 4 Gyr, where the oldest galaxy is found at the lowest redshift, with an excellent agreement between ages determined via indices, full spectral fitting, or broad-band colours. These ages are in perfect agreement with ages of local galaxies at the same velocity dispersion when we assume pure passive evolution. Total metallicities derived from indices show some scatter (between less than half-solar to very high values, [Z/H] {\~{}} 0.6). We speculate on possible mechanisms explaining these values, but given the sample size and low S/N of the spectra no conclusion can be made. Indices in the UV rest frame generally lead to similar conclusions as optical indices. For the oldest galaxy (4 Gyr), we show that its UV indices can only be explained by stellar population models including a UV contribution from old stellar populations, suggesting that old, UV bright populations start to inhabit mature galaxies of a few Gyr of age. This is the highest redshift (z {\~{}} 1.4) detection of the UV upturn up to date.},

abstract = {There is good evidence that the centers of massive early-type galaxies have a bottom-heavy stellar initial mass function (IMF) compared to the IMF of the Milky Way. Here we study the radial variation of the IMF within such galaxies, using a combination of high quality Keck spectroscopy and a new suite of stellar population synthesis models that cover a wide range in metallicity. As in the previous studies in this series, the models are fitted directly to the spectra and treat all elemental abundance ratios as free parameters. Using newly obtained spectroscopy for six galaxies, including deep data extending to {\~{}}1Re for the galaxies NGC1407, NGC1600, and NGC2695, we find that the IMF varies strongly with galactocentric radius. For all six galaxies the IMF is bottom-heavy in the central regions, with average mass-to-light ratio "mismatch" parameter a{\~{}}2.5 at R=0. The IMF rapidly becomes more bottom-light with increasing radius, flattening off near the Milky Way value (a{\~{}}1.1) at R{\textgreater}0.4Re. A consequence is that the luminosity-weighted average IMF depends on the measurement aperture: within R=Re we find {\textless}a{\textgreater}=1.3-1.5, consistent with recent lensing and dynamical results from SLACS and ATLAS-3D. Our results are also consistent with several earlier studies that were based on analyses of radial gradients of line indices. The observed IMF gradients support galaxy formation models in which the central regions of massive galaxies had a different formation history than their outer parts. Finally, we make use of the high signal-to-noise central spectra of NGC1407 and NGC2695 to demonstrate how we can disentangle IMF effects and abundance effects.},

abstract = {We present the detailed characterisation of a sample of 56 sources serendipitously detected in ALMA Band-7, as part of the ALMA Large Program to INvestigate CII at Early Times (ALPINE) in COSMOS and ECDFS. These sources have been used to derive the total infrared luminosity function (LF) and to estimate the cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD) up to z=6. We have looked for counterparts in all the available multi-wavelength and photometric redshift catalogues, and in deeper near- and mid-IR source lists and maps, to identify optically dark sources with no matches in the public catalogues. Our ALMA blind survey allows us to push further the study of the nature and evolution of dusty galaxies at high-z, identifying luminous and massive sources to redshifts and faint luminosities never probed before by any far-infrared surveys. The ALPINE data are the first ones to sample the faint-end of the infrared LF, showing little evolution from z=2.5 to z=6, and a flat slope up to the highest redshifts. The SFRD obtained by integrating the luminosity function remains almost constant between z=2 and 6, and significantly higher than the optical/UV derivations, showing an important contribution of dusty galaxies and obscured star formation up to high-z. About 16. per cent of the ALPINE serendipitous continuum sources are optically+near-IR dark (7 show a counterpart only in the mid-IR and no HST or near-IR identification, while 2 are detected as [CII] emitters at z=5). The 7 HST and near-IR dark galaxies with mid-IR counterpart contribute for about 15 per cent of the total SFRD at z=5 and dominate the high-mass end of the stellar mass function at z{\textgreater}3.},

abstract = {We analyze very deep HST, VLT and Spitzer photometry of galaxies at 2{\textless}z{\textless}3.5 in the Hubble Deep Field South. The sample is selected from the deepest public K-band imaging currently available. We show that the rest-frame U-V vs V-J color-color diagram is a powerful diagnostic of the stellar populations of distant galaxies. Galaxies with red rest-frame U-V colors are generally red in rest-frame V-J as well. However, at a given U-V color a range in V-J colors exists, and we show that this allows us to distinguish young, dusty galaxies from old, passively evolving galaxies. We quantify the effects of IRAC photometry on estimates of masses, ages, and the dust content of z{\textgreater}2 galaxies. The estimated distributions of these properties do not change significantly when adding IRAC data to the UBVIJHK photometry. However, for individual galaxies the addition of IRAC can improve the constraints on the stellar populations, especially for red galaxies: uncertainties in stellar mass decrease by a factor of 2.7 for red (U-V {\textgreater} 1) galaxies, but only by a factor of 1.3 for blue (U-V {\textless} 1) galaxies. We find a similar color-dependence of the improvement for estimates of age and dust extinction. In addition, the improvement from adding IRAC depends on the availability of full near-infrared JHK coverage; if only K-band were available, the mass uncertainties of blue galaxies would decrease by a more substantial factor 1.9. Finally, we find that a trend of galaxy color with stellar mass is already present at z{\textgreater}2. The most massive galaxies at high redshift have red rest-frame U-V colors compared to lower mass galaxies even when allowing for complex star formation histories.},

abstract = {We present the relation between galaxy structure and spectral type, using a K-selected galaxy sample at 0.5{\textless}z{\textless}2.0. Based on similarities between the UV-to-NIR spectral energy distributions, we classify galaxies into 32 spectral types. The different types span a wide range in evolutionary phases, and thus -- in combination with available CANDELS/F160W imaging -- are ideal to study the structural evolution of galaxies. Effective radii (R{\_}e) and Sersic parameters (n) have been measured for 572 individual galaxies, and for each type, we determine R{\_}e at fixed stellar mass by correcting for the mass-size relation. We use the rest-frame U-V vs. V-J diagram to investigate evolutionary trends. When moving into the direction perpendicular to the star-forming sequence, in which we see the Halpha equivalent width and the specific star formation rate (sSFR) decrease, we find a decrease in R{\_}e and an increase in n. On the quiescent sequence we find an opposite trend, with older redder galaxies being larger. When splitting the sample into redshift bins, we find that young post-starburst galaxies are most prevalent at z{\textgreater}1.5 and significantly smaller than all other galaxy types at the same redshift. This result suggests that the suppression of star formation may be associated with significant structural evolution at z{\textgreater}1.5. At z{\textless}1, galaxy types with intermediate sSFRs (10{\^{}}{\{}-11.5{\}}-10{\^{}}{\{}-10.5{\}} yr{\^{}}-1) do not have post-starburst SED shapes. These galaxies have similar sizes as older quiescent galaxies, implying that they can passively evolve onto the quiescent sequence, without increasing the average size of the quiescent galaxy population.},

We find similar star formation rates in cluster and field galaxies throughout our range of stellar masses. The results are comparable to those seen in other clusters at similar redshifts, and consistent with our previous photometric evidence for little quenching activity in clusters. One possible explanation for our results is that galaxies in our z ∼ 1.6 clusters have been accreted too recently to show signs of environmental quenching. It is also possible that the clusters are not yet dynamically mature enough to produce important environmental quenching effects shown to be important at low redshift, such as ram-pressure stripping or harassment.},

abstract = {Our velocity relative to the rest frame of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) generates a dipole temperature anisotropy on the sky which has been well measured for more than 30 years, and has an accepted amplitude of v/c = 0.00123, or v = 369km/s. In addition to this signal generated by Doppler boosting of the CMB monopole, our motion also modulates and aberrates the CMB temperature fluctuations (as well as every other source of radiation at cosmological distances). This is an order 0.1{\%} effect applied to fluctuations which are already one part in roughly one hundred thousand, so it is quite small. Nevertheless, it becomes detectable with the all-sky coverage, high angular resolution, and low noise levels of the Planck satellite. Here we report a first measurement of this velocity signature using the aberration and modulation effects on the CMB temperature anisotropies, finding a component in the known dipole direction, (l,b)=(264, 48) [deg], of 384km/s +- 78km/s (stat.) +- 115km/s (syst.). This is a significant confirmation of the expected velocity.},

abstract = {The environments where galaxies reside play a key role in shaping their star formation histories over cosmic time, yet such environmental effects remain elusive at high redshifts. We update this environmental process by adopting an advanced measure for cluster in-fall time using kinematics and reveal that galaxies experience a gradual decline of star formation after they fall into cluster environments up to {\$}z \backslashsim 1{\$}. This conclusion is drawn from a uniform analysis of a remarkably large sample of 105 clusters and 1626 spectroscopically-confirmed member galaxies from the SPT and ACT Sunyaev-Zel'dovich surveys at 0.26 {\$}{\textless} z {\textless}{\$} 1.13. Intriguingly, we find clear evidence for a gradual increase in the mean age ({\$}\backslashsim{\$} 0.71 {\$}\backslashpm{\$} 0.4 Gyr based on a 4000 Angstrom break, {\$}\backslashrm D{\_}{\{}\backslashrm n{\}}4000{\$}) of the galaxy's stellar populations with the time spent in the cluster environment. This environmental quenching effect is found regardless of galaxy luminosity (faint or bright) and redshift (low-{\$}z{\$} or high-{\$}z{\$}), although the exact stellar age of galaxies depends on both parameters at fixed environmental effect. Such a systematic increase of {\$}\backslashrm D{\_}{\{}\backslashrm n{\}}4000{\$} with in-fall proxy would suggest that galaxies that were accreted into hosts earlier were quenched earlier, due to longer exposure to environmental effects such as ram pressure stripping and strangulation. Thus, our results provide new insights into environmental quenching effects spanning a large range in cosmic time ({\$}\backslashsim 5.2{\$} Gyr, {\$}z=0.26-1.13{\$}) and demonstrate the power of using a kinematically-derived in-fall time proxy.},

This survey uses five filters and has the advantage (compared to the Cycle 21 BoRG program) of including imaging in the JH140 band, covering continuous wavelengths from the visible to near-infrared (lambda = 0.35um - 1.7um). This allows us to perform reliable selection of galaxies at z{\textgreater}8 using the photometric redshift technique. We use these galaxy candidates to constrain the bright end of the rest-frame ultraviolet luminosity function in this epoch.

abstract = {In order to study stellar populations and galaxy structures at intermediate and high redshift (z=0.2-2.0) and link these properties to those of low redshift galaxies, there is a need for well-defined local reference samples. Especially for galaxies in massive clusters, such samples are often limited to the Coma cluster galaxies. We present consistently calibrated velocity dispersions and absorption line indices for galaxies in the central 2 R500 x 2 R500 of four massive clusters at z{\textless}0.1: Abell 426/Perseus, Abell 1656/Coma, Abell 2029, and Abell 2142. The measurements are based on data from Gemini Observatory, McDonald Observatory, and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. For bulge-dominated galaxies the samples are 95 percent complete in Perseus and Coma, and 74 percent complete in A2029 and A2142, to a limit of M{\_}Babs {\textless}= -18.5 mag. The data serve as the local reference for our studies of galaxy populations in the higher redshift clusters that are part of the Gemini/HST Galaxy Cluster Project (GCP). We establish the scaling relations between line indices and velocity dispersions as reference for the GCP. We derive stellar population parameters ages, metallicities [M/H], and abundance ratios from line indices, both averaged in bins of velocity dispersion, and from individual measurements for galaxies in Perseus and Coma. The zero points of relations between the stellar population parameters and the velocity dispersions limit the allowed cluster-to-cluster variation of the four clusters to +-0.08 dex in age, +-0.06 dex in [M/H], +-0.07 dex in [CN/Fe], and +-0.03 dex in [Mg/Fe].},

abstract = {As progenitors of the most massive objects, protoclusters are key to tracing the evolution and star-formation history of the Universe, and are responsible for ≳ 20 per cent of the cosmic star formation at z {\textgreater} 2. Using a combination of state-of-the-art hydrodynamical simulations and empirical models, we show that current galaxy-formation models do not produce enough star formation in protoclusters to match observations. We find that the star-formation rates (SFRs) predicted from the models are an order of magnitude lower than what is seen in observations, despite the relatively good agreement found for their mass-accretion histories, specifically that they lie on an evolutionary path to become Coma-like clusters at z ≃ 0. Using a well-studied protocluster core at z = 4.3 as a test case, we find that star-formation efficiency of protocluster galaxies is higher than predicted by the models. We show that a large part of the discrepancy can be attributed to a dependence of SFR on the numerical resolution of the simulations, with a roughly factor of 3 drop in SFR when the spatial resolution decreases by a factor of 4. We also present predictions up to z ≃ 7. Compared to lower redshifts, we find that centrals (the most massive member galaxies) are more distinct from the other galaxies, while protocluster galaxies are less distinct from field galaxies. All these results suggest that, as a rare and extreme population at high-z, protoclusters can help constrain galaxy formation models tuned to match the average population at z ≃ 0.},

We measure the alpha enhancement via the magnesium abundance, obtaining [Mg/Fe] = 0.23 ± 0.12, consistent with galaxies of similar mass in the local universe, indicating no evolution in the average alpha enhancement of log( M * / M ⊙ ) ∼ 11 quiescent galaxies over the last ∼8 Gyr. This suggests the very high alpha enhancements recently reported for several bright z ∼ 1–2 quiescent galaxies are due to their extreme masses, log( M * / M ⊙ ) ≳ 11.5, in accordance with the well-known downsizing trend, rather than being typical of the z ≳ 1 population. The metallicity evolution we observe with redshift (falling [Z/H], [Fe/H], constant [Mg/Fe]) is consistent with recent studies. We recover a mean stellar age of        2.5   − 0.4   + 0.6      Gyr, corresponding to a formation redshift        z   form   =   2.4   − 0.3   + 0.6      . Recent studies have obtained varying average formation redshifts for z ≳ 1 massive quiescent galaxies, and, as these studies report consistent metallicities, we identify models with different star formation histories as the most likely cause. Larger spectroscopic samples from upcoming ground-based instruments will provide precise constraints on ages and metallicities at z ≳ 1. Combining these with precise stellar mass functions for z {\textgreater} 2 quiescent galaxies from the James Webb Space Telescope will provide an independent test of formation redshifts derived from spectral fitting. },

Essentially all of the non-cluster extragalactic legacy fields are utilized, including the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), the Hubble Frontier Field parallel fields, and all five CANDELS fields, for a total survey area of 1136 arcmin{\^{}}2. Our determinations include galaxies at z{\~{}}2-3 leveraging the deep HDUV, UVUDF, and ERS WFC3/UVIS observations available over a {\~{}}150 arcmin{\^{}}2 area in the GOODS North and GOODS South regions. All together, our collective samples include {\textgreater}24,000 sources, {\textgreater}2.3x larger than previous selections with HST. 5766, 6332, 7240, 3449, 1066, 601, 246, and 33 sources are identified at z{\~{}}2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9, respectively. Combining our results with an earlier z{\~{}}10 LF determination by Oesch+2018a, we quantify the evolution of the {\$}UV{\$} LF. Our results indicate that there is (1) a smooth flattening of the faint-end slope alpha from alpha{\~{}}-2.4 at z{\~{}}10 to -1.5 at z{\~{}}2, (2) minimal evolution in the characteristic luminosity M* at z{\textgreater}{\~{}}2.5, and (3) a monotonic increase in the normalization log{\_}10 phi* from z{\~{}}10 to z{\~{}}2, which can be well described by a simple second-order polynomial, consistent with an "accelerated" evolution scenario. We find that each of these trends (from z{\~{}}10 to z{\~{}}2.5 at least) can be readily explained on the basis of the evolution of the halo mass function and a simple constant star formation efficiency model.},

We use predictions from a cosmological radiation hydrodynamic simulation to map these luminosities onto physical space, constraining the minimum dark matter halo mass and stellar mass that the Frontier Fields probe. While previously-published theoretical studies have suggested or assumed that early star formation was suppressed in halos less massive than {\$}10{\^{}}9{\$}--{\$}10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, we find that recent observations demand vigorous star formation in halos at least as massive as (3.1, 5.6, 10.5){\$}\backslashtimes10{\^{}}9 M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} at {\$}z=(6,7,8){\$}.

abstract = {We present a photometric investigation of the globular cluster population of NGC 1399, the central galaxy in the Fornax cluster, in Washington C and Kron R filters within a field of 36'x36'. This is the largest area around this galaxy ever studied with CCD photometry. The cluster system of NGC 1399 is found to extend further than 100 kpc away from the galaxy. The color distribution exhibits a pronounced bimodality. Within a radial distance of about 55 kpc, the red clusters are more strongly concentrated to the center than the blueclusters. At larger radii, the surface density profiles of the clusters are indistinguishable and match well the distribution of the galaxy light. Over the entire radial distance range, the surface brightness profile of NGC 1399 can be very well fitted by a power law with an exponent of -1.85 and a core radius of 3.3". No steepening of the luminosity profile can be detected at large radii. We suggest that the power law profile of NGC 1399 results from the galaxy being embedded in a large dark matter halo, which prevents the stellar density profile from steepening outwards. The cluster system contains 6450+-700 clusters and the specific frequency is found to be 5.1+-1.2 in the V band. While NGC 1399 shows a pronounced color gradient. Using simple assumptions about the underlying population that formed during the same star formation event as the globular clusters, we presenta model in which we use radially changing local specific frequencies for the red and blue subpopulations to fit the observations. We find that within 7' the required specific frequency of the blue clusters alone is a factor of approximately 3 larger than that of the red ones. Outside this radius however, both populations have a high local specific frequency of around 10.},

abstract = {The Hubble Deep Field provides one of the deepest multiwavelength views of the distant Universe and has led to the detection of thousands of galaxies seen throughout cosmic time. An early map of the Hubble Deep Field at a wavelength of 850micrometres, which is sensitive to dust emission powered by star formation, revealed the brightest source in the field, dubbed HDF850.1 (ref. 2). For more than a decade, and despite significant efforts, no counterpart was found at shorter wavelengths, and it was not possible to determine its redshift, size or mass. Here we report a redshift of z = 5.183 for HDF850.1, from a millimetre-wave molecular line scan. This places HDF850.1 in a galaxy overdensity at z≈5.2, corresponding to a cosmic age of only 1.1billion years after the Big Bang. This redshift is significantly higher than earlier estimates and higher than those of most of the hundreds of submillimetre-bright galaxies identified so far. The source has a star-formation rate of 850 solar masses per year and is spatially resolved on scales of 5 kiloparsecs, with an implied dynamical mass of about 1.3×10 11 solar masses, a significant fraction of which is present in the form of molecular gas. Despite our accurate determination of redshift and position, a counterpart emitting starlight remains elusive. {\textcopyright} 2012 Macmillan Publishers Limited. All rights reserved.},

The available data suggest that the intrinsic dispersion in the absolute B magnitudes of SNe Ia at maximum light is less than 0.4 mag. Hence, SNe Ia offer considerable potential for cosmological studies out to redshifts of z = 0.1 or greater. In this paper we make use of the best spectra available for type Ia supernovae in order to calculate the effect of the redshift on the observed B and V magnitudes. We present K terms in the redshift range z = 0.005-0.50 from a collection of spectra of SNe 1990N, 1991T, and 1992A covering from day -14 to day +76, counted from the time of maximum light in the blue band.

We find significant correlations between O/H and stellar mass ({\$}M{\_}*{\$}) at {\$}z\backslashsim2.3{\$} and {\$}z\backslashsim3.3{\$}.

We employ analytic chemical evolution models to place constraints on the mass and metal loading factors of galactic outflows. The efficiency of metal removal increases toward lower {\$}M{\_}*{\$} at fixed redshift, and toward higher redshift at fixed {\$}M{\_}*{\$}. These models suggest that the slope of the mass-metallicity relation is set by the scaling of the metal loading factor of outflows with {\$}M{\_}*{\$}, not by the change in gas fraction as a function of {\$}M{\_}*{\$}. The evolution toward lower O/H at fixed {\$}M{\_}*{\$} with increasing redshift is driven by both higher gas fraction (leading to stronger dilution of ISM metals) and higher metal removal efficiency, with models suggesting that both effects contribute approximately equally to the observed evolution. These results suggest that the processes governing the smooth baryonic growth of galaxies via gas flows and star formation hold in the same form over at least the past 12{\~{}}Gyr.},

abstract = {We have updated the Munich galaxy formation model to the Planck first-year cosmology, while modifying the treatment of baryonic processes to reproduce recent data on the abundance and passive fractions of galaxies from z= 3 down to z=0. Matching these more extensive and more precise observational results requires us to delay the reincorporation of wind ejecta, to lower the surface density threshold for turning cold gas into stars, to eliminate ram-pressure stripping in haloes less massive than {\~{}}10{\^{}}14 Msun, and to modify our model for radio mode feedback. These changes cure the most obvious failings of our previous models, namely the overly early formation of low-mass galaxies and the overly large fraction of them that are passive at late times. The new model is calibrated to reproduce the observed evolution both of the stellar mass function and of the distribution of star formation rate at each stellar mass. Massive galaxies (M{\textgreater}10{\^{}}11 [Msun]) assemble most of their mass before z=1 and are predominantly old and passive at z=0, while lower mass galaxies assemble later and, for M{\textless}10{\^{}}9.5 (Msun), are still predominantly blue and star forming at z=0. This phenomenological but physically based model allows the observations to be interpreted in terms of the efficiency of the various processes that control the formation and evolution of galaxies as a function of their stellar mass, gas content, environment and time.},

We find that the central stellar cores are {\$}\backslashgtrsim2{\$} times more massive than the Toomre mass, indicating they may not form via in-situ fragmentation. The stellar cores have stellar ages of {\$}0.4-0.7{\$} Gyr that are similar to the timescale of clump inward migration due to dynamical friction, suggesting that they likely instead formed through the coalescence of giant stellar clumps. While they have not yet quenched, the 6 galaxies are below the star-forming main sequence by {\$}0.2-0.7{\$} dex. Within each galaxy, we find that the specific star formation rate is lower in the central stellar core, and the stellar-mass surface density of the core is already similar to quenched galaxies of the same masses and redshifts. Meanwhile, the stellar ages of the cores are either comparable to or younger than the extended, smooth parts of the galaxies. Our findings are consistent with model predictions of the gas-rich compaction scenario for the buildup of galaxies' central regions at high redshifts. We are likely witnessing the coeval formation of dense central cores, along with the onset of galaxy-wide quenching at {\$}z{\textgreater}3{\$}.},

Using {\~{}}487,000 spaxels from galaxies observed as part of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Mapping Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey, we confirm previous results that a correlation also exists between the surface densities of star formation (Sigma{\_}SFR) and stellar mass (Sigma{\_}mass) on kpc scales, representing a `resolved' main sequence. Using a new metric (Delta Sigma{\_}SFR), which measures the relative enhancement or deficit of star formation on a spaxel-by-spaxel basis relative to the resolved main sequence, we investigate the SFR profiles of 864 galaxies as a function of their position relative to the global star forming main sequence (Delta SFR). For galaxies above the global main sequence (positive Delta SFR) Delta Sigma{\_}SFR is elevated throughout the galaxy, but the greatest enhancement in star formation occurs at small radii ({\textless} 3 kpc, or 0.5 R{\_}e). Moreover, galaxies that are at least a factor of three above the main sequence show diluted gas phase metallicities out to 2 R{\_}e, indicative of metal-poor gas inflows accompanying the starbursts. For quiescent/passive galaxies that lie at least a factor of 10 below the star forming main sequence there is an analogous deficit of star formation throughout the galaxy with the lowest values of Delta Sigma{\_}SFR in the central 3 kpc. Our results are in qualitative agreement with the `compaction' scenario in which a central starburst leads to mass growth in the bulge and may ultimately precede galactic quenching from the inside-out.},

The fundamental metallicity relation (FMR) suggests that the galaxies with higher star formation rates (SFRs) tend to have lower metallicities for a given stellar mass. To examine whether the MZR and FMR still hold at poorer metallicities and higher redshifts, we compile a sample of 35 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at {\$}0.6{\textless}z{\textless}0.9{\$} using the public spectral database ({\$}\backslashrm v5\backslash{\_}10\backslash{\_}0{\$}) of emission-line galaxies from the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS).

Due to the higher SFRs and younger stellar ages, our metal-poor SFGs deviate from the MZR and FMR in the local universe toward lower metallicities, confirming the existence of FMR, as well as the cosmic evolution of MZR and FMR with redshift.},

As a first step of the project we present multi-colour catalogues from 37 sq. degrees of the CFHTLS-Wide component. Our aims are to create astrometrically and photometrically well calibrated co-added images.

The article explains in detail data processing, multi-colour catalogue creation and photometric redshift estimation. Furthermore we apply a novel technique, based on studies of the angular galaxy cross-correlation function, to quantify the reliability of photo-z's.

abstract = {We present a detailed analysis of our ability to determine stellar masses, ages, reddening, and extinction values, and star formation rates (SFRs) of high-redshift galaxies by modeling broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) with stellar population synthesis. In order to do so, we computed synthetic optical-to-NIR SEDs for model galaxies taken from hydrodynamical merger simulations placed at redshifts 1.5 ≤ z ≤ 2.9. Viewed under different angles and during different evolutionary phases, the simulations represent a wide variety of galaxy types (disks, mergers, spheroids). We show that simulated galaxies span a wide range in SEDs and color, comparable to those of observed galaxies. In all star-forming phases, dust attenuation has a large effect on colors, SEDs, and fluxes. The broadband SEDs were then fed to a standard SED modeling procedure, and resulting stellar population parameters were compared to their true values. Disk galaxies generally show a decent median correspondence between the true and estimated mass and age, but suffer from large uncertainties ($\Delta$log M = -0.06+0.06-0.13, $\Delta$log agew = +0.03+0.19-0.42). During the merger itself, we find larger offsets: $\Delta$logM = -0.13+0.10-0.14 and Alogagew = -0.12+0.40-0.26. E(B - V) values are generally recovered well, but the estimated total visual absorption AV is consistently too low, increasingly so for larger optical depths ($\Delta$AV = -0.54+0.40-0.46 in the merger regime). Since the largest optical depths occur during the phases of most intense star formation, it is for the highest SFRs that we find the largest underestimates ($\Delta$log SFR = -0.44 +0.32-0.31 in the merger regime). The masses, ages, E(B - V), AV, and SFRs of merger remnants (spheroids) are very well reproduced. We discuss possible biases in SED modeling results caused by mismatch between the true and template star formation history (SFH), dust distribution, metallicity variations, and active galactic nucleus contribution. Mismatch between the real and template SFH, as is the case during the merging event, drives the age, and consequently mass estimate, down with respect to the true age and mass. However, the larger optical depth toward young stars during this phase reduces the effect considerably. Finally, we tested the photometric redshift code EAZY on the simulated galaxies placed at high redshift. We find a small scatter in $\Delta$z/(1 + z) of 0.031. {\textcopyright} 2009.

abstract = {We combine molecular gas masses inferred from CO emission in 500 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) between z = 0 and 3, from the IRAM-COLDGASS, PHIBSS1/2, and other surveys, with gas masses derived from Herschel far-IR dust measurements in 512 galaxy stacks over the same stellar mass/redshift range. We constrain the scaling relations of molecular gas depletion timescale (t depl) and gas to stellar mass ratio (M mol gas/M* ) of SFGs near the star formation "main-sequence" with redshift, specific star-formation rate (sSFR), and stellar mass (M* ). The CO- and dust-based scaling relations agree remarkably well. This suggests that the CO → H2 mass conversion factor varies little within ±0.6 dex of the main sequence (sSFR(ms, z, M *)), and less than 0.3 dex throughout this redshift range. This study builds on and strengthens the results of earlier work. We find that t depl scales as (1 + z)-0.3 × (sSFR/sSFR(ms, z, M *))-0.5, with little dependence on M *. The resulting steep redshift dependence of M mol gas/M * ≈ (1 + z)3 mirrors that of the sSFR and probably reflects the gas supply rate. The decreasing gas fractions at high M* are driven by the flattening of the SFR-M * relation. Throughout the probed redshift range a combination of an increasing gas fraction and a decreasing depletion timescale causes a larger sSFR at constant M *. As a result, galaxy integrated samples of the M mol gas-SFR rate relation exhibit a super-linear slope, which increases with the range of sSFR. With these new relations it is now possible to determine M mol gas with an accuracy of ±0.1 dex in relative terms, and ±0.2 dex including systematic uncertainties.

abstract = {Massive present-day early-type (elliptical and lenticular) galaxies probably gained the bulk of their stellar mass and heavy elements through intense, dust-enshrouded starbursts--that is, increased rates of star formation--in the most massive dark-matter haloes at early epochs. However, it remains unknown how soon after the Big Bang massive starburst progenitors exist. The measured redshift (z) distribution of dusty, massive starbursts has long been suspected to be biased low in z owing to selection effects, as confirmed by recent findings of systems with redshifts as high as {\~{}}5 (refs 2-4). Here we report the identification of a massive starburst galaxy at z = 6.34 through a submillimetre colour-selection technique. We unambiguously determined the redshift from a suite of molecular and atomic fine-structure cooling lines. These measurements reveal a hundred billion solar masses of highly excited, chemically evolved interstellar medium in this galaxy, which constitutes at least 40 per cent of the baryonic mass. A 'maximum starburst' converts the gas into stars at a rate more than 2,000 times that of the Milky Way, a rate among the highest observed at any epoch. Despite the overall downturn in cosmic star formation towards the highest redshifts, it seems that environments mature enough to form the most massive, intense starbursts existed at least as early as 880 million years after the Big Bang.},

abstract = {The confirmation of the presence of very massive quiescent galaxies at epochs only 1-2 Gyr after the Big Bang [1-8] has challenged models of cosmology and galaxy formation [9]. Producing sufficient numbers of these requires abundant numbers of the host dark matter halos to have been assembled and sufficient time for star formation to proceed extremely quickly and then cease just as rapidly. Ground-based spectroscopy has suggested ages of 200-300 Myr[3] at redshifts {\$}3{\textless}z{\textless}4{\$}. The true number and ages of these objects have however been highly uncertain as ground-based spectra has been limited to the brightest of them [e.g. 3, 5], at wavelengths {\~{}}2{\$}\backslashmu{\$}m, which introduces a signficant potential bias towards younger objects [7]. The launch of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) enables dramatically more sensitive and constraining spectroscopic observations due to the very low sky background, sharp image quality, and access to wavelengths beyond 2{\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m. Here we report JWST NIRSpec [10] (0.6-5.3{\$}\backslashmu{\$}m) observations of five new quiescent galaxy candidates that were beyond the limit of previous ground-based spectroscopy. The high signal:noise spectra of galaxies with continuum significantly fainter than earlier confirmations show that they are also at redshifts 3{\textless}z{\textless}4, and that they have substantial stellar masses of {\~{}}0.5-1.2x1011 M{\$}\backslashodot{\$} comparable to massive galaxies in the nearby Universe. One of the galaxies has been quenched for {\textgreater}{\~{}} 1 billion years pointing to a presence of substantially older and fainter galaxies than those revealed so far by ground-based spectroscopy. This suggests that some of the massive galaxies have very early formation epochs (during the epoch of reionization, z {\textgreater}{\~{}} 6) pointing to a need for high conversion rates of baryons to stars in the first massive galaxy halos in the early Universe [11, 12].},

abstract = {We present six galaxies at z{\~{}}2 that show evidence of Lyman continuum (LyC) emission based on the newly acquired UV imaging of the Hubble Deep UV legacy survey (HDUV) conducted with the WFC3/UVIS camera on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). At the redshift of these sources, the HDUV F275W images partially probe the ionizing continuum. By exploiting the HST multi-wavelength data available in the HDUV/GOODS fields, models of the UV spectral energy distributions, and detailed Monte Carlo simulations of the intergalactic medium absorption, we estimate the absolute ionizing photon escape fractions of these galaxies to be very high -- typically {\textgreater}60{\%} ({\textgreater}13{\%} for all sources at 90{\%} likelihood). Our findings are in broad agreement with previous studies that found only a small fraction of galaxies to show high escape fraction. These six galaxies comprise the largest sample yet of LyC leaking candidates at z{\~{}}2 whose inferred LyC flux has been cleanly observed at HST resolution. While three of our six candidates show evidence of hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN), two of these are heavily obscured and their LyC emission appears to originate from star-forming regions rather than the central nucleus. This suggests an AGN-aided pathway for LyC escape from these sources. Extensive multi-wavelength data in the GOODS fields, especially the near-IR grism spectra from the 3D-HST survey, enable us to study the candidates in detail and tentatively test some recently proposed indirect methods to probe LyC leakage -- namely, the [OIII]/[OII] line ratio and the H{\$}\backslashbeta-{\$}UV slope diagram. High-resolution spectroscopic followup of our candidates will help constrain such indirect methods which are our only hope of studying {\$}f{\_}{\{}esc{\}}{\$} at z{\~{}}5-9 in the fast-approaching era of the James Webb Space Telescope.},

abstract = {Understanding galaxy formation and evolution requires studying the interplay between the growth of galaxies and the growth of their black holes across cosmic time. Here we explore a sample of Ha-selected star-forming galaxies from the HiZELS survey and use the wealth of multi-wavelength data in the COSMOS field (X-rays, far-infrared and radio) to study the relative growth rates between typical galaxies and their central supermassive black holes, from z=2.23 to z=0. Typical star-forming galaxies at z{\~{}}1-2 have black hole accretion rates (BHARs) of 0.001-0.01 Msun/yr and star formation rates (SFRs) of {\~{}}10-40 Msun/yr, and thus grow their stellar mass much quicker than their black hole mass ({\~{}}3.3 orders of magnitude faster). However, {\~{}}3{\%} of the sample (the sources detected directly in the X-rays) show a significantly quicker growth of the black hole mass (up to 1.5 orders of magnitude quicker growth than the typical sources). BHARs fall from z=2.23 to z=0, with the decline resembling that of star formation rate density or the typical SFR. We find that the average black hole to galaxy growth (BHAR/SFR) is approximately constant for star-forming galaxies in the last 11 Gyrs. The relatively constant BHAR/SFR suggests that these two quantities evolve equivalently through cosmic time and with practically no delay between the two.},

abstract = {We present the results of a systematic study of the rest-frame UV spectroscopic properties of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs). The database of almost 1000 LBG spectra proves useful for constructing high S/N composite spectra. The composite spectrum of the entire sample reveals a wealth of features attributable to hot stars, HII regions, dust, and outflowing neutral and ionized gas. By grouping the database according to galaxy parameters such as Lyman-alpha equivalent width, UV spectral slope, and interstellar kinematics, we isolate some of the major trends in LBG spectra which are least compromised by selection effects. We find that LBGs with stronger Lyman-alpha emission have bluer UV continua, weaker low-ionization interstellar absorption lines, smaller kinematic offsets between Lyman-alpha and the interstellar absorption lines, and lower star-formation rates. There is a decoupling between the dependence of low- and high-ionization outflow features on other spectral properties. Most of the above trends can be explained in terms of the properties of the large-scale outflows seen in LBGs. According to this scenario, the appearance of LBG spectra is determined by a combination of the covering fraction of outflowing neutral gas which contains dust, and the range of velocities over which this gas is absorbing. Higher sensitivity and spectral resolution observations are still required for a full understanding of the covering fraction and velocity dispersion of the outflowing neutral gas in LBGs, and its relationship to the escape fraction of Lyman continuum radiation in galaxies at z{\~{}}3.},

abstract = {We examine the cosmic growth of the red sequence in a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation that includes a heuristic prescription for quenching star formation that yields a realistic passive galaxy population today. In this prescription, halos dominated by hot gas are continually heated to prevent their coronae from fueling new star formation. Hot coronae primarily form in halos above $\backslash$sim10{\^{}}12 M$\backslash$odot, so that galaxies with stellar masses $\backslash$sim10{\^{}}10.5 M$\backslash$odot are the first to be quenched and move onto the red sequence at z {\textgreater} 2. The red sequence is concurrently populated at low masses by satellite galaxies in large halos that are starved of new fuel, resulting in a dip in passive galaxy number densities around $\backslash$sim10{\^{}}10 M$\backslash$odot. Stellar mass growth continues for galaxies even after joining the red sequence, primarily through minor mergers with a typical mass ratio $\backslash$sim1:5. For the most massive systems, the size growth implied by the distribution of merger mass ratios is typically $\backslash$sim2$\backslash$times the corresponding mass growth, consistent with observations. This model reproduces mass-density and colour-density trends in the local universe, with essentially no evolution to z = 1, with the hint that such relations may be washed out by z $\backslash$sim 2. Simulated galaxies are increasingly likely to be red at high masses or high local overdensities. In our model, the presence of surrounding hot gas drives the trends with both mass and environment.},

Multi-Epoch Abundance Matching (MEAM) is used to define potential progenitors of a z = 0 galaxy of stellar mass 1.5 10{\^{}}11 M{\_}sun. Gas masses are derived from the 850um luminosity. Ancillary data from the CANDELS GOODS-S survey are used to derive the gas mass fractions. The results at z{\textless}=3 are mostly in accord with expectations: The detection rates are 75{\%} for the z=2 redshift bin, 50{\%} for the z=3 bin and 0{\%} for z{\textgreater}=4. The average gas mass fraction for the detected z=2 galaxies is f{\_}gas = 0.55+/-0.12 and f{\_}gas = 0.62+/-0.15 for the z=3 sample. This agrees with expectations for galaxies on the star-forming main sequence, and shows that gas fractions have decreased at a roughly constant rate from z=3 to z=0. Stacked images of the galaxies not detected with ALMA give upper limits to f{\_}gas of {\textless}0.08 and {\textless}0.15, for the z=2 and z=3 redshift bins. None of our galaxies in the z=4 and z=5 sample are detected and the upper limit from stacked images, corrected for low metallicity, is f{\_}gas{\textless}0.66.

However, even galaxies that are entirely consistent with the local nebular excitation sequence appear to be $\alpha$-enhanced – in contrast with typical local systems. Such differences must be considered when estimating gas-phase oxygen abundances at high redshift based on strong emission-line ratios. Specifically, a similarity in the location of high-redshift and local galaxies in the BPT diagram may not be indicative of a similarity in their physical properties.},

Observed H-band sizes are measured from the Cosmic Assembly Near-Infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) Hubble Space Telescope (HST)/F160W imaging. Distri-butions of individual galaxy masses and sizes illustrate that a clear mass−size relation exists up to z ∼ 7. At z ∼ 7, we find that the average galaxy size from the mass−size relation is more compact at a fixed mass of log(M * /M)= 10.1, with r 1/2,maj = 1.02 ± 0.29 kpc, than at lower redshifts.

We find that the size evolution of star-forming galaxies is well fit by a power law of the form r e = 7.07(1 + z) −0.89 kpc, which is consistent with previous works for normal star-formers at 1{\textless}z{\textless}4. In order to compare our slope with those derived Lyman break galaxy studies, we correct for different IMFs and methodology and find a slope of −0.97 ± 0.02, which is shallower than that reported for the evolution of Lyman break galaxies at z{\textgreater}4 (r e ∝ (1 + z) −1.2±0.06). Therefore, we conclude the Lyman break galaxies likely represent a subset of highly star-forming galaxies that exhibit rapid size growth at z{\textgreater}4.},

While these sources reflect only the tip of the iceberg of the black hole mass distribution, their detection challenges standard growth models. The most massive {\$}z{\textgreater}6{\$} black hole that was inferred thus far (J0100+2802, {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashbullet{\}} \backslashapprox 1.2\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}} \backslash,{\{}\backslashrm M{\_}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}) was recently claimed to be lensed, with a magnification factor {\$}\backslashmu=450{\$}. Here we perform a consistency check of this claim, finding that the detection of such source requires a bright-end slope {\$}\backslashbeta \backslashgtrsim 3.6{\$} for the intrinsic quasar luminosity function, {\$}\backslashPhi(L) \backslashpropto L{\^{}}{\{}-\backslashbeta{\}}{\$}. Commonly used values of {\$}\backslashbeta \backslashsim 2.8{\$} are rejected at {\$}{\textgreater}3\backslashsigma{\$}. If the claim is confirmed, it is very unlikely that all the remaining {\$}51{\$} sources in the SDSS sample are not magnified. Furthermore, it suffices that {\$}\backslashgtrsim 25\backslash{\%}{\$} of the remaining sources are lensed for the intrinsic luminosity function to differ significantly (i.e., {\$}{\textgreater}3\backslashsigma{\$}) from the observed one. The presence of additional extremely magnified sources in the sample would lower the requirement to {\$}\backslashsim 4\backslash{\%}{\$}. Our results urge the community to perform more extended multi-wavelength searches targeting {\$}z{\textgreater}6{\$} lensed quasars, also among known samples. This effort could vitally contribute to solve the open problem of the growth of the brightest {\$}z\backslashsim 7{\$} quasars.},

abstract = {In order for Wide-Field Infrared Survey Telescope (WFIRST) and other Stage IV dark energy experiments (e.g., Large Synoptic Survey Telescope; LSST, and Euclid) to infer cosmological parameters not limited by systematic errors, accurate redshift measurements are needed. This accuracy can be met by using spectroscopic subsamples to calibrate the photometric redshifts for the full sample. In this work we employ the Self Organizing Map (SOM) spectroscopic sampling technique, to find the minimal number of spectra required for the WFIRST weak lensing calibration. We use galaxies from the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) to build the LSST+WFIRST lensing analog sample of {\~{}}36 k objects and train the LSST+WFIRST SOM. We find that 26{\%} of the WFIRST lensing sample consists of sources fainter than the Euclid depth in the optical, 91{\%} of which live in color cells already occupied by brighter galaxies. We demonstrate the similarity between faint and bright galaxies as well as the feasibility of redshift measurements at different brightness levels. Our results suggest that the spectroscopic sample acquired for calibration to the Euclid depth is sufficient for calibrating the majority of the WFIRST color-space. For the spectroscopic sample to fully represent the synthetic color-space of WFIRST, we recommend obtaining additional spectroscopy of {\~{}}0.2-1.2 k new sources in cells occupied by mostly faint galaxies. We argue that either the small area of the CANDELS fields and the small overall sample size or the large photometric errors might be the reason for no/less bright galaxies mapped to these cells. Acquiring the spectra of these sources will confirm the above findings and will enable the comprehensive calibration of the WFIRST color-redshift relation.},

abstract = {We report on the discovery of a merger-driven starburst at z = 1.52, PACS-787, based on high signal-to-noise ALMA observations. CO(5-4) and continuum emission (850um) at a spatial resolution of 0.3" reveal two compact (r{\_}1/2 {\~{}} 1 kpc) and interacting molecular gas disks at a separation of 8.6 kpc thus indicative of an early stage in a merger. With a SFR of 991 Msun/yr, this starburst event should occur closer to final coalescence, as usually seen in hydrodynamical simulations. From the CO size, inclination, and velocity profile for both disks, the dynamical mass is calculated through a novel method that incorporates a calibration using simulations of galaxy mergers. Based on the dynamical mass, we measure (1) the molecular gas mass, independent from the CO luminosity, (2) the ratio of the total gas mass and the CO(1 - 0) luminosity (alpha{\_}CO = M{\_}gas/L'{\_}CO(1-0)), and (3) the gas-to-dust ratio, with the latter two being lower than typically assumed. We find that the high star formation, triggered in both galaxies, is caused by a set of optimal conditions: a high gas mass/fraction, a short depletion time (t{\_}depl=85 and 67 Myrs) to convert gas into stars, and the interaction of likely counter-rotating molecular disks that may accelerate the loss of angular momentum. The state of interaction is further established by the detection of diffuse CO and continuum emission, tidal debris that bridges the two nuclei and is associated with stellar emission seen by HST/WFC3. This observation demonstrates the power of ALMA to study the dynamics of galaxy mergers at high redshift.},

abstract = {With the advent of large dedicated Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) surveys, K-corrections of SNe Ia and their uncertainties have become especially important in the determination of cosmological parameters. While K-corrections are largely driven by SN Ia broad-band colors, it is shown here that the diversity in spectral features of SNe Ia can also be important. For an individual observation, the statistical errors from the inhomogeneity in spectral features range from 0.01 (where the observed and rest-frame filters are aligned) to 0.04 (where the observed and rest-frame filters are misaligned). To minimize the systematic errors caused by an assumed SN Ia spectral energy distribution (SED), we outline a prescription for deriving a mean spectral template time series which incorporates a large and heterogeneous sample of observed spectra. We then remove the effects of broad-band colors and measure the remaining uncertainties in the K-corrections associated with the diversity in spectral features. Finally, we present a template spectroscopic sequence near maximum light for further improvement on the K-correction estimate. A library of {\~{}}600 observed spectra of {\~{}}100 SNe Ia from heterogeneous sources is used for the analysis.},

abstract = {We use the optical to mid-infrared coverage of the NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey (NMBS) to characterize, for the first time, the properties of a mass-complete sample of 14 galaxies at 3.0 z {\textless} 4.0 with M star {\textgreater} 2.5 × 10 11 M , and to derive significantly more accurate measurements of the high-mass end of the stellar mass function (SMF) of galaxies at 3.0 z {\textless} 4.0. The accurate photometric redshifts and well-sampled spectral energy distributions (SEDs) provided by the NMBS combined with the large surveyed area result in significantly reduced contributions from photometric redshift errors and cosmic variance to the total error budget of the SMF. The typical very massive galaxy at 3.0 z {\textless} 4.0 is red and faint in the observer's optical, with a median r-band magnitude of r tot = 26.1, and median rest-frame U − V colors of U − V = 1.6. About 60{\%} of the mass-complete sample has optical colors satisfying either the U-or the B-dropout color criteria, although ∼50{\%} of these galaxies has r {\textgreater} 25.5. We find that ∼30{\%} of the sample has star formation rates (SFRs) from SED modeling consistent with zero, although SFRs of up to ∼1–18 M yr −1 are also allowed within 1$\sigma$ . However, {\textgreater}80{\%} of the sample is detected at 24 $\mu$m, resulting in total infrared luminosities in the range (0.5–4.0) × 10 13 L . This implies the presence of either dust-enshrouded starburst activity (with SFRs of 600–4300 M yr −1) and/or highly obscured active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The contribution of galaxies with M star {\textgreater} 2.5 × 10 11 M to the total stellar mass budget at 3.0 z {\textless} 4.0 is ∼8 +13 −3 {\%}. Compared to recent estimates of the stellar mass density in galaxies with M star ≈ 10 9 –10 11 M at z ∼ 5 and z ∼ 6, we find an evolution by a factor of 2–7 and 3–22 from z ∼ 5 and z ∼ 6, respectively, to z = 3.5. The previously found disagreement at the high-mass end between observed and model-predicted SMFs is now significant at the 3$\sigma$ level when only random uncertainties are considered. However, systematic uncertainties dominate the total error budget, with errors up to a factor of ∼8 in the densities at the high-mass end, bringing the observed SMF in marginal agreement with the predicted SMF. Additional systematic uncertainties on the high-mass end could be potentially introduced by either (1) the intense star formation and/or the very common AGN activities as inferred from the MIPS 24 $\mu$m detections, and/or (2) contamination by a significant population of massive, old, and dusty galaxies at z ∼ 2.6.},

We have spectroscopically confirmed 17 member galaxies with 11 from CO and the remaining ones from {\$}H\backslashalpha{\$}.

The presence of both a collapsed, cluster-sized halo and a predominant population of massive SFGs suggests that this structure could represent an important transition phase between protoclusters and mature clusters. It provides evidence that the main phase of massive galaxy passivization will take place after galaxies accrete onto the cluster, providing new insights into massive cluster formation at early epochs. The large integrated stellar mass at such high redshift challenges our understanding of massive cluster formation.},

abstract = {We present a detailed study of the molecular gas content and stellar population properties of three massive galaxies at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.3 that are in different stages of quenching. The galaxies were selected to have a quiescent optical/near-infrared spectral energy distribution and a relatively bright emission at 24 micron, and show remarkably diverse properties. CO emission from each of the three galaxies is detected in deep NOEMA observations, allowing us to derive molecular gas fractions Mgas/Mstar of 13-23{\%}. We also reconstruct the star formation histories by fitting models to the observed photometry and optical spectroscopy, finding evidence for recent rejuvenation in one object, slow quenching in another, and rapid quenching in the third system. To better constrain the quenching mechanism we explore the depletion times for our sample and other similar samples at z{\~{}}0.7 from the literature. We find that the depletion times are highly dependent on the method adopted to measure the star formation rate: using the UV+IR luminosity we obtain depletion times about 6 times shorter than those derived using dust-corrected [OII] emission. When adopting the star formation rates from spectral fitting, which are arguably more robust, we find that recently quenched galaxies and star-forming galaxies have similar depletion times, while older quiescent systems have longer depletion times. These results offer new, important constraints for physical models of galaxy quenching.},

abstract = {We report on work to increase the number of well-measured Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at high redshifts. Light curves, including high signal-to-noise HST data, and spectra of six SNe Ia that were discovered during 2001 are presented. Additionally, for the two SNe with z{\textgreater}1, we present ground-based J-band photometry from Gemini and the VLT. These are among the most distant SNe Ia for which ground based near-IR observations have been obtained. We add these six SNe Ia together with other data sets that have recently become available in the literature to the Union compilation (Kowalski et al. 2008). We have made a number of refinements to the Union analysis chain, the most important ones being the refitting of all light curves with the SALT2 fitter and an improved handling of systematic errors. We call this new compilation, consisting of 557 supernovae, the Union2 compilation.

abstract = {We present the first estimate of the Ly{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} luminosity function using blind spectroscopy from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer, MUSE, in the Hubble Deep Field South. Using automatic source-detection software, we assemble a homogeneously-detected sample of 59 Ly{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} emitters covering a flux range of -18.0 {\textless} log10 (F) {\textless} -16.3 (erg s{\^{}}-1 cm{\^{}}-2), corresponding to luminosities of 41.4 {\textless} log10 (L) {\textless} 42.8 (erg s{\^{}}-1). As recent studies have shown, Ly{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} fluxes can be underestimated by a factor of two or more via traditional methods, and so we undertake a careful assessment of each object's Ly{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} flux using a curve-of-growth analysis to account for extended emission. We describe our self-consistent method for determining the completeness of the sample, and present an estimate of the global Ly{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} luminosity function between redshifts 2.91 {\textless} z {\textless} 6.64 using the 1/Vmax estimator. We find the luminosity function is higher than many number densities reported in the literature by a factor of 2 - 3, although our result is consistent at the 1{\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}} level with most of these studies. Our observed luminosity function is also in good agreement with predictions from semi-analytic models, and shows no evidence for strong evolution between the high- and low-redshift halves of the data. We demonstrate that one's approach to Ly{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} flux estimation does alter the observed luminosity function, and caution that accurate flux assessments will be crucial in measurements of the faint end slope. This is a pilot study for the Ly{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} luminosity function in the MUSE deep-fields, to be built on with data from the Hubble Ultra Deep Field which will increase the size of our sample by almost a factor of 10.},

abstract = {We investigate the relationship between the black hole accretion rate (BHAR) and star-formation rate (SFR) for Milky Way (MW) and Andromeda (M31)-mass progenitors from z = 0.2 - 2.5. We source galaxies from the Ks-band selected ZFOURGE survey, which includes multi-wavelenth data spanning 0.3 - 160um. We use decomposition software to split the observed SEDs of our galaxies into their active galactic nuclei (AGN) and star-forming components, which allows us to estimate BHARs and SFRs from the infrared (IR). We perform tests to check the robustness of these estimates, including a comparison to BHARs and SFRs derived from X-ray stacking and far-IR analysis, respectively. We find as the progenit- ors evolve, their relative black hole-galaxy growth (i.e. their BHAR/SFR ratio) increases from low to high redshift. The MW-mass progenitors exhibit a log-log slope of 0.64 +/- 0.11, while the M31-mass progenitors are 0.39 +/- 0.08. This result contrasts with previous studies that find an almost flat slope when adopting X-ray/AGN-selected or mass-limited samples and is likely due to their use of a broad mixture of galaxies with different evolutionary histories. Our use of progenitor-matched samples highlights the potential importance of carefully selecting progenitors when searching for evolutionary relationships between BHAR/SFRs. Additionally, our finding that BHAR/SFR ratios do not track the rate at which progenitors quench casts doubts over the idea that the suppression of star-formation is predominantly driven by luminous AGN feedback (i.e. high BHARs).},

abstract = {We compare mass-selected close pairs at z {\textless} 1 with the intrinsic galaxy merger rate in the Illustris Simulations. To do so, we construct three 140 arcmin2 lightcone catalogues and measure pair fractions, finding that they change little or decrease with increasing redshift at z {\textless} 1. Consistent with current surveys, this trend requires a decrease in the merger-pair observability time, roughly as t$\alpha$(1 + z)-2, in order to measure the merger rates of the same galaxies. This implies that major mergers are more common at high redshift than implied by the simplest arguments assuming a constant observability time. Several effects contribute to this trend: (1) The fraction of massive, major (4:1) pairs that merge by today increases weakly from {\~{}}0.5 at z = 1 to {\~{}}0.8 at z = 3. (2) The median time elapsed between an observed pair and final remnant decreases by a factor of 2 from z {\~{}} 1 to 3. (3) An increasing specific star formation rate decreases the time during which common stellar-mass-based pair selection criteria could identify the mergers. The average orbit of the pairs at observation time varies only weakly, suggesting that the dynamical time is not varying enough to account by itself for the pair fraction trends. Merging pairs reside in dense regions, having overdensity $\delta$ {\~{}} 10 to {\~{}}100 times greater than the average massive galaxy. We forward model the pairs to reconstruct the merger remnant production rate, showing that it is consistent with a rapid increase in galaxy merger rates at z {\textless} 1.},

abstract = {During the first 500 million years of cosmic history, the first stars and galaxies formed and seeded the cosmos with heavy elements. These early galaxies illuminated the transition from the cosmic "dark ages" to the reionization of the intergalactic medium. This transitional period has been largely inaccessible to direct observation until the recent commissioning of JWST, which has extended our observational reach into that epoch. Excitingly, the first JWST science observations uncovered a surprisingly high abundance of early star-forming galaxies. However, the distances (redshifts) of these galaxies were, by necessity, estimated from multi-band photometry. Photometric redshifts, while generally robust, can suffer from uncertainties and/or degeneracies. Spectroscopic measurements of the precise redshifts are required to validate these sources and to reliably quantify their space densities, stellar masses, and star formation rates, which provide powerful constraints on galaxy formation models and cosmology. Here we present the results of JWST follow-up spectroscopy of a small sample of galaxies suspected to be amongst the most distant yet observed. We confirm redshifts z {\textgreater} 10 for two galaxies, including one of the first bright JWST-discovered candidates with z = 11.4, and show that another galaxy with suggested z {\~{}} 16 instead has z = 4.9, with strong emission lines that mimic the expected colors of more distant objects. These results reinforce the evidence for the rapid production of luminous galaxies in the very young Universe, while also highlighting the necessity of spectroscopic verification for remarkable candidates.},

abstract = {Dust attenuation affects nearly all observational aspects of galaxy evolution, yet very little is known about the form of the dust-attenuation law in the distant Universe. Here, we model the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies at z = 1.5--3 from CANDELS with rest-frame UV to near-IR imaging under different assumptions about the dust law, and compare the amount of inferred attenuated light with the observed infrared (IR) luminosities. Some individual galaxies show strong Bayesian evidence in preference of one dust law over another, and this preference agrees with their observed location on the plane of infrared excess (IRX, {\$}L{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}TIR{\}}{\}}/L{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}UV{\}}{\}}{\$}) and UV slope ({\$}\backslashbeta{\$}). We generalize the shape of the dust law with an empirical model, {\$}A{\_}{\{}\backslashlambda,\backslashdelta{\}}=E(B-V)\backslash k{\_}\backslashlambda\backslash (\backslashlambda/\backslashlambda{\_}V){\^{}}\backslashdelta{\$} where {\$}k{\_}\backslashlambda{\$} is the dust law of Calzetti et al.

Surprisingly, the galaxies in our sample show no correlation between the shape of the dust law and stellar mass, star-formation rate, or {\$}\backslashbeta{\$}. The change in the dust law with color excess is consistent with a model where attenuation is caused by by scattering, a mixed star-dust geometry, and/or trends with stellar population age, metallicity, and dust grain size. This rest-frame UV-to-near-IR method shows potential to constrain the dust law at even higher ({\$}z{\textgreater}3{\$}) redshifts.},

abstract = {Context. Our Local Group of galaxies appears to be moving relative to the Cosmic Microwave Background with the source of the peculiar motion still uncertain. While in the past this has been studied mostly using galaxies as distance indicators, the weight of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) has increased recently with the continuously improving statistics of available low-redshift supernovae. Aims. We measured the bulk flow in the nearby universe (0.015 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.1) using 117 SNe Ia observed by the Nearby Supernova Factory, as well as the Union2 compilation of SN Ia data already in the literature. Methods. The bulk flow velocity was determined from SN data binned in redshift shells by including a coherent motion (dipole) in a cosmological fit. Additionally, a method of spatially smoothing the Hubble residuals was used to verify the results of the dipole fit. To constrain the location and mass of a potential mass concentration (e.g. the Shapley Supercluster) responsible for the peculiar motion, we fit a Hubble law modified by adding an additional mass concentration. Results. The analysis shows a bulk flow consistent with the direction of the CMB dipole up to z {\~{}} 0.06, thereby doubling the volume over which conventional distance measures have sensitivity to a bulk flow. We see no significant turnover behind the center of the Shapley Supercluster. A simple attractor model in the proximity of the Shapley Supercluster is only marginally consistent with our data, suggesting the need for another, more distant, source. In the redshift shell 0.06 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.1, we constrain the bulk flow velocity to {\textless} 240 km/s (68{\%} confidence level) for the direction of the CMB dipole, in contradiction to recent claims of the existence of a large amplitude dark flow.},

Methods: Photometric redshift distributions along with simulations allow us to de-project the angular correlation measurements and estimate physical quantities such as the correlation length, halo mass, galaxy bias, and halo occupation as a function of UV luminosity. Results: For the first time we detect a significant one-halo term in the correlation function at z˜5. The comoving correlation lengths and halo masses of LBGs are found to decrease with decreasing rest-frame UV-luminosity. No significant redshift evolution is found in either quantity. The typical halo mass hosting an LBG is M⪆1012{\~{}}h-1{\~{}}M{\_}{\&}sun; and the halos are typically occupied by less than one galaxy. Clustering segregation with UV luminosity is clearly observed in the dropout samples, however redshift evolution cannot clearly be disentangled from systematic uncertainties introduced by the redshift distributions. We study a range of possible redshift distributions to illustrate the effect of this choice. Spectroscopy of representative subsamples is required to make high-accuracy absolute measurements of high-z halo masses.

abstract = {We explore scenarios for reionizing the intergalactic medium with low galaxy ionizing photon escape fractions. We combine simulation-based halo-mass dependent escape fractions with an extrapolation of the observed galaxy rest-ultraviolet luminosity functions to solve for the reionization history from z=20 to z=4. We explore the posterior distributions for key unknown quantities, including the limiting halo mass for star-formation, the ionizing photon production efficiency, and a potential contribution from active galactic nuclei (AGN). We marginalize over the allowable parameter space using a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, finding a solution which satisfies the most model-independent constraints on reionization. Our fiducial model can match observational constraints with an average escape fraction of {\textless}5{\%} throughout the bulk of the epoch of reionization if: i) galaxies form stars down to the atomic cooling limit before reionization and a photosuppression mass of log(M{\_}h/Msol){\~{}}9 during/after reionization (-13{\textless}M{\_}UV,lim{\textless}-11); ii) galaxies become more efficient producers of ionizing photons at higher redshifts and fainter magnitudes, and iii) there is a significant, but sub-dominant, contribution by AGN at z {\textless} 7. In this model the faintest galaxies (M{\_}UV{\textgreater}-15) dominate the ionizing emissivity, leading to an earlier start to reionization and a smoother evolution of the ionized volume filling fraction than models which assume a single escape fraction at all redshifts and luminosities. The ionizing emissivity from this model is consistent with observations at z=4-5 (and below, when extrapolated), in contrast to some models which assume a single escape fraction. Our predicted ionized volume filling fraction at z=7 of Q{\_}HII=78{\%} (+$\backslash$- 8{\%}) is in {\~{}}1-2 sigma tension with observations of Lya emitters at z{\~{}}7 and the damping wing analyses of the two known z{\textgreater}7 quasars, which prefer Q{\_}HII,z=7{\~{}}40-50{\%}.},

We explore the effects of different feedback prescriptions (supernova driven galactic winds and AGN feedback), initial stellar mass functions and metal cooling. We show that our fiducial model, with strong energy-driven winds and early AGN feedback, is able to reproduce the observed stellar mass function obtained from Lyman-break selected samples of star forming galaxies at redshift 6 {\textless} z {\textless} 7. At z {\~{}} 4, observed estimates of the GSMF vary according to how the sample was selected. Our simulations are more consistent with recent results from K-selected samples, which provide a better proxy of stellar masses and are more complete at the high mass end of the distribution. We find that in some cases simulated and observed SFR-M* relations are in tension, and this can lead to numerical predictions for the GSMF in excess of the GSMF observed. By combining the simulated SFR(M*) relationship with the observed star formation rate function at a given redshift, we argue that this disagreement may be the result of the uncertainty in the SFR-M* (Luv-M*) conversion. Our simulations predict a population of faint galaxies not seen by current observations.},

Our sample consists of {\~{}}400 quiescent galaxies at {\$}1.0\backslashle z\backslashle2.5{\$} and {\$}10.1 \backslashle \backslashlog{\{}M{\_}*/M{\_}\backslashodot{\}}\backslashle11.6{\$} in three CANDELS fields. We exploit deep multi-band HST imaging to derive accurate mass profiles and color gradients, then use an empirical calibration from rest-frame UVJ colors to estimate galaxy ages. We find that -- contrary to previous results -- the youngest quiescent galaxies are not significantly smaller than older quiescent galaxies at fixed stellar mass. These `post-starburst' galaxies only appear smaller in half-light radii because they have systematically flatter color gradients. The strength of color gradients in quiescent galaxies is a clear function of age, with older galaxies exhibiting stronger negative color gradients (i.e., redder centers). Furthermore, we find that the central mass surface density {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}1{\$} is independent of age at fixed stellar mass, and only weakly depends on redshift. This finding implies that the central mass profiles of quiescent galaxies do not significantly change with age; however, we find that older quiescent galaxies have additional mass at large radii. Our results support the idea that building a massive core is a necessary requirement for quenching beyond {\$}z=1{\$}, and indicate that post-starburst galaxies are the result of a rapid quenching process that requires structural change. Furthermore, our observed color gradient and mass profile evolution supports a scenario where quiescent galaxies grow inside-out via minor mergers.},

In the IR, these exposure times yield a continuum signal-to-noise ratio of 5per resolution element at H 140 ∼ 23.1 and a 5$\sigma$ emission-line sensitivity of ∼5 × 10 -17 erg s -1 cm -2 for typical objects, improving by a factor of ∼2 for compact sources in images with low sky background levels. The WFC3/G141 spectra provide continuous wavelength coverage from 1.1 to 1.6 $\mu$m at a spatial resolution of ∼0″.13, which, combined with their depth, makes them a unique resource for studying galaxy evolution. We present an overview of the preliminary reduction and analysis of the grism observations, including emission-line and redshift measurements from combined fits to the extracted grism spectra and photometry from ancillary multi-wavelength catalogs. The present analysis yields redshift estimates with a precision of $\sigma$(z) = 0.0034(1 + z), or $\sigma$(v) 1000kms -1. We illustrate how the generalized nature of the survey yields near-infrared spectra of remarkable quality for many different types of objects, including a quasar at z = 4.7, quiescent galaxies at z ∼ 2, and the most distant T-type brown dwarf star known. The combination of the CANDELS and 3D-HST surveys will provide the definitive imaging and spectroscopic data set for studies of the 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.5 universe until the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope. {\textcopyright} 2012.

abstract = {We present UBVRIz lightcurves of the Type Ia SN 1999ee and the Type Ib/c SN 1999ex, both located in the galaxy IC 5179. SN 1999ee has an extremely well sampled lightcurve spanning from 10 days before Bmax through 53 days after peak. Near maximum we find systematic differences {\~{}}0.05 mag in photometry measured with two different telescopes, even though the photometry is reduced to the same local standards around the supernova using the specific color terms for each instrumental system. We use models for our bandpasses and spectrophotometry of SN 1999ee to derive magnitude corrections (S-corrections) and remedy this problem. This exercise demonstrates the need of accurately characterizing the instrumental system before great photometric accuracies of Type Ia supernovae can be claimed. It also shows that this effect can have important astrophysical consequences since a small systematic shift of 0.02 mag in the B-V color can introduce a 0.08 mag error in the extinction corrected peak B magnitudes of a supernova and thus lead to biased cosmological parameters. The data for the Type Ib/c SN 1999ex present us with the first ever observed shock breakout of a supernova of this class. These observations show that shock breakout occurred 18 days before Bmax and support the idea that Type Ib/c supernovae are due to core collapse of massive stars rather than thermonuclear disruption of white dwarfs.},

Here we use a publicly available database of recently hired faculty (the Astrophysics Job Rumor Mill) to examine the amount of time astronomers typically spend in this transitory state.

Using a simple model of the labor market, we attempt to recreate this gendered difference in time spent as a postdoc. We can rule out the role of the increasing representation of women among astronomy PhDs, as well as any bias in favor of hiring female astronomers in response to efforts to diversify the faculty ranks. Instead the most likely explanation is that female astronomers are leaving the academic labor market, at a rate that is 3-4 times higher than male astronomers. This scenario explains the distinct hiring time distributions between male and female astronomers, as well as the measured percentage of female assistant professors, and the fraction of female applicants within a typical faculty search. These results provide evidence that more work needs to be done to support and retain female astronomers during the postdoctoral phase of their careers.},

Combined with current fraction of assistant professors that are female, use several models to explore different possible explanations.

Preferential hiring of women due to diversity incentives could only be the cause if the preference is 10x, and such a model predicts much higher fraction of female assistant professors.

Most likely explanation is women leaving the field at a greater/faster rate than men. Suggestions are given for retaining more women in the field.},

The H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} flux is inferred based on the offset between the IRAC 3.6 {\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m flux and that predicted from the best-fit SED. We demonstrate that the H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} flux correlates well with dust- corrected UV star-formation rate (SFR) and therefore can serve as an independent SFR indicator. However, we also find a systematic offset in the SFR{\_}H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}/SFR{\_}UV ratios for z {\~{}} 4-5 galaxies relative to local relations (assuming the same dust corrections for nebular regions and stellar light). We show that we can resolve the modest tension in the inferred SFRs by assuming bluer intrinsic UV slopes (increasing the dust correction), a rising star-formation history or assuming a low metallicity stellar population with a hard ionizing spectrum (increasing the L{\_}H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}/SFR ratio). Using H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} as a SFR indicator, we find a normalization of the star formation main sequence in good agreement with recent SED-based determinations and also derive the SFR functions at z {\~{}} 4-8. In addition, we assess for the first time the burstiness of star formation in z {\~{}} 4 galaxies on {\textless}100 Myr time scales by comparing UV and H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}-based sSFRs; their one-to-one relationship argues against significantly bursty star-formation histories. Further progress will be made on these results, by incorporating new results from ALMA to constrain the dust-obscured star formation in high-redshift UV-selected samples.},

abstract = {We present multi-band optical photometry of 94 spectroscopically-confirmed Type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) in the redshift range 0.0055 to 0.073, obtained between 2006 and 2011. There are a total of 5522 light curve points. We show that our natural system SN photometry has a precision of roughly 0.03 mag or better in BVr'i', 0.06 mag in u', and 0.07 mag in U for points brighter than 17.5 mag and estimate that it has a systematic uncertainty of 0.014, 0.010, 0.012, 0.014, 0.046, and 0.073 mag in BVr'i'u'U, respectively. Comparisons of our standard system photometry with published SN Ia light curves and comparison stars reveal mean agreement across samples in the range of {\~{}}0.00-0.03 mag. We discuss the recent measurements of our telescope-plus-detector throughput by direct monochromatic illumination by Cramer et al (in prep.). This technique measures the whole optical path through the telescope, auxiliary optics, filters, and detector under the same conditions used to make SN measurements. Extremely well-characterized natural-system passbands (both in wavelength and over time) are crucial for the next generation of SN Ia photometry to reach the 0.01 mag accuracy level. The current sample of low-z SN Ia is now sufficiently large to remove most of the statistical sampling error from the dark energy error budget. But pursuing the dark-energy systematic errors by determining highly-accurate detector passbands, combining optical and near-infrared (NIR) photometry and spectra, using the nearby sample to illuminate the population properties of SN Ia, and measuring the local departures from the Hubble flow will benefit from larger, carefully measured nearby samples.},

abstract = {The Herschel Multi-tiered Extragalactic Survey, HerMES, is a legacy program designed to map a set of nested fields totalling {\~{}}380 deg{\^{}}2. Fields range in size from 0.01 to {\~{}}20 deg{\^{}}2, using Herschel-SPIRE (at 250, 350 and 500 $\backslash$mu m), and Herschel-PACS (at 100 and 160 $\backslash$mu m), with an additional wider component of 270 deg{\^{}}2 with SPIRE alone. These bands cover the peak of the redshifted thermal spectral energy distribution from interstellar dust and thus capture the re-processed optical and ultra-violet radiation from star formation that has been absorbed by dust, and are critical for forming a complete multi-wavelength understanding of galaxy formation and evolution. The survey will detect of order 100,000 galaxies at 5$\backslash$sigma in some of the best studied fields in the sky. Additionally, HerMES is closely coordinated with the PACS Evolutionary Probe survey. Making maximum use of the full spectrum of ancillary data, from radio to X-ray wavelengths, it is designed to: facilitate redshift determination; rapidly identify unusual objects; and understand the relationships between thermal emission from dust and other processes. Scientific questions HerMES will be used to answer include: the total infrared emission of galaxies; the evolution of the luminosity function; the clustering properties of dusty galaxies; and the properties of populations of galaxies which lie below the confusion limit through lensing and statistical techniques. This paper defines the survey observations and data products, outlines the primary scientific goals of the HerMES team, and reviews some of the early results.},

abstract = {We present updated stellar population models appropriate for old ages ({\textgreater}1 Gyr) and covering a wide range in metallicities (-1.5{\textless}[Fe/H]{\textless}0.3). These models predict the full spectral variation associated with individual element abundance variation as a function of metallicity and age. The models span the optical-NIR wavelength range (0.37-2.4um), include a range of initial mass functions (IMFs) and contain the flexibility to vary 18 individual elements including C, N, O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti, and Fe. To test the fidelity of the models we fit them to integrated light optical spectra of 41 Galactic globular clusters (GCs). The value of testing models against GCs is that their ages, metallicities, and detailed abundance patterns have been derived from the HR diagram in combination with high resolution spectroscopy of individual stars. We determine stellar population parameters from fits to all wavelengths simultaneously ("full spectrum fitting"), and demonstrate explicitly with mock tests that this approach produces smaller uncertainties at fixed S/N ratio than fitting a standard set of 14 line indices. Comparison of our integrated-light results to literature values reveals good agreement in metallicity, [Fe/H]. When restricting to GCs without prominent blue horizontal branch populations we also find good agreement with literature values for ages, [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], and [Ti/Fe].},

Our rest-frame {\~{}}1kpc-scale, matched-resolution data comprise four different widely used tracers of star formation: the H-alpha emission line (from SINFONI/VLT), rest-frame UV continuum (from HST F606W imaging), the rest-frame far-infrared (from ALMA), and the radio continuum (from JVLA). Although originally identified by its modest H-alpha emission line flux, SHiZELS-14 appears to be a vigorously star-forming (SFR{\~{}}1000 M{\_}sol/yr) example of a submillimeter galaxy, probably undergoing a merger. SHiZELS-14 displays a compact, dusty central starburst, as well as extended emission in {\$}\backslashrm{\{}H{\}}\backslashalpha{\$} and the rest-frame optical and FIR. The UV emission is spatially offset from the peak of the dust continuum emission, and appears to trace holes in the dust distribution. We find that the dust attenuation varies across the spatial extent of the galaxy, reaching a peak of at least A{\_}H-alpha{\~{}}5 in the most dusty regions, although the extinction in the central starburst is likely to be much higher. Global star-formation rates inferred using standard calibrations for the different tracers vary from {\~{}}10-1000 M{\_}sol/yr, and are particularly discrepant in the galaxy's dusty centre. This galaxy highlights the biased view of the evolution of star-forming galaxies provided by shorter wavelength data.},

abstract = {We present a two-dimensional (2D) fitting algorithm (GALFIT, ver. 3) with new capabilities to study the structural components of galaxies and other astronomical objects in digital images. Our technique improves on previous 2D fitting algorithms by allowing for irregular, curved, logarithmic and power-law spirals, ring, and truncated shapes in otherwise traditional parametric functions like the S{\'{e}}rsic, Moffat, King, Ferrer, etc., profiles. One can mix and match these new shape features freely, with or without constraints, and apply them to an arbitrary number of model components of numerous profile types, so as to produce realistic-looking galaxy model images. Yet, despite the potential for extreme complexity, the meaning of the key parameters like the S{\'{e}}rsic index, effective radius, or luminosity remains intuitive and essentially unchanged. The new features have an interesting potential for use to quantify the degree of asymmetry of galaxies, to quantify low surface brightness tidal features beneath and beyond luminous galaxies, to allow more realistic decompositions of galaxy subcomponents in the presence of strong rings and spiral arms, and to enable ways to gauge the uncertainties when decomposing galaxy subcomponents. We illustrate these new features by way of several case studies that display various levels of complexity. {\textcopyright} 2010. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

Combining HST ACS, VLT ISAAC and Spitzer IRAC photometric data, we develop a color selection technique to identify candidates for being evolved galaxies at high redshifts. The color selection is primarily based on locating the Balmer-break using the K- and 3.6micron bands. Stellar population synthesis models are fitted to the SEDs of these galaxies to identify the final sample. We find 11 candidates with photometric redshifts in the range 4.9 9. One candidate has a spectroscopically confirmed redshift, in good agreement with our photometric redshift. The galaxies are very compact, with half-light radii in the observed K-band smaller than {\~{}}2 kpc. Seven of the 11 candidates are also detected at 24micron with the MIPS instrument on Spitzer. The 24micron emission could be interpreted as PAH emission from a dusty starburst at z{\~{}}2-3, however, it is also consistent with the presence of an obscured AGN at z{\textgreater}5. We estimate the completeness of the Balmer break galaxy sample to be {\~{}}40{\%}.

abstract = {Context. Absorption by molecules in the Earth's atmosphere strongly affects ground-based astronomical observations. The resulting absorption line strength and shape depend on the highly variable physical state of the atmosphere, i.e. pressure, temperature, and mixing ratio of the different molecules involved. Usually, supplementary observations of so-called telluric standard stars (TSS) are needed to correct for this effect, which is expensive in terms of telescope time. We have developed the software package molecfit to provide synthetic transmission spectra based on parameters obtained by fitting narrow ranges of the observed spectra of scientific objects. These spectra are calculated by means of the radiative transfer code LBLRTM and an atmospheric model. In this way, the telluric absorption correction for suitable objects can be performed without any additional calibration observations of TSS. Aims. We evaluate the quality of the telluric absorption correction using molecfit with a set of archival ESO-VLT/X-Shooter visible and near-infrared spectra. Methods. Thanks to the wavelength coverage from the U to the K band, X-Shooter is well suited to investigate the quality of the telluric absorption correction with respect to the observing conditions, the instrumental set-up, input parameters of the code, the signal-to-noise of the input spectrum, and the atmospheric profiles. These investigations are based on two figures of merit, Ioff and Ires, that describe the systematic offsets and the remaining small-scale residuals of the corrections. We also compare the quality of the telluric absorption correction achieved with molecfit to the classical method based on a telluric standard star. Results. The evaluation of the telluric correction with molecfit shows a convincing removal of atmospheric absorption features. The comparison with the classical method reveals that molecfit performs better because it is not prone to the bad continuum reconstruction, noise, and intrinsic spectral features introduced by the telluric standard star. Conclusions. Fitted synthetic transmission spectra are an excellent alternative to the correction based on telluric standard stars. Moreover, molecfit offers wide flexibility for adaption to various instruments and observing sites.},

abstract = {We use a spectroscopic sample of 286 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at 1{\textless}z{\textless}3 from the GMASS survey to study different star formation rate (SFR) estimators. Infrared (IR) data are used to derive empirical calibrations to correct ultraviolet (UV) and [OII]{\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}3727 luminosities for dust extinction and dust-corrected estimates of SFR. In the selection procedure we fully exploit the available spectroscopic information. On the basis of three continuum indices, we are able to identify and exclude from the sample galaxies in which old stellar populations might bring a non-negligible contribution to IR luminosity (LIR) and continuum reddening. Using Spitzer-MIPS and Herschel-PACS data we derive LIR for two-thirds of our sample. The LIR/LUV ratio is used as a probe of effective attenuation (AIRX) to search for correlations with continuum and spectroscopic features. The relation between AIRX and UV continuum slope ({\{}$\backslash$beta{\}}) was tested for our sample and found to be broadly consistent with the literature results at the same redshift, though with a larger dispersion with respect to UV-selected samples. We find a correlation between the rest-frame equivalent width (EW) of the [OII]{\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}3727 line and {\{}$\backslash$beta{\}}, which is the main result of this work. We therefore propose the [OII]{\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}3727 line EW as a dust attenuation probe and calibrate it through AIRX, though the assumption of a reddening curve is still needed to derive the actual attenuation towards the [OII]{\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}3727 line. We tested the issue of differential attenuation towards stellar continuum and nebular emission: our results are in line with the traditional prescription of extra attenuation towards nebular lines. A set of relations is provided that allows the recovery of the total unattenuated SFR from UV and [OII]{\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}3727 luminosities. (Abridged)},

This is attributed to differences in sample selection and definitions of size and/or mass measurements. The (u - g)rest color gradient and scatter within individual z ∼ 2 massive galaxies with ≳?1011 M⊙ are as high as in z = 0 low-mass, late-type galaxies and are consistent with the high star formation rates of massive z ∼ 2 galaxies being sustained at large galactocentric distances.},

abstract = {Using the technique of Angulo {\&} White (2010) we scale the Millennium and Millennium-II simulations of structure growth in a LCDM universe from the cosmological parameters with which they were carried out (based on first-year results from the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe, WMAP1) to parameters consistent with the seven-year WMAP data (WMAP7). We implement semi-analytic galaxy formation modelling on both simulations in both cosmologies to investigate how the formation, evolution and clustering of galaxies are predicted to vary with cosmological parameters. The increased matter density Omega{\_}m and decreased linear fluctuation amplitude sigma8 in WMAP7 have compensating effects, so that the abundance and clustering of dark halos are predicted to be very similar to those in WMAP1 for z {\textless}= 3. As a result, local galaxy properties can be reproduced equally well in the two cosmologies by slightly altering galaxy formation parameters. The evolution of the galaxy populations is then also similar. In WMAP7, structure forms slightly later. This shifts the peak in cosmic star formation rate to lower redshift, resulting in slightly bluer galaxies at z=0. Nevertheless, the model still predicts more passive low-mass galaxies than are observed. For rp{\textless} 1Mpc, the z=0 clustering of low-mass galaxies is weaker for WMAP7 than for WMAP1 and closer to that observed, but the two cosmologies give very similar results for more massive galaxies and on large scales. At z{\textgreater}1 galaxies are predicted to be more strongly clustered for WMAP7. Differences in galaxy properties, including, clustering, in these two cosmologies are rather small up to redshift 3. Given that there are still considerable residual uncertainties in galaxy formation models, it is very difficult to distinguish WMAP1 from WMAP7 through observations of galaxy properties or their evolution.},

The galaxy sample has known far-infrared luminosities and, hence, star formation rates (SFRs), and stellar masses (M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm *{\}}{\$}) from the optical-infrared spectrum fitting. The galaxies sample SFRs from the main sequence (MS) to 50 times above the MS. The derived ISM masses are used to determine the dependence of gas mass on redshift, M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm *{\}}{\$}, and specific SFR (sSFR) relative to the MS. The ISM masses increase approximately 0.63 power of the rate of increase in SFRs with redshift and the 0.32 power of the sSFR/sSFR{\$}{\_}MS{\$}. The SF efficiencies also increase as the 0.36 power of the SFR redshift evolutionary and the 0.7 power of the elevation above the MS; thus the increased activities at early epochs are driven by both increased ISM masses and SF efficiency. Using the derived ISM mass function we estimate the accretion rates of gas required to maintain continuity of the MS evolution ({\$}{\textgreater}100{\$} $\backslash$msun yr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} at z {\$}{\textgreater}{\$} 2.5). Simple power-law dependences are similarly derived for the gas accretion rates. We argue that the overall evolution of galaxies is driven by the rates of gas accretion. The cosmic evolution of total ISM mass is estimated and linked to the evolution of SF and AGN activity at early epochs.},

These systems are flagged as mergers based on features such as tidal tails, double nuclei, and asymmetry. Our sample is drawn from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey, along with a control sample of isolated galaxies at the same redshift. We consider the relationships between stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), and gas-phase metallicity for both merging and non-merging systems. In the local universe, merging systems are characterized by an elevated SFR and depressed metallicity compared to isolated systems at a given mass. Our results indicate SFR enhancement and metallicity deficit for merging systems relative to non-merging systems for a fixed stellar mass at z{\~{}}2, though larger samples are required to establish these preliminary results with higher statistical significance. In future work, it will be important to establish if the enhanced SFR and depressed metallicity in high-redshift mergers deviate from the "fundamental metallicity relation," as is observed in mergers in the local universe, and therefore shed light on gas flows during galaxy interactions.},

@article{Hutton2014,
abstract = {(Abridged) We combine NUV, optical and IR imaging of the nearby starburst galaxy M82 to explore the properties of the dust both in the interstellar medium of the galaxy and the dust entrained in the superwind. The three NUV filters of Swift/UVOT enable us to probe in detail the properties of the extinction curve in the region around the 2175A bump. The NUV colour-colour diagram strongly rules out a Calzetti-type law, which can either reflect intrinsic changes in the dust properties or in the star formation history compared to starbursts well represented by such an attenuation law. We emphasize that it is mainly in the NUV region where a standard Milky-Way-type law is preferred over a Calzetti law. The age and dust distribution of the stellar populations is consistent with the scenario of an encounter with M81 in the recent 400 Myr. The radial gradients of the NUV and optical colours in the superwind region support the hypothesis that the emission in the wind cone is driven by scattering from dust grains entrained in the ejecta. The observed wavelength dependence reveals either a grain size distribution {\$}n(a)\backslashpropto a{\^{}}{\{}-2.5{\}}{\$}, where {\$}a{\$} is the size of the grain, or a flatter distribution with a maximum size cutoff, suggesting that only small grains are entrained in the supernovae-driven wind.},

abstract = {We examine the growth and evolution of quenched galaxies in the Mufasa cosmological hydrodynamic simulations that include an evolving halo mass-based quenching prescription, with galaxy colours computed accounting for line-of-sight extinction to individual star particles. Mufasa reproduces the observed present-day red sequence reasonably well, including its slope, amplitude, and scatter. In Mufasa, the red sequence slope is driven entirely by the steep stellar mass-stellar metallicity relation, which independently agrees with observations. High-mass star-forming galaxies blend smoothly onto the red sequence, indicating the lack of a well-defined green valley at M*{\textgreater}10{\^{}}10.5 Mo. The most massive galaxies quench the earliest and then grow very little in mass via dry merging; they attain their high masses at earlier epochs when cold inflows more effectively penetrate hot halos. To higher redshifts, the red sequence becomes increasingly contaminated with massive dusty star-forming galaxies; UVJ selection subtly but effectively separates these populations. We then examine the evolution of the mass functions of central and satellite galaxies split into passive and star-forming via UVJ. Massive quenched systems show good agreement with observations out to z{\~{}}2, despite not including a rapid early quenching mode associated with mergers. However, low-mass quenched galaxies are far too numerous at z{\textless}1 in Mufasa, indicating that Mufasa strongly over-quenches satellites. A challenge for hydrodynamic simulations is to devise a quenching model that produces enough early massive quenched galaxies and keeps them quenched to z=0, while not being so strong as to over-quench satellites; Mufasa's current scheme fails at the latter.},

Keck Observatory. In conjunction with a similar dataset we obtained in the range 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.5 with the LRIS spectrograph, we analyze the kinematic and structural properties for 80 quiescent galaxies, the largest homogeneously-selected sample to date spanning 3 Gyr of early cosmic history. Analysis of our Keck spectra together with measurements derived from associated HST images reveals increasingly larger stellar velocity dispersions and smaller sizes to redshifts beyond z{\~{}}2. By classifying our sample according to Sersic indices, we find that among disk-like systems the flatter ones show a higher dynamical to stellar mass ratio compared to their rounder counterparts which we interpret as evidence for a significant contribution of rotational motion. For this subset of disk-like systems, we estimate that V/sigma, the ratio of the circular velocity to the intrinsic velocity dispersion, is a factor of two larger than for present-day disky quiescent galaxies. We use the velocity dispersion measurements also to explore the redshift evolution of the dynamical to stellar mass ratio, and to measure for the first time the physical size growth rate of individual systems over two distinct redshift ranges, finding a faster evolution at earlier times. We discuss the physical origin of this time-dependent growth in size in the context of the associated reduction of the systematic rotation.},

The environmental quenching is also more efficient in comparison to the stellar mass quenching for low mass galaxies ({\$}\backslashrm M \backslashlesssim 10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}} \backslashrm {\{}M{\}}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}) at low and intermediate redshifts ({\$}z\backslashlesssim 1.2{\$}). Our findings concur thoroughly with the "over-consumption" quenching model where the termination of cool gas accretion (cosmological starvation) happens in an over-dense environment and the galaxy starts to consume its remaining gas reservoir in depletion time. The depletion time depends on the stellar mass and could explain the evolution of environmental quenching efficiency with the stellar mass.},

abstract = {Here we present the first constraints on the prevalence of z{\textgreater}10 galaxies in the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) leveraging new NIRCam medium-band observations taken with JWST. These NIRCam observations probe redward of 1.6microns, beyond the wavelength limit of HST, allowing us to search for galaxies to z{\textgreater}10. These observations indicate that the highest redshift candidate identified over the HUDF with HST, UDFj-39546284, has a redshift of z=12.0+/-0.1, as had been suggested in multiple analyses of the HUDF12/XDF data. This source thus appears to be the most distant galaxy discovered by HST in its more than 30 years of operation. Additionally, we identify nine other z{\~{}}8-13 candidate galaxies over the HUDF, two of which are entirely new discoveries and appear to lie at z{\~{}}11 and z{\~{}}12. We use these results to characterize the evolution of the UV luminosity function (LF) from z{\~{}}15 to z{\~{}}8.7. While our LF results at z{\~{}}8.7 and z{\~{}}10.5 are consistent with previous findings over the HUDF, our new LF estimates at z{\~{}}12.6 are substantially higher than other results in the literature, potentially pointing to a milder evolution in the UV luminosity density from z{\~{}}12.6. We emphasize that our LF results are uncertain given the small number of sources in our z{\~{}}12.6 selection and limited volume probed. The new NIRCam data also indicate that the faint z{\~{}}8-13 galaxies in the HUDF/XDF show very blue UV-continuum slopes beta{\~{}}-2.7, high specific star formation rates {\~{}}24.5 Gyr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}, and high EW ({\~{}}1300A) [OIII]+Hbeta emission, with two z{\~{}}8.5 sources showing [OIII]+Hbeta EWs of {\~{}}2300 Angstroms.},

The cluster galaxies (37) are part of a confirmed system at z=2.095 and the field galaxies (53) are at {\$}1.9{\textless}z{\textless}2.4{\$}; all are in the COSMOS legacy field. There is no statistical difference between H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-emitting cluster and field populations when comparing their star formation rate (SFR), stellar mass ({\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\$}), galaxy size ({\$}r{\_}{\{}eff{\}}{\$}), SFR surface density [{\$}\backslashSigma{\$}(H{\$}\backslashalpha{\_}{\{}star{\}}{\$})], and stellar age distributions. The only difference is that at fixed stellar mass, the H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-emitting cluster galaxies are {\$}\backslashlog(r{\_}{\{}eff{\}})\backslashsim0.1{\$} larger than in the field. Approximately 19{\%} of the H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-emitters in the cluster and 26{\%} in the field are IR-luminous ({\$}L{\_}{\{}IR{\}}{\textgreater}2\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} L{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}).

Our results indicate that starbursts (+SFMS) in the cluster and field at {\$}z\backslashsim2{\$} are growing their stellar cores.

abstract = {Observational studies have widely demonstrated that galaxy physical properties are strongly affected by the surrounding environment. On one side, gas inflows provide galaxies with new fuel for star formation. On the other side, the high temperatures and densities of the medium are expected to induce quenching in the star formation. Observations of large structures, in particular filaments at the cluster outskirts (r{\textgreater}2r{\$}{\_}{\{}200{\}}{\$}), are currently limited to the low redshift Universe. We present a multi-band dataset for the cluster MACS J0416.1-2403 (z=0.397), observed in the context of the Galaxy Assembly as a function of Mass and Environment with VST (VST-GAME) survey. The project aims at gathering deep ({\$}r{\$}{\textless}24.4) and wide (20x20Mpc{\$}{\^{}}2{\$}) observations at optical wavelengths for six massive galaxy clusters at 0.2{\textless}z{\textless}0.6, complemented with near infrared data. This work describes the photometric analysis of the cluster, defines a density field and studies galaxy properties in the cluster outskirts. We extract sources paying particular attention to recover the faintest ones. We combine all the extractions in a multi-band catalog and compute photometric redshifts. We then define cluster memberships up to 5r{\$}{\_}{\{}200{\}}{\$} from the cluster core and measure the density field, comparing galaxy properties in different environments. We found that the {\$}g-r{\$} colors show bimodal behaviours in all the environments, but the peak of the distribution of red galaxies shifts toward redder colors with increasing density and the fraction of galaxies in the blue cloud increases with decreasing density. We also found 3 overdense regions in the cluster outskirts at r{\$}\backslashsim{\$}5r{\$}{\_}{\{}200{\}}{\$}. The color of galaxies suggests the presence of evolved galaxy populations, an insight for pre-processing phenomena over these substructures. We release the multi-band catalog, down to the completeness limit {\$}r{\$}{\textless}24.4 mag.},

@article{Pacifici2016,
abstract = {Although there has been much progress in understanding how galaxies evolve, we still do not understand how and when they stop forming stars and become quiescent. We address this by applying our galaxy spectral energy distribution models, which incorporate physically motivated star formation histories (SFHs) from cosmological simulations, to a sample of quiescent galaxies at {\$}0.2{\textless}z{\textless}2.1{\$}. A total of 845 quiescent galaxies with multi-band photometry spanning rest-frame ultraviolet through near-infrared wavelengths are selected from the CANDELS dataset. We compute median SFHs of these galaxies in bins of stellar mass and redshift. At all redshifts and stellar masses, the median SFHs rise, reach a peak, and then decline to reach quiescence. At high redshift, we find that the rise and decline are fast, as expected because the Universe is young. At low redshift, the duration of these phases depends strongly on stellar mass. Low-mass galaxies ({\$}\backslashlog(M{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}}/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}})\backslashsim9.5{\$}) grow on average slowly, take a long time to reach their peak of star formation ({\$}\backslashgtrsim 4{\$} Gyr), and the declining phase is fast ({\$}\backslashlesssim 2{\$} Gyr). Conversely, high-mass galaxies ({\$}\backslashlog(M{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}}/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}})\backslashsim11{\$}) grow on average fast ({\$}\backslashlesssim 2{\$} Gyr), and, after reaching their peak, decrease the star formation slowly ({\$}\backslashgtrsim 3{\$} Gyr). These findings are consistent with galaxy stellar mass being a driving factor in determining how evolved galaxies are, with high-mass galaxies being the most evolved at any time (i.e., downsizing). The different durations we observe in the declining phases also suggest that low- and high-mass galaxies experience different quenching mechanisms that operate on different timescales.},

abstract = {The presence of extremely compact galaxies at z ∼ 2 and their subsequent growth in physical size has been the cause of much puzzlement. We revisit the question using deep infrared Wide Field Camera 3 data to probe the rest-frame optical structure of 935 galaxies selected with 0.4 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5 and stellar masses M* {\textgreater} 1010.7 M {\textperiodcentered} in the UKIRT Ultra Deep Survey and GOODS-South fields of the CANDELS survey. At each redshift, the most compact sources are those with little or no star formation, and the mean size of these systems at fixed stellar mass grows by a factor of 3.5 0.3 over this redshift interval. The data are sufficiently deep to identify companions to these hosts whose stellar masses are ten times smaller. By searching for these around 404 quiescent hosts within a physical annulus 10 h -1 kpc {\textless} R {\textless} 30 h -1 kpc, we estimate the minor merger rate over 0.4 {\textless} z {\textless} 2. We find that 13{\%}-18{\%} of quiescent hosts have likely physical companions with stellar mass ratios of 0.1 or greater. Mergers of these companions will typically increase the host mass by 6{\%} ± 2{\%} per merger timescale. We estimate the minimum growth rate necessary to explain the declining abundance of compact galaxies. Using a simple model motivated by recent numerical simulations, we then assess whether mergers of the faint companions with their hosts are sufficient to explain this minimal rate. We find that mergers may explain most of the size evolution observed at z ≲ 1 if a relatively short merger timescale is assumed, but the rapid growth seen at higher redshift likely requires additional physical processes. {\textcopyright} 2012 The American Astronomical Society.

The effect of the alpha-element enhancement has been properly taken into account in the nuclear network, opacity, equation of state and, for the first time, the bolometric corrections, and color transformations. This allows us to avoid the inconsistent use - common to all alpha-enhanced model libraries currently available - of scaled-solar bolometric corrections and color transformations for alpha-enhanced models and isochrones. We show how bolometric corrections to magnitudes obtained for the U,B portion of stellar spectra for T{\_}{\{}eff{\}}{\textless}=6500K, are significantly affected by the metal mixture, especially at the higher metallicities. We also provide complete sets of evolutionary models for low-mass, He-burning stellar structures covering the whole metallicity range, to enable synthetic horizontal branch simulations. We compare our database with several widely used stellar model libraries from different authors, as well as with various observed color magnitude and color-color diagrams (Johnson-Cousins BVI and near infrared magnitudes, Stromgren colors) of Galactic field stars and globular clusters. We also test our isochrones comparing integrated optical colors and Surface Brightness Fluctuation magnitudes with selected globular cluster data. We find a general satisfactory agreement with the empirical constraints.},

abstract = {We study the ionization structure of galactic outflows in 37 nearby, star forming galaxies with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. We use the O I, Si II, Si III, and Si IV ultraviolet absorption lines to characterize the different ionization states of outflowing gas. We measure the equivalent widths, line widths, and outflow velocities of the four transitions, and find shallow scaling relations between them and galactic stellar mass and star formation rate. Regardless of the ionization potential, lines of similar strength have similar velocities and line widths, indicating that the four transitions can be modeled as a co-moving phase. The Si equivalent width ratios (e.g. Si IV/Si II) have low dispersion, and little variation with stellar mass; while ratios with O I and Si vary by a factor of 2 for a given stellar mass. Photo-ionization models reproduce these equivalent width ratios, while shock models under predict the relative amount of high ionization gas. The photo-ionization models constrain the ionization parameter (U) between -2.25 {\textless} log(U) {\textless} -1.5, and require that the outflow metallicities are greater than 0.5 Z{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}. We derive ionization fractions for the transitions, and show that the range of ionization parameters and stellar metallicities leads to a factor of 1.15-10 variation in the ionization fractions. Historically, mass outflow rates are calculated by converting a column density measurement from a single metal ion into a total Hydrogen column density using an ionization fraction, thus mass outflow rates are sensitive to the assumed ionization structure of the outflow.},

abstract = {Many semi-empirical galaxy formation models have emerged in recent years to interpret high-{\$}z{\$} galaxy luminosity functions and make predictions for next generation galaxy surveys. A common approach assumes a "universal" star formation efficiency, {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}}{\$}, which is independent of cosmic time but strongly dependent on the masses of dark matter halos hosting high-{\$}z{\$} galaxies. Though this class of models has been very successful in matching observations over much of cosmic history, simple stellar feedback models do predict redshift evolution in {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}}{\$}, and have become the de-facto recipe in semi-analytic models. In this work, we calibrate a set of universal {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}}{\$} and feedback-regulated models to the same set of rest-ultraviolet {\$}z \backslashgtrsim 4{\$} observations, and find that a rapid, {\$}\backslashsim (1+z){\^{}}{\{}-3/2{\}}{\$} decline in both the efficiency of dust production and duty cycle of star formation are needed to reconcile feedback-regulated models with current observations. By construction, these models remain nearly identical to universal {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}}{\$} models in rest-ultraviolet luminosity functions and colours. As a result, the only way to distinguish these competing scenarios is either via (i) improved constraints on the clustering of galaxies -- universal and feedback-regulated models differ in predictions for the typical galaxy bias at the level of {\$}0.1 \backslashlesssim \backslashDelta \backslashlangle b \backslashrangle \backslashlesssim 0.3{\$} over {\$}4 \backslashlesssim z \backslashlesssim 10{\$} -- or (ii) independent constraints on the dust contents and/or duty cycle of star formation.

We derive the quiescent fraction using three methods: specific star formation rate, distance from the main sequence, and UVJ colour–colour selection. All three methods give similar values at 1.5 {\textless} {\$}z{\$} {\textless} 2.0, however the results differ by up to a factor of 2 at 2.0 {\textless} {\$}z{\$} {\textless} 3.0.

By {\$}z{\$} = 2, only 3.3 Gyr after the big bang, the universe has quenched ∼25 per cent of M⋆ = 1011 M⊙ galaxies and ∼45 per cent of M⋆ = 1012 M⊙ galaxies. We discuss physical mechanisms across a range of epochs and environments that could explain our results. We compare our results with predictions from hydrodynamical simulations SIMBA and IllustrisTNG and semi-analytic models (SAMs) SAG, SAGE, and Galacticus. The quiescent fraction from IllustrisTNG is higher than our empirical result by a factor of 2–5, while those from SIMBA and the three SAMs are lower by a factor of 1.5–10 at 1.5 {\textless} {\$}z{\$} {\textless} 3.0.},

abstract = {We examine the fraction of massive (* {\textgreater}  M M 10 10) compact star-forming galaxies (cSFGs) that host an active galactic nucleus (AGN) at {\~{}} z 2. These cSFGs are likely the direct progenitors of the compact quiescent galaxies observed at this epoch, which are the first population of passive galaxies to appear in large numbers in the early Universe. We identify cSFGs that host an AGN using a combination of Hubble WFC3 imaging and Chandra X-ray observations in four fields: the Chandra Deep Fields, the Extended Groth Strip, and the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey field. We find that -+ 39.2 {\%} 3.6 3.9 (65/166) of cSFGs at {\textless} {\textless} z 1.4 3.0 host an X-ray detected AGN. This fraction is 3.2 times higher than the incidence of AGN in extended star-forming galaxies with similar masses at these redshifts. This difference is significant at the s 6.2 level. Our results are consistent with models in which cSFGs are formed through a dissipative contraction that triggers a compact starburst and concurrent growth of the central black hole. We also discuss our findings in the context of cosmological galaxy evolution simulations that require feedback energy to rapidly quench cSFGs. We show that the AGN fraction peaks precisely where energy injection is needed to reproduce the decline in the number density of cSFGs with redshift. Our results suggest that the first abundant population of massive quenched galaxies emerged directly following a phase of elevated supermassive black hole growth and further hints at a possible connection between AGN and the rapid quenching of star formation in these galaxies.},

Clustering redshifts is a method of obtaining the redshift distribution of a sample of galaxies with only photometric information by measuring the angular crosscorrelation with a spectroscopic sample in different redshift bins. We construct a spectroscopic sample containing data from the BOSS + eBOSS surveys, allowing us to recover redshift distributions from photometric data out to {\$}z\backslashsimeq 2.5{\$}.

Comparing their correlation length, r0 = 29.77 ± 2.75h−1Mpc, with the clustering of dark matter (DM) haloes in the Millennium XXL N-body simulation suggests that these z ∼ 1.6 UMPEGs reside in DM haloes of mass Mh ∼ 1014.1h−1M☉. Such very massive z ∼ 1.6 haloes are associated with the ancestors of z ∼ 0 massive galaxy clusters such as the Virgo and Coma clusters. Given their extreme stellar masses and lack of companions with comparable mass, we surmise that these UMPEGs could be the already-quenched central massive galaxies of their (proto)clusters. We conclude that with only a modest amount of further growth in their stellar mass, z ∼ 1.6 UMPEGs could be the progenitors of some of the massive central galaxies of present-day massive galaxy clusters observed to be already very massive and quiescent near the peak epoch of the cosmic star formation.},

abstract = {We introduce Meraxes, a new, purpose-built semi-analytic galaxy formation model designed for studying galaxy growth during reionization. Meraxes is the first model of its type to include a temporally and spatially coupled treatment of reionization and is built upon a custom (100 Mpc){\$}{\^{}}3{\$} N-body simulation with high temporal and mass resolution, allowing us to resolve the galaxy and star formation physics relevant to early galaxy formation. Our fiducial model with supernova feedback reproduces the observed optical depth to electron scattering and evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function between {\$}z{\$}=5 and 7, predicting that a broad range of halo masses contribute to reionization. Using a constant escape fraction and global recombination rate, our model is unable to simultaneously match the observed ionizing emissivity at {\$}z{\{}\backslashlesssim{\}}6{\$}. However, the use of an evolving escape fraction of 0.05-0.1 at {\$}z{\{}\backslashsim{\}}6{\$}, increasing towards higher redshift, is able to satisfy these three constraints. We also demonstrate that photoionization suppression of low mass galaxy formation during reionization has only a small effect on the ionization history of the inter-galactic medium. This lack of `self-regulation' arises due to the already efficient quenching of star formation by supernova feedback. It is only in models with gas supply-limited star formation that reionization feedback is effective at regulating galaxy growth. We similarly find that reionization has only a small effect on the stellar mass function, with no observationally detectable imprint at {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm *{\}}{\{}{\textgreater}{\}}10{\^{}}{\{}7.5{\}}\backslash,{\{}\backslashrm M{\_}{\{}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\}}{\}}{\$}.

abstract = {We present a family of six BVI template light curves for SNe Ia for days -5 and +80, based on high-quality data gathered at CTIO. These templates display a wide range of light curve morphologies, with initial decline rates of their B light curves between m15(B)=0.87 mag and 1.93 mag. We use these templates to study the general morphology of SNe Ia light curves. We find that several of the main features of the BVI templates correlate tightly with m15(B). In particular, the V light curves, which are probably a reasonably good approximation of the bolometric light curves, display an orderly progression in shapes between the most-luminous, slowest-declining events and the least-luminous, fastest-declining SNe. This supports the idea that the observed spectroscopic and photometric sequences of SNe Ia are due primarily to one parameter. Nevertheless, SNe with very similar initial decline rates do show significant differences in their light curve properties when examined in detail, suggesting the influence of one or more secondary parameters.},

A digression is devoted to starbursts in view of their potential relevance for measures of opacity in distant galaxies. Scarcity of coherent multiwavelength datasets hampers our ability to derive reliable obscuration estimates in intermediate and high redshift galaxies.

abstract = {(Abridged) To understand if the morphology-density and passive-density relations are already established at z{\textgreater}1.5, we study galaxies in 16 confirmed clusters at {\$}1.3{\textless}z{\textless}2.8{\$} from the CARLA survey. Our main finding is that the morphology-density and passive-density relations are already in place at {\$}z\backslashsim2{\$}. The cluster at z = 2.8 shows a similar fraction of ETG as in the other clusters in its densest region. The cluster ETG and passive fractions depend on local environment and mildly on galaxy mass. They do not depend on global environment. At lower local densities, the CARLA clusters exhibit a lower ETG fraction than clusters at z = 1. This implies that the densest regions influence the morphology of galaxies first, with lower density local environments either taking longer or only influencing galaxy morphology at later cosmological times. Interestingly, we find evidence of high merger fractions in our clusters with respect to the field, but the merger fractions do not significantly depend on local environment. This suggests that merger remnants in the lowest density regions can reform disks fuelled by cold gas flows, but those in the highest density regions are cut-off from the gas supply and will become passive ETG. The percentages of active ETG, with respect to the total ETG population, are {\$}21 \backslashpm 6\backslash{\%}{\$} and {\$}59 \backslashpm 14\backslash{\%} {\$} at 1.35 {\textless} z {\textless}1.65 and 1.65 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.05, respectively, and about half of them are mergers or asymmetric in both redshift bins. All the spectroscopically confirmed CARLA clusters have properties consistent with clusters and proto-clusters. The differences between our results and those that find enhanced star formation and star-bursts in cluster cores at similar redshifts are probably due to the different sample selection criteria, which choose different environments that host galaxies with different accretion and pre-processing histories.},

For massive galaxies, we find that the bulk of the star formation was completed prior to z=2. However, for the lower mass galaxies, the luminosity-weighted ages are significantly younger. The differential change in mass-to-light ratio correlates closely with rest-frame color, consistent with recent star formation and associated growth. Our data are consistent with mass rather than environment governing the overall growth, contrary to the expectations of hierarchical assembly. We discuss how feedback, conduction, and galaxy interactions may explain the downsizing trends seen within our large sample.},

Our main finding is that cluster passive ETG at {\$}z \backslashgtrsim 1.5{\$} with {\$}{\{}\backslashrm log{\}}(M/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}){\textgreater}10.5{\$} are systematically {\$}\backslashgtrsim 0.2-0.3{\~{}}{\{}\backslashrm dex{\}}{\$} larger than field ETGs. The passive ETG average size evolution is slower at {\$}1{\textless}z{\textless}2{\$} when compared to the field. This could be explained by differences in the formation and early evolution of galaxies in haloes of a different mass. Strong compaction and gas dissipation in field galaxies, followed by a sequence of mergers may have also played a significant role in the field ETG evolution, but not in the evolution of cluster galaxies. Our passive ETG mass-size relation shows a tendency to flatten at {\$}9.6{\textless}{\{}\backslashrm log{\}}(M/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}){\textless}10.5{\$}, where the average size is {\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}log{\}}(R{\_}e/\backslashmathrm{\{}kpc{\}}) = 0.05 \backslashpm 0.22{\$}. This implies that galaxies in the low end of the mass-size relation do not evolve much from {\$}z\backslashsim 2{\$} to the present, and that their sizes evolve in a similar way in clusters and in the field. BCGs lie on the same mass-size relation as satellites, suggesting that their size evolution is not different at redshift z {\$}\backslashgtrsim{\$} 2. Half of the active ETGs ({\$}\backslashsim 30\backslash{\%}{\$} of the ETGs) follow the field passive galaxy mass-size relation, and the other half follow the field active galaxy mass-size relation. These galaxies likely went through a recent merger or neighbor galaxy interaction, and would most probably quench at a later epoch and increase the fraction of passive ETGs in clusters. We do not observe a large population of compact galaxies, as is observed in the field at these redshifts, implying that the galaxies in our clusters are not observed in an epoch close to their compaction.},

abstract = {We investigate the well-known correlations between the dynamical mass-to-light ratio (M/L) and other global observables of elliptical (E) and lenticular (S0) galaxies. We construct two-integral Jeans and three-integral Schwarzschild dynamical models for a sample of 25 E/S0 galaxies with SAURON integral-field stellar kinematics to about one effective (half-light) radius R e. They have well-calibrated I-band Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 and large-field ground-based photometry, accurate surface brightness fluctuation distances, and their observed kinematics is consistent with an axisymmetric intrinsic shape. All these factors result in an unprecedented accuracy in the M/L measurements. We find a tight correlation of the form (M/L) = (3.80 ± 0.14) × ($\sigma$ e/200 kms -1) 0.84±0.07 between the M/L (in the I band) measured from the dynamical models and the luminosity-weighted second moment $\sigma$ e of the LOSVD within R e. The observed rms scatter in M/L for our sample is 18 per cent, while the inferred intrinsic scatter is ∼13 per cent. The (M/L)-$\sigma$ e relation can be included in the remarkable series of tight correlations between $\sigma$ e and other galaxy global observables. The comparison of the observed correlations with the predictions of the Fundamental Plane (FP), and with simple virial estimates, shows that the 'tilt' of the FP of early-type galaxies, describing the deviation of the FP from the virial relation, is almost exclusively due to a real M/L variation, while structural and orbital non-homology have a negligible effect. When the photometric parameters are determined in the 'classic' way, using growth curves, and the $\sigma$ e is measured in a large aperture, the virial mass appears to be a reliable estimator of the mass in the central regions of galaxies, and can be safely used where more 'expensive' models are not feasible (e.g. in high-redshift studies). In this case the best-fitting virial relation has the form (M/L) Vir = (5.0 ± 0.1) × R e$\sigma$ e2/(LG), in reasonable agreement with simple theoretical predictions. We find no difference between the M/L of the galaxies in clusters and in the field. The comparison of the dynamical M/L with the (M/L) pop inferred from the analysis of the stellar population, indicates a median dark matter fraction in early-type galaxies of ∼30 per cent of the total mass inside one R e, in broad agreement with previous studies, and it also shows that the stellar initial mass function varies little among different galaxies. Our results suggest a variation in M/L at constant (M/L) pop, which seems to be linked to the galaxy dynamics. We speculate that fast-rotating galaxies have lower dark matter fractions than the slow-rotating and generally more-massive ones. If correct, this would suggest a connection between the galaxy assembly history and the dark matter halo structure. The tightness of our correlation provides some evidence against cuspy nuclear dark matter profiles in galaxies. {\textcopyright} 2006 RAS.},

abstract = {Using a catalog of 147,986 galaxy redshifts and fluxes from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) we measure the galaxy luminosity density at z=0.1 in five optical bandpasses corresponding to the SDSS bandpasses shifted to match their restframe shape at z=0.1. We denote the bands {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}u{\}}, {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}g{\}}, {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}r{\}}, {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}i{\}}, {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}z{\}}, with $\backslash$lambda{\_}{\{}eff{\}} = [3216, 4240, 5595, 6792, 8111] Angstroms respectively. We use a maximum likelihood method which allows for a general form for the shape of the luminosity function, simple luminosity and number evolution, incorporates flux uncertainties, and accounts for the flux limits of the survey. We find luminosity densities at z=0.1 in absolute AB magnitudes in a Mpc{\^{}}3 of [-14.10 $\backslash$pm 0.15, -15.18 $\backslash$pm 0.03, -15.90 $\backslash$pm 0.03, -16.24 $\backslash$pm 0.03, -16.56 $\backslash$pm 0.02] in [{\{}0.1{\}}{\{}u{\}}, {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}g{\}}, {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}r{\}}, {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}i{\}}, {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}z{\}}], respectively, using $\backslash$Omega{\_}0 =0.3, $\backslash$Omega{\_}$\backslash$Lambda=0.7, and h=1, and using Petrosian magnitudes. Similar results are obtained using Sersic model magnitudes, suggesting that flux from outside the Petrosian apertures is not a major correction. In the {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}r{\}} band, the best fit Schechter function to our results has $\backslash$phi{\_}$\backslash$ast = (1.49 $\backslash$pm 0.04) $\backslash$times 10{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}} h{\^{}}3 Mpc{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}, M{\_}$\backslash$ast - 5$\backslash$log{\_}{\{}10{\}} h = -20.44 $\backslash$pm 0.01, and $\backslash$alpha = -1.05$\backslash$pm 0.01. In solar luminosities, the luminosity density in {\{}0.1{\}}{\{}r{\}} is (1.84 $\backslash$pm 0.04) h 10{\^{}}8 L{\_}{\{}{\{}0.1{\}}{\{}r{\}},$\backslash$odot{\}} Mpc{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}. Our results are consistent with other estimates of the luminosity density, from the Two-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey and the Millenium Galaxy Catalog. They represent a substantial change ($\backslash$sim 0.5 mag) from earlier SDSS luminosity density results based on commissioning data, almost entirely because of the inclusion of evolution in the luminosity function model.},

Using these expressions we have derived heavy element abundances in the {\~{}}310 emission-line galaxies from the Data Release 3 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) with an observed H$\beta$ flux F(H$\beta$) {\textgreater} 10-14 erg s-1 cm-2 and for which the [O iii] $\lambda$4363 emission line was detected at least at a 2$\sigma$ level, allowing abundance determination by direct methods. The oxygen abundance 12 + log O/H of the SDSS galaxies lies in the range from {\~{}}7.1 (Zȯ/30) to {\~{}}8.5 (0.7 Zȯ). The SDSS sample is merged with a sample of 109 blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxies with high quality spectra, which contains extremely low-metallicity objects. We use the merged sample to study the abundance patterns of low-metallicity emission-line galaxies. We find that extremely metal-poor galaxies (12 + log O/H {\textless} 7.6, i.e. Z {\textless} Zȯ/12) are rare in the SDSS sample. The $\alpha$ element-to-oxygen abundance ratios do not show any significant trends with oxygen abundance, in agreement with previous studies, except for a slight increase of Ne/O with increasing metallicity, which we interpret as due to a moderate depletion of O onto grains in the most metal-rich galaxies. The Fe/O abundance ratio is smaller than the solar value, by up to 1 dex at the high metallicity end. We also find that Fe/O increases with decreasing H$\beta$ equivalent width EW(H$\beta$). We interpret this as a sign of strong depletion onto dust grains, and gradual destruction of those grains on a time scale of a few Myr. All the galaxies are found to have log N/O {\textgreater} -1.6, implying that they have a different nature than the subsample of high-redshift damped Ly$\alpha$ systems with log N/O of {\~{}}-2.3 and that their ages are larger than 100-300 Myr. We confirm the apparent increase in N/O with decreasing EW(H$\beta$), already shown in previous studies, and explain it as the signature of gradual nitrogen ejection by massive stars from the most recent starburst.},

To identify massive () galaxies at , we consider the systematic effects on photometric redshift measurements from the introduction of an old and dusty template and of a bayesian prior on luminosity, as well as the systematic effects from different star formation histories (SFHs) and from nebular emission lines in estimated stellar population properties. Our results are most affected by the luminosity prior, while nebular lines and SFHs marginally increase the measurement dispersion; the samples include 52 to 382 galaxies, depending on the adopted configuration. Using these results we investigate, for the first time, the evolution of the massive end of the stellar mass functions (SMFs) at . Given the rarity of massive galaxies at these redshifts, cosmic variance and Poisson noise dominate the total error budget. The SMFs obtained excluding the luminosity prior show no evolution from to , indicating that massive galaxies could already be present at early epochs. The luminosity prior reduces the number of massive galaxies by 83{\%}, implying a rapid growth of massive galaxies in the first 1.5 Gyr of cosmic history. The stellar-mass complete sample includes one candidate of a very massive (), quiescent galaxy at with MIPS detection, suggesting the presence of an obscured active galactic nucleus. Finally, we show that the observed number of massive galaxies matches the number of massive galaxies at predicted by current galaxy formation models.},

abstract = {It is well established that (1) star-forming galaxies follow a relation between their star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\$}), the "star-formation sequence", and (2) the SFRs of galaxies correlate with their structure, where star-forming galaxies are less concentrated than quiescent galaxies at fixed mass. Here, we consider whether the scatter and slope of the star-formation sequence is correlated with systematic variations in the Sersic indices, {\$}n{\$}, of galaxies across the SFR-M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\$} plane. We use a mass-complete sample of 23,848 galaxies at {\$}0.5{\textless}z{\textless}2.5{\$} selected from the 3D-HST photometric catalogs.

While the slope of the log(SFR)-log(M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\$}) relation is of order unity for disk-like galaxies, galaxies with {\$}n{\textgreater}2{\$} (implying more dominant bulges) have significantly lower SFR/M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\$} than the main ridgeline of the star-formation sequence. These results suggest that bulges in massive {\$}z\backslashsim2{\$} galaxies are actively building up, where the stars in the central concentration are relatively young. At {\$}z{\textless}1{\$}, the presence of older bulges within star-forming galaxies lowers global SFR/M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\$}, decreasing the slope and contributing significantly to the scatter of the star-formation sequence.},

The ultraviolet{\`{E}}optical rest-frame SEDs of the galaxies are much bluer than those of present-day spiral and elliptical galaxies and are generally similar to those of local star-burst galaxies with modest amounts of reddening. We use stellar population synthesis models to study the properties of the stars that dominate the light from LBGs. Under the assumption that the star for-mation rate is continuous or decreasing with time, the best-Ðtting models provide a lower bound on the LBG mass estimates. LBGs with " " L * {\"{I}}{\"{I}} UV luminosities are estimated to have minimum stellar masses D1010 or roughly 1/10 that of a present-day L * galaxy, similar to the mass of the Milky Way M {\_} , bulge. By considering the photometric e ects of a second stellar population component of maximally old stars, we set an upper bound on the stellar masses that is D3{\`{E}}8 times the minimum mass estimate. The stellar masses derived for bright LBGs are similar to published estimates of their dynamical masses based on nebular emission line widths, suggesting that such kinematic measurements may substantially underestimate the total masses of the dark matter halos. We Ðnd only loose constraints on the individual galaxy ages, extinction, metallicities, initial mass functions, and prior star formation histories. Most LBGs are well Ðtted by models with population ages that range from 30 Myr to D1 Gyr, although for models with subsolar metallicities a signiÐcant minority of galaxies are well Ðtted by very young ([10 Myr), very dusty stellar populations, A(1700 mag.

We also Ðnd that the typical ages for the observed star formation events are signiÐcantly younger than the time interval covered by this red-shift range (D1.5 Gyr). From this, and from the relative absence of candidates for quiescent, non{\`{E}}star-forming galaxies at these redshifts in the NICMOS data that might correspond to the fading remnants of galaxies formed at higher redshift, we suggest that star formation in LBGs may be recurrent, with short duty cycles and a timescale between star formation events of Gyr.},

abstract = {It is now understood that the accretion of terrestrial planets naturally involves giant collisions, the moon-forming impact being a well known example. In the aftermath of such collisions the surface of the surviving planet is very hot and potentially detectable. Here we explore the atmospheric chemistry, photochemistry, and spectral signatures of post-giant-impact terrestrial planets enveloped by thick atmospheres consisting predominantly of CO2, and H2O. The atmospheric chemistry and structure are computed self-consistently for atmospheres in equilibrium with hot surfaces with composition reflecting either the bulk silicate Earth (which includes the crust, mantle, atmosphere and oceans) or Earth's continental crust. We account for all major molecular and atomic opacity sources including collision-induced absorption. We find that these atmospheres are dominated by H2O and CO2, while the formation of CH4, and NH3 is quenched due to short dynamical timescales. Other important constituents are HF, HCl, NaCl, and SO2. These are apparent in the emerging spectra, and can be indicative that an impact has occurred. The use of comprehensive opacities results in spectra that are a factor of 2 lower in surface brightness in the spectral windows than predicted by previous models. The estimated luminosities show that the hottest post-giant-impact planets will be detectable with near-infrared coronagraphs on the planned 30m-class telescopes. The 1-4um region will be most favorable for such detections, offering bright features and better contrast between the planet and a potential debris disk. We derive cooling timescales on the order of 10{\^{}}5-10{\^{}}6 Myrs, based on the modeled effective temperatures. This leads to the possibility of discovering tens of such planets in future surveys.},

We observed {\$}\backslashsim\backslash,{\$}766 emission line galaxies using the multi-slit spectrograph ESO-VLT/VIMOS in high-resolution mode (R=2500). To better extract galaxy kinematics, VIMOS spectral slits have been carefully tilted along the major axis orientation of the galaxies, making use of the position angle measurements from the high spatial resolution ACS/HST COSMOS images. We constrained the kinematics of the sub-sample at {\$}0.75{\textless}z{\textless}1.2{\$} by creating high resolution semi-analytical models. We established the stellar-mass Tully-Fisher relation at {\$}z\backslashsimeq 0.9{\$} with high-quality stellar mass measurements derived using the latest COSMOS photometric catalog, which includes the latest data releases of UltraVISTA and $\backslash$emph{\{}Spitzer{\}}. In doubling the sample at these redshifts compared with the literature, we estimated the relation without setting its slope, and found it consistent with previous studies in other deep extragalactic fields assuming no significant evolution of the relation with redshift at {\$}z\backslashlesssim1{\$}. We computed dynamical masses within the radius R{\$}{\_}{\{}2.2{\}}{\$} and found a median stellar-to-dynamical mass fraction equal to 0.2 (assuming Chabrier IMF), which implies a contribution of gas and dark matter masses of 80$\backslash${\%} of the total mass within R{\$}{\_}{\{}2.2{\}}{\$}, in agreement with recent integral field spectroscopy surveys. We find no dependence of the stellar-mass Tully-Fisher relation with environment probing up to group scale masses. This study shows that multi-slit galaxy surveys remain a powerful tool to derive kinematics for large numbers of galaxies at both high and low redshift.},

The redshifts are computed with 30 broad, intermediate, and narrowbands covering the UV (Galaxy Evolution Explorer), visible near-IR (NIR; Subaru, Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT), United Kingdom Infrared Telescope, and National Optical Astronomy Observatory), and mid-IR (Spitzer/IRAC). A $\chi$2 template-fitting method (Le Phare) was used and calibrated with large spectroscopic samples from the Very Large Telescope Visible Multi-Object Spectrograph and the Keck Deep Extragalactic Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph. We develop and implement a new method which accounts for the contributions from emission lines ([O II], H$\beta$, H$\alpha$, and Ly$\alpha$) to the spectral energy distributions (SEDs). The treatment of emission lines improves the photo-z accuracy by a factor of 2.5. Comparison of the derived photo-z with 4148 spectroscopic redshifts (i.e., $\Delta$z = z s - z p) indicates a dispersion of $\sigma${\_}{\{}$\Delta$ z/(1+z{\_}s){\}}=0.007 at i + AB {\textless} 22.5, a factor of 2-6 times more accurate than earlier photo-z in the COSMOS, CFHT Legacy Survey, and the Classifying Object by Medium-Band Observations-17 survey fields.

abstract = {We investigate the relationship between the quenching of star formation and the structural transformation of massive galaxies, using a large sample of photometrically-selected post-starburst galaxies in the UKIDSS UDS field. We find that post-starburst galaxies at high-redshift ({\$}z{\textgreater}1{\$}) show high S$\backslash$'ersic indices, significantly higher than those of active star-forming galaxies, but with a distribution that is indistinguishable from the old quiescent population. We conclude that the morphological transformation occurs before (or during) the quenching of star formation.

Our findings are consistent with a scenario in which massive passive galaxies are formed from three distinct phases: (1) gas-rich dissipative collapse to very high densities, forming the proto-spheroid; (2) rapid quenching of star formation, to create the "red nugget" with post-starburst features; (3) a gradual growth in size as the population ages, perhaps as a result of minor mergers.},

abstract = {Using star-forming galaxies sample in the nearby Universe (0.02{\textless}z{\textless}0.10) selected from the SDSS (DR7) and GALEX all-sky survey (GR5), we present a new empirical calibration for predicting dust extinction of galaxies from H-alpha-to-FUV flux ratio. We find that the H-alpha dust extinction (A(Ha)) derived with H-alpha/H-beta ratio (Balmer decrement) increases with increasing H-alpha/UV ratio as expected, but there remains a considerable scatter around the relation, which is largely dependent on stellar mass and/or H-alpha equivalent width (EW(Ha)). At fixed H-alpha/UV ratio, galaxies with higher stellar mass (or galaxies with lower EW(Ha)) tend to be more highly obscured by dust. We quantify this trend and establish an empirical calibration for predicting A(Ha) with a combination of H-alpha/UV ratio, stellar mass and EW(Ha), with which we can successfully reduce the systematic uncertainties accompanying the simple H-alpha/UV approach by {\~{}}15-30{\%}. The new recipes proposed in this study will provide a convenient tool for predicting dust extinction level of galaxies particularly when Balmer decrement is not available. By comparing A(Ha) (derived with Balmer decrement) and A(UV) (derived with IR/UV luminosity ratio) for a subsample of galaxies for which AKARI FIR photometry is available, we demonstrate that more massive galaxies tend to have higher extra extinction towards the nebular regions compared to the stellar continuum light. Considering recent studies reporting smaller extra extinction towards nebular regions for high-redshift galaxies, we argue that the dust geometry within high-redshift galaxies resemble more like low-mass galaxies in the nearby Universe.},

abstract = {Galaxy observations are influenced by many physical parameters: stellar masses, star formation rates (SFRs), star formation histories (SFHs), metallicities, dust, black hole activity, and more. As a result, inferring accurate physical parameters requires high-dimensional models which capture or marginalize over this complexity. Here we re-assess inferences of galaxy stellar masses and SFRs using the 14-parameter physical model Prospector-{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} built in the Prospector Bayesian inference framework. We fit the photometry of 58,461 galaxies from the 3D-HST catalogs at {\$}0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5{\$}. The resulting stellar masses are {\$}\backslashsim0.1-0.3{\$} dex larger than the fiducial masses while remaining consistent with dynamical constraints. This change is primarily due to the systematically older SFHs inferred with Prospector. The SFRs are {\$}\backslashsim0.1-1+{\$} dex lower than UV+IR SFRs, with the largest offsets caused by emission from "old" ({\$}t{\textgreater}100{\$} Myr) stars. These new inferences lower the observed cosmic star formation rate density by {\$}\backslashsim0.2{\$} dex and increase the observed stellar mass growth by {\$}\backslashsim 0.1{\$} dex, finally bringing these two quantities into agreement and implying an older, more quiescent Universe than found by previous studies at these redshifts. We corroborate these results by showing that the Prospector-{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} SFHs are both more physically realistic and are much better predictors of the evolution of the stellar mass function. Finally, we highlight examples of observational data which can break degeneracies in the current model; these observations can be incorporated into priors in future models to produce new {\&} more accurate physical parameters.},

abstract = {Deep pencil beam surveys ({\textless}1 deg2) are of fundamental importance for studying the high-redshift universe. However, inferences about galaxy population properties (e.g., the abundance of objects) are in practice limited by "cosmic variance." This is the uncertainty in observational estimates of the number density of galaxies arising from the underlying large-scale density fluctuations. This source of uncertainty can be significant, especially for surveys which cover only small areas and for massive high-redshift galaxies. Cosmic variance for a given galaxy population can be determined using predictions from cold dark matter theory and the galaxy bias. In this paper, we provide tools for experiment design and interpretation. For a given survey geometry, we present the cosmic variance of dark matter as a function of mean redshift z̄ and redshift bin size $\Delta$z. Using a halo occupation model to predict galaxy clustering, we derive the galaxy bias as a function of mean redshift for galaxy samples of a given stellar mass range. In the linear regime, the cosmic variance of these galaxy samples is the product of the galaxy bias and the dark matter cosmic variance. We present a simple recipe using a fitting function to compute cosmic variance as a function of the angular dimensions of the field, z̄, $\Delta$z, and stellar mass m *. We also provide tabulated values and a software tool. The accuracy of the resulting cosmic variance estimates ($\delta$$\sigma$v/ $\sigma$v) is shown to be better than 20{\%}. We find that for GOODS at z̄ = 2 and with $\Delta$z = 0.5, the relative cosmic variance of galaxies with m *{\textgreater}1011 M ⊙ is ∼38{\%}, while it is ∼27{\%} for GEMS and 12{\%} for COSMOS. For galaxies of m * 1010 M ⊙, the relative cosmic variance is ∼19{\%} for GOODS, ∼13{\%} for GEMS, and ∼6{\%} for COSMOS. This implies that cosmic variance is a significant source of uncertainty at z̄ = 2 for small fields and massive galaxies, while for larger fields and intermediate mass galaxies, cosmic variance is less serious. {\textcopyright} 2011.

It also qualitatively captures the impact of galaxy environment on the red fractions of galaxies. The internal velocity structure of selected well-resolved disk galaxies obeys the stellar and baryonic Tully-Fisher relation together with flat circular velocity curves. In the well-resolved regime the simulation reproduces the observed mix of early-type and late-type galaxies.

Our analysis is based on observations obtained with the X-Shooter instrument at the Very Large Telescope (VLT), which cover the visual and near-infrared spectrum at high (R {\textgreater} 5000) spectral resolution. We measure the values of several spectral absorptions tracing chemical species, in particular magnesium and iron, besides determining the age-sensitive D4000 break.We compare the measured indices to stellar population models, finding good agreement.

The z{\textgreater}=3.5 sample was selected down to 23 mag at 4.5 micron using photometric redshifts that have been obtained by fitting the galaxies SEDs at optical, near-IR and IRAC bands. We also require that the brightest band in which candidates are detected is the IRAC 8 micron band in order to ensure that the near-IR 1.6 micron (rest-frame) peak is falling in or beyond this band.

abstract = {We explore the relation between the dynamical mass-to-light ratio (M/L) and rest-frame color of massive quiescent galaxies out to z-2. We use a galaxy sample with measured stellar velocity dispersions in combination with Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based multi-band photometry. Our sample spans a large range in log Mdyn/Lg (of 1.6 dex) and log Mdyn/LK (of 1.3 dex). There is a strong, approximately linear correlation between the M/L for different wavebands and rest-frame color. The root-mean-square scatter in log Mdyn/L residuals implies that it is possible to estimate the M/L with an accuracy of ∼0.25 dex from a single rest-frame optical color. Stellar population synthesis (SPS) models with a Salpeter stellar initial mass function (IMF) cannot simultaneously match Mdyn/Lg versus (g-z)rest-frame and Mdyn/LK versus (g-K)rest-frame. By changing the slope of the IMF we are still unable to explain the M/L of the bluest and reddest galaxies. We find that an IMF with a slope between $\alpha$ = 2.35 and $\alpha$ = 1.35 provides the best match. We also explore a broken IMF with a Salpeter slope at M {\textless} 1 M⊙ and M {\textgreater} 4 M⊙ and a slope $\alpha$ in the intermediate region. The data favor a slope of $\alpha$ = 1.35 over $\alpha$ = 2.35. Nonetheless, our results show that variations between different SPS models are comparable to the IMF variations. In our analysis we assume that the variation in M/L and color is driven by differences in age, and that other contributions (e.g., metallicity evolution, dark matter) are small. These assumptions may be an important source of uncertainty as galaxies evolve in more complex ways.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Updated National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry Laboratory Medicine Practice Guidelines for the use of tumor markers in the clinic have been developed. METHODS: Published reports relevant to use of tumor markers for 4 cancer sites-liver, bladder, cervical, and gastric-were critically reviewed. RESULTS: Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) may be used in conjunction with abdominal ultrasound for early detection of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis associated with hepatitis B or C virus infection. AFP concentrations {\textgreater}200 microg/L in cirrhotic patients with typical hypervascular lesions {\textgreater}2 cm in size are consistent with HCC. After a diagnosis of HCC, posttreatment monitoring with AFP is recommended as an adjunct to imaging, especially in the absence of measurable disease. Although several urine markers have been proposed for bladder cancer, none at present can replace routine cystoscopy and cytology in the management of patients with this malignancy. Some may, however, be used as complementary adjuncts to direct more effective use of clinical procedures. Although carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 19-9 have been proposed for use gastric cancer and squamous cell carcinoma antigen for use in cervical cancer, none of these markers can currently be recommended for routine clinical use. CONCLUSIONS: Implementation of these recommendations should encourage optimal use of tumor markers for patients with liver, bladder, cervical, or gastric cancers.},

This J-dropout Lyman Break Galaxy, named MACS0647-JD, was discovered as part of the Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH). We observe three magnified images of this galaxy due to strong gravitational lensing by the galaxy cluster MACSJ0647.7+7015 at z = 0.591. The images are magnified by factors of {\~{}}8, 7, and 2, with the brighter two observed at {\~{}}26th magnitude AB ({\~{}}0.15 uJy) in the WFC3/IR F160W filter ({\~{}}1.4 - 1.7 um) where they are detected at {\textgreater}{\~{}} 12-sigma.

We rule out a broad range of possible lower redshift interlopers, including some previously published as high redshift candidates.

Given CLASH observations of 17 high mass clusters to date, our discoveries of MACS0647-JD at z {\~{}} 10.8 and MACS1149-JD1 at z {\~{}} 9.6 are consistent with a lensed luminosity function extrapolated from lower redshifts. This would suggest that low luminosity galaxies could have reionized the universe.

abstract = {The presence of spectroscopically confirmed Balmer breaks in galaxy spectral energy distributions (SEDs) at {\$}z{\textgreater}9{\$} provides one of the best probes of the assembly history of the first generations of stars in our Universe. Recent observations of the gravitationally lensed source, MACS 1149{\_}JD1 (JD1), indicate that significant amounts of star formation likely occurred at redshifts as high as {\$}z\backslashsimeq15{\$}. The inferred stellar mass, dust mass, and assembly history of JD1, or any other galaxy at these redshifts that exhibits a strong Balmer break, can provide a strong test of our best theoretical models from high-resolution cosmological simulations. In this work, we present the results from a cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics simulation of the region surrounding a massive Lyman-break galaxy. For two of our most massive systems, we show that dust preferentially resides in the vicinity of the young stars thereby increasing the strength of the measured Balmer break such that the simulated SEDs are consistent with the photometry of JD1 and two other {\$}z{\textgreater}9{\$} systems (GN-z10-3 and GN-z9-1) that have proposed Balmer breaks at high redshift. We find strong variations in the shape and luminosity of the SEDs of galaxies with nearly identical stellar and halo masses, indicating the importance of morphology, assembly history, and dust distribution in making inferences on the properties of individual galaxies at high redshifts. Our results stress the importance that dust may play in modulating the observable properties of galaxies, even at the extreme redshifts of {\$}z{\textgreater}9{\$}.},

In this study, for the first time, we investigate the stellar mass assembly of {\$}\backslashsim90,000{\$} low redshift, central galaxies selected from SDSS group catalogues (M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Stellar{\}}\backslashgtrsim10{\^{}}{\{}9.5{\}}{\$}M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Halo{\}}\backslashgtrsim10{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}{\$}M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}) as a function of both stellar and halo mass. We use estimates of the times at which 10, 50 and 90 per cent of the stellar mass was assembled from photometric spectral energy distribution fitting, allowing a more complete investigation than single stellar ages alone. We consider trends in both stellar and halo mass simultaneously, finding dependencies of all assembly times on both. We find that galaxies with higher stellar masses (at constant halo mass) have on average older lookback times, similar to previous studies of galaxy assembly. We also find that galaxies at higher halo mass (at constant stellar mass) have younger lookback times, possibly due to a larger reservoir of gas for star formation. An exception to this is a sub sample with high stellar-to-halo mass ratios, which are likely massive, field spirals. We compare these observed trends to those predicted by the TNG300 simulation, finding good agreement overall as a function of either stellar or halo mass. However, some differences in the assembly times (of up to {\$}\backslashsim 3{\$} Gyr) appear when considering both stellar and halo mass simultaneously, noticeably at intermediate stellar masses (M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Stellar{\}} \backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}). These discrepancies are possibly linked to the quenched fraction of galaxies and the kinetic mode AGN feedback implemented in TNG300.},

abstract = {Minor mergers have been proposed as the driving mechanism for the size growth of quiescent galaxies with decreasing redshift. The process whereby large star-forming galaxies quench and join the quiescent population at the large size end has also been suggested as an explanation for this size growth. Given the clear association of quenching with clusters, we explore this mechanism by studying the structural properties of 23 spectroscopically identified recently quenched (or "poststarburst" (PSB)) cluster galaxies at {\$}z\backslashsim1{\$}. Despite clear PSB spectral signatures implying rapid and violent quenching, {\$}87\backslash{\%}{\$} of these galaxies have symmetric, undisturbed morphologies in the stellar continuum. Remarkably, they follow a mass-size relation lying midway between the star-forming and quiescent field relations. This implies a rapid change in the light profile without directly effecting the stellar distribution, suggesting changes in the mass-to-light ratio gradients across the galaxy are responsible. We develop fading toy models to explore how star-forming galaxies move across the mass-size plane as their stellar populations fade to match those of the PSBs. Modelling a galaxy with a bulge+disc, and fading the disc from the "outside-in", can lead to the contraction in size and increase in bulge-dominance observed between star-forming and PSB cluster galaxies. Since cluster PSBs lie on the large size end of the quiescent mass-size relation, and our previous work shows cluster galaxies are smaller than field galaxies, the sizes of quiescent galaxies must grow both from the quenching of star-forming galaxies and dry minor mergers.},

abstract = {The Star Formation Rate (SFR) is one of the main parameters used to analyze the evolution of galaxies through time. The need for recovering the light reprocessed by dust commonly requires the use of low spatial resolution far-infrared data. Recombination-line luminosities provide an alternative, although uncertain dust-extinction corrections based on narrow-band imaging or long-slit spectroscopy have traditionally posed a limit to their applicability. Integral Field Spectroscopy (IFS) is clearly the way to overcome such limitation. We obtain integrated H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}, ultraviolet (UV) and infrared (IR)-based SFR measurements for 272 galaxies from the CALIFA survey at 0.005 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.03 using single-band and hybrid tracers. We provide updated calibrations, both global and split by properties (including stellar mass and morphological type), referred to H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}}. The extinction-corrected H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} luminosity agrees with the updated hybrid SFR estimators based on either UV or H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} plus IR luminosity over the full range of SFRs (0.03-20 M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} yr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}). The coefficient that weights the amount of energy produced by newly-born stars that is reprocessed by dust on the hybrid tracers, a{\$}{\_}{\{}IR{\}}{\$}, shows a large dispersion. However, it does not became increasingly small at high attenuations, as expected if significant highly-obscured H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emission would be missed. Lenticulars, early-type spirals and type-2 AGN host galaxies show smaller coefficients due to the contribution of optical photons and AGN to dust heating. In the Local Universe the H{\{}$\backslash$alpha{\}} luminosity derived from IFS observations can be used to measure SFR, at least in statistically-significant, optically-selected galaxy samples. The analysis of the SFR calibrations by galaxies properties could be potentially used by other works to study the impact of different selection criteria in the SFR values derived.},

abstract = {We utilize the CLASH (Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble) observations of 25 clusters to search for extreme emission-line galaxies (EELGs). The selections are carried out in two central bands: F105W (Y105) and F125W (J125), as the flux of the central bands could be enhanced by the presence of [O III] 4959, 5007 at redshift of about 0.93-1.14 and 1.57-1.79, respectively. The multi-band observations help to constrain the equivalent widths of emission lines. Thanks to cluster lensing, we are able to identify 52 candidates down to an intrinsic limiting magnitude of 28.5 and to a rest-frame [O III] 4959,5007 equivalent width of about 3737 angstrom. Our samples include a number of EELGs at lower luminosities that are missed in other surveys, and the extremely high equivalent width can be only found in such faint galaxies. These EELGs can mimic the dropout feature similar to that of high redshift galaxies and contaminate the color-color selection of high redshift galaxies when the S/N ratio is limited or the band coverage is incomplete. We predict that the fraction of EELGs in the future high redshift galaxy selections cannot be neglected.},

We constructed and fit the FUV--FIR SEDs of our stellar mass-selected sample of 111,537 galaxies with stellar and dust emission models using the public packages MAGPHYS and SED3FIT. From the best fit parameter estimates, we construct the star formation rate -- stellar mass relation as a function of redshift, local environment, NUVrJ color diagnostics, and morphology. We find that the shape of the main sequence derived from our color-color and sSFR-selected star forming galaxy population, including the turnover at high stellar mass, does not exhibit an environmental dependence at any redshift from 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.5. We investigate the role of morphology in the high mass end of the SFMS to determine whether bulge growth is driving the high mass turnover. We find that star-forming galaxies experience this turnover independent of bulge-to-total ratio, strengthening the case that the turnover is due to the disk component's specific star formation rate evolving with stellar mass rather than bulge growth.},

abstract = {We combine high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3 images with multi-wavelength photometry to track the evolution of structure and activity of massive (M {\textgreater} 10 10 M) galaxies at redshifts z = 1.4–3 in two fields of the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey. We detect compact, star-forming galaxies (cSFGs) whose number densities, masses, sizes, and star formation rates (SFRs) qualify them as likely progenitors of compact, quiescent, massive galaxies (cQGs) at z = 1.5–3. At z 2, cSFGs present SFR = 100–200 M yr −1 , yet their specific star formation rates (sSFR ∼ 10 −9 yr −1) are typically half that of other massive SFGs at the same epoch, and host X-ray luminous active galactic nuclei (AGNs) 30 times (∼30{\%}) more frequently. These properties suggest that cSFGs are formed by gas-rich processes (mergers or disk-instabilities) that induce a compact starburst and feed an AGN, which, in turn, quench the star formation on dynamical timescales (few 10 8 yr). The cSFGs are continuously being formed at z = 2–3 and fade to cQGs down to z ∼ 1.5. After this epoch, cSFGs are rare, thereby truncating the formation of new cQGs. Meanwhile, down to z = 1, existing cQGs continue to enlarge to match local QGs in size, while less-gas-rich mergers and other secular mechanisms shepherd (larger) SFGs as later arrivals to the red sequence. In summary, we propose two evolutionary tracks of QG formation: an early (z 2), formation path of rapidly quenched cSFGs fading into cQGs that later enlarge within the quiescent phase, and a late-arrival (z 2) path in which larger SFGs form extended QGs without passing through a compact state.},

A consensus has also emerged that most, if not all, stars form in stellar groups and star clusters and that the mass function of young star clusters in the solar neighborhood and in interacting galaxies can be described, over the mass range of a few 10 to 107 M⊙ as a power law with an exponent $\beta$ ≈ 2. These two results imply that galactic-field IMFs for early-type stars cannot, under any circumstances, be a Salpeter power law, but that they must have a steeper exponent, $\alpha$field ≳ 2.8. This has important consequences for the distribution of stellar remnants and for the chemodynamical and photometric evolution of galaxies.},

This is the first time this is done for galaxies with confirmed strong Lyman continuum escape (f esc ∼ 6–13{\%}). We find an ionizing photon production per unit UV luminosity, $\xi$ ion , that is higher by a factor 2–6 than the canonical value when reported to their observed UV luminosity. After correction for extinction, this value is close to the canonical value. The properties of our five Lyman continuum leakers are found to be very similar to those of the previously reported confirmed z = 3.218 leaker Ion2 and very similar to those of typical star-forming galaxies at z {\textgreater} ∼ 6. Our results suggest that UV bright galaxies at high-z such as Lyman-break galaxies can be Lyman continuum leakers and that their contribution to cosmic reionization may be underestimated.},

The new WFC3 ERS data provide calibrated, drizzled mosaics in the UV filters F225W, F275W, and F336W, as well as in the near-IR filters F098M (Ys ), F125W (J), and F160W (H) with 1-2 HST orbits per filter. Together with the existing HST Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) GOODS-South mosaics in the BViz filters, these panchromatic 10-band ERS data cover 40-50 arcmin2 at 0.2-1.7 $\mu$m in wavelength at 0farcs07-0farcs15 FWHM resolution and 0farcs090 Multidrizzled pixels to depths of AB sime 26.0-27.0 mag (5$\sigma$) for point sources, and AB sime 25.5-26.5 mag for compact galaxies. In this paper, we describe (1) the scientific rationale, and the data taking plus reduction procedures of the panchromatic 10-band ERS mosaics, (2) the procedure of generating object catalogs across the 10 different ERS filters, and the specific star-galaxy separation techniques used, and (3) the reliability and completeness of the object catalogs from the WFC3 ERS mosaics. The excellent 0farcs07-0farcs15 FWHM resolution of HST/WFC3 and ACS makes star-galaxy separation straightforward over a factor of 10 in wavelength to AB sime 25-26 mag from the UV to the near-IR, respectively. Our main results are: (1) proper motion of faint ERS stars is detected over 6 years at 3.06 ± 0.66 mas year-1 (4.6$\sigma$), consistent with Galactic structure models; (2) both the Galactic star counts and the galaxy counts show mild but significant trends of decreasing count slopes from the mid-UV to the near-IR over a factor of 10 in wavelength; (3) combining the 10-band ERS counts with the panchromatic Galaxy and Mass Assembly survey counts at the bright end (10 mag {\textless}{\~{}} AB lsim 20 mag) and the Hubble Ultra Deep Field counts in the BVizYsJH filters at the faint end (24 mag {\textless}{\~{}} AB lsim 30 mag) yields galaxy counts that are well measured over the entire flux range 10 mag {\textless}{\~{}} AB lsim 30 mag for 0.2-2 $\mu$m in wavelength; (4) simple luminosity+density evolution models can fit the galaxy counts over this entire flux range. However, no single model can explain the counts over this entire flux range in all 10 filters simultaneously. More sophisticated models of galaxy assembly are needed to reproduce the overall constraints provided by the current panchromatic galaxy counts for 10 mag {\textless}{\~{}} AB lsim 30 mag over a factor of 10 in wavelength.

Our approach provides an empirically-calibrated, physically-motivated model for the properties of star-forming galaxies sourcing the epoch of reionization. In the case where star formation in low-mass halos is maximally efficient, an average escape fraction {\$}\backslashsim0.1{\$} can reproduce the optical depth reported by Planck, whereas inefficient star formation in these halos requires either about twice as many UV photons to escape, or an escape fraction that increases towards higher redshifts. Our models also predict how future observations with JWST can improve our understanding of these galaxy populations.},

abstract = {We use the UV-optical color magnitude diagram in combination with spectroscopic and photometric measurements derived from the SDSS spectroscopic sample to measure the distribution of galaxies in the local universe (z{\textless}0.25) and their physical properties as a function of specific star formation rate (SSFR) and stellar mass. Throughout this study our emphasis is on the properties of galaxies on and off of a local "star-forming sequence." We discuss how the physical characteristics of galaxies along this sequence are related to scaling relations typically derived for galaxies of different morphological types. We find, among other trends that our measure of the star formation rate surface density is nearly constant along this sequence. We discuss this result and implications for galaxies at higher redshift. For the first time, we report on measurements of the local UV luminosity function versus galaxy structural parameters as well as inclination. We also split our sample into disk-dominated and bulge-dominated subsamples using the i-band Sersic index and find that disk-dominated galaxies occupy a very tight locus in SSFR vs. stellar mass space while bulge-dominated galaxies display a much larger spread of SSFR at fixed stellar mass. A significant fraction of galaxies with SSFR and SF surface density above those on the "star-forming sequence" are bulge-dominated. We can use our derived distribution functions to ask whether a significant fraction of these galaxies may be experiencing a final episode of star formation (possibly induced by a merger or other burst), soon to be quenched, by determining whether this population can explain the growth rate of the non-star-forming galaxies on the "red sequence."

abstract = {We investigate the bursty star formation histories (SFHs) of dwarf galaxies using the distribution of log({\$}L{\_}{\{}H\backslashalpha{\}}/L{\_}{\{}UV{\}}{\$}) of 185 local galaxies. We expand on the work of Weisz et al. 2012 to consider a wider range of SFHs and stellar metallicities, and show that there are large degeneracies in a periodic, top-hat burst model. We argue that all galaxies of a given mass have similar SFHs and we can therefore include the {\$}L{\_}{\{}H\backslashalpha{\}}{\$} distributions (subtracting the median trend with stellar mass, referred to as {\$}\backslashDelta \backslashtext{\{}log{\}}(L{\_}{\{}H\backslashalpha{\}}){\$}) in our analyses. {\$}\backslashDelta \backslashtext{\{}log{\}}(L{\_}{\{}H\backslashalpha{\}}){\$} traces the amplitude of the bursts, and log({\$}L{\_}{\{}H\backslashalpha{\}}/L{\_}{\{}UV{\}}{\$}) is a function of timescale, amplitude, and shape of the bursts. We examine the 2-dimensional distribution of these two indicators constrain the SFHs. We use exponentially rising/falling bursts to determine timescales ({\$}e{\$}-folding time, {\$}\backslashtau{\$}). We find that galaxies below {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}7.5{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} undergo large (amplitudes of {\$}\backslashsim 100{\$}) and rapid ({\$}\backslashtau {\textless} 30{\$} Myr) bursts, while galaxies above {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}8.5{\}}{\$} M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} experience smaller (maximum amplitudes {\$}\backslashsim 10{\$}), slower ({\$}\backslashtau \backslashgtrsim 300{\$} Myr) bursts.

Finally, we confirm that stochastic sampling of the stellar mass function can not reproduce the observed distributions unless the standard assumptions of cluster and stellar mass functions are changed.

abstract = {Quiescence in galaxies correlates strongly with the central density/morphology of the stellar distribution. We investigate two possible explanations for this morphology-quiescence relation: 1) the central density results from a dissipative core-building event (`compaction') that feeds an AGN that quenches the galaxy and 2) the central density results from inside-out growth by galaxy-wide star formation that is quenched by processes unrelated to the central density. We aim to distinguish these two scenarios using the MaNGA survey to determine profiles of stellar age, specific star formation rate (sSFR) and gas phase metallicity (O/H) as a function of stellar mass surface density within 1 kpc (Sigma{\_}1kpc) and total stellar mass (M*). We find that gradients in age, sSFR and O/H depend on the galaxy's position on the Sigma{\_}1kpc-M* diagram, suggesting two possible evolutionary pathways. The first pathway consists of galaxies with low Sigma{\_}1kpc for their M* whose centres are old, metal-rich and suppressed in sSFR compared to their outskirts, consistent with the inside-out growth scenario. The second pathway, consistent with the core-building scenario, consists of galaxies with higher Sigma{\_}1kpc for their M*, whose centres are younger, enhanced in sSFR and metal-deficient compared to their outskirts. Moreover, the WISE-selected AGN fraction peaks in the same area of the Sigma{\_}1kpc diagram as the core-building pathway. The sSFR profiles of the quiescent population suggest that galaxies on the compaction-like path quench uniformly, while those on the inside-out growing path quench their centres first. Our results imply that both pathways contribute to the morphology-quiescence relation.},

@article{Kauffmann2004,
abstract = {We use a complete sample of galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey to study how structure, star formation and nuclear activity depend on local density and on stellar mass. Local density is estimated by counting galaxies above a fixed absolute magnitude limit within cylinders 2 Mpc in projected radius and ± km s-1 in depth. The stellar mass distribution of galaxies shifts by almost a factor of two towards higher masses between low-and high-density regions. At fixed stellar mass both star formation and nuclear activity depend strongly on local density, while structural parameters such as size and concentration are almost independent of it. Only for low-mass galaxies (M* {\textless} 3 × 1010 M⊙, where M* = stellar mass) do we find a weak shift towards greater concentration and compactness in the highest-density regions. The galaxy property most sensitive to environment is specific star formation rate (SFR). For galaxies with stellar masses in the range 1010-3 ⊙ 10 10 M⊙, the median SFR/M* decreases by more than a factor of 10 as the population shifts from predominantly star-forming at low densities to predominantly inactive at high densities. This decrease is less marked, but still significant, for high-mass galaxies. Galaxy properties that are associated with star formation correlate strongly with local density. At fixed stellar mass twice as many galaxies host active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with strong [O III] emission in low-density regions as in high. Massive galaxies in low-density environments also contain more dust. To gain insight into the processes that shut down star formation, we analyse correlations between spectroscopic indicators that probe the star formation history (SFH) on different time-scales: the $\lambda$4000 break strength, the Balmer-absorption index H$\delta$A, and the specific SFR/M*. The correlations between these indicators do not depend on environment, suggesting that the decrease in star formation activity in dense environments occurs over long ({\textgreater} 1-Gyr) time-scales. Since structure does not depend on environment for galaxies with masses greater than 3 × 1010 M⊙, the trends in recent SFH, dust and nuclear activity in these systems cannot be driven by processes that alter structure, for example mergers or harassment. The SFH-density correlation is strongest for small-scale estimates of local density. We see no evidence that star formation history depends on environment more than 1 Mpc from a galaxy. Finally, we highlight a striking similarity between the changes in the galaxy population as a function of density and as a function of redshift. We use mock catalogues derived from N-body simulations to explain how this may be understood.},

abstract = {We present stellar rotation curves and velocity dispersion profiles for 104 quiescent galaxies at {\$}z=0.6-1{\$} from the Large Early Galaxy Astrophysics Census (LEGA-C) spectroscopic survey. Rotation is typically probed across 10-20kpc, or to an average of 2.7{\$}{\{}\backslashrm R{\_}e{\}}{\$}. Combined with central stellar velocity dispersions ({\$}\backslashsigma{\_}0{\$}) this provides the first determination of the dynamical state of a sample selected by a lack of star formation activity at large lookback time. The most massive galaxies ({\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\textgreater}2\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}\backslash,M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}) generally show no or little rotation measured at 5kpc ({\$}|V{\_}5|/\backslashsigma{\_}0{\textless}0.2{\$} in 8 of 10 cases), while {\$}{\{}\backslashsim{\}}64\backslash{\%}{\$} of less massive galaxies show significant rotation. This is reminiscent of local fast- and slow-rotating ellipticals and implies that low- and high-redshift quiescent galaxies have qualitatively similar dynamical structures. We compare {\$}|V{\_}5|/\backslashsigma{\_}0{\$} distributions at {\$}z\backslashsim0.8{\$} and the present day by re-binning and smoothing the kinematic maps of 91 low-redshift quiescent galaxies from the CALIFA survey and find evidence for a decrease in rotational support since {\$}z\backslashsim1{\$}. This result is especially strong when galaxies are compared at fixed velocity dispersion; if velocity dispersion does not evolve for individual galaxies then the rotational velocity at 5kpc was an average of {\$}{\{}94\backslashpm22\backslash{\%}{\}}{\$} higher in {\$}z\backslashsim0.8{\$} quiescent galaxies than today. Considering that the number of quiescent galaxies grows with time and that new additions to the population descend from rotationally-supported star-forming galaxies, our results imply that quiescent galaxies must lose angular momentum between {\$}z\backslashsim1{\$} and the present, presumably through dissipationless merging, and/or that the mechanism that transforms star-forming galaxies also reduces their rotational support.},

abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting in the far-infrared (FIR) is greatly limited by a dearth of data and an excess of free parameters - from galaxies' dust composition, temperature, mass, orientation, opacity, to heating from AGN. This paper presents a simple FIR SED fitting technique joining a modified, single dust temperature greybody, representing the reprocessed starburst emission in the whole galaxy, to a mid-infrared powerlaw, which approximates hot-dust emission from AGN heating or clumpy, hot starbursting regions. This FIR SED can be used to measure infrared luminosities, dust temperatures and dust masses for both local and high-z galaxies with 3 to 10+ FIR photometric measurements. This fitting method is compared to infrared template SEDs in the literature using photometric data on 65 local luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies, (U)LIRGs. Despite relying only on 2-4 free parameters, the coupled greybody/powerlaw SED fitting described here produces better fits to photometric measurements than best-fit literature template SEDs (with residuals a factor of {\~{}}2 lower). A mean emissivity index of beta=1.60+-0.38 and mid-infrared powerlaw slope of alpha=2.0+-0.5 is measured; the former agrees with the widely presumed emissivity index of beta=1.5 and the latter is indicative of an optically-thin dust medium with a shallow radial density profile, {\~{}}r{\^{}}-0.5. Adopting characteristic dust temperature as the inverse wavelength where the SED peaks, dust temperatures {\~{}}25-45K are measured for local (U)LIRGs, {\~{}}5-15K colder than previous estimates using only simple greybodies. This comparative study highlights the impact of SED fitting assumptions on the measurement of physical properties such as infrared luminosity (and thereby infrared-based star formation rate), dust temperature and dust mass, for both local and high-redshift galaxies.

We find a significant nonlinear slope of the relation, SFRvpropM 0.6 sstarf, and a constant observed scatter of 0.34 dex, independent of redshift and M sstarf. However, if we select only blue galaxies we find a linear relation SFRvpropM sstarf, similar to previous results at z = 0 by Peng et al. This selection excludes red, dusty, star-forming galaxies with higher masses, which brings down the slope. By selecting on L IR/L UV (a proxy for dust obscuration) and the rest-frame U - V colors, we show that star-forming galaxies fall in three distinct regions of the log(SFR)-log(M sstarf) plane: (1) actively star-forming galaxies with "normal" dust obscuration and associated colors (54{\%} for log (M sstarf) {\textgreater} 10 at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.5), (2) red star-forming galaxies with low levels of dust obscuration and low-specific SFRs (11{\%}), and (3) dusty, blue star-forming galaxies with high-specific SFRs (7{\%}). The remaining 28{\%} comprises quiescent galaxies. Galaxies on the "normal" star formation sequence show strong trends of increasing dust attenuation with stellar mass and a decreasing specific SFR, with an observed scatter of 0.25 dex. The dusty, blue galaxies reside in the upper envelope of the star formation sequence with remarkably similar spectral shapes at all masses, suggesting that the same physical process is dominating the stellar light. The red, low-dust star-forming galaxies may be in the process of shutting off and migrating to the quiescent population.},

abstract = {The local linear embedding algorithm (LLE) is a non-linear dimension-reducing technique, widely used due to its computational simplicity and intuitive approach. LLE first linearly reconstructs each input point from its nearest neighbors and then preserves these neighborhood relations in the low-dimensional embedding. We show that the reconstruction weights computed by LLE capture the high-dimensional structure of the neighborhoods, and not the low-dimensional manifold structure. Consequently, the weight vectors are highly sensitive to noise. Moreover, this causes LLE to converge to a linear projection of the input, as opposed to its non-linear embedding goal. To overcome both of these problems, we propose to compute the weight vectors using a low-dimensional neighborhood representation. We prove theoretically that this straightforward and computationally simple modification of LLE reduces LLE's sensitivity to noise. This modification also removes the need for regularization when the number of neighbors is larger than the dimension of the input. We present numerical examples demonstrating both the perturbation and linear projection problems, and the improved outputs using the low-dimensional neighborhood representation.},

abstract = {We present very deep imaging observations, through a narrow-band filter tuned to Lyman alpha at {\textless}z = 3.09{\textgreater}, of a volume containing a significant over-density of galaxies at this redshift previously discovered in our survey for continuum-selected Lyman break galaxies (LBGs). The new observations are used in conjunction with our spectroscopic results on LBGs to compare the effectiveness of continuum and emission line searches for star forming galaxies at high redshift, and to extend the search for members of the structure at {\textless}z{\textgreater}= 3.09 to much fainter continuum luminosities. We find that only 20-25 percent of all galaxies at a given UV continuum luminosity would be flagged as narrow-band excess objects subject to the typical limits W{\_}Lya {\textgreater} 80 Angstroms in the observed frame. The density enhancement of strong Lyman alpha emitters in this field is consistent with that inferred from the analysis of the spectroscopic Lyman break galaxy sample in the same region (6+/-1), but extends to continuum luminosities up to 2 magnitudes fainter. There is no evidence for a significantly higher fraction of large Lyman alpha line equivalent widths at faint continuum luminosities. By combining the 24 spectroscopic members of the z=3.09 ``spike'' with the narrow-band candidates, we are able to produce a sample of 162 objects which are either known or likely members of this large structure. We have also discovered two extremely large and diffuse Lyman alpha emitting ``blobs'', which have physical extents {\textgreater}100/h kpc and Lyman alpha line fluxes 20-40 times larger than the typical line emitters at the same redshifts in the field. The possible nature of the ``blobs'' is discussed. (abstract abridged)},

abstract = {We derive stellar metallicities, light-weighted ages and stellar masses for a magnitude-limited sample of 175 128 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release Two (SDSS DR2). We compute the median-likelihood estimates of these parameters using a large library of model spectra at medium-high resolution, covering a comprehensive range of star formation histories. The constraints we derive are set by the simultaneous fit of five spectral absorption features, which are well reproduced by our population synthesis models. By design, these constraints depend only weakly on the $\alpha$/Fe element abundance ratio. Our sample includes galaxies of all types spanning the full range in star formation activity, from dormant early-type to actively star-forming galaxies. By analysing a subsample of 44 254 high-quality spectra, we show that, in the mean, galaxies follow a sequence of increasing stellar metallicity, age and stellar mass at increasing 4000-{\AA} break strength. For galaxies of intermediate mass, stronger Balmer absorption at fixed 4000-{\AA} break strength is associated with higher metallicity and younger age. We investigate how stellar metallicity and age depend on total galaxy stellar mass. Low-mass galaxies are typically young and metal-poor, massive galaxies old and metal-rich, with a rapid transition between these regimes over the stellar mass range 3 × 109 ≲ M * ≲ 3 × 10 10M⊙. Both high- and low-concentration galaxies follow these relations, but there is a large dispersion in stellar metallicity at fixed stellar mass, especially for low-concentration galaxies of intermediate mass. Despite the large scatter, the relation between stellar metallicity and stellar mass is similar to the correlation between gas-phase oxygen abundance and stellar mass for star-forming galaxies. This is confirmed by the good correlation between stellar metallicity and gas-phase oxygen abundance for galaxies with both measures. The substantial range in stellar metallicity at fixed gas-phase oxygen abundance suggests that gas ejection and/or accretion are important factors in galactic chemical evolution. {\textcopyright} 2005 RAS.},

abstract = {Published B and V fluxes from nearby Type Ia supernovae are fitted to light-curve templates with 4-6 adjustable parameters. Separately, B magnitudes from the same sample are fitted to a linear dependence on B-V color within a post-maximum time window prescribed by the CMAGIC method. These fits yield two independent SN magnitude estimates B{\_}max and B{\_}BV. Their difference varies systematically with decline rate Delta m{\_}15 in a form that is compatible with a bilinear but not a linear dependence; a nonlinear form likely describes the decline-rate dependence of B{\_}max itself. A Hubble fit to the average of B{\_}max and B{\_}BV requires a systematic correction for observed B-V color that can be described by a linear coefficient R = 2.59 +- 0.24, well below the coefficient R{\_}B {\~{}} 4.1 commonly used to characterize the effects of Milky Way dust. At 99.9{\%} confidence the data reject a simple model in which no color correction is required for SNe that are clustered at the blue end of their observed color distribution. After systematic corrections are performed, B{\_}max and B{\_}BV exhibit mutual rms intrinsic variation equal to 0.074 +- 0.019 mag, of which at least an equal share likely belongs to B{\_}BV. SN magnitudes measured using maximum-luminosity or CMAGIC methods show comparable rms deviations of order {\~{}} 0.14 mag from the Hubble line.

abstract = {{The conditions that a planet must fulfill to be habitable are not precisely known. However, it is comparatively easier to define conditions under which a planet is very likely not habitable. Finding such conditions is important as it can help select, in an ensemble of potentially observable planets, which ones should be observed in greater detail for characterization studies. Assuming, as in the Earth, that the presence of a C-cycle is a necessary condition for long-term habitability, we derive, as a function of the planetary mass, a radius above which a planet is likely not habitable. We compute the maximum radius a planet can have to fulfill two constraints: surface conditions compatible with the existence of liquid water, and no ice layer at the bottom of a putative global ocean. We demonstrate that, above a given radius, these two constraints cannot be met. We compute internal structure models of planets, using a five-layer model (core, inner mantle, outer mantle, ocean, and atmosphere), for different masses and composition of the planets (in particular, the Fe/Si ratio of the planet). Our results show that for planets in the Super-Earth mass range (1-12 Mearth), the maximum that a planet, with a composition similar to that of the Earth, can have varies between 1.7 and 2.2 Rearth. This radius is reduced when considering planets with higher Fe/Si ratios and taking radiation into account when computing the gas envelope structure. These results can be used to infer, from radius and mass determinations using high-precision transit observations like those that will soon be performed by the CHaracterizing ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS), which planets are very likely not habitable, and therefore which ones should be considered as best targets for further habitability studies.{\}}},

abstract = {Observations show a prevalence of high redshift galaxies with large stellar masses and predominantly passive stellar populations. A variety of processes have been suggested that could reduce the star formation in such galaxies to observed levels, including quasar mode feedback, virial shock heating, or galactic winds driven by stellar feedback. However, the main quenching mechanisms have yet to be identified. Here we study the origin of star formation quenching using Argo, a cosmological, hydrodynamical zoom-in simulation that follows the evolution of a massive galaxy at {\$}z\backslashgeq{\{}{\}}2{\$}. This simulation adopts the same sub-grid recipes of the Eris simulations, which have been shown to form realistic disk galaxies, and, in one version, adopts also a mass and spatial resolution identical to Eris. The resulting galaxy has properties consistent with those of observed, massive (M{\_}* {\~{}} 1e11 M{\_}sun) galaxies at z{\~{}}2 and with abundance matching predictions. Our models do not include AGN feedback indicating that supermassive black holes likely play a subordinate role in determining masses and sizes of massive galaxies at high z. The specific star formation rate (sSFR) of the simulated galaxy matches the observed M{\_}* - sSFR relation at early times. This period of smooth stellar mass growth comes to a sudden halt at z=3.5 when the sSFR drops by almost an order of magnitude within a few hundred Myr. The suppression is initiated by a leveling off and a subsequent reduction of the cool gas accretion rate onto the galaxy, and not by feedback processes. This "cosmological starvation" occurs as the parent dark matter halo switches from a fast collapsing mode to a slow accretion mode. Additional mechanisms, such as perhaps radio mode feedback from an AGN, are needed to quench any residual star formation of the galaxy and to maintain a low sSFR until the present time.},

abstract = {We develop a 2D inclined rotating disc model, which we apply to the stellar velocity maps of 1862 galaxies taken from the MaNGA survey (SDSS public Data Release 15). We use a random forest classifier to identify the kinematic parameters that are most connected to galaxy quenching. We find that kinematic parameters that relate predominantly to the disc (such as the mean rotational velocity) and parameters that characterise whether a galaxy is rotation- or dispersion-dominated (such as the ratio of rotational velocity to velocity dispersion) are not fundamentally linked to the quenching of star formation. Instead, we find overwhelmingly that it is the absolute level of velocity dispersion (a property that relates primarily to a galaxy's bulge/spheroidal component) that is most important for separating star forming and quenched galaxies. Furthermore, a partial correlation analysis shows that many commonly discussed correlations between galaxy properties and quenching are spurious, and that the fundamental correlation is between quenching and velocity dispersion. In particular, we find that at fixed velocity dispersion, there is only a very weak dependence of quenching on the disc properties, whereby more discy galaxies are slightly more likely to be forming stars. By invoking the tight relationship between black hole mass and velocity dispersion, and noting that black hole mass traces the total energy released by AGN, we argue that these data support a scenario in which quenching occurs by preventive feedback from AGN. The kinematic measurements from this work are publicly available.},

We find that at all redshifts where we have large enough samples, {\$}h{\_}4{\$} anti-correlates with the ratio between rotation and dispersion, highlighting the physical connection between these two kinematic observables. In addition, and independently from the anti-correlation with rotation-to-dispersion ratio, we also find a correlation between {\$}h{\_}4{\$} and {\$}M{\_}\backslashstar{\$}, potentially connected to the assembly history of galaxies. In contrast, after controlling for mass, we find no evidence of independent correlation between {\$}h{\_}4{\$} and aperture velocity dispersion or galaxy size. These results hold for both star-forming and quiescent galaxies. For quiescent galaxies, {\$}h{\_}4{\$} also correlates with projected shape, even after controlling for the rotation-to-dispersion ratio. At any given redshift, star-forming galaxies have lower {\$}h{\_}4{\$} compared to quiescent galaxies, highlighting the link between kinematic structure and star-forming activity.},

With nine spectroscopic members, the proto-cluster was initially detected as a {\~{}}12 $\sigma$ spectroscopic overdensity of typical star-forming galaxies in the blind spectroscopic survey of the early universe (2 {\textless} z ≲ 6) performed by VUDS. It was further mapped using a new technique developed which statistically combines spectroscopic and photometric redshifts, the latter derived from a recent compilation of incredibly deep multi-band imaging performed on the COSMOS field. Through various methods, the descendant mass of PCl J1001+0220 is estimated to be log ( M h / M ⊙ ) z =0 {\~{}} 14.5–15 with a large amount of mass apparently already in place at z {\~{}} 4.57. An exhaustive comparison was made between the properties of various spectroscopic and photometric member samples and matched samples of galaxies inhabiting less dense environments at the same redshifts. Tentative evidence is found for a fractional excess of older galaxies more massive in their stellar content amongst the member samples relative to the coeval field, an observation which suggests the pervasive early onset of vigorous star formation for proto-cluster galaxies. No evidence is found for the differences in the star formation rates (SFRs) of member and coeval field galaxies either through estimating by means of the rest-frame ultraviolet or through separately stacking extremely deep Very Large Array 3 GHz imaging for both samples. Additionally, no evidence for pervasive strong active galactic nuclei (AGN) activity is observed in either environment. Analysis of Hubble Space Telescope images of both sets of galaxies as well as their immediate surroundings provides weak evidence for an elevated incidence of galaxy–galaxy interaction within the bounds of the proto-cluster. The stacked and individual spectral properties of the two samples are compared, with a definite suppression of Ly $\alpha$ seen in the average member galaxy relative to the coeval field ( f esc , Ly $\alpha$ = 1.8 −1.7 +0.3 {\%} and 4.0 −0.8 +1.0 {\%}, respectively). This observation along with other lines of evidence leads us to infer the possible presence of a large, cool, diffuse medium within the proto-cluster environment evocative of a nascent intracluster medium forming in the early universe.},

Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) for 14 z{\~{}}2 galaxies with existing CO(3-2) measurements, including 11 galaxies which contain active galactic nuclei (AGN) and three submillimeter galaxies (SMGs). We combine this sample with an additional 15 z{\~{}}2 galaxies from the literature that have both CO(1-0) and CO(3-2) measurements in order to evaluate differences in CO excitation between SMGs and AGN host galaxies, measure the effects of CO excitation on the derived molecular gas properties of these populations, and to look for correlations between the molecular gas excitation and other physical parameters. With our expanded sample of CO(3-2)/CO(1-0) line ratio measurements, we do not find a statistically significant difference in the mean line ratio between SMGs and AGN host galaxies as found in the literature, instead finding r{\_}3,1=1.03+/-0.50 for AGN host galaxies and r{\_}3,1=0.78+/-0.27 for SMGs (or r{\_}3,1=0.90+/-0.40 for both populations combined). We also do not measure a statistically significant difference between the distributions of the line ratios for these populations at the p=0.05 level, although this result is less robust. We find no excitation dependence on the index or offset of the integrated Schmidt-Kennicutt relation for the two CO lines, and obtain indices consistent with N=1 for the various sub-populations. However, including low-z "normal" galaxies increases our best-fit Schmidt-Kennicutt index to N{\~{}}1.2.

We discuss the possibilities that this object is a star-forming galaxy at the QSO redshift, z{\_}em=3.313 or a Seyfert galaxy. In the former case, we infer a star formation rate of 170 Msun/yr for this Kprime=21.3 object.

We discuss the implication of the emission line being a longer wavelength line at a lower redshift.},

Nebular C IV emission is present in the most extreme C III] emitters, requiring an ionizing source capable of producing a substantial component of photons with energies in excess of 47.9 eV. Photoionization models support a picture whereby the large equivalent widths are driven by the increased electron temperature and enhanced ionizing output arising from metal-poor gas and stars (0.04-0.13 Z{\&}sun;), young stellar populations (6-50 Myr), and large ionization parameters (log U = -2.16 to -1.84). The young ages implied by the emission lines and continuum spectral energy distributions (SEDs) indicate that the extreme line emitters in our sample are in the midst of a significant upturn in their star formation activity. The low stellar masses, blue UV colours, and large specific star formation rates of our sample are similar to those of typical z ≳ 6 galaxies.

abstract = {How and when did galaxies form and assemble their stars and stellar mass? The answer to these questions, so crucial to astrophysics and cosmology, requires the full reconstruction of the so called cosmic star formation rate density (SFRD), i.e. the evolution of the average star formation rate per unit volume of the universe. While the SFRD has been reliably traced back to 10-11 billion years ago, its evolution is still poorly constrained at earlier cosmic epochs, and its estimate is mainly based on galaxies luminous in the ultraviolet and with low obscuration by dust. This limited knowledge is largely due to the lack of an unbiased census of all types of star-forming galaxies in the early universe. We present a new approach to find dust-obscured star-forming galaxies based on their emission at radio wavelengths coupled with the lack of optical counterparts. Here, we present a sample of 197 galaxies selected with this method. These systems were missed by previous surveys at optical and near-infrared wavelengths, and 22 of them are at very high redshift (i.e. z {\textgreater} 4.5). The contribution of these elusive systems to the SFRD is substantial and can be as high as 40{\%} of the previously known SFRD based on UV-luminous galaxies. The mere existence of such heavily obscured galaxies in the first two billion years after the Big Bang opens new avenues to investigate the early phases of galaxy formation and evolution, and to understand the links between these systems and the massive galaxies which ceased their star formation at later cosmic times.},

abstract = {For a sample of 43 nearby, late-type galaxies, we have investigated the radial variation of both the current star formation rate and the dust-induced UV light attenuation. To do this we have cross-correlated IRAS images and GALEX observations for each of these galaxies, and compiled observations of the gas (CO and HI) and metal-abundance gradients found in the literature. We find that attenuation correlates with metallicity. We then use the UV profiles, corrected for attenuation, to study several variants of the Schmidt law and conclude that our results are compatible with a simple law similar to the one of Kennicutt but extending smoothly to lower surface densities, but with considerable scatter. We do not detect an abrupt break in the UV light at the threshold radius derived from H-alpha data (at which the H-alpha profile shows a break and beyond which only a few HII regions are usually found). We interpret the H-alpha sudden break not as a change in the star formation regime (as often suggested) but as the vanishingly small number of ionizing stars corresponding to low levels of star formation.},

abstract = {We compare the physical and morphological properties of z {\~{}} 2 Lyman-alpha emitting galaxies (LAEs) identified in the HETDEX Pilot Survey and narrow band studies with those of z {\~{}} 2 optical emission line galaxies (oELGs) identified via HST WFC3 infrared grism spectroscopy. Both sets of galaxies extend over the same range in stellar mass (7.5 {\textless} logM {\textless} 10.5), size (0.5 {\textless} R {\textless} 3.0 kpc), and star-formation rate ({\~{}}1 {\textless} SFR {\textless} 100). Remarkably, a comparison of the most commonly used physical and morphological parameters -- stellar mass, half-light radius, UV slope, star formation rate, ellipticity, nearest neighbor distance, star formation surface density, specific star formation rate, [O III] luminosity, and [O III] equivalent width -- reveals no statistically significant differences between the populations. This suggests that the processes and conditions which regulate the escape of Ly-alpha from a z {\~{}} 2 star-forming galaxy do not depend on these quantities. In particular, the lack of dependence on the UV slope suggests that Ly-alpha emission is not being significantly modulated by diffuse dust in the interstellar medium. We develop a simple model of Ly-alpha emission that connects LAEs to all high-redshift star forming galaxies where the escape of Ly-alpha depends on the sightline through the galaxy. Using this model, we find that mean solid angle for Ly-alpha escape is 2.4+/-0.8 steradians; this value is consistent with those calculated from other studies.},

We divided the LBDs into 3 redshift bins and, for each, stacked the B435, V606, and I814 images convolved to the same stellar point spread function (PSF). Their radii were determined from PSF deconvolution to be {\~{}}80 to {\~{}}180 pc. The high sSFR suggest that their entire stellar mass has formed in only 1{\%} of the local age of the universe. The sSFRs at similar epochs in local dwarf galaxies are lower by a factor of {\~{}}100. Assuming that the star formation rate is epsilon{\_}ff M{\_}gas/t{\_}ff for efficiency epsilon{\_}ff, gas mass M{\_}gas, and free fall time, t{\_}ff, the gas mass and gas-to-star mass ratio are determined. This ratio exceeds 1 for reasonable efficiencies, and is likely to be {\~{}}5 even with a high epsilon{\_}ff of 0.1. We consider whether these regions are forming today's globular clusters. With their observed stellar masses, the maximum likely cluster mass is {\~{}}10{\^{}}5 M{\_}sun, but if star formation continues at the current rate for {\~{}}10t{\_}ff{\~{}}50 Myr before feedback and gas exhaustion stop it, then the maximum cluster mass could become {\~{}}10{\^{}}6 M{\_}sun.},

abstract = {Aims. We investigate the stellar mass assembly history of ultramassive (M∗ 1011M) dense ($\Sigma$ = M∗/2$\pi$Re2{\textgreater} 2500M pc-2) early-type galaxies (ETGs, elliptical and spheroidal galaxies) selected on basis of visual classification over the last 9 Gyr. Methods. We traced the evolution of the comoving number density $\rho$ of ultramassive dense ETGs and compared their structural (effective radius Re and stellar mass M∗) and dynamical (velocity dispersion $\sigma$e) parameters over the redshift range 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.6. We derived the number density $\rho$ at 1.6 {\textless}z{\textless} 1 from the MUNICS and GOODS-South surveys, while we took advantage of the COSMOS spectroscopic survey to probe the intermediate redshift range [0.2-1.0]. We derived the number density of ultramassive dense local ETGs from the SDSS sample taking all of the selection bias affecting the spectroscopic sample into account. To compare the dynamical and structural parameters, we collected a sample of 11 ultramassive dense ETGs at 1.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.6 for which velocity dispersion measurements are available. For four of these ETGs (plus one at z = 1.91), we present previously unpublished estimates of velocity dispersion, based on optical VLT-FORS2 spectra. We probe the intermediate redshift range (0.2 ≤ z ≤ 0.9) and the local Universe with different ETGs samples. Results. We find that the comoving number density of ultramassive dense ETGs evolves with z as $\rho$(z) ∈ (1 + z)0.3 ± 0.8 implying a decrease of {\~{}}25{\%} of the population of ultramassive dense ETGs since z = 1.6. By comparing the structural and dynamical properties of high-z ultramassive dense ETGs over the range 0 ≤ z {\textless} 1.6 in the [Re, M∗, $\sigma$e] plane, we find that all of the ETGs of the high-z sample have counterparts with similar properties in the local Universe. This implies either that the majority ({\~{}}70{\%}) of ultramassive dense ETGs already completed the assembly and shaping at (z) = 1.4, or that, if a significant portion of dense ETGs evolves in size, new ultramassive dense ETGs must form at z {\textless} 1.5 to maintain their number density at almost constant. The difficulty in identify good progenitors for these new dense ETGs at z ≤ 1.5 and the stellar populations properties of local ultramassive dense ETGs point towards the first hypothesis. In this case, the ultramassive dense galaxies missing in the local Universe could have joined, in the last 9 Gyr, the so colled non-dense ETGs population through minor mergers, thus contributing to mean size growth. In any case, the comparison between their number density and the number density of the whole population of ultramassive ETGs relegates their contribution to the mean size evolution to a secondary process.},

abstract = {We compare mass-selected close pairs at z {\textless} 1 with the intrinsic galaxy merger rate in the Illustris Simulations. To do so, we construct three 140 arcmin2 lightcone catalogues and measure pair fractions, finding that they change little or decrease with increasing redshift at z {\textless} 1. Consistent with current surveys, this trend requires a decrease in the merger-pair observability time, roughly as t$\alpha$(1 + z)-2, in order to measure the merger rates of the same galaxies. This implies that major mergers are more common at high redshift than implied by the simplest arguments assuming a constant observability time. Several effects contribute to this trend: (1) The fraction of massive, major (4:1) pairs that merge by today increases weakly from {\~{}}0.5 at z = 1 to {\~{}}0.8 at z = 3. (2) The median time elapsed between an observed pair and final remnant decreases by a factor of 2 from z {\~{}} 1 to 3. (3) An increasing specific star formation rate decreases the time during which common stellar-mass-based pair selection criteria could identify the mergers. The average orbit of the pairs at observation time varies only weakly, suggesting that the dynamical time is not varying enough to account by itself for the pair fraction trends. Merging pairs reside in dense regions, having overdensity $\delta$ {\~{}} 10 to {\~{}}100 times greater than the average massive galaxy. We forward model the pairs to reconstruct the merger remnant production rate, showing that it is consistent with a rapid increase in galaxy merger rates at z {\textless} 1.},

We use these data to show that the typical dynamical-to-stellar mass ratio has increased by ∼0.2 dex from z = 2 to the present day, and investigate this evolution in the context of possible changes in the stellar initial mass function (IMF) and/or fraction of dark matter contained within the galaxy effective radius, fDM[{\textless} re]. Comparing our high-redshift sample to their likely descendants at low-redshift, we find that fDM[{\textless} re] has increased by a factor of more than 4 since z ≈ 1.8, from fDM[{\textless} re] = 6.6±1.0{\%} to ∼24{\%}. The observed increase appears robust to changes in the methods used to estimate dynamical masses or match progenitors and descendants. We quantify possible variation of the stellar IMF through the offset parameter $\alpha$, defined as the ratio of dynamical mass in stars to the stellar mass estimated using a Chabrier IMF. We demonstrate that the correlation between stellar velocity dispersion and $\alpha$ reported among quiescent galaxies at low-redshift is already in place at z = 2, and argue that subsequent evolution through (mostly minor) merging should act to preserve this relation while contributing significantly to galaxies overall growth in size and stellar mass.},

With these data, which cover 27.6 deg{\^{}}2, we can find significant numbers of very rare objects such as ultra-massive quiescent galaxies that populate the extreme massive end of the galaxy mass function, or dense environments that are likely to become present-day massive galaxy clusters. In this paper, the first in a series, we apply our gzK adaptation of the BzK technique to select our z{\~{}}1.6 galaxy catalog and then study the quiescent galaxy stellar mass function with good statistics over M{\_}stars {\~{}} 10{\^{}}10.2 - 10{\^{}}11.7 M{\_}sun --- a factor of 30 in mass --- including 60 ultra-massive z{\~{}}1.6 quiescent galaxies with M{\_}stars {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}11.5 M{\_}sun. We find that the stellar mass function of quiescent galaxies at z{\~{}}1.6 is well represented by the Schechter function over this large mass range. This suggests that the mass quenching mechanism observed at lower redshifts must have already been well established by this epoch, and that it is likely due to a single physical mechanism over a wide range of mass. This close adherence to the Schechter shape also suggests that neither merging nor gravitational lensing significantly affect the observed quenched population. Finally, comparing measurements of M* parameters for quiescent and star-forming populations (ours and from the literature), we find hints of an offset (M*{\_}SF {\textgreater} M*{\_}PE), that could suggest that the efficiency of the quenching process evolves with time.},

When stacked, the observed projected pairwise velocity dispersion of these satellites is sigma{\~{}}160 km/s, in agreement with abundance-matching expectations for their host halo masses. Finally, bright satellites around L* primaries are significantly redder than typical galaxies in their luminosity range, indicating that environmental quenching is operating within galaxy-size dark matter halos that typically contain only a single bright satellite. This redness trend is in stark contrast to the Milky Way's LMC, which is unusually blue even for a field galaxy. We suggest that the LMC's discrepant color might be further evidence that it is undergoing a triggered star-formation event upon first infall.},

Co-added spectra of galaxies with similar velocity dispersions, absolute r-band magnitudes and 4000-{\AA} break values are used for those regions of parameter space where individual spectra have lower S/N. We estimate the total density of metals $\rho$Z and of baryons $\rho$* in stars and, from these two quantities, we obtain a mass- and volume-averaged stellar metallicity of 〈Z*〉 = 1.04 ± 0.14 Z⊙, i.e. consistent with solar. We also study how metals are distributed in galaxies according to different properties, such as mass, morphology, mass- and light-weighted age, and we then compare these distributions with the corresponding distributions of stellar mass. We find that the bulk of metals locked up in stars in the local Universe reside in massive, bulge-dominated galaxies, with red colours and high 4000-{\AA} break values corresponding to old stellar populations. Bulge-dominated and disc-dominated galaxies contribute similar amounts to the total stellar mass density, but have different fractional contributions to the mass density of metals in stars, in agreement with the mass-metallicity relation. Bulge-dominated galaxies contain roughly 40 per cent of the total amount of metals in stars, while disc-dominated galaxies less than 25 per cent. Finally, at a given galaxy stellar mass, we define two characteristic ages as the median of the distributions of mass and metals as a function of age. These characteristic ages decrease progressively from high-mass to low-mass galaxies, consistent with the high formation epochs of stars in massive galaxies.

abstract = {JWST observations reveal a surprising excess of luminous galaxies at {\$}z\backslashsim 10{\$}, consistent with efficient conversion of the accreted gas into stars, unlike the suppression of star formation by feedback at later times. We show that the high densities and low metallicities at this epoch guarantee a high star-formation efficiency in the most massive dark-matter haloes. Feedback-free starbursts (FFBs) occur when the free-fall time is shorter than {\$}\backslashsim 1{\$} Myr, below the time for low-metallicity massive stars to develop winds and supernovae. This corresponds to a characteristic density of {\$}\backslashsim 3\backslashtimes 10{\^{}}3{\$}cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}. A comparable threshold density permits a starburst by allowing cooling to star-forming temperatures in a free-fall time. The galaxies within {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}} M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} haloes at {\$}z \backslashsim 10{\$} are expected to have FFB densities. The halo masses allow efficient gas supply by cold streams in a halo crossing time {\$}\backslashsim 80{\$} Myr. The FFBs gradually turn all the accreted gas into stars in clusters of {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}4-7.5{\}} M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} within galaxies that are rotating discs or shells. The starbursting clouds are shielded against feedback from earlier stars. We predict high star-formation efficiency above thresholds in redshift and halo mass, where the density is {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}3-4{\}}{\$}cm{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}. The {\$}z\backslashsim 10{\$} haloes of {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}10.8{\}} M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} are predicted to host galaxies of {\$}\backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}} M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} with SFR {\$}\backslashsim 65 M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} yr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} and sub-kpc sizes. The metallicity is {\$}\backslashleq 0.1 Z{\_}\backslashodot{\$} with little gas, dust, outflows and hot circumgalactic gas, allowing a top-heavy IMF but not requiring it. The post-FFB evolution of compact galaxies with thousands of young clusters may have implications on black-hole growth and globular clusters at later times.},

abstract = {We report ALMA observations of the most massive (star forming) galaxy in the redshift range 3{\textless}z{\textless}4 within the whole GOODS-S field. We detect a large elongated structure of molecular gas around the massive primeval galaxy, traced by the CO(4-3) emission, and extended over 40 kpc. We infer a mass of the large gaseous structure of Mgas{\~{}}2-6x10{\^{}}11 Msun. About 60{\%} of this mass is not directly associated with either the central galaxy or its two lower mass satellites. The CO extended structure is also detected in continuum thermal emission. The kinematics of the molecular gas shows the presence of different components, which cannot be ascribed to simple rotation. Furthermore, on even larger scales, we detect nine additional CO systems within a radius of 250 kpc from the massive galaxy and mostly distributed in the same direction as the CO elongated structure found in the central 40 kpc. The stacked images of these CO systems show detections in the thermal continuum and in the X-rays, suggesting that these systems are forming stars at a rate of 30-120 Msun/yr. We suggest that the extended gas structure, combined with its kinematic properties, and the gas rich star forming systems detected on larger scales, are tracing the inner and densest regions of large scale accreting streams, feeding the central massive galaxy. These results corroborate models of galaxy formation, in which accreting streams are clumpy and undergo some star formation (hence enriching the streams with metals) even before accreting onto the central galaxy.},

abstract = {We present the deepest far-IR observations obtained with Herschel and examine the 3-500um SEDs of galaxies at 0{\textless}z{\textless}2.5, supplemented by a local reference sample from IRAS, ISO, Spitzer and AKARI data. We find that the ratio of total IR luminosity to rest-frame 8um luminosity, IR8 (=Lir/L8), follows a Gaussian distribution centered on IR8=4 and defines an IR main sequence (MS). A minority population ({\textless}20 {\%}) of outliers producing a tail skewed toward higher values of IR8 consist of starbursts (SB) with compact projected star formation densities. IR8 can be used to separate galaxies with normal and extended modes of star formation from compact SBs with high-IR8, high projected IR surface brightness ({\textgreater}3x10{\^{}}10 Lsun kpc{\^{}}-2) and a high specific SFR (i.e., SBs). The rest-frame, UV-2700A size of these distant SBs is typically half that of MS galaxies, supporting the correlation between star formation density and SB activity that is measured for the local sample. Locally, (U)LIRGs are systematically in the SB mode, whereas most distant (U)LIRGs form stars in the "normal" MS mode. This confusion between two modes of star formation is the cause of the so-called "mid-IR excess" population of galaxies found at z{\textgreater}1.5 by previous studies. MS galaxies have strong PAH emission line features, a broad far-IR bump resulting from a combination of dust temperatures (Tdust{\~{}}15-50 K), and an effective Tdust{\~{}}31 K, as derived from the peak wavelength of their IR SED. Galaxies in the SB regime instead exhibit weak PAH EW and a sharper far-IR bump with an effective Tdust{\~{}}40 K. Finally, we present evidence that the mid-to-far IR emission of X-ray AGNs is predominantly produced by star formation and that candidate dusty AGNs with a power-law emission in the mid-IR systematically occur in compact, dusty SBs. After correcting for the effect of SBs on IR8, we identify new candidates for extremely obscured AGNs.},

abstract = {Over the last few years, both ALMA and Spitzer/IRAC observations have revealed a population of likely massive galaxies at {\$}z{\textgreater}3{\$} that was too faint to be detected in HST rest-frame ultraviolet imaging. However, due to the very limited photometry for individual galaxies, the true nature of these so-called HST-dark galaxies has remained elusive. Here, we present the first sample of such galaxies observed with very deep, high-resolution NIRCam imaging from the Early Release Science Program CEERS. 33 HST-dark sources are selected based on their red colours across 1.6 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m to 4.4 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m. Their physical properties are derived from 12-band multi-wavelength photometry, including ancillary HST imaging. We find that these galaxies are generally heavily dust-obscured ({\$}A{\_}{\{}V{\}}\backslashsim2{\$} mag), massive ({\$}\backslashlog (M/M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}) \backslashsim10{\$}), star-forming sources at {\$}z\backslashsim2-8{\$} with an observed surface density of {\$}\backslashsim0.8{\$} arcmin{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$}. This suggests that an important fraction of massive galaxies may have been missing from our cosmic census at {\$}z{\textgreater}3{\$} all the way into the reionization epoch.

We then investigate the correlation between LAE overdensity delta and Lya rest-frame equivalent width EW{\_}Lya{\^{}}rest, because the cosmological Lya RT model suggests that a slope of EW{\_}Lya{\^{}}rest-delta relation is steepened towards the epoch of cosmic reionization (EoR), due to the existence of the ionized bubbles around galaxy overdensities easing the escape of Lya emission from the partly neutral intergalactic medium (IGM). The available HSC data suggest that the slope of the EW{\_}Lya{\^{}}rest-delta correlation does not evolve from the post-reionization epoch z=5.7 to the EoR z=6.6 beyond the moderately large statistical errors.

abstract = {Star formation depends critically on cooling mechanisms in the interstellar medium (ISM); however, thermal properties of gas in galaxies at the peak epoch of star formation (z {\~{}} 2) remain poorly understood. A limiting factor in understanding the multiphase ISM is the lack of multiple tracers detected in the same galaxies, such as Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission, a tracer of a critical photoelectric heating mechanism in interstellar gas, and [C II] 158{\{}$\backslash$mu{\}}m fine-structure emission, a principal coolant. We present ALMA Band 9 observations targeting [C II] in six z {\~{}} 2 star-forming galaxies with strong Spitzer IRS detections of PAH emission. All six galaxies are detected in dust continuum and marginally resolved. We compare the properties of PAH and [C II] emission, and constrain their relationship as a function of total infrared luminosity (LIR) and IR surface density. [C II] emission is detected in one galaxy at high signal-to-noise (34{\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}}), and we place a secure upper limit on a second source. The rest of our sample are not detected in [C II] likely due to redshift uncertainties and narrow ALMA bandpass windows. Our results are consistent with the deficit in [C II]/LIR and PAH/LIR observed in the literature. However, the ratio of [C II] to PAH emission at z {\~{}} 2 is possibly much lower than what is observed in nearby dusty star-forming galaxies. This could be the result of enhanced cooling via [O I] at high-z, hotter gas and dust temperatures, and/or a reduction in the photoelectric efficiency, in which the coupling between interstellar radiation and gas heating is diminished.},

We find that at {\$}z\backslashsim1.5{\$}, the average metallicity of galaxies in overdensities with {\$}M{\_}*\backslashsim10{\^{}}{\{}9.8{\}}M{\_}\backslashodot, 10{\^{}}{\{}10.2{\}}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} and {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}10.8{\}}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} is higher relative to their field counterparts by {\$}0.094\backslashpm0.051{\$}, {\$}0.068\backslashpm0.028{\$} and {\$}0.052\backslashpm0.043{\$} dex, respectively. However, this metallicity enhancement does not exist at higher redshift, {\$}z\backslashsim2.3{\$}, where, compared to the field galaxies, we find {\$}0.056\backslashpm0.043{\$}, {\$}0.056\backslashpm0.028{\$} and {\$}0.096\backslashpm 0.034{\$} dex lower metallicity for galaxies in overdense environments with {\$}M{\_}*\backslashsim10{\^{}}{\{}9.8{\}}M{\_}\backslashodot, 10{\^{}}{\{}10.2{\}}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$} and {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}10.7{\}}M{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, respectively. Our results suggest that, at {\$}1.37\backslashleq z\backslashleq2.61{\$}, the variation of mass-metallicity relation with local environment is small ({\$}{\textless}0.1{\$}dex), and reverses at {\$}z\backslashsim2{\$}. Our results support the hypothesis that, at the early stages of cluster formation, owing to efficient gas cooling, galaxies residing in overdensities host a higher fraction of pristine gas with prominent primordial gas accretion, which lowers their gas-phase metallicity compared to their coeval field galaxies. However, as the Universe evolves to lower redshifts ({\$}z\backslashlesssim2{\$}), shock-heated gas in overdensities cannot cool down efficiently, and galaxies become metal-rich rapidly due to the suppression of pristine gas inflow and re-accretion of metal-enriched outflows in overdensities.},

abstract = {Measurements of H$\alpha$, H I, and CO distributions in 61 normal spiral galaxies are combined with published far-infrared and CO observations of 36 infrared-selected starburst galaxies, in order to study the form of the global star formation law over the full range of gas densities and star formation rates (SFRs) observed in galaxies. The disk-averaged SFRs and gas densities for the combined sample are well represented by a Schmidt law with index N = 1.4 +/- 0.15. The Schmidt law provides a surprisingly tight parametrization of the global star formation law, extending over several orders of magnitude in SFR and gas density. An alternative formulation of the star formation law, in which the SFR is presumed to scale with the ratio of the gas density to the average orbital timescale, also fits the data very well. Both descriptions provide potentially useful ``recipes'' for modeling the SFR in numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution.},

From our full-spectral-fitting analysis, we find that this galaxy formed its stellar population over a {\$}\backslashsimeq200{\$} Myr period, approximately {\$}600-800{\$} Myr after the Big Bang ({\$}z{\_}\backslashrm{\{}form{\}}=7.3\backslashpm0.2{\$}), before quenching at {\$}z{\_}\backslashrm{\{}quench{\}}=6.7\backslashpm0.3{\$}.

This galaxy also clearly demonstrates that the earliest onset of galaxy quenching was no later than {\$}\backslashsimeq800{\$} Myr after the Big Bang.

Although large-scale star formation in GS-9209 has been quenched for almost half a billion years, the significant integrated quantity of accretion implied by this large black-hole mass suggests AGN feedback plausibly played a significant role in quenching star formation in this galaxy. GS-9209 is also extremely compact, with an effective radius of just {\$}215\backslashpm20{\$} parsecs.

abstract = {Broadband photometry of galaxies measures an unresolved mix of complex stellar populations, gas, and dust. Interpreting these data is a challenge for models: many studies have shown that properties derived from modeling galaxy photometry are uncertain by a factor of two or more, and yet answering key questions in the field now requires higher accuracy than this. Here, we present a new model framework specifically designed for these complexities. Our model, Prospector-{\$}\backslashalpha{\$}, includes dust attenuation and re-radiation, a flexible attenuation curve, nebular emission, stellar metallicity, and a 6-component nonparametric star formation history. The flexibility and range of the parameter space, coupled with MCMC sampling within the Prospector inference framework, is designed to provide unbiased parameters and realistic error bars. We assess the accuracy of the model with aperture-matched optical spectroscopy, which was excluded from the fits. We compare spectral features predicted solely from fits to the broadband photometry to the observed spectral features. Our model predicts H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} luminosities with a scatter of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}0.16 dex and an offset of 0.08 dex across a wide range of morphological types and stellar masses. This agreement is remarkable, as the H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} luminosity is dependent on accurate star formation rates, dust attenuation, and stellar metallicities. The model also accurately predicts dust-sensitive Balmer decrements, spectroscopic stellar metallicities, PAH mass fractions, and the age- and metallicity-sensitive features Dn4000 and H{\$}\backslashdelta{\$}. Although the model passes all these tests, we caution that we have not yet assessed its performance at higher redshift or the accuracy of recovered stellar masses.},

abstract = {Mapping Mg II resonance emission scattered by galactic winds offers a means to determine the spatial extent and density of the warm outflow. Using Keck/LRIS spectroscopy, we have resolved scattered Mg II emission to the east of 32016857, a star-forming galaxy at z = 0.9392 with an outflow. The Mg II emission from this galaxy exhibits a P-Cygni profile, extends further than both the continuum and [O II] emission along the eastern side of the slit, and has a constant Doppler shift along the slit which does not follow the velocity gradient of the nebular [O II] emission. Using the Sobolev approximation, we derive the density of Mg+ ions at a radius of 12-18 kpc in the outflow. We model the ionization correction and find that much of the outflowing Mg is in Mg++. We estimate that the total mass flux could be as large as 330-500 M ⊙ yr-1, with the largest uncertainties coming from the depletion of Mg onto grains and the clumpiness of the warm outflow. We show that confining the warm clouds with a hot wind reduces the estimated mass flux of the warm outflow and indicates a mass-loading factor near unity in the warm phase alone. Based on the high blue luminosities that distinguish 32016857 and TKRS 4389, described by Rubin et al., from other galaxies with P-Cygni emission, we suggest that, as sensitivity to diffuse emission improves, scattering halos may prove to be a generic property of star-forming galaxies at intermediate redshifts.},

abstract = {Using stellar kinematics measurements, we investigate the growth of massive, quiescent galaxies from z ∼ 2 to today. We present X-Shooter spectra from the UV to NIR and dynamical mass measurements of five quiescent massive ({\textgreater}1011 M⊙) galaxies at z ∼ 2. This triples the sample of z {\textgreater} 1.5 galaxies with well-constrained ($\delta$$\sigma$ {\textless} 100 km s-1) velocity dispersion measurements. From spectral population synthesis modeling we find that these galaxies have stellar ages that range from 0.5 to 2 Gyr, with no signs of ongoing star formation. We measure velocity dispersions (290-450 km s-1) from stellar absorption lines and find that they are 1.6-2.1 times higher than those of galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey at the same mass. Sizes are measured using GALFIT from Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 H160 and UDS K-band images. The dynamical masses correspond well to the spectral energy distribution based stellar masses, with dynamical masses that are ∼15{\%} higher. We find that M*/Mdyn may decrease slightly with time, which could reflect the increase of the dark matter fraction within an increasing effective radius. We combine different stellar kinematic studies from the literature and examine the structural evolution from z ∼ 2 to z ∼ 0: we confirm that at fixed dynamical mass, the effective radius increases by a factor of ∼2.8, and the velocity dispersion decreases by a factor of ∼1.7. The mass density within one effective radius decreases by a factor of ∼20, while within a fixed physical radius (1 kpc) it decreases only mildly (factor of ∼2). When we allow for an evolving mass limit by selecting a population of galaxies at fixed number density, a stronger size growth with time is found (factor of ∼4), velocity dispersion decreases by a factor of ∼1.4, and interestingly, the mass density within 1 kpc is consistent with no evolution. This finding suggests that massive quiescent galaxies at z ∼ 2 grow inside out, consistent with the expectations from minor mergers. {\textcopyright} 2013. The American Astronomical Society.

abstract = {Knowing the amount of ionizing photons from young star-forming galaxies is of particular importance to understanding the reionization process. Here we report initial results of a Subaru/Suprime-Cam deep imaging observation of the SSA22 proto-cluster region at z = 3.09, using a special narrow-band filter to optimally trace ionizing radiation from galaxies at z {\~{}} 3. The unique wide field-of-view of Suprime-Cam enabled us to search for ionizing photons from 198 galaxies (73 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) and 125 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs)) with spectroscopically measured redshifts z sime 3.1. We detected ionizing radiation from 7 LBGs, as well as from 10 LAE candidates. Some of the detected galaxies show significant spatial offsets of ionizing radiation from nonionizing UV emission. For some LBGs the observed nonionizing UV to Lyman continuum flux density ratios are smaller than values expected from population synthesis models with a standard Salpeter initial mass function (IMF) with moderate dust attenuation (which is suggested from the observed UV slopes), even if we assume very transparent intergalactic medium along the sightlines of these objects. This implies an intrinsically bluer spectral energy distribution, e.g., that produced by a top-heavy IMF, for these LBGs. The observed flux density ratios of nonionizing UV to ionizing radiation of 7 detected LBGs range from 2.4 to 23.8 and the median is 6.6. The observed flux density ratios of the detected LAEs are even smaller than LBGs, if they are truly at z sime 3.1. We find that the median value of the flux density ratio for the detected LBGs suggests that their escape fractions are likely to be higher than 4{\%}, if the Lyman continuum escape is isotropic. The results imply that some of the LBGs in the proto-cluster at z {\~{}} 3 have escape fraction significantly higher than that of galaxies (in a general field) at z {\~{}} 1 studied previously. Some of the data presented in this paper were obtained from the Multimission Archive at the Space Telescope Science Institute (MAST).

We have obtained an Hubble Space Telescope WFC3 spectrum of this object and measured its redshift from the detection of a deep 4000 {\AA} break consistent with an old population and a high metallicity.

abstract = {We study galactic star-formation activity as a function of environment and stellar mass over 0.5{\textless}z{\textless}2.0 using the FourStar Galaxy Evolution (ZFOURGE) survey. We estimate the galaxy environment using a Bayesian-motivated measure of the distance to the third nearest neighbor for galaxies to the stellar mass completeness of our survey, {\$}\backslashlog(M/M{\_}\backslashodot){\textgreater}9 (9.5){\$} at z=1.3 (2.0). This method, when applied to a mock catalog with the photometric-redshift precision ({\$}\backslashsigma{\_}z / (1+z) \backslashlesssim 0.02{\$}), recovers galaxies in low- and high-density environments accurately. We quantify the environmental quenching efficiency, and show that at z{\textgreater} 0.5 it depends on galaxy stellar mass, demonstrating that the effects of quenching related to (stellar) mass and environment are not separable. In high-density environments, the mass and environmental quenching efficiencies are comparable for massive galaxies ({\$}\backslashlog (M/M{\_}\backslashodot)\backslashgtrsim{\$} 10.5) at all redshifts. For lower mass galaxies ({\$}\backslashlog (M/M){\_}\backslashodot) \backslashlesssim{\$} 10), the environmental quenching efficiency is very low at {\$}z\backslashgtrsim{\$} 1.5, but increases rapidly with decreasing redshift. Environmental quenching can account for nearly all quiescent lower mass galaxies ({\$}\backslashlog(M/M{\_}\backslashodot) \backslashsim{\$} 9-10), which appear primarily at {\$}z\backslashlesssim{\$} 1.0. The morphologies of lower mass quiescent galaxies are inconsistent with those expected of recently quenched star-forming galaxies. Some environmental process must transform the morphologies on similar timescales as the environmental quenching itself. The evolution of the environmental quenching favors models that combine gas starvation (as galaxies become satellites) with gas exhaustion through star-formation and outflows ("overconsumption"), and additional processes such as galaxy interactions, tidal stripping and disk fading to account for the morphological differences between the quiescent and star-forming galaxy populations.},

abstract = {It is well established that (1) star-forming galaxies follow a relation between their star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass (M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\$}), the "star-formation sequence", and (2) the SFRs of galaxies correlate with their structure, where star-forming galaxies are less concentrated than quiescent galaxies at fixed mass. Here, we consider whether the scatter and slope of the star-formation sequence is correlated with systematic variations in the Sersic indices, {\$}n{\$}, of galaxies across the SFR-M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\$} plane. We use a mass-complete sample of 23,848 galaxies at {\$}0.5{\textless}z{\textless}2.5{\$} selected from the 3D-HST photometric catalogs.

We find that the scatter of the star-formation sequence is related in part to galaxy structure; the scatter due to variations in {\$}n{\$} at fixed mass for star-forming galaxies ranges from 0.14{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.02 dex at {\$}z\backslashsim2{\$} to 0.30{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.04 dex at {\$}z{\textless}1{\$}. While the slope of the log(SFR)-log(M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\$}) relation is of order unity for disk-like galaxies, galaxies with {\$}n{\textgreater}2{\$} (implying more dominant bulges) have significantly lower SFR/M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\$} than the main ridgeline of the star-formation sequence. These results suggest that bulges in massive {\$}z\backslashsim2{\$} galaxies are actively building up, where the stars in the central concentration are relatively young. At {\$}z{\textless}1{\$}, the presence of older bulges within star-forming galaxies lowers global SFR/M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\$}, decreasing the slope and contributing significantly to the scatter of the star-formation sequence.},

abstract = {Quiescent galaxies at {\$}z \backslashgtrsim 2{\$} are compact and have weak or absent emission lines, making it difficult to spatially resolve their kinematics and stellar populations using ground-based spectroscopy. Gravitationally lensed examples provide a promising route forward, but such objects are very rare. We describe a search in the fields of 232 galaxy clusters that has uncovered five bright ({\$}H{\_}{\{}\backslashrm AB{\}} {\textless} 20{\$}) lensed galaxies with red near-infrared colors. These include MRG-M0138, the brightest lensed galaxy known in the near-infrared. Analysis of near-infrared spectra and multiband photometry confirms that all are quiescent galaxies at z=1.95-2.64 with stellar ages of 0.5-1.4 Gyr (corresponding to formation epochs {\$}z{\_}{\{}\backslashrm form{\}} \backslashsimeq 3-4{\$}) and stellar masses of {\$}10{\^{}}{\{}11.6-12.8{\}} \backslashmu{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}} M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, where {\$}\backslashmu{\$} is the magnification. In three cases we derive lens models and reconstruct the source structure; these galaxies are massive ({\$}M{\_}* \backslashgtrsim 10{\^{}}{\{}11.0{\}} M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}) and follow the mass--size relation defined by unlensed samples. In two of these three galaxies, the main structural component is an inclined disk. Weak emission lines are detected in four of five galaxies with high ratios [NII]/H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$}{\~{}}2-6 that are inconsistent with a star formation origin. Based on the line ratios, the H{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} equivalent widths, and the distribution and kinematics of the gas, we infer that shocks are likely present in at least two galaxies and could be present in all of the line emitters. We speculate that these could be analogs of local galaxies in which AGN jet-driven outflows are thought to heat the interstellar medium and suppress star formation. In further papers we will present spatially resolved measurements of the stellar populations and kinematics of this unique sample.},

Spectra covering 3650 {\textless} $\lambda$ {\textless} 9350 {\AA} are obtained with VIMOS on the ESO-VLT with integration times of 14h. Here we present the survey strategy, target selection, data processing, and the redshift measurement process with an emphasis on the specific methods used to adapt to this high-redshift range. We discuss the spectra quality and redshift reliability and derive a success rate in redshift measurement of 91{\%}, or 74{\%} by limiting the dataset to the most reliable measurements, down to a limiting magnitude iAB = 25. Measurements are performed all the way down to iAB = 27. The mean redshift of the main sample is z {\~{}} 3 and extends over a broad redshift range mainly in 2 {\textless} z {\textless} 6. At 3 {\textless} z {\textless} 5, the galaxies cover a wide range of luminosities-23 {\textless} MNUV {\textless}-20.5, stellar mass 109M⊙ {\textless} M- {\textless} 1011M, and star formation rates 1Myr {\textless} SFR {\textless} 103M⊙/yr. We discuss the spectral properties of galaxies using individual as well asstacked spectra. The comparison between spectroscopic and photometric redshifts as well as colour selection demonstrate the effectiveness of our selection scheme. From about {\~{}} 90{\%} of the data analysed so far, we expect to assemble {\textgreater}6000 galaxies with reliable spectroscopic redshifts in 2 {\textless} z {\textless} 6 when complete. This makes the VUDS the largest survey at these redshifts and offers the opportunity for unprecedented studies of the star-forming galaxy population and its distribution in large-scale structures during the main phase of galaxy assembly.},

The Balmer decrements are derived from spatially resolved maps of Halpha and Hbeta emission from the 3D-HST survey. We find that with increasing stellar mass (M) both the normalization and strength of the gradient in dust attenuation increases. Galaxies with a mean mass of {\textless}log(M){\textgreater} = 9.2Msun have little dust attenuation at all radii, whereas galaxies with {\textless}log(M){\textgreater}= 10.2Msun have dust attenuation toward Halpha A(Halpha){\~{}}2mag in their central regions.

When applied to our data, we find that the star formation rates in the central r{\textless}1kpc of galaxies in the highest mass bin are {\~{}} 6 Msun/yr, six times higher than before correction and approximately half of the total star formation rate of these galaxies.

Jupiter's reflected light spectrum in the near-infrared is dominated by its methane opacity including a deep band at 2.3. $\mu$m. After the impact, sunlight that would have normally been absorbed by the large amount of methane in Jupiter's atmosphere was instead reflected by the cometary material from the impacts.

We first compare the nebular attenuation from Pa $\beta$ /H $\alpha$ with the stellar attenuation inferred from the spectral energy distribution, finding that the galaxies in our sample are consistent with an average ratio of the continuum attenuation to the nebular gas of 0.44, but with a large amount of excess scatter beyond the observational uncertainties. Much of this scatter is linked to a large variation between the nebular dust attenuation as measured by (space-based) Pa $\beta$ to (ground-based) H $\alpha$ to that from (ground-based) H $\alpha$ /H $\beta$ . This implies there are important differences between attenuation measured from grism-based/wide-aperture Pa $\beta$ fluxes and the ground-based/slit-measured Balmer decrement. We next compare star formation rates (SFRs) from Pa $\beta$ to those from dust-corrected UV. We perform a survival analysis to infer a census of Pa $\beta$ emission implied by both detections and nondetections. We find evidence that galaxies with lower stellar mass have more scatter in their ratio of Pa $\beta$ to attenuation-corrected UV SFRs. When considering our Pa $\beta$ detection limits, this observation supports the idea that lower-mass galaxies experience “burstier” star formation histories. Together, these results show that Pa $\beta$ is a valuable tracer of a galaxy's SFR, probing different timescales of star formation and potentially revealing star formation that is otherwise missed by UV and optical tracers.},

abstract = {Using the TNG100 (100 Mpc){\^{}}3 simulation of the IllustrisTNG project, we demonstrate a strong connection between the onset of star formation quenching and the stellar size of galaxies. We do so by tracking the evolutionary history of extended and normal-size galaxies selected at z=2 with log(M{\_}star) = 10.2 - 11 and stellar-half-mass-radii above and within 1-sigma of the stellar size--stellar mass relation, respectively. We match the stellar mass and star formation rate distributions of the two populations. By z=1, only 36{\%} of the extended massive galaxies have quenched, in contrast to a quenched fraction of 69{\%} for the normal-size massive galaxies. We find that normal-size massive galaxies build up their central stellar mass without a significant increase in their stellar size between z=2-4, whereas the stellar size of the extended massive galaxies almost doubles in the same time. In IllustrisTNG, lower black hole masses and weaker kinetic-mode feedback appears to be responsible for the delayed quenching of star formation in the extended massive galaxies. We show that relatively gas-poor mergers may be responsible for the lower central stellar density and weaker supermassive black hole feedback in the extended massive galaxies.},

@article{Kriek2016,
abstract = {Unlike spiral galaxies such as the Milky Way, the majority of the stars in massive elliptical galaxies were formed in a short period early in the history of the Universe. The duration of this formation period can be measured using the ratio of magnesium to iron abundance ([Mg/Fe]), which reflects the relative enrichment by core-collapse and type Ia supernovae. For local galaxies, [Mg/Fe] probes the combined formation history of all stars currently in the galaxy, including younger and metal-poor stars that were added during late-time mergers. Therefore, to directly constrain the initial star-formation period, we must study galaxies at earlier epochs. The most distant galaxy for which [Mg/Fe] had previously been measured is at z{\~{}}1.4, with [Mg/Fe]=0.45(+0.05,-0.19). A slightly earlier epoch (z{\~{}}1.6) was probed by stacking the spectra of 24 massive quiescent galaxies, yielding an average [Mg/Fe] of 0.31+/-0.12. However, the relatively low S/N of the data and the use of index analysis techniques for both studies resulted in measurement errors that are too large to allow us to form strong conclusions. Deeper spectra at even earlier epochs in combination with analysis techniques based on full spectral fitting are required to precisely measure the abundance pattern shortly after the major star-forming phase (z{\textgreater}2). Here we report a measurement of [Mg/Fe] for a massive quiescent galaxy at z=2.1. With [Mg/Fe]=0.59+/-0.11, this galaxy is the most Mg-enhanced massive galaxy found so far, having twice the Mg enhancement of similar-mass galaxies today. The abundance pattern of the galaxy is consistent with enrichment exclusively by core-collapse supernovae and with a star-formation timescale of 0.1-0.5 Gyr - characteristics that are similar to population II stars in the Milky Way. With an average past SFR of 600-3000 Msol/yr, this galaxy was among the most vigorous star-forming galaxies in the Universe.},

This pilot project studies the star formation history and the physical properties of the molecular gas and dust content of the highest redshift galaxies identified through the benefits of gravitational magnification. We robustly detect dust continuum emission for the full sample and CO emission lines for three of the targets. We find that one source shows spectroscopic multiplicity and is a blend of three galaxies at different redshifts (z=2.040, 3.252 and 4.680), reminiscent of previous high-resolution imaging follow-up of unlensed submillimetre galaxies, but with a completely different search method, that confirm recent theoretical predictions of physically unassociated blended galaxies. Identifying the detected lines as 12CO (J{\_}up=2-5) we derive spectroscopic redshifts, molecular gas masses, and dust masses from the continuum emission. The mean H{\_}2 gas mass of the full sample is (2.0 +- 0.2) x 10{\^{}}11 M{\_}sun/$\backslash$mu, and the mean dust mass is (2.0+-0.2) x 10{\^{}}9 M{\_}sun/$\backslash$mu, where $\backslash$mu=2-5 is the expected lens amplification. Using these independent estimations we infer a gas-to-dust ratio of $\backslash$delta{\_}GDR=55-75, in agreement with other measurements of submillimetre galaxies. Our magnified high-luminosity galaxies fall on the same locus as other high-redshift submillimetre galaxies, extending the L'{\_}CO - L{\_}FIR correlation observed for local luminous and ultraluminous infrared galaxies to higher FIR and CO luminosities.},

abstract = {We present results on the variation of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) emission at 7.7 micron in galaxies spanning a wide range in metallicity at z{\~{}}2. For this analysis, we use rest-frame optical spectra of 476 galaxies at 1.37{\$}\backslashleq z\backslashleq{\$}2.61 from the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey to infer metallicities and ionization states. Spitzer/MIPS 24 micron observations are used to derive rest-frame 7.7 micron luminosities (L(7.7)) and far-IR data from Herschel/PACS 100 and 160 micron to measure total IR luminosities (L(IR)). We find significant trends between the ratio of L(7.7) to L(IR) (and to dust-corrected SFR) and both metallicity and [OIII]/[OII] (O{\$}{\_}{\{}32{\}}{\$}) emission-line ratio. The latter is an empirical proxy for the ionization parameter. These trends indicate a paucity of PAH molecules in low metallicity environments with harder and more intense radiation fields. Additionally, L(7.7)/L(IR) is significantly lower in the youngest quartile in our sample (ages of {\~{}} 400 Myr) compared to older galaxies, which may be a result of the delayed production of PAHs by AGB stars. The relative strength of L(7.7) to L(IR) is also lower by a factor of {\~{}}2 for galaxies with masses M{\$}{\_}*{\textless}10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}} M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, compared to the more massive ones.

Contrary to our initial hopes, the indices cannot break a degeneracy between burst age and burst strength in post-starburst objects, but they are successful mean-age indicators when used with sensitive metallicity indicators.

abstract = {This is the second paper in a series aimed at investigating the main sources of uncertainty in measuring the observable parameters in galaxies from their spectral energy distributions (SEDs). In the first paper we presented a detailed account of the photometric redshift measurements and an error analysis of this process. In this paper we perform a comprehensive study of the main sources of random and systematic error in stellar mass estimates for galaxies, and their relative contributions to the associated error budget. Since there is no prior knowledge of the stellar mass of galaxies (unlike their photometric redshifts), we use mock galaxy catalogs with simulated multi-waveband photometry and known redshift, stellar mass, age and extinction for individual galaxies. The multi-waveband photometry for the simulated galaxies were generated in 13 filters spanning from U-band to mid-infrared wavelengths. Given different parameters affecting stellar mass measurement (photometric signal-to-noise ratios (S/N), SED fitting errors and systematic effects), the inherent degeneracies and correlated errors, we formulated different simulated galaxy catalogs to quantify these effects individually. For comparison, we also generated catalogs based on observed photometric data of real galaxies in the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey-South field, spanning the same passbands. The simulated and observed catalogs were provided to a number of teams within the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey collaboration to estimate the stellar masses for individual galaxies. A total of 11 teams participated, with different combinations of stellar mass measurement codes/methods, population synthesis models, star formation histories, extinction and age. For each simulated galaxy, the differences between the input stellar masses, Minput, and those estimated by each team, Mest, is defined as $\Delta$ log (M) ≡ log (Mestimated) - log(Minput) and used to identify the most fundamental parameters affecting stellar mass estimate in galaxies, with the following results. (1) No significant bias in $\Delta$ log(M) was found among different codes, with all having comparable scatter ($\sigma$ ($\Delta$ log(M)) = 0.136 dex). The estimated stellar mass values are seriously affected by low photometric S/N, with the rms scatter increasing for galaxies with HAB {\textgreater} 26 mag; (2) A source of error contributing to the scatter in $\Delta$ log(M) is found to be due to photometric uncertainties (0.136 dex) and low resolution in age and extinction grids when generating the SED templates; (3) The median of stellar masses among different methods provides a stable measure of the mass associated with any given galaxy ($\sigma$ ($\Delta$ log(M)) = 0.142 dex); (4) The $\Delta$ log(M) values are strongly correlated with deviations in age (defined as the difference between the estimated and expected values), with a weaker correlation with extinction; (5) The rms scatter in the estimated stellar masses due to free parameters (after fixing redshifts and initial mass function) are quantified and found to be $\sigma$ ($\Delta$ log(M)) = 0.110 dex; (6) Using the observed data, we studied the sensitivity of stellar masses to both the population synthesis codes and inclusion of nebular emission lines and found them to affect the stellar mass by 0.2 and 0.3 dex respectively.},

This idea has not previously yielded scientific successes, probably because of the noise and incompleteness in chemical-abundance measurements. However, we have succeeded in substantially improving spectroscopic measurements with The Cannon, which has delivered 15 individual abundances for 100,000 stars observed as part of the APOGEE spectroscopic survey, with precisions around 0.04 dex. We test the chemical-tagging hypothesis by looking at clusters in abundance space and confirming that they are clustered in phase space. We identify (by the k-means algorithm) overdensities of stars in the 15-dimensional chemical-abundance space delivered by The Cannon, and plot the associated stars in phase space. We use only abundance-space information (no positional information) to identify stellar groups. We find that clusters in abundance space are indeed clusters in phase space. We recover some known phase-space clusters and find other interesting structures. This confirms the chemical-tagging hypothesis and verifies the precision of the abundance measurements delivered by The Cannon. This is the first-ever project to identify phase-space structures by blind search purely in abundance space; the prospects for future data sets are very good.},

abstract = {The cosmic noon (z{\~{}}1.5-3) marked a period of vigorous star formation for most galaxies. However, about a third of the more massive galaxies at those times were quiescent in the sense that their observed stellar populations are inconsistent with rapid star formation. The reduced star formation activity is often attributed to gaseous outflows driven by feedback from supermassive black holes, but the impact of black hole feedback on galaxies in the young Universe is not yet definitively established. We analyze the origin of quiescent galaxies with the help of ultra-high resolution, cosmological simulations that include feedback from stars but do not model the uncertain consequences of black hole feedback. We show that dark matter halos with specific accretion rates below {\~{}}0.25-0.4 per Gyr preferentially host galaxies with reduced star formation rates and red broad-band colors. The fraction of such halos in large dark matter only simulations matches the observed fraction of massive quiescent galaxies ({\~{}}10{\^{}}10-10{\^{}}11 Msun). This strongly suggests that halo accretion rate is the key parameter determining which massive galaxies at z{\~{}}1.5-3 become quiescent. Empirical models that connect galaxy and halo evolution, such as halo occupation distribution or abundance matching models, assume a tight link between galaxy properties and the masses of their parent halos. These models will benefit from adding the specific accretion rate of halos as a second model parameter.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of RG1M0150, a massive, recently quenched galaxy at z = 2.636 that is multiply imaged by the cluster MACSJ0150.3-1005. We derive a stellar mass of log M∗ = 11.49-0.16+0.10 and a half-light radius of Ee,maj = 1.8 ± 0.4 kpc. Taking advantage of the lensing magnification, we are able to spatially resolve a remarkably massive yet compact quiescent galaxy at z{\textgreater}2 in ground-based near-infrared spectroscopic observations using Magellan/FIRE and Keck/MOSFIRE. We find no gradient in the strength of the Balmer absorption lines over 0.6Re-1.6Re which are consistent with an age of 760 Myr. Gas emission in [N ii] broadly traces the spatial distribution of the stars and is coupled with weak H$\alpha$ emission (log [N ii]/H$\alpha$ = 0.6±0.2), indicating that OB stars are not the primary ionizing source. The velocity dispersion within the effective radius is $\sigma$e,stars = 271 ± 41 km s-1 We detect rotation in the stellar absorption lines for the first time beyond z∼1. Using a two-integral Jeans model that accounts for observational effects, we measure a dynamical mass of log Mdyn = 11.24 0.14 and V/$\sigma$ = 0.70 ± 0.21. This is a high degree of rotation considering the modest observed ellipticity of 0.12 ± 0.08, but it is consistent with predictions from dissipational merger simulations that produce compact remnants. The mass of RG1M0150 implies that it is likely to become a slowly rotating elliptical. If it is typical, this suggests that the progenitors of massive ellipticals retain significant net angular momentum after quenching which later declines, perhaps through accretion of satellites.},

The long-wavelength filters of {\$}JWST{\$}'s NIRCam offer a significant step forward. For galaxies at Cosmic Noon ({\$}z\backslashsim2{\$}), this regime corresponds to the rest-frame near-infrared, which is less biased towards young stars and captures emission from the bulk of a galaxy's stellar population.

We interpret this to be the result of both a radially-decreasing gradient in attenuation and substantial spatial offsets between UV- and IR-emitting components.

We combine the full JADES imaging dataset with data from the JEMS and FRESCO JWST surveys along with extremely deep existing observations from HST/ACS for a final filter set that includes fifteen JWST/NIRCam filters and five HST/ACS filters. The high-redshift galaxy candidates were selected from their estimated photometric redshifts calculated using a template fitting approach, followed by visual inspection from seven independent reviewers. We explore these candidates in detail, highlighting interesting resolved or extended sources, sources with very red long-wavelength slopes, and our highest redshift candidates, which extend to {\$}z{\_}{\{}phot{\}} = 18{\$}. We also investigate potential contamination by stellar objects, and do not find strong evidence from SED fitting that these faint high-redshift galaxy candidates are low-mass stars. Over 93$\backslash${\%} of the sources are newly identified from our deep JADES imaging, including 31 new galaxy candidates at {\$}z{\_}{\{}phot{\}} {\textgreater} 12{\$}. Using 42 sources in our sample with measured spectroscopic redshifts from NIRSpec and FRESCO, we find excellent agreement to our photometric redshift estimates, with no catastrophic outliers and an average difference of {\$}\backslashlangle \backslashDelta z = z{\_}{\{}phot{\}}- z{\_}{\{}spec{\}} \backslashrangle= 0.26{\$}.

abstract = {We use a sample of 90 spectroscopically-confirmed Lyman Break Galaxies with H-alpha and 24 micron observations to constrain the relationship between rest-frame 8 micron luminosity, L(8), and star formation rate (SFR) for L* galaxies at z{\~{}}2. We find a tight correlation with 0.24 dex scatter between L8 and L(Ha)/SFR for z{\~{}}2 galaxies with L(IR){\~{}}10{\^{}}10 - 10{\^{}}12 Lsun. Employing this relationship with a larger sample of 392 galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts, we find that the UV slope can be used to recover the dust attenuation of the vast majority of L* galaxies at z{\~{}}2 to within 0.4 dex scatter using the local correlation. Separately, young galaxies with ages {\textless}100 Myr appear to follow an extinction curve that is steeper than the one found for local starburst galaxies. Therefore, such young galaxies may be significantly less dusty than inferred previously. Our results provide the first direct evidence, independent of the UV slope, for a correlation between UV and bolometric luminosity at high redshift, in the sense that UV-faint galaxies are also on average less infrared and less bolometrically-luminous than their UV-bright counterparts. Further, as the SFR increases, the UV luminosity reaches a maximum value corresponding to L* at z{\~{}}2, implying that dust obscuration may be largely responsible for modulating the bright-end of the UV luminosity function. L* galaxies at z{\~{}}2, while at least an order of magnitude more bolometrically-luminous, exhibit ratios of metals-to-dust that are similar to those of local starbursts. This result is expected if high-redshift galaxies are forming their stars in a less metal-rich environment compared to local galaxies of the same luminosity, thus naturally leading to a redshift evolution in both the luminosity-metallicity and luminosity-obscuration relations.

abstract = {Understanding the physical processes that drive star formation is a key challenge for galaxy formation models. In this article we study the tight correlation between the star formation rate (SFR) and stellar mass of galaxies at a given redshift, how halo growth influences star formation, and star formation histories of individual galaxies. We study these topics using Illustris, a state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical simulation of galaxy formation. Illustris reproduces the observed relation (the star formation main sequence; SFMS) between SFR and stellar mass at redshifts z=0 and z=4, but at intermediate redshifts of z{\~{}}2, the simulated SFMS has a significantly lower normalisation than reported by observations. The scatter in the relation is consistent with the observed scatter. However, the fraction of outliers above the SFR-stellar mass relation in Illustris is less than that observed. Galaxies with halo masses of {\~{}}10{\^{}}{\{}12{\}} solar masses dominate the SFR density of the Universe, in agreement with the results of abundance matching. Furthermore, more-massive galaxies tend to form the bulk of their stars at high redshift, which indicates that `downsizing' occurs in Illustris. We also studied the star formation histories of individual galaxies, including the use of a principal component analysis decomposition. We find that for fixed stellar mass, galaxies that form earlier have more-massive black holes at z=0, indicating that star formation and black hole growth are tightly linked processes in Illustris. While many of the properties of normal star-forming galaxies are well-reproduced in the Illustris simulation, forming a realistic population of starbursts will likely require higher resolution and probably a more sophisticated treatment of star formation and feedback from stars and black holes.},

We have identified authentically quiescent galaxies in the UV J diagram based on their D4000 strengths. This spectroscopic identification is in good agreement with their photometrically-derived specific star formation rates (sSFR). Morphologically, most (that is, 66 out of 68 galaxies, ∼ 97 {\%}) of these newly identified quiescent galaxies have a prominent bulge component. However, not all of the bulge-dominated galaxies are quenched. We found that bulge-dominated galaxies show positive correlations among the D4000 strength, stellar mass, and the S{\'{e}}rsic index, while late-type disks do not show such strong positive correlations. Also, bulge-dominated galaxies are clearly separated into two main groups in the parameter space of sSFR vs. stellar mass and stellar surface density within the effective radius, $\Sigma$ e , while late-type disks and irregulars only show high sSFR. This split is directly linked to the 'blue cloud' and the 'red sequence' populations, and correlates with the associated central compactness indicated by $\Sigma$ e. While star-forming massive late-type disks and irregulars (with D4000 {\textless} 1.5 and log(M * /M ⊙) 10.5) span a stellar mass range comparable to bulge-dominated galaxies, most have systematically lower $\Sigma$ e 10 9 M ⊙ kpc −2.

This thesis takes advantage of the recently commissioned MOSFIRE spectrograph on Keck, to conduct a survey (ZFIRE) of galaxies at {\$}1.5{\textless}z{\textless}2.5{\$} to measure accurate spectroscopic redshifts and basic galaxy properties derived from multiple emission lines. The majority of the thesis work involved survey planning, observing, data reduction, and catalogue preparation of the ZFIRE survey and is described in detail in this thesis. Using the ZFIRE spectroscopic redshifts, I show why spectroscopy is instrumental to determine fundamental galaxy properties via SED fitting techniques and to probe gravitationally bound structures in the early universe. The thesis further presents basic properties of the ZFIRE data products publicly released for the benefit of the astronomy community. The high mass-completeness of the ZFIRE spectroscopic data at {\$}z\backslashsim2{\$} makes it ideal to study fundamental galaxy properties such as, star formation rates, metallicities, inter-stellar medium properties, galaxy kinematics, and the stellar initial mass functions in unbiased star-forming galaxies.

abstract = {The selection of red, passive galaxies in the early Universe is very challenging, especially beyond z{\~{}}3, and it is crucial to constrain theoretical modelling of the processes responsible for their rapid assembly and abrupt shut-down of the star formation. We present here the analysis of ALMA archival observations of 26 out of the 30 galaxies in the deep CANDELS GOODS-South field that we identified as passive at z{\~{}}3-5 by means of a careful and conservative SED fitting analysis. ALMA data are used to verify the potential contamination from red, dusty but star--forming sources that could enter the sample due to similar optical--nearIR colours. With the exception of a few marginal detections at {\textless}3sigma, we could only infer upper limits, both on individual sources and on the stacks. We translated the ALMA continuum measurements into corresponding SFRs, using a variety of far-IR models. These SFRs are compared with those predicted by secondary star-forming solutions of the optical fits and with the expected position of the star formation Main Sequence. This analysis confirms the passive nature of 9 candidates with high confidence and suggests that the classification is correct for at least half of the sample in a statistical sense. For the remaining sources the analysis remain inconclusive because available ALMA data is not deep enough, although the stacking results corroborate their passive nature. Despite the uncertainties, this work provides decisive support to the existence of passive galaxies beyond z{\~{}}3.},

abstract = {We present multi-band Hubble Space Telescope imaging that spans rest-frame near-ultraviolet through near-infrared wavelengths (0.3-1.1 {\$}\backslashmu{\$}m) for 12 compact starburst galaxies at z=0.4-0.8. These massive galaxies (M{\_}stellar {\~{}} 10{\^{}}11 M{\_}Sun) are driving very fast outflows ({\$}v{\_}{\{}max{\}}{\$}=1000-3000 km/s), and their light profiles are dominated by an extremely compact starburst component (half-light radius {\~{}} 100 pc). Our goal is to constrain the physical mechanisms responsible for launching these fast outflows by measuring the physical conditions within the central kiloparsec. Based on our stellar population analysis, the central component typically contributes {\$}\backslashapprox{\$}25{\%} of the total stellar mass and the central escape velocities {\$}v{\_}{\{}esc,central{\}}\backslashapprox900{\$} km/s are a factor of two smaller than the observed outflow velocities. This requires physical mechanisms that can accelerate gas to speeds significantly beyond the central escape velocities, and it makes clear that these fast outflows are capable of traveling into the circumgalactic medium, and potentially beyond. We find central stellar densities comparable to theoretical estimates of the Eddington limit, and we estimate {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}1{\$} surface densities within the central kpc comparable to those of compact massive galaxies at {\$}0.5{\textless}z{\textless}3.0{\$}. Relative to "red nuggets" and "blue nuggets" at {\$}z\backslashsim2{\$}, we find significantly smaller {\$}r{\_}e{\$} values at a given stellar mass, which we attribute to the dominance of a young stellar component in our sample and the better physical resolution for rest-frame optical observations at {\$}z\backslashsim0.6{\$} versus {\$}z\backslashsim2{\$}. We compare to theoretical scenarios involving major mergers and violent disc instability, and we speculate that our galaxies are progenitors of power-law ellipticals in the local universe with prominent stellar cusps.},

abstract = {According to the current understanding of cosmic structure formation, the precursors of the most massive structures in the Universe began to form shortly after the Big Bang, in regions corresponding to the largest fluctuations in the cosmic density field. Observing these structures during their period of active growth and assembly - the first few hundred million years of the Universe - is challenging because it requires surveys that are sensitive enough to detect the distant galaxies that act as signposts for these structures and wide enough to capture the rarest objects. As a result, very few such objects have been detected so far. Here we report observations of a far-infrared-luminous object at redshift 6.900 (less than 800 Myr after the Big Bang) that was discovered in a wide-field survey. High-resolution imaging reveals this source to be a pair of extremely massive star-forming galaxies. The larger of these galaxies is forming stars at a rate of 2900 solar masses per year, contains 270 billion solar masses of gas and 2.5 billion solar masses of dust, and is more massive than any other known object at a redshift of more than 6. Its rapid star formation is probably triggered by its companion galaxy at a projected separation of just 8 kiloparsecs. This merging companion hosts 35 billion solar masses of stars and has a star-formation rate of 540 solar masses per year, but has an order of magnitude less gas and dust than its neighbor and physical conditions akin to those observed in lower-metallicity galaxies in the nearby Universe. These objects suggest the presence of a dark-matter halo with a mass of more than 400 billion solar masses, making it among the rarest dark-matter haloes that should exist in the Universe at this epoch.},

abstract = {We take advantage of the largest high-resolution simulation of cosmic structure growth ever carried out - the Millennium Simulation of the concordance $\Lambda$ cold dark matter (CDM) cosmogony - to study how the star formation histories, ages and metallicities of elliptical galaxies depend on environment and on stellar mass. We concentrate on a galaxy formation model which is tuned to fit the joint luminositycolourmorphology distribution of low-redshift galaxies. Massive ellipticals in this model have higher metal abundances, older luminosity-weighted ages and shorter star formation time-scales, but lower assembly redshifts, than less massive systems. Within clusters the typical masses, ages and metal abundances of ellipticals are predicted to decrease, on average, with increasing distance from the cluster centre. We also quantify the effective number of progenitors of ellipticals as a function of present stellar mass, finding typical numbers below two for , rising to approximately five for the most massive systems. These findings are consistent with recent observational results that suggest 'down-sizing' or 'antihierarchical' behaviour for the star formation history of the elliptical galaxy population, despite the fact that our model includes all the standard elements of hierarchical galaxy formation and is implemented on the standard, $\Lambda$CDM cosmogony. {\textcopyright} 2005 RAS.},

abstract = {Although the optical colour-magnitude diagram of galaxies allows one to select red sequence objects, neither can it be used for galaxy classification without additional observational data such as spectra or high-resolution images, nor to identify blue galaxies at unknown redshifts. We show that adding the near ultraviolet colour to the optical CMD reveals a tight relation in the three-dimensional colour-colour-magnitude space smoothly continuing from the "blue cloud" to the "red sequence". We found that 98 per cent of 225,000 low-redshift (Z{\textless}0.27) galaxies follow a smooth surface g-r=F(M,NUV-r) with a standard deviation of 0.03-0.07 mag making it the tightest known galaxy photometric relation. There is a strong correlation between morphological types and integrated NUV-r colours. Rare galaxy classes such as E+A or tidally stripped systems become outliers that occupy distinct regions in the 3D parameter space. Using stellar population models for galaxies with different SFHs, we show that (a) the (NUV-r, g-r) distribution is formed by objects having constant and exponentially declining SFR with different characteristic timescales; (b) colour evolution for exponentially declining models goes along the relation suggesting its weak evolution up-to a redshift of 0.9; (c) galaxies with truncated SFHs have very short transition phase offset from the relation thus explaining the rareness of E+A galaxies. This relation can be used as a powerful galaxy classification tool when morphology remains unresolved. Its mathematical consequence is the photometric redshift estimates from 3 broad-band photometric points. This approach works better than most existing photometric redshift techniques applied to multi-colour datasets. Therefore, the relation can be used as an efficient selection technique for galaxies at intermediate redshifts (0.3{\textless}Z{\textless}0.8) using optical imaging surveys.},

We derive the uncertainties on the stellar population synthesis properties using a Monte Carlo simulation and examine the correlations between the parameters with and without the use of the spectrum in the modeling of the spectral energy distributions. The spectroscopic constraints confirm the extreme stellar masses of the galaxies in our sample.

Our primary interest is to improve the constraints on the total IR luminosities, L(IR), of these galaxies. We combine the Spitzer data in the southern Extended Chandra Deep Field with a K-band-selected galaxy sample and photometric redshifts from the Multiwavelength Survey by Yale-Chile. We used a stacking analysis to measure the average 70 and 160 micron flux densities of 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5 galaxies as a function of 24 micron flux density, X-ray activity, and rest-frame near-IR color. Galaxies with 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5 and S(24)=53-250 micro-Jy have L(IR) derived from their average 24-160 micron flux densities within factors of 2-3 of those derived from the 24 micron flux densities only. However, L(IR) derived from the average 24-160 micron flux densities for galaxies with S(24) {\textgreater} 250 micro-Jy and 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5 are lower than those derived using only the 24 micron flux density by factors of 2-10. Galaxies with S(24) {\textgreater} 250 micro-Jy have S(70)/S(24) flux ratios comparable to sources with X-ray detections or red rest-frame IR colors, suggesting that warm dust possibly heated by AGN may contribute to the high 24 micron emission. Based on the average 24-160 micron flux densities, nearly all 24 micron-selected galaxies at 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5 have L(IR) {\textless} 6 x 10{\^{}}12 solar luminosities, which if attributed to star formation corresponds to {\textless} 1000 solar masses per year.

abstract = {Present-day clusters are massive halos containing mostly quiescent galaxies, while distant protoclusters are extended structures containing numerous star-forming galaxies. We investigate the implications of this fundamental change in a cosmological context using a set of N-body simulations and semi-analytic models. We find that the fraction of the cosmic volume occupied by all (proto)clusters increases by nearly three orders of magnitude from z=0 to z=7. We show that (proto)cluster galaxies are an important, and even dominant population at high redshift, as their expected contribution to the cosmic star-formation rate density rises (from 1{\%} at z=0) to 20{\%} at z=2 and 50{\%} at z=10. Protoclusters thus provide a significant fraction of the cosmic ionizing photons, and may have been crucial in driving the timing and topology of cosmic reionization. Internally, the average history of cluster formation can be described by three distinct phases: at z{\~{}}10-5, galaxy growth in protoclusters proceeded in an inside-out manner, with centrally dominant halos that are among the most active regions in the Universe; at z{\~{}}5-1.5, rapid star formation occurred within the entire 10-20 Mpc structures, forming most of their present-day stellar mass; at z{\textless}{\~{}}1.5, violent gravitational collapse drove these stellar contents into single cluster halos, largely erasing the details of cluster galaxy formation due to relaxation and virialization. Our results motivate observations of distant protoclusters in order to understand the rapid, extended stellar growth during Cosmic Noon, and their connection to reionization during Cosmic Dawn.},

abstract = {We examine the cosmic growth of the red sequence in a cosmological hydrodynamic simulation that includes a heuristic prescription for quenching star formation that yields a realistic passive galaxy population today. In this prescription, halos dominated by hot gas are continually heated to prevent their coronae from fueling new star formation. Hot coronae primarily form in halos above $\backslash$sim10{\^{}}12 M$\backslash$odot, so that galaxies with stellar masses $\backslash$sim10{\^{}}10.5 M$\backslash$odot are the first to be quenched and move onto the red sequence at z {\textgreater} 2. The red sequence is concurrently populated at low masses by satellite galaxies in large halos that are starved of new fuel, resulting in a dip in passive galaxy number densities around $\backslash$sim10{\^{}}10 M$\backslash$odot. Stellar mass growth continues for galaxies even after joining the red sequence, primarily through minor mergers with a typical mass ratio $\backslash$sim1:5. For the most massive systems, the size growth implied by the distribution of merger mass ratios is typically $\backslash$sim2$\backslash$times the corresponding mass growth, consistent with observations. This model reproduces mass-density and colour-density trends in the local universe, with essentially no evolution to z = 1, with the hint that such relations may be washed out by z $\backslash$sim 2. Simulated galaxies are increasingly likely to be red at high masses or high local overdensities. In our model, the presence of surrounding hot gas drives the trends with both mass and environment.},

Whilst SN 2010O remains undetected at radio frequencies, SN 2010P was detected (with an astrometric accuracy better than 1 milli arcsec in position) in its optically thin phase in epochs ranging from {\~{}}1 to {\~{}}3yr after its explosion date, indicating a very slow radio evolution and a strong interaction of the SN ejecta with the circumstellar medium. Our late-time radio observations toward SN 2010P probe the dense circumstellar envelope of this SN, and imply a mass-loss rate (Msun/yr) to wind velocity (in units of 10 km/s) ratio of (3.0-5.1)E-05, with a 5 GHz peak luminosity of {\~{}}1.2E+27 erg/s/Hz on day {\~{}}464 after explosion. This is consistent with a Type IIb classification for SN 2010P, making it the most distant and most slowly evolving Type IIb radio SN detected to date.},

abstract = {It is common practice to speak of a "green valley" that hosts galaxies whose colors are intermediate relative to those in the "blue cloud" and the "red sequence." In this study, we raise several questions about how galaxies might transition between the star-forming main sequence (SFMS) and varying "degrees of quiescence" from {\$}z=3{\$} to {\$}z\backslashsim0{\$}. We develop a physically and statistically motivated definition of "transition galaxies" based on their uniquely intermediate specific star formation rates, which relieves ambiguities associated with color-based selections and allows us to more cleanly compare observations to theoretical models. Our analysis is focused on galaxies with stellar mass {\$}M{\_}*{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, and is enabled by GAMA and CANDELS observations, a semi-analytic model (SAM) of galaxy formation, and a hydrodynamical simulation with state-of-the-art mechanical AGN feedback. In both the observations and the SAM, transition galaxies tend to have intermediate S$\backslash$'ersic indices, half-light radii, and surface stellar mass densities compared to star-forming and quiescent galaxies. We place an observational upper limit on the average population transition timescale as a function of redshift, finding that the average high-redshift galaxy is on a "fast track" for quenching ({\$}\backslashsim0.8{\$} Gyr at {\$}z\backslashsim2.5{\$}) whereas the average low-redshift galaxy is on a "slow track" for quenching ({\$}\backslashsim7{\$} Gyr at {\$}z\backslashsim0.5{\$}). We identify four dominant evolutionary modes for star formation histories in the SAM: oscillations on the SFMS, slow quenching, fast quenching, and rejuvenation. Quenching timescales in both the SAM and the hydrodynamical simulation are not fast enough to reproduce the heavily quiescent population that we observe at {\$}z\backslashsim3{\$}. In the SAM, we do not find a clear-cut morphological dependence of quenching timescales. [abridged]},

However, these lines, and more specifically the prominent C IV {\$}\backslashlambda 1549{\$} emission line, are typically blueshifted yielding highly uncertain redshift estimates compared to redshifts determined from rest-frame optical emission lines. We present near-infrared spectroscopy of 18 luminous quasars at {\$}2.15 {\textless} z {\textless} 3.70{\$} that allows us to obtain reliable systemic redshifts for these sources. Together with near-infrared spectroscopy of an archival sample of 44 quasars with comparable luminosities and redshifts, we provide prescriptions for correcting UV-based redshifts. Our prescriptions reduce velocity offsets with respect to the systemic redshifts by {\$}\backslashsim140{\$} km s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} and reduce the uncertainty on the UV-based redshift by {\$}\backslashsim25\backslash{\%}{\$} with respect to the best method currently used for determining such values. We also find that the redshifts determined from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Pipeline for our sources suffer from significant uncertainties, which cannot be easily mitigated. We discuss the potential of our prescriptions to improve UV-based redshift corrections given a much larger sample of high redshift quasars with near-infrared spectra.},

UVJ diagnostics reveal AGN tend to be hosted in a lower fraction of quiescent galaxies and a higher fraction of dusty galaxies than the control sample.

The remaining population, comprised predominantly of X-ray AGN hosts, is found mostly consistent with inactive galaxies, exhibiting only a marginal elevation. We discuss scenarios that may explain these findings and postulate that AGN are less likely to be a dominant mechanism for moderating galaxy growth via quenching than has previously been suggested.},

abstract = {[Abridged] We present a large, new set of stellar evolution models and isochrones for an alpha-enhanced metal distribution typical of Galactic halo and bulge stars; it represents a homogeneous extension of our stellar model library for a distribution already presented in Pietrinferni et al.(2004). The effect of the alpha-element enhancement has been properly taken into account in the nuclear network, opacity, equation of state and, for the first time, the bolometric corrections, and color transformations. This allows us to avoid the inconsistent use - common to all alpha-enhanced model libraries currently available - of scaled-solar bolometric corrections and color transformations for alpha-enhanced models and isochrones. We show how bolometric corrections to magnitudes obtained for the U,B portion of stellar spectra for T{\_}{\{}eff{\}}{\textless}=6500K, are significantly affected by the metal mixture, especially at the higher metallicities. We also provide complete sets of evolutionary models for low-mass, He-burning stellar structures covering the whole metallicity range, to enable synthetic horizontal branch simulations. We compare our database with several widely used stellar model libraries from different authors, as well as with various observed color magnitude and color-color diagrams (Johnson-Cousins BVI and near infrared magnitudes, Stromgren colors) of Galactic field stars and globular clusters. We also test our isochrones comparing integrated optical colors and Surface Brightness Fluctuation magnitudes with selected globular cluster data. We find a general satisfactory agreement with the empirical constraints.},

abstract = {We introduce the Hydrangea simulations, a suite of 24 cosmological hydrodynamic zoom-in simulations of massive galaxy clusters (M200c = 1014-1015.4M⊙) with baryon particle masses of{\~{}}106M⊙. Designed to study the impact of the cluster environment on galaxy formation, they are a key part of the 'Cluster-EAGLE' project. They use a galaxy formation model developed for the EAGLE project, which has been shown to yield both realistic field galaxies and hot gas fractions of galaxy groups consistent with observations. The total stellar mass content of the simulated clusters agrees with observations, but central cluster galaxies are too massive, by up to 0.6 dex. Passive satellite fractions are higher than in the field, and at stellar masses Mstar {\textgreater} 1010M⊙, this environmental effect is quantitatively consistent with observations. The predicted satellite stellar mass function matches data from local cluster surveys. Normalized to total mass, there are fewer low-mass (Mstar ≲ 1010M⊙) galaxies within the virial radius of clusters than in the field, primarily due to star formation quenching. Conversely, the simulations predict an overabundance of massive galaxies in clusters compared to the field that persists to their far outskirts ({\textgreater} 5 r200c). This is caused by a significantly increased stellar mass fraction of (sub-)haloes in the cluster environment, by up to {\~{}}0.3 dex even well beyond r200c. Haloes near clusters are also more concentrated than equally massive field haloes, but these two effects are largely uncorrelated.},

abstract = {Distant galaxies show correlations between their current star-formation rates (SFRs) and stellar masses, implying that their star-formation histories (SFHs) are highly similar. Moreover, observations show that the UV luminosities and stellar masses grow from z=8 to 3, implying that the SFRs increase with time. We compare the cosmologically averaged evolution in galaxies at 3 {\textless} z {\textless} 8 at constant comoving number density, n = 2 x 10{\^{}}-4 Mpc{\^{}}-3. This allows us to study the evolution of stellar mass and star formation in the galaxy predecessors and descendants in ways not possible using galaxies selected at constant stellar mass or SFR, quantities that evolve strongly in time. We show that the average SFH of these galaxies increase smoothly from z=8 to 3 as SFR {\~{}} t{\^{}}alpha with alpha = 1.7 +/- 0.2. This conflicts with assumptions that the SFR is either constant or declines exponentially in time. We show that the stellar mass growth in these galaxies is consistent with this derived SFH. This provides evidence that the slope of the high-mass end of the IMF is approximately Salpeter unless the duty cycle of star formation is much less than unity. We argue that these relations follow from gas accretion (either through accretion or delivered by mergers) coupled with galaxy disk growth under the assumption that the SFR depends on the local gas surface density. This predicts that gas fractions decrease from z=8 to 3 on average as f{\_}gas {\~{}} (1+z){\^{}}0.9 for galaxies with this number density. The implied galaxy gas accretion rates at z {\textgreater} 4 are as fast and may even exceed the SFR: this is the "gas accretion epoch". At z {\textless} 4 the SFR overtakes the implied gas accretion rate, indicating a period where galaxies consume gas faster than it is acquired. At z {\textless} 3, galaxies with this number density depart from these relations implying that star formation and gas accretion are slowed at later times.},

Our results highlight the heterogeneous nature of the most massive star-forming galaxies at high-redshift, and the importance of CO(1--0) observations to robustly constrain their total molecular gas content and ISM properties.},

abstract = {The excess numbers of blue galaxies at faint magnitudes is a subject of much controversy. Recent Hubble Space Telescope results has revealed a plethora of galaxies with peculiar morphologies tentatively identified as the evolving population. We report the results of optical spectroscopy and near-infrared photometry of a sample of faint $\backslash$HST galaxies from the Medium Deep Survey to ascertain the physical properties of the faint morphological populations. We find four principal results: Firstly that the population of objects classified as `peculiar' are intrinsically luminous in the optical ({\$}M{\_}B\backslashsim -19{\$}). Secondly these systems tend to be strong sources of [OII] line luminosity. Thirdly the optical-infrared colours of the faint population (a) confirm the presence of a population of compact blue galaxies and (b) show the stellar populations of Irregular/Peculiar galaxies encompass a wide range in age. Finally a surface-brightness comparison with the local galaxy sample of Frei et al shows that these objects are not of anomalously low surface brightness, rather we find that all morphological classes have evolved to a higher surface brightness at higher-redshifts ({\$}z{\textgreater}0.3{\$}).},

abstract = {We investigate the metallicity of the broad line region (BLR) of a sample of 30 quasars in the redshift range 4{\textless}z{\textless}6.4, by using near-IR and optical spectra. We focus on the ratio of the broad lines (SiIV1397+OIV]1402)/CIV1549, which is a good metallicity tracer of the BLR. We find that the metallicity of the BLR is very high even in QSOs at z{\~{}}6. The inferred metallicity of the BLR gas is so high (several times solar) that metal ejection or mixing with lower metallicity gas in the host galaxy is required to match the metallicities observed in local massive galaxies. On average, the observed metallicity changes neither among quasars in the observed redshift range 4{\textless}z{\textless}6.4, nor when compared with quasars at lower redshifts. We show that the apparent lack of metallicity evolution is a likely consequence of both the black hole-galaxy co-evolution and of selection effects. The data also suggest a lack of evolution in the carbon abundance, even among z{\textgreater}6 quasars. The latter result is puzzling, since the minimum enrichment timescale of carbon is about 1 Gyr, i.e. longer than the age of the universe at z{\~{}}6.},

abstract = {We investigate the intensity enhancement and the duration of starburst episodes triggered by major galaxy interactions and mergers. We analyze two large statistical datasets of numerical simulations. These have been obtained using two independent and different numerical techniques to model baryonic and dark matter evolution that are extensively compared for the first time. One is a Tree-SPH code, the other one is a grid-based N-body sticky-particles code. We show that, at low redshift, galaxy interactions and mergers in general trigger only moderate star formation enhancements. Strong starbursts where the star formation rate is increased by a factor greater than 5 are rare and found only in about 15{\%} of major galaxy interactions and mergers. Merger-driven starbursts are also rather short-lived, with a typical duration of activity of a few 108 yr. These conclusions are found to be robust, independent of the numerical techniques and star formation models. At higher redshifts where galaxies contain more gas, gas inflow-induced starbursts are neither stronger nor longer than their local counterparts. In turn, the formation of massive gas clumps, results of local Jeans instability that can occur spontaneously in gas-rich disks or be indirectly favored by galaxy interactions, could play a more important role in determining the duration and intensity of star formation episodes. {\textcopyright} 2008 ESO.},

The calibration between {\textless}IRX{\textgreater} and NRK allows us to recover the IR luminosity, L{\_}IR, with an accuracy of {\~{}}0.21 dex for the COSMOS sample and {\~{}}0.27 dex for the local one. The SFRs derived with this method agree with the ones based on the observed (UV+IR) luminosities and on the spectral energy distribution fitting for the vast majority ({\~{}}85 {\%}) of the star-forming population. Thanks to a library of model galaxy SEDs with realistic prescriptions for the star formation history, we show that we need to include a two-component dust model (i.e., birth clouds and diffuse ISM) and a full distribution of galaxy inclinations in order to reproduce the behavior of the {\textless}IRX{\textgreater} stripes in the NUVrK diagram. In conclusion, the NRK method, based only on rest-frame UV and optical colors available in most of the extragalactic fields, offers a simple alternative of assessing the SFR of star-forming galaxies in the absence of far-IR or spectral diagnostic observations.},

Its combined sensitivity and mapping speed at mid-infrared wavelengths revealed a substantial population of highly obscured AGNs. This population implies a higher radiative accretion efficiency, and thus possibly a higher spin, for black holes than indicated by surveys at optical or X-ray wavelengths. The unique mid-infrared spectrographic capability of Spitzer gave important insights into the distribution and nature of the dust surrounding AGNs, enabling the separation of AGN and starburst components, the detection of silicate features in emission from hot dust, and the identification of shocked gas associated with AGN activity. Spitzer's sensitivity allowed almost complete identification of the host galaxies of samples of AGNs selected in the X-ray and radio. As we look forward to the James Webb Space Telescope, the lessons learned from Spitzer studies will inform observational programmes with new and upcoming infrared facilities.},

abstract = {We present the relation between galaxy structure and spectral type, using a K-selected galaxy sample at 0.5{\textless}z{\textless}2.0. Based on similarities between the UV-to-NIR spectral energy distributions, we classify galaxies into 32 spectral types. The different types span a wide range in evolutionary phases, and thus -- in combination with available CANDELS/F160W imaging -- are ideal to study the structural evolution of galaxies. Effective radii (R{\_}e) and Sersic parameters (n) have been measured for 572 individual galaxies, and for each type, we determine R{\_}e at fixed stellar mass by correcting for the mass-size relation. We use the rest-frame U-V vs. V-J diagram to investigate evolutionary trends. When moving into the direction perpendicular to the star-forming sequence, in which we see the Halpha equivalent width and the specific star formation rate (sSFR) decrease, we find a decrease in R{\_}e and an increase in n. On the quiescent sequence we find an opposite trend, with older redder galaxies being larger. When splitting the sample into redshift bins, we find that young post-starburst galaxies are most prevalent at z{\textgreater}1.5 and significantly smaller than all other galaxy types at the same redshift. This result suggests that the suppression of star formation may be associated with significant structural evolution at z{\textgreater}1.5. At z{\textless}1, galaxy types with intermediate sSFRs (10{\^{}}{\{}-11.5{\}}-10{\^{}}{\{}-10.5{\}} yr{\^{}}-1) do not have post-starburst SED shapes. These galaxies have similar sizes as older quiescent galaxies, implying that they can passively evolve onto the quiescent sequence, without increasing the average size of the quiescent galaxy population.},

Five of these galaxies lie on the red sequence and show signatures of passive stellar populations in their rest-frame optical spectra. By fitting broadened spectral templates we have determined stellar velocity dispersions and, with broad-band Hubble Space Telescope and Spitzer photometry and imaging, stellar masses and effective radii. Using this enlarged sample of galaxies, we confirm earlier suggestions that quiescent galaxies at z {\textgreater} 2 have small sizes and large velocity dispersions compared to local galaxies of similar stellar mass. The dynamical masses are in very good agreement with stellar masses (log M */M dyn = -0.02 ± 0.03), although the average stellar-to-dynamical mass ratio is larger than that found at lower redshift (-0.23 ± 0.05). By assuming evolution at fixed velocity dispersion, not only do we confirm a surprisingly rapid rate of size growth but we also consider the necessary evolutionary track on the mass-size plane and find a slope $\alpha$ = dlog Re /dlog M * ≳ 2 inconsistent with most numerical simulations of minor mergers. Both results suggest an additional mechanism may be required to explain the size growth of early galaxies. {\textcopyright} 2014. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved..},

There is a strong correlation between the ratio of far-infrared to optical luminosities L(FIR)/L(H$\alpha$) and the extinction E(B-V) measured with the Balmer decrement. Before reddening correction, the SFR(IR) and SFR(H$\alpha$) are related to each other by a power law: SFR(IR)=(2.7+/-0.3)SFR(H$\alpha$)1.30+/-0.06. Correction of the SFR(H$\alpha$) for extinction using the Balmer decrement and a classical reddening curve both reduces the scatter in the SFR(IR)-SFR(H$\alpha$) correlation and results in a much closer agreement between the two SFR indicators; SFR(IR)=(0.91+/-0.04)SFR(H$\alpha$corr)1.07+/-0.03.

Using the deep extra-galactic legacy data of Hubble Space Telescope and the LAE catalogs taken from the literature, we derive the structural quantities of the 9119 LAEs and the comparison galaxies of 165517 photo-z star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and 10454 Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) by the well-tested profile fitting. We carefully define the homogeneous sample of LAEs falling in the same ranges of UV-continuum luminosity and Lya equivalent width over the cosmic time, and evaluate the redshift evolution. We find that the effective radius r{\_}e distribution is represented by a log-normal function, and that the median Sersic index is almost constant at n{\~{}}1-1.5 for the LAEs over z{\~{}}0-7, suggesting that typical LAEs have a stellar-disk morphology. The size-luminosity relation of the LAEs monotonically decreases towards high-z, following the size-luminosity relations of SFGs and LBGs. The median r{\_}e values of the LAEs significantly evolve as r{\_}e {\~{}} (1+z){\^{}}-1.37, similar to those of the SFGs and LBGs in the same luminosity range, in contrast with the claims of no evolution made by previous studies whose LAE samples are probably biased to faint sources at low redshift. Interestingly, the r{\_}e distribution, the star-formation rate surface densities, and the stellar-to-halo size ratios of the LAEs are comparable with those of the SFGs and LBGs, indicating that LAEs have stellar components similar to SFGs and LBGs with a Lya emissivity controlled by the non-stellar physics such as geometry, kinematics, and ionization states of the inter-stellar/circum-galactic medium.},

A radio signal is detected in the stacked 3 GHz image of CII-detected-all 31 and-lz samples at 3$\sigma$. We find that the infrared-radio correlation of our sample, quantified by 32 the infrared-to-1.4 GHz radio luminosity ratio (q TIR) is lower than the local q TIR relation for normal 33 SFGs at 2$\sigma$ significant level, and is instead broadly consistent with that of bright sub-mm galaxies 34 (SMGs) at 2 {\textless} z {\textless} 5.

Although we cannot rule out the possible effect of 38 the assumed spectral index and the applied infrared (IR) SED templates, the lower obscured fraction 39 of star formation than at lower redshift can alleviate the tension between our stacked q TIR s and that 40 of local normal SFGs. It is possible that the dust buildup, which primarily governs the IR emission in 41 addition to older stellar populations, has not had enough time to occur fully in these galaxies, whereas 42 the radio emission can respond on a more rapid scale. Therefore, we might expect a lower q TIR value 43 to be a general property of high-redshift SFGs. 2 Shen et al.},

ZFOURGE provides well-constrained photometric redshifts made possible through deep medium-bandwidth imaging at 1-2um . We combine this with HST imaging from the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS), allowing for the efficient selection of both blue and red galaxies down to stellar masses {\~{}}10{\^{}}9.5 Msol at z {\~{}} 2.5. The total surveyed area is 316 arcmin{\^{}}2 distributed over three independent fields. We supplement these data with the wider and shallower NEWFIRM Medium-Band Survey (NMBS) to provide stronger constraints at high masses. Several studies at z{\textless}=1 have revealed a steepening of the slope at the low-mass end of the stellar mass function (SMF), leading to an upturn at masses {\textless}10{\^{}}10 Msol that is not well-described by a standard single-Schechter function. We find evidence that this feature extends to at least z {\~{}} 2, and that it can be found in both the star-forming and quiescent populations individually. The characteristic mass (M*) and slope at the lowest masses (alpha) of a double-Schechter function fit to the SMF stay roughly constant at Log(M/Msol) {\~{}} 10.65 and {\~{}}-1.5 respectively. The SMF of star-forming galaxies has evolved primarily in normalization, while the change in shape is relatively minor. This is not the case for quiescent galaxies: the depth of our imaging allows us to show for the first time significantly more evolution at Log(M/Msol) {\textless} 10.5 than at higher masses. We find that the total mass density (down to 10{\^{}}9 Msol) in star-forming galaxies has increased by a factor of {\~{}}2.2 since z {\~{}} 2.5, whereas in quiescent galaxies it has increased by a factor of {\~{}}12 .},

abstract = {Quasars are rapidly accreting supermassive black holes at the centres of massive galaxies. They display a broad range of properties across all wavelengths, reflecting the diversity in the physical conditions of the regions close to the central engine. These properties, however, are not random, but form well-defined trends. The dominant trend is known as a 'Eigenvector 1', in which many properties correlate with the strength of optical iron and [O III] emission. The main physical driver of Eigenvector 1 has long been suspected to be the quasar luminosity normalized by the mass of the hole (the 'Eddington ratio'), which is an important parameter of the black hole accretion process. But a definitive proof has been missing. Here we report an analysis of archival data that reveals that the Eddington ratio indeed drives Eigenvector 1. We also find that orientation plays a significant role in determining the observed kinematics of the gas in the broad-line region, implying a flattened, disk-like geometry for the fast-moving clouds close to the black hole. Our results show that most of the diversity of quasar phenomenology can be unified using two simple quantities: Eddington ratio and orientation.},

abstract = {In clusters of galaxies, the red sequence is believed to be a consequence of a correlation between stellar mass and chemical abundances, with more massive galaxies being more metal-rich and, as a consequence, redder. However, there is a color scatter around the red sequence that holds even with precision photometry, implying that the galaxy population is more complicated than as described by a mass-metallicity relation. We use precision photometry from the Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) to investigate what drives this scatter. In four CLASH clusters at {\$}z=0.355 \backslashpm 0.007{\$}, we find that the optical-IR galaxy colors confirm the previously known trend of metallicity along the red sequence but also show a strong connection between stellar age and red sequence offset, with ages ranging from 3 to 8 Gyr. Starting with fixed-age color-magnitude relations motivated by the mass-metallicity correlations of CLASH cluster galaxies, and by adjusting galaxy colors through stellar population models to put them all at the age of our red sequence, we are able to reduce the, e.g., F625W {\$}-{\$} F814W scatter from 0.051 mag to 0.026 mag with median photometric errors of 0.029 mag. While we will extend this analysis to the full CLASH sample, in four clusters our technique already provides a color precision in near-total-light apertures to resolve the spread in stellar population formation ages that drives the scatter in the red sequence.},

The power afforded by strong gravitation lensing allows us to observe galaxies with higher angular resolution beyond current facilities. We select a stellar mass limited sample and divide them into star-forming or quiescent classes based on their rest-frame UVJ colors from the ASTRODEEP catalogs. Source reconstruction is carried out with the recently-released lenstruction software, which is built on the multi-purpose gravitational lensing software lenstronomy. We derive the empirical relation between size and mass for the late-type galaxies with M* {\textgreater} 3 × 109M⊙ at 1{\textless}z {\textless}2.5 and M* {\textgreater} 5 × 109M⊙ at 2.5{\textless}z {\textless}3, and at a fixed stellar mass, we find galaxy sizes evolve as {\$}R{\_}\backslashrm {\{}eff{\}} \backslashpropto (1+z){\^{}}{\{}-1.05\backslashpm 0.37{\}}{\$}. The intrinsic scatter is {\textless}0.1 dex at z {\textless} 1.5 but increases to ∼0.3 dex at higher redshift. The results are in good agreement with those obtained in blank fields. We evaluate the uncertainties associated with the choice of lens model by comparing size measurements using five different and publicly available models, finding the choice of lens model leads to a 3.7{\%} uncertainty of the median value, and ∼25 {\%} scatter for individual galaxies. Our work demonstrates the use of strong lensing magnification to boost resolution does not introduce significant uncertainties in this kind of work, and paves the way for wholesale applications of the sophisticated lens reconstruction technique to higher redshifts and larger samples.},

From the hundreds of square degrees mapped at submillimetre wavelengths, only a handful of sources have been confirmed to lie at z{\textgreater}5 and only two at z{\textgreater}6. All of these SMGs are rare examples of extreme starburst galaxies with star formation rates (SFRs) of {\textgreater}1000 M{\_}sun/yr and therefore are not representative of the general population of dusty star-forming galaxies. Consequently, our understanding of the nature of these sources, at the earliest epochs, is still incomplete. Here we report the spectroscopic identification of a gravitationally amplified (mu = 9.3 +/- 1.0) dusty star-forming galaxy at z=6.027. After correcting for gravitational lensing, we derive an intrinsic less-extreme SFR of 380 +/- 50 M{\_}sun/yr for this source and find that its gas and dust properties are similar to those measured for local Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxies (ULIRGs), extending the local trends to a poorly explored territory in the early Universe. The star-formation efficiency of this galaxy is similar to those measured in its local analogues, despite a {\~{}}12 Gyr difference in cosmic time.},

In this work, we carry out deep optical spectroscopic observations of four BluDOGs using Subaru/FOCAS and VLT/FORS2. The obtained spectra show broad emission lines with extremely large equivalent widths, and a blue wing in the CIV line profile. The redshifts are between 2.2 and 3.3.

The Cepheid distances are estimated from a recent calibration of the near-infrared Period-Luminosity P-L relation. The comparison is carried out in parallax space, where the DR1 parallax errors, with a median value of half the median parallax, are expected to be well-behaved. With the exception of one outlier, the DR1 parallaxes are in remarkably good global agreement with the predictions, and the published errors may be conservatively overestimated by about 20{\%}. The parallaxes of 9 Cepheids brighter than G = 6 may be systematically underestimated, trigonometric parallaxes measured with the HST FGS for three of these objects confirm this trend. If interpreted as an independent calibration of the Cepheid luminosities and assumed to be otherwise free of systematic uncertainties, DR1 parallaxes would imply a decrease of 0.3{\%} in the current estimate of the local Hubble constant, well within their statistical uncertainty, and corresponding to a value 2.5 sigma (3.5 sigma if the errors are scaled) higher than the value inferred from Planck CMB data used in conjunction with Lambda-CDM. We also test for a zeropoint error in Gaia parallaxes and find none to a precision of {\~{}}20 muas. We caution however that with this early release, the complete systematic properties of the measurements may not be fully understood at the statistical level of the Cepheid sample mean, a level an order of magnitude below the individual uncertainties. The early results from DR1 demonstrate again the enormous impact that the full mission will likely have on fundamental questions in astrophysics and cosmology.},

abstract = {Different theoretical methodologies lead to order-of-magnitude variations in predicted galaxy-galaxy merger rates. We examine how this arises and quantify the dominant uncertainties. Modeling of dark matter and galaxy inspiral/merger times contribute factor of ∼2 uncertainties. Different estimates of the halo-halo merger rate, the subhalo "destruction" rate, and the halo merger rate with some dynamical friction time delay for galaxy-galaxy mergers, agree to within this factor of ∼2, provided proper care is taken to define mergers consistently. There are some caveats: if halo/subhalo masses are not appropriately defined the major-merger rate can be dramatically suppressed, and in models with "orphan" galaxies and under-resolved subhalos the merger timescale can be severely overestimated. The dominant differences in galaxy-galaxy merger rates between models owe to the treatment of the baryonic physics. Cosmological hydrodynamic simulations without strong feedback and some older semianalytic models (SAMs), with known discrepancies in mass functions, can be biased by large factors (∼5) in predicted merger rates. However, provided that models yield a reasonable match to the total galaxy mass function, the differences in properties of central galaxies are sufficiently small to alone contribute small (factor of ∼1.5) additional systematics to merger rate predictions. But variations in the baryonic physics of satellite galaxies in models can also have a dramatic effect on merger rates. The well-known problem of satellite "over-quenching" in most current SAMs-whereby SAM satellite populations are too efficiently stripped of their gas-could lead to order-of-magnitude under-estimates of merger rates for low-mass, gas-rich galaxies. Models in which the masses of satellites are fixed by observations (or SAMs adjusted to resolve this "over-quenching") tend to predict higher merger rates, but with factor of ∼2 uncertainties stemming from the uncertainty in those observations. The choice of mass used to define "major" and "minor" mergers also matters: stellar-stellar major mergers can be more or less abundant than halo-halo major mergers by an order of magnitude. At low masses, most true major mergers (mass ratio defined in terms of their baryonic or dynamical mass) will appear to be minor mergers in their stellar mass ratio-observations and models using just stellar criteria could underestimate major-merger rates by factors of ∼3-5. We discuss the uncertainties in relating any merger rate to spheroid formation (in observations or theory): in order to achieve better than factor of ∼3 accuracy, it is necessary to account for the distribution of merger orbital parameters, gas fractions, and the full efficiency of merger-induced effects as a function of mass ratio. {\textcopyright} 2010.

abstract = {We present two-dimensional spectroscopy of the extremely metal-deficient blue compact dwarf (BCD) galaxy SBS 0335-052E aiming to studyphysical conditions, element abundances and kinematical properties of the ionised gas in this galaxy. Observations were obtained in the spectral range 3620-9400A with the imaging spectrograph GIRAFFE installed on the UT2 of the Very Large Telescope (VLT). These observations are the first ones carried out so far with GIRAFFE in the ARGUS mode which allows to obtain simultaneously 308 spectra covering a 11.4"x7.3" region. We produced images of SBS 0335-052E in the continuum and in emission lines of different stages of excitation. We find that while the maximum of emission in the majority of lines, including the strong lines Hbeta 4861A, Halpha 6563A, [OIII] 4363,5007A, [OII] 3726,3729A, coincides with the youngest south-eastern star clusters 1 and 2, the emission of HeII 4686A line is offset to the more evolved north-west clusters 4,5. This suggests that hard ionising radiation responsible for the HeII 4686A emission is not related to the most massive youngest stars, but rather is connected with fast radiative shocks. This conclusion is supported by the kinematical properties of the ionised gas from the different emission lines as the velocity dispersion in the HeII 4686A line is systematically higher, by {\~{}}50{\%}-100{\%}, than that in other lines. The variations of the emission line profiles suggest the presence of an ionised gas outflow in the direction perpendicular to the galaxy disk. (abridged)},

abstract = {We provide here the documentation of the new version of the spectral evolution model PEGASE. PEGASE computes synthetic spectra of galaxies in the UV to near-IR range from 0 to 20 Gyr, for a given stellar IMF and evolutionary scenario (star formation law, infall, galactic winds). The radiation emitted by stars from the main sequence to the pre-supernova or white dwarf stage is calculated, as well as the extinction by dust. A simple modeling of the nebular emission (continuum and lines) is also proposed. PEGASE may be used to model starbursts as well as old galaxies. The main improvements of PEGASE.2 relative to PEGASE.1 (Fioc {\&} Rocca-Volmerange 1997) are the following: (1)The stellar evolutionary tracks of the Padova group for metallicities between 0.0001 and 0.1 have been included; (2)The evolution of the metallicity of the interstellar medium (ISM) due to SNII, SNIa and AGB stars is followed. Stars are formed with the same metallicity as the ISM (instead of a solar metallicity in PEGASE.1), providing thus a metallicity-consistent model; (3)Lejeune et al.'s library of stellar spectra is used; (4)The extinction by dust is computed for geometries corresponding to disk and spheroidal galaxies using a radiative transfer code taking into account the scattering. The main outputs (as a function of time) are spectra, colors and magnitudes in various photometric systems, luminosities, type II and Ia supernovae rates, line intensities and equivalent widths, amount and metallicity of stars and gas, mass locked in stellar remnants, optical depth and total dust emission. The corresponding article (Fioc {\&} Rocca-Volmerange 2000) will be submitted soon. A detailed modeling of the spectrum of the dust emission and of HII regions (Moy, Rocca-Volmerange {\&} Fioc 2000) will be included in future versions.},

abstract = {We study the evolution of the core (r{\textless}1 kpc) and effective (r{\textless}r{\_}e) stellar-mass surface densities, in star-forming and quiescent galaxies. Since z=3, both populations occupy distinct, linear relations in log(Sigma{\_}e) and log(Sigma{\_}1) vs. log(M). These structural relations exhibit slopes and scatter that remain almost constant with time while their normalizations decline. For SFGs, the normalization declines by less than a factor of 2 from z=3, in both Sigma{\_}e and Sigma{\_}1. Such mild declines suggest that SFGs build dense cores by growing along these relations. We define this evolution as the structural main sequence (Sigma-MS). Quiescent galaxies follow different relations (Sigma{\^{}}Q{\_}e, Sigma{\^{}}Q{\_}1) off the Sigma-MS by having higher densities than SFGs of the same mass and redshift. The normalization of Sigma{\^{}}Q{\_}e declines by a factor of 10 since z=3, but only a factor of 2 in Sigma{\^{}}Q{\_}1. Thus, the common denominator for quiescent galaxies at all redshifts is the presence of a dense stellar core, and the formation of such cores in SFGs is the main requirement for quenching. Expressed in 2D as deviations off the SFR-MS and off Sigma{\^{}}Q{\_}1 at each redshift, the distribution of massive galaxies forms a universal, L-shaped sequence that relates two fundamental physical processes: compaction and quenching. Compaction is a process of substantial core-growth in SFGs relative to that in the Sigma-MS. This process increases the core-to-total mass and Sersic index, thereby, making compact SFGs. Quenching occurs once compact SFGs reach a maximum central density above Sigma{\^{}}Q{\_}1 {\textgreater} 9.5 M{\_}sun/kpc{\^{}}2. This threshold provides the most effective selection criterion to identify the star-forming progenitors of quiescent galaxies at all redshifts.},

Indeed, there are examples of young stellar populations also below the MS, indicating recent (bursty) star formation in evolved systems.

We also present the discovery of another (mini-)quenched galaxy at z = 4.4 (in addition to the one at z=7.3 reported by Looser et al. 2023), which might be only temporarily quiescent as a consequence of the extremely bursty evolution. Finally, we also find a steady decline of dust reddening of the stellar population approaching the earliest cosmic epochs, although some dust reddening is still observed in some of the highest redshift and most star forming systems.},

abstract = {In this paper, instead of invoking Dark Energy, we try and fit various cosmological observations with a large Gpc scale under-dense region (Void) which is modeled by a Lemaitre-Tolman-Bondi metric that at large distances becomes a homogeneous FLRW metric. We improve on previous analyses by allowing for nonzero overall curvature, accurately computing the distance to the last-scattering surface and the observed scale of the Baryon Acoustic peaks, and investigating important effects that could arise from having nontrivial Void density profiles. We mainly focus on the WMAP 7-yr data (TT and TE), Supernova data (SDSS SN), Hubble constant measurements (HST) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation data (SDSS and LRG). We find that the inclusion of a nonzero overall curvature drastically improves the goodness of fit of the Void model, bringing it very close to that of a homogeneous universe containing Dark Energy, while by varying the profile one can increase the value of the local Hubble parameter which has been a challenge for these models. We also try to gauge how well our model can fit the large-scale-structure data, but a comprehensive analysis will require the knowledge of perturbations on LTB metrics. The model is consistent with the CMB dipole if the observer is about 15 Mpc off the centre of the Void. Remarkably, such an off-center position may be able to account for the recent anomalous measurements of a large bulk flow from kSZ data. Finally we provide several analytical approximations in different regimes for the LTB metric, and a numerical module for CosmoMC, thus allowing for a MCMC exploration of the full parameter space.},

Allowing for the luminosity dependence tightens the diagnostic diagrams and the metallicity calibrations. The combined SDSS and high-redshift samples show that there is no redshift evolution in the line properties once the luminosity correction is applied, i.e., all galaxies with a given L(Hbeta) have similar strong emission-line distributions at all the observed redshifts.

abstract = {We present optical to far-infrared photometry of 31 reddened QSOs that show evidence for radiatively driven outflows originating from active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in their rest-frame UV spectra. We use these data to study the relationships between the AGN-driven outflows, and the AGN and starburst infrared luminosities. We find that FeLoBAL QSOs are invariably IR-luminous, with IR luminosities exceeding 1012 L ⊙ in all cases. The AGN supplies 76{\%} of the total IR emission, on average, but with a range from 20{\%} to 100{\%}. We find no evidence that the absolute luminosity of obscured star formation is affected by the AGN-driven outflows. Conversely, we find an anticorrelation between the strength of AGN-driven outflows, as measured from the range of outflow velocities over which absorption exceeds a minimal threshold, and the contribution from star formation to the total IR luminosity, with a much higher chance of seeing a starburst contribution in excess of 25{\%} in systems with weak outflows than in systems with strong outflows. Moreover, we find no convincing evidence that this effect is driven by the IR luminosity of the AGN. We conclude that radiatively driven outflows from AGNs can have a dramatic, negative impact on luminous star formation in their host galaxies. We find that such outflows act to curtail star formation such that star formation contributes less than ∼ 25{\%} of the total IR luminosity. We also propose that the degree to which termination of star formation takes place is not deducible from the IR luminosity of the AGN. {\textcopyright} 2012. The American Astronomical Society.

Understanding the origin of such star formation remains an open issue.

Utilizing high-resolution Hubble Space Telescope (HST) far-UV imaging provides unique insight into the distribution of UV light in these galaxies, which we call extended star-forming early-type galaxies (ESF-ETGs) because of extended UV emission that is indicative of recent star formation. The UV-optical color profiles of all ESF-ETGs show red centers and blue outer parts. Their outer colors require the existence of a significant underlying population of older stars in the UV-bright regions. An analysis of stacked SDSS spectra reveals weak LINER-like emission in their centers. Using a cross-matched SDSS DR7/GALEX GR6 catalog, we search for other green valley galaxies with similar properties to these ESF-ETGs and estimate that 13{\%} of dust-corrected green valley galaxies of similar stellar mass and UV-optical color are likely ESF-candidates, i.e., ESF-ETGs are not rare. Our results are consistent with star formation that is gradually declining in existing disks, i.e., the ESF-ETGs are evolving onto the red sequence for the first time, or with rejuvenated star formation due to accreted gas in older disks provided that the gas does not disrupt the structure of the galaxy and the resulting star formation is not too recent and bursty. ESF-ETGs may typify an important subpopulation of galaxies that can linger in the green valley for up to several Gyrs, based on their resemblance to nearby gas-rich green valley galaxies with low-level ongoing star formation.},

abstract = {We perform spatially-resolved, pixel-by-pixel SED fitting on galaxies up to {\$}z\backslashsim2.5{\$} in the Hubble Extreme Deep Field (XDF). Comparing stellar mass estimates from spatially resolved and spatially unresolved photometry we find that unresolved masses can be systematically underestimated by factors of up to 5. The ratio of the unresolved to resolved mass measurement depends on the galaxy's specific star formation rate (sSFR): at low sSFRs the bias is small, but above sSFR{\$}\backslash \backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}-9.5{\}}{\$} yr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} the discrepancy increases rapidly such that galaxies with sSFRs{\$}\backslash \backslashsim 10{\^{}}{\{}-8{\}}{\$} yr{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$} have unresolved mass estimates of only one half to one fifth of the resolved value. This result indicates that stellar masses estimated from spatially-unresolved datasets need to be systematically corrected, in some cases by large amounts, and we provide an analytic prescription for applying this correction. We show that correcting stellar mass measurements for this bias changes the normalization and slope of the star-forming main sequence and reduces its intrinsic width; most dramatically, correcting for the mass bias increases the stellar mass density of the Universe at high redshift and can resolve the long-standing discrepancy between the directly-measured cosmic star formation rate density at {\$}z\backslashgtrsim1{\$} and that inferred from stellar mass densities ("the missing mass problem").},

Kinematics and sizes are used to derive dynamical masses. Baryonic masses are estimated from stellar masses and inferred gas masses from dust-corrected star formation rates (SFRs) and the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation. We measure resolved rotation for 108 galaxies. For the remaining 600 galaxies we use models based on HST imaging structural parameters together with integrated velocity dispersions and baryonic masses to statistically constrain the median ratio of intrinsic ordered-to-disordered motion, {\$}V/\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}V,0{\}}{\$}. We find {\$}V/\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}V,0{\}}{\$} increases with increasing stellar mass and decreasing specific SFR (SSFR). These trends may reflect marginal disk stability, where systems with higher gas fractions have thicker disks. For galaxies with detected rotation we assess trends between their kinematics and mass, SSFR, and baryon surface density ({\$}\backslashSigma{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}bar{\}},e{\}}{\$}). Intrinsic dispersion correlates most with {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}bar{\}},e{\}}{\$} and velocity correlates most with mass. By comparing dynamical and baryonic masses, we find that galaxies at {\$}z\backslashsim 1.4-3.8{\$} are baryon dominated within their effective radii ({\$}R{\_}E{\$}), with Mdyn/Mbaryon increasing over time.

These metallicity histories, in combination with the associated star formation histories, allow us to analyse the inferred gas-phase mass--metallicity relation. Furthermore, we extract the mass--metallicity relation at a sequence of epochs in cosmic history, to track the evolving mass--metallicity relation with time. Through comparison with observations of gas-phase metallicity over a large range of redshifts, we show that, remarkably, our forensic SED analysis has produced an evolving mass--metallicity relationship that is consistent with observations at all epochs. We additionally analyse the three dimensional mass--metallicity--SFR space, showing that galaxies occupy a clearly defined plane. This plane is shown to be subtly evolving, displaying an increased tilt with time caused by general enrichment, and also the slowing down of star formation with cosmic time. This evolution is most apparent at lookback times greater than 7 Gyr. The trends in metallicity recovered in this work highlight that the evolving metallicity implementation used within the SED fitting code ProSpect produces reasonable metallicity results over the history of a galaxy. This is expected to provide a significant improvement to the accuracy of the SED fitting outputs.},

abstract = {Galaxy mergers trigger both star formation and accretion onto the central supermassive black hole. As a result of subsequent energetic feedback processes, it has long been proposed that star formation may be promptly extinguished in galaxy merger remnants. However, this prediction of widespread, rapid quenching in late stage mergers has been recently called into question with modern simulations and has never been tested observationally. Here we perform the first empirical assessment of the long-predicted end phase in the merger sequence. Based on a sample of {\~{}}500 post-mergers identified from the Ultraviolet Near Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS), we show that the frequency of post-merger galaxies that have rapidly shutdown their star formation following a previous starburst is 30-60 times higher than expected from a control sample of non-merging galaxies. No such excess is found in a sample of close galaxy pairs, demonstrating that mergers can indeed lead to a rapid halt to star formation, but that this process only manifests after coalescence.},

abstract = {The cold dark matter model has become the leading theoretical paradigm for the formation of structure in the Universe. Together with the theory of cosmic inflation, this model makes a clear prediction for the initial conditions for structure formation and predicts that structures grow hierarchically through gravitational instability. Testing this model requires that the precise measurements delivered by galaxy surveys can be compared to robust and equally precise theoretical calculations. Here we present a novel framework for the quantitative physical interpretation of such surveys. This combines the largest simulation of the growth of dark matter structure ever carried out with new techniques for following the formation and evolution of the visible components. We show that baryon-induced features in the initial conditions of the Universe are reflected in distorted form in the low-redshift galaxy distribution, an effect that can be used to constrain the nature of dark energy with next generation surveys.},

abstract = {The cosmic noon (z{\~{}}1.5-3) marked a period of vigorous star formation for most galaxies. However, about a third of the more massive galaxies at those times were quiescent in the sense that their observed stellar populations are inconsistent with rapid star formation. The reduced star formation activity is often attributed to gaseous outflows driven by feedback from supermassive black holes, but the impact of black hole feedback on galaxies in the young Universe is not yet definitively established. We analyze the origin of quiescent galaxies with the help of ultra-high resolution, cosmological simulations that include feedback from stars but do not model the uncertain consequences of black hole feedback. We show that dark matter halos with specific accretion rates below {\~{}}0.25-0.4 per Gyr preferentially host galaxies with reduced star formation rates and red broad-band colors. The fraction of such halos in large dark matter only simulations matches the observed fraction of massive quiescent galaxies ({\~{}}10{\^{}}10-10{\^{}}11 Msun). This strongly suggests that halo accretion rate is the key parameter determining which massive galaxies at z{\~{}}1.5-3 become quiescent. Empirical models that connect galaxy and halo evolution, such as halo occupation distribution or abundance matching models, assume a tight link between galaxy properties and the masses of their parent halos. These models will benefit from adding the specific accretion rate of halos as a second model parameter.},

abstract = {We study the volume-limited and nearly mass-selected (stellar mass Mstars ≳ 6 × 109 M⊙) ATLAS3D sample of 260 early-type galaxies (ETGs, ellipticals Es and lenticulars S0s). We construct detailed axisymmetric dynamical models (Jeans Anisotropic MGE), which allow for orbital anisotropy, include a dark matter halo and reproduce in detail both the galaxy images and the high-quality integral-field stellar kinematics out to about 1Re, the projected half-light radius. We derive accurate total mass-to-light ratios (M/L)e and dark matter fractions fDM, within a sphere of radius r = Re centred on the galaxies.We alsomeasure the stellar (M/L)stars and derive a median dark matter fraction fDM = 13 per cent in our sample. We infer masses MJAM = L × (M/L)e ≈ 2 ×M1/2, where M1/2 is the total mass within a sphere enclosing half of the galaxy light. We find that the thin two-dimensional subset spanned by galaxies in the (MJAM, $\sigma$e,Rmaje ) coordinates system, which we call the Mass Plane (MP) has an observed rms scatter of 19 per cent, which implies an intrinsic one of 11 per cent. Here, Rmaje is the major axis of an isophote enclosing half of the observed galaxy light, while $\sigma$e is measuredwithin that isophote. The MP satisfies the scalar virial relation MJAM ∝ $\sigma$2e Rmaje within our tight errors. This show that the larger scatter in the Fundamental Plane (FP) (L, $\sigma$e, Re) is due to stellar population effects [including trends in the stellar initial mass function (IMF)]. It confirms that the FP deviation from the virial exponents is due to a genuine (M/L)e variation. However, the details of how both Re and $\sigma$e are determined are critical in defining the precise deviation from the virial exponents. The main uncertainty in masses or M/L estimates using the scalar virial relation is in the measurement of Re. This problem is already relevant for nearby galaxies and may cause significant biases in virial mass and size determinations at high redshift. Dynamical models can eliminate these problems.We revisit the (M/L)e-$\sigma$e relation, which describes most of the deviations between the MP and the FP. The best-fitting relation is (M/L)e ∝ $\sigma$0.72e (r band). It provides an upper limit to any systematic increase of the IMF mass normalization with $\sigma$e. The correlation is more shallow and has smaller scatter for slow rotating systems or for galaxies in Virgo. For the latter, when using the best distance estimates, we observe a scatter in (M/L)e of 11 per cent, and infer an intrinsic one of 8 per cent. We perform an accurate empirical study of the link between se and the galaxies circular velocity Vcirc within 1Re (where stars dominate) and find the relation max (Vcirc) ≈ 1.76 × $\sigma$e, which has an observed scatter of 7 per cent. The accurate parameters described in this paper are used in the companion Paper XX (Cappellari et al.) of this series to explore the variation of global galaxy properties, including the IMF, on the projections of the MP. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

abstract = {One key problem in astrophysics is understanding how and why galaxies switch off their star formation, building the quiescent population that we observe in the local Universe. From the GAMA and VIPERS surveys, we use spectroscopic indices to select quiescent and candidate transition galaxies. We identify potentially rapidly transitioning post-starburst galaxies, and slower transitioning green-valley galaxies. Over the last 8 Gyrs the quiescent population has grown more slowly in number density at high masses (M{\$}{\_}*{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}{\$}M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}) than at intermediate masses (M{\$}{\_}*{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}10.6{\}}{\$}M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}). There is evolution in both the post-starburst and green valley stellar mass functions, consistent with higher mass galaxies quenching at earlier cosmic times. At intermediate masses (M{\$}{\_}*{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}10.6{\}}{\$}M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}) we find a green valley transition timescale of 2.6 Gyr. Alternatively, at {\$}z\backslashsim0.7{\$} the entire growth rate could be explained by fast-quenching post-starburst galaxies, with a visibility timescale of 0.5 Gyr. At lower redshift, the number density of post-starbursts is so low that an unphysically short visibility window would be required for them to contribute significantly to the quiescent population growth. The importance of the fast-quenching route may rapidly diminish at {\$}z{\textless}1{\$}. However, at high masses (M{\$}{\_}*{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}{\$}M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}), there is tension between the large number of candidate transition galaxies compared to the slow growth of the quiescent population. This could be resolved if not all high mass post-starburst and green-valley galaxies are transitioning from star-forming to quiescent, for example if they rejuvenate out of the quiescent population following the accretion of gas and triggering of star formation, or if they fail to completely quench their star formation.},

abstract = {We report measurements of the mass density, Omega{\_}M, and cosmological-constant energy density, Omega{\_}Lambda, of the universe based on the analysis of 42 Type Ia supernovae discovered by the Supernova Cosmology Project. The magnitude-redshift data for these SNe, at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83, are fit jointly with a set of SNe from the Calan/Tololo Supernova Survey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological parameters. All SN peak magnitudes are standardized using a SN Ia lightcurve width-luminosity relation. The measurement yields a joint probability distribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by the relation 0.8 Omega{\_}M - 0.6 Omega{\_}Lambda {\~{}}= -0.2 +/- 0.1 in the region of interest (Omega{\_}M {\textless}{\~{}} 1.5). For a flat (Omega{\_}M + Omega{\_}Lambda = 1) cosmology we find Omega{\_}M = 0.28{\{}+0.09,-0.08{\}} (1 sigma statistical) {\{}+0.05,-0.04{\}} (identified systematics). The data are strongly inconsistent with a Lambda = 0 flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. An open, Lambda = 0 cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological constant is non-zero and positive, with a confidence of P(Lambda {\textgreater} 0) = 99{\%}, including the identified systematic uncertainties. The best-fit age of the universe relative to the Hubble time is t{\_}0 = 14.9{\{}+1.4,-1.1{\}} (0.63/h) Gyr for a flat cosmology. The size of our sample allows us to perform a variety of statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We find no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution or Malmquist bias between the low-redshift Calan/Tololo sample and our high-redshift sample. The conclusions are robust whether or not a width-luminosity relation is used to standardize the SN peak magnitudes.},

abstract = {Ever deeper and wider lookback surveys have led to a fairly robust outline of the cosmic star-formation history, which culminated around z∼2; this period is often nicknamed “cosmic noon.” Our knowledge about star-forming galaxies at these epochs has dramatically advanced from increasingly complete population censuses and detailed views of individual galaxies. We highlight some of the key observational insights that influenced our current understanding of galaxy evolution in the equilibrium growth picture: ▪ Scaling relations between galaxy properties are fairly well established among massive galaxies at least out to z∼2, pointing to regulating mechanisms already acting on galaxy growth. ▪ Resolved views reveal that gravitational instabilities and efficient secular processes within the gas- and baryon-rich galaxies at z∼2 play an important role in the early buildup of galactic structure. ▪ Ever more sensitive observations of kinematics at z∼2 are probing the baryon and dark matter budget on galactic scales and the links between star-forming galaxies and their likely descendants. ▪ Toward higher masses, massive bulges, dense cores, and powerful AGN and AGN-driven outflows are more prevalent and likely play a role in quenching star formation.We outline emerging questions and exciting prospects for the next decade with upcoming instrumentation, including the James Webb Space Telescope and the next generation of extremely large telescopes.Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Astronomy and Astrophysics, Volume 58 is August 18, 2020.

abstract = {We introduce the first two simulations of the IllustrisTNG project, a next generation of cosmological magnetohydrodynamical simulations, focusing on the optical colors of galaxies. We explore TNG100, a rerun of the original Illustris box, and TNG300, which includes 2x2500{\^{}}3 resolution elements in a volume twenty times larger. Here we present first results on the galaxy color bimodality at low redshift. Accounting for the attenuation of stellar light by dust, we compare the simulated (g-r) colors of 10{\^{}}9 {\textless} M*/Msun {\textless} 10{\^{}}12.5 galaxies to the observed distribution from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We find a striking improvement with respect to the original Illustris simulation, as well as excellent quantitative agreement in comparison to the observations, with a sharp transition in median color from blue to red at a characteristic M* {\~{}} 10{\^{}}10.5 Msun. Investigating the build-up of the color-mass plane and the formation of the red sequence, we demonstrate that the primary driver of galaxy color transition in the TNG model is supermassive blackhole feedback in its low-accretion state. Across the entire population we measure a median color transition timescale dt{\_}green of {\~{}}1.6 Gyr, a value which drops for increasingly massive galaxies. We find signatures of the physical process of quenching: at fixed stellar mass, redder galaxies have lower SFRs, gas fractions, and gas metallicities; their stellar populations are also older and their large-scale interstellar magnetic fields weaker than in bluer galaxies. Finally, we measure the amount of stellar mass growth on the red sequence. Galaxies with M* {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}11 Msun which redden at z{\textless}1 accumulate on average {\~{}}25{\%} of their final z=0 mass post-reddening; at the same time, {\~{}}18{\%} of such massive galaxies acquire half or more of their final stellar mass while on the red sequence.},

abstract = {We use a large sample of galaxies from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) to calculate galaxy luminosity and stellar mass functions in the local Universe. We estimate k-corrections, evolution corrections, and stellar mass-to-light ratios (M/Ls) by fitting the galaxy colors with simple models. Our optical and near-infrared luminosity functions agree with most recent literature optical and near-infrared determinations within the uncertainties. We argue that 2MASS is biased against low surface brightness galaxies, and use SDSS plus our knowledge of stellar populations to estimate that the true K-band luminosity function has a steeper faint end slope than the direct estimate. Assuming a universally-applicable stellar initial mass function (IMF), we derive the stellar mass function of galaxies. The faint end slope slope for the stellar mass function is steeper than -1.1, reflecting the low stellar M/Ls characteristic of low-mass galaxies. We estimate an upper limit to the stellar mass density in the local Universe Omega* h = 0.0020+/-0.0006 by assuming an IMF as rich in low-mass stars as allowed by observations of galaxy dynamics. Finally, we find that the characteristic luminosity or mass of early-type galaxies is larger than for later types, and the faint end slope is steeper for later types than for earlier types. Accounting for typing uncertainties, we estimate that at least half, and perhaps as much as 3/4, of the stellar mass in the Universe is in early-type galaxies. We present also SDSS/2MASS color-M/L correlations, an updated discussion of near-infrared stellar M/L estimates, and the volume-corrected distribution of g and K-band stellar M/Ls as a function of stellar mass.

abstract = {Thanks to its outstanding angular resolution, the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) has recently unambiguously identified a population of optically dark galaxies with redshifts greater than z = 3, which play an important role in the cosmic star formation in massive galaxies. In this paper we study the properties of the six optically dark galaxies detected in the 69 arcmin 2 GOODS-ALMA 1.1 mm continuum survey. While none of them are listed in the deepest H -band based CANDELS catalog in the GOODS-South field down to H = 28.16 AB, we were able to de-blend two of them from their bright neighbor and measure an H -band flux for them. We present the spectroscopic scan follow-up of five of the six sources with ALMA band 4. All are detected in the 2 mm continuum with signal-to-noise ratios higher than eight. One emission line is detected in AGS4 ( $\nu$ obs = 151.44 GHz with an S / N = 8.58) and AGS17 ( $\nu$ obs = 154.78 GHz with an S / N = 10.23), which we interpret in both cases as being due to the CO(6–5) line at z spec AGS4 = 3.556 and z spec AGS17 = 3.467, respectively. These redshifts match both the probability distribution of the photometric redshifts derived from the UV to near-infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and the far-infrared SEDs for typical dust temperatures of galaxies at these redshifts. We present evidence that nearly 70{\%} (4/6 of galaxies) of the optically dark galaxies belong to the same overdensity of galaxies at z ∼ 3.5. overdensity The most massive one, AGS24 ( M ⋆ = 10 11.32 −0.19 +0.02 M ⊙ ), is the most massive galaxy without an active galactic nucleus at z {\textgreater} 3 in the GOODS-ALMA field. It falls in the very center of the peak of the galaxy surface density, which suggests that the surrounding overdensity is a proto-cluster in the process of virialization and that AGS24 is the candidate progenitor of the future brightest cluster galaxy.},

abstract = {The Herschel Space Observatory has revealed a very different galaxyscape from that shown by optical surveys which presents a challenge for galaxy-evolution models. The Herschel surveys reveal (1) that there was rapid galaxy evolution in the very recent past and (2) that galaxies lie on a a single Galaxy Sequence (GS) rather than a star-forming `main sequence' and a separate region of `passive' or `red-and-dead' galaxies. The form of the GS is now clearer because far-infrared surveys such as the Herschel ATLAS pick up a population of optically-red star-forming galaxies that would have been classified as passive using most optical criteria. The space-density of this population is at least as high as the traditional star-forming population. By stacking spectra of H-ATLAS galaxies over the redshift range 0.001 {\textless} z {\textless} 0.4, we show that the galaxies responsible for the rapid low-redshift evolution have high stellar masses, high star-formation rates but, even several billion years in the past, old stellar populations - they are thus likely to be relatively recent ancestors of early-type galaxies in the Universe today. The form of the GS is inconsistent with rapid quenching models and neither the analytic bathtub model nor the hydrodynamical EAGLE simulation can reproduce the rapid cosmic evolution. We propose a new gentler model of galaxy evolution that can explain the new Herschel results and other key properties of the galaxy population.},

abstract = {We use a large sample of galaxies at z{\~{}}3 to establish a relationship between reddening, neutral gas covering fraction (fcov(HI)), and the escape of ionizing photons at high redshift. Our sample includes 933 galaxies at z{\~{}}3, 121 of which have very deep spectroscopic observations ({\textgreater}7 hrs) in the rest-UV (lambda=850-1300 A) with Keck/LRIS. Based on the high covering fraction of outflowing optically-thick HI indicated by the composite spectra of these galaxies, we conclude that photoelectric absorption, rather than dust attenuation, dominates the depletion of ionizing photons. By modeling the composite spectra as the combination of an unattenuated stellar spectrum including nebular continuum emission with one that is absorbed by HI and reddened by a line-of-sight extinction, we derive an empirical relationship between E(B-V) and fcov(HI). Galaxies with redder UV continua have larger covering fractions of HI characterized by higher line-of-sight extinctions. Our results are consistent with the escape of Lya through gas-free lines-of-sight. Covering fractions based on low-ionization interstellar absorption lines systematically underpredict those deduced from the HI lines, suggesting that much of the outflowing gas may be metal-poor. We develop a model which connects the ionizing escape fraction with E(B-V), and which may be used to estimate the escape fraction for an ensemble of high-redshift galaxies. Alternatively, direct measurements of the escape fraction for our data allow us to constrain the intrinsic 900-to-1500 A flux density ratio to be {\textgreater}0.20, a value that favors stellar population models that include weaker stellar winds, a flatter initial mass function, and/or binary evolution. Lastly, we demonstrate how the framework discussed here may be used to assess the pathways by which ionizing radiation escapes from high-redshift galaxies. [Abridged]},

abstract = {The spectral absorption lines in early-type galaxies contain a wealth of information regarding the detailed abundance pattern, star formation history, and stellar initial mass function (IMF) of the underlying stellar population. Using our new population synthesis model that accounts for the effect of variable abundance ratios of 11 elements, we analyze very high quality absorption line spectra of 38 early-type galaxies and the nuclear bulge of M31. These data extend to 1um and they therefore include the IMF-sensitive spectral features NaI, CaII, and FeH at 0.82um, 0.86um and 0.99um, respectively. The models fit the data well, with typical rms residuals {\~{}}1{\%}. Strong constraints on the IMF and therefore the stellar mass-to-light ratio, (M/L){\_}stars, are derived for individual galaxies. We find that the IMF becomes increasingly bottom-heavy with increasing velocity dispersion and [Mg/Fe]. At the lowest dispersions and [Mg/Fe] values the derived IMF is consistent with the Milky Way IMF, while at the highest dispersions and [Mg/Fe] values the derived IMF contains more low-mass stars (is more bottom-heavy) than even a Salpeter IMF. Our best-fit (M/L){\_}stars values do not exceed dynamically-based M/L values. We also apply our models to stacked spectra of four metal-rich globular clusters in M31 and find an (M/L){\_}stars that implies fewer low-mass stars than a Milky Way IMF, again agreeing with dynamical constraints. We discuss other possible explanations for the observed trends and conclude that variation in the IMF is the simplest and most plausible.},

We perform a near-IR observational campaign using Keck/NIRSPEC, VLT/X-shooter, and Gemini/GNIRS to measure rest-frame optical spectra of 28 ERQs with median infrared luminosity 〈log L(erg s−1)〉 ∼ 46.2. They exhibit the broadest and most blueshifted [O iii] $\lambda$4959,5007 emission lines ever reported, with widths (w90) ranging between 2053 and 7227 km s−1, and maximum outflow speeds (v98) up to 6702 km s−1. ERQs on average have [O iii] outflows velocities about three times larger than those of luminosity-matched blue quasar samples. This discrepancy can be explained by a strong correlation between [O iii] kinematics and i–W3 colour, and not by radio loudness, or higher Eddington ratios. We estimate for these objects that at least 3–5 per cent of their bolometric luminosity is being converted into the kinetic power of the observed wind. Our results reveal that ERQs have the potential to strongly affect the evolution of host galaxies.},

abstract = {Galaxy quenching is a critical step in galaxy evolution. In this work, we present a statistical study of galaxy quenching in 17 cluster candidates at 0.5{\textless}z{\textless}1.0 in the COSMOS field. We selected cluster members with a wide range of stellar mass and environment to study their mass and environment dependence. Member galaxies are classified into star-forming, quiescent and recently-quenched galaxies (RQG) using the rest-frame UVJ diagram. We further separated fast and slow quenching RQGs by model evolutionary tracks on the UVJ diagram. We defined the quenching efficiency as the ratio of RQGs over star-forming galaxies and the quenching stage as the ratio of RQGs over quiescent galaxies to quantify the quenching processes. We found quenching efficiency is enhanced by both higher stellar mass and denser environment. Massive or dense environment galaxies quench earlier. Slow quenching is more dominant for massive galaxies and at lower redshifts, but no clear dependence on the environment is found. Our results suggest that low-mass galaxies in dense environments are likely quenched through a short-timescale process such as ram pressure stripping, while massive galaxies in a sparse environment are mostly quenched by a longer-timescale process. Using the line strength of H{\$}\backslashdelta{\$} and [OII], we confirmed that our UVJ method to select RQGs agrees with high S/N DEIMOS spectra. However, we caution that the visibility time (duration of a galaxy's stay in the RQG region on the UVJ diagram) may also depend on mass or environment. The method introduced in this work can be applied to RQG candidates for future statistical RQG spectroscopic surveys. The systematic spectroscopic RQG study will disentangle the degeneracy between visibility time and quenching properties.},

abstract = {We present a new analysis of the dust obscuration in starburst galaxies at low and high redshift. This study is motivated by our unique sample of the most extreme UV-selected starburst galaxies in the nearby universe (z{\textless}0.3), found to be good analogs of high-redshift Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) in most of their physical properties. We find that the dust properties of the Lyman Break Analogs (LBAs) are consistent with the relation derived previously by Meurer et al. (M99) that is commonly used to dust-correct star formation rate measurements at a very wide range of redshifts. We directly compare our results with high redshift samples (LBGs, BzK, and sub-mm galaxies at z=2-3) having IR data either from Spitzer or Herschel. The attenuation in typical LBGs at z=2-3 and LBAs is very similar. Because LBAs are much better analogs to LBGs compared to previous local star-forming samples, including M99, the practice of dust-correcting the SFRs of high redshift galaxies based on the local calibration is now placed on a much more solid ground. We illustrate the importance of this result by showing how the locally calibrated relation between UV measurements and extinction is used to estimate the integrated, dust-corrected star formation rate density at z=2-6.},

abstract = {The traditional picture of post-starburst galaxies as dust- and gas-poor merger remnants, rapidly transitioning to quiescence, has been recently challenged. Unexpected detections of a significant ISM in many post-starbursts raise important questions. Are they truly quiescent and, if so, what mechanisms inhibit further star formation? What processes dominate their ISM energetics? We present an infrared spectroscopic and photometric survey of 33 SDSS-selected E+A post-starbursts, aimed at resolving these questions. We find compact, warm dust reservoirs with high PAH abundances, and total gas and dust masses significantly higher than expected from stellar recycling alone. Both PAH/TIR and dust-to-burst stellar mass ratios are seen to decrease with post-burst age, indicative of the accumulating effects of dust destruction and an incipient transition to hot, early-type ISM properties. Their infrared spectral properties are unique, with dominant PAH emission, very weak nebular lines, unusually strong H{\$}{\_}{\{}2{\}}{\$} rotational emission, and deep {\$}{\{}\backslashrm [C\backslash, II]{\}}{\$} deficits. There is substantial scatter among SFR indicators, and both PAH and TIR luminosities provide overestimates. Even as potential upper limits, all tracers show that the SFR has typically experienced a more than two order-of-magnitude decline since the starburst, and that the SFR is considerably lower than expected given both their stellar masses and molecular gas densities. These results paint a coherent picture of systems in which star formation was, indeed, rapidly truncated, but in which the ISM was {\$}\backslashtextit{\{}not{\}}{\$} completely expelled, and is instead supported against collapse by latent or continued injection of turbulent or mechanical heating. The resulting aging burst populations provide a "high-soft" radiation field which seemingly dominates the E+As' unusual ISM energetics.},

abstract = {We reliably extend the stellar mass–size relation over 0.2 ≤ z ≤ 2 to low stellar mass galaxies by combining the depth of Hubble Frontier Fields with the large volume covered by CANDELS. Galaxies are simultaneously modelled in multiple bands using the tools developed by the MegaMorph project, allowing robust size (i.e. half-light radius) estimates even for small, faint, and high redshift galaxies. We show that above 107 M, star-forming galaxies are well represented by a single power law on the mass–size plane over our entire redshift range. Conversely, the stellar mass–size relation is steep for quiescent galaxies with stellar masses ≥ 1010.3 M and flattens at lower masses, regardless of whether quiescence is selected based on star-formation activity, rest-frame colours, or structural characteristics. This flattening occurs at sizes of ∼1 kpc at z ≤ 1. As a result, a double power law is preferred for the stellar mass–size relation of quiescent galaxies, at least above 107 M. We find no strong redshift dependence in the slope of the relation of star-forming galaxies as well as of high mass quiescent galaxies. We also show that star-forming galaxies with stellar masses ≥ 109.5 M and quiescent galaxies with stellar masses ≥ 1010.3 M have undergone significant size growth since z ∼ 2, as expected; however, low mass galaxies have not. Finally, we supplement our data with predominantly quiescent dwarf galaxies from the core of the Fornax cluster, showing that the stellar mass–size relation is continuous below 107 M, but a more complicated functional form is necessary to describe the relation.},

abstract = {In the early Universe, while galaxies were still forming, black holes as massive as a billion solar masses powered quasars. Supermassive black holes are found at the centres of most galaxies today, where their masses are related to the velocity dispersions of stars in their host galaxies and hence to the mass of the central bulge of the galaxy. This suggests a link between the growth of the black holes and their host galaxies, which has indeed been assumed for a number of years. But the origin of the observed relation between black hole mass and stellar velocity dispersion, and its connection with the evolution of galaxies, have remained unclear. Here we report simulations that simultaneously follow star formation and the growth of black holes during galaxy-galaxy collisions. We find that, in addition to generating a burst of star formation, a merger leads to strong inflows that feed gas to the supermassive black hole and thereby power the quasar. The energy released by the quasar expels enough gas to quench both star formation and further black hole growth. This determines the lifetime of the quasar phase (approaching 100 million years) and explains the relationship between the black hole mass and the stellar velocity dispersion.},

abstract = {The Spitzer-Cosmic Assembly Deep Near-infrared Extragalactic Legacy Survey (S-CANDELS; PI G.Fazio) is a Cycle 8 Exploration Program designed to detect galaxies at very high redshifts (). To mitigate the effects of cosmic variance and also to take advantage of deep coextensive coverage in multiple bands by the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Multi-cycle Treasury Program CANDELS, S-CANDELS was carried out within five widely separated extragalactic fields: the UKIDSS Ultra-deep Survey, the Extended Chandra Deep Field South, COSMOS, the HST Deep Field North, and the Extended Groth Strip. S-CANDELS builds upon the existing coverage of these fields from the Spitzer Extended Deep Survey (SEDS), a Cycle 6 Exploration Program, by increasing the integration time from SEDS' 12 hr to a total of 50 hr but within a smaller area, 0.16 deg2. The additional depth significantly increases the survey completeness at faint magnitudes. This paper describes the S-CANDELS survey design, processing, and publicly available data products. We present Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) dual-band catalogs reaching to a depth of 26.5 AB mag. Deep IRAC counts for the roughly 135,000 galaxies detected by S-CANDELS are consistent with models based on known galaxy populations. The increase in depth beyond earlier Spitzer/IRAC surveys does not reveal a significant additional contribution from discrete sources to the diffuse Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB). Thus it remains true that only roughly half of the estimated CIB flux from COBE/DIRBE is resolved.},

abstract = {We report the discovery of MAGAZ3NE J095924+022537, a spectroscopically confirmed protocluster at z = 3.3665 − 0.0012 + 0.0009 around a spectroscopically confirmed UVJ -quiescent ultramassive galaxy (UMG; M ⋆ = 2.34 − 0.34 + 0.23 × 10 11 M ⊙ ) in the COSMOS UltraVISTA field. We present a total of 38 protocluster members (14 spectroscopic and 24 photometric), including the UMG. Notably, and in marked contrast to protoclusters previously reported at this epoch that have been found to contain predominantly star-forming members, we measure an elevated fraction of quiescent galaxies relative to the coeval field ( 73.3 − 16.9 + 26.7 {\%} versus 11.6 − 4.9 + 7.1 {\%} for galaxies with stellar mass M ⋆ ≥ 10 11 M ⊙ ). This high quenched fraction provides a striking and important counterexample to the seeming ubiquitousness of star-forming galaxies in protoclusters at z {\textgreater} 2 and suggests, rather, that protoclusters exist in a diversity of evolutionary states in the early universe. We discuss the possibility that we might be observing either “early mass quenching” or nonclassical “environmental quenching.” We also present the discovery of MAGAZ3NE J100028+023349, a second spectroscopically confirmed protocluster, at a very similar redshift of z = 3.3801 − 0.0281 + 0.0213 . We present a total of 20 protocluster members, 12 of which are photometric and eight spectroscopic including a poststarburst UMG ( M ⋆ = 2.95 − 0.20 + 0.21 × 10 11 M ⊙ ). Protoclusters MAGAZ3NE J0959 and MAGAZ3NE J1000 are separated by 18′ on the sky (35 comoving Mpc), in good agreement with predictions from simulations for the size of “Coma”-type cluster progenitors at this epoch. It is highly likely that the two UMGs are the progenitors of Brightest Cluster Galaxies seen in massive virialized clusters at lower redshift.},

abstract = {We analyse 14 LBGs at z{\~{}}2.8-3.8 constituting the only sample where both a spectroscopic measurement of their metallicity and deep IR observations (CANDELS+HUGS survey) are available. Fixing the metallicity of population synthesis models to the observed values, we determine best-fit physical parameters under different assumptions on the star-formation history and considering also the effect of nebular emission. For comparison we determine the UV slope of the objects, and use it to estimate their SFR{\_}UV99 by correcting the UV luminosity following Meurer et al. (1999). A comparison between SFR obtained through SED-fitting (SFR{\_}fit) and the SFR{\_}UV99 shows that the latter are underestimated by a factor 2-10, regardless of the assumed SFH. Other SFR indicators (radio, far-IR, X-ray, recombination lines) coherently indicate SFRs a factor 2-4 larger than SFR{\_}UV99 and in closer agreement with SFR{\_}fit. Such discrepancy is due to the solar metallicity implied by the usual beta-A1600 conversion factor. We propose a refined relation, appropriate for sub-solar metallicity LBGs: A1600 = 5.32+1.99beta. This relation reconciles the dust-corrected UV with the SED-fitting and the other SFR indicators. We show that the fact that z{\~{}}3 galaxies have sub-solar metallicity implies an upward revision by a factor of {\~{}}1.5-2 of the global SFRD, depending on the assumptions on the age of the stellar populations. We find very young best-fit ages (10-500 Myrs) for all our objects. From a careful examination of the uncertainties in the fit and the amplitude of the Balmer break we conclude that there is little evidence for the presence of old stellar population in at least half of the LBGs in our sample, suggesting that these objects are probably caught during a huge star-formation burst, rather than being the result of a smooth evolution.},

Cluster members are selected by a photometric-redshift criterion, and categorized as star-forming, quiescent, or intermediate according to their dust-corrected rest-frame colors and magnitudes. We employ a "delayed-then-rapid" quenching model that relates a simulated cluster mass accretion rate to the observed numbers of each type of galaxy in the cluster to constrain {\$}t{\_}Q{\$}. For galaxies of mass {\$}M{\_}* \backslashgtrsim 10{\^{}}{\{}10.5{\}}{\~{}} \backslashmathrm{\{}M{\}}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}, we find a quenching timescale of {\$}t{\_}Q={\$} 1.24 Gyr in the {\$}z\backslashsim1.5{\$} cluster sample, and {\$}t{\_}Q={\$} 1.50 Gyr at {\$}z\backslashsim1{\$}. Using values drawn from the literature, we compare the redshift evolution of {\$}t{\_}Q{\$} to timescales predicted for different physical quenching mechanisms. We find {\$}t{\_}Q{\$} to depend on host halo mass such that quenching occurs over faster timescales in clusters relative to groups, suggesting that properties of the host halo are responsible for quenching high-mass galaxies. The environmental quenching timescale evolves faster from {\$}z=0{\$} to {\$}z=1.5{\$} than the molecular gas depletion timescale and slower than an SFR-outflow timescale, but is consistent with the evolution of the dynamical time. Between {\$}z=0{\$} and {\$}z=1.5{\$}, we find that {\$}t{\_}Q{\$} evolves faster than the molecular gas depletion timescale and slower than an SFR-outflow timescale, but is consistent with the evolution of the dynamical time. This suggests that environmental quenching in these galaxies is driven by the motion of satellites relative to the cluster environment, although due to uncertainties in the atomic gas budget at high redshift, we cannot rule out quenching due to simple gas depletion.},

abstract = {We use a statistical approach to study the evolution of the star-forming galaxy (SFG) main sequence (MS) and the fraction of dust-obscured star formation up to {\$}z\backslashsim4{\$}. We use the following observables: the far-ultraviolet, FUV, and the infrared, IR, luminosity functions, LFs, and the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) of SFGs. Our derived total (FUV+IR) star formation rates, SFR, reproduce the evolution of the MS as compared to a set of independent observational inferences. At any redshift, we find that the specific SFR{\$}-M{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}}{\$} relation for MS SFGs approaches to a power law at the high-mass end. At lower masses it bends and eventually the slope sign changes from negative to positive at very low masses. At {\$}z\backslashsim0{\$}, this change of sign is at {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}}\backslashsim5\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}8{\}} M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} close to dust-obscured star formation regime, {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashast{\}}\backslashsim6\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}8{\}}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}. The slope sign change is related to the knee of the FUV LF. We predict that the assembly time of nearby dwarf galaxies is {\$}\backslashsim10{\$} Gyrs consistent with their oldest observed stellar populations. Our derived dust-obscured fractions agree with previous determinations at {\$}0\backslashleq z\backslashleq2.5{\$}. The dust-obscured fraction depends strongly on mass with almost no dependence with redshift above {\$}z\backslashsim1.2{\$}. At {\$}z\backslashlesssim0.75{\$} high-mass galaxies become more ``transparent" compared to their high redshift counterparts. On the opposite, low- and intermediate-mass galaxies have become more obscured by dust. Using the joint evolution of the GSMF and the FUV and IR LFs is a promising empirical approach to study the stellar mass growth and dust formation/destruction mechanisms, and ultimately to constrain galaxy formation models.},

This protocluster is characterized by both the large overdensity of spectroscopically confirmed members, $\delta$gal = 10.5 ± 2.8, and a significant overdensity in photometric redshift members. The halo mass of this protocluster is estimated by a variety of methods to be ∼3 × 1014 at z ∼ 3.3, which, evolved to z = 0 results in a halo mass rivaling or exceeding that of the Coma cluster. The properties of 19 spectroscopically confirmed member galaxies are compared with a large sample of VUDS/VVDS galaxies in lower density field environments at similar redshifts. We find tentative evidence for an excess of redder, brighter, and more massive galaxies within the confines of the protocluster relative to the field population, which suggests that we may be observing the beginning ofenvironmentally induced quenching. The properties of these galaxies are investigated, including a discussion of the brightest protocluster galaxy, which appears to be undergoing vigorous coeval nuclear and starburst activity. The remaining member galaxies appear to have characteristics that are largely similar to the field population. Though we find weaker evidence of the suppression of the median star formation rates among and differences in the stacked spectra of member galaxies with respect to the field, we defer any conclusions about these trends to future work with the ensemble of protostructures that are found in the full VUDS sample.},

As well as providing a compact representation of the wide variety of SED shapes, the method allows for easy visualisation of information loss and biases caused by the incomplete sampling of the rest-frame SED as a function of redshift. We apply the method to galaxies in the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey with 0.9 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.2, and con-firm our classifications by stacking rest-frame optical spectra for a fraction of objects in each class. As well as cleanly separating a tight red-sequence from star-forming galaxies, three unusual populations are identifiable by their unique colours: very dusty star-forming galax-ies with high metallicity and old mean stellar age; post-starburst galaxies which have formed of their mass in a recent unsustained starburst event; and metal-poor quiescent dwarf galaxies. We find that quiescent galaxies account for 45{\%} of galaxies with log M * /M {\textgreater} 11, declining steadily to 13{\%} at log M * /M = 10. The properties and mass-function of the post-starburst galaxies are consistent with a scenario in which gas-rich mergers contribute to the growth of the low and intermediate mass range of the red sequence.},

abstract = {The "green valley" is a wide region separating the blue and the red peaks in the ultraviolet-optical color magnitude diagram, first revealed using GALEX UV photometry. The term was coined by Christopher Martin in 2005. Green valley highlights the discriminating power of UV to very low relative levels of ongoing star formation, to which the optical colors, including u-r, are insensitive. It corresponds to massive galaxies below the star-forming "main" sequence, and therefore represents a critical tool for the study of the quenching of star formation and its possible resurgence in otherwise quiescent galaxies. This article reviews the results pertaining to morphology, structure, environment, dust content and gas properties of green valley galaxies in the local universe. Their relationship to AGN is also discussed. Attention is given to biases emerging from defining the "green valley" using optical colors. We review various evolutionary scenarios and we present evidence for a new, quasi-static view of the green valley, in which the majority of galaxies currently in the green valley were only partially quenched in the distant past and now participate in a slow cosmic decline of star formation, which also drives down the activity on the main sequence, presumably as a result of the dwindling accretion/cooling onto galaxy disks.},

abstract = {The dimming of Type Ia supernovae could be the result of Hubble-scale inhomogeneity in the matter and spatial curvature, rather than signaling the presence of a dark energy component. A key challenge for such models is to fit the detailed spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We present a detailed discussion of the small-scale CMB in an inhomogeneous universe, focusing on spherically symmetric `void' models. We allow for the dynamical effects of radiation while analyzing the problem, in contrast to other work which inadvertently fine tunes its spatial profile. This is a surprisingly important effect and we reach substantially different conclusions. Models which are open at CMB distances fit the CMB power spectrum without fine tuning; these models also fit the supernovae and local Hubble rate data which favours a high expansion rate. Asymptotically flat models may fit the CMB, but require some extra assumptions. We argue that a full treatment of the radiation in these models is necessary if we are to understand the correct constraints from the CMB, as well as other observations which rely on it, such as spectral distortions of the black body spectrum, the kinematic Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect or the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations.},

abstract = {The Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) Large Program to INvestigate [CII] at Early times (ALPINE) targets the [CII] 158 $\mu$m line and the far-infrared continuum in 118 spectroscopically confirmed star-forming galaxies between z = 4.4 and z = 5.9. It represents the first large [CII] statistical sample built in this redshift range. We present details regarding the data processing and the construction of the catalogs. We detected 23 of our targets in the continuum. To derive accurate infrared luminosities and obscured star formation rates (SFRs), we measured the conversion factor from the ALMA 158 $\mu$m rest-frame dust continuum luminosity to the total infrared luminosity (LIR) after constraining the dust spectral energy distribution by stacking a photometric sample similar to ALPINE in ancillary single-dish far-infrared data. We found that our continuum detections have a median LIR of 4.4 × 1011 L{\textperiodcentered}. We also detected 57 additional continuum sources in our ALMA pointings. They are at a lower redshift than the ALPINE targets, with a mean photometric redshift of 2.5 ± 0.2. We measured the 850 $\mu$m number counts between 0.35 and 3.5 mJy, thus improving the current interferometric constraints in this flux density range. We found a slope break in the number counts around 3 mJy with a shallower slope below this value. More than 40{\%} of the cosmic infrared background is emitted by sources brighter than 0.35 mJy. Finally, we detected the [CII] line in 75 of our targets. Their median [CII] luminosity is 4.8 × 108 L{\textperiodcentered} and their median full width at half maximum is 252 km s-1. After measuring the mean obscured SFR in various [CII] luminosity bins by stacking ALPINE continuum data, we find a good agreement between our data and the local and predicted SFR-L[CII] relations.},

In particular, we report Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) detections of the [OI]145um and [OIII]88um lines and Atacama Compact Array (ACA) detections of the [NII]122 and 205um lines. The [OI]145um / [CII]158um line ratio is {\~{}}5x higher compared to the average of local galaxies. We interpret this as evidence that the ISM is dominated by photo-dissociation regions with high gas densities. The line ratios, and in particular those of [OIII]88um and [NII]122um imply that the ISM in SPT0418-47 is already chemically enriched close to solar metallicity. While the strong gravitational amplification was required to detect these lines with APEX, larger samples can be observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), and should allow to determine if the observed dense, solar metallicity ISM is common among these highly star-forming galaxies.},

abstract = {We present multi-band photometry of 185 type-Ia supernovae (SN Ia), with over 11500 observations. These were acquired between 2001 and 2008 at the F. L. Whipple Observatory of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA). This sample contains the largest number of homogeneously-observed and reduced nearby SN Ia (z {\textless} 0.08) published to date. It more than doubles the nearby sample, bringing SN Ia cosmology to the point where systematic uncertainties dominate. Our natural system photometry has a precision of 0.02 mag or better in BVRIr'i' and roughly 0.04 mag in U for points brighter than 17.5 mag. We also estimate a systematic uncertainty of 0.03 mag in our SN Ia standard system BVRIr'i' photometry and 0.07 mag for U. Comparisons of our standard system photometry with published SN Ia light curves and comparison stars, where available for the same SN, reveal agreement at the level of a few hundredths mag in most cases. We find that 1991bg-like SN Ia are sufficiently distinct from other SN Ia in their color and light-curve-shape/luminosity relation that they should be treated separately in light-curve/distance fitter training samples. The CfA3 sample will contribute to the development of better light-curve/distance fitters, particularly in the few dozen cases where near-infrared photometry has been obtained and, together, can help disentangle host-galaxy reddening from intrinsic supernova color, reducing the systematic uncertainty in SN Ia distances due to dust.},

abstract = {Quasar emission lines are often shifted from the systemic velocity due to various dynamical and radiative processes in the line-emitting region. The level of these velocity shifts depends both on the line species and on quasar properties. We study velocity shifts for the line peaks of various narrow and broad quasar emission lines relative to systemic using a sample of 849 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping (SDSS-RM) project. The coadded (from 32 epochs) spectra of individual quasars have sufficient signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) to measure stellar absorption lines to provide reliable systemic velocity estimates, as well as weak narrow emission lines. The sample also covers a large dynamic range in quasar luminosity ({\~{}}2 dex), allowing us to explore potential luminosity dependence of the velocity shifts. We derive average line peak velocity shifts as a function of quasar luminosity for different lines, and quantify their intrinsic scatter. We further quantify how well the peak velocity can be measured for various lines as a function of continuum SNR, and demonstrate there is no systematic bias in the line peak measurements when the spectral quality is degraded to as low as SNR{\~{}}3 per SDSS pixel. Based on the observed line shifts, we provide empirical guidelines on redshift estimation from [OII]3728, [OIII]5008, [NeV]3426, MgII, CIII], HeII1640, broad Hbeta, CIV, and SiIV, which are calibrated to provide unbiased systemic redshifts in the mean, but with increasing intrinsic uncertainties of 46, 56, 119, 205, 233, 242, 400, 415, and 477 km/s, in addition to the measurement uncertainties. These more realistic redshift uncertainties are generally much larger than the formal uncertainties reported by the redshift pipelines for spectroscopic quasar surveys, and demonstrate the infeasibility of measuring quasar redshifts to better than {\~{}}200 km/s with only broad lines.},

abstract = {We present a new two-color algorithm, the "Stellar Bump Sequence" (SBS), that is optimized for robustly identifying candidate high-redshift galaxy clusters in combined wide-field optical and mid-infrared (MIR) data. The SBS algorithm is a fusion of the well-tested cluster red-sequence method of Gladders {\&} Yee with the MIR 3.6 $\mu$m-4.5 $\mu$m cluster detection method developed by Papovich. As with the cluster red-sequence method, the SBS identifies candidate overdensities within 3.6 $\mu$m-4.5 $\mu$m color slices, which are the equivalent of a rest-frame 1.6 $\mu$m stellar bump "red-sequence." In addition to employing the MIR colors of galaxies, the SBS algorithm incorporates an optical/MIR (z'-3.6 $\mu$m) color cut. This cut effectively eliminates foreground 0.2 {\textless}z {\textless} 0.4 galaxies which have 3.6 $\mu$m-4.5 $\mu$m colors that are similarly red as z {\textgreater} 1.0 galaxies and add noise when searching for high-redshift galaxy overdensities. We demonstrate using the z {\~{}} 1 GCLASS cluster sample that similar to the red sequence, the stellar bump sequence appears to be a ubiquitous feature of high-redshift clusters, and that within that sample the color of the stellar bump sequence increases monotonically with redshift and provides photometric redshifts accurate to $\Delta$z = 0.05. We apply the SBS method in the XMM-LSS SWIRE field and show that it robustly recovers the majority of confirmed optical, MIR, and X-ray-selected clusters at z {\textgreater} 1.0 in that field. Lastly, we present confirmation of SpARCS J022427-032354 at z = 1.63, a new cluster detected with the method and confirmed with 12 high-confidence spectroscopic redshifts obtained using FORS2 on the Very Large Telescope. We conclude with a discussion of future prospects for using the algorithm.},

We investigate the potential physical connection between the growth of dispersion-supported stellar structures (e.g. classical bulges) and the position of galaxies on the star-forming main sequence at {\$}z\backslashsim0{\$}. Combining the might of the SAMI and MaNGA galaxy surveys, we measure the {\$}\backslashlambda{\_}{\{}Re{\}}{\$} spin parameter for 3781 galaxies over {\$}9.5 {\textless} \backslashlog M{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}} [\backslashrm{\{}M{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}] {\textless} 12{\$}. At all stellar masses, galaxies at the locus of the main sequence possess {\$}\backslashlambda{\_}{\{}Re{\}}{\$} values indicative of intrinsically flattened discs. However, above {\$}\backslashlog M{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}[\backslashrm{\{}M{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}]\backslashsim10.5{\$} where the main sequence starts bending, we find tantalising evidence for an increase in the number of galaxies with dispersion-supported structures, perhaps suggesting a connection between bulges and the bending of the main sequence. Moving above the main sequence, we see no evidence of any change in the typical spin parameter in galaxies once gravitationally-interacting systems are excluded from the sample. Similarly, up to 1 dex below the main sequence, {\$}\backslashlambda{\_}{\{}Re{\}}{\$} remains roughly constant and only at very high stellar masses ({\$}\backslashlog M{\_}{\{}\backslashstar{\}}[\backslashrm{\{}M{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}]{\textgreater}11{\$}), do we see a rapid decrease in {\$}\backslashlambda{\_}{\{}Re{\}}{\$} once galaxies decline in star formation activity. If this trend is confirmed, it would be indicative of different quenching mechanisms acting on high- and low-mass galaxies. The results suggest that while a population of galaxies possessing some dispersion-supported structure is already present on the star-forming main sequence, further growth would be required after the galaxy has quenched to match the kinematic properties observed in passive galaxies at {\$}z\backslashsim0{\$}.},

abstract = {The Hubble constant, H 0, or its dimensionless equivalent, little h, is a fundamental cosmological property that is now known to an accuracy better than a few per cent. Despite its cosmological nature, little h commonly appears in the measured properties of individual galaxies. This can pose unique challenges for users of such data, particularly with survey data. In this paper we show how little h arises in the measurement of galaxies, how to compare like-properties from different datasets that have assumed different little h cosmologies, and how to fairly compare theoretical data with observed data, where little h can manifest in vastly different ways. This last point is particularly important when observations are used to calibrate galaxy formation models, as calibrating with the wrong (or no) little h can lead to disastrous results when the model is later converted to the correct h cosmology. We argue that in this modern age little h is an anachronism, being one of least uncertain parameters in astrophysics, and we propose that observers and theorists instead treat this uncertainty like any other. We conclude with a 'cheat sheet' of nine points that should be followed when dealing with little h in data analysis. {\textcopyright} 2013 Astronomical Society of Australia.},

We construct a large, deep (Ks {\textless} 24) sample of 220 000 galaxies selected using the new UltraVISTA DR1 data release. Our analysis is based on precise 30-band photometricredshifts. By comparing these photometric redshifts with 10,800 spectroscopic redshifts from the zCOSMOS bright and faint surveys, we find a precision of $\sigma$$\Delta$z/(1 + z) = 0.008 at i+ {\textless} 22.5 and $\sigma$$\Delta$z/(1 + z) = 0.03 at 1.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 4. We derive the stellar mass function and correct for the Eddington bias. We find a mass-dependent evolution of the global and star-forming populations, with the low-mass end of the mass functions evolving more rapidly than the high-mass end. This mass-dependent evolution is a direct consequence of the star formation being "quenched" in galaxies more massive than M 10 10.7 - 10.9 M. For the mass function of the quiescent galaxies, we do not find any significant evolution of the high-mass end at z {\textless} 1; however we observe a clear flattening of the faint-end slope. From z {\~{}} 3 to z {\~{}} 1, the density of quiescent galaxies increases over the entire mass range. Their comoving stellar mass density increases by 1.6 dex between z {\~{}} 3 and z {\~{}} 1 and by less than 0.2 dex at z {\textless} 1. We infer the star formation history from the mass density evolution. This inferred star formation history is in excellent agreement with instantaneous star formation rate measurements at z {\textless} 1.5, while we find differences of 0.2 dex at z {\textgreater} 1.5 consistent with the expected uncertainties. We also develop a new method to infer the specific star formation rate from the mass function of star-forming galaxies. We find that the specific star formation rate of 1010 - 10.5 M galaxies increases continuously in the redshift range 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 4. Finally, we compare our results with a semi-analytical model and find that these models overestimate the density of low mass quiescent galaxies by an order of magnitude, while the density of low-mass star-forming galaxies is successfully reproduced. {\textcopyright} ESO, 2013.},

Metal-free stars exhibit high effective temperatures and small sizes relative to metal-enriched stars of equal mass. These unique physical characteristics enhance the ionizing photon production by metal-free stars, particularly in the He II (h$\nu${\textgreater}=4 ryd) continuum. The star formation rate of metal-free stars necessary to reionize the hydrogen in the universe by z=5 is consistent with the inferred star formation rate at that epoch. However, the hard stellar spectra are inconsistent with the observations of He II opacity in the intergalactic medium (IGM) at z{\~{}}3, indicating that the period of metal-free star formation ended before that epoch. We examine the effects of these stars on the ionization balance of the IGM, the radiative feedback of the first luminous objects, and the extragalactic radiation field.

A stacked spectrum with an equivalent integration time of {\~{}}500 hours was obtained is publicly released. The spectral and photometric SED properties indicate very weak or absent star formation, moderately old stellar ages of {\~{}}1 Gyr (for solar metallicity) and stellar masses in the range of 10{\^{}}{\{}10-11{\}} solar masses, thus implying that the major star formation and assembly processes for these galaxies occurred at z{\textgreater}2. These galaxies have morphologies that are predominantly compact and spheroidal.However, their sizes (R{\_}e {\textless}{\~{}} 1 kpc) are much smaller than those of spheroids in the present--day Universe. Their stellar mass surface densities are consequently higher by {\~{}}1 dex if compared to spheroids at z{\~{}}0 with the same mass. Their rest-frame B-band surface brightness scales with the effective radius, but the offset with respect to the surface brightness of the local Kormendy relation is too large to be explained by simple passive evolution. At z{\~{}}1, a larger fraction of passive galaxies follows the z{\~{}}0 size -- mass relation. Superdense relics with R{\_}e{\~{}}1 kpc are extremely rare at z{\~{}}0 with respect to z{\textgreater}1, and absent if R{\_}e{\textless}1 kpc. Because of the similar sizes and mass densities, we suggest that the superdense passive galaxies at 1{\textless}z{\textless}2 are the remnants of the powerful starbursts occurring in submillimeter--selected galaxies at z{\textgreater}2. The results are compared with theoretical models and the main implications discussed in the framework of massive galaxy formation and evolution.},

This sample spectroscopically selects galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey that have stopped their primary epoch of star formation within the past {\$}\backslashsim{\$}500 Myrs. Visual classifications are performed on Hyper Suprime Cam (HSC) i-band imaging. We compare to a control sample of mass- and redshift-matched star-forming and quiescent galaxies from the Large Early Galaxy Census and find that post-starburst galaxies are more likely to be classified as disturbed than either category. This corresponds to a factor of {\$}3.6{\^{}}{\{}+2.9{\}}{\_}{\{}-1.3{\}}{\$} times the disturbance rate of older quiescent galaxies and {\$}2.1{\^{}}{\{}+1.9{\}}{\_}{\{}-.73{\}}{\$} times the disturbance rate of star-forming galaxies. Assuming tidal features persist for {\$}\backslashlesssim500{\$} Myr, this suggests merging is coincident with quenching in a significant fraction of these post-starbursts. Galaxies with tidal disturbances are younger on average than undisturbed post-starburst galaxies in our sample, suggesting tidal features from a major merger may have faded over time. This may be exacerbated by the fact that, on average, the undisturbed subset is fainter, rendering low surface brightness tidal features harder to identify. However, the presence of ten young ({\$}\backslashlesssim150{\$} Myr since quenching) undisturbed galaxies suggests that major mergers are not the only fast physical mechanism that shut down the primary epoch of star formation in massive galaxies at intermediate redshift.},

abstract = {We measured stellar velocity dispersions $\sigma$ and derived dynamical masses of nine massive (M ≈ 1011 M ⊙) early-type galaxies (ETGs) from the Galaxy Mass Assembly ultra-deep Spectroscopic Survey (GMASS) sample at redshift 1.4 ≲ z ≲ 2.0. The $\sigma$ are based on individual spectra for two galaxies at z ≈ 1.4 and on a stacked spectrum for seven galaxies with 1.6 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.0, with 202 hr of exposure at the ESO Very Large Telescope. We constructed detailed axisymmetric dynamical models for the objects, based on the Jeans equations, taking the observed surface brightness (from deep HST/ACS observations), point-spread function, and slit effects into account. Our dynamical masses M Jeans agree within ≲30{\%} with virial estimates M vir = 5 × Re$\sigma$2/ G, although the latter tend to be smaller. Our M Jeans also agrees within a factor ≲2 with the M pop previously derived using stellar population models and 11 bands photometry. This confirms that the galaxies are intrinsically massive. The inferred mass-to-light ratios (M/L) U in the very age-sensitive rest-frame U band are consistent with passive evolution in the past 1 Gyr (formation redshift zf ∼3). A "bottom-light" stellar initial mass function appears to be required to ensure close agreement between M Jeans and M pop at z ∼2, as it does at z ∼0. The GMASS ETGs are on average more dense than their local counterpart. However, a few percent of local ETGs of similar dynamical masses also have comparable $\sigma$ and mass surface density $\Sigma$50 inside R e. {\textcopyright} 2009.

We produce an extensive database of dusty model galaxies, calculated starting from the new library of single stellar population (SSPs) models presented in Cassara' et al. 2013 and weighted by a set of 28 different SFHs based on the Schmidt function, and characterized by different ratios of the gas infall time scale {\$}\backslashtau{\_}{\{}infall{\}}{\$} to the star formation efficiency {\$}\backslashnu{\$}. The treatment of dust extinction and re-emission has been carried out by means of the radiative transfer calculation. The spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting technique is performed by using GOSSIP+, a tool able to combine both photometric and spectroscopic information to extract the best value of the physical quantities of interest, and to consider the Intergalactic Medium (IGM) attenuation as a free parameter. We find that the main contribution to the scatter observed in the {\$}SFR-M{\_}{\{}*{\}}{\$} plane is the possibility of choosing between different families of SFHs in the SED fitting procedure, while the redshift range plays a minor role. The majority of the galaxies, at all cosmic times, are best-fit by models with SFHs characterized by a high {\$}\backslashtau{\_}{\{}\backslashrm infall{\}}/\backslashnu{\$} ratio. We discuss the reliability of the presence of a small percentage of dusty and highly star forming galaxies, in the light of their detection in the FIR.},

abstract = {We examine recent evidence from the luminosity-redshift relation of Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) for the {\$}\backslashsim 3 \backslashsigma{\$} detection of a ``Hubble bubble'' -- a departure of the local value of the Hubble constant from its globally averaged value $\backslash$citep{\{}Jha:07{\}}. By comparing the MLCS2k2 fits used in that study to the results from other light-curve fitters applied to the same data, we demonstrate that this is related to the interpretation of SN color excesses (after correction for a light-curve shape-color relation) and the presence of a color gradient across the local sample. If the slope of the linear relation ({\$}\backslashbeta{\$}) between SN color excess and luminosity is fit empirically, then the bubble disappears. If, on the other hand, the color excess arises purely from Milky Way-like dust, then SN data clearly favors a Hubble bubble. We demonstrate that SN data give {\$}\backslashbeta \backslashsimeq 2{\$}, instead of the {\$}\backslashbeta \backslashsimeq 4{\$} one would expect from purely Milky-Way-like dust. This suggests that either SN intrinsic colors are more complicated than can be described with a single light-curve shape parameter, or that dust around SN is unusual. Disentangling these possibilities is both a challenge and an opportunity for large-survey SN Ia cosmology.},

abstract = {The Spitzer Extended Deep Survey (SEDS) is a very deep infrared survey within five well-known extragalactic science fields: the UKIDSS Ultra-Deep Survey, the Extended Chandra Deep Field South, COSMOS, the Hubble Deep Field North, and the Extended Groth Strip. SEDS covers a total area of 1.46 deg 2 to a depth of 26 AB mag (3$\sigma$) in both of the warm Infrared Array Camera (IRAC) bands at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m. Because of its uniform depth of coverage in so many widely-separated fields, SEDS is subject to roughly 25{\%} smaller errors due to cosmic variance than a single-field survey of the same size. SEDS was designed to detect and characterize galaxies from intermediate to high redshifts (z = 2-7) with a built-in means of assessing the impact of cosmic variance on the individual fields. Because the full SEDS depth was accumulated in at least three separate visits to each field, typically with six-month intervals between visits, SEDS also furnishes an opportunity to assess the infrared variability of faint objects. This paper describes the SEDS survey design, processing, and publicly-available data products. Deep IRAC counts for the more than 300,000 galaxies detected by SEDS are consistent with models based on known galaxy populations. Discrete IRAC sources contribute 5.6 ± 1.0 and 4.4 ± 0.8 nW m-2 sr-1 at 3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m to the diffuse cosmic infrared background (CIB). IRAC sources cannot contribute more than half of the total CIB flux estimated from DIRBE data. Barring an unexpected error in the DIRBE flux estimates, half the CIB flux must therefore come from a diffuse component. {\textcopyright} 2013. The American Astronomical Society.

Jupiter's reflected light spectrum in the near-infrared is dominated by its methane opacity including a deep band at 2.3 microns. After the impact, sunlight that would have normally been absorbed by the large amount of methane in Jupiter's atmosphere was instead reflected by the cometary material from the impacts.

abstract = {We present an analysis of star formation and quenching in the SDSS-IV MaNGA-DR15, utilizing over 5 million spaxels from {\~{}}3500 local galaxies. We estimate star formation rate surface densities ($\Sigma$SFR) via dust corrected H$\alpha$ flux where possible, and via an empirical relationship between specific star formation rate (sSFR) and the strength of the 4000 {\AA} break (D4000) in all other cases. We train a multilayered artificial neural network (ANN) and a random forest (RF) to classify spaxels into 'star-forming' and 'quenched' categories given various individual (and groups of) parameters.We find that global parameters (pertaining to the galaxy as a whole) perform collectively the best at predicting when spaxels will be quenched, and are substantially superior to local/spatially resolved and environmental parameters. Central velocity dispersion is the best single parameter for predicting quenching in central galaxies. We interpret this observational fact as a probable consequence of the total integrated energy from active galactic neucleus (AGN) feedback being traced by the mass of the black hole, which is well known to correlate strongly with central velocity dispersion. Additionally, we train both an ANN and RF to estimate $\Sigma$SFR values directly via regression in star-forming regions. Local/spatially resolved parameters are collectively the most predictive at estimating $\Sigma$SFR in these analyses, with stellar mass surface density at the spaxel location ($\Sigma$∗) being by far the best single parameter. Thus, quenching is fundamentally a global process but star formation is governed locally by processes within each spaxel.},

abstract = {The Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) has become a cornerstone of extragalactic astronomy. Since the last public catalog in 2015, a wealth of new imaging and spectroscopic data have been collected in the COSMOS field. This paper describes the collection, processing, and analysis of these new imaging data to produce a new reference photometric redshift catalog. Source detection and multiwavelength photometry are performed for 1.7 million sources across the 2 deg 2 of the COSMOS field, ∼966,000 of which are measured with all available broadband data using both traditional aperture photometric methods and a new profile-fitting photometric extraction tool, The Farmer , which we have developed. A detailed comparison of the two resulting photometric catalogs is presented. Photometric redshifts are computed for all sources in each catalog utilizing two independent photometric redshift codes. Finally, a comparison is made between the performance of the photometric methodologies and of the redshift codes to demonstrate an exceptional degree of self-consistency in the resulting photometric redshifts. The i {\textless} 21 sources have subpercent photometric redshift accuracy and even the faintest sources at 25 {\textless} i {\textless} 27 reach a precision of 5{\%}. Finally, these results are discussed in the context of previous, current, and future surveys in the COSMOS field. Compared to COSMOS2015, it reaches the same photometric redshift precision at almost one magnitude deeper. Both photometric catalogs and their photometric redshift solutions and physical parameters will be made available through the usual astronomical archive systems (ESO Phase 3, IPAC-IRSA, and CDS).},

The sources are selected from HST/ACS+WFC3/IR data over the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF), two HUDF parallel fields, and wide area data over the CANDELS/GOODS-South. The new Spitzer/IRAC data increase the coverage in [3.6] and [4.5] to {\~{}}120h over the HUDF reaching depths of {\~{}}28 (AB,1$\sigma$). The improved depth and inclusion of brighter candidates result in direct {\textgreater}=3$\sigma$ InfraRed Array Camera (IRAC) detections of 20/63 sources, of which 11/63 are detected at {\textgreater}=5$\sigma$. The average [3.6]-[4.5] colors of IRAC detected galaxies at z {\~{}} 8 are markedly redder than those at z {\~{}} 7, observed only 130 Myr later. The simplest explanation is that we witness strong rest-frame optical emission lines (in particular [O III] $\lambda$$\lambda$4959, 5007 + H$\beta$) moving through the IRAC bandpasses with redshift. Assuming that the average rest-frame spectrum is the same at both z {\~{}} 7 and z {\~{}} 8 we estimate a rest-frame equivalent width of {\{}W{\}}{\_}{\{}[O$\backslash$,$\backslash$scriptsize{\{}III{\}}]$\backslash$ $\backslash$lambda $\backslash$lambda 4959,5007+H$\backslash$beta {\}}=670{\^{}}{\{}+260{\}}{\_}{\{}-170{\}} {\AA} contributing 0.56{\^{}}{\{}+0.16{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.11{\}} mag to the [4.5] filter at z {\~{}} 8.

Considering four separate redshift bins with {\{}{\$}\Delta{\$}{\}}z = 0.5, we construct three galaxy populations, i.e., red sequence (RS), blue cloud (BC), and green valley (GV) galaxies, according to their rest-frame extinction-corrected UV colors. The correlation lengths of these populations are confirmed to be dependent on their rest-frame UV color and redshift: UV redder galaxies are found to be more clustered. In all redshift bins, the GV galaxies generally have medium clustering amplitudes and are hosted within dark matter halos whose masses are more or less between those of RS and BC galaxies; and the clustering amplitude of GV galaxies is close to that of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) in the same redshift bin, suggesting that AGN activity may be responsible for transforming galaxy colors. After carefully examining their stellar masses, we find that the clustering amplitudes of galaxy samples with different colors are all similar once they have a similar median stellar mass and that the median stellar mass alone may be a good predictor of galaxy clustering.},

abstract = {We investigate the velocity vs. position phase space of z {\~{}} 1 cluster galaxies using a set of 424 spectroscopic redshifts in 9 clusters drawn from the GCLASS survey. Dividing the galaxy population into three categories: quiescent, star-forming, and poststarburst, we find that these populations have distinct distributions in phase space. Most striking are the poststarburst galaxies, which are commonly found at small clustercentric radii with high clustercentric velocities, and appear to trace a coherent ``ring" in phase space. Using several zoom simulations of clusters we show that the coherent distribution of the poststarbursts can be reasonably well-reproduced using a simple quenching scenario. Specifically, the phase space is best reproduced if satellite quenching occurs on a rapid timescale (0.1 {\textless} tau{\_}{\{}Q{\}} {\textless} 0.5 Gyr) after galaxies make their first passage of R {\~{}} 0.5R{\_}{\{}200{\}}, a process that takes a total time of {\~{}} 1 Gyr after first infall. We compare this quenching timescale to the timescale implied by the stellar populations of the poststarburst galaxies and find that the poststarburst spectra are well-fit by a rapid quenching (tau{\_}{\{}Q{\}} = 0.4{\^{}}{\{}+0.3{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.4{\}} Gyr) of a typical star-forming galaxy. The similarity between the quenching timescales derived from these independent indicators is a strong consistency check of the quenching model. Given that the model implies satellite quenching is rapid, and occurs well within R{\_}{\{}200{\}}, this would suggest that ram-pressure stripping of either the hot or cold gas component of galaxies are the most plausible candidates for the physical mechanism. The high cold gas consumption rates at z {\~{}} 1 make it difficult to determine if hot or cold gas stripping is dominant; however, measurements of the redshift evolution of the satellite quenching timescale and location may be capable of distinguishing between the two.},

abstract = {The Great Observatories All-sky LIRG Survey (GOALS) consists of a complete sample of 202 Luminous Infrared Galaxies (LIRGs) selected from the IRAS Revised Bright Galaxy Sample (RBGS). The galaxies span the full range of interaction stages, from isolated galaxies to interacting pairs to late stage mergers. We present a comparison of the UV and infrared properties of 135 galaxies in GOALS observed by GALEX and Spitzer. For interacting galaxies with separations greater than the resolution of GALEX and Spitzer (2-6"), we assess the UV and IR properties of each galaxy individually. The contribution of the FUV to the measured SFR ranges from 0.2{\%} to 17.9{\%}, with a median of 2.8{\%} and a mean of 4.0 +/- 0.4{\%}. The specific star formation rate of the GOALS sample is extremely high, with a median value (3.9*10{\^{}}{\{}-10{\}} yr{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}) that is comparable to the highest specific star formation rates seen in the Spitzer Infrared Nearby Galaxies Survey sample. We examine the position of each galaxy on the IR excess-UV slope (IRX-beta) diagram as a function of galaxy properties, including IR luminosity and interaction stage. The LIRGs on average have greater IR excesses than would be expected based on their UV colors if they obeyed the same relations as starbursts with L{\_}IR {\textless} 10{\^{}}{\{}11{\}}L{\_}0 or normal late-type galaxies. The ratio of L{\_}IR to the value one would estimate from the IRXg-beta relation published for lower luminosity starburst galaxies ranges from 0.2 to 68, with a median value of 2.7. A minimum of 19{\%} of the total IR luminosity in the RBGS is produced in LIRGs and ULIRGs with red UV colors (beta {\textgreater} 0). Among resolved interacting systems, 32{\%} contain one galaxy which dominates the IR emission while the companion dominates the UV emission. Only 21{\%} of the resolved systems contain a single galaxy which dominates both wavelengths.},

abstract = {Recently a number of studies have found a similarity between the passive fraction of central and satellite galaxies when controlled for both stellar and halo mass. These results suggest that the quenching processes that affect galaxies are largely agnostic to central/satellite status, which contradicts the traditional picture of increased satellite quenching via environmental processes such as stripping, strangulation and starvation. Here we explore this further using the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey which extends to {\~{}}2dex lower in stellar mass than SDSS, is more complete for closely-separated galaxies ({\textgreater}95{\%} compared to {\textgreater}70{\%}), and identifies lower-halo-mass groups outside of the very local Universe (M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashmathrm{\{}halo{\}}{\}}\backslashsim10{\^{}}{\{}12{\}}{\$}M{\$}{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} at {\$}0.1{\textless}z{\textless}0.2{\$}). As far as possible we aim to replicate the selections, completeness corrections and central/satellite division of one of the previous studies but find clear differences between passive fractions of centrals and satellites. We also find that our passive fractions increase with both halo-to-satellite mass ratio and central-to-second rank mass ratio. This suggests that quenching is more efficient in satellites that are low-mass for their halo ({\$}i.e{\$} at high halo-to-satellite mass ratio in comparison to low halo-to-satellite mass ratio) and are more likely to be passive in older groups - forming a consistent picture of environmental quenching of satellites. We then discuss potential explanations for the previously observed similarity, such as dependence on the group-finding method.},

abstract = { The discovery in deep near-infrared surveys of a population of massive quiescent galaxies at z {\textgreater} 3 has given rise to the question of how they came to be quenched so early in the history of the universe. Measuring their molecular gas properties can distinguish between physical processes where they stop forming stars due to a lack of fuel versus those where the star formation efficiency is reduced and the gas is retained. We conducted Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array observations of four quiescent galaxies at z = 3.5–4.0 found by the Fourstar Galaxy Evolution Survey and a serendipitous optically dark galaxy at z = 3.71. We aim to investigate the presence of dust-obscured star formation and their gas content by observing the dust continuum emission at Band 7 and the atomic carbon [C i ]( 3 P 1 – 3 P 0 ) line at 492.16 GHz. Among the four quiescent galaxies, only one source is detected in the dust continuum at $\lambda$ obs = 870 $\mu$ m. The submillimeter observations confirm their passive nature, and all of them are located more than four times below the main sequence of star-forming galaxies at z = 3.7. None of the targets are detected in [C i ], constraining their gas-mass fractions to be {\textless}20{\%}. These gas-mass fractions are more than 3 times lower than the scaling relation for star-forming galaxies at z = 3.7. These results support scenarios where massive galaxies at z = 3.5–4.0 quench by consuming/expelling all the gas rather than by reducing the efficiency of the conversion of their gas into stars. },

VIDEO is a ˜12 deg2 survey in the near-infrared Z, Y, J, H and Ks bands, specifically designed to enable the evolution of galaxies and large structures to be traced as a function of both epoch and environment from the present day out to z = 4, and active galactic nuclei (AGNs) and the most massive galaxies up to and into the epoch of reionization. With its depth and area, VIDEO will be able to fully explore the period in the Universe where AGN and starburst activity were at their peak and the first galaxy clusters were beginning to virialize. VIDEO therefore offers a unique data set with which to investigate the interplay between AGN, starbursts and environment, and the role of feedback at a time when it was potentially most crucial. We provide data over the VIDEO-XMM3 tile, which also covers the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey Deep-1 field (CFHTLS-D1). The released VIDEO data reach a 5$\sigma$ AB-magnitude depth of Z = 25.7, Y = 24.5, J = 24.4, H = 24.1 and Ks = 23.8 in 2 arcsec diameter apertures (the full depth of Y = 24.6 will be reached within the full integration time in future releases). The data are compared to previous surveys over this field and we find good astrometric agreement with the Two Micron All Sky Survey, and source counts in agreement with the recently released UltraVISTA survey data. The addition of the VIDEO data to the CFHTLS-D1 optical data increases the accuracy of photometric redshifts and significantly reduces the fraction of catastrophic outliers over the redshift range 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1 from 5.8 to 3.1 per cent in the absence of an i-band luminosity prior. However, we expect that the main improvement in photometric redshifts will come in the redshift range 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 4 due to the sensitivity to the Balmer and 4000 {\AA} breaks provided by the near-infrared VISTA filters. All images and catalogues presented in this paper are publicly available through ESO's phase 3 archive and the VISTA Science Archive.},

abstract = {We present synthetic spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for single-age, single-metallicity stellar populations (SSPs) covering the full optical spectral range at moderately high resolution [full width at half-maximum (FWHM) = 2.3 {\AA}]. These SEDs constitute our base models, as they combine scaled-solar isochrones with an empirical stellar spectral library [Medium resolution INT Library of Empirical Spectra (MILES)], which follows the chemical evolution pattern of the solar neighbourhood. The models rely as much as possible on empirical ingredients, not just on the stellar spectra, but also on extensive photometric libraries, which are used to determine the transformations from the theoretical parameters of the isochrones to observational quantities. The unprecedented stellar parameter coverage of the MILES stellar library allowed us to safely extend our optical SSP SED predictions from intermediate- to very-old-age regimes and the metallicity coverage of the SSPs from super-solar to [M/H] = -2.3. SSPs with such low metallicities are particularly useful for globular cluster studies. We have computed SSP SEDs for a suite of initial mass function shapes and slopes. We provide a quantitative analysis of the dependence of the synthesized SSP SEDs on the (in)complete coverage of the stellar parameter space in the input library that not only shows that our models are of higher quality than those of other works, but also in which range of SSP parameters our models are reliable. The SSP SEDs are a useful tool to perform the analysis of stellar populations in a very flexible manner. Observed spectra can be studied by means of full spectrum fitting or by using line indices. For the latter, we propose a new line index system to avoid the intrinsic uncertainties associated with the popular Lick/IDS system and provide more appropriate, uniform, spectral resolution. Apart from constant resolution as a function of wavelength, the system is also based on flux-calibrated spectra. Data can be analysed at three different resolutions: 5, 8.4 and 14 {\AA} (FWHM), which are appropriate for studying globular cluster, low- and intermediate-mass galaxies, and massive galaxies, respectively. Furthermore, we provide polynomials to transform current Lick/IDS line index measurements to the new system. We provide line index tables in the new system for various popular samples of Galactic globular clusters and galaxies. We apply the models to various stellar clusters and galaxies with high-quality spectra, for which independent studies are available, obtaining excellent results. Finally, we designed a web page from which not only these models and stellar libraries can be downloaded but which also provides a suite of on-line tools to facilitate the handling and transformation of the spectra. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

The technique involved using the 3-D colour plane i-z:z-W1:W1-W2 with the WISE W1 (3.4 micron) and W2 (4.5 micron) bands taking the place of the usual NIR J band to help decrease stellar dwarf contamination. Here we report on our continued search for 5.7{\textless}z{\textless}6.4 quasars over an {\~{}}2x larger area of {\~{}}3577 sq. deg. of the Southern Hemisphere.

J158.6938-14.4211 was confirmed by Keck LRIS observations and J332.8017-32.1036 was confirmed by ESO NTT EFOSC-2 observations. Here we present VLT X-shooter Visible and NIR spectra for the four ATLAS quasars. We have further independently rediscovered two z{\textgreater}5.7 quasars previously found by the VIKING/KiDS and PanSTARRS surveys. This means that in ATLAS we have now discovered a total of six quasars in our target 5.7{\textless}z{\textless}6.4 redshift range. Making approximate corrections for incompleteness, we find that our quasar space density agrees with the SDSS results of Jiang et al. at M{\_}1450A{\~{}}-27mag.

abstract = {We measure spectral features of ∼3500 K-selected galaxies at 0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.0 from high-quality medium-band photometry using a new technique. First, we divide the galaxy sample in 32 subsamples based on the similarities between the full spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the galaxies. For each of these 32 galaxy types we construct a composite SED by de-redshifting and scaling the observed photometry. This approach increases the signal-to-noise ratio and sampling of galaxy SEDs and allows for model-independent stellar population studies. The composite SEDs are of spectroscopic quality and facilitate - for the first time - H$\alpha$ measurements for a large magnitude-limited sample of distant galaxies. The line widths indicate a photometric redshift uncertainty of $\Delta$z {\textless} 0.02 × (1 + z). The composite SEDs also show the Balmer and 4000 breaks, MgII absorption at ∼2800 {\AA}, the dust absorption feature at 2175 {\AA}, and blended [OIII]+H$\beta$ emission. We compare the total equivalent width of H$\alpha$, [NII], and [SII] (WH$\alpha$+) with the strength of the 4000 {\AA} break (D(4000)) and the best-fit specific star formation rate, and find that all these properties are strongly correlated. This is a reassuring result, as currently most distant stellar population studies are based on just continuum emission. Furthermore, the relation between W H$\alpha$+ and D(4000) provides interesting clues to the star formation histories of galaxies, as these features are sensitive to different stellar ages. We find that the correlation between WH$\alpha$+ and D(4000) at 0.5 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.0 is similar to z ∼ 0 and that the suppression of star formation in galaxies at z {\textless} 2 is generally not abrupt, but a gradual process. {\textcopyright} 2011.

abstract = {Optically-compact star-forming galaxies (SFGs) have been proposed as immediate progenitors of quiescent galaxies, although their origin and nature are debated. Were they formed in slow secular processes or in rapid merger-driven starbursts? Addressing this question would provide fundamental insight into how quenching occurs. We explore the location of the general population of galaxies with respect to fundamental star-forming and structural relations, identify compact SFGs based on their stellar core densities, and study three diagnostics of the burstiness of star formation: 1) Star formation efficiency, 2) interstellar medium (ISM), and 3) radio emission. The overall distribution of galaxies in the fundamental relations points towards a smooth transition towards quiescence while galaxies grow their stellar cores, although some galaxies suddenly increase their specific star-formation rate when they become compact. From their star formation efficiencies compact and extended SFGs appear similar. In relation to the ISM diagnostic, by studying the CO excitation, the density of the neutral gas, and the strength of the ultraviolet radiation field, compact SFGs resemble galaxies located in the upper envelope of the SFGs main sequence, although yet based on a small sample size. Regarding the radio emission diagnostic we find that galaxies become increasingly compact as the starburst ages, implying that at least some compact SFGs are old starbursts. We suggest that compact SFGs could be starburts winding down and eventually crossing the main sequence towards quiescence.},

These galaxies have gas-phase metallicity and star-formation rate measurements from Hb, [OIII], Ha, and [NII]. Using stacks of Spitzer, Herschel, and ALMA photometry (rest-frame {\~{}} 8-400{\$}\backslashmu{\$}m), we examine the IR SED of high-redshift subsolar metallicity ({\~{}}0.5 {\$}Z{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}) LIRGs. We find that the data agree well with an average SED template of higher luminosity local low-metallicity dwarf galaxies (reduced {\$}\backslashchi{\^{}}2{\$} of 1.8). When compared with the commonly used templates for solar-metallicity local galaxies or high-redshift LIRGs and ULIRGs, even in the most favorable case (with reduced {\$}\backslashchi{\^{}}2{\$} of 2.8), the templates are rejected at {\textgreater}98{\%} confidence level. The broader and hotter IR SED of both the local dwarfs and high-redshift subsolar metallicity galaxies may result from different grain properties, a clumpy dust geometry, or a harder/more intense ionizing radiation field that heats the dust to higher temperatures. The obscured SFR indicated by the FIR emission of the subsolar metallicity galaxies is only {\~{}} 60{\%} of the total SFR, which is considerably lower than that of the local LIRGs with {\~{}} 96-97{\%} obscured fractions. Due to the evolving IR SED shape, the local LIRG templates fit to mid-IR data can overestimate the Rayleigh-Jeans tail measurements at z{\~{}}2 by a factor of 2-20, and these templates underestimate IR luminosities if fit to the observed ALMA fluxes by {\textgreater}0.4dex. At a given stellar mass or metallicity, dust masses at z{\~{}}2.3 are an order of magnitude higher than those at z{\~{}}0. Given the predicted molecular gas mass fractions, the observed z{\~{}}2.3 dust-to-stellar mass ratios suggest lower dust-to-molecular gas masses than in local galaxies at the same metallicity.},

Our continuum data (rest-frame 110{\$}\backslashrm \backslashmu m{\$}, close to the peak of infrared emission) allows us to constrain luminosity weighted dust temperatures and total infrared luminosities. With data at longer wavelengths, we measure for the first time the emissivity index at these redshifts to provide more robust estimates of molecular gas masses based on dust continuum. The Band 8 observations of three out of four galaxies can only be reconciled with optically thin emission redward of rest-frame 100{\$}\backslashrm \backslashmu m{\$}. The derived dust peak temperatures at z {\~{}} 5.5 (38{\$}\backslashpm{\$}8K) are elevated compared to average local galaxies, however, 5-10K below what would be predicted from an extrapolation of the trend at {\$}z{\textless}4{\$}. This behaviour can be explained by decreasing dust abundance (or density) towards high redshifts, which would cause the infrared SED at the peak to be more optically thin, making hot dust more visible to the external observer.

To first order, the abundance patterns of the {\$}z\backslashsim0.7{\$} quiescent galaxies are strikingly similar to those at {\$}z\backslashsim0{\$}. However, at the lowest velocity dispersions the {\$}z\backslashsim0.7{\$} galaxies have slightly enhanced N, Mg, Ti, and Ni abundance ratios and earlier formation redshifts than their {\$}z\backslashsim0{\$} counterparts.

Finally, the abundance patterns of both {\$}z\backslashsim0{\$} and {\$}z\backslashsim0.7{\$} quiescent galaxies differ considerably from theoretical prediction based on a chemical evolution model, indicating that our understanding of the enrichment histories of these galaxies is still very limited.},

abstract = {The Milky Way (MW) offers a uniquely detailed view of galactic structure and is often regarded as a prototypical spiral galaxy. But recent observations indicate that the MW is atypical: it has an undersized supermassive black hole at its centre; it is surrounded by a very low mass, excessively metal-poor stellar halo; and it has an unusually large nearby satellite galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Here we show that the LMC is on a collision course with the MW with which it will merge in {\$}2.4{\^{}}{\{}+1.2{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.8{\}}{\$} Gyrs (68{\%} confidence level). This catastrophic and long-overdue event will restore the MW to normality. Using the EAGLE galaxy formation simulation, we show that, as a result of the merger, the central supermassive black hole will increase in mass by up to a factor of 8. The Galactic stellar halo will undergo an equally impressive transformation, becoming 5 times more massive. The additional stars will come predominantly from the disrupted LMC, but a sizeable number will be ejected onto the halo from the stellar disc. The post-merger stellar halo will have the median metallicity of the LMC, [Fe/H]=-0.5 dex, which is typical of other galaxies of similar mass to the MW. At the end of this exceptional event, the MW will become a true benchmark for spiral galaxies, at least temporarily.},

abstract = {We use deep Chandra X-ray imaging to measure the distribution of specific black hole accretion rates (LX relative to the stellarmass of the galaxy) and thus trace active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity within star-forming and quiescent galaxies, as a function of stellar mass (from 108.5 to 1011.5M⊙) and redshift (to z {\~{}} 4). We adopt near-infrared-selected samples of galaxies from the CANDELS and UltraVISTA surveys, extract X-ray data for every galaxy, and use a flexible Bayesian method to combine these data and to measure the probability distribution function of specific black hole accretion rates, $\lambda$sBHAR. We identify a broad distribution of $\lambda$sBHAR in both star-forming and quiescent galaxies - likely reflecting the stochastic nature of AGN fuelling - with a roughly power-law shape that rises towards lower $\lambda$sBHAR, a steep cut-offat $\lambda$sBHAR ≳ 0.1-1 (in Eddington equivalent units), and a turnover or flattening at $\lambda$sBHAR ≲ 10-3 to 10-2. We find that the probability of a star-forming galaxy hosting a moderate $\lambda$sBHAR AGN depends on stellar mass and evolves with redshift, shifting towards higher $\lambda$sBHAR at higher redshifts. This evolution is truncated at a point corresponding to the Eddington limit, indicating black holes may self-regulate their growth at high redshifts when copious gas is available. The probability of a quiescent galaxy hosting an AGN is generally lower than that of a starforming galaxy, shows signs of suppression at the highest stellar masses and evolves strongly with redshift. The AGN duty cycle in high-redshift (z ≳ 2) quiescent galaxies thus reaches {\~{}}20 per cent, comparable to the duty cycle in star-forming galaxies of equivalent stellar mass and redshift.},

abstract = {The reionization of the Universe is one of the most important topics of present day astrophysical research. The most plausible candidates for the reionization process are star-forming galaxies, which according to the predictions of the majority of the theoretical and semi-analytical models should dominate the HI ionizing background at z{\~{}}3. We aim at measuring the Lyman continuum escape fraction, which is one of the key parameters to compute the contribution of star-forming galaxies to the UV background. We have used ultra-deep U-band imaging (U=30.2mag at 1sigma) by LBC/LBT in the CANDELS/GOODS-North field, as well as deep imaging in COSMOS and EGS fields, in order to estimate the Lyman continuum escape fraction of 69 star-forming galaxies with secure spectroscopic redshifts at 3.27{\textless}z{\textless}3.40 to faint magnitude limits (L=0.2L*, or equivalently M1500{\~{}}-19). We have measured through stacks a stringent upper limit ({\textless}1.7{\%} at 1sigma) for the relative escape fraction of HI ionizing photons from bright galaxies (L{\textgreater}L*), while for the faint population (L=0.2L*) the limit to the escape fraction is {\~{}}10{\%}. We have computed the contribution of star-forming galaxies to the observed UV background at z{\~{}}3 and we have found that it is not enough to keep the Universe ionized at these redshifts, unless their escape fraction increases significantly ({\textgreater}10{\%}) at low luminosities (M1500{\textgreater}-19). We compare our results on the Lyman continuum escape fraction of high-z galaxies with recent estimates in the literature and discuss future prospects to shed light on the end of the Dark Ages. In the future, strong gravitational lensing will be fundamental to measure the Lyman continuum escape fraction down to faint magnitudes (M1500{\~{}}-16) which are inaccessible with the present instrumentation on blank fields.},

abstract = {Context. The advent of deep, multi-wavelength surveys, together with the availability of extensive numerical simulations, now allow us for the systematic search and study of (proto)clusters and their surrounding environment as a function of redshift. Aims. We aim to define the environment and to identify overdensities in the VANDELS Chandra Deep Field-South (CDFS) and UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey (UDS) fields. We want to investigate whether we can use Ly$\alpha$ emission to obtain additional information of the environment properties and whether Ly$\alpha$ emitters show different characteristics as a function of their environment. Methods. We estimated local densities using a three-dimensional algorithm which works in the RA-dec-redshift space. We took advantage of the physical parameters of all the sources in the VANDELS fields to study their properties as a function of environment. In particular, we focused on the rest-frame U − V color to evaluate the stage of evolution of the galaxies located in the overdensities and in the field. Then we selected a sample of 131 Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies (EW(Ly$\alpha$) {\textgreater} 0{\AA}), unbiased with respect to environmental density, from the first two seasons of the VANDELS survey to study their location with respect to the over-or under-dense environment and infer whether they are useful tracers of overdense regions. Results. We identify 13 (proto)cluster candidates in the CDFS and nine in the UDS at 2 {\textless} z {\textless} 4, based on photometric and spectroscopic redshifts from VANDELS and from all the available literature. No significant difference is observed in the rest-frame U− V color between field and galaxies located within the identified overdensities, but the star-forming galaxies in overdense regions tend to be more massive and to have low specific SFRs than in the field. We study the distribution of the VANDELS Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEVs) and we find that Ly$\alpha$ emitters lie preferentially outside of overdense regions as the majority of the galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts from VANDELS. The LAEVs in overdense regions tend to have low Ly$\alpha$ equivalent widths and low specific SFRs, and they also tend to be more massive than the LAEVs in the field. Their stacked Ly$\alpha$ profile shows a dominant red peak and a hint of a blue peak. There is evidence that their Ly$\alpha$ emission is more extended and offset with respect to the UV continuum. Conclusions. LAEVs are likely to be influenced by the environment. In fact, our results favour a scenario that implies outflows of low expansion velocities and high HI column densities for galaxies in overdense regions. An outflow with low expansion velocity could be related to the way galaxies are forming stars in overdense regions; the high HI column density can be a consequence of the gravitational potential of the overdensity. Therefore, Ly$\alpha$-emitting galaxies can provide useful insights on the environment in which they reside.},

abstract = {{\$}JWST{\$}'s first glimpse of the {\$}z{\textgreater}10{\$} Universe has yielded a surprising abundance of luminous galaxy candidates. Here we present the most extreme of these systems: CEERS-1749. Based on {\$}0.6-5\backslashmu{\$}m photometry, this strikingly luminous ({\$}\backslashapprox{\$}26 mag) galaxy appears to lie at {\$}z\backslashapprox17{\$}. This would make it an {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}UV{\}}{\}}\backslashapprox-22{\$}, {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}\backslashstar{\}}{\}}\backslashapprox5\backslashtimes10{\^{}}{\{}9{\}}M{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\}}{\$} system that formed a mere {\$}\backslashsim220{\$} Myrs after the Big Bang. The implied number density of this galaxy and its analogues challenges virtually every early galaxy evolution model that assumes {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}CDM cosmology. However, there is strong environmental evidence supporting a secondary redshift solution of {\$}z\backslashapprox5{\$}: all three of the galaxy's nearest neighbors at {\$}{\textless}2.5{\$}" have photometric redshifts of {\$}z\backslashapprox5{\$}. Further, we show that CEERS-1749 may lie in a {\$}z\backslashapprox5{\$} protocluster that is {\$}\backslashgtrsim5\backslashtimes{\$} overdense compared to the field. Intense line emission at {\$}z\backslashapprox5{\$} from a quiescent galaxy harboring ionized gas, or from a dusty starburst, may provide satisfactory explanations for CEERS-1749's photometry. The emission lines at {\$}z\backslashapprox5{\$} conspire to boost the {\$}{\textgreater}2\backslashmu{\$}m photometry, producing an apparent blue slope as well as a strong break in the SED. Such a perfectly disguised contaminant is possible only in a narrow redshift window ({\$}\backslashDelta z\backslashlesssim0.1{\$}), implying that the permitted volume for such interlopers may not be a major concern for {\$}z{\textgreater}10{\$} searches, particularly when medium-bands are deployed. If CEERS-1749 is confirmed to lie at {\$}z\backslashapprox5{\$}, it will be the highest-redshift quiescent galaxy, or one of the lowest mass dusty galaxies of the early Universe detected to-date. Both redshift solutions of this intriguing galaxy hold the potential to challenge existing models of early galaxy evolution, making spectroscopic follow-up of this source critical.},

abstract = {We present an overview of a new integral field spectroscopic survey called MaNGA (Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory), one of three core programs in the fourth-generation Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-IV) that began on 2014 July 1. MaNGA will investigate the internal kinematic structure and composition of gas and stars in an unprecedented sample of 10,000 nearby galaxies. We summarize essential characteristics of the instrument and survey design in the context of MaNGA's key science goals and present prototype observations to demonstrate MaNGA's scientific potential. MaNGA employs dithered observations with 17 fiber-bundle integral field units that vary in diameter from 12″ (19 fibers) to 32″ (127 fibers). Two dual-channel spectrographs provide simultaneous wavelength coverage over 3600-10300 A˚ at R ∼ 2000.With a typical integration time of 3 hr, MaNGA reaches a target r-band signal-to-noise ratio of 4-8 (A˚-1 per 2″ fiber) at 23 AB mag arcsec-2, which is typical for the outskirts of MaNGA galaxies. Targets are selected with M∗ ≳ 109 M⊙ using SDSS-I redshifts and i-band luminosity to achieve uniform radial coverage in terms of the effective radius, an approximately flat distribution in stellar mass, and a sample spanning a wide range of environments. Analysis of our prototype observations demonstrates MaNGA's ability to probe gas ionization, shed light on recent star formation and quenching, enable dynamical modeling, decompose constituent components, and map the composition of stellar populations.MaNGA's spatially resolved spectra will enable an unprecedented study of the astrophysics of nearby galaxies in the coming 6 yr.},

However, no evidence of this transition has been found in many high redshift galaxy surveys including CFHTLS, CANDELS and SPLASH, the first studies to probe the high-mass end at these redshifts.

Based on the color parameter DeltaC12 and the decline rate Deltam15, we found that the average absorption-to-reddening ratios for SN Ia host galaxies are R{\_}UBVI = 4.37 pm 0.25, 3.33 pm 0.11, 2.30 pm 0.11, and 1.18 pm 0.11, which are systematically lower than the standard values in the Galaxy. We investigated the correlations of the intrinsic luminosity with light-curve decline rate, color index, and SN environmental parameters. In particular, we found that SNe Ia in E/S0 galaxies close to the central region are brighter than those in the outer region, which may suggest a possible metallicity effect on SN luminosity. The dependence of SN luminosity on galactic environment disappears after corrections for the extinction and DeltaC12. The Hubble diagrams constructed using 73 Hubble flow SNe Ia yield a 1 sigma scatter of le 0.12mag in BVI bands and le 0.16 mag in U band. The luminosity difference between normal SNe Ia and peculiar objects (including SN 1991bg–like and SN 1991T–like events) has now been reduced to within 0.15 mag via DeltaC12 correction.We use the same precepts to correct the nearby SNe Ia with Cepheid distances and found that the fully corrected absolute magnitudes of SNe Ia are M{\_}B = -19.33 pm 0.06 and M{\_}V = -19.27 pm 0.05.

The gas-phase oxygen abundance, ionization parameter, and electron density of ionized gas are derived from rest-frame optical strong emission lines measured on near-infrared spectra obtained with Keck/MOSFIRE. We remove the effect of these strong emission lines in the broad-band fluxes to compute stellar masses via spectral energy distribution fitting, while the SFR is derived from the dust-corrected ultraviolet luminosity. The ionization parameter is weakly correlated with the specific SFR, but otherwise the ionization parameter and electron density do not correlate with other global galaxy properties such as stellar mass, SFR, and metallicity. The mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at {\$}z\backslashsimeq3.3{\$} shows lower metallicity by {\$}\backslashsimeq 0.7{\$} dex than that at {\$}z=0{\$} at the same stellar mass. Our sample shows an offset by {\$}\backslashsimeq 0.3{\$} dex from the locally defined mass-metallicity-SFR relation, indicating that simply extrapolating such relation to higher redshift may predict an incorrect evolution of MZR. Furthermore, within the uncertainties we find no SFR-metallicity correlation, suggesting a less important role of SFR in controlling the metallicity at high redshift. We finally investigate the redshift evolution of the MZR by using the model by Lilly et al. (2013), finding that the observed evolution from {\$}z=0{\$} to {\$}z\backslashsimeq3.3{\$} can be accounted for by the model assuming a weak redshift evolution of the star formation efficiency.},

abstract = {Quasar outflows may play important role in the evolution of its host galaxy and central black hole, and are most often studied in absorption lines. In this paper, we present a detailed study of multiple outflows in the obscured ultraluminous infrared quasar Q1321+058. The outflows reveal themselves in the complex optical and ultraviolet (UV) emission-line spectrum, with a broad component blueshifted by 1650 km s-1 and a narrow component by 360 km s-1, respectively. The higher velocity component shows ever strong N III] (N III]/C III] = 3.8 0.3 and N III]/C IV = 0.53) and strong Si III] (Si III]/C III] ≃ 1), in addition to strong [O III]$\lambda$5007 and [Ne III]$\lambda$3869 emission. A comparison of these line ratios with photoionization models suggests an overabundance of N and Si relative to C. The abundance pattern is consistent with a fast chemical enriching process associated with a recent starburst, triggered by a recent galaxy merger. The outflow extends to several tens to hundred parsecs from the quasar, and covers only a very small sky. We find that the outflow with line emitting gas is energetically insufficient to remove the interstellar medium of the host galaxy, but total kinetic energy may be much larger than suggested by the emission lines. The velocity range and the column density suggest that the outflow might be part of the low-ionization broad absorption line region as seen in a small class of quasars. The optical and UV continuum is starlight dominated and can be modeled with a young-aged (1 Myr) plus an intermediate-aged (∼ 0.5-1 Gyr) stellar populations, suggesting a fast building of the stellar mass in the host galaxy, consistent with the starburst-type metal abundances inferred from the high-velocity outflow spectrum. The broadband spectral energy distribution shows that it is an obscured quasar with its bulk emission in the middle infrared.

abstract = {We present continuous, monochromatic star formation rate (SFR) indicators over the mid-infrared wavelength range of 6-70 micron. We use a sample of 58 star forming galaxies (SFGs) in the Spitzer-SDSS-GALEX Spectroscopic Survey (SSGSS) at z{\textless}0.2, for which there is a rich suite of multi-wavelength photometry and spectroscopy from the ultraviolet through to the infrared. The data from the Spitzer infrared spectrograph (IRS) of these galaxies, which spans 5-40 micron, is anchored to their photometric counterparts. The spectral region between 40-70 micron is interpolated using dust model fits to the IRS spectrum and Spitzer 70 and 160 micron photometry. Since there are no sharp spectral features in this region, we expect these interpolations to be robust. This spectral range is calibrated as a SFR diagnostic using several reference SFR indicators to mitigate potential bias. Our band-specific continuous SFR indicators are found to be consistent with monochromatic calibrations in the local universe, as derived from Spitzer, WISE, and Herschel photometry. Our local composite template and continuous SFR diagnostics are made available for public use through the NASA/IPAC Infrared Science Archive (IRSA) and have typical dispersions of 30{\%} or less. We discuss the validity and range of applicability for our SFR indicators in the context of unveiling the formation and evolution of galaxies. Additionally, in the era of the James Webb Space Telescope this will become a flexible tool, applicable to any SFG up to z{\~{}}3.},

However, in general, the brightest UV sources are clearly displaced from the {\$}I{\$}-band and near-IR peaks by at least hundreds of pc. Further, only 0.07{\%}-7.3{\%} of the total near-UV light is projected within the inner 500 pc radius, even though this is the same region wherein most of the bolometric energy is generated. All nuclei are highly obscured by dust. (Abridged)},

abstract = {We select 25,000 galaxies from the NEWFIRM Medium Band Survey (NMBS) to study the rest-frame U - V color distribution of galaxies at 0 {\textless} z lsim 2.5. The five unique NIR filters of the NMBS enable the precise measurement of photometric redshifts and rest-frame colors for 9900 galaxies at 1 {\textless} z {\textless} 2.5. The rest-frame U - V color distribution at all z lsim 2.5 is bimodal, with a red peak, a blue peak, and a population of galaxies in between (the green valley). Model fits to the optical-NIR spectral energy distributions and the distribution of MIPS-detected galaxies indicate that the colors of galaxies in the green valley are determined largely by the amount of reddening by dust. This result does not support the simplest interpretation of green valley objects as a transition from blue star forming to red quiescent galaxies. We show that correcting the rest-frame colors for dust reddening allows a remarkably clean separation between the red and blue sequences up to z {\~{}} 2.5. Our study confirms that dusty-starburst galaxies can contribute a significant fraction to red-sequence samples selected on the basis of a single rest-frame color (i.e., U - V), so extra care must be taken if samples of truly "red and dead" galaxies are desired. Interestingly, of galaxies detected at 24 $\mu$m, 14{\%} remain on the red sequence after applying the reddening correction.},

We extensively test our ability to recover realistic star-formation histories (SFHs) with BAGPIPES by fitting mock observations of quiescent galaxies from the MUFASA simulation. We show that a double-power-law model produces better agreement with realistic SFHs than an exponentially-declining model. We then perform a detailed analysis of the SFHs of a sample of 9312 quiescent galaxies from UltraVISTA with stellar masses, {\$}M{\_}* {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}\backslash \backslashmathrm{\{}M{\_}\backslashodot{\}}{\$} and redshifts {\$}0.25 {\textless} z{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}obs{\}} {\textless} 3.75{\$}.

This behaviour is consistent with recent cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, where AGN-driven feedback in the low-accretion (jet) mode is the dominant quenching mechanism. In addition, we identify two further subsets of objects with distinct SFH shapes.

Compared to nearby quiescent galaxies of similar masses, the lensed galaxies have lower [Fe/H] and [Mg/H]. Surprisingly, the two galaxies have comparable [Mg/Fe] to similar-mass galaxies at lower redshifts, despite their old ages. Using a simple analytic chemical evolution model connecting the instantaneously recycled element Mg with the mass-loading factors of outflows averaged over the entire star formation history, we found that the lensed galaxies may have experienced enhanced outflows during their star formation compared to lower-redshift galaxies, which may explain why they quenched early.},

The observed relation and scatter is consistent with a continued increase in star formation rate at fixed mass in line with extrapolations from lower-redshift observations. It is difficult to explain this continued correlation, especially for the most massive systems, unless the most massive galaxies are forming stars near their Eddington-limited rate from their first collapse. Furthermore, we find no evidence for moderate quenching at higher masses, indicating quenching either has not occurred prior to z ∼ 6 or else occurs rapidly, so that few galaxies are visible in transition between star-forming and quenched. {\textcopyright} 2014.

Whether these galaxies were numerous enough at z{\textgreater}6 to reionize the IGM entirely depends on their production rate of H-ionizing photons, xi{\_}ion, and the fraction of these escaping into the IGM. We derive a novel diagnostic of xi{\_}ion based on the equivalent width of the bright [OIII]4959,5007 line doublet, which does not require measurements of H-recombination lines. We calibrate this diagnostic through the analysis of the luminosities of 15 nebular emission lines in high-quality optical spectra of 10 low-redshift analogs of primeval galaxies, using the new-generation spectral analysis tool Beagle. The success of this analysis confirms the ability of the models to constrain the ionized-gas properties of extreme star-forming regions, paving the way to similar analyses at high redshift. The new xi{\_}ion diagnostic can be used to derive more accurate estimates of this parameter than currently possible from the contamination by Hbeta+[OIII]4959,5007 of broad-band photometry in distant galaxies, and, in the future, from direct observations of [OIII]4959,5007 out to z{\~{}}9.5 using JWST/NIRSpec.},

The targeted lens candidates are selected spectroscopically from within the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) database of galaxy spectra for having multiple nebular emission lines at a redshift significantly higher than that of the SDSS target galaxy. In this paper, we present a catalog of 19 newly discovered gravitational lenses, along with 9 other observed candidate systems that are either possible lenses, non-lenses, or non-detections. The survey efficiency is thus {\textgreater}=68{\%}. We also present Gemini and Magellan IFU data for 9 of the SLACS targets, which further support the lensing interpretation. A new method for the effective subtraction of foreground galaxy images to reveal faint background features is presented. We show that the SLACS lens galaxies have colors and ellipticities typical of the spectroscopic parent sample from which they are drawn (SDSS luminous red galaxies and quiescent main-sample galaxies), but are somewhat brighter and more centrally concentrated. Several explanations for the latter bias are suggested. The SLACS survey provides the first statistically significant and homogeneously selected sample of bright early-type lens galaxies, furnishing a powerful probe of the structure of early-type galaxies within the half-light radius. The high confirmation rate of lenses in the SLACS survey suggests consideration of spectroscopic lens discovery as an explicit science goal of future spectroscopic galaxy surveys (abridged).},

abstract = {We study the relations between stellar mass, star formation history, size and internal structure for a complete sample of 122,808 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We show that low-redshift galaxies divide into two distinct families at a stellar mass of 3 $\backslash$times 10{\^{}}10 M{\_}sol. Lower mass galaxies have young stellar populations, low surface mass densities and the low concentrations typical of disks. A significant fraction of the lowest mass galaxies in our sample have experienced recent starbursts. At given stellar mass, the sizes of low mass galaxies are log- normally distributed with dispersion sigma(ln R{\_}50) $\backslash$sim 0.5, in excellent agreement with the idea that they form with little angular momentum loss through cooling and condensation in a gravitationally dominant dark matter halo. Their median stellar surface mass density scales with stellar mass as mu* propto M{\_}*{\^{}}0.54, suggesting that the stellar mass of a disk galaxy is proprtional to the three halves power of its halo mass. This suggests that the efficiency of the conversion of baryons into stars in low mass galaxies increases in propor- tion to halo mass, perhaps as a result of supernova feedback processes. At stellar masses above 3 $\backslash$times 10{\^{}}10 M{\_}sol, there is a rapidly increasing frac- tion of galaxies with old stellar populations, high surface mass densities and high concentrations typical of bulges. In this regime, the size distribution is log-normal, but its dispersion decreases rapidly with increasing stellar mass and the median mass surface density is approximately constant. This suggests that the star formation efficiency decreases in the highest mass halos, and that little star formation occurs in massive galaxies once they have assembled.},

Our high-fidelity 0.07{\$}''{\$}-resolution imaging ({\$}\backslashsim{\$}500 pc) reveals robust evidence for structures with deconvolved sizes of {\$}\backslashlesssim{\$}0.5-1 kpc embedded within (dominant) exponential dust disks. The large-scale morphologies of the structures within some of the galaxies show clear curvature and/or clump-like structures bracketing elongated nuclear emission, suggestive of bars, star-forming rings, and spiral arms. In this interpretation, the ratio of the `ring' and `bar' radii (1.9{\$}\backslashpm{\$}0.3) agrees with that measured for such features in local galaxies. These potential spiral/ring/bar structures would be consistent with the idea of tidal disturbances, with their detailed properties implying flat inner rotation curves and Toomre-unstable disks (Q{\textless}1). The inferred one-dimensional velocity dispersions ({\$}\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm r{\}}\backslashlesssim{\$} 70-160 km s{\$}{\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}{\$}) are marginally consistent with the limits implied if the sizes of the largest structures are comparable to the Jeans length. We create maps of the star formation rate density ({\$}\backslashSigma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm SFR{\}}{\$}) on {\$}\backslashsim{\$}500 pc scales and show that the SMGs are able to sustain a given (galaxy-averaged) {\$}\backslashSigma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm SFR{\}}{\$} over much larger physical scales than local (ultra-)luminous infrared galaxies. However, on 500 pc scales, they do not exceed the Eddington limit set by radiation pressure on dust. If confirmed by kinematics, the potential presence of non-axisymmetric structures would provide a means for net angular momentum loss and efficient star formation, helping to explain the very high star formation rates measured in SMGs.},

abstract = {Galaxy formation is at the heart of our understanding of cosmic evolution. Although there is a consensus that galaxies emerged from the expanding matter background by gravitational instability of primordial fluctuations, a number of additional physical processes must be understood and implemented in theoretical models before these can be reliably used to interpret observations. In parallel, the astonishing recent progresses made in detecting galaxies that formed only a few hundreds of million years after the Big Bang is pushing the quest for more sophisticated and detailed studies of early structures. In this review, we combine the information gleaned from different theoretical models/studies to build a coherent picture of the Universe in its early stages which includes the physics of galaxy formation along with the impact that early structures had on large-scale processes as cosmic reionization and metal enrichment of the intergalactic medium.},

We use a homogeneously selected sample of field and cluster galaxies whose membership is derived from dynamical analysis. Using [{\$}\backslashrm{\{}O{\{}\backslashsmall II{\}}{\}}{\$}]-derived star formation rates (SFRs), we find that cluster galaxies have suppressed SFRs at fixed stellar mass in comparison to their field counterparts by a factor of 1.4 ± 0.1 (∼3.3$\sigma$) across the stellar mass range: 9.0 {\textless} log (M*/M⊙) {\textless} 11.2. We also find that this modest suppression in the cluster galaxy star-forming main sequence is mass and redshift dependent: the difference between cluster and field increases towards lower stellar masses and lower redshift. When comparing the distribution of cluster and field galaxy SFRs to the star-forming main sequence, we find an overall shift towards lower SFRs in the cluster population, and note the absence of a tail of high SFR galaxies as seen in the field. Given this observed suppression in the cluster galaxy star-forming main sequence, we explore the implications for several scenarios such as formation time differences between cluster and field galaxies, and environmentally induced star formation quenching and associated time-scales.},

abstract = {In the hierarchical theory of galaxy formation, a galaxy overdensity is a hallmark of a massive cosmic structure. However, it is less well understood how different types of galaxies trace the underlying large-scale structure. Motivated by the discovery of a z=3.13 protocluster, we examine how the same structure is populated by Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$}-emitting galaxies (LAEs). To this end, we have undertaken a deep narrow-band imaging survey sampling Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emission at this redshift. Of the 93 LAE candidates within a 36'x36'{\~{}}(70x70{\~{}}Mpc{\^{}}2) field, 21 galaxies form a significant surface overdensity (delta{\_}g=3.3+/-0.9), which is spatially segregated from the Lyman break galaxy (LBG) overdensity. One possible interpretation is that they trace two separate structures of comparable masses ({\~{}} 10{\^{}}{\{}15{\}}M{\_}sun) where the latter is hosted by a halo assembled at an earlier time. We speculate that the dearth of LAEs in the LBG overdensity region may signal the role of halo assembly bias in galaxy formation, which would suggest that different search techniques may be biased accordingly to the formation age or dynamical state of the host halo. The median Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$}- and UV luminosity is 30--70$\backslash${\%} higher for the protocluster LAEs relative to the field. This difference cannot be explained by the galaxy overdensity alone, and may require a top-heavy mass function, higher star formation efficiency for protocluster halos, or suppression of galaxy formation in low-mass halos. A luminous Ly{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} blob and an ultramassive galaxy found in this region paint a picture consistent with the expected early growth of galaxies in clusters.},

Galaxies are simultaneously modelled in multiple bands using the tools developed by the MegaMorph project, allowing robust size (i.e. half-light radius) estimates even for small, faint, and high redshift galaxies. We show that above 107 M⊙, star-forming galaxies are well represented by a single power law on the mass–size plane over our entire redshift range. Conversely, the stellar mass–size relation is steep for quiescent galaxies with stellar masses {\$}\backslashge 10{\^{}}{\{}10.3{\}}\backslash, {\{}\backslashrm M{\}}{\_}\backslashodot{\$} and flattens at lower masses, regardless of whether quiescence is selected based on star-formation activity, rest-frame colours, or structural characteristics.

@article{Schaerer2002,
abstract = {If there is one key element in the social psychology of behaviour that is still missing from Stern's ABC model, it is the role of habit. Stern (2000) acknowledges this and proposes that an integrated model of environmentally significant behaviour would consist of four factors: 1) attitudes; 2) contextual factors; 3) personal capabilities; and 4) habits. The general thrust of Stern's suggestion is very similar to an attempt made almost thirty years ago by social psychologist Harry Triandis to develop an integrated model of 'interpersonal' behaviour. Triandis recognised the key role played by both social factors and emotions in forming intentions. He also highlighted the importance of past behaviour on the present. On the basis of these observations, Triandis proposed a Theory of Interpersonal Behaviour (Figure 4) in which intentions – as in many of the other models – are immediate antecedents of behaviour. But crucially, habits also mediate behaviour. And both these influences are moderated by facilitating conditions. Behaviour in any situation is, according to Triandis, a function partly of the intention, partly of the habitual responses, and partly of the situational constraints and conditions. The intention is influenced by social and affective factors as well as by rational deliberations. One is neither fully deliberative, in Triandis' model, nor fully automatic. One is neither fully autonomous nor entirely social. Behaviour is influenced by moral beliefs, but the impact of these is moderated both by emotional drives and cognitive limitations. Social factors include norms, roles and self-concept. Norms are the social rules about what should and should not be done. Roles are 'sets of behaviours that are considered appropriate for persons holding particular positions in a group' (Triandis, 1977). Self-concept refers to the idea that a person has of his/herself, the goals that it is appropriate for the person to pursue or to eschew, and the behaviours that the person does or does not engage in. Emotional responses to a decision or to a decision situation are assumed distinct from rational-instrumental evaluations of consequences, and may include both positive and negative emotional responses of varying strengths. Affect has a more or less unconscious input to decision-making, and is governed by instinctive behavioural responses to particular situations. Figure 3 Triandis' Theory of Interpersonal Behaviour Triandis offers an explicit role for affective factors on behavioural intentions. In more recent writings, the attempt to incorporate emotional antecedents into a model of action has received a lot of support (Bagozzi et al., 2002, Steg et al., 2001). Triandis theory of interpersonal behaviour captures many of the criticisms levelled at rational choice theory in a way that is not done by some of the other models. It also can be, and has been, used as a framework for empirical analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the component factors in different kinds of situations. It also can be, and has been, used as the framework for empirical analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the component factors in different kinds of situations. Far less use has been made of Triandis work than was made of the Ajzen-Fishbein work. However, where it has been used, it appears to have additional explanatory value over Ajzen's model, in particular, by including role beliefs and habits. Affect},

abstract = {We present a new mass function of galaxy clusters and groups using optical/near-infrared (NIR) wavelength spectroscopic and photometric data from the Observations of Redshift Evolution in Large-Scale Environments (ORELSE) survey. At z ∼ 1, cluster mass function studies are rare regardless of wavelength and have never been attempted from an optical/NIR perspective. This work serves as a proof of concept that z ∼ 1 cluster mass functions are achievable without supplemental X-ray or Sunyaev-Zel'dovich data. Measurements of the cluster mass function provide important contraints on cosmological parameters and are complementary to other probes. With ORELSE, a new cluster finding technique based on Voronoi tessellation Monte Carlo (VMC) mapping, and rigorous purity and completeness testing, we have obtained ∼240 galaxy overdensity candidates in the redshift range 0.55 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.37 at a mass range of 13.6 {\textless} log (M/M⊙) {\textless} 14.8. This mass range is comparable to existing optical cluster mass function studies for the local universe. Our candidate numbers vary based on the choice of multiple input parameters related to detection and characterization in our cluster finding algorithm, which we incorporated into the mass function analysis through a Monte Carlo scheme. We find cosmological constraints on the matter density, $\Omega$m, and the amplitude of fluctuations, $\sigma$8, of {\$}\backslashOmega {\_}{\{}m{\}} = 0.250{\^{}}{\{}+0.104{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.099{\}}{\$} and {\$}\backslashsigma {\_}{\{}8{\}} = 1.150{\^{}}{\{}+0.260{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.163{\}}{\$}. While our $\Omega$m value is close to concordance, our $\sigma$8 value is ∼2$\sigma$ higher because of the inflated observed number densities compared to theoretical mass function models owing to how our survey targeted overdense regions. With Euclid and several other large, unbiased optical surveys on the horizon, VMC mapping will enable optical/NIR cluster cosmology at redshifts much higher than what has been possible before.},

abstract = {Despite decades of study, we still do not fully understand why some massive galaxies abruptly switch off their star formation in the early Universe, and what causes their rapid transition to the red sequence. Post-starburst galaxies provide a rare opportunity to study this transition phase, but few have currently been spectroscopically identified at high redshift ({\$}z{\textgreater}1{\$}). In this paper we present the spectroscopic verification of a new photometric technique to identify post-starbursts in high-redshift surveys. The method classifies the broad-band optical-near--infrared spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of galaxies using three spectral shape parameters (super-colours), derived from a principal component analysis of model SEDs. When applied to the multiwavelength photometric data in the UKIDSS Ultra Deep Survey (UDS), this technique identified over 900 candidate post-starbursts at redshifts {\$}0.5{\textless}z{\textless}2.0{\$}. In this study we present deep optical spectroscopy for a subset of these galaxies, in order to confirm their post-starburst nature. Where a spectroscopic assessment was possible, we find the majority (19/24 galaxies; {\~{}}80 per cent) exhibit the strong Balmer absorption (H {\$}\backslashdelta{\$} equivalent width {\$}W{\_}{\{}\backslashlambda{\}}{\$} {\textgreater}5 Ang.) and Balmer break, characteristic of post-starburst galaxies. We conclude that photometric methods can be used to select large samples of recently-quenched galaxies in the distant Universe.},

This NEWFIRM HETDEX Survey (NHS) reaches a 5-sigma depth of 22.4 AB mag (2"-diameter apertures corrected to total), is {\~{}}50{\%} and 90{\%} complete at K{\~{}}22.65 and K{\~{}}22.15, respectively, and covers 22 deg{\^{}}2 of the 24 deg{\^{}}2 SHELA Spitzer/ IRAC footprint (within ``Stripe 82' of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey). We present a K{\_}s-band-selected catalog which includes deep ugriz imaging from the Dark Energy Camera and 3.6 and 4.5 um imaging from Spitzer/IRAC, with forced-photometry of 1.7 million sources across 17.5 deg{\^{}}2. The large area and moderate depth of this catalog enables the study of the most massive galaxies at high redshift, and minimizes uncertainties associated with counting statistics and cosmic variance. As a demonstration, we derive stellar masses (M*) and star-formation rates (SFRs) for candidate galaxies at 3 {\textless} z {\textless} 5, and select a conservative sample of nine candidate massive (M* {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}11 Msol) quiescent galaxies, which have measured SFRs significantly below the main-sequence at this redshift. Five are ultra-massive with M* {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}12, though uncertainties in IRAC blending, gravitational lensing, or AGN emission could result in true masses which are lower. Simulations predict that these galaxies should be extremely rare, thus we discuss what physical processes in models could be altered to allow the formation of such massive quiescent galaxies at such early times.},

abstract = {Aims: We study the stellar mass content of massive haloes in the redshift range 0.86 {\textless} z {\textless} 1.34, by measuring (1) the stellar mass in the central galaxy versus total dynamical halo mass; (2) the total stellar mass (including satellites) versus total halo mass; and (3) the radial stellar mass and number density profiles for the ensemble halo. Methods: We use a Ks-band selected catalogue for the 10 clusters in the Gemini Cluster Astrophysics Spectroscopic Survey (GCLASS), with photometric redshifts and stellar masses measured from 11-band SED fitting. Combining the photometric catalogues with the deep spectroscopic component of GCLASS, we correct the cluster galaxy sample for interlopers. We also perform a dynamical analysis of the cluster galaxies to estimate the halo mass M200 for each cluster based on a measurement of its velocity dispersion. Results: (1) We find that the central galaxy stellar mass fraction decreases with total halo mass and that this is in reasonable, quantitative agreement with measurements from abundance matching studies at z {\~{}} 1. (2) The total stellar mass fractions of these systems decrease with halo mass, indicating that lower mass systems are more efficient at transforming baryons into stars. We find the total stellar mass to be a good proxy for total halo mass, with a small intrinsic scatter. When we compare these results from GCLASS with literature measurements, we find that the stellar mass fraction at fixed halo mass shows no significant evolution in the range 0 {\textless} z {\textless} 1. (3) We measure a relatively high NFW concentration parameter cg {\~{}} 7 for the stellar mass distribution in these clusters, and debate a possible scenario for explaining the evolution of the stellar mass distribution from the GCLASS sample to their likely descendants at lower redshift. Conclusions: The stellar mass measurements in the z {\~{}} 1 haloes provided by GCLASS puts constraints on the stellar mass assembly history of clusters observed in the local Universe. A simple model shows that the stellar mass content of GCLASS can evolve in typical distributions observed at lower redshifts if the clusters primarily accrete stellar mass onto the outskirts.},

In the standard LCDM cosmology, the first star-forming halos within our Hubble volume started collapsing at these redshifts, allowing the chemistry of life to possibly begin when the Universe was merely 15 million years old.

abstract = {In large-scale cosmological hydrodynamic simulations simplified sub-grid models for gas accretion on to black holes and AGN feedback are commonly used. Such models typically depend on various free parameters, which are not well constrained.We present a new advanced model containing a more detailed description ofAGNfeedback, where those parameters reflect the results of recent observations. The model takes the dependence of these parameters on the black hole properties into account and describes a continuous transition between the feedback processes acting in the so-called radio-mode and quasar-mode. In addition, we implement a more detailed description of the accretion of gas on to black holes by distinguishing between hot and cold gas accretion. Our new implementations prevent black holes from gaining too much mass, particularly at low redshifts, so that our simulations are successful in reproducing the observed present-day black hole mass function. Our new model also suppresses star formation in massive galaxies slightly more efficiently than many state-of-the-art models. Therefore, the simulations that include our new implementations produce a more realistic population of quiescent and star-forming galaxies compared to recent observations, even if some discrepancies remain. In addition, the baryon conversion efficiencies in our simulation are-except for the high-mass end-consistent with observations presented in the literature over the mass range resolved by our simulations. Finally, we discuss the significant impact of the feedback model on the low-luminous end of the AGN luminosity function.},

abstract = {We investigate how the environment affects the assembly history of massive galaxies. For that purpose, we make use of SHARDS and HST spectro-photometric data, whose depth, spectral resolution, and wavelength coverage allow to perform a detailed analysis of the stellar emission as well as obtaining unprecedentedly accurate photometric redshifts. This expedites a sufficiently accurate estimate of the local environment and a robust derivation of the star formation histories of a complete sample of 332 massive galaxies ({\$}\backslashmathrm{\{}{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\}}{\$}) at redshift {\$}1\backslashleq z \backslashleq 1.5{\$} in the GOODS-N field.

abstract = {ONE of the most direct methods of constraining the epoch at which the first galaxies formed-and thereby to constrain the age of the Universe-is to identify and date the oldest galaxies at high redshift. But most distant galaxies have been identified on the basis of their abnormal brightness in some spectral region1-4 such selection criteria are biased towards objects with pronounced nuclear activity or young star-forming systems, in which the spectral signature of older stellar populations will be concealed. Here we report the discovery of a weak and extremely red radio galaxy (53W091) at z = 1.55, and present spectroscopic evidence that its red colour results from a population of old stars. Comparing our spectral data with models of the evolution of stellar populations, we estimate that we are observing this galaxy at least 3.5 Gyr after star-formation activity ceased. This implies an extremely high formation redshift (z {\textgreater} 4) for 53W091 and, by inference, other elliptical galaxies. Moreover, the age of 53W091 is greater than the predicted age of the Universe at z = 1.55, under the assumption of a standard Einstein-de Sitter cosmology (for any Hubble constant greater than 50kms-1 Mpc-1), indicating that this cosmological model can be formally excluded.},

Its light curves are similar to the prototypical SN2002cx, but are slightly broader and have a later rise to maximum in g. SN2009ku is brighter ({\~{}}0.6 mag) than other SN2002cx-like objects, peaking at M{\_}V = -18.4 mag - which is still significantly fainter than typical SNeIa. SN2009ku, which had an ejecta velocity of {\~{}}2000 kms{\^{}}-1 at 18 days after maximum brightness is spectroscopically most similar to SN2008ha, which also had extremely low-velocity ejecta. However, SN2008ha had an exceedingly low luminosity, peaking at M{\_}V = -14.2 mag, {\~{}}4 mag fainter than SN2009ku. The contrast of high luminosity and low ejecta velocity for SN2009ku is contrary to an emerging trend seen for the SN2002cx class. SN2009ku is a counter-example of a previously held belief that the class was more homogeneous than typical SNeIa, indicating that the class has a diverse progenitor population and/or complicated explosion physics. As the first example of a member of this class of objects from the new generation of transient surveys, SN2009ku is an indication of the potential for these surveys to find rare and interesting objects.},

In conjunction with spectra from other surveys, we confirm earlier indications that LAEs have a much higher [OIII]/[OII] line ratio than is seen in similar redshift LBGs. By comparing their distributions on a [OIII]/[OII] versus R23 diagram, we demonstrate that this difference cannot arise solely because of their lower metallicities but most likely is due to a harder ionizing spectrum. Using measures of H-beta and recombination theory, we demonstrate, for a subset of our LAEs, that xi{\_}ion - the number of Lyman continuum photons per UV luminosity - is indeed 0.2-0.5 dex larger than for typical LBGs at similar redshifts. Using photoionization models we estimate the effect this would have on both [OIII]/[OII] and R23 and conclude such a hard spectrum can only partially explain such intense line emission. The additional possibility is that such a large [OIII]/[OII] ratio is in part due to density rather than ionization bound nebular regions, which would imply a high escape fraction of ionizing photons. We discuss how further observations could confirm this possibility. Clearly LAEs with intense [OIII] emission represent a promising analog of those z{\textgreater}7 sources with similarly strong lines which are thought to be an important contributor to cosmic reionization.},

At z {\$}{\textgreater} 1{\$}, the entire population of star-forming galaxies has {\$}\backslashsim{\$}5 - 10{\$}\backslashtimes{\$} shorter gas depletion times ({\$}\backslashsim0.2{\$} Gyr) than galaxies at low redshift. These {\{}$\backslash$bf shorter depletion times are due to a different, dominant mode of SF in the early universe{\}} -- dynamically driven by compressive, high dispersion gas motions and/or galaxy interactions. The dispersive gas motions are a natural consequence of the extraordinarily high gas accretion rates which must occur to maintain the prodigious SF.},

abstract = {Observations of low order 12 C 16 O transitions represent the most direct way to study galaxies' cold molecular gas, the fuel of star formation. Here we present the first detection of CO(J=2→1) in a galaxy lying on the main-sequence of star-forming galaxies at z {\textgreater} 6. Our target, G09-83808 at z = 6.03, has a short depletion timescale of $\tau$ dep ≈ 50 Myr and a relatively low gas fraction of M gas /M ≈ 0.30 that contrasts with those measured for lower redshift main-sequence galaxies. We conclude that this galaxy is undergoing a starburst episode with a high star formation efficiency that might be the result of gas compression within its compact rotating disk. Its starburst-like nature is further supported by its high star formation rate surface density, thus favoring the use of the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation as a more precise diagnostic diagram. Without further significant gas accretion, this galaxy would become a compact, massive quiescent galaxy at z ∼ 5.5. In addition, we find that the calibration for estimating ISM masses from dust continuum emission satisfactorily reproduces the gas mass derived from the CO(2→1) transition (within a factor of ∼ 2). This is in line with previous studies claiming a small redshift evolution in the gas-to-dust ratio of massive, metal-rich galaxies. In the absence of gravitational amplification, this detection would have required of order 1000 h of observing time. The detection of cold molecular gas in unlensed star-forming galaxies at high redshifts is thus prohibitive with current facilities and requires a tenfold improvement in sensitivity, such as that envisaged for the ngVLA.},

abstract = {We study the evolution of the observed correlation between central stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma$e and stellar mass M∗ of massive (M∗ ≿ 3 × 1010 M☉) early-type galaxies (ETGs) out to redshift z ≈ 2.5, taking advantage of a Bayesian hierarchical inference formalism. Collecting ETGs from state-of-the-art literature samples, we build a fiducial sample (0 ≾ z ≾ 1), which is obtained with homogeneous selection criteria, but also a less homogeneous extended sample (0 ≾ z ≾ 2.5). Based on the fiducial sample, we find that at z ≾ 1 the M∗-$\sigma$e relation is well represented by $\sigma$e ∝ M∗$\beta$(1 + z)$\zeta$, with $\beta$ ≃ 0.18 independent of redshift and $\zeta$ ≃ 0.4 (at a given M∗, $\sigma$e decreases for decreasing z, for instance by a factor of ≈1.3 from z = 1 to z = 0). When the slope $\beta$ is allowed to evolve, we find it increasing with redshift: $\beta$(z) ≃ 0.16 + 0.26log (1 + z) describes the data as well as constant $\beta$ ≃ 0.18. The intrinsic scatter of the M∗-$\sigma$e relation is ≃0.08 dex in $\sigma$e at given M∗, independent of redshift. Our results suggest that, on average, the velocity dispersion of individual massive (M∗ ≿ 3 × 1011M☉) ETGs decreases with time while they evolve from z ≈ 1 to z ≈ 0. The analysis of the extended sample, over the wider redshift range 0 ≾ z ≾ 2.5, leads to results similar to that of the fiducial sample, with slightly stronger redshift dependence of the normalization ($\zeta$ ≃ 0.5) and weaker redshift dependence of the slope (d$\beta$/dlog (1 + z) ≃ 0.18) when $\beta$ varies with time. At z = 2 ETGs with M∗ ≈ 1011 M☉ have, on average, ≈1.7 higher $\sigma$e than ETGs of similar stellar mass at z = 0.},

abstract = {We present the results of a new search for galaxies at redshift z ≃ 9 in the first two Hubble Frontier Fieldswith completed HST WFC3/IR andACS imaging. To ensure robust photometric redshift solutions, and to minimize incompleteness, we confine our search to objects with H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}160{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} {\textless} 28.6 (AB mag), consider only image regions with an rms noise $\sigma${\textless}inf{\textgreater}160{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} {\textgreater} 30 mag (within a 0.5-arcsec diameter aperture), and insist on detections in both H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}160{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and J{\textless}inf{\textgreater}140{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}. The result is a survey covering an effective area (after accounting for magnification) of 10.9 arcmin{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, which yields 12 galaxies at 8.4 {\textless} z {\textless} 9.5. Within the Abell-2744 cluster and parallel fields, we confirm the three brightest objects reported by Ishigaki et al., but recover only one of the four z {\textgreater} 8.4 sources reported by Zheng et al. In the MACSJ0416.1-240 cluster field, we report five objects, and explain why each of these eluded detection or classification as z ≃ 9 galaxies in the published searches of the shallower CLASH data. Finally, we uncover four z ≃ 9 galaxies from the MACSJ0416.1-240 parallel field. Based on the published magnification maps, we find that only one of these 12 galaxies is likely boosted by more than a factor of 2 by gravitational lensing. Consequently, we are able to perform a fairly straightforward reanalysis of the normalization of the z ≃ 9 UV galaxy luminosity function as explored previously in the HUDF12 programme. We conclude that the new data strengthen the evidence for a continued smooth decline in UV luminosity density (and hence star formation rate density) from z ≃ 8 to 9, contrary to recent reports of a marked drop-off at these redshifts. This provides further support for the scenario in which early galaxy evolution is sufficiently extended to explain cosmic reionization.},

The H2S1 narrow-band filter ($\lambda$c = 2.121$\mu$m) we employ selects the H$\alpha$ emission-line redshifted to z = 2.23, and is thus suitable for selecting `typical' star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei at this epoch. The pilot study was undertaken in the well-studied Cosmological Evolution Survey field (COSMOS) and is already the largest near-infrared narrow-band survey at this depth, with a line flux limit of FH$\alpha$ {\~{}} 10-16ergs-1cm-2 over 0.60deg2, probing {\~{}}220 × 103Mpc3 (comoving) down to a limiting star formation rate of {\~{}}30Msolaryr-1 (3$\sigma$). In this paper, we present the results from our pilot survey and evaluate the H$\alpha$ luminosity function and estimate the clustering properties of H$\alpha$ emitters at z = 2.23 from 55 detected galaxies. The integrated luminosity function is used to estimate the volume-averaged star formation rate at z = 2.23: $\rho$SFR = 0.17+0.16-0.09Msolaryr-1Mpc-3 for LH$\alpha$ {\textgreater} 1042ergs-1. For the first time, we use the H$\alpha$ star formation tracer to reliably constrain $\rho$SFR out to z = 2.23 demonstrating the rapid increase in $\rho$SFR out to this redshift as well as confirming the flattening in $\rho$SFR between z {\~{}} 1 and 2. In addition to the luminosity distribution, we analyse the clustering properties of these galaxies. Using the two-point angular correlation function, $\omega$($\theta$), we estimate a real-space correlation length of r0 = 4.2+0.4-0.2h-1Mpc. In comparison to models of clustering which take into account bias evolution, we estimate that these galaxies are hosted by dark matter haloes of mass Mhalo {\~{}} 1012Msolar consistent with the progenitors of the Milky Way.

abstract = {The emergence of passive galaxies in the early Universe results from the interplay among the physical processes responsible for their rapid assembly and for the abrupt shut-down of their SF. Investigating the individual properties and demographics of early passive galaxies will improve our understanding of these mechanisms. In this work we present a follow-up analysis of the z{\textgreater}3 passive galaxy candidates selected by Merlin et al. (2019) in the CANDELS fields. We begin by first confirming the accuracy of their passive classification by exploiting their sub-mm emission to demonstrate the lack of ongoing SF. Using archival ALMA observations we are able to confirm at least 61{\%} of the observed candidates as passive. While the remainder lack sufficiently deep data for confirmation, we are able to validate the entire sample in a statistical sense. We then estimate the Stellar Mass Function (SMF) of all 101 passive candidates in three redshift bins from z=5 to z=3. We adopt a stepwise approach that has the advantage of taking into account photometric errors, mass completeness and the Eddington bias without any a-posteriori correction. We observe a pronounced evolution in the SMF around z{\~{}}4, indicating that we are witnessing the emergence of the passive population at this epoch. Massive (M{\textgreater}10{\^{}}11Msun) passive galaxies, only accounting for a small ({\textless}20{\%}) fraction of galaxies at z{\textgreater}4, become dominant at later epochs. Thanks to a combination of photometric quality, sample selection and methodology, we overall find a higher density of passive galaxies than previous works. The comparison with theoretical predictions, despite a qualitative agreement, denotes a still incomplete understanding of the physical processes responsible for the formation of these galaxies. Finally, we extrapolate our results to predict the number of early passive galaxies expected in surveys carried out with future facilities.},

We measure a fractional anisotropy dI / I = 14 +- 4{\%}, detecting signatures arising from the clustering of dusty star-forming galaxies in both the linear (2-halo) and non-linear (1-halo) regimes; and that the transition from the 2- to 1-halo terms, below which power originates predominantly from multiple galaxies within dark matter halos, occurs at k{\_}theta {\~{}} 0.1 - 0.12 arcmin{\^{}}-1 (l {\~{}} 2160 - 2380), from 250 to 500um. New to this paper is clear evidence of a dependence of the Poisson and 1-halo power on the flux-cut level of masked sources --- suggesting that some fraction of the more luminous sources occupy more massive halos as satellites, or are possibly close pairs. We measure the cross-correlation power spectra between bands, finding that bands which are farthest apart are the least correlated, as well as hints of a reduction in the correlation between bands when resolved sources are more aggressively masked. In the second part of the paper we attempt to interpret the measurements in the framework of the halo model. With the aim of fitting simultaneously with one model the power spectra, number counts, and absolute CIB level in all bands, we find that this is achievable by invoking a luminosity-mass relationship, such that the luminosity-to-mass ratio peaks at a particular halo mass scale and declines towards lower and higher mass halos. Our best-fit model finds that the halo mass which is most efficient at hosting star formation in the redshift range of peak star-forming activity, z {\~{}} 1-3, is log(M{\_}peak/M{\_}sun) {\~{}} 12.1 +- 0.5, and that the minimum halo mass to host infrared galaxies is log(M{\_}min/M{\_}sun) {\~{}} 10.1 +- 0.6.},

abstract = {We present a new analysis of the rest-frame B-band COMBO-17 and DEEP2 luminosity functions (LFs) of early-type galaxies (ETGs) as a function of luminosity and mass. Our aim is to place new stringent constraints on the evolution of ETGs since z{\~{}}1. We correct the LF({\$}z{\$}) data for the luminosity dimming assuming pure luminosity evolution. However, instead of relying on stellar population synthesis model--dependent assumptions, we adopt the empirical luminosity dimming rate derived from the evolution of the Fundamental Plane of field and cluster massive ETGs.Our results show that the amount of evolution for the ETG population depends critically on the range of luminosity and masses considered. While the number density of luminous (massive) ETGs with M{\_}B(z=0){\textless} -20.5 (Mass {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}11 M{\_}Sun) is nearly constant since z{\~{}}0.8, less luminous galaxies display a deficit which grows with redshift and that can be explained with a gradual population of the ETG "red sequence" by the progressive quenching of star formation in galaxies less massive than {\~{}}10{\^{}}11 M{\_}Sun. At each redshift there is a critical mass above which virtually all ETGs appear to be in place, and this fits well in the now popular "downsizing" scenario. However, ``downsizing'' does not appear to be limited to star formation, but the concept may have to be extended to the mass assembly itself as the build-up of the most massive galaxies preceeds that of the less massive ones. This evolutionary trend is not reproduced by the most recent theoretical simulations even when they successfully reproduce "downsizing" in star formation.},

abstract = {Much of the science that is made possible by multiwavelength redshift surveys requires the use of photometric redshifts. But as these surveys become more ambitious, and as we seek to perform increasingly accurate measurements, it becomes crucial to take proper account of the photometric redshift uncertainties. Ideally the uncertainties can be directly measured using a comparison with spectroscopic redshifts, but this may yield misleading results since spectroscopic samples are frequently small and not representative of the parent photometric samples. We present a simple and powerful empirical method to constrain photometric redshift uncertainties in the absence of spectroscopic redshifts. Close pairs of galaxies on the sky have a significant probability of being physically associated and therefore of lying at nearly the same redshift. The difference in photometric redshifts in close pairs is therefore a measure of the redshift uncertainty. Some observed close pairs will arise from chance projections along the line of sight, but it is straightforward to perform a statistical correction for this effect. We demonstrate the technique using both simulated data and actual observations, and discuss how its usefulness can be limited by the presence of systematic photometric redshift errors. Finally, we use this technique to show how photometric redshift accuracy can depend on galaxy type.},

abstract = {We analyze the optical spectral properties of the complete sample of Very Luminous Infrared Galaxies presented by Wu et al., and we find a high fraction ({\~{}}50{\%}) of spectra showing both a strong H$\delta$ line in absorption and relatively modest [O II] emission [e(a) spectra]. The e(a) signature has been proposed as an efficient method to identify dusty starburst galaxies, and we study the star formation activity and the nature of these galaxies, as well as the effects of dust on their observed properties. We examine their emission-line characteristics, in particular their [O II]/H$\alpha$ ratio, and we find this to be greatly affected by reddening. A search for AGN spectral signatures reveals that the e(a) galaxies are typically H II/LINER galaxies. We compare the star formation rates derived from the FIR luminosities with the estimates based on the H$\alpha$ line and find that the values obtained from the optical emission lines are a factor of 10-70 (H$\alpha$) and 20-140 ([O II]) lower than the FIR estimates (50-300 M☉ yr-1). We then study the morphological properties of the e(a) galaxies, looking for a near companion or signs of a merger/interaction. In order to explore the evolution of the e(a) population, we present an overview of the available observations of e(a) galaxies in different environments both at low and high redshift. Finally, we discuss the role of dust in determining the e(a) spectral properties and we propose a scenario of selective obscuration in which the extinction decreases with the stellar age.},

abstract = {Infrared (IR) emission spectra are calculated for dust composed of mixtures of amorphous silicate and graphitic grains, including varying amounts of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) particles. The models are constrained to reproduce the average Milky Way extinction curve. The calculations include the effects of single-photon heating. Updated IR absorption properties for the PAHs are presented, that are consistent with observed emission spectra, including those newly obtained by Spitzer Space Telescope. We find a size distribution for the PAHs that results in emission band ratios consistent with observed spectra of the Milky Way and other galaxies. Emission spectra are presented for various intensities of the illuminating starlight. We calculate how the efficiency of emission into different IR bands depends on PAH size; the strong 7.7um emission feature is produced mainly by PAH particles containing {\textless}1000 C atoms. We show how the emission spectrum depends on U, the starlight intensity relative to the local interstellar radiation field. The submm and far-infrared emission is compared to the observed emission from the local interstellar medium. Using a simple distribution function, we calculate the emission spectrum for dust heated by a distribution of starlight intensities, such as occurs within galaxies. The models are parameterized by the PAH mass fraction qpah, the lower cutoff Umin, and the fraction gamma of the dust heated by starlight with U{\textgreater}Umin. We present graphical procedures using IRAC and MIPS photometry to estimate qpah, Umin, and gamma, the fraction f{\_}PDR of the dust luminosity coming from photodissociation regions with U{\textgreater}100, and the total dust mass Mdust.},

This dataset is combined with ancillary optical and NIR fluxes to constrain the dust attenuation law in the rest-frame NUV region of star-forming galaxies within the redshift window 1.5{\textless}z{\textless}3. We focus on the NUV bump strength (B) and the total-to-selective extinction ratio (Rv), targeting a sample of 1,753 galaxies. By comparing the data with a set of population synthesis models coupled to a parametric dust attenuation law, we constrain Rv and B, as well as the colour excess, E(B-V). We find a correlation between Rv and B, that can be interpreted either as a result of the grain size distribution, or a variation of the dust geometry among galaxies. According to the former, small dust grains are associated with a stronger NUV bump. The latter would lead to a range of clumpiness in the distribution of dust within the interstellar medium of star-forming galaxies. The observed wide range of NUV bump strengths can lead to a systematic in the interpretation of the UV slope ({\$}\backslashbeta{\$}) typically used to characterize the dust content. In this study we quantify these variations, concluding that the effects are {\$}\backslashDelta\backslashbeta{\$}{\~{}}0.4.},

abstract = {Dust is a crucial component of the interstellar medium of galaxies. The presence of dust strongly affects the light produced by stars within a galaxy. As these photons are our main information vector to explore the stellar mass assembly and therefore understand a galaxy's evolution, modeling the luminous properties of galaxies and taking into account the impact of the dust is a fundamental challenge for semi-analytical models.We present the complete prescription of dust attenuation implemented in the new semi-analytical model: G.A.S. This model is based on a two-phase medium originating from a physically motivated turbulent model of gas structuring (G.A.S. I paper). Dust impact is treated by taking into account three dust components: Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, Very Small Grains, and Big Grains. All three components evolve in both a diffuse and a fragmented/dense gas phase. Each phase has its own stars, dust content and geometry. Dust content evolves according to the metallicity of it associated phase.The G.A.S. model is used to predict both the UV and the IR luminosity functions from {\$}z=9.0{\$} to {\$}z=0.1{\$}. Our two-phase ISM prescription catches very well the evolution of UV and IR luminosity functions. We note a small overproduction of the IR luminosity at low redshift ({\$}z{\textless}0.5{\$}). We also focus on the Infrared-Excess (IRX) and explore its dependency with the stellar mass, UV slope, stellar age, metallicity and slope of the attenuation curves. Our model predicts large scatters for relations based on IRX, especially for the IRX-{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} relation. Our analysis reveals that the slope of the attenuation curve is more driven by absolute attenuation in the FUV band than by disk inclination. We confirm that the age of the stellar population and the slope of the attenuation curve can both shift galaxies below the fiducial star-birth relation in the IRX-{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} diagram.},

@article{Cappellari2017,
abstract = {I start by providing an updated summary of the penalized pixel-fitting (PPXF) method that is used to extract the stellar and gas kinematics, as well as the stellar population of galaxies, via full spectrum fitting. I then focus on the problem of extracting the kinematics when the velocity dispersion s is smaller than the velocity sampling $\Delta$V that is generally, by design, close to the instrumental dispersion $\sigma$inst. The standard approach consists of convolving templates with a discretized kernel, while fitting for its parameters. This is obviously very inaccurate when $\sigma$≲ $\Delta$V /2, due to undersampling. Oversampling can prevent this, but it has drawbacks. Here I present a more accurate and efficient alternative. It avoids the evaluation of the undersampled kernel and instead directly computes its well-sampled analytic Fourier transform, for use with the convolution theorem. A simple analytic transform exists when the kernel is described by the popular Gauss-Hermite parametrization (which includes the Gaussian as special case) for the line-of-sight velocity distribution. I describe how this idea was implemented in a significant upgrade to the publicly available PPXF software. The key advantage of the new approach is that it provides accurate velocities regardless of $\sigma$. This is important e.g. for spectroscopic surveys targeting galaxies with $\sigma$ ≪$\sigma$inst, for galaxy redshift determinations or for measuring line-of-sight velocities of individual stars. The proposed method could also be used to fix Gaussian convolution algorithms used in today's popular software packages.},

abstract = {In the companion Paper XV of this series, we derive accurate total mass-to-light ratios (M/L)JAM ≈ (M/L)(r = Re) within a sphere of radius r = Re centred on the galaxy, as well as stellar (M/L)stars (with the dark matter removed) for the volume-limited and nearly massselected (stellarmassM* ≲ 6 × 109M⊙)ATLAS3D sample of 260 early-type galaxies (ETGs, ellipticals Es and lenticulars S0s). Here, we use those parameters to study the two orthogonal projections (MJAM, $\sigma$e) and (MJAM,R maje ) of the thin Mass Plane (MP) (MJAM, $\sigma$e,Rmaje ) which describes the distribution of the galaxy population, where MJAM = L × (M/L)JAM ≈ M*. The distribution of galaxy properties on both projections of the MP is characterized by: (i) the same zone of exclusion (ZOE), which can be transformed from one projection to the other using the scalar virial equation. The ZOE is roughly described by two power laws, joined by a break at a characteristic mass MJAM ≈ 3 × 1010M⊙, which corresponds to the minimum Re and maximum stellar density. This results in a break in the meanMJAM-$\sigma$e relation with trends MJAM $\alpha$ $\sigma$2.3e and MJAM $\alpha$ $\sigma$4.7e at small and large $\sigma$e, respectively; (ii) a characteristic mass MJAM ≈ 2 × 1011M⊙ which separates a population dominated by flat fast rotator with discs and spiral galaxies at lower masses, from one dominated by quite round slow rotators at larger masses; (iii) below that mass the distribution of ETGs' properties on the two projections of the MP tends to be constant along lines of roughly constant se, or equivalently along lines with Rmaje $\alpha$ MJAM, respectively (or even better parallel to the ZOE: Rmaje $\alpha$ M0.75JAM); (iv) it forms a continuous and parallel sequence with the distribution of spiral galaxies; (v) at even lower masses, the distribution of fast-rotator ETGs and late spirals naturally extends to that of dwarf ETGs (Sph) and dwarf irregulars (Im), respectively. We use dynamical models to analyse our kinematic maps. We show that $\sigma$e traces the bulge fraction, which appears to be the main driver for the observed trends in the dynamical (M/L)JAM and in indicators of the (M/L)pop of the stellar population like H$\beta$ and colour, as well as in the molecular gas fraction. A similar variation along contours of $\sigma$e is also observed for the mass normalization of the stellar initial mass function (IMF), which was recently shown to vary systematically within the ETGs' population. Our preferred relation has the form log10[(M/L)stars/(M/L)Salp] = a + b × log10($\sigma$e/130 km s-1) with a=-0.12 ± 0.01 and b = 0.35 ± 0.06. Unless there are major flaws in all stellar population models, this trend implies a transition of the mean IMF from Kroupa to Salpeter in the interval log10($\sigma$e/km s-1) ≈ 1.9-2.5 (or $\sigma$e ≈ 90-290 km s-1), with a smooth variation in between, consistently with what was shown in Cappellari et al. The observed distribution of galaxy properties on the MP provides a clean and novel view for a number of previously reported trends, which constitute special two-dimensional projections of the more general four-dimensional parameters trends on the MP. We interpret it as due to a combination of two main effects: (i) an increase of the bulge fraction, which increases $\sigma$e, decreases Re, and greatly enhance the likelihood for a galaxy to have its star formation quenched, and (ii) dry merging, increasing galaxy mass and Re by moving galaxies along lines of roughly constant $\sigma$e (or steeper), while leaving the population nearly unchanged. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

The small fraction of confirmed galaxies may indicate that the neutral fraction in the intergalactic medium rises quickly at z {\textgreater} 6.5, given that Lyman $\alpha$ is resonantly scattered by neutral gas. The small samples and limited depth of previous observations, however, makes these conclusions tentative. Here we report a deep near-infrared spectroscopic survey of 43 photometrically-selected galaxies with z {\textgreater} 6.5. We detect a near-infrared emission line from only a single galaxy, confirming that some process is making Lyman $\alpha$ difficult to detect. The detected emission line at a wavelength of 1.0343 micrometres is likely to be Lyman $\alpha$ emission, placing this galaxy at a redshift z = 7.51, an epoch 700 million years after the Big Bang. This galaxy's colours are consistent with significant metal content, implying that galaxies become enriched rapidly. We calculate a surprisingly high star-formation rate of about 330 solar masses per year, which is more than a factor of 100 greater than that seen in the Milky Way. Such a galaxy is unexpected in a survey of our size, suggesting that the early Universe may harbour a larger number of intense sites of star formation than expected.},

Our sample comprises 17 sources that had CO-based spectroscopic redshifts obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) and the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX). We detect all sources with known redshifts in either CO J=1-0 or J=2-1. Twelve sources are detected in the 7-mm continuum. The derived CO luminosities imply gas masses in the range (0.5-11)x10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}} M{\_}sun and gas depletion timescales {\textless}200 Myr, using a CO to gas mass conversion factor alpha{\_}CO=0.8 M{\_}sun (K km/s pc{\^{}}2){\^{}}{\{}-1{\}}. Combining the CO luminosities and dust masses, along with a fixed gas-to-dust ratio, we derive alpha{\_}CO factors in the range 0.4-1.8, similar to what is found in other starbursting systems. We find small scatter in alpha{\_}CO values within the sample, even though inherent variations in the spatial distribution of dust and gas in individual cases could bias the dust-based alpha{\_}CO estimates. We find that lensing magnification factors based on the CO linewidth to luminosity relation (mu{\_}CO) are highly unreliable, but particularly when mu{\textless}5. Finally, comparison of the gas and dynamical masses suggest that the average molecular gas fraction stays relatively constant at z=2-5 in the SPT DSFG sample.},

We express these criteria in terms of a density ratio or, alternatively, as an infall velocity and show that these two criteria give almost identical results. To better illustrate the implications of this definition, we applied our criteria to some prominent structures in the local Universe, the Local supercluster, Shapley supercluster, and the recently reported Laniakea supercluster to understand their future evolution. We find that for the Local and Shapley superclusters, only the central regions will collapse in the future, while Laniakea does not constitute a significant overdensity and will disperse in the future. Finally, we suggest that those superclusters that will survive the accelerating cosmic expansion and collapse in the future be called "superstes-clusters", where "superstes" means survivor in Latin, to distinguish them from traditional superclusters.},

abstract = {Cosmological simulations are crucial tools in studying the Universe, but they typically do not directly match real observed structures. Constrained cosmological simulations, on the other hand, are designed to match the observed distribution of galaxies. Here we present constrained simulations based on spectroscopic surveys at a redshift of z ≈ 2.3, corresponding to an epoch of nearly 11 Gyr ago. This allows us to ‘fast-forward' the simulation to our present day and study the evolution of observed cosmic structures self-consistently. We confirm that several previously reported protoclusters will evolve into massive galaxy clusters by our present epoch, including the ‘Hyperion' structure that we predict will collapse into a giant filamentary supercluster spanning 100 Mpc. We also discover previously unknown protoclusters with lower final masses than are typically detectable by other methods that nearly double the number of known protoclusters within this volume. Constrained simulations, applied to future high-redshift datasets, represent a unique opportunity for studying early structure formation and matching galaxy properties between high and low redshifts.},

We examine the number of spiral arms, their relative pitch angle, and the presence of a galactic bar in the disk, and show that both the slope and dispersion of the M-SFR relation is constant when varying all the above parameters. We also show that mergers (both major and minor), which represent the strongest conditions for increases in star formation at a constant mass, only boost the SFR above the main relation by {\~{}}0.3 dex; this is significantly smaller than the increase seen in merging systems at z{\textgreater}1. Of the galaxies lying significantly above the M-SFR relation in the local Universe, more than 50{\%} are mergers. We interpret this as evidence that the spiral arms, which are imperfect reflections of the galaxy's current gravitational potential, are either fully independent of the various quenching mechanisms or are completely overwhelmed by the combination of outflows and feedback. The arrangement of the star formation can be changed, but the system as a whole regulates itself even in the presence of strong dynamical forcing.},

We utilize the exceptional depth and area of the latest UltraVISTA data release, combined with the depth and unparalleled seeing of CANDELS to gather a large, mass-selected sample of galaxies in the NIR (rest-frame optical to UV).

abstract = {Context: The availability of large spectroscopic datasets has opened up the possibility of constructing large samples of rare objects in a systematic manner. Aims: The goal of this study is to analyse the properties of galaxies showing Wolf-Rayet features in their optical spectrum using spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Release 6. With this unprecedentedly large sample we aim to constrain the properties of the Wolf-Rayet phase and its impact on the surrounding interstellar medium. Methods: We carried out very careful continuum subtraction on all galaxies with equivalent widths of H$\beta${\textgreater}2 {\AA} in emission and identify Wolf-Rayet features using a mixture of automatic and visual classification. We combined this with spectroscopic and photometric information from the SDSS and derive metal abundances using a number of methods. Results: We find a total of 570 galaxies with significant Wolf-Rayet (WR) features and a further 1115 potential candidates, several times more than even the largest heterogeneously assembled catalogues. We discuss in detail the properties of galaxies showing Wolf-Rayet features with a focus on their empirical properties. We are able to accurately quantify the incidence of Wolf-Rayet galaxies with metal abundance and show that the likelihood of otherwise similar galaxies showing Wolf-Rayet features increases with increasing metallicity, but that WR features are found in galaxies of a wide range in morphology. The large sample allows us to show explicitly that there are systematic differences in the metal abundances of WR and non-WR galaxies. The most striking result is that, below EW(H$\beta$) = 100 {\AA}, Wolf-Rayet galaxies show an elevated N/O relative to non-WR galaxies. We interpret this as a rapid enrichment of the ISM from WR winds. We also show that the model predictions for WR features strongly disagree with the observations at low metallicity; while they do agree quite well with the data at solar abundances. We discuss possible reasons for this and show that models incorporating binary evolution reproduce the low-metallicity results reasonably well. Finally we combine the WR sample with a sample of galaxies with nebular He ii $\lambda$ 4686 to show that, at 12 + log O/H{\textless} 8, the main sources of He ii ionising photons appears to be O stars, arguing for a less dense stellar wind at these metallicities, while at higher abundances WN stars might increasingly dominate the ionisation budget.

Using the deep Keck/MOSFIRE and Keck/NIRES spectroscopy of these objects in the H and K bandpasses, we obtain large velocity dispersions of ∼400 km s −1 for most of the objects, which are some of the highest stellar velocity dispersions measured and ∼40{\%} larger than those measured for galaxies of similar mass at z ∼ 1.7. The sizes of these objects are also smaller by a factor of 1.5–3 compared to this same z ∼ 1.7 sample. We combine these large velocity dispersions and small sizes to obtain dynamical masses. The dynamical masses are similar to the stellar masses of these galaxies, consistent with a Chabrier initial mass function (IMF). Considered alongside previous studies of massive quiescent galaxies across 0.2 {\textless} z {\textless} 4.0, there is evidence for an evolution in the relation between the dynamical mass–stellar mass ratio and velocity dispersion as a function of redshift. This implies an IMF with fewer low-mass stars (e.g., Chabrier IMF) for massive quiescent galaxies at higher redshifts in conflict with the bottom-heavy IMF (e.g., Salpeter IMF) found in their likely z ∼ 0 descendants, though a number of alternative explanations such as a different dynamical structure or significant rotation are not ruled out. Similar to data at lower redshifts, we see evidence for an increase of IMF normalization with velocity dispersion, though the z ≳ 3 trend is steeper than that for z ∼ 0.2 early-type galaxies and offset to lower dynamical-to-stellar mass ratios.},

Sizes are derived by fitting 2D exponential disk models, with bootstrap errors averaging 20{\%}. H{\$}{\{}\backslashalpha{\}}{\$} sizes are a median (mean) of 1.19 (1.26) times larger than those of the stellar continuum, which due to radial dust gradients places an upper limit on the growth in stellar size via star formation, with just 43{\%} intrinsic scatter. At fixed continuum size the H{\$}{\{}\backslashalpha{\}}{\$} size shows no residual trend with stellar mass, star formation rate, redshift or morphology. The only significant residual trend is with the excess obscuration of H{\$}{\{}\backslashalpha{\}}{\$} by dust, at fixed continuum obscuration. The scatter in continuum size at fixed stellar mass is likely driven by the scatter in halo spin parameters. The stability of the ratio of H{\$}{\{}\backslashalpha{\}}{\$} size to continuum size demonstrates a high degree of stability in halo spin and in the transfer of angular momentum to the disk over a wide range of physical conditions and cosmic time. This may require local regulation by feedback processes. The implication of our results, as we demonstrate using a toy model, is that our upper limit on star-formation driven growth is sufficient only to evolve star-forming galaxies approximately along the observed size-mass relation, consistent with the size growth of galaxies at constant cumulative co-moving number density. To explain the observed evolution of the size-mass relation of star-forming disk galaxies other processes, such as the preferential quenching of compact galaxies or galaxy mergers, may be required.},

The largest systems we have found appear to be the extremes of the early-type galaxy population: compared to other galaxies with similar luminosities, they have the largest velocity dispersions and the smallest sizes. However, they are not distant outliers from the fundamental plane and mass-to-light scaling relations defined by the bulk of the early-type galaxy population. They may host the most massive black holes in the universe, and their abundance and properties can be used to constrain galaxy formation models. Clear outliers from the scaling relations tend to be objects in superposition (angular separations smaller than 1"), evidence for which comes sometimes from the spectra, sometimes from the images, and sometimes from both. The statistical properties of the superposed pairs, e.g., the distribution of pair separations and velocity dispersions, can be used to provide useful information about the expected distribution of image multiplicities, separations, and flux ratios due to gravitational lensing by multiple lenses, and may also constrain models of their interaction rates.},

We find that this transitionary species of galaxy is rare at all redshifts, contributing {\~{}}5{\%} of the total population at z{\~{}}2, to {\textless}1{\%} by z{\~{}}0.5. By comparing the mass functions of quiescent galaxies to post-starburst galaxies at three cosmic epochs, we show that rapid quenching of star formation can account for 100{\%} of quiescent galaxy formation, if the post-starburst spectral features are visible for {\~{}}250Myr. The flattening of the low mass end of the quiescent galaxy stellar mass function seen at z{\~{}}1 can be entirely explained by the addition of rapidly quenched galaxies. Only if a significant fraction of post-starburst galaxies have features that are visible for longer than 250Myr, or they acquire new gas and return to the star-forming sequence, can there be significant growth of the red sequence from a slower quenching route. The shape of the mass function of these transitory post-starburst galaxies resembles that of quiescent galaxies at z{\~{}}2, with a preferred stellar mass of logM{\~{}}10.6, but evolves steadily to resemble that of star-forming galaxies at z{\textless}1. This leads us to propose a dual origin for post-starburst galaxies: (1) at z{\textgreater}2 they are exclusively massive galaxies that have formed the bulk of their stars during a rapid assembly period, followed by complete quenching of further star formation, (2) at z{\textless}1 they are caused by the rapid quenching of gas-rich star-forming galaxies, independent of stellar mass, possibly due to environment and/or gas-rich major mergers.},

We have obtained 90 orbits of HST WFC3 G141 near-infrared grism spectroscopy of this field in a single pointing, as well as 142 hours of optical spectroscopy with the Very Large Telescope (VLT) Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). The WFC3 (F140W, F125W, F336W) and archival WFPC2 (F702W, F450W) imaging provides five-filter photometry that we use to detect 3,375 sources between {\$}z \backslashapprox{\$} 0 - 6, including 1,536 objects in a deep central pointing with both spectroscopic and photometric coverage. The F140W and F336W mosaics reach exceptional depths of {\$}m{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}AB{\}}\backslashapprox{\$} 28 and 29, respectively, providing near-infrared and rest-frame ultraviolet information for 1,580 sources, and we reach 5{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} continuum detections for objects as faint as {\$}m{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}AB{\}}\backslashapprox{\$} 27 in the grism spectra.

abstract = {Obtaining large samples of galaxy clusters is important for cosmology, since cluster counts as a function of redshift and mass can constrain the parameters of our Universe. They are also useful to understand the formation and evolution of clusters. We develop an improved version of the AMACFI cluster finder (now AMASCFI) and apply it to the 154 deg2 of the Canada France Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) to obtain a catalogue of 1371 cluster candidates with mass M200 {\textgreater} 10{\^{}}14 Msun and redshift z {\textless} 0.7. We derive the selection function of AMASCFI from the Millennium simulation, and cluster masses from a richness-mass scaling relation built from matching our candidates with X-ray detections. We study the evolution of these clusters with mass and redshift by computing the i'-band galaxy luminosity functions (GLFs) for the early- (ETGs) and late-type galaxies (LTGs). This sample is 90{\%} pure and 70{\%} complete, therefore our results are representative the cluster population in these redshift and mass ranges. We find an increase of both the ETG and LTG faint populations with decreasing redshift (with Schechter slopes alpha{\_}ETG = -0.65 +/- 0.03 at z=0.6 and alpha{\_}ETG = -0.79 +$\backslash$- 0.02 at z=0.2) and also a decrease of the LTG bright end, but not of the ETG's. Our large sample allows us to break the degeneracy between mass and redshift, finding that the redshift evolution is more pronounced in high-mass clusters, but that there is no significant dependence of the faint end on mass for a given redshift. These results show that the cluster red sequence is mainly formed at redshift z {\textgreater} 0.7, and that faint ETGs continue to enrich the red sequence through quenching of brighter LTGs at z {\textless} 0.7. The efficiency of this quenching is higher in large-mass clusters while the accretion rate of faint LTGs is lower as the more massive clusters have already emptied most of their environment at higher redshifts.},

abstract = {The 3D-HST and CANDELS programs have obtained WFC3 and ACS spectroscopy and imaging over five fields, comprising a total area of {\~{}}900 sq. arcmin: AEGIS, COSMOS, GOODS-North, GOODS-South, and the UKIDSS UDS field. All these fields have a wealth of publicly available imaging datasets in addition to the HST data, which makes it possible to construct the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of objects over a wide wavelength range. In this paper we describe a photometric analysis of the CANDELS and 3D-HST HST imaging and the ancillary imaging data at wavelengths 0.3um -8um. Objects were selected in the WFC3 near-IR bands, and their SEDs were determined by carefully taking the effects of the point spread function into account. A total of 147 distinct imaging datasets were used in the analysis. The photometry is made available in the form of six catalogs: one for each field, as well as a master catalog containing all objects in the entire survey. We also provide derived data products: photometric redshifts, determined with the EAZY code, and stellar population parameters determined with the FAST code. We make all the imaging data that were used in the analysis available, including our reductions of the WFC3 imaging in all five fields. 3D-HST is a spectroscopic survey with the WFC3 and ACS grisms, and the photometric catalogs presented here constitute a necessary first step in the analysis of these grism data. In a companion paper (I. Momcheva et al., in preparation) we present line diagnostics and improved redshifts from an analysis of the combination of the photometry with the grism spectra. All the data presented in this paper are available through the 3D-HST website.},

abstract = {We present new calibrations of far-ultraviolet (FUV) attenuation as derived from the total infrared to FUV luminosity ratio (IRX) and the FUV-NUV color. We find that the IRX-corrected FUV luminosities are tightly and linearly correlated with the attenuation-corrected H$\backslash$alpha$\backslash$ luminosities (as measured from the Balmer decrement), with a rms scatter of {\$}\backslashpm 0.09{\$} dex. The ratios of these attenuation-corrected FUV to H$\backslash$alpha$\backslash$ luminosities are consistent with evolutionary synthesis model predictions, assuming a constant star formation rate over 100 Myr, solar metallicity and either a Salpeter or a Kroupa IMF with lower and upper mass limits of 0.1 and 100$\backslash$msun. The IRX-corrected FUV to Balmer-corrected H$\backslash$alpha$\backslash$ luminosity ratios do not show any trend with other galactic properties over the ranges covered by our sample objects. In contrast, FUV attenuation derived from the FUV-NUV color (UV spectral slope) show much larger random and systematic uncertainties. When compared to either Balmer-corrected H$\backslash$alpha$\backslash$ luminosities or IRX-corrected FUV luminosities the color-corrected FUV luminosities show {\$}\backslashsim 2.5{\$} times larger rms scatter, and systematic nonlinear deviations as functions of luminosity and other parameters. Linear combinations of 25um and 1.4GHz radio continuum luminosities with the observed FUV luminosities are also well correlated with the Balmer-corrected H$\backslash$alpha$\backslash$ luminosities. These results provide useful prescriptions for deriving attenuation-corrected star formation rates of galaxies based on linear combinations of UV and IR or radio luminosities, which are presented in convenient tabular form. Comparisons of our calibrations with attenuation corrections in the literature and with dust attenuation laws are also made.},

Because of the nature of the two surveys (distance-limited with small baselines and deep limiting magnitudes), nearly all SNe Ia have been discovered in the sample galaxies of LOSS and BAOSS; thus, the observed peculiarity rate and luminosity function of SNe Ia are intrinsic. We find that 36{\$}\backslashpm{\$}9{\%} of nearby SNe Ia are peculiar; specifically, the luminosity function of SNe Ia consists of 20{\%} SN 1991T-like, 64{\%} normal, and 16{\%} SN 1991bg-like objects. We have compared our results to those found by earlier studies, and to those found at high redshift. The apparent dearth of SN 1991T-like objects at high redshift may be due to extinction, and especially to the difficulty of recognizing them from spectra obtained past maximum brightness or from spectra with low signal-to-noise ratios. Implications of the high peculiarity rate for the progenitor systems of SNe Ia are also briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Recent work has suggested extreme [OIII] emitting star-forming galaxies are important to reionization.

Using deep archival U-band (VLT/VIMOS) imaging of a recently confirmed overdensity at {\$}z\backslashsim3.5{\$} we calculate tight constraints on {\$}f{\_}{\{}esc{\}}{\$} for a sample (N=73) dominated by extreme [OIII] emitters.

This constraint is in agreement with recent studies of star-forming galaxies spanning {\$}z\backslashsim1-4{\$} that have found very low average {\$}f{\_}{\{}esc{\}}{\$}. Despite the galaxies in our study having an estimated average rest-frame EW([OIII]{\$}\backslashlambda5007{\$}){\$}\backslashsim400\backslashAA{\$} and [OIII]/[OII]{\$}\backslashsim 4{\$} from composite SED-fitting, we find no LyC detection, which brings into question the potential of [OIII]/[OII] as an effective probe of the LyC--a majority of LyC emitters have [OIII]/[OII]{\$}{\textgreater}3{\$}, but we establish here that [OIII]/[OII]{\$}{\textgreater}3{\$} does not guarantee significant LyC leakage for a population. Since even extreme star-forming galaxies are unable to produce the {\$}f{\_}{\{}esc{\}}\backslashsim10-15\backslash{\%}{\$} required by most theoretical calculations for star-forming galaxies to drive reionization, there must either be a rapid evolution of {\$}f{\_}{\{}esc{\}}{\$} between {\$}z\backslashsim3.5{\$} and the Epoch of Reionization, or hitherto observationally unstudied sources (e.g. ultra-faint low-mass galaxies with {\$}\backslashlog(M/M{\_}\backslashodot)\backslashsim7-8.5{\$}) must make an outsized contribution to reionization.},

abstract = {Stellar population synthesis (SPS) models are a key ingredient of many galaxy evolution studies. Unfortunately, the models are still poorly calibrated for certain stellar evolution stages. Of particular concern is the treatment of the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) phase, as different implementations lead to systematic differences in derived galaxy properties. Post-starburst galaxies are a promising calibration sample, as TP-AGB stars are thought to be most prominently visible during this phase. Here, we use post-starburst galaxies in the NEWFIRM medium-band survey to assess different SPS models. The available photometry allows the selection of a homogeneous and well-defined sample of 62 post-starburst galaxies at 0.7 z 2.0, from which we construct a well-sampled composite spectral energy distribution (SED) over the range 1200–40000 {\AA}. The SED is well fit by the Bruzual {\&} Charlot SPS models, while the Maraston models do not reproduce the rest-frame optical and near-infrared parts of the SED simultaneously. When the fitting is restricted to $\lambda$ {\textless} 6000 {\AA}, the Maraston models overpredict the near-infrared luminosity, implying that these models give too much weight to TP-AGB stars. Using the flexible SPS models by Conroy et al. and assuming solar metallicity, we find that the contribution of TP-AGB stars to the integrated SED is a factor of ∼3 lower than predicted by the latest Padova TP-AGB models. Whether this is due to lower bolometric luminosities, shorter lifetimes, and/or heavy dust obscuration of TP-AGB stars remains to be addressed. Altogether, our data demand a low contribution from TP-AGB stars to the SED of post-starburst galaxies.},

abstract = {Measurements of the UV-continuum slopes provide valuable information on the physical properties of galaxies forming in the early universe, probing the dust reddening, age, metal content, and even the escape fraction. While constraints on these slopes generally become more challenging at higher redshifts as the UV continuum shifts out of the Hubble Space Telescope bands (particularly at z{\textgreater}7), such a characterisation actually becomes abruptly easier for galaxies in the redshift window z=9.5-10.5 due to the Spitzer/IRAC 3.6um-band probing the rest-UV continuum and the long wavelength baseline between this Spitzer band and the Hubble H-band. Higher S/N constraints on the UV slope are possible at z{\~{}}10 than at z=8. Here we take advantage of this opportunity and five recently discovered bright z=9.5-10.5 galaxies to present the first measurements of the mean slope for a multi-object sample of galaxy candidates at z{\~{}}10. We find the measured observed slopes of these candidates are {\$}-2.1\backslashpm0.3\backslashpm0.2{\$} (random and systematic), only slightly bluer than the measured slopes at 3.5{\textless}z{\textless}7.5 for galaxies of similar luminosities. Small increases in the stellar ages, metallicities, and dust content of the galaxy population from z{\~{}}10 to z{\~{}}7 could easily explain the apparent evolution in slopes.},

We study how AGN host properties compare to those of normal galaxies and how they depend on L[OIII]. We find that AGN of all luminosities reside almost exclusively in massive galaxies and have distributions of sizes, stellar surface mass densities and concentrations that are similar to those of ordinary early-type galaxies in our sample. The host galaxies of low-luminosity AGN have stellar populations similar to normal early-types. The hosts of high- luminosity AGN have much younger mean stellar ages. The young stars are not preferentially located near the nucleus of the galaxy, but are spread out over scales of at least several kiloparsecs. A significant fraction of high- luminosity AGN have strong H{\$}\backslashdelta{\$} absorption-line equivalent widths, indicating that they experienced a burst of star formation in the recent past. We have also examined the stellar populations of the host galaxies of a sample of broad-line AGN. We conclude that there is no significant difference in stellar content between type 2 Seyfert hosts and QSOs with the same [OIII] luminosity and redshift. This establishes that a young stellar population is a general property of AGN with high [OIII] luminosities.},

abstract = {We study the rest-frame optical properties of 74 luminous (L{\_}bol=10{\^{}}46.2-48.2 erg/s), 1.5{\textless}z{\textless}3.5 broad-line quasars with near-IR (JHK) slit spectroscopy. Systemic redshifts based on the peak of the [OIII]5007 line reveal that redshift estimates from the rest-frame UV broad emission lines (mostly MgII) are intrinsically uncertain by {\~{}} 200 km/s (measurement errors accounted for). The overall full-width-at-half-maximum of the narrow [OIII] line is {\~{}} 1000 km/s on average. A significant fraction of the total [OIII] flux ({\~{}} 40{\%}) is in a blueshifted wing component with a median velocity offset of {\~{}} 700 km/s, indicative of ionized outflows within a few kpc from the nucleus; we do not find evidence of significant [OIII] flux beyond {\~{}} 10 kpc in our slit spectroscopy. The [OIII] line is noticeably more asymmetric and weaker than that in typical less luminous low-z quasars. However, when matched in quasar continuum luminosity, low-z quasars have similar [OIII] profiles and strengths as these high-z systems. Therefore the exceptionally large width and blueshifted wing, and the relatively weak strength of [OIII] in high-z luminous quasars are mostly a luminosity effect rather than redshift evolution. The Hbeta-[OIII] region of these high-z quasars displays a similar spectral diversity and Eigenvector 1 correlations with anti-correlated [OIII] and optical FeII strengths, as seen in low-z quasars; but the average broad Hbeta width is larger by 25{\%} than typical low-z quasars, indicating more massive black holes in these high-z systems. These results highlight the importance of understanding [OIII] emission in the general context of quasar parameter space in order to understand quasar feedback in the form of [OIII] outflows. The calibrated one-dimensional near-IR spectra are made publicly available, along with a composite spectrum.},

abstract = {According to the current understanding of cosmic structure formation, the precursors of the most massive structures in the Universe began to form shortly after the Big Bang, in regions corresponding to the largest fluctuations in the cosmic density field. Observing these structures during their period of active growth and assembly - the first few hundred million years of the Universe - is challenging because it requires surveys that are sensitive enough to detect the distant galaxies that act as signposts for these structures and wide enough to capture the rarest objects. As a result, very few such objects have been detected so far. Here we report observations of a far-infrared-luminous object at redshift 6.900 (less than 800 Myr after the Big Bang) that was discovered in a wide-field survey. High-resolution imaging reveals this source to be a pair of extremely massive star-forming galaxies. The larger of these galaxies is forming stars at a rate of 2900 solar masses per year, contains 270 billion solar masses of gas and 2.5 billion solar masses of dust, and is more massive than any other known object at a redshift of more than 6. Its rapid star formation is probably triggered by its companion galaxy at a projected separation of just 8 kiloparsecs. This merging companion hosts 35 billion solar masses of stars and has a star-formation rate of 540 solar masses per year, but has an order of magnitude less gas and dust than its neighbor and physical conditions akin to those observed in lower-metallicity galaxies in the nearby Universe. These objects suggest the presence of a dark-matter halo with a mass of more than 400 billion solar masses, making it among the rarest dark-matter haloes that should exist in the Universe at this epoch.},

abstract = {We point out a natural mechanism for quenching of star formation in early-type galaxies. It automatically links the color of a galaxy with its morphology and does not require gas consumption, removal or termination of gas supply. Given that star formation takes place in gravitationally unstable gas disks, it can be quenched when a disk becomes stable against fragmentation to bound clumps. This can result from the growth of a stellar spheroid, for instance by mergers. We present the concept of morphological quenching (MQ) using standard disk instability analysis, and demonstrate its natural occurrence in a cosmological simulation using an efficient zoom-in technique. We show that the transition from a stellar disk to a spheroid can be sufficient to stabilize the gas disk, quench star formation, and turn an early-type galaxy red and dead while gas accretion continues. The turbulence necessary for disk stability can be stirred up by sheared perturbations within the disk in the absence of bound star-forming clumps. While gas stripping processes are limited to dense groups and clusters, and other quenching mechanisms like AGN feedback, virial shock heating and gravitational heating, are limited to halos more massive than 10{\^{}}12 Mo, the MQ can explain the appearance of red ellipticals even in less massive halos and in the field. The dense gas disks observed in some of today's red ellipticals may be the relics of this mechanism, whereas red galaxies with quenched gas disks are expected to be more frequent at high redshift.},

The scientific objectives include measuring the role of environment in the evolution of low-mass galaxies, and measuring the dynamics and stellar contents of their host haloes. The targets are selected from the SpARCS, SPT, COSMOS and SXDS surveys, to be the evolutionary counterparts of today's clusters and groups.

At the same time, quiescent galaxies with the strongest H{\$}\backslashdelta{\$} absorption --- those experienced recent and rapid quenching events --- tend to be smaller than the average. These co-existing trends unify seemingly contradictory results in the literature; the complex correlations between size and age indicators revealed by our large sample of galaxies with high-quality spectra suggest that there are multiple evolutionary pathways to quiescence. Regardless of the specific physical mechanisms responsible for the cessation of star formation in massive galaxies, the large scatter in D{\$}{\_}n{\$}4000 and EW(H{\$}\backslashdelta{\$}) immediately implies that galaxies follow a large variety in evolutionary pathways. On the one hand, we see evidence for a process that slowly shuts off star-formation and transforms star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies without necessarily changing their structures.

abstract = {Context. The size of a galaxy encapsulates the signature of the diferent physical processes driving its evolution. The distribution of galaxy sizes in the Universe as a function of cosmic time is therefore a key to understand galaxy evolution. Aims. We aim to measure the average sizes and size distributions of galaxies as they are assembling before the peak in the comoving star formation rate density of the Universe to better understand the evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. Methods. We used a sample of ∼1200 galaxies in the COSMOS and ECDFS fields with confirmed spectroscopic redshifts 2 ≤ zspec ≤ 4:5 in the VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS), representative of star-forming galaxies with iAB ≤ 25. We first derived galaxy sizes by applying a classical parametric profile-fitting method using GALFIT. We then measured the total pixel area covered by a galaxy above a given surface brightness threshold, which overcomes the dificulty of measuring sizes of galaxies with irregular shapes.We then compared the results obtained for the equivalent circularized radius enclosing 100{\%} of the measured galaxy light r100 T to those obtained with the effective radius re;circ measured with GALFIT. Results.We find that the sizes of galaxies computed with our non-parametric approach span a wide range but remain roughly constant on average with a median value r100T ∼ 2:2 kpc for galaxies with 2 {\textless} z {\textless} 4:5. This is in stark contrast with the strong downward evolution of re with increasing redshift, down to sizes of {\textless}1 kpc at z ∼ 4:5. We analyze the dierence and find that parametric fitting of complex, asymmetric, multicomponent galaxies is severely underestimating their sizes. By comparing r100 T with physical parameters obtained through fitting the spectral energy distribution we find that the star-forming galaxies that are the largest at any redshift are, on average, more massive and form more stars. We discover that galaxies present more concentrated light profiles with increasing redshifts. We interpret these results as the signature of several, possibly different, evolutionary paths of galaxies in their early stages of assembly, including major and minor merging or star formation in multiple bright regions.},

Two similarly bright sources are also detected in a reanalysis of the GOODS-S data set. Three of the four galaxies in GOODS-N are significantly detected at 4.5$\sigma$-6.2$\sigma$ in the very deep Spitzer/IRAC 4.5 $\mu$m data, as is one of the GOODS-S candidates. Furthermore, the brightest of our candidates (at z = 10.2 ± 0.4) is robustly detected also at 3.6 $\mu$m (6.9$\sigma$), revealing a flat UV spectral energy distribution with a slope $\beta$ = -2.0 ± 0.2, consistent with demonstrated trends with luminosity at high redshift. Thorough testing and use of grism data excludes known low-redshift contamination at high significance, including single emission-line sources, but as-yet unknown low redshift sources could provide an alternative solution given the surprising luminosity of these candidates. Finding such bright galaxies at z ∼ 9-10 suggests that the luminosity function for luminous galaxies might evolve in a complex way at z {\textgreater} 8. The cosmic star formation rate density still shows, however, an order-of-magnitude increase from z ∼ 10 to z ∼ 8 since the dominant contribution comes from low-luminosity sources. Based on the IRAC detections, we derive galaxy stellar masses at z ∼ 10, finding that these luminous objects are typically 109 M⊗. This allows for a first estimate of the cosmic stellar mass density at z ∼ 10 resulting in log10p∗ = 4.7+0.5-0.8 M⊗ Mpc-3 for galaxies brighter than Muv ∼ -18. The remarkable brightness, and hence luminosity, of these z ∼ 9-10 candidates will enable deep spectroscopy to determine their redshift and nature, and highlights the opportunity for the James Webb Space Telescope to map the buildup of galaxies at redshifts much earlier than z ∼ 10.},

The effect on {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} due to variations in the dust composition with galaxy properties or redshift can dominate over other sources of {\$}\backslashbeta{\$} variations and is the dominant model uncertainty.

abstract = {Searching in the MaNGA IFU survey, I identify 9 galaxies that have strong Balmer absorption lines and weak nebular emission lines measured from the spectra integrated over the entire IFUs. The spectral features measured from the bulk of the stellar light make these galaxies local analogs of high-redshift spectroscopically-selected post-starburst galaxies, thus, proxies to understand the mechanisms producing post-starburst galaxies at high-redshifts. I present the distributions of absorption-line indices and emission-line strengths, as well as stellar kinematics of these local post-starburst galaxies. Almost all local post-starburst galaxies have central compact emission-line regions at the central {\$}{\textless}1{\$} kpc, mostly powered by weak star-formation activities. The age-sensitive absorption line indices EW(H{\$}\backslashdelta{\$}) and Dn4000 indicate that the stellar populations at the outskirts are older. Toy stellar population synthesis models suggest that the entire galaxies are experiencing a rapid decline of star formation with residual star-formation activities at the centers. These features demand that most post-starburst galaxies are the aftermath of highly dissipative processes that drive gas into centers, invoke centrally-concentrated star formation, then quench the galaxies. Meanwhiles, when measurable, post-starburst galaxies have the directions of maximum stellar velocity gradients align with photometric major axes, which suggest against major mergers being the principal driving mechanism, while gas-rich minor mergers are plausible. While directly obtaining the same quality of spatially-resolved spectra of high-redshift post-starburst galaxies is very difficult, finding proper local counterparts provides an alternative to understand quenching processes in the distant Universe.},

abstract = {We present the survey design, implementation, and outlook for COSMOS-Web, a 255 hour treasury program conducted by the James Webb Space Telescope in its first cycle of observations. COSMOS-Web is a contiguous 0.54 deg{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} NIRCam imaging survey in four filters (F115W, F150W, F277W, and F444W) that will reach 5{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} point source depths ranging {\$}\backslashsim{\$}27.5-28.2 magnitudes. In parallel, we will obtain 0.19 deg{\$}{\^{}}2{\$} of MIRI imaging in one filter (F770W). COSMOS-Web will build on the rich heritage of multiwavelength observations and data products available in the COSMOS field. The design of COSMOS-Web is motivated by three primary science goals: (1) to discover thousands of galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization ({\$}6{\textless}z{\textless}11{\$}) and map reionization's spatial distribution, environments, and drivers on scales sufficiently large to mitigate cosmic variance, (2) to identify hundreds of rare quiescent galaxies at {\$}z{\textgreater}4{\$} and place constraints on the formation of the Universe's most massive galaxies ({\$}M{\_}\backslashstar{\textgreater}10{\^{}}{\{}10{\}}{\$}$\backslash$,M{\$}{\_}\backslashodot{\$}), and (3) directly measure the evolution of the stellar mass to halo mass relation using weak gravitational lensing out to {\$}z\backslashsim2.5{\$} and measure its variance with galaxies' star formation histories and morphologies. In addition, we anticipate COSMOS-Web's legacy value to reach far beyond these scientific goals, touching many other areas of astrophysics, such as the identification of the first direct collapse black hole candidates, ultracool sub-dwarf stars in the Galactic halo, and possibly the identification of {\$}z{\textgreater}10{\$} pair-instability supernovae. In this paper we provide an overview of the survey's key measurements, specifications, goals, and prospects for new discovery.},

abstract = {Understanding the process of quenching is one of the major open questions in galaxy evolution, and crucial insights may be obtained by studying quenched galaxies at high redshifts, at epochs when the Universe and the galaxies were younger and simpler to model. However, establishing the degree of quiescence in high redshift galaxies is a challenging task. One notable example is Hyde, a recently discovered galaxy at z=3.709. As compact (r{\~{}}0.5 kpc) and massive (M*{\~{}}1e11 Msun) as its quenched neighbor Jekyll, it is also extremely obscured yet only moderately luminous in the sub-millimeter. Panchromatic modeling suggested it could be the first galaxy found in transition to quenching at z{\textgreater}3, however the data were also consistent with a broad range of star-formation activity, including moderate SFR in the lower scatter of the galaxy main-sequence (MS). Here, we describe ALMA observations of the [CII] 157um and [NII] 205um far-infrared emission lines. The [CII] emission within the half-light radius is dominated by ionized gas, while the outskirts are dominated by PDRs or neutral gas. This suggests that the ionization in the center is not primarily powered by on-going star formation, and could come instead from remnant stellar populations formed in an older burst, or from a moderate AGN. Accounting for this information in the multi-wavelength modeling provides a tighter constraint on the star formation rate of SFR={\$}50{\^{}}{\{}+24{\}}{\_}{\{}-18{\}}{\$} Msun/yr. This rules out fully quenched solutions, and favors SFRs more than factor of two lower than expected for a galaxy on the MS, confirming the nature of Hyde as a transition galaxy. Theses results suggest that quenching happens from inside-out, and starts before the galaxy expels or consumes all its gas reservoirs. Similar observations of a larger sample would determine whether this is an isolated case or the norm for quenching at high-redshift. [abriged]},

abstract = {A large fraction of white dwarfs (WDs) may host planets in their habitable zones. These planets may provide our best chance to detect bio-markers on a transiting exoplanet, thanks to the diminished contrast ratio between the Earth-sized WD and its Earth-sized planets. The JWST is capable of obtaining the first spectroscopic measurements of such planets, yet there are no known planets around WDs. Here we propose to take advantage of the unique capability of the Kepler spacecraft in the 2-Wheels mode to perform a transit survey that is capable of identifying the first planets in the habitable zone of a WD. We propose to obtain Kepler time-series photometry of 10,000 WDs in the SDSS imaging area to search for planets in the habitable zone. Thanks to the large field of view of Kepler, for the first time in history, a large number of WDs can be observed at the same time, which is essential for discovering transits. Our proposed survey requires a total of 200 days of observing time, and will find up to 100 planets in the WD habitable zone. This survey will maintain Kepler's spirit of searching for habitable Earths, but near new hosts. With few-day observations and minute-cadences per field, it will also open up a completely unexplored discovery space. In addition to planets, this survey is sensitive to pulsating WDs, as well as eclipsing short period stellar and substellar companions. These have important implications for constraining the double WD merger rate and their contribution to Type Ia supernovae and the gravitational wave foreground. Given the relatively low number density of our targets, this program can be combined with other projects that would benefit from high cadence and many-fields observations with Kepler, e.g. a transit survey of a magnitude-limited, complete sample of nearby M dwarfs or asteroseismology of variable stars (e.g. RR Lyrae) in the same fields.},

abstract = {In the last few years, it became possible to observationally resolve galaxies with two distinct nuclei in their centre. For separations smaller than 10 kpc, dual and offset active galactic nuclei (AGN) are distinguished: in dual AGN, both nuclei are active, whereas in offset AGN only one nucleus is active. To study the origin of such AGN pairs, we employ a cosmological, hydrodynamic simulation with a large volume of (182 Mpc)3 from the set of Magneticum Pathfinder Simulations. The simulation self-consistently produces 35 resolved black hole (BH) pairs at redshift z = 2, with a comoving distance smaller than 10 kpc. 14 of them are offset AGN and nine are dual AGN, resulting in a fraction of (1.2 ± 0.3) per cent AGN pairs with respect to the total number of AGN. In this paper, we discuss fundamental differences between the BH and galaxy properties of dual AGN, offset AGN and inactive BH pairs and investigate their different triggering mechanisms. We find that in dual AGN the BHs have similar masses and the corresponding BH from the less massive progenitor galaxy always accretes with a higher Eddington ratio. In contrast, in offset AGN the active BH is typically more massive than its non-active counterpart. Furthermore, dual AGN in general accrete more gas from the intergalactic medium than offset AGN and non-active BH pairs. This highlights that merger events, particularly minor mergers, do not necessarily lead to strong gas inflows and thus, do not always drive strong nuclear activity.},

abstract = {We take advantage of the sensitivity and resolution of Herschel at 100 and 160 micron to directly image the thermal dust emission and investigate the infrared luminosities, L(IR), and dust obscuration of typical star-forming (L*) galaxies at high redshift. Our sample consists of 146 UV-selected galaxies with spectroscopic redshifts 1.5{\textless}z{\textless}2.6 in the GOODS-North field. Supplemented with deep Very Large Array (VLA) and Spitzer imaging, we construct median stacks at the positions of these galaxies at 24, 100, and 160 micron, and 1.4 GHz. The comparison between these stacked fluxes and a variety of dust templates and calibrations implies that typical star-forming galaxies with UV luminosities L(UV){\textgreater}1e10 Lsun at z{\~{}}2 are luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) with a median L(IR)=(2.2+/-0.3)e11 Lsun. Typical galaxies at 1.5{\textless}z{\textless}2.6 have a median dust obscuration L(IR)/L(UV) = 7.1+/-1.1, which corresponds to a dust correction factor, required to recover the bolometric star formation rate (SFR) from the unobscured UV SFR, of 5.2+/-0.6. This result is similar to that inferred from previous investigations of the UV, H-alpha, 24 micron, radio, and X-ray properties of the same galaxies studied here. Stacking in bins of UV slope implies that L* galaxies with redder spectral slopes are also dustier, and that the correlation between UV slope and dustiness is similar to that found for local starburst galaxies. Hence, the rest-frame 30 and 50 micron fluxes validate on average the use of the local UV attenuation curve to recover the dust attenuation of typical star-forming galaxies at high redshift. In the simplest interpretation, the agreement between the local and high redshift UV attenuation curves suggests a similarity in the dust production and stellar and dust geometries of starburst galaxies over the last 10 billion years.},

The sample was selected in the far-IR, at $\backslash$lambda=100 and/or 160 $\backslash$mu m, and only includes galaxies with a secure H$\backslash$alpha detection (S/N{\textgreater}3). From the low resolution 3D-HST spectra we measured z and F(H$\backslash$alpha) for the whole sample, rescaling the observed flux by a constant factor of 1.2 to remove the contamination by [NII]. The stellar masses, infrared and UV luminosities were derived from the SEDs by fitting multi-band data from GALEX near-UV to SPIRE500 $\backslash$mu m. We derived the continuum extinction Estar(B-V) from both the IRX ratio and the UV-slope, and found an excellent agreement among them. Galaxies in the sample have 2.6x10{\^{}}9{\$}\backslashleq{\$}M*{\$}\backslashleq{\$}3.5x10{\^{}}11 Msun, intense infrared luminosity (L{\_}IR{\textgreater}1.2x10{\^{}}10 Lsun), high level of dust obscuration (0.1{\$}\backslashleq{\$}Estar(B-V){\$}\backslashleq{\$}1.1) and strong H$\backslash$alpha emission (typical observed fluxes Fobs(H$\backslash$alpha){\$}\backslashgeq{\$}4.1x10{\^{}}-17 erg/s/cm2).

This result could be partially due to the adopted selection criteria, picking up the most obscured but also the H$\backslash$alpha brightest sources. The derived dust correction produces a good agreement between H$\backslash$alpha and IR+UV SFRs for objects with SFR{\$}\backslashgtrsim{\$}20 Msun/yr and M*{\$}\backslashgtrsim{\$}5x10{\^{}}10 Msun, while sources with lower SFR and M* seem to require a smaller f-factor (i.e. higher H$\backslash$alpha extinction correction). Our results then imply that for our sample the nebular and optical-UV extinctions are comparable and suggest that the f-factor is a function of both M* and SFR, according with previous studies.},

abstract = {The chemical composition of galaxies has been measured out to z{\~{}}4. However, nearly all studies beyond z{\~{}}0.7 are based on strong-line emission from HII regions within star-forming galaxies. Measuring the chemical composition of distant quiescent galaxies is extremely challenging, as the required stellar absorption features are faint and shifted to near-infrared wavelengths. Here, we present ultra-deep rest-frame optical spectra of five massive quiescent galaxies at z{\~{}}1.4, all of which show numerous stellar absorption lines. We derive the abundance ratios [Mg/Fe] and [Fe/H] for three out of five galaxies; the remaining two galaxies have too young luminosity-weighted ages to yield robust measurements. Similar to lower-redshift findings, [Mg/Fe] appears positively correlated with stellar mass, while [Fe/H] is approximately constant with mass. These results may imply that the stellar mass-metallicity relation was already in place at z{\~{}}1.4. While the [Mg/Fe]-mass relation at z{\~{}}1.4 is consistent with the z{\textless}0.7 relation, [Fe/H] at z{\~{}}1.4 is {\~{}}0.2 dex lower than at z{\textless}0.7. With a [Mg/Fe] of 0.44(+0.08,-0.07) the most massive galaxy may be more alpha-enhanced than similar-mass galaxies at lower redshift, but the offset is less significant than the [Mg/Fe] of 0.6 previously found for a massive galaxy at z=2.1. Nonetheless, these results combined may suggest that [Mg/Fe] in the most massive galaxies decreases over time, possibly by accreting low-mass, less alpha-enhanced galaxies. A larger galaxy sample is needed to confirm this scenario. Finally, the abundance ratios indicate short star-formation timescales of 0.2-1.0 Gyr.},

abstract = {We have created a variety of composite quasar spectra using a homogeneous data set of over 2200 spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The quasar sample spans a redshift range of 0.044 {\textless}= z {\textless}= 4.789, and an absolute r' magnitude range of -18.0 to -26.5. The median composite covers a rest wavelength range from 800 - 8555A, and reaches a peak signal-to-noise ratio of over 300 per 1A resolution element in the rest frame. We have identified over 80 emission line features in the spectrum. Emission line peak velocity shifts of the broad permitted and semi-forbidden lines are strongly correlated with ionization energy, as previously suggested, but we find that the narrow forbidden lines are also shifted by amounts which are strongly correlated with ionization energy. The magnitude of the forbidden line shifts is {\textless} 100 km/s, compared to shifts of up to 550 km/s for some of the permitted and semi-forbidden lines. At wavelengths longer than the Ly-a emission, the continuum of the geometric mean composite is well-fit by two power-laws, with a break at approximately 5000A. The frequency power law index, alpha{\_}nu, is -0.44 from 1300 - 5000A, and -2.45 redward of about 5000A. The abrupt change in slope can be accounted for partly by host galaxy contamination at low redshift. Stellar absorption lines, including higher-order Balmer lines, seen in the composites suggest that young or intermediate age stars make a significant contribution to the light of the host galaxies. An electronic table of the median quasar template is available.},

@article{Talia2015a,
abstract = {We use a spectroscopic sample of 286 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) at 1{\textless}z{\textless}3 from the GMASS survey to study different star formation rate (SFR) estimators. Infrared (IR) data are used to derive empirical calibrations to correct ultraviolet (UV) and [OII]{\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}3727 luminosities for dust extinction and dust-corrected estimates of SFR. In the selection procedure we fully exploit the available spectroscopic information. On the basis of three continuum indices, we are able to identify and exclude from the sample galaxies in which old stellar populations might bring a non-negligible contribution to IR luminosity (LIR) and continuum reddening. Using Spitzer-MIPS and Herschel-PACS data we derive LIR for two-thirds of our sample. The LIR/LUV ratio is used as a probe of effective attenuation (AIRX) to search for correlations with continuum and spectroscopic features. The relation between AIRX and UV continuum slope ({\{}$\backslash$beta{\}}) was tested for our sample and found to be broadly consistent with the literature results at the same redshift, though with a larger dispersion with respect to UV-selected samples. We find a correlation between the rest-frame equivalent width (EW) of the [OII]{\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}3727 line and {\{}$\backslash$beta{\}}, which is the main result of this work. We therefore propose the [OII]{\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}3727 line EW as a dust attenuation probe and calibrate it through AIRX, though the assumption of a reddening curve is still needed to derive the actual attenuation towards the [OII]{\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}3727 line. We tested the issue of differential attenuation towards stellar continuum and nebular emission: our results are in line with the traditional prescription of extra attenuation towards nebular lines. A set of relations is provided that allows the recovery of the total unattenuated SFR from UV and [OII]{\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}3727 luminosities. (Abridged)},

@article{Riess1996,
abstract = {We present an empirical method that uses multicolor light-curve shapes (MLCSs) to estimate the luminosity, distance, and total line-of-sight extinction of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). The empirical correlation between the MLCSs and the luminosity is derived from a " training set" of nine SN Ia light curves with independent distance and reddening estimates. We find that intrinsically dim SN Ia's are redder and have faster light curves than the bright ones, which are slow and blue. By 35 days after maximum, the intrinsic color variations become negligible. A formal treatment of extinction employing Bayes's theorem is used to estimate the best value and its uncertainty. Applying the MLCS method to both light curves and to color curves provides enough information to determine which supernovae are dim because they are distant, which are intrinsically dim, and which are dim because of extinction by dust. The precision of the MLCS distances is examined by constructing a Hubble diagram with an independent set of 20 SN Ia's. The dispersion of 0.12 mag indicates a typical distance accuracy of 5{\%} for a single object, and the intercept yields a Hubble constant on the Sandage et al. Cepheid distance scale of H0 = 64 ± 3 (statistical) km s–1 Mpc–1 (±6 total error). The slope of 0.2010 ± 0.0035 mag over the distance interval 32.2 {\textless} $\mu$ {\textless} 38.3 yields the most precise confirmation of the linearity of the Hubble law.},
