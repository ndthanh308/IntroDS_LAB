  "abstract": "In 2008 Nico van Kampen wrote in his letter {\\it The scandal of quantum mechanics}: ``The scandal is that there are still many articles, discussions and textbooks, which advertise various interpretations and philosophical profundities.\" Not much has changed since then, while social media have given a platform for more of what Nico would term ``a scandal''. A detailed viewpoint is presented on the status of quantum mechanics, distilled from two decades of work with Armen Allahverdyan and Roger Balian on the dynamical solution of Curie-Weiss models for quantum measurement. It embodies a certain minimal form of the statistical interpretation and stays clear of ontological connections. Along the way, comments on various related subjects, terms and interpretations are given.",
