  "abstract": "The Type D asymmetric simple exclusion process (Type D ASEP) is a two-species interacting particle system exhibiting a drift, where two particles may occupy the same site only if they belong to different species. In previous research (arXiv:2011.13473), the Type D ASEP was generated using the quantum Hamiltonian corresponding to central elements from the quantum groups $\\mathcal{U}_q(\\mathfrak{so}_6)$ and $\\mathcal{U}_q(\\mathfrak{so}_8)$. We extend this construction to the case of $\\mathcal{U}_q(\\mathfrak{so}_{10})$. Additionally, we generalize a previously known duality function from arXiv:2209.11114 for the Type D ASEP for all $n$.",
