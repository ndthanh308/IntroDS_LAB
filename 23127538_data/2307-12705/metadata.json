  "abstract": "It is generally accepted that the phonon gas of a superfluid always enters a weak coupling regime at sufficiently low temperatures, whatever the strength of the interactions between the underlying particles (constitutive of the superfluid). Thus, in this limit, we should always be able to calculate the damping rate of thermal phonons by applying Fermi's golden rule to the Hamiltonian  $H_3$ of cubic phonon-phonon coupling taken from quantum hydrodynamics, at least in the case of a convex acoustic branch and in the collisionless regime (where the eigenfrequency of the considered phonons remains much greater than the gas thermalization rate). Using the many-body Green's function method, we predict that, unexpectedly, this is not true in two dimensions, contrary to the three-dimensional case. We confirm this prediction with classical phonon-field simulations and a non-perturbative theory in $H_3$, where the fourth order is regularized by hand, giving a complex energy to the virtual phonons of the four-phonon collisional processes. For a weakly interacting fluid and a phonon mode in the long-wavelength limit, we predict a damping rate about three times lower than that of the golden rule.",
