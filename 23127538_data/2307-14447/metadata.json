  "abstract": "Tunability of coherent coupling between fundamental excitations is an important prerequisite for expanding their functionality in hybrid quantum systems. In hybrid magnonics, the dipolar interaction between magnon and photon usually persists and cannot be switched off. Here, we demonstrate this capability by coupling a superconducting resonator to a layered hybrid perovskite antiferromagnet, which exhibits a magnon band gap due to its intrinsic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The pronounced temperature sensitivity of the magnon band gap location allows us to set the photon mode within the gap and to disable magnon-photon hybridization. When the resonator mode falls into the magnon band gap, the resonator damping rate increases due to the nonzero coupling to the detuned magnon mode. This phenomena can be used to quantify the magnon band gap using an analytical model. Our work brings new opportunities in controlling coherent information processing with quantum properties in complex magnetic materials.",
