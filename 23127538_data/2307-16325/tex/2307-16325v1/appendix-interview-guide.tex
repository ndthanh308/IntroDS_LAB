Can you please elaborate on your opinion regarding this statement?                                                                                      \\
		Do you expect the \sast to catch everything?                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \\
		What happens if you find something that a \sast should catch, but does not? Do you report it to the \sast developers?                                                                                                                                                                              \\
		Have you encountered any situation where any developer tried to evade \sast security checks by abusing flaws?                                                                                                                                                                                           \\
		If you ever reported a problem to \sast developers, did you ever get a response and a follow-up fix to the issue that you reported (with example)?                                                                                                                     \\
		(Previous context) What role do you think fuzzing tools play in comparison to \sasts here? Do you think fuzzing tools can replace \sasts?                                                                                                                                                          \\

		Have you ever considered designing and using an in-house \sast? What limitations of existing tools motivated you to do so?                                                                                                                                                                         \\
		If you were given unlimited resources to fix/create the perfect \sast, what issue would you address before anything else?                                                                                                                                                                          \\
