  abstract = {Laddering is a structured questioning technique derived from the repertory grid technique, enabling a hierarchy of concepts to be established. Previous empirical studies have demonstrated its utility for knowledge elicitation in two classificatory domains. In this paper, three experimental studies of laddering are described. In experiment 1, the technique was used in another classificatory domain, metallic corrosion, and the effects of repeated exposure to the technique and feedback, in the form of Pseudo-English Production Rules, were investigated. These variables had no effect on the productivity of the technique. Experiment 2 compared the laddering technique with three other techniques in a medical diagnostic domain. As in previous studies laddering was found to be the most productive technique despite the change in the type of domain about which knowledge was elicited. In experiment 3, the preferences of subjects interviewed using two versions of the laddering technique, "textual" and "graphical", were compared with those obtained when the subjects were interviewed using a computerised laddering tool. Although the "gain" obtained in the three conditions varied, the group of subjects did not prefer one type of laddering to another. The laddering tool used in the experiment was designed as one tool in an integrated Knowledge Engineering Workbench (KEW). The potential for synergy between the laddering tool and other knowledge acquisition techniques implemented within KEW is explored. Guidance and advice concerning the appropriate context to employ laddering within the knowledge acquisition process is provided.},

  abstract = {The Condorcet Jury Theorem states that majorities are more likely than any single individual to select the "better" of two alternatives when there exists uncertainty about which of the two alternatives is in fact preferred. Most extant proofs of this theorem implicitly make the behavioral assumption that individuals vote "sincerely" in the collective decision making, a seemingly innocuous assumption, given that individuals are taken to possess a common preference for selecting the better alternative. However, in the model analyzed here we find that sincere behavior by all individuals is not rational even when individuals have such a common preference. In particular, sincere voting does not constitute a Nash equilibrium. A satisfactory rational choice foundation for the claim that majorities invariably "do better" than individuals, therefore, has yet to be derived.}

  abstract = {Testing the reliability of experts should be a key element of expert interviews. Using the Condorcet Jury Theorem, it is shown that expert reliability can provide an indication of the validity of expert-opinion data. The theoretical framework is applied to expert-interview data collected in the Domestic Structures and European Integration (DOSEI) project. Special attention is paid to the role of ?leading? experts and salient issues. Evaluating the DOSEI data, the main findings are that (i) with some exceptions, there are acceptable levels of inter-expert agreement, (ii) whether the leading expert is included or not does not make a large difference to expert agreement, and (iii) experts are more in agreement on salient issues.}
