  abstract   = {Using static analysis tools for automating code inspections can be beneficial for software engineers. Such tools can make finding bugs, or software defects, faster and cheaper than manual inspections. Despite the benefits of using static analysis tools to find bugs, research suggests that these tools are underused. In this paper, we investigate why developers are not widely using static analysis tools and how current tools could potentially be improved. We conducted interviews with 20 developers and found that although all of our participants felt that use is beneficial, false positives and the way in which the warnings are presented, among other things, are barriers to use. We discuss several implications of these results, such as the need for an interactive mechanism to help developers fix defects.},

  abstract = {Shake Them All is a popular "Wallpaper" application exceeding millions of downloads on Google Play. At installation, this application is given permission to (1) access the Internet (for updating wallpapers) and (2) use the device microphone (to change background following noise changes). With these permissions, the application could silently record user conversations and upload them remotely. To give more confidence about how Shake Them All actually processes what it records, it is necessary to build a precise analysis tool that tracks the flow of any sensitive data from its source point to any sink, especially if those are in different components. Since Android applications may leak private data carelessly or maliciously, we propose IccTA, a static taint analyzer to detect privacy leaks among components in Android applications. IccTA goes beyond state-of-the-art approaches by supporting inter-component detection. By propagating context information among components, IccTA improves the precision of the analysis. IccTA outperforms existing tools on two benchmarks for ICC-leak detectors: DroidBench and ICC-Bench. Moreover, our approach detects 534 ICC leaks in 108 apps from MalGenome and 2,395 ICC leaks in 337 apps in a set of 15,000 Google Play apps.},

However, there is little public information regarding the experimental evaluation of the accuracy and value of the warnings these tools report. In this paper, we discuss the warnings found by FindBugs, a static analysis tool that finds defects in Java programs. We discuss the kinds of warnings generated and the classification of warnings into false positives, trivial bugs and serious bugs. We also provide some insight into why static analysis tools often detect true but trivial bugs, and some information about defect warnings across the development lifetime of software release. We report data on the defect warnings in Sun's Java 6 JRE, in Sun's Glassfish JEE server, and in portions of Google's Java codebase. Finally, we report on some experiences from incorporating static analysis into the software development process at Google.},

We find that the most prevalent question on SO is how to ignore and filter alerts, followed by validation of false positives. Our findings confirm prior researchers' findings related to notification communication theory as 44.6\% of the SO questions that we analyzed indicate developers face communication challenges.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have revealed that 87 \% to 96 \% of the Android apps using cryptographic APIs have a misuse which may cause security vulnerabilities. As previous studies did not conduct a qualitative examination of the validity and severity of the findings, our objective was to understand the findings in more depth. We analyzed a set of 936 open-source Java applications for cryptographic misuses. Our study reveals that 88.10 \% of the analyzed applications fail to use cryptographic APIs securely. Through our manual analysis of a random sample, we gained new insights into effective false positives. For example, every fourth misuse of the frequently misused JCA class MessageDigest is an effective false positive due to its occurrence in a non-security context. As we wanted to gain deeper insights into the security implications of these misuses, we created an extensive vulnerability model for cryptographic API misuses. Our model includes previously undiscussed attacks in the context of cryptographic APIs such as DoS attacks. This model reveals that nearly half of the misuses are of high severity, e.g., hard-coded credentials and potential Man-in-the-Middle attacks.},

Their designers trade soundness in order to increase automation, improve performance, and reduce the number of false positives or the annotation overhead. However, the impact of such design decisions on the effectiveness of an analyzer is not well understood. In this paper, we report on the first systematic effort to document and evaluate the sources of unsoundness in a static analyzer. We present a code instrumentation that reflects the sources of deliberate unsoundness in the .NET static analyzer Clousot. We have instrumented code from several open source projects to evaluate how often concrete executions violate Clousot's unsound assumptions. In our experiments, this was the case in 8\textendash 29\% of all analyzed methods. Our approach and findings can guide users of static analyzers in using them fruitfully, and designers in finding good trade-offs.},

Through these studies we have learned that many users are interested in even low priority warnings, and some organizations are building custom solutions to more seamlessly and automatically integrate FindBugs into their software processes. We've also observed that developers can make decisions about the accuracy and severity of warnings fairly quickly and independent reviewers will generally reach the same conclusions about warnings.},

  abstract = {Many threats present in smartphones are the result of interactions between application components, not just artifacts of single components. However, current techniques for identifying inter-application communication are ad hoc and do not scale to large numbers of applications. In this paper, we reduce the discovery of inter-component communication (ICC) in smartphones to an instance of the Interprocedural Distributive Environment (IDE) problem, and develop a sound static analysis technique targeted to the Android platform. We apply this analysis to 1,200 applications selected from the Play store and characterize the locations and substance of their ICC. Experiments show that full specifications for ICC can be identified for over 93\% of ICC locations for the applications studied. Further the analysis scales well; analysis of each application took on average 113 seconds to complete. Epicc, the resulting tool, finds ICC vulnerabilities with far fewer false positives than the next best tool. In this way, we develop a scalable vehicle to extend current security analysis to entire collections of applications as well as the interfaces they export.},

First, for a number of common cryptographic tasks, CogniCrypt generates code that implements the respective task in a secure manner. Currently, CogniCrypt supports tasks such as data encryption, communication over secure channels, and long-term archiving. Second, CogniCrypt continuously runs static analyses in the background to ensure a secure integration of the generated code into the developer's workspace.

This paper seeks to better understand the potential security threats posed by benign Android apps that use the SSL/TLS protocols to protect data they transmit. Since the lack of visual security indicators for SSL/TLS usage and the inadequate use of SSL/TLS can be exploited to launch Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacks, an analysis of 13,500 popular free apps downloaded from Google's Play Market is presented. We introduce MalloDroid, a tool to detect potential vulnerability against MITM attacks. Our analysis revealed that 1,074 (8.0\%) of the apps examined contain SSL/TLS code that is potentially vulnerable to MITM attacks. Various forms of SSL/TLS misuse were discovered during a further manual audit of 100 selected apps that allowed us to successfully launch MITM attacks against 41 apps and gather a large variety of sensitive data. Furthermore, an online survey was conducted to evaluate users' perceptions of certificate warnings and HTTPS visual security indicators in Android's browser, showing that half of the 754 participating users were not able to correctly judge whether their browser session was protected by SSL/TLS or not. We conclude by considering the implications of these findings and discuss several countermeasures with which these problems could be alleviated.},

This approach makes it possible to fine-tune the analysis in order to achieve a high degree of precision while still using off-the-shelf verification tools, thereby leveraging the recent advances in this field. As a matter of fact, HornDroid outperforms state-of-the-art Android static analysis tools on benchmarks proposed by the community. Moreover, HornDroid is the first static analysis tool for Android to come with a formal proof of soundness, which covers the core of the analysis technique: besides yielding correctness assurances, this proof allowed us to identify some critical corner-cases that affect the soundness guarantees provided by some of the previous static analysis tools for Android.},

We found that, with surprisingly high probabilities (90\% for Java and 71\% for Android), several types of cryptography misuse can be found in the posts, but unfortunately masked by technology-specific issues and programming concerns. We also found that cryptographic bad practices frequently occur in pairs or triples. We related triple associations to use cases and tasks, characterizing worst case scenarios of cryptography misuse. Finally, we observed that hard-to-use architectures confuse developers and contribute to perpetuate recurring errors in cryptographic programming.},

Perfecting and adding such tools to the Android development environment is an essential step in getting both security and privacy for the next generation of apps.},

  abstract = {The use of cryptography is nowadays common in software systems, with cryptographic libraries widely available to software developers. As such, the likely weakest link in sensitive software has moved from cryptographic function implementations to the application code surrounding such functions. Ordinary developers usually lack knowledge in practical cryptography, and support from specialists is rare. Frequently, these difficulties are addressed by running static analysis tools to automatically detect cryptography misuse during coding and reviews. However, the effectiveness of such tools is not yet well understood. This article studies how well programmatic misuse of cryptography is detected by free static code analysis tools. The performance of such tools in detecting misuse is correlated to coding tasks and use cases commonly found in development efforts; also, cryptography misuse is classified in comprehensive categories, easily recognizable by software security practitioners. Our research shows that the coverage of public-key cryptography by static code analysis tools is full of blind spots, because tools prioritize only those misuses related to the most frequent coding tasks and use cases, while neglecting infrequent use cases. We found that, in addition to a relatively low recall in our tests, evaluated tools also have a small overlap regarding the misuses detected by all the evaluated tools, as well as an intersection of false alarms, suggesting lack of discrimination between specific misuses and corresponding good uses of cryptography. In spite of that, well-selected tools can be useful when developing cryptographic software, but support of experts is still required for solving complex cases.},

  abstract = {Today's feature-rich smartphone apps intensively rely on access to highly sensitive (personal) data. This puts the user's privacy at risk of being violated by overly curious apps or libraries (like advertisements). Central app markets conceptually represent a first line of defense against such invasions of the user's privacy, but unfortunately we are still lacking full support for automatic analysis of apps' internal data flows and supporting analysts in statically assessing apps' behavior. In this paper we present a novel slice-optimization approach to leverage static analysis of Android applications. Building on top of precise application lifecycle models, we employ a slicing-based analysis to generate data-dependent statements for arbitrary points of interest in an application. As a result of our optimization, the produced slices are, on average, 49\% smaller than standard slices, thus facilitating code understanding and result validation by security analysts. Moreover, by re-targeting strings, our approach enables automatic assessments for a larger number of use-cases than prior work. We consolidate our improvements on statically analyzing Android apps into a tool called R-Droid and conducted a large-scale data-leak analysis on a set of 22,700 Android apps from Google Play. R-Droid managed to identify a significantly larger set of potential privacy-violating information flows than previous work, including 2,157 sensitive flows of password-flagged UI widgets in 256 distinct apps.},

API misuses, i.e., violations of these constraints, may lead to software crashes, bugs, and vulnerabilities. Though researchers developed many API-misuse detectors over the last two decades, recent studies show that API misuses are still prevalent. Therefore, we need to understand the capabilities and limitations of existing detectors in order to advance the state of the art. In this paper, we present the first-ever qualitative and quantitative evaluation that compares static API-misuse detectors along the same dimensions, and with original author validation. To accomplish this, we develop MUC, a classification of API misuses, and MUBENCHPIPE, an automated benchmark for detector comparison, on top of our misuse dataset, MUBENCH. Our results show that the capabilities of existing detectors vary greatly and that existing detectors, though capable of detecting misuses, suffer from extremely low precision and recall. A systematic root-cause analysis reveals that, most importantly, detectors need to go beyond the naive assumption that a deviation from the most-frequent usage corresponds to a misuse and need to obtain additional usage examples to train their models. We present possible directions towards more-powerful API-misuse detectors.},

  abstract = {Static analysis tools are recurrently used by developers to search for vulnerabilities in the source code of web applications. However, distinct tools provide different results depending on factors such as the complexity of the code under analysis and the application scenario; thus, missing some of the vulnerabilities while reporting false problems. Benchmarks can be used to assess and compare different systems or components, however, existing benchmarks have strong representativeness limitations, disregarding the specificities of the environment, where the tools under benchmarking will be used. In this paper, we propose a benchmark for assessing and comparing static analysis tools in terms of their capability to detect security vulnerabilities. The benchmark considers four real-world development scenarios, including workloads composed of real web applications with different goals and constraints, ranging from low budget to high-end applications. Our benchmark was implemented and assessed experimentally using a set of 134 WordPress plugins, which served as the basis for the evaluation of five free PHP static analysis tools. Results clearly show that the best solution depends on the deployment scenario and class of vulnerability being detected; therefore, highlighting the importance of these aspects in the design of the benchmark and of future static analysis tools.},

  abstract = {Cryptographic APIs (Crypto APIs) provide the foundations for the development of secure applications. Unfortunately, most applications do not use Crypto APIs securely and end up being insecure, e.g., by the usage of an outdated algorithm, a constant initialization vector, or an inappropriate hashing algorithm. Two different studies [1], [2] have recently shown that 88\% to 95\% of those applications using Crypto APIs are insecure due to misuses. To facilitate further research on these kinds of misuses, we created a collection of 201 misuses found in real-world applications along with a classification of those misuses. In the provided dataset, each misuse consists of the corresponding open-source project, the project's build information, a description of the misuse, and the misuse's location. Further, we integrated our dataset into MUBench [3], a benchmark for API misuse detection. Our dataset provides a foundation for research on Crypto API misuses. For example, it can be used to evaluate the precision and recall of detection tools, as a foundation for studies related to Crypto API misuses, or as a training set.},

  abstract = {In recent years, researchers have developed a number of tools to conduct taint analysis of Android applications. While all the respective papers aim at providing a thorough empirical evaluation, comparability is hindered by varying or unclear evaluation targets. Sometimes, the apps used for evaluation are not precisely described. In other cases, authors use an established benchmark but cover it only partially. In yet other cases, the evaluations differ in terms of the data leaks searched for, or lack a ground truth to compare against. All those limitations make it impossible to truly compare the tools based on those published evaluations.   We thus present ReproDroid, a framework allowing the accurate comparison of Android taint analysis tools. ReproDroid supports researchers in inferring the ground truth for data leaks in apps, in automatically applying tools to benchmarks, and in evaluating the obtained results. We use ReproDroid to comparatively evaluate on equal grounds the six prominent taint analysis tools Amandroid, DIALDroid, DidFail, DroidSafe, FlowDroid and IccTA. The results are largely positive although four tools violate some promises concerning features and accuracy. Finally, we contribute to the area of unbiased benchmarking with a new and improved version of the open test suite DroidBench.},

  abstract = {Due to the lack of established real-world benchmark suites for static taint analyses of Android applications, evaluations of these analyses are often restricted and hard to compare. Even in evaluations that do use real-world apps, details about the ground truth in those apps are rarely documented, which makes it difficult to compare and reproduce the results. To push Android taint analysis research forward, this paper thus recommends criteria for constructing real-world benchmark suites for this specific domain, and presents TAINTBENCH, the first real-world malware benchmark suite with documented taint flows. TAINTBENCH benchmark apps include taint flows with complex structures, and addresses static challenges that are commonly agreed on by the community. Together with the TAINTBENCH suite, we introduce the TAINTBENCH framework, whose goal is to simplify real-world benchmarking of Android taint analyses. First, a usability test shows that the framework improves experts' performance and perceived usability when documenting and inspecting taint flows. Second, experiments using TAINTBENCH reveal new insights for the taint analysis tools AMANDROID and FLOWDROID: (i) They are less effective on real-world malware apps than on synthetic benchmark apps. (ii) Predefined lists of sources and sinks heavily impact the tools' accuracy. (iii) Surprisingly, up-to-date versions of both tools are less accurate than their predecessors.},

  abstract = {Static analysis tools attempt to detect faults in code without executing it. Understanding the strengths and weaknesses of such tools, and performing direct comparisons of their effectiveness, is difficult, involving either manual examination of differing warnings on real code, or the bias-prone construction of artificial test cases. This paper proposes a novel automated approach to comparing static analysis tools, based on producing mutants of real code, and comparing detection rates over these mutants. In addition to making tool differences quantitatively observable without extensive manual effort, this approach offers a new way to detect and fix omissions in a static analysis tool's set of detectors. We present an extensive comparison of three smart contract static analysis tools, and show how our approach allowed us to add three effective new detectors to the best of these. We also evaluate popular Java and Python static analysis tools and discuss their strengths and weaknesses.},
