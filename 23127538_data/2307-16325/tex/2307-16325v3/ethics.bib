  abstract = {Researchers are faced with time-driven competitive pressures to research and publish, to achieve tenure, and to deliver on grant funding proposals. That ethical considerations can be incongruent with these incentives is neither novel nor unique to information and communication technology (ICT) research. Those conducting ICT research (ICTR) do, however, face a different breed of tensions that can impact research ethics risks. Unfortunately, institutionalized guidance on the protection of research subjects has not kept pace with the rapid transformations in information technology and infrastructure that have catalyzed changes in research substance and mechanics.},

  abstract = {This report proposes a framework for ethical guidelines for computer and information security research, based on the principles set forth in the 1979 Belmont Report, a seminal guide for ethical research in the biomedical and behavioral sciences. Despite its age, the Belmont Report’s insightful abstraction renders it a valuable cornerstone for other domains. We describe how the three principles in the Belmont report can be usefully applied in fields related to research about or involving information and communication technology.},

  abstract = {This experience report draws on over 20 years of teaching introductory ethics courses to software students. It describes a lightweight introductory quiz that has been administered to many cohorts and highlights some unexpected and persistent patterns in the quiz results. Lessons are drawn relating to the education of future software professionals, specifically on the differing professional obligations of educators and practitioners. It is concluded that software engineering education must go beyond industry needs and include topics and values that industry may not even want us to teach.},
