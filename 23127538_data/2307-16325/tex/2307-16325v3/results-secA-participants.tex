We succeeded in recruiting participants involved with a diverse range of products or services, such as web applications, anonymity networks, research software, safety-critical embedded systems, business-critical financial tech systems, and more, as illustrated in Table~\ref{tbl:interview-participants}.



All the participants in our study work on multiple projects, with a number of them working in multiple organizations.
Further, all the participants work in team(s), although the structure varies.
For instance, P01 worked in a team that maintains an Interactive Application Security Testing (IAST) product, but also used \sasts in their work.
On the other hand, P03 worked with a collection of people responsible for maintaining a popular open source anonymity protocol (\myquoteinline{It's a community run project...no corporation in control of any particular aspect of it}), and is responsible for configuring the \sast tools used by their team.




In summary, and as seen in Table~\ref{tbl:interview-participants}, the recruited participants possessed valuable, diverse experience by working in different types of projects with varying levels of security needs at their own, unique organizations.
This positioned us to further understand how productivity, in terms of feature implementation/completion, and security, in terms of ensuring that features implementations are not vulnerable, are balanced at these diverse organizations.
