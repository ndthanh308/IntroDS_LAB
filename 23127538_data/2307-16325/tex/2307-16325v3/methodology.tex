\section{Methodology}\label{sec:method}


To understand the potentially diverse perspectives of practitioners related to \sasts, we performed a two-phase study, composed of a survey, followed by in-depth, detailed interviews.
The purpose of the survey was to develop an initial understanding of the landscape, and more importantly, to guide the design of the interview protocol.
Therefore, this section (and the rest of the paper) focuses on the interviews and their qualitative analysis.
Moreover, the artifacts associated with the survey and the interview, including the informed consent forms, survey questionnaires, and the interview guide, are available in our online appendix~\cite{online-appendix}.

We now provide a brief summary of the survey protocol and results, which are further detailed in Appendix~\ref{app:online-survey} and Appendix~\ref{app:survey-results} respectively.
The interview protocol is described in Section~\ref{sec:interview-protocol}.

\subsection{Summary of the Survey Protocol and Results}
\label{sec:survey-protocol-results}
\vspace{-0.5em}
To understand how practitioners perceive and use SASTs and security tools more broadly, and how security is prioritized by individuals and organizations, we prepared an online survey questionnaire (the questionnaire is in the online appendix~\cite{online-appendix}) consisting of Likert-based questions, with optional open-ended responses to clarify their selected choice(s).
The survey protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Boards (IRBs) at the authors' universities.

\add{
We used two recruitment channels. First, we relied on {\em snowball sampling}~\cite{SnowballSamplinggoodman1961a}  from our professional networks primarily by sending invitation emails and requesting forwards to colleagues.
Second, we {\em emailed OSS developers} who had interacted with \sasts via CI/CD actions, \eg~GitHub Workflows, in open-source repositories that $(a)$~had at least one star or watcher, $(b)$ were not a fork, and $(c)$ used one of the top ten programming languages reported in GitHub Octoverse~\cite{octoverse2021}. We developed scripts that used GitHub Search APIs and crawled public repositories in Coverity Scan~\cite{coverity-scan} to find qualifying repositories. Next, we extracted email addresses from commits specific to CI/CD files (\eg {\small\texttt{.github/workflows/*.yml}}) that contained SAST names. Finally, we excluded any Github-assigned private emails and those that indicated no-reply.
\update{In the end, we contacted $1,918$ \update{OSS developers} exactly once via email.}
We discuss the ethical considerations in recruiting OSS developers in Appendix~\ref{app:ethical-oss-recruitment}.

\update{\myparagraphnew{Survey Results Overview} We received $89$ responses from the survey, of which $39$ ($18$/$39$ responses from OSS developers) were complete and valid. Of these, 35/39 worked for organizations, whereas 2 were freelancers, and 2 chose not to indicate organizational status.
We made several observations that guided the design of our interview protocol based on these valid responses.}
\update{
\textit{First}, over $83$\% ($29/35$) participants (from organizations) stated that security was of "extreme" importance to them, with an additional $17$\% ($6/35$) stating it as "very" important.
In contrast, $63$\% ($22/35$) participants identified security as of "extreme" importance from their organization's perspective, with several ($8/35$ or $23$\%) considering it "very" important.
}
This tells us that security may be prioritized differently by the organization and the individual, and more importantly, that individuals may be willing to talk about these differences, which is critical for our interviews.
\textit{Second}, participants mostly relied on a combination of automated and manual security analyses, with some exceptions.
\textit{Finally}, almost all practitioners expressed that even in the case of flaws of \sasts, their applications would be moderately impacted at most, as  they rely on multiple tools and/or manual reviews.
These observations guided our protocol design for the interview phase, which we describe next.
