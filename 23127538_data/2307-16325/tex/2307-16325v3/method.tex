\section{Methodology}\label{sec:method}



To understand the potentially diverse perspectives of practitioners related to \sasts, we performed a two-phase study, consisting of
$(a)$ a survey (Section~\ref{sec:online-survey}), that helped us develop an initial understanding and guided the $(b)$ in-depth, detailed interviews of practitioners (detailed in Section~\ref{subsec:interview-protocol}).
Figure~\ref{fig:flow-survey-interview} gives an overview of the survey and the interview approach.
We give an overview of the protocols, recruitment strategy, ethical considerations, coding and analysis in this section, and the summary of survey and interview questions in the appendices~\ref{app:survey-questions} and \ref{app:interview-guide} respectively.
Furthermore, the full details of these two phases, including the informed consent forms, survey questionnaire, and the interview guide are available in the online appendix~\cite{online-appendix}.
