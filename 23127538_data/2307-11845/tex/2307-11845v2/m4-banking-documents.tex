\section{Documents in Banking}
\label{sec:bankingdocs}

Beyond the technical aspects of foundational document analytics models, practical applications with high business value are crucial. Bank documents, distributed in multiple languages and layouts, align well with the multimodal, cross-lingual capabilities of LayoutXLM. To fully understand the potential of document analytics in banking, we now examine the complexity of its document landscape.


\subsection{Structure of Commercial Banking Business}
\label{sec:structure-banking}
The general structure of the commercial banking business is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:banking-overview}. This diagram provides an overview of the key areas within a typical bank. Banking activities are first divided into the core business and other internal operations, which are not directly related to banking-specific departments (e.g., human resources).

Although internal operations and proprietary trading are integral components of banks' activities, they are outside the scope of this study. The focus is on customer-centric core operations. While other internal operations within banks are indeed document intensive, the specificity of focusing on customer-facing processes provides a deeper understanding of the unique characteristics of the banking industry. This approach differentiates our study from more general document analytics research and allows us to directly impact process efficiency, risk management, and customer-related studies.


This study explores the core business branch of the tree, specifically the customer business, which can be further subdivided into typical banking areas. The proposed classification for these areas in banking provides a framework for understanding the activities of a commercial bank.
\citet{casu2015introduction} highlight typical components of the core customer business, including payment services, deposits, investments, lending services, e-banking, and additional financial services (e.g., insurance or trade finance). To account for contextual variations in banking activities and subprocesses, and to better align with our research focus, we propose a refined categorization:


\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Client Relationship Management.} In this domain, the focus lies on managing the bank-customer relationship, including the know-your-customer process and general customer requests.
    
    \item \textbf{Account and Transaction Services.} This segment includes the management of checking accounts and the facilitation of payment transactions. 
    
    \item \textbf{Investment and Savings Solutions.} Within this area, a diverse range of savings accounts and investment services are offered, including stock trading.
    
    \item \textbf{Credit and Lending Services.} This category encapsulates all activities related to the provision of loans and other forms of credit business. For corporate clients, this also includes specialized financing solutions, such as factoring and leasing.
    
    \item \textbf{Trade and Guarantee Services.} This area covers additional or specialized financial services such as trade finance and guarantee business, which have unique document management requirements.
\end{enumerate}

Some banks may offer additional financial and non-financial services (e.g. insurance). Our classification does not consider such services separately because they can either be embedded in one of the areas presented or fall outside the scope of core banking services.

Our contextual framework provides a clear perspective on the core business activities of commercial banks, particularly with regard to document analytics. Each area represents a distinct domain of document-intensive processes. The framework facilitates a focused exploration of the role and potential of multimodal document analytics within core banking services and serves as the guiding principle for our investigation.




\subsection{Assessment and Categorization of Banking Documents}
In order to effectively assess the characteristics of the banking documents in the areas presented, we employ certain assessment and categorization criteria. The aim is to provide a comprehensive overview to improve the understanding of each type of document and its potential for process automation.

In the course of commercial core banking, each operation or process typically requires specific documents. We have undertaken a collection of various types of documents to cover a wide range of banking areas. For example, the consumer loan approval process may involve documents such as income proofs and credit ratings.
Given the variety of documents in each area of commercial banking, we conduct an evaluation for each type of document. A systematic review of relevant literature, process documentation, practice guides, web resources, and consultations with banking domain experts provides a solid basis for this assessment. Each document type is evaluated against three key criteria:

\begin{itemize}

\item \textbf{Multimodality Assessment.} As proposed by \citet{engin2019}, different structures within the documents range from free-formatted texts to highly standardized forms. In our assessment, we consider the presence of unstructured text, tabular data or forms, and figures or images. The reason for this diversity consideration is its impact on our approach to document analytics. For example, documents that primarily consist of free text might only require the application of unimodal NLP models, and documents that are composed of images may be best served by traditional unimodal image classifiers. However, those with a mixture of text, forms, and images may require multimodal methods such as LayoutXLM.

\item \textbf{Automation Potential.} Each document is analyzed according to its potential for automation, indicating the expected impact and the ease of automating its processing. This assessment accounts for the current manual effort required to process each document and the possible benefits that could arise from automation, such as information extraction. Starting document analytics with use cases that have high automation potential can ensure efficient resource allocation and maximum return on investment.

\item \textbf{Layout Variability.} This criterion indicates how much the appearance of a particular document type can vary. If a document type always follows a strict format and appearance, its layout variability is considered low, making it easier to process. On the contrary, a document type that appears in multiple forms has a high layout variability, potentially making its processing more challenging.
The assessment of layout variability is based on an examination of multiple examples of each document type. 

\end{itemize}



Lastly, while the additional assessment of \textit{data privacy} could have been a separate criterion, we observe that almost all banking documents contain sensitive information resulting in strict privacy and security measures. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of data privacy as a critical consideration for all types of documents. However, some types of documents, such as company register extracts, may be public and less sensitive. 

These assessment criteria provide a framework for understanding the current landscape of banking documents and the opportunities they present for automation and decision support. The proposed framework lays a foundation for the effective adoption of document analytics in commercial banking operations.

These processes are covered by the five customer-centric core banking areas that we previously defined in \ref{sec:structure-banking}. It should be noted that this presentation is not exhaustive and is meant as a representative example of common processes in banks.

An important insight that emerges from Table \ref{tab:doc_assessment} concerns the inherent multimodality of banking documents. Many documents not only consist of plain text but also include various types of visual content, such as images, graphs, tables, or even handwriting. This complexity necessitates the application of multimodal models like LayoutXLM to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the document's content. Forms such as those for loan applications or account openings exemplify this characteristic. They contain tabular data, to be completed by the customer, and unstructured text. Likewise, identification documents, which are required for know-your-customer purposes, typically include personal information presented in (tabular) text format, along with photographs and signatures. In both cases, an unimodal approach that focuses solely on textual or visual data would be insufficient.


Recognizing this challenge, we take a closer look at how banks can optimally harness the potential of multimodal documents. To do this, we've identified specific use cases that not only leverage this multimodal nature but also provide concrete solutions to common banking needs. In particular, we identify three key applications: information extraction, document page classification, and document splitting, each of which has the potential to improve the efficiency of banking operations.



\paragraph{Information Extraction}
An advanced use case is the automated extraction of structured information from unstructured documents, including elements such as entity names, numeric data, and checkbox selections. For example, extracting customer details from ID documents or company information from company register extracts or annual company reports. Accurate extraction of these data enables banks to process applications or requests quickly and efficiently, reducing processing times and improving customer satisfaction.
The complexity of information extraction is closely related to the layout variability of the document type. For example, highly standardized forms, such as tax forms and identity documents, are generally easier to parse and extract information.

\paragraph{Document Page Classification}
This involves categorizing document pages into predefined document types. This is especially important when banking processes require different documents, each of which must be processed differently. By automatically identifying and then processing each type of document, banks can increase operational efficiency and ensure consistent and accurate document lifecycle management. 
This approach can be particularly beneficial for document-intensive processes such as opening an account. In this case, specific documents such as account opening forms, identity proofs, and other supporting documents can be automatically classified and routed to streamline the process.


\paragraph{Document Splitting}
Document splitting refers to the process of breaking multipage documents into smaller, more manageable segments or pages, where each segment represents a distinct sub-document. 
These sections may correspond to predefined document types, or they may represent individual units of information within a document type. For example, a compilation of monthly salary proof documents can be divided not only based on their categorization as ``salary proof", but also according to the specific month to which they correspond.
This process is, for example, required when a batch of physical documents is scanned and all pages are combined into one digital file. In this context, document splitting helps to separate and organize the collected information into individual units, making it easier to handle and process.
\\

These use cases demonstrate how document analytics can serve as a powerful tool in the banking sector. It can automate manual processes, increase accuracy, and accelerate decision-making, contributing to increased customer satisfaction and competitive advantage. Other potential applications could include document representation, visual question answering, and more, expanding the range of possibilities in this area.
