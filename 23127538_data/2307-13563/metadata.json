  "abstract": "The method of realizability was first developed by Kleene and is seen as a way to extract computational content from mathematical proofs. Traditionally, these models only satisfy intuitionistic logic, however this method was extended by Krivine to produce models which satisfy full classical logic and even Zermelo Fraenkel set theory with choice. The purpose of these notes is to produce a modified formalisation of Krivine's theory of realizability using a class of names for elements of the realizability model. It is also discussed how Krivine's method relates to the notions of intuitionistic realizability, double negation translations and the theory of forcing.",
