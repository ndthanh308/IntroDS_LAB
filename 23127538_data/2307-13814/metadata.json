  "abstract": "In this note, we present criteria that are equivalent to a locally compact Hausdorff groupoid $G$ being effective. One of these conditions is that $G$ satisfies the \"C*-algebraic local bisection hypothesis\"; that is, that every normaliser in the reduced twisted groupoid C*-algebra is supported on an open bisection. The semigroup of normalisers plays a fundamental role in our proof, as does the semigroup of normalisers in cyclic group C*-algebras.",
