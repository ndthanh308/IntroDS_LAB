\section{Conclusion}
% In this paper, we present the existence of the performance gap in traffic signal control problems and propose an uncertainty-aware grounding action transformation method (\ours) that can dynamically transform actions in the simulation with uncertainty to mitigate the discrepancy between simulated and real-world dynamics. The experiments demonstrate that \ours has an excellent performance in bridging the performance gap with higher efficiency and stability. This research is a step towards improving the real-world applicability of RL-based TSC models, 
In this paper, we identify the performance gap in traffic signal control problems and introduce \ours, an uncertainty-aware grounding action transformation method, to dynamically adapt actions in simulations. Our experiments confirm that \ours effectively reduces the performance gap with improved stability. This work represents progress in enhancing the real-world applicability of RL-based traffic signal control models, our code can be found at  \url{https://github.com/DaRL-LibSignal/UGAT.git}.
