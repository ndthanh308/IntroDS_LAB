  "abstract": "The question of whether 3-Coloring can be solved in polynomial-time for the diameter two graphs is a well-known open problem in the area of algorithmic graph theory. We study the problem restricted to graph classes that avoid cycles of given lengths as induced subgraphs. Martin et. al. [CIAC 2021] showed that the problem is polynomial-time solvable for $C_5$-free or $C_6$-free graphs, and, $(C_4,C_s)$-free graphs where $s \\in \\{3,7,8,9\\}$. We extend their result proving that it is polynomial-time solvable for $(C_4,C_s)$-free graphs, for any constant $s$, and for $(C_3,C_7)$-free graphs. Our results also hold for the more general problem List 3-Colouring.",
