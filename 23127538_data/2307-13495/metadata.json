  "abstract": "We are interested in the behavior of solutions to the damped inhomogeneous nonlinear Schrödinger equation $ i\\partial_tu+Δu+μ|x|^{-b}|u|^αu+iau=0$, $μ\\in\\mathbb{C} $, $b>0$, $a \\in \\mathbb{C}$ such that $\\Re \\textit{e}(a) \\geq 0$, $α>0$. We establish lower and upper bound estimates of the life-span. In particular for $a\\geq 0$, we obtain explicit values $a_*,\\; a^*$ such that if $a<a_*$ then blow up occurs, while for $a>a^*,$ global existence holds. Also, we prove scattering results with precise decay rates for large damping. Some of the results are new even for $b=0.$",
