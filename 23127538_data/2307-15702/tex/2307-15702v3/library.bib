            It is well known that decision methods based on pairwise rankings can suffer from a wide range of difficulties. These problems are addressed here by treating the methods as systems, where each pair is looked upon as a subsystem with an assigned task. In this manner, the source of several difficulties (including Arrow’s Theorem) is equated with the standard concern that the “whole need not be the sum of its parts.” These problems arise because the objectives assigned to subsystems need not be compatible with that of the system. Knowing what causes the difficulties leads to resolutions.},

It is shown that the Borda Count (BC) always ranks the KR winner above the KR loser, and, conversely, KR always ranks the BC winner above the BC loser. Such KR relationships fail to hold for other positional methods. The geometric reasons why KR enjoys remarkably consistent election rankings as candidates are added or dropped are explained. The power of this KR consistency is demonstrated by comparing KR and BC outcomes. But KR's consistency carries a heavy cost; it requires KR to partially dismiss the crucial "individual rationality of voters" assumption.]},

All bounds on ω since 1986 have been obtained using the so-called laser method, a way to lower-bound the ‘value’ of a tensor in designing matrix multiplication algorithms. The main result of this paper is a refinement of the laser method that improves the resulting value bound for most sufficiently large tensors. Thus, even before computing any specific values, it is clear that we achieve an improved bound on ω, and we indeed obtain the best bound on ω to date: ω {\textless} 2.37286. The improvement is of the same magnitude as the improvement that [Le Gall'14] obtained over the previous bound [Vassilevska W.'12]. Our improvement to the laser method is quite general, and we believe it will have further applications in arithmetic complexity.},

Condorcet argued that if the object of voting is to determine the “best” decision for society but voters sometimes make mistakes in their judgments, then the majority alternative (if it exists) is statistically most likely to be the best choice. Strictly speaking, this claim is not true; in some situations Bordas rule gives a sharper estimate of the best alternative. Nevertheless, Condorcet did propose a novel and statistically correct rule for finding the most likely ranking of the alternatives. This procedure, which is sometimes known as “Kemeny's rule,” is the unique social welfare function that satisfies a variant of independence of irrelevant alternatives together with several other standard properties.},

The dynamics of the group aggregation of individual decisions has been a subject of central importance in decision theory. We present here a new paradigm using an optimization framework that addresses major shortcomings that exist in current models of group ranking. Moreover, the framework provides a specific performance measure for the quality of the aggregate ranking as per its deviations from the individual decision-makers' rankings. The new model for the group-ranking problem presented here is based on rankings provided with intensity--that is, the degree of preference is quantified. The model allows for flexibility in decision protocols and can take into consideration imprecise beliefs, less than full confidence in some of the rankings, and differentiating between the expertise of the reviewers. Our approach relaxes frequently made assumptions of: certain beliefs in pairwise rankings; homogeneity implying equal expertise of all decision makers with respect to all evaluations; and full list requirement according to which each decision maker evaluates and ranks all objects. The option of preserving the ranks in certain subsets is also addressed in the model here. Significantly, our model is a natural extension and generalization of existing models, yet it is solvable in polynomial time. The group-rankings models are linked to network flow techniques.]},

	abstract = {Rank aggregation is widely used in group decision making and many other applications, where it is of interest to consolidate heterogeneous ordered lists. Oftentimes, these rankings may involve a large number of alternatives, contain ties, and/or be incomplete, all of which complicate the use of robust aggregation methods. In particular, these characteristics have limited the applicability of the aggregation framework based on the Kemeny-Snell distance, which satisfies key social choice properties that have been shown to engender improved decisions. This work introduces a binary programming formulation for the generalized Kemeny rank aggregation problem—whose ranking inputs may be complete and incomplete, with and without ties. Moreover, it leverages the equivalence of two ranking aggregation problems, namely, that of minimizing the Kemeny-Snell distance and of maximizing the Kendall-τ correlation, to compare the newly introduced binary programming formulation to a modified version of an existing integer programming formulation associated with the Kendall-τ distance. The new formulation has fewer variables and constraints, which leads to faster solution times. Moreover, we develop a new social choice property, the nonstrict extended Condorcet criterion, which can be regarded as a natural extension of the well-known Condorcet criterion and the Extended Condorcet criterion. Unlike its parent properties, the new property is adequate for handling complete rankings with ties. The property is leveraged to develop a structural decomposition algorithm, through which certain large instances of the NP-hard Kemeny rank aggregation problem can be solved exactly in a practical amount of time. To test the practical implications of the new formulation and social choice property, we work with instances constructed from a probabilistic distribution and with benchmark instances from PrefLib, a library of preference data.},

              Preference aggregation as a problem of a single consensus ranking determination, using Kemeny rule, for

              rankings, including ties, of

              alternatives is considered in the paper. The Kemeny Ranking Problem (KRP) may have considerably more than one optimal solutions (strict orders or permutations of the alternatives) and, hence, special efforts to deal with this phenomenon are needed. In the paper, there is proposed an efficient formal rule for convolution of the
              N
              multiple optimal permutations, the output profile β(
              N

              n
              ), into an exact single final consensus ranking, which can include ties. The convolution rule is as follows: in the final consensus ranking, alternatives are arranged in ascending order of their rank sums (total ranks) calculated for the output profile β; some two alternatives are considered to be tolerant if they have the same rank sums in β. The equivalent convolution rule can be also applied as follows: in the final consensus ranking, alternatives are arranged in descending order of row sums (total scores) calculated for a tournament table built for β; some two alternatives are deemed to be tolerant if they have the same row sums. It is shown that, for any alternative, its total rank and total score are equal in sum to the output profile dimension

	abstract = {A Framework to Run Personalized Promotions
            The availability of individual-level transaction data allows retailers to implement personalized operational decisions. Although such decisions have been around for several years now in online platforms, recent technological developments open new opportunities to extend similar practices to bricks-and-mortar settings (e.g., by using electronic price tags to show different prices to different customers or by using beacon-based technology to send promotion offers to targeted customers). In “Personalized Retail Promotions through a DAG-Based Representation of Customer Preferences,” Jagabathula, Mitrofanov, and Vulcano propose a back-to-back procedure for running customized promotions in retail operations contexts, from the construction of a nonparametric choice model where customer preferences are represented by directed acyclic graphs to the formulation of the promotion optimization problem. The empirical validation of their proposal on real supermarket data shows the promising performance of their approach over state-of-the-art benchmarks.
          , 
            We propose a back-to-back procedure for running personalized promotions in retail operations contexts, from the construction of a nonparametric choice model where customer preferences are represented by directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to the design of such promotions. The source data include a history of purchases tagged by customer ID jointly with product availability and promotion data for a category of products. In each customer DAG, nodes represent products and directed edges represent the relative preference order between two products. Upon arrival to the store, a customer samples a full ranking of products within the category consistent with her DAG and purchases the most preferred option among the available ones. We describe the construction process to obtain the DAGs and explain how to mount a parametric, multinomial logit model (MNL) over them. We provide new bounds for the likelihood of a DAG and show how to conduct the MNL estimation. We test our model to predict purchases at the individual level on real retail data and characterize conditions under which it outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks. Finally, we illustrate how to use the model to run personalized promotions. Our framework leads to significant revenue gains that make it an attractive candidate to be pursued in practice.},

	abstract = {Ranking problems are commonly encountered in practical applications, including order priority ranking, wine quality ranking, and piston slap noise performance ranking. The responses of these ranking applications are often considered as continuous responses, and there is uncertainty on which scoring function is used to model the responses. In this paper, we address the scoring function uncertainty of continuous response ranking problems by proposing a ranking model averaging (RMA) method. With a set of candidate models varied by scoring functions, RMA assigns weights for each model determined by a K-fold crossvalidation criterion based on pairwise loss. We provide two main theoretical properties for RMA. First, we prove that the averaging ranking predictions of RMA are asymptotically optimal in achieving the lowest possible ranking risk. Second, we provide a bound on the difference between the empirical RMA weights and theoretical optimal ones, and we show that RMA weights are consistent. Simulation results validate RMA superiority over competing methods in reducing ranking risk. Moreover, when applied to empirical examples—order priority, wine quality, and piston slap noise—RMA shows its effectiveness in building accurate ranking systems.
