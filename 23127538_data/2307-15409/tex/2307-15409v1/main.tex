%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
    Without manually annotated identities, unsupervised multi-object trackers are inferior to learning reliable feature embeddings.
    It causes the similarity-based inter-frame association stage also be error-prone, where an \textbf{uncertainty} problem arises.
    The frame-by-frame accumulated uncertainty prevents trackers from learning the consistent feature embedding against time variation.
    To avoid this uncertainty problem, recent self-supervised techniques are adopted, whereas they failed to capture temporal relations. The inter-frame uncertainty still exists.
    In fact, this paper argues that though the uncertainty problem is inevitable, it is possible to leverage the uncertainty itself to improve the learned consistency in turn.
    Specifically, an uncertainty-based metric is developed to verify and rectify the risky associations. The resulting accurate pseudo-tracklets boost learning the feature consistency.
    And accurate tracklets can incorporate temporal information into spatial transformation. This paper proposes a tracklet-guided augmentation strategy to simulate the tracklet's motion,  which adopts a hierarchical uncertainty-based sampling mechanism for hard sample mining.
    The ultimate unsupervised MOT framework, namely~\mywork, is proven effective on MOT-Challenges and VisDrone-MOT benchmark. 
    \mywork~
    achieves a SOTA performance among the published supervised and unsupervised trackers.
    %This work presents a novel unsupervised MOT framework, namely~\mywork, to alleviate these problems.

    %An uncertainty-based object association and propagation strategy is first developed to preserve the temporal consistency within the pseudo-tracklets. Then we design an anchor-based temporal-prior augmentation special for multi-object tracking, which simulates realistic motion. Together with a momentum memory dictionary that collects diverse negative samples, \mywork~effectively improves the discriminability.
