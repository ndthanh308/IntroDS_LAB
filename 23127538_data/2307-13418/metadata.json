  "abstract": "We perform a systematic classification of scalar field theories whose amplitudes admit a double copy formulation and identify two building blocks at 4-point and 13 at 5-point. Using the 4-point blocks as bootstrap seeds, this naturally leads to a single copy theory that is a gauged NLSM. Moreover, its double copy includes a novel theory that can be written in terms of Lovelock invariants of an induced metric, and includes Dirac-Born-Infeld and the special Galileon in specific limits. The amplitudes of these Goldstone modes have two distinct soft behaviour regimes, corresponding to a hybrid of non-linear symmetries.",
