abstract = {The well-known Migdal–Luttinger theorem states that the jump of the single-nucleon momentum distribution at the Fermi surface is equal to the inverse of the nucleon effective E-mass. Recent experiments studying short-range correlations (SRC) in nuclei using electron–nucleus scatterings at the Jefferson National Laboratory (JLAB) together with model calculations constrained significantly the Migdal–Luttinger jump at saturation density of nuclear matter. We show that the corresponding nucleon effective E-mass is consequently constrained to M0⁎,E/M≈2.22±0.35 in symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) and the E-mass of neutrons is smaller than that of protons in neutron-rich matter. Moreover, the average depletion of the nucleon Fermi sea increases (decreases) approximately linearly with the isospin asymmetry δ according to κp/n≈0.21±0.06±(0.19±0.08)δ for protons (neutrons). These results will help improve our knowledge about the space–time non-locality of the single-nucleon potential in neutron-rich nucleonic matter useful in both nuclear physics and astrophysics.}

abstract = {The relativistic equation of state (EOS) of the van der Waals gas is suggested and analyzed. In contrast to the usual case, the Lorentz contraction of the sphere's volume is taken into account. It is proven that the suggested EOS obeys the causality in the limit of high densities, i.e., the value of sound velocity of such a media is subluminar. The pressure obtained for the high values of chemical potential has an interesting kinetic interpretation. The suggested EOS shows that for high densities the most probable configuration corresponds to the smallest value of the relativistic excluded volume. In other words, for high densities the configurations with the collinear velocities of the neighboring hard core particles are the most probable ones. This, perhaps, may shed light on the coalescence process of any relativistic hard core constituents.}

abstract = {Nuclear systems under constraints, with high degrees of symmetries and/or collectivities may be considered as moving effectively in spaces with reduced spatial dimensions. We first derive analytical expressions for the nucleon specific energy E0(ρ), pressure P0(ρ), incompressibility coefficient K0(ρ) and skewness coefficient J0(ρ) of symmetric nucleonic matter (SNM), the quadratic symmetry energy Esym(ρ), its slope parameter L(ρ) and curvature coefficient Ksym(ρ) as well as the fourth-order symmetry energy Esym,4(ρ) of neutron-rich matter in general d spatial dimensions (abbreviated as “dD”) in terms of the isoscalar and isovector parts of the isospin-dependent single-nucleon potential according to the generalized Hugenholtz–Van Hove (HVH) theorem. The equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter in dD can be linked to that in the conventional 3-dimensional (3D) space by the ϵ-expansion which is a perturbative approach successfully used previously in treating second-order phase transitions and related critical phenomena in solid state physics and more recently in studying the EOS of cold atoms. The ϵ-expansion of nuclear EOS in dD based on a reference dimension df=d−ϵ is shown to be effective with −1≲ϵ≲1 starting from 1≲df≲3 in comparison with the exact expressions derived using the HVH theorem. Moreover, the EOS of SNM (with/without considering its potential part) is found to be reduced (enhanced) in lower (higher) dimensions, indicating in particular that the many-nucleon system tends to be more bounded but saturate at higher densities in spaces with lower dimensions. The symmetry energy perturbed from its counterpart in 3D is found to strongly depend on the momentum-dependence of the nucleon isovector potential. Moreover, the specific structure of the fourth-order symmetry energy in dD is also analyzed generally, and it is found to be naturally small, confirming the parabolic approximation for the EOS of neutron-rich matter from an even wider viewpoint. The links between the EOSs in 3D and dD spaces from the ϵ-expansion provide new perspectives to the EOS of neutron-rich matter. Further studies and potential applications of these links in nuclear physics and/or astrophysics are discussed.}

ABSTRACT = {The density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy is among the most uncertain parts of the Equation of State (EOS) of dense neutron-rich nuclear matter. It is currently poorly known especially at suprasaturation densities partially because of our poor knowledge about isovector nuclear interactions at short distances. Because of its broad impacts on many interesting issues, pinning down the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy has been a longstanding and shared goal of both astrophysics and nuclear physics. New observational data of neutron stars including their masses, radii, and tidal deformations since GW170817 have helped improve our knowledge about nuclear symmetry energy, especially at high densities. Based on various model analyses of these new data by many people in the nuclear astrophysics community, while our brief review might be incomplete and biased unintentionally, we learned in particular the following: (1) The slope parameter L of nuclear symmetry energy at saturation density ρ0 of nuclear matter from 24 new analyses of neutron star observables was about L≈57.7±19 MeV at a 68\% confidence level, consistent with its fiducial value from surveys of over 50 earlier analyses of both terrestrial and astrophysical data within error bars. (2) The curvature Ksym of nuclear symmetry energy at ρ0 from 16 new analyses of neutron star observables was about Ksym≈−107±88 MeV at a 68\% confidence level, in very good agreement with the systematics of earlier analyses. (3) The magnitude of nuclear symmetry energy at 2ρ0, i.e., Esym(2ρ0)≈51±13 MeV at a 68\% confidence level, was extracted from nine new analyses of neutron star observables, consistent with the results from earlier analyses of heavy-ion reactions and the latest predictions of the state-of-the-art nuclear many-body theories. (4) While the available data from canonical neutron stars did not provide tight constraints on nuclear symmetry energy at densities above about 2ρ0, the lower radius boundary R2.01=12.2 km from NICER’s very recent observation of PSR J0740+6620 of mass 2.08±0.07M⊙ and radius R=12.2–16.3 km at a 68\% confidence level set a tight lower limit for nuclear symmetry energy at densities above 2ρ0. (5) Bayesian inferences of nuclear symmetry energy using models encapsulating a first-order hadron–quark phase transition from observables of canonical neutron stars indicated that the phase transition shifted appreciably both L and Ksym to higher values, but with larger uncertainties compared to analyses assuming no such phase transition. (6) The high-density behavior of nuclear symmetry energy significantly affected the minimum frequency necessary to rotationally support GW190814’s secondary component of mass (2.50–2.67) M⊙ as the fastest and most massive pulsar discovered so far. Overall, thanks to the hard work of many people in the astrophysics and nuclear physics community, new data of neutron star observations since the discovery of GW170817 have significantly enriched our knowledge about the symmetry energy of dense neutron-rich nuclear matter.},

abstract = {The ultimate goal of studying isospin physics via heavy-ion reactions with neutron-rich, stable and/or radioactive nuclei is to explore the isospin dependence of in-medium nuclear effective interactions and the equation of state of neutron-rich nuclear matter, particularly the isospin-dependent term in the equation of state, i.e., the density dependence of the symmetry energy. Because of its great importance for understanding many phenomena in both nuclear physics and astrophysics, the study of the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy has been the main focus of the intermediate-energy heavy-ion physics community during the last decade, and significant progress has been achieved both experimentally and theoretically. In particular, a number of phenomena or observables have been identified as sensitive probes to the density dependence of nuclear symmetry energy. Experimental studies have confirmed some of these interesting isospin-dependent effects and allowed us to constrain relatively stringently the symmetry energy at sub-saturation densities. The impact of this constrained density dependence of the symmetry energy on the properties of neutron stars have also been studied, and they were found to be very useful for the astrophysical community. With new opportunities provided by the various radioactive beam facilities being constructed around the world, the study of isospin physics is expected to remain one of the forefront research areas in nuclear physics. In this report, we review the major progress achieved during the last decade in isospin physics with heavy ion reactions and discuss future challenges to the most important issues in this field.}

We perform relativistic ray-tracing of thermal emission from hot regions of the pulsar’s surface. We assume two distinct hot regions based on two clear pulsed components in the phase-folded pulse-profile data; we explore a number of forms (morphologies and topologies) for each hot region, inferring their parameters in addition to the stellar mass and radius. For the family of models considered, the evidence (prior predictive probability of the data) strongly favors a model that permits both hot regions to be located in the same rotational hemisphere. Models wherein both hot regions are assumed to be simply connected circular single-temperature spots, in particular those where the spots are assumed to be reflection-symmetric with respect to the stellar origin, are strongly disfavored. For the inferred configuration, one hot region subtends an angular extent of only a few degrees (in spherical coordinates with origin at the stellar center) and we are insensitive to other structural details; the second hot region is far more azimuthally extended in the form of a narrow arc, thus requiring a larger number of parameters to describe. The inferred mass M and equatorial radius Req are, respectively,  and , while the compactness  is more tightly constrained; the credible interval bounds reported here are approximately the 16\% and 84\% quantiles in marginal posterior mass.}

abstract = {Neutron stars are not only of astrophysical interest, but are also of great interest to nuclear physicists because their attributes can be used to determine the properties of the dense matter in their cores. One of the most informative approaches for determining the equation of state (EoS) of this dense matter is to measure both a star’s equatorial circumferential radius Re and its gravitational mass M. Here we report estimates of the mass and radius of the isolated 205.53 Hz millisecond pulsar PSR J0030+0451 obtained using a Bayesian inference approach to analyze its energy-dependent thermal X-ray waveform, which was observed using the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER). This approach is thought to be less subject to systematic errors than other approaches for estimating neutron star radii. We explored a variety of emission patterns on the stellar surface. Our best-fit model has three oval, uniform-temperature emitting spots and provides an excellent description of the pulse waveform observed using NICER. The radius and mass estimates given by this model are  km and  (68\%). The independent analysis reported in the companion paper by Riley et al. explores different emitting spot models, but finds spot shapes and locations and estimates of Re and M that are consistent with those found in this work. We show that our measurements of Re and M for PSR J0030+0451 improve the astrophysical constraints on the EoS of cold, catalyzed matter above nuclear saturation density.}

As a result, a measurement of its radius will provide unique insight into the properties of neutron star core matter at high densities. Here we report a radius measurement based on fits of rotating hot spot patterns to Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and X-ray Multi-Mirror (XMM-Newton) X-ray observations. We find that the equatorial circumferential radius of PSR J0740+6620 is  km (68\%). We apply our measurement, combined with the previous NICER mass and radius measurement of PSR J0030+0451, the masses of two other ∼2 M ⊙ pulsars, and the tidal deformability constraints from two gravitational wave events, to three different frameworks for equation-of-state modeling, and find consistent results at ∼1.5–5 times nuclear saturation density. For a given framework, when all measurements are included, the radius of a 1.4 M ⊙ neutron star is known to ±4\% (68\% credibility) and the radius of a 2.08 M ⊙ neutron star is known to ±5\%. The full radius range that spans the ±1σ credible intervals of all the radius estimates in the three frameworks is 12.45 ± 0.65 km for a 1.4 M ⊙ neutron star and 12.35 ± 0.75 km for a 2.08 M ⊙ neutron star.}

Our data set consists of combined pulse arrival-time measurements made with the 100 m Green Bank Telescope and the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment telescope. We explore the significance of timing-based phenomena arising from general relativistic dynamics and variations in pulse dispersion. When using various statistical methods, we find that combining ∼1.5 yr of additional, high-cadence timing data with previous measurements confirms and improves on previous estimates of relativistic effects within the PSR J0740+6620 system, with the pulsar mass  (68.3\% credibility) determined by the relativistic Shapiro time delay. For the first time, we measure secular variation in the orbital period and argue that this effect arises from apparent acceleration due to significant transverse motion. After incorporating contributions from Galactic differential rotation and off-plane acceleration in the Galactic potential, we obtain a model-dependent distance of  kpc (68.3\% credibility). This improved distance confirms the ultracool nature of the white dwarf companion determined from recent optical observations. We discuss the prospects for future observations with next-generation facilities, which will likely improve the precision on m  p  for J0740+6620 by an order of magnitude within the next few years.}

The gravitational-wave signal, GW190814, was observed during LIGO’s and Virgo’s third observing run on 2019 August 14 at 21:10:39 UTC and has a signal-to-noise ratio of 25 in the three-detector network. The source was localized to 18.5 deg2 at a distance of  Mpc; no electromagnetic counterpart has been confirmed to date. The source has the most unequal mass ratio yet measured with gravitational waves, , and its secondary component is either the lightest black hole or the heaviest neutron star ever discovered in a double compact-object system. The dimensionless spin of the primary black hole is tightly constrained to ≤0.07. Tests of general relativity reveal no measurable deviations from the theory, and its prediction of higher-multipole emission is confirmed at high confidence. We estimate a merger rate density of 1–23 Gpc−3 yr−1 for the new class of binary coalescence sources that GW190814 represents. Astrophysical models predict that binaries with mass ratios similar to this event can form through several channels, but are unlikely to have formed in globular clusters. However, the combination of mass ratio, component masses, and the inferred merger rate for this event challenges all current models of the formation and mass distribution of compact-object binaries.}

abstract = {On 2019 April 25, the LIGO Livingston detector observed a compact binary coalescence with signal-to-noise ratio 12.9. The Virgo detector was also taking data that did not contribute to detection due to a low signal-to-noise ratio, but were used for subsequent parameter estimation. The 90\% credible intervals for the component masses range from  to  (– if we restrict the dimensionless component spin magnitudes to be smaller than 0.05). These mass parameters are consistent with the individual binary components being neutron stars. However, both the source-frame chirp mass  and the total mass  of this system are significantly larger than those of any other known binary neutron star (BNS) system. The possibility that one or both binary components of the system are black holes cannot be ruled out from gravitational-wave data. We discuss possible origins of the system based on its inconsistency with the known Galactic BNS population. Under the assumption that the signal was produced by a BNS coalescence, the local rate of neutron star mergers is updated to 250–2810 .}

journal = {Journal of Instrumentation},
abstract = {This paper presents a complete description of Virgo, the French-Italian gravitational wave detector. The detector, built at Cascina, near Pisa (Italy), is a very large Michelson interferometer, with 3 km-long arms. In this paper, following a presentation of the physics requirements, leading to the specifications for the construction of the detector, a detailed description of all its different elements is given. These include civil engineering infrastructures, a huge ultra-high vacuum (UHV) chamber (about 6000 cubic metres), all of the optical components, including high quality mirrors and their seismic isolating suspensions, all of the electronics required to control the interferometer and for signal detection. The expected performances of these different elements are given, leading to an overall sensitivity curve as a function of the incoming gravitational wave frequency. This description represents the detector as built and used in the first data-taking runs. Improvements in different parts have been and continue to be performed, leading to better sensitivities. These will be detailed in a forthcoming paper.}

abstract = {To discuss properties of cold, condensed stellar objects such as neutron stars, it is necessary to know the stress tensor Tμν, the source in Einstein's field equations, from nuclear matter densities upwards. To overcome some of the difficulties with the conventional many-body approach to this problem, a model relativistic, many-body, quantum field theory composed of a baryon field, a neutral scalar meson field coupled to the scalar density ψψ, and a neutral vector meson field coupled to the conserved baryon current iΨγλψ is developed. For a uniform system of given baryon density ϱB, the linearized theory obtained by replacing the scalar and vector fields by their expectation pectation values, φ → φ0, Vλ → iδλ4V0 can be solved exactly. The resulting equation of state for nuclear matter exhibits nuclear saturation, and if the two dimensionless coupling constants in this theory are matched to the binding energy and density of nuclear matter, predictions are obtained for all other systems at all densities. In particular, neutron matter is unbound and the equation of state for neutron matter at all densities is presented; it extrapolates smoothly into the relativistic form P = ϵ. Comparison is made with some conventional many-body calculations. The full field theory is developed by expanding the fields about the condensed values φ0, V0, and the unperturbed hamiltonian is shown to correspond to the linearized theory. The energy shift due to these quantum fluctuations in the fields is related to the baryon Green's function. V0 is related directly to ϱB; φ0, however, must be determined through a self-consistency relation involving the baryon Green's function. The Feynman rules for this theory are developed. Expressions for the lowest-order contributions of the quantum fluctuations to the energy shift and φ0 are derived. It is shown that the terms qμqν in the vector-meson propagator do not contribute to these expressions, and a prescription involving assumptions on the limiting form of the theory as ϱB → 0 is presented which ensures that these lowest-order quantum fluctuations will yield finite results.}

Scattering experiments, in which a proton is knocked out of the nucleus with high-momentum transfer and high missing momentum, show that in carbon-12 the neutron-proton pairs are nearly 20 times as prevalent as proton-proton pairs and, by inference, neutron-neutron pairs. This difference between the types of pairs is due to the nature of the strong force and has implications for understanding cold dense nuclear systems such as neutron stars.}

abstract = {Atomic nuclei consist of fermions—protons and neutrons—bound together by interactions. Because two identical fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state, both protons and neutrons have a broad range of momenta inside the nucleus. Hen et al. scattered electrons off nuclei of varying sizes to study the distribution of the protons' and neutrons' momenta. Protons formed high-momentum pairs with neutrons much more frequently than with other protons. Thus, surprisingly, the average momentum of a neutron was lower than that of a proton, even in nuclei with a larger number of neutrons than protons. Science, this issue p. 614 Electron scattering off various nuclear targets is used to deduce the momentum distributions of nucleons. The atomic nucleus is composed of two different kinds of fermions: protons and neutrons. If the protons and neutrons did not interact, the Pauli exclusion principle would force the majority of fermions (usually neutrons) to have a higher average momentum. Our high-energy electron-scattering measurements using 12C, 27Al, 56Fe, and 208Pb targets show that even in heavy, neutron-rich nuclei, short-range interactions between the fermions form correlated high-momentum neutron-proton pairs. Thus, in neutron-rich nuclei, protons have a greater probability than neutrons to have momentum greater than the Fermi momentum. This finding has implications ranging from nuclear few-body systems to neutron stars and may also be observable experimentally in two-spin–state, ultracold atomic gas systems.}

ABSTRACT = {A neutron star was first detected as a pulsar in 1967. It is one of the most mysterious compact objects in the universe, with a radius of the order of 10 km and masses that can reach two solar masses. In fact, neutron stars are star remnants, a kind of stellar zombie (they die, but do not disappear). In the last decades, astronomical observations yielded various contraints for neutron star masses, and finally, in 2017, a gravitational wave was detected (GW170817). Its source was identified as the merger of two neutron stars coming from NGC 4993, a galaxy 140 million light years away from us. The very same event was detected in γ-ray, X-ray, UV, IR, radio frequency and even in the optical region of the electromagnetic spectrum, starting the new era of multi-messenger astronomy. To understand and describe neutron stars, an appropriate equation of state that satisfies bulk nuclear matter properties is necessary. GW170817 detection contributed with extra constraints to determine it. On the other hand, magnetars are the same sort of compact object, but bearing much stronger magnetic fields that can reach up to 1015 G on the surface as compared with the usual 1012 G present in ordinary pulsars. While the description of ordinary pulsars is not completely established, describing magnetars poses extra challenges. In this paper, I give an overview on the history of neutron stars and on the development of nuclear models and show how the description of the tiny world of the nuclear physics can help the understanding of the cosmos, especially of the neutron stars.}

The discussion is unified by scaling the coexistence curves in terms of these critical parameters. We study the models close to spinodal points, where they also present critical behavior. Inspired by signals of criticality shown in fragmentation experiments, we analyze two different scenarios in which such behavior would be expected: (i) the stability limits of a metastable system with vanishing external pressure; and (ii) the critical point of a gas-liquid phase equilibrium system for which the Maxwell construction applies. Spinodal and coexistence curves show the regions in which model dependence arises. Unexpectedly, this model dependence does not manifest if one calculates the thermal incompressibility of the models.}

ABSTRACT = {A review is made of constraints on the nuclear symmetry energy parameters arising from nuclear binding energy measurements, theoretical chiral effective field predictions of neutron matter properties, the unitary gas conjecture, and measurements of neutron skin thicknesses and dipole polarizabilities. While most studies have been confined to the parameters SV and L, the important roles played by, and constraints on Ksym, or, equivalently, the neutron matter incompressibility KN, are discussed. Strong correlations among SV,L, and KN are found from both nuclear binding energies and neutron matter theory. However, these correlations somewhat differ in the two cases, and those from neutron matter theory have smaller uncertainties. To 68\% confidence, it is found from neutron matter theory that SV=32.0&plusmn;1.1 MeV, L=51.9&plusmn;7.9 MeV and KN=152.2&plusmn;38.1 MeV. Theoretical predictions for neutron skin thickness and dipole polarizability measurements of the neutron-rich nuclei 48Ca, 120Sn, and 208Pb are compared to recent experimental measurements, most notably the CREX and PREX neutron skin experiments from Jefferson Laboratory. By themselves, PREX I+II measurements of 208Pb and CREX measurement of 48Ca suggest L=121&plusmn;47 MeV and L=&minus;5&plusmn;40 MeV, respectively, to 68\% confidence. However, we show that nuclear interactions optimally satisfying both measurements imply L=53&plusmn;13 MeV, nearly the range suggested by either nuclear mass measurements or neutron matter theory, and is also consistent with nuclear dipole polarizability measurements. This small parameter range implies R1.4=11.6&plusmn;1.0 km and &Lambda;1.4=228&minus;90+148, which are consistent with NICER X-ray and LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave observations of neutron stars.},

abstract = {Because of their extremely high densities, massive neutron stars can be used to test gravity. Based on spectroscopy of its white dwarf companion, Antoniadis et al. (p. 448) identified a millisecond pulsar as a neutron star twice as heavy as the Sun. The observed binary's orbital decay is consistent with that predicted by general relativity, ruling out previously untested strong-field phenomena predicted by alternative theories. The binary system has a peculiar combination of properties and poses a challenge to our understanding of stellar evolution. Observations of a pulsar confirm general relativity in the strong-field regime and reveal a perplexing stellar binary. Many physically motivated extensions to general relativity (GR) predict substantial deviations in the properties of spacetime surrounding massive neutron stars. We report the measurement of a 2.01 ± 0.04 solar mass (M☉) pulsar in a 2.46-hour orbit with a 0.172 ± 0.003 M☉ white dwarf. The high pulsar mass and the compact orbit make this system a sensitive laboratory of a previously untested strong-field gravity regime. Thus far, the observed orbital decay agrees with GR, supporting its validity even for the extreme conditions present in the system. The resulting constraints on deviations support the use of GR-based templates for ground-based gravitational wave detectors. Additionally, the system strengthens recent constraints on the properties of dense matter and provides insight to binary stellar astrophysics and pulsar recycling.}}
