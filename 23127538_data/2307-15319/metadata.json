  "abstract": "We generate compact localized states in an electrical diamond lattice, comprised of only capacitors and inductors, via local driving near its flatband frequency. We compare experimental results to numerical simulations and find very good agreement. We also examine the stub lattice, which features a flatband of a different class where neighboring compact localized states share lattice sites. We find that local driving, while exciting the lattice at that flatband frequency, is unable to isolate a single compact localized state due to their non-orthogonality. Finally, we introduce lattice nonlinearity and showcase the realization of nonlinear compact localized states in the diamond lattice. Our findings pave the way of applying flatband physics to complex electric circuit dynamics.",
