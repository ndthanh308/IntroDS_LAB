\section{100 word blurb}

We provide the first detailed experimental demonstration of tunable compact localized states (CLS) and flatbands in electric circuit networks.
CLS are unique states featuring extreme localization and are key signatures of flatbands.
We excite the circuit network through a local sinusoidal driving and observe the excitation of CLS \emph{precisely} at the flatband frequency.
Our experimental results are in excellent \emph{quantitative} agreement with theoretical modeling. 
This is a significant step to establish a versatile circuit platform for the generation and manipulation of flatbands. 
We expect these results to thus be of interest to a wide audience and deserving of publication in Phys.Rev.Lett.
