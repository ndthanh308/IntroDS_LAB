  "abstract": "Spatial search is an important problem in quantum computation, which aims to find a marked vertex on a graph. We propose a novel approach for designing deterministic quantum search algorithms on a variety of graphs via alternating quantum walks. Our approach is universal because it does not require an instance-specific analysis for different graphs. We highlight the flexibility of our approach by proving that for Johnson graphs, rook graphs, complete-square graphs and complete bipartite graphs, our quantum algorithms can find the marked vertex with $100\\%$ success probability and achieve quadratic speedups over classical algorithms. This not only gives an alternative succinct way to prove the existing results, but also leads to new interesting findings on more general graphs.",
