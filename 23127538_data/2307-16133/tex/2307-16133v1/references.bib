title = {A framework for optimal quantum spatial search using alternating phase-walks},
journal = {Quantum Science and Technology},
abstract = {We present a novel methodological framework for quantum spatial search, generalising the Childs &amp; Goldstone () algorithm via alternating applications of marked-vertex phase shifts and continuous-time quantum walks. We determine closed form expressions for the optimal walk time and phase shift parameters for periodic graphs. These parameters are chosen to rotate the system about subsets of the graph Laplacian eigenstates, amplifying the probability of measuring the marked vertex. The state evolution is asymptotically optimal for any class of periodic graphs having a fixed number of unique eigenvalues. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm by applying it to obtain  search on a variety of graphs. One important class is the n × n 3 rook graph, which has N = n 4 vertices. On this class of graphs the  algorithm performs suboptimally, achieving only  overlap after time . Using the new alternating phase-walk framework, we show that  overlap is obtained in  phase-walk iterations.}

abstract = {Grover's algorithm provides a quadratic speedup over classical algorithms to search for marked elements in an unstructured database. The original algorithm is probabilistic, and there are several schemes to achieve the deterministic version, by using the generalized Grover's iteration G(α,β):=Sr(β)So(α). However, in all the existing schemes the value range of α and β is limited; for instance, in the three early schemes they are determined by the proportion of marked states M/N. In this paper, we break through this limitation by presenting a search framework with adjustable parameters, which allows α or β to be arbitrarily given. The significance of the framework lies not only in the expansion of mathematical form, but also in its application value, as we present two disparate problems which we are able to solve deterministically using the proposed framework, whereas previous schemes are ineffective.}

The quantum algorithm is based on a continuous time quantum walk, and thus employs a different technique from previous quantum algorithms based on quantum Fourier transforms. We show how to implement the quantum walk efficiently in our black box setting. We then show how this quantum walk solves our problem by rapidly traversing a graph. Finally, we prove that no classical algorithm can solve the problem in subexponential time.},
