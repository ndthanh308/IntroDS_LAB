  "abstract": "In this work, we present a comprehensive study of the phase diagram of supersymmetric QCD with $N_{f}=N_{c}+1$ flavors perturbed by Anomaly Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (AMSB). We extend the previous analyses on s-confining ASQCD theories in three different directions. We show that the existence of the QCD-like vacuum is independent of the size of the SUSY breaking parameter. We further expand the analysis of these models by including two and three-loop contributions to investigate the robustness and limitations of the results. Finally, we include the leading effect of higher-order Kähler terms to investigate the stability of the phase diagram as we approach the confining energy scale. The analysis with higher order Kähler terms is also extended for $N_{c}=2$ for which AMSB alone gives inconclusive results.",
