\noindent 
This documentation specifies a simplified non-calibrated demographic agent-based model of the UK, a largely simplified version of the Lone Parent Model presented in \cite{Gostoli2020}. 
In the presented model, individuals of an initial population are subject to ageing, deaths, births, divorces and marriages throughout a simplified map of towns of the UK.  
The specification employs the formal terminology presented in \cite{Elsheikh2023a}. 
The main purpose of the model is to explore and exploit capabilities of the state-of-the-art Agents.jl Julia package \cite{Datseris2022} in the context of demographic modeling applications. 
Implementation is provided via the Julia package MiniDemographicABM.jl \cite{MiniDemographicABMjlMisc}.
A specific simulation is progressed with a user-defined simulation fixed step size on a hourly, daily, weekly, monthly basis or even an arbitrary user-defined clock rate. 
The model can serve for comparative studies if implemented in other agent-based modelling frameworks and programming languages.
Moreover, the model serves as a base implementation to be adjusted to realistic large-scale socio-economics, pandemics or immigration studies mainly within a demographic context.
