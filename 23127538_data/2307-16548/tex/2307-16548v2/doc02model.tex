\subsection{The space $S$}
\label{sec:model:space}


\subsubsection{Space-related model assumptions $a_{s_*}$} 

Before diving into the specification of the space $S$, it makes sense to list some related set of space-oriented assumptions. The space $ S $, cf.\ Equation \eqref{eq:space} is composed of a tuple $<H(t)~,~W>$  corresponding to the set of all houses $H(t)$ and towns $W$ implying that: 
%
\grayspass{
\label{ass:space:staticTowns} The set of towns is constant during a simulation, i.e.\ no town vanishes nor new ones get constructed:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ass:staticTowns}
    \text{ if } t_0 \leq t_1 \neq t_2 \leq t_{final} \implies W(t_1) \equiv W(t_2) \equiv W   
\end{equation}
}
\grayspass{
\label{ass:space:inhabitable}
Once a new house is built (e.g.\ to host an adult moving out of his parent's house), it never gets demolished and remains always inhabitable 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ass:HouseAlywasRemain}
    \text{ if } h \in H(t) ~\implies h \in post(H(t)) 
    \text{ where } t_0 \leq t < t_{final}
\end{equation}
}
%
Based on the space definition and the previous Equation, the following assumption is considered:
\grayspass{
%\begin{spass}
\label{ass:space:dynamicSpace}
The space is not necessarily static and particularly the set of houses can vary along the simulation time span, i.e.
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:dynamicHouses}
\text{ if } t_0 \leq t < t_{final} \implies  H(t) \subseteq post(H(t)) 
\end{equation}
%\end{spass}
}
%\item 
Consequently,
\grayspass{
\label{ass:space:dynamicHouses}
Each town $w \in W$ contains a dynamic set of of houses
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:ass:dynamicSetOfHousesInATown}
w(H^t)  \equiv  H_w^t \equiv H_w(t)  
\end{equation}   
}
%\end{enumerate}
%\begin{enumerate}[label=\boldmath$a_{s_\arabic*}$]
%\setItemnumber{4}
%\item 
%\grayspass{
%\label{ass:space:HouseBelongToATown}
%Each house $h \in H(t)$ is located in one and only one town $w \in W$%, i.e. $$town(h) = w \in W \text{ and } h \in H_w$$ 
%}
%\item 


\subsubsection{The space $S$ -- description}

In the sake of simplifying the implementation of the space,  
%\begin{spass}
%\label{ass:space:12x8}
the static set of towns of UK, cf.\ \sassnum{\ref{ass:space:staticTowns}}, is projected as a rectangular $12 \times 8$ grid with each point in the grid corresponding to a town \cite{Gostoli2020}.
%\end{spass}
% 
Formally, assuming that 
$$location(w_{(x,y)}) = (x,y) $$ 
then
% 
\begin{itemize}%[label=\textbf{S. \arabic*}]
%\setItemnumber{9}
\item the town $w_{(1,1)}$ corresponds to the north-est west-est town of UK whereas 
\item the town $w_{(12,8)}$ corresponds to the south-est east-est town of UK 
\item  the distances between towns are commonly defined, e.g.\ 
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:manhattan}
\text{manhattan-distance}(w_{(x_1,y_1)} , w_{(x_2,y_2)}) = \mid x_1 - x_2 \mid + \mid y_1 - y_2 \mid
\end{equation}
%\item 
%\label{ass:space:adjacency}
%two towns $w_{(x_1,y_1)}$ and $ w_{(x_2,y_2)}$ are adjacent (or neighbors) if 
%\begin{equation}
%\mid x_1 - x_2 \mid \leq 1  ~\text{and}~  \mid y_1 - y_2 \mid \leq 1 
%\end{equation}
\end{itemize}

The (initial) population and houses distribution within UK towns are approximated by an ad-hoc pre-given UK population density map.
The map is projected as a rectangular matrix  
%
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:M}
M  \in R^{12 \times 8} \approx 
\begin{bmatrix} 
0.0 & 0.1 & 0.2 & 0.1 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 &  0.0 \\
0.1 & 0.1 & 0.2 & 0.2 & 0.3 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\
0.0 & 0.2 & 0.2 & 0.3 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\
0.0 & 0.2 & 1.0 & 0.5 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\ 
0.4 & 0.0 & 0.2 & 0.2 & 0.4 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\
0.6 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.3 & 0.8 & 0.2 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\ 
0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.6 & 0.8 & 0.4 & 0.0 & 0.0 \\ 
0.0 & 0.0 & 0.2 & 1.0 & 0.8 & 0.6 & 0.1 & 0.0 \\ 
0.0 & 0.0 & 0.1 & 0.2 & 1.0 & 0.6 & 0.3 & 0.4 \\ 
0.0 & 0.0 & 0.5 & 0.7 & 0.5 & 1.0 & 1.0 & 0.0 \\ 
0.0 & 0.0 & 0.2 & 0.4 & 0.6 & 1.0 & 1.0 & 0.0 \\ 
0.0 & 0.2 & 0.3 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0 & 0.0
\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation} 
%

It can be observed for instance that
\begin{itemize}%[label=\textbf{S. \arabic*}]
%\setItemnumber{13}
\item 
cells with density $0$ (i.e.\ realistically, with very low-population density) don't correspond to inhabited towns  
\item 
the towns in UK are merged into 48 towns
\item e.g. the center of the capital London spans the cells $(10,6), (10,7), (11,6)$ and $ (11,7)$ 
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Further space-related assumptions}

Further assumptions are needed for specification of houses, their creation and their distributions within the UK: 
% 
\grayspass{
\label{ass:space:houseXYTown}
The static location of a house $h \in H^{[t,t_{final}]}_w$ is given in xy-coordinate of the town
\begin{equation}
location(h) = (x,y)_w \text{ where } 1 \leq x,y \leq 25    
\end{equation}
}
\grayspass{
\label{ass:space:housingUniformLocations}
The locations of houses $H_w$ within a town $w \in W$ are uniformly distributed along the x- and y- axes  
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:uniformDistHouses}
Dist(location(H_w)) \propto   (U^{[1,25]},U^{[1,25]})
\end{equation}
}
The previous equation reads the distribution is proportional to. Furthermore,
%
\grayspass{
%\begin{spass}
\label{ass:space:selectOrCreateEmptyHouse}
If an empty house $h$ is demanded in a particular town $w \in W$, an empty house is randomly selected from the set of existing empty houses $H_{w(empty)}$ in that town $w$
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:}
h_w = random(H_{w(empty)}) 
\end{equation}
If no empty house exists, a new empty house is established according to assumptions \sassnum{\ref{ass:space:housingUniformLocations}}
and \sassnum{\ref{ass:space:houseXYTown}}
%\end{spass}
}
\grayspass{
\label{ass:space:houseInArbitraryTown}
If an empty house $h$ is demanded in an arbitrary town, a town is selected via a random weighted selection, say: 
\begin{align}
\label{eq:ass:hometowLocation}
 town(h) =  random(W,M) % \text{ where } 
   % W_{xy} = \{w_{(x,y)} | w_{(x,y)} \in W \text{ and } M_{(y,x)} > 0 \}, \nonumber \\  
\end{align}
an empty house is selected or established according to the previous assumption 
}
