List of todo-s for paper 
\begin{itemize}
\item fix assumption numbers 
\item Selection of journal \comment{This is not a software paper but still it is worth to have a look at \url{https://www.software.ac.uk/which-journals-should-i-publish-my-software}}
\item abstract 
\item fix motivation and contribution highlight 
\item \sout{potential case studies}  
\item improve outlook 
\item Related works , e.g.\ related to temporal logic and verification of hybrid systems 
\item Reduce the paper contents by citing the model documentation and emphasizing the highlights 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Make an additional appendix for O.D.D?
\end{itemize}
\item Examine if it is possible to follow O.D.D-like guidelines (In an Appendix)
\item Citations 
\item Outlook: extension to this work to other type of multi agents based model (multi-level, multi clocks, dynamic scheduling etc.) 
\end{itemize}
