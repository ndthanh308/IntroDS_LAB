\noindent 
This document presents adequate formal terminology for the mathematical specification of a subset of Agent Based Models (ABMs) in the field of Demography. 
The simulation of the targeted ABMs follows a fixed-step single-clocked pattern.
The proposed terminology further improves the model
understanding and can act as a stand-alone protocol for the specification and optionally the documentation of a significant set of (demographic) ABMs.  
Nevertheless, it is imaginable the this terminology can serve as an inspiring basis for further improvement to the largely-informal widely-used model documentation and communication O.D.D.\ protocol \cite{Grimm2020,Amouroux2010} to reduce many sources of ambiguity which hinder model replications by other modelers.
A published demographic model documentation, largely simplified version of the Lone Parent Model \cite{Gostoli2020} is separately published in \cite{Elsheikh2023} as illustration for the formal terminology presented here. The model was implemented in the Julia language \cite{MiniDemographicABMjlMisc} based on the Agents.jl julia package \cite{Datseris2022}.
