\section{Discussion and Future Work}
\label{sec:con}


% % %   Conclusion
TKB Alignment is a new variant of the alignment problem that admits richer state and property descriptions. Our setting uses \alc-TKBs, CQs with \ltl operators, and a cost function for the edit operations. 
%
We have shown that TKB Alignment \wrt temporal CQs is solvable, by developing computation methods for both TKB and KB Alignment.

% % % %   Discussion
The TKB-alignment problem is closely related to abduction and to computing repairs of KBs, as these tasks also change a KB to either gain a desired consequence or remove an unwanted one. However, although being active research topics, neither of the two has yet been investigated for the temporalized setting and entailment of TCQs. Furthermore, TKB Alignment requires a cost-optimal solution, which is not very common in the context of abduction or repairs.

Interestingly, TKB Alignment can also be used for relaxing temporal CQ answering. Given a tuple of individuals $\bar{a}$ which is not a certain answer of a TCQ $\phi$, solve TKB Alignment for the Boolean TCQ obtained from $\phi'$ by assigning $\bar{a}$ to the answer variables of $\phi$. The costs computed during TKB Alignment for $\phi'$ then measure the \enquote{distance} to a certain answer of the query. 


% % %   Future Work
Our initial investigation on TKB Alignment uses a unitary cost measure for the edit operations mostly to ease presentation, as our approach can handle other cost measures easily. In this work, we did not regard rigid symbols, which are left for future work.
