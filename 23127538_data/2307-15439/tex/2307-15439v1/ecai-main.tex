%Trace alignment is a well-investigated problem underlying many AI applications. Given a trace, i.e.~a sequence of observations, and a property $\varphi$ in Linear Temporal Logic, it amounts to finding a minimal-cost modification of the trace that satisfies $\varphi$.
%While observables are typically modeled as propositions, temporal knowledge bases (TKBs) 
%written in description logics 
%%(DLs) 
%can model the temporal evolution of relational data, enriched by background knowledge,  thus facilitating more expressive modeling.
%%%
%This paper introduces a new variant of the alignment problem defined over TKBs, written in the description logic
%%the DL  
%\alc, and temporal conjunctive queries for the property $\varphi$.
%For this variant, we devise a solution 
%% \\
%technique to compute (cost-optimal) alignments of TKBs.
%%%
%%  provide computation algorithms for (cost optimal) alignments of temporal KBs.

Answering temporal CQs over temporalized Description Logic knowledge bases (TKB) is a main technique to realize ontology-based situation recognition. In case the collected data in such a knowledge base is inaccurate, important query answers can be missed. 
In this paper we introduce the TKB Alignment problem, which computes a variant of the TKB that minimally changes the TKB, but entails the given temporal CQ and is in that sense (cost-)optimal. We investigate this problem for \alc TKBs and conjunctive queries with LTL operators and devise a solution technique to compute (cost-optimal) alignments of TKBs that extends techniques for the alignment problem for propositional LTL over finite traces.
