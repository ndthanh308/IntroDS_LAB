  "abstract": "A comprehensive account of the categorical properties of the category of small categories and asymmetric delta lenses is given in the recent works of Chollet et al. and Di Meglio. An important construction for proving many of these properties is Johnson and Rosebrugh's \"pullback\" of lenses, which we call the proxy pullback of lenses. We give a new treatment of the proxy pullback in terms of compatibility, a stronger notion of commutativity for squares of lenses. The proxy pullback is sometimes, but not always, a real pullback. Using new notions of sync-minimal and independent lens spans, we characterise when a lens span that forms a commuting square with a lens cospan has a comparison lens to a proxy pullback of the cospan.",
