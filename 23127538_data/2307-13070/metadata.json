  "abstract": "The familiar trace of a square matrix generalizes to a trace of an endomorphism of a dualizable object in a symmetric monoidal category. To extend these ideas to other settings, such as modules over non-commutative rings, the trace can be generalized to a bicategory equipped with additional structure called a shadow. We propose a notion of bicategorical cotrace of certain maps involving dualizable objects in a closed bicategory equipped with a coshadow, and we use this framework to draw connections to work of Lipman on residues and traces with Hochschild (co)homology, and to work of Ganter and Kapranov on 2-representations and 2-characters.",
