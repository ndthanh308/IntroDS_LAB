  "abstract": "We demonstrate the selective control of the magnetic response and photoluminescence properties of Er3+ centers with light, by associating them with a highly conjugated beta-diketonate (1,3-di(2-naphthyl)-1,3-propanedione) ligand. We demonstrate this system to be an optically-pumped molecular compound emittingin infra-red, which can be employed as a precise heat-driving and detecting unit for low temperatures",
