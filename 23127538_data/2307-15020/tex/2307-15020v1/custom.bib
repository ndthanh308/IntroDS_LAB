    abstract = "We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).",

    abstract = "The advent of natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks for English, such as GLUE and SuperGLUE allows new NLU models to be evaluated across a diverse set of tasks. These comprehensive benchmarks have facilitated a broad range of research and applications in natural language processing (NLP). The problem, however, is that most such benchmarks are limited to English, which has made it difficult to replicate many of the successes in English NLU for other languages. To help remedy this issue, we introduce the first large-scale Chinese Language Understanding Evaluation (CLUE) benchmark. CLUE is an open-ended, community-driven project that brings together 9 tasks spanning several well-established single-sentence/sentence-pair classification tasks, as well as machine reading comprehension, all on original Chinese text. To establish results on these tasks, we report scores using an exhaustive set of current state-of-the-art pre-trained Chinese models (9 in total). We also introduce a number of supplementary datasets and additional tools to help facilitate further progress on Chinese NLU. Our benchmark is released at https://www.cluebenchmarks.com",

Furthermore based on three-stage paradigm we present a language modelnamed PPBERT. Compared with original BERT architecture that is based on the standard two-stage paradigm we do not fine-tune pre-trained model directly but rather post-train it on the domain or task related dataset first which helps to better incorporate task-awareness knowl-edge and domain-awareness knowledge within pre-trained model also from the training datasetreduce bias. Extensive experimental results indicate that proposed model improves the perfor-mance of the baselines on 24 NLP tasks which includes eight GLUE benchmarks eight Su-perGLUE benchmarks six extractive question answering benchmarks. More remarkably our proposed model is a more flexible and pluggable model where post-training approach is able to be plugged into other PLMs that are based on BERT. Extensive ablations further validate the effectiveness and its state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. The open source code pre-trained models and post-trained models are available publicly.",
