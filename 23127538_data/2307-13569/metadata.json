  "abstract": "Charge density waves (CDW) have been reported in NdNiO$_2$ and LaNiO$_2$ thin films grown on SrTiO$_3$ substrates using Ni-$L_3$ resonant x-ray scattering in Refs. [1-3]. In their comment [arXiv:2306.15086] on these reports, Pelliciari et al. found no evidence for a CDW in a NdNiO$_2$ film by performing fixed-momentum energy-dependent measurements. Instead, they observed a nearby non-resonant scattering peak, attributed to the (101) substrate reflection, made accessible at Ni-$L_3$ due to third harmonic light contamination. Here we present fixed-momentum energy-dependent resonant inelastic x-ray scattering measurements across Ni-$L_3$ on NdNiO$_2$, used in the preceding study [1]. We see intrinsic Ni-$L_3$ energy profiles at all measured \\textbf{Q} values, including a strong resonance effect at $\\mathbf{Q}_\\mathrm{CDW} = (-1/3, 0, 0.316)$ reciprocal lattice units. Attempts to measure the (101) substrate peak using third harmonic light at Ni-$L_3$ at I21, Diamond were unfruitful. Our results clearly demonstrate the electronic origin of the scattering peak published in Ref. [1] and lack of a detectable structural component in the peak.",
