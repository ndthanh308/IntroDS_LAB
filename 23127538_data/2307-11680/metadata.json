  "abstract": "Let ${\\cal M}$ denote the Bose--Mesner algebra of a commutative $d$-class association scheme ${\\mathfrak X}$ (not necessarily symmetric), and $Γ$ denote a (strongly) connected (directed) graph with adjacency matrix $A$. Under the assumption that $A$ belongs to ${\\cal M}$, we describe the combinatorial structure of $Γ$. Moreover, we provide an algebraic-combinatorial characterization of $Γ$ when $A$ generates ${\\cal M}$.\n  Among else, we show that, if ${\\mathfrak X}$ is a commutative $3$-class association scheme that is not an amorphic symmetric scheme, then we can always find a (directed) graph $Γ$ such that the adjacency matrix $A$ of $Γ$ generates the Bose--Mesner algebra ${\\cal M}$ of ${\\mathfrak X}$.",
