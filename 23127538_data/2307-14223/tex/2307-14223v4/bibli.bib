  abstract =      {While recent progress in quantum hardware open the
                   door for significant speedup in certain key areas,
                   quantum algorithms are still hard to implement right,
                   and the validation of such quantum programs is a
                   challenge. In this paper we propose Qbricks, a formal
                   verification environment for circuit-building quantum
                   programs, featuring both parametric specifications
                   and a high degree of proof automation. We propose a
                   logical framework based on first-order logic, and
                   develop the main tool we rely upon for achieving the
                   automation of proofs of quantum specification: PPS, a
                   parametric extension of the recently developed path
                   sum semantics. To back-up our claims, we implement
                   and verify parametric versions of several famous and
                   non-trivial quantum algorithms, including the quantum
                   parts of Shor's integer factoring, quantum phase
                   estimation (QPE) and Grover's search.},

  abstract =      {Diagrammatic techniques for reasoning about monoidal
                   categories provide an intuitive understanding of the
                   symmetries and connections of interacting
                   computational processes. In the context of
                   categorical quantum mechanics, Coecke and Kissinger
                   suggested that two 3-qubit states, GHZ and W, may be
                   used as the building blocks of a new graphical
                   calculus, aimed at a diagrammatic classification of
                   multipartite qubit entanglement that would highlight
                   the communicational properties of quantum states, and
                   their potential uses in cryptographic schemes. In
                   this paper, we present a full graphical
                   axiomatisation of the relations between GHZ and W:
                   the ZW calculus. This refines a version of the
                   preexisting ZX calculus, while keeping its most
                   desirable characteristics: undirected ness, a large
                   degree of symmetry, and an algebraic underpinning. We
                   prove that the ZW calculus is complete for the
                   category of free abelian groups on a power of two
                   generators - "qubits with integer coefficients" - and
