  "abstract": "Astrophysical neutrinos detected by the IceCube observatory can be of Galactic or extragalactic origin. The collective contribution of all the detected neutrinos allows us to measure the total diffuse neutrino Galactic and extragalactic signal. In this work, we describe a simulation package that makes use of this diffuse Galactic contribution information to simulate a population of Galactic sources distributed in a manner similar to our own galaxy. This is then compared with the sensitivities reported by different IceCube data samples to estimate the number of sources that IceCube can detect. We provide the results of the simulation that allows us to make statements about the nature of the sources contributing to the IceCube diffuse signal.",
