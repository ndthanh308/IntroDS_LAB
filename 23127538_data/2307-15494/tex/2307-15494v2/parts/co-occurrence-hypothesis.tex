In Section~\ref{subsec:co-occurrence}, we hypothesised that, upon specifiying a goal, agent observations would be biased to contain semantic components present in said goal. 
We tested this hypothesis in the BabyAI environment and provided some examples in Figure~\ref{fig:co_occurrence}, when the linguistic goal description was ``Pick up the green key'', showing that the semantics of the goal (colour ``green'' and shape ``key'') are some of the most salient observed semantics in the environment's observations of both expert trajectories and random walks.

Here, we provide further evidence that the linguistic goal description aligns with the observed semantics across different permutations of color goal and shape goal. As described in the main body text, this is consistent across both agents, but more visible in the expert agent. Figures \ref{fig:appendix_co_occurrence_none}, \ref{fig:appendix_co_occurrence_green}, \ref{fig:appendix_co_occurrence_blue}, \ref{fig:appendix_co_occurrence_grey}, \ref{fig:appendix_co_occurrence_purple}, \ref{fig:appendix_co_occurrence_red}, and \ref{fig:appendix_co_occurrence_yellow} present histograms for each combination of color and shape goal for both the expert and random agent. We note that semantic co-occurrence, while prevalent, is not always perfectly the case. For instance, Figure \ref{fig:appendix_co_occurrence_blue}, the most commonly observed semantic in the expert agent trajectories for the blue color and ball shape was "box", as opposed to the expected "ball" semantic.
