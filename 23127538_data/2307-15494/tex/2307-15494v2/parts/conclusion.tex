In this paper, we proposed the Emergent Textual Hindsight Experience Replay (ETHER) agent, which builds on HER~\citep{andrychowicz2017hindsight} and HIGhER~\cite{cideron2020higher} by adressing their limitations.
Firstly, a discriminative visual referential game, commonly studied in the subfield of Emergent Communication, is used as an unsupervised auxiliary task. 
Secondly, a semantic grounding scheme is employed to align the emergent language with the natural language of the instruction-following benchmark. 
We show that the speaker and listener agents of the referential game make an artificial language emerge that can be aligned with the natural-like language used to describe goals in the BabyAI benchmark, and that it is expressive enough so as to also describe unsuccessful RL trajectories and thus provide feedback to the RL agent to leverage the linguistic, structured information contained in all trajectories.
Our work shows that emergent communication is a viable unsupervised auxiliary task for goal-conditioned RL in sparse reward settings and provides missing pieces, i.e. a learned predicate function, to make HER more widely applicable.
