 abstractNote={Publisher Summary This chapter presents a view of the problems that have been solved by Monte Carlo in certain areas of heat transfer, and the techniques used in their solution. Only the straightforward Monte Carlo approach has been given. The machine running time of Monte Carlo programs have been discussed. No definitive method of predicting running time exists for most problems. The time used will depend, of course, on the machine used, and perhaps more strongly on the ability of the programmer to pick methods and shortcuts that will reduce the burden on the machine. An example of such a shortcut is the use of special subroutines for computation of such functions as sine and cosine. These routines sacrifice some accuracy to a gain in speed. If problem answers accurate to a few per cent are desired, then the use of eight-place functions from a relatively slow subroutine is a needless luxury, especially if the subroutine is to be used tens of thousands of times. The chapter discusses the fruitless argument as to whether Monte Carlo or some other method is a “better” way of attacking a given problem.},

abstract = {We describe CPMC-Lab, a Matlab program for the constrained-path and phaseless auxiliary-field Monte Carlo methods. These methods have allowed applications ranging from the study of strongly correlated models, such as the Hubbard model, to ab initio calculations in molecules and solids. The present package implements the full ground-state constrained-path Monte Carlo (CPMC) method in Matlab with a graphical interface, using the Hubbard model as an example. The package can perform calculations in finite supercells in any dimensions, under periodic or twist boundary conditions. Importance sampling and all other algorithmic details of a total energy calculation are included and illustrated. This open-source tool allows users to experiment with various model and run parameters and visualize the results. It provides a direct and interactive environment to learn the method and study the code with minimal overhead for setup. Furthermore, the package can be easily generalized for auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) calculations in many other models for correlated electron systems, and can serve as a template for developing a production code for AFQMC total energy calculations in real materials. Several illustrative studies are carried out in one- and two-dimensional lattices on total energy, kinetic energy, potential energy, and charge- and spin-gaps.

abstract = {The auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method is a general numerical method for correlated many-electron systems, which is being increasingly applied in lattice models, atoms, molecules, and solids. Here, we introduce the theory and algorithm of the method specialized for real materials and present several recent developments. We give a systematic exposition of the key steps of AFQMC, closely tracking the framework of a modern software library we are developing. The building of a Monte Carlo Hamiltonian, projecting to the ground state, sampling two-body operators, phaseless approximation, and measuring ground state properties are discussed in detail. An advanced implementation for multi-determinant trial wave functions is described, which dramatically speeds up the algorithm and reduces the memory cost. We propose a self-consistent constraint for real materials, and discuss two flavors for its realization, either by coupling the AFQMC calculation to an effective independent-electron calculation or via the natural orbitals of the computed one-body density matrix.},

abstract = {The auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) method provides a computational framework for solving the time-independent Schrödinger equation in atoms, molecules, solids, and a variety of model systems. AFQMC has recently witnessed remarkable growth, especially as a tool for electronic structure computations in real materials. The method has demonstrated excellent accuracy across a variety of correlated electron systems. Taking the form of stochastic evolution in a manifold of nonorthogonal Slater determinants, the method resembles an ensemble of density-functional theory (DFT) calculations in the presence of fluctuating external potentials. Its computational cost scales as a low-power of system size, similar to the corresponding independent-electron calculations. Highly efficient and intrinsically parallel, AFQMC is able to take full advantage of contemporary high-performance computing platforms and numerical libraries. In this review, we provide a self-contained introduction to the exact and constrained variants of AFQMC, with emphasis on its applications to the electronic structure of molecular systems. Representative results are presented, and theoretical foundations and implementation details of the method are discussed.

abstract  ="The energy of the lowest-lying triplet state (T1) relative to the ground and first-excited singlet states (S0{,} S1) plays a critical role in optical multiexcitonic processes of organic chromophores. Focusing on triplet–triplet annihilation (TTA) upconversion{,} the S0 to T1 energy gap{,} known as the triplet energy{,} is difficult to measure experimentally for most molecules of interest. Ab initio predictions can provide a useful alternative{,} however low-scaling electronic structure methods such as the Kohn–Sham and time-dependent variants of Density Functional Theory (DFT) rely heavily on the fraction of exact exchange chosen for a given functional{,} and tend to be unreliable when strong electronic correlation is present. Here{,} we use auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC){,} a scalable electronic structure method capable of accurately describing even strongly correlated molecules{,} to predict the triplet energies for a series of candidate annihilators for TTA upconversion{,} including 9{,}10 substituted anthracenes and substituted benzothiadiazole (BTD) and benzoselenodiazole (BSeD) compounds. We compare our results to predictions from a number of commonly used DFT functionals{,} as well as DLPNO-CCSD(T0){,} a localized approximation to coupled cluster with singles{,} doubles{,} and perturbative triples. Together with S1 estimates from absorption/emission spectra{,} which are well-reproduced by TD-DFT calculations employing the range-corrected hybrid functional CAM-B3LYP{,} we provide predictions regarding the thermodynamic feasibility of upconversion by requiring (a) the measured T1 of the sensitizer exceeds that of the calculated T1 of the candidate annihilator{,} and (b) twice the T1 of the annihilator exceeds its S1 energetic value. We demonstrate a successful example of in silico discovery of a novel annihilator{,} phenyl-substituted BTD{,} and present experimental validation via low temperature phosphorescence and the presence of upconverted blue light emission when coupled to a platinum octaethylporphyrin (PtOEP) sensitizer. The BTD framework thus represents a new class of annihilators for TTA upconversion. Its chemical functionalization{,} guided by the computational tools utilized herein{,} provides a promising route towards high energy (violet to near-UV) emission."}

Second, we present a correlated sampling approach for calculating energy differences in variational Monte Carlo much more accurately than the values of the energies. This method is used to calculate the potential energy surfaces of H2 and BH. In the case of BH, at bond lengths 10\% different from the reference geometry, the reduced statistical error in the relative energy results in a factor of 3000 saving in computer time.},

Calculations carried out in parallel with scaled length and energy parameters are found to provide substantial cancellations of random sampling error and to yield energy differences with high accuracy for structures differing up to about 10% in size. For larger differences in size the accuracies in energy differences are much lower. The calculation effort for a dozen structures is about the same as that for a single structure when the same scaled trial function is used for all. Results for the test case of the molecular ion H3+ are presented.}

    abstract = { It is pointed out that one of the main effects of correlation phenomena in d- and f-bands is to give rise to behaviour characteristic of the atomic or Heitler-London model. To investigate this situation a simple, approximate model for the interaction of electrons in narrow energy bands is introduced. The results of applying the Hartree-Fock approximation to this model are examined. Using a Green function technique an approximate solution of the correlation problem for this model is obtained. This solution has the property of reducing to the exact atomic solution in the appropriate limit and to the ordinary uncorrelated band picture in the opposite limit. The condition for ferromagnetism of this solution is discussed. To clarify the physical meaning of the solution a two-electron example is examined. }

abstract = {In many materials, charge carriers are well described as noninteracting quasiparticles. However, in materials with strong correlations, this approximation can break down, leading to anomalous transport properties at high temperatures. Huang et al. used quantum Monte Carlo calculations to look for this so-called strange metal phase in the simplest two-dimensional model of interacting electrons, the Hubbard model. They found that the calculated resistivity had a linear temperature dependence when hole doping was introduced, as expected in the strange metal phase. This observation provides confidence that simplified models can be used to describe and understand the behavior of real materials, such as cuprate high-temperature superconductors. Science, this issue p. 987 Quantum Monte Carlo calculations indicate the presence of anomalous transport in the normal state of the 2D Hubbard model. Strange or bad metallic transport, defined by incompatibility with the conventional quasiparticle picture, is a theme common to many strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors. The Hubbard model represents a minimal starting point for modeling strongly correlated systems. Here we demonstrate strange metallic transport in the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model using determinantal quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Over a wide range of doping, we observe resistivities exceeding the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit with linear temperature dependence. The temperatures of our calculations extend to as low as 1/40 of the noninteracting bandwidth, placing our findings in the degenerate regime relevant to experimental observations of strange metallicity. Our results provide a foundation for connecting theories of strange metals to models of strongly correlated materials.}}

    abstract = "{Approximate solutions to the ab initio electronic structure problem have been a focus of theoretical and computational chemistry research for much of the past century, with the goal of predicting relevant energy differences to within “chemical accuracy” (1 kcal/mol). For small organic molecules, or in general, for weakly correlated main group chemistry, a hierarchy of single-reference wave function methods has been rigorously established, spanning perturbation theory and the coupled cluster (CC) formalism. For these systems, CC with singles, doubles, and perturbative triples is known to achieve chemical accuracy, albeit at O(N7) computational cost. In addition, a hierarchy of density functional approximations of increasing formal sophistication, known as Jacob’s ladder, has been shown to systematically reduce average errors over large datasets representing weakly correlated chemistry. However, the accuracy of such computational models is less clear in the increasingly important frontiers of chemical space including transition metals and f-block compounds, in which strong correlation can play an important role in reactivity. A stochastic method, phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC), has been shown to be capable of producing chemically accurate predictions even for challenging molecular systems beyond the main group, with relatively low O(N3 − N4) cost and near-perfect parallel efficiency. Herein, we present our perspectives on the past, present, and future of the ph-AFQMC method. We focus on its potential in transition metal quantum chemistry to be a highly accurate, systematically improvable method that can reliably probe strongly correlated systems in biology and chemical catalysis and provide reference thermochemical values (for future development of density functionals or interatomic potentials) when experiments are either noisy or absent. Finally, we discuss the present limitations of the method and where we expect near-term development to be most fruitful.}",
