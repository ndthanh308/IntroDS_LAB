	abstract = {Snake-like robots have attracted attention as robots that can travel over rough terrain where wheeled mobility mechanisms cannot. Previous research on snake-like robots has mainly focused on the biological movement of snakes; therefore, the issue of power consumption caused by driving a large number of actuators still remains unaddressed. In this study, we propose an efficient movement method using the movement of the center of gravity (COG) as a solution to the above-mentioned problem. In the proposed method, the snake-like robot is first transformed into a wheel shape, and then, some motors of the joint are moved to shift the COG and rotate the robot. Therefore, good movement efficiency can be achieved on leveled terrain by the rolling movement, and a snake-like undulating drive with high running performance can be selected on underwater and rough terrain. To realize the proposed movement method, we propose a method for switching between the rotational movement and undulation drive modes. However, the rolling motion with a COG shift needs a design of an appropriate orbit of the eccentric COG and timing of the motion stage transition. In this study, we demonstrate the rolling motion design with a simplified equation of motion. Next, experiments are conducted to verify the traveling efficiency in the proposed rolling mode, and it is proven that the method can achieve twice the traveling efficiency of the undulating motion.},

We propose a framework based on integrating mechanical intelligence and control. In this design framework, small adjustments led by several tiny low-power actuators called primers can yield significant flight control roles owing to the robot's computational structures.

	abstract = {There have been several successful implementations of bio-inspired legged robots that can trot, walk, and hop robustly even in the presence of significant unplanned disturbances. Despite all of these accomplishments, practical control and high-level decision-making algorithms in multimodal legged systems are overlooked. In nature, animals such as birds impressively showcase multiple modes of mobility including legged and aerial locomotion. They are capable of performing robust locomotion over large walls, tight spaces, and can recover from unpredictable situations such as sudden gusts or slippery surfaces. Inspired by these animals’ versatility and ability to combine legged and aerial mobility to negotiate their environment, our main goal is to design and control legged robots that integrate two completely different forms of locomotion, ground and aerial mobility, in a single platform. Our robot, the Husky Carbon, is being developed to integrate aerial and legged locomotion and to transform between legged and aerial mobility. This work utilizes a Reference Governor (RG) based on low-level control of Husky’s dynamical model to maintain the efficiency of legged locomotion, uses Probabilistic Road Maps (PRM) and 3D A⋆ algorithms to generate an optimal path based on the energetic cost of transport for legged and aerial mobility.},

The flapping wings generate complex wake structures that influence the aerodynamic forces, which can be difficult to model. While it is possible to model these forces using fluidstructure interaction, it is very computationally expensive and difficult to formulate. In this paper, we follow a simpler approach by deriving the aerodynamic forces using a relatively small number of states and presenting them in a simple state-space form. The formulation utilizes Prandtl's lifting line theory and Wagner's function to determine the unsteady aerodynamic forces acting on the wing in a simulation, which then are compared to experimental data of the bat-inspired robot called the Aerobat. The simulated trailingedge vortex shedding can be evaluated from this model, which then can be analyzed for a wake-based gait design approach to improve the aerodynamic performance of the robot.},

In these situations, widely used averaging techniques can fail quickly. The primary motivation is to find efficient models for complex forms of aerial locomotion where wings constitute a large part of body mass (i.e., dominant inertial effects) and deform in multiple directions (i.e., morphing wing). In these systems, high degrees of freedom yields complex inertial, Coriolis, and gravity terms. We use Algorithmic Differentiation (AD) and Bayesian filters computed with cubature rules conjointly to quickly estimate complex fluid-structure interactions. In general, Bayesian filters involve finding complex numerical integration (e.g., find posterior integrals). Using cubature rules to compute Gaussian-weighted integrals and AD, we show that the complex multi-degrees-of-freedom dynamics of morphing MAVs can be computed very efficiently and accurately. Therefore, our work facilitates closed-loop feedback control of these morphing MAVs.},

In the MVAM problem, we attempt to allocate mass in our designs such that the energetic performance is affected the least. To solve the MVAM problem, we adopted a generative design approach using Grasshopper’s evolutionary solver to synthesize a parametric design space for Husky. Then, this space was searched for the morphologies that could yield a minimized Total Cost Of Transport (TCOT) and payload. This approach revealed that a front heavy quadrupedal robot can achieve a lower TCOT while retaining larger margins on allowable added mass to its design.

	abstract = {Our goal in this work is to expand the theory and practice of robot locomotion by addressing critical challenges associated with the robotic biomimicry of bat aerial locomotion. Bats are known for their pronounced, fast wing articulations, e.g., bats can mobilize as many as forty joints during a single wingbeat, with some joints reaching to over one thousand degrees per second in angular speed. Copying bats flight is a significant ordeal, however, very rewarding. Aerial drones with morphing bodies similar to bats can be safer, agile and energy efficient owing to their articulated and soft wings. Current design paradigms have failed to copy bat flight because they assume only closed-loop feedback roles and ignore computational roles carried out by morphology. To respond to the urgency, a design framework called Morphing via Integrated Mechanical Intelligence and Control (MIMIC) is proposed. In this paper, using the dynamic model of Northeastern University's Aerobat, which is designed to test the effectiveness of the MIMIC framework, it will be shown that computational structures and closed-loop feedback can be successfully used to mimic bats stable flight apparatus.},

A Bat, in particular, has a very articulated armwing mechanism with high degrees-of-freedom and flexibility which allows the animal to perform highly dynamic and complex maneuvers, such as upside-down perching. This paper presents the derivation of a multi-body dynamical system of a bio-inspired bat robot called Aerobat which captures multiple biologically meaningful degrees-of-freedom for flapping flight that is present in biological bats. Then, the work attempts to manifest closed-loop aerial body reorientation and preparation for landing through the manipulation of inertial dynamics and aerodynamics by enforcing nonholonomic constraints onto the system. The proposed design paradigm assumes for rapidly exponentially stable controllers that enforce holonomic constraints in the joint space of the model.

Bat Bot (B2) is a bio-inspired flying robot that mimics bat flight, and it possesses the ability to follow a designed trajectory with its on-board electronics and sensing. However, B2's periodic flapping and its complex aerodynamics present major challenges in modeling and planning feasible flight paths. In this paper, we present a generalized approach that uses a model with direct collocation methods to plan dynamically feasible flight maneuvers. The model is made to be both accurate through collection of load cell force data for parameter selection and computationally inexpensive such that it can be used efficiently in a nonlinear solver. We compute the trajectory of launching B2 to a desired altitude and a banked turn maneuver, and we validate our methods with experimental flight results of tracking the launch trajectory with a PD controller.},

Our approach is motivated by recent studies on biological bat flight that have shown that the salient aspects of wing motion can be accurately represented in a low-dimensional space. Although bats have over 40 degrees of freedom (DoFs), our robot possesses several biologically meaningful morphing specializations. We use principal component analysis (PCA) to characterize the two most dominant modes of biological bat flight kinematics, and we optimize our robot’s parametric kinematics to mimic these. The method yields a robot that is reduced from five degrees of actuation (DoAs) to just three, and that actively folds its wings within a wingbeat period. As a result of mimicking synergies, the robot produces an average net lift improvesment of 89\% over the same robot when its wings cannot fold.},

	abstract = {Bats have long captured the imaginations of scientists and engineers with their unrivaled agility and maneuvering characteristics, achieved by functionally versatile dynamic wing conformations as well as more than 40 active and passive joints on the wings. Wing flexibility and complex wing kinematics not only bring a unique perspective to research in biology and aerial robotics but also pose substantial technological challenges for robot modeling, design, and control. We have created a fully self-contained, autonomous flying robot that weighs 93 grams, called Bat Bot (B2), to mimic such morphological properties of bat wings. Instead of using a large number of distributed control actuators, we implement highly stretchable silicone-based membrane wings that are controlled at a reduced number of dominant wing joints to best match the morphological characteristics of bat flight. First, the dominant degrees of freedom (DOFs) in the bat flight mechanism are identified and incorporated in B2’s design by means of a series of mechanical constraints. These biologically meaningful DOFs include asynchronous and mediolateral movements of the armwings and dorsoventral movements of the legs. Second, the continuous surface and elastic properties of bat skin under wing morphing are realized by an ultrathin (56 micrometers) membranous skin that covers the skeleton of the morphing wings. We have successfully achieved autonomous flight of B2 using a series of virtual constraints to control the articulated, morphing wings.},

	abstract = {Recent works have shown success in mimicking the flapping flight of bats on the robotic platform Bat Bot (B2). This robot has only five actuators but retains the ability to flap and fold-unfold its wings in flight. However, this bat-like robot has been unable to perform folding-unfolding of its wings within the period of a wingbeat cycle, about 100 ms. The DC motors operating the spindle mechanisms cannot attain this folding speed. Biological bats rely on this periodic folding of their wings during the upstroke of the wingbeat cycle. It reduces the moment of inertia of the wings and limits the negative lift generated during the upstroke. Thus, we consider it important to achieve wing folding during the upstroke. A mechanism was designed to couple the flapping cycle to the folding cycle of the robot. We then use biological data to further optimize the mechanism such that the kinematic synergies of the robot best match those of a biological bat. This ensures that folding is performed at the correct point in the wingbeat cycle.},

This is in sharp contrast to what we observe in other simpler forms of flight such as insects, which stay at their static equilibrium. Encouraged by biological examinations that have revealed bats exhibit periodic and stable limit cycles, this work demonstrates that one effective approach to stabilize articulated flying robots with bat morphology is locating feasible limit cycles for these robots; then, designing controllers that retain the closed-loop system trajectories within a bounded neighborhood of the designed periodic orbits. This control design paradigm has been evaluated in practice on a recently developed bio-inspired robot called Bat Bot (B2).},

In recent work, a bat inspired soft Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) called Bat Bot (B2) with ﬁve Degrees of Actuation (DoA) has been constructed to mimic the ﬂight behavior of a biological bat. Major differences in structural topology resulted from this simpler kinematic complexity, and thus it is necessary to ﬁnd the dimensions of B2’s structure and the behavior of its actuators such that the wingbeat cycle of B2 closely mimics that of a biological bat. The current work assumes the previously designed structure of B2 and presents a synergistic design approach to imitate the kinematic synergies of a biological bat. Recent ﬁndings have unveiled that the most dominant synergies in a biological bat could be combined to accurately represent the original kinematic movement, therefore simplifying its dimensional complexity. In this work, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been employed in order to extract dominant principal components of biological bat ﬂight kinematics. Thereafter, ﬁrst and second principal components are chosen to shape the parametric kinematics and actuator trajectories of B2 through ﬁnite state nonlinear constrained optimization. The method yields a robot mechanism that despite having a few DoAs, it possesses several biologically meaningful morphing specializations.},

The current work introduces a biologically inspired soft robot called Bat Bot (B2). The overall system is a flapping machine with 5 Degrees of Actuation (DoA). This work reports on some of the preliminary untethered flights of B2. B2 has a nontrivial morphology and it has been designed after examining several biological bats. Key DoAs, which contribute significantly to bat flight, are picked and incorporated in B2's flight mechanism design.

	abstract = {This paper presents a systematic flight controller design based on the mathematics of parametrized manifolds and calculus of variations for the Bat Bot (B2), which possesses many articulated wings. Wing kinematics and morphological properties are crucial in the powered flight of flying vertebrates. The articulated skeleton of these mammals, which contains many degrees of actuation and underactuation, has made it difficult to understand the connection between the bat's flight dynamics and its intricate array of physiological and morphological specializations. B2 is a biomimetic micro aerial vehicle (MAV) that possesses similar morphological properties to a bat in order to duplicate bats powered ballistic motion. In an effort to design the advanced flight control algorithm for B2, this paper reports two major contributions. First, a systematic mathematical framework is introduced that evaluates the holonomically-constrained Lagrangian model of a flapping robot with specified active and passive degrees of freedom (DoF) in order to locate physically feasible and biologically meaningful periodic solutions using optimization. These are parametrized constraint manifolds; the flapping wing dynamics are governed by these manifolds. Second, calculus of variations and the well-recognized method of inverse dynamics are applied in order to synthesize the flight control algorithm for the flapping wings.},

The controller was developed using the method of virtual constraints, a control design method first used on the planar point-feet robots Rabbit and MABEL. For the preliminary experiments reported here, virtual constraints were experimentally tuned to achieve robust planar walking and then 3D walking. A key feature of the controller leading to successful 3D walking is the particular choice of virtual constraints in the lateral plane, which implement a lateral balance control strategy similar to SIMBICON. To our knowledge, MARLO is the most highly underactuated bipedal robot to walk unassisted in 3D.},

	abstract = {This work develops feedback controllers for bipedal walking in 3D on level ground, both in simulation and experimentally.  MARLO is a new robot that has been designed for the study of 3D-bipedal locomotion, with the aim of combining energy efficiency, speed, and robustness with respect to natural terrain variations in a single platform. The robot is highly underactuated, having six actuators and, in single support, 13 degrees of freedom. Its sagittal plane dynamics are designed to embody the spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP), which has been shown to provide a dynamic model of the body center of mass during steady running gaits in a wide diversity of terrestrial animals. A detailed dynamic model is used to optimize walking gaits with respect to the cost of mechanical transport (cmt), a dimensionless measure of energetic efficiency.
A feedback controller is designed that balances the robot during the quiet standing mode, and another feedback policy is developed such that the robot can take a transition step from quiet standing to walking. A feedback controller is designed that stabilizes steady-state 3D walking gaits, despite the high degree of underactuation of the robot. These controllers are combined through a state machine that handles switching among the three controllers controllers. In experiments on planarized (2D) and untethered (3D)  versions of the robot with point feet and passive feet (prosthetic feet) walking over flat ground or on a ramp with a shallow slope, the adaptability of the designed controller to the environment (planar or untethered, flat ground or ramp), and to the morphology of the robot (point feet or passive feet), is demonstrated. In experiments on a planarized version of the robot with passive feet, the controller yielded stable walking after starting from quiet standing, autonomously and without any intervention from the operator. In experiments on an untethered (3D) version of the robot, the controller was able to balance the robot over flat ground or on a shallow ramp during the quiet standing mode. In addition, the controller yielded six-untethered ``human-like'' steps after starting from quiet standing, autonomously without any intervention from the operator.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a feedback controller that allows MABEL, which is a kneed planar bipedal robot with 1-m-long legs, to accommodate terrain that presents large unexpected increases and decreases in height. The robot is provided no information regarding where the change in terrain height occurs and by how much. A finite-state machine is designed that manages transitions among controllers for flat-ground walking, stepping-up and -down, and a trip reflex. If the robot completes a step, the depth of a step-down or the height of a step-up can be immediately estimated at impact from the lengths of the legs and the angles of the robot’s joints. The change in height can be used to invoke a proper control response. On the other hand, if the swing leg impacts an obstacle during a step, or has a premature impact with the ground, a trip reflex is triggered on the basis of specially designed contact switches on the robot’s shins, contact switches at the end of each leg, and the current configuration of the robot. The design of each control mode and the transition conditions among them are presented. This paper concludes with experimental results of MABEL (blindly) accommodating various types of platforms, including ascent of a 12.5-cm-high platform, stepping-off an 18.5-cm-high platform, and walking over a platform with multiple ascending and descending steps.},

The goal of this survey is to cover the recent progress toward these applications that has been driven by model-based optimization for the real-time generation and control of movement. The majority of the research community has converged on the idea of generating locomotion control laws by solving an optimal control problem (OCP) in either a model-based or data-driven manner. However, solving the most general of these problems online remains intractable due to complexities from intermittent unidirectional contacts with the environment, and from the many degrees of freedom of legged robots. This survey covers methods that have been pursued to make these OCPs computationally tractable, with specific focus on how environmental contacts are treated, how the model can be simplified, and how these choices affect the numerical solution methods employed. The survey focuses on model-based optimization, covering its recent use in a stand alone fashion, and suggesting avenues for combination with learning-based formulations to further accelerate progress in this growing field.},

	abstract = {Snake robots, sometimes called hyper-redundant mechanisms, can use their many degrees of freedom to achieve a variety of locomotive capabilities. These capabilities are ideally suited for disaster response because the snake robot can thread through tightly packed volumes, accessing locations that people and conventional machinery otherwise cannot. Snake robots also have the advantage of possessing a variety of locomotion capabilities that conventional robots do not. Just like their biological counterparts, snake robots achieve these locomotion capabilities using cyclic motions called gaits. These cyclic motions directly control the snake robot's internal degrees of freedom which, in turn, causes a net motion, say forward, lateral and rotational, for the snake robot. The gaits described in this paper fall into two categories: parameterized and scripted. The parameterized gaits, as their name suggests, can be described by a relative simple parameterized function, whereas the scripted cannot. This paper describes the functions we prescribed for gait generation and our experiences in making these robots operate in real experiments.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an efficient approach for planning collision-free, dynamically-feasible, and low-cost motion trajectories that satisfy task specifications given as formulas in a temporal logic, namely Syntactically Co-Safe Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). The planner is geared toward high-dimensional mobile robots with nonlinear dynamics operating in complex environments. The planner incorporates physics-based engines for accurate simulations of rigid-body dynamics. To obtain computational efficiency and generate low-cost solutions, the planner first imposes a discrete abstraction by combining an automaton representing the LTL formula with a workspace decomposition. The planner then uses the discrete abstraction to induce a partition of a sampling-based motion tree being expanded in the state space into equivalence classes. Each equivalence class captures the progress made toward achieving the temporal logic specifications. Heuristics defined over the abstraction are used to estimate the feasibility of expanding the motion tree from these equivalence classes and reaching an accepting automaton state. Costs are adjusted based on progress made, giving the planner the flexibility to make rapid progress while discovering new ways to expand the search. Comparisons to related work show statistically significant computational speedups and reduced solution costs.},

The robot is provided no information regarding where the change in terrain height occurs and by how much. A ﬁnite-state machine is designed that manages transitions among controllers for ﬂat-ground walking, stepping-up and -down, and a trip reﬂex. If the robot completes a step, the depth of a stepdown or the height of a step-up can be immediately estimated at impact from the lengths of the legs and the angles of the robot’s joints. The change in height can be used to invoke a proper control response. On the other hand, if the swing leg impacts an obstacle during a step, or has a premature impact with the ground, a trip reﬂex is triggered on the basis of specially designed contact switches on the robot’s shins, contact switches at the end of each leg, and the current conﬁguration of the robot. The design of each control mode and the transition conditions among them are presented.

For the preliminary experiments reported here, virtual constraints were experimentally tuned to achieve robust planar walking and then 3D walking. A key feature of the controller leading to successful 3D walking is the particular choice of virtual constraints in the lateral plane, which implement a lateral balance control strategy similar to SIMBICON.

Wing kinematics and morphological properties are crucial in the powered flight of flying vertebrates. The articulated skeleton of these mammals, which contains many degrees of actuation and underactuation, has made it difficult to understand the connection between the bat's flight dynamics and its intricate array of physiological and morphological specializations. B2 is a biomimetic micro aerial vehicle (MAV) that possesses similar morphological properties to a bat in order to duplicate bats powered ballistic motion. In an effort to design the advanced flight control algorithm for B2, this paper reports two major contributions. First, a systematic mathematical framework is introduced that evaluates the holonomically-constrained Lagrangian model of a flapping robot with specified active and passive degrees of freedom (DoF) in order to locate physically feasible and biologically meaningful periodic solutions using optimization. These are parametrized constraint manifolds; the flapping wing dynamics are governed by these manifolds. Second, calculus of variations and the well-recognized method of inverse dynamics are applied in order to synthesize the flight control algorithm for the flapping wings.},

In recent work, a bat inspired soft Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) called Bat Bot (B2) with ﬁve Degrees of Actuation (DoA) has been constructed to mimic the ﬂight behavior of a biological bat. Major differences in structural topology resulted from this simpler kinematic complexity, and thus it is necessary to ﬁnd the dimensions of B2’s structure and the behavior of its actuators such that the wingbeat cycle of B2 closely mimics that of a biological bat. The current work assumes the previously designed structure of B2 and presents a synergistic design approach to imitate the kinematic synergies of a biological bat. Recent ﬁndings have unveiled that the most dominant synergies in a biological bat could be combined to accurately represent the original kinematic movement, therefore simplifying its dimensional complexity. In this work, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been employed in order to extract dominant principal components of biological bat ﬂight kinematics. Thereafter, ﬁrst and second principal components are chosen to shape the parametric kinematics and actuator trajectories of B2 through ﬁnite state nonlinear constrained optimization. The method yields a robot mechanism that despite having a few DoAs, it possesses several biologically meaningful morphing specializations.},

Encouraged by biological examinations that have revealed bats exhibit periodic and stable limit cycles, this work demonstrates that one effective approach to stabilize articulated flying robots with bat morphology is locating feasible limit cycles for these robots; then, designing controllers that retain the closed-loop system trajectories within a bounded neighborhood of the designed periodic orbits.

This robot has only five actuators but retains the ability to flap and fold-unfold its wings in flight. However, this bat-like robot has been unable to perform folding-unfolding of its wings within the period of a wingbeat cycle, about 100 ms. The DC motors operating the spindle mechanisms cannot attain this folding speed. Biological bats rely on this periodic folding of their wings during the upstroke of the wingbeat cycle. It reduces the moment of inertia of the wings and limits the negative lift generated during the upstroke. Thus, we consider it important to achieve wing folding during the upstroke. A mechanism was designed to couple the flapping cycle to the folding cycle of the robot. We then use biological data to further optimize the mechanism such that the kinematic synergies of the robot best match those of a biological bat. This ensures that folding is performed at the correct point in the wingbeat cycle.},

Our approach is motivated by recent studies on biological bat flight that have shown that the salient aspects of wing motion can be accurately represented in a low-dimensional space. Although bats have over 40 degrees of freedom (DoFs), our robot possesses several biologically meaningful morphing specializations. We use principal component analysis (PCA) to characterize the two most dominant modes of biological bat flight kinematics, and we optimize our robot’s parametric kinematics to mimic these. The method yields a robot that is reduced from five degrees of actuation (DoAs) to just three, and that actively folds its wings within a wingbeat period. As a result of mimicking synergies, the robot produces an average net lift improvesment of 89\% over the same robot when its wings cannot fold.},

However, B2's periodic flapping and its complex aerodynamics present major challenges in modeling and planning feasible flight paths. In this paper, we present a generalized approach that uses a model with direct collocation methods to plan dynamically feasible flight maneuvers. The model is made to be both accurate through collection of load cell force data for parameter selection and computationally inexpensive such that it can be used efficiently in a nonlinear solver.

Unlike other animals, bats leverage the manipulation of inertial dynamics to exhibit aerial ﬂip turns when they perch. Inspired by this unique maneuver, this work develops and uses a tiny robot called Harpoon to demonstrate that the preparation for upside-down landing is possible through: 1) reorientation towards the landing surface through zero-angular-momentum turns and 2) reaching to the surface through shooting a detachable landing gear. The closed-loop manipulations of inertial dynamics takes place based on a symplectic description of the dynamical system (body and appendage), which is known to exhibit an excellent geometric conservation properties.},

Such morphological computation or mechanical intelligence draws our attention to the obvious fact that there is a common interconnection between the boundaries of morphology and closed-loop feedback. In this work, we demonstrate that several biologically meaningful degrees of freedom can be interconnected to one another by mechanical intelligence and, as a result, the responsibility of feedback-driven components (e.g., actuated joints) is subsumed under computational morphology.

A Bat, in particular, has a very articulated armwing mechanism with high degrees-offreedom and ﬂexibility which allows the animal to perform highly dynamic and complex maneuvers, such as upside-down perching. This paper presents the derivation of a multi-body dynamical system of a bio-inspired bat robot called Aerobat which captures multiple biologically meaningful degrees-offreedom for ﬂapping ﬂight that is present in biological bats.

The proposed design paradigm assumes for rapidly exponentially stable controllers that enforce holonomic constraints in the joint space of the model.

There are prohibitive design restrictions such as tight power budget and payload, which can particularly become important in aerial flights. To address these challenges, we pose a problem called the Mobility Value of Added Mass (MVAM) problem. In the MVAM problem, we attempt to allocate mass in our designs such that the energetic performance is affected the least. To solve the MVAM problem, we adopted a generative design approach using Grasshopper's evolutionary solver to synthesize a parametric design space for Husky. Then, this space was searched for the morphologies that could yield a minimized Total Cost Of Transport (TCOT) and payload. This approach revealed that a front-heavy quadrupedal robot can achieve a lower TCOT while retaining larger margins on allowable added mass to its design. Based on this framework Husky was built and tested as a front-heavy robot.},

	abstract = {Our goal in this work is to expand the theory and practice of robot locomotion by addressing critical challenges associated with the robotic biomimicry of bat aerial locomotion. Bats are known for their pronounced, fast wing articulations, e.g., bats can mobilize as many as forty joints during a single wingbeat, with some joints reaching over one thousand degrees per second in angular speed. Copying bats flight is a significant ordeal, however, very rewarding. Aerial drones with morphing bodies similar to bats can be safer, agile and energy-efficient owing to their articulated and soft wings. Current design paradigms have failed to copy bat flight because they assume only closed-loop feedback roles and ignore computational roles carried out by morphology. To respond to the urgency, a design framework called Morphing via Integrated Mechanical Intelligence and Control (MIMIC) is proposed. In this paper, using the dynamic model of Northeastern University's Aerobat, which is designed to test the effectiveness of the MIMIC framework, it will be shown that computational structures and closed-loop feedback can be successfully used to mimic bats stable flight apparatus.},

Each module is self-contained, with a sensing or joint function. The robot modules can dock with each other based on relative positioning, which employs the visual perception of passive markers or active infrared signals in different localizations. Performance experiments were conducted to evaluate the robot module. Docking experiments were performed, along with an analysis of the success and failure results. The self-assembly of snake-like and quadruped robots was achieved in response to different environments, including an obstacle, gap or stair, and experiments were performed on self-assembly into a snake-like structure.},

To identify a suitable configuration, the use of libraries has been suggested. However, such libraries usually assume centralized control, and developing a hardware-dependent library for all assumed tasks may be impractical. In this article, we focus on slope and gap traversal tasks for single-legged reconfigurable modular robots. We propose an autonomous distributed system to traverse the environments without determining the desired configuration a priori. Each module locally monitors the failure risk of the environment traversal for the entire robot. When it detects the high failure risk, the entire robot changes its morphology by adding an additional module to the component of the robot at a connecting place determined by the failure experience. By repeating the procedure, the entire robot gradually adapts the morphology to the environment and finally traverses the environment. Through dynamic simulations and robot experiments, we validated that entire robots with several initial configurations succeeded in changing their morphologies and traversing several slope and gap environments.},

Self-reconfigurable modular robots (SRMRs) are known as autonomous kinematic machines that can change their shape by rearranging the connectivity of their modules to perform new tasks, adapt to changing circumstances, and recover from damage. Versatility, reliability, and low-cost are the fundamental promises of SRMRs when compared with conventional robots. This study emphasized the achievements in the field considering the promises and identified the gaps to be filled in the future. The main distinguishing feature of an SRMR is the capability of configuring its shape during operation. Flexibility in shape supported by appropriate controller strategies brings flexibility in task assignment. Classification of SRMRs is enriched by adding a new section based on assigned tasks to the robot. In addition, the classification based on mechanical and controller design aspects is thoroughly inspected in our study. A new subsection of material selection is introduced in the mechanical design aspects section. Adding these sections to the classification is the main difference between our study and the previous review studies. It is expected that the SRMRs field will have more interactions with materials science in the future. The study is concluded by emphasizing the promises of SRMRs and giving a future vision of the field.},

	abstract = {Rescue robots that can penetrate into narrow gaps in the rubble, create and maintain spaces for rescuers after earthquakes are urgently needed in search and rescue missions. This paper proposes two novel rescue robots, including a cutting robot and a jack robot, which are used to cut obstacles and jack up heavy debris in hazardous locations and in narrow spaces, where rescuers cannot work or approach. Firstly, a multi-linked tracked, or snake-like rescue robot platform is designed, which is composed of modular crawler vehicles connected by active and passive joints with three degrees of freedom. This rescue robot platform has high mobility on irregular terrains and the ability to move into narrow collapsed structures. Then, portable rescue tools including an electric cutter and a novel electric screw jack are designed. In order to perform operations to the tools, manipulators with multi degrees of freedom are also developed. Consequently, the cutting robot and jack robot are realized by equipping the corresponding rescue tool and manipulator in the rescue robot platform. Finally, field tests of the two rescue robots operating on different terrains and performing rescue missions are carried out in the national training base for urban search and rescue. The results validated the mobility, cutting and lift-up capacity of the two rescue robots. The experiments show that they might play some role in rescue operations.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a biomimetic approach based on central pattern generator (CPG), to control turning motion of a snake-like robot. One of the interesting features of a biological snake is its ability to avoid obstacles or a barrier by turning its whole body from its trajectory. This special obstacle avoidance motion is different from other types of animal, and thus, it is worth to be analyzed and realized into a snake-like robot. The paper first briefly explains: 1) the phase oscillator model which represents the CPG model and 2) the CPG network. Next, we address several issues related to the existing/typical turning control of a snake-like robot. We then propose the phase transition method utilizing the phase difference control parameter to realize the turning motion of a snake-like robot. We also introduce a new parameter to control the turning of the robot, where it provides a way to incorporate sensory feedback into the CPG model. Simulation results show that the proposed turning method can be used efficiently as an obstacle avoidance method for a snake-like robot.},

According to the CPG mechanism, a hierarchical CCPG model (HCCPG) with small complexity is proposed to implement the three-dimensional gaits better. The HCCPG has a two-layers structure, namely the basic rhythmic signal generation layer and the output signal modulation layer. The HCCPG can generate three-dimensional gaits well and is extendable. Based on the HCCPG, a three-dimensional gait control method is proposed. The simulations and experiments validate this method.},

The proposed robot system has modular structures with extendable length. It is subdivided into body, neck, head and tail modules. Each body module has two rotary motors to generate pitch and yaw motions of the snake robot. A linear actuator is also installed inside each body module in order to change the length of robot. The neck module in the robot is provided with two rotary motors to make the spherical motion of head module. Neural oscillator based central pattern generators (CPG) are used to produce rhythmic patterns for various snake robot movements, for example, serpentine, side-winding, two-step-concertina and four-step-concertina motions are generated in the snake robot using the proposed CPG algorithm. For serpentine motion, the body of robot is bent to form the planar sinusoidal waveform using whole body modules on the ground. To generate side-winding motion, the robot body is bent in such a way that it makes two dimensional sinusoidal waveform and only a few points of its body make contacts with the ground. By using the CPG algorithm, these contact points are propagated from tail to head, and the robot is ultimately moved along one side. In concertina motion, the body is sequentially pushed forward in steps from tail to head using the proposed algorithm. Finally several experiments are conducted on a laboratory floor in order to confirm the authenticity of robot design and CPG algorithm so that the comparison between different motions can be achieved.},

The proposed CPG model has the ability to produce stable rhythmic patterns applied both in the serpentine locomotion and sidewinding locomotion of snake robots. The global exponential stability of the model is also presented using the partial contraction theory. An important point addressed in this paper is that the proposed CPG model has explicit control parameters including not only frequencies of oscillation and amplitudes of oscillation but also phase differences between the neighbor oscillators. The method to adjust the speed and direction of the snake robot during the locomotion is discussed by modulating the control parameters in the proposed CPG model directly. Simulation results together with the experiments on a real snake robot show that the proposed CPG approach can be used to control snake robots successfully.},

	abstract = {Snake-like robots with 3D locomotion ability have significant advantages of adaptive travelling in diverse complex terrain over traditional legged or wheeled mobile robots. Despite numerous developed gaits, these snake-like robots suffer from unsmooth gait transitions by changing the locomotion speed, direction, and body shape, which would potentially cause undesired movement and abnormal torque. Hence, there exists a knowledge gap for snake-like robots to achieve autonomous locomotion. To address this problem, this paper presents the smooth slithering gait transition control based on a lightweight central pattern generator (CPG) model for snake-like robots. First, based on the convergence behavior of the gradient system, a lightweight CPG model with fast computing time was designed and compared with other widely adopted CPG models. Then, by reshaping the body into a more stable geometry, the slithering gait was modified, and studied based on the proposed CPG model, including the gait transition of locomotion speed, moving direction, and body shape. In contrast to sinusoid-based method, extensive simulations and prototype experiments finally demonstrated that smooth slithering gait transition can be effectively achieved using the proposed CPG-based control method without generating undesired locomotion and abnormal torque.},

To simplify calculations, sidewinding locomotion and sinus-lifting motion are considered planar movements. Vertical movements are assumed to be small but play a critical role in change where contacts are made. Thus, the normal forces acting on grounded links and the torques applied to pitch joints can be calculated by solving equilibrium equations. The tradeoff between locomotion speed and energy efficiency is studied for all three gaits, at eight different environmental settings distinguished by friction coefficients. Simulation results reveal that sinus-lifting motion and sidewinding locomotion are generally more energy-efficient gaits than is lateral undulation. More specifically, if the anisotropy in friction is large enough, sinus-lifting motion is the most energy-efficient gait; otherwise, sidewinding locomotion is more efficient. However, there are some critical speeds at which the most efficient gait changes, in some environmental settings.},

To create the Super Servo, we have replaced the electronics in a hobby servo, adding such components as sensors to monitor current and temperature, a communications bus, and a programmable microcontroller. Any robust solution must also protect components from hazardous environments such as sand and brush. To resolve this problem we insert the robots into skins that cover their surface. Functions such as climbing the inside and outside of a pipe add a new dimension of interaction. Thus we attach a compliant, high-friction material to every module, which assists in tasks that require gripping.

This is due to a lack of understanding of how to control 3-D body bending to push against terrain features to generate and control propulsion. Biological studies suggested that generalist snakes use contact force sensing to adjust body bending in real time to do so. However, studying this sensory-modulated force control in snakes is challenging, due to a lack of basic knowledge of how their force sensing organs work. Here, we take a robophysics approach to make progress, starting by developing a snake robot capable of 3-D body bending with contact force sensing to enable systematic locomotion experiments and force measurements. Through two development and testing iterations, we created a 12-segment robot with 36 piezo-resistive sheet sensors distributed on all segments with compliant shells with a sampling frequency of 30 Hz. The robot measured contact forces while traversing a large obstacle using vertical bending with high repeatability, achieving the goal of providing a platform for systematic experiments. Finally, we explored model-based calibration considering the viscoelastic behavior of the piezo-resistive sensor, which will for useful for future studies.},

To attain POAL from a control standpoint, the accurate identification of push-points and reliable determination of feasible contact reaction forces are required. This is difficult to achieve with rigidly actuated robots because of the lack of compliance. As a possible solution to this challenge, our research group recently presented Serpens, a low-cost, open-source, and highly compliant multi-purpose modular snake robot with a series elastic actuator (SEA). In this paper, we propose a new prototyping iteration for our snake robot to achieve a more dependable design. The following three contributions are outlined in this work as a whole: the remodelling of the elastic joint with the addition of a damper element; a refreshed design for the screw-less assembly mechanism that can now withstand higher transverse forces; the re-design of the joint module with an improved reorganisation of the internal hardware components to facilitate heat dissipation and to accommodate a larger battery with easier access. The Robot Operating System (ROS) serves as the foundation for the software architecture. The possibility of applying machine learning approaches is considered.

The Active Cord Mechanism (ACM) assumption, initiated by Hirose, is implemented. The robot motion results from different joint torques and frictional reacting forces in each wheel. In this study, we proposed a modified serpeniod function with steering command to control the robot's direction. We also performed dynamic analysis using Kane's method. Holonomic constraints under frictional forces and nonholonomic constraints unders velocities were considered.

	doi = {10.1109/IROS.1994.407513},
	abstract = {This article describes the design of an 8 degree of freedom snake-like robot, the R7 manipulator. The purpose of the device is to position a CCD camera and to rapidly acquire a sequence of images in an environment containing obstacles that may constrain the motion of the robot. Because of these requirements, it was desirable to minimize the manipulator's size and maximize its speed while preserving accuracy. These goals led to a unique design that is presented here. The device consists of four transmission modules. Each module has 2 degrees of freedom and contains a dual differential drive mechanism. Each module is a little more than 1.0" in diameter. The coordinated motion of these differential drives produces a prehensile motion of each transmission module. The range of motion of each module is /spl plusmn/90/spl deg/ in yaw and pitch. The smooth prehensile bending easily accommodate fragile cables and wiring harnesses. A benefit of using rigid links, as in this design, is an increase in stiffness of the mechanism. High stiffness aids in rapid positioning. One key feature of the mechanism is the use of low tension cable drive. Cables pass over a series of stationary sheaves and transmit power to transmission units located in each module. The use of a gear reducing transmission allows the use of low tension cables. This paper describes the design of the R7 manipulator and supporting electronics. Also discussed is the numerical solution to the inverse kinematics for this novel manipulator. The robot was built at Hughes Aircraft.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

The motion planning system provides the robot with a basic motion pattern that can be easily modified for different tasks and environments. The mechanical snake does not avoid obstacles on its way, but rather "accommodates" them by continuing its motion towards the target while in contact with the obstacles. With the authors' design and motion planning, each link has a different number of degrees-of-freedom in each motion stage, providing the robot with great adaptability even during contact with obstacles in a cluttered environment.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

This approach is based on a "backbone curve" that captures the robot's macroscopic geometric features. The inverse kinematic, or "hyper-redundancy resolution," problem reduces to determining the time varying backbone curve behavior. To efficiently solve the inverse kinematics problem, the authors introduce a "modal" approach, in which a set of intrinsic backbone curve shape functions are restricted to a modal form. The singularities of the modal approach, modal non-degeneracy conditions, and modal switching are considered. For discretely segmented morphologies, the authors introduce "fitting" algorithms that determine the actuator displacements that cause the discrete manipulator to adhere to the backbone curve. These techniques are demonstrated with planar and spatial mechanism examples. They have also been implemented on a 30 degree-of-freedom robot prototype.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Snake robots have the potential to maneuver through tightly packed and complex environments. One challenge in enabling them to do so is the complexity in determining how to coordinate their many degrees-of-freedom to create purposeful motion. This is especially true in the types of terrains considered in this work: environments full of unmodeled features that even the best of maps would not capture, motivating us to develop closed-loop controls to react to those features. To accomplish this, this work uses proprioceptive sensing, mainly the force information measured by the snake robot's joints, to react to unmodeled terrain. We introduce a biologically-inspired strategy called directional compliance which modulates the effective stiffness of the robot so that it conforms to the terrain in some directions and resists in others. We present a dynamical system that switches between modes of locomotion to handle situations in which the robot gets wedged or stuck. This approach enables the snake robot to reliably traverse a planar peg array and an outdoor three-dimensional pile of rocks.},

We first find that the motion at the connection point between two motions must coincide with the tangential movement during motion transition across different environments. We then design a gait called the circular pedal wave. This circular pedal wave allows a hoop-passing motion in which the whole body moves as if it is passing through a virtual hoop fixed in space in sequence from its head through combination with a proposed shift part. The hoop-passing motion allows motion transition across different environments. We propose three application examples of this hoop-passing motion, namely passing through a hole in a wall, entering an underfloor, and attaching to a ladder. We report on experiments conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method and to realize the described motions.},

	abstract = {In nature, snakes can gracefully traverse a wide range of different and complex environments. Snake robots that can mimic this behaviour could be fitted with sensors and transport tools to hazardous or confined areas that other robots and humans are unable to access. In order to carry out such tasks, snake robots must have a high degree of awareness of their surroundings (i.e., perception-driven locomotion) and be capable of efficient obstacle exploitation (i.e., obstacle-aided locomotion) to gain propulsion. These aspects are pivotal in order to realise the large variety of possible snake robot applications in real-life operations such as fire-fighting, industrial inspection, search-and-rescue, and more. In this paper, we survey and discuss the state of the art, challenges, and possibilities of perception-driven obstacle-aided locomotion for snake robots. To this end, different levels of autonomy are identified for snake robots and categorised into environmental complexity, mission complexity, and external system independence. From this perspective, we present a step-wise approach on how to increment snake robot abilities within guidance, navigation, and control in order to target the different levels of autonomy. Pertinent to snake robots, we focus on current strategies for snake robot locomotion in the presence of obstacles. Moreover, we put obstacle-aided locomotion into the context of perception and mapping. Finally, we present an overview of relevant key technologies and methods within environment perception, mapping, and representation that constitute important aspects of perception-driven obstacle-aided locomotion.},

	abstract = {Although substantial advancements have been achieved in robot-assisted surgery, the blueprint to existing snake robotics predominantly focuses on the preliminary structural design, control, and human–robot interfaces, with features which have not been particularly explored in the literature. This paper aims to conduct a review of planning and operation concepts of hyper-redundant serpentine robots for surgical use, as well as any future challenges and solutions for better manipulation. Current researchers in the field of the manufacture and navigation of snake robots have faced issues, such as a low dexterity of the end-effectors around delicate organs, state estimation and the lack of depth perception on two-dimensional screens. A wide range of robots have been analysed, such as the i2Snake robot, inspiring the use of force and position feedback, visual servoing and augmented reality (AR). We present the types of actuation methods, robot kinematics, dynamics, sensing, and prospects of AR integration in snake robots, whilst addressing their shortcomings to facilitate the surgeon’s task. For a smoother gait control, validation and optimization algorithms such as deep learning databases are examined to mitigate redundancy in module linkage backlash and accidental self-collision. In essence, we aim to provide an outlook on robot configurations during motion by enhancing their material compositions within anatomical biocompatibility standards.},

The experimental results compare well with the theoretical model, although the exact coefficient of friction during the experiment was not measured. Theoretical and experimental results both indicate a slight backward motion of the robot during the contractile phase of the cycle of motion. Although the results are similar, the theoretical model fails to include such phenomena as the friction in the revolute joints and the vibration produced by the pump and servos.

The algorithm is applicable to a wide range range of snake robot morphologies. The algorithm requires little space, and control is simple, since motion occurs only in a plane. Analysis of the algorithm reveals a strong relation between the maximum dynamic torque required and the joint pitch range. We discuss some consequences for the design of snake robots. For instance, an adjustment of the mass center of the robot's end segment can reduce the maximum dynamic torque. Implications are studied for some snake robot joint designs, including Dragon, an autonomous snake robot constructed for the study of unconventional locomotion.},

Control equations of 3-dimensional locomotion were established by the composition of two bending motions in mutual orthogonal plane. Three types of lateral rolling locomotion, flapping, linear rolling and curved rolling, were achieved by controlling the amplitudes and the number of two waves in the two bending motions. Using the three types of locomotion the snake robot can realize net lateral translation, alternation of its contact base and rolling over some obstacles. The lateral rolling locomotion obtains its driving force through the interaction with the environment. The rolling shape and its direction depend on the transferring direction and phase difference of the two waves respectively.},

Muscular force is then discussed for this uniform locomotive curve. We also compare the locomotive efficiencies for various creeping movement curves of snake locomotion, by analyzing the ratio of the tangential force to the normal force and the power required for snake locomotion. The results show that the proposed serpentine curve is more valid as the snake creeping locomotion shape than the formerly suggested curves.},

	abstract = {Animals move in diverse ways, as indicated in part by the wide variety of gaits and modes that have been described for vertebrate locomotion. Much variation in the gaits of limbed animals is associated with changing speed, whereas different modes of snake locomotion are often associated with moving on different surfaces. For several decades different types of snake locomotion have been categorized as one of four major modes: rectilinear, lateral undulation, sidewinding, and concertina. Recent empirical work shows that the scheme of four modes of snake locomotion is overly conservative. For example, during aquatic lateral undulation, the timing between muscle activity and lateral bending changes along the length of the snake, which is unlike terrestrial lateral undulation. The motor pattern used to prevent sagging while bridging gaps also suggests that arboreal lateral undulation on narrow surfaces or with a few discrete points of support has a different motor pattern than terrestrial lateral undulation when the entire length of the snake is supported. In all types of concertina locomotion, the distance from the head to the tail changes substantially as snakes alternately flex and then extend different portions of their body. However, snakes climbing cylinders with concertina exert forces medially to attain a purchase on the branch, whereas tunnels require pushing laterally to form an anchoring region. Furthermore, different motor patterns are used for these two types of concertina movement. Some snakes climb vertical cylinders with helical wrapping completely around the cylinder, whereas all other forms of concertina bend regions of the body alternately to the left and right. Current data support rectilinear locomotion and sidewinding as being distinct modes, whereas lateral undulation and concertina are best used for defining categories of gaits with some unifying similarities. Partly as a result of different motor patterns, I propose recognizing five and four distinct types of lateral undulation and concertina, respectively, resulting in a total of 11 distinct gaits previously recognized as only four.},

The kinematic analysis is based on a continuous 'backbone curve' model which captures the robot's important macroscopic features.

The most effective movement pattern, flexible locomotion gaits such as side winding, crawling, plunging and leaping can be implemented on a snake robot. The snake robot can be used for many applications such as search and rescue operations in collapsed structure and inspection of tightly packed space that people and conventional machinery cannot access. To make the snake robot work or function like a real biological snake, it is constructed using many joints that enables the robot to have various degrees of bends, and gives the robot ability to be flexible enough to reach or approach different terrains. This ability of snake robot enables it to move around in complex environments.},

This validation is described using a function that relates the reliability of sensor data to the internal shape of the robot within a gait cycle. We use a recently developed technique for choosing a “good” frame on such a robot to create a substitution for a motion model. We demonstrate the advantages of our technique using a KinectTMperforming an open-source implementation of 6DOF SLAM.

The compared approaches for representing shape and pose of the snake robot differ primarily in the use of a body frame fixed to the pose of a single module versus one that is aligned with the virtual chassis. Additionally, we evaluate a state representation that explicitly tracks joint angles for improved estimates. For one particular gait, rolling, we present experimental data where motion capture data of the snake robot is used as ground truth to compare the accuracy of the state estimates from these techniques. We show that using the virtual chassis body frame, rather than a fixed body frame, results in improved accuracy of the snake robot's estimated pitch and roll. We also show that, in general, representing the robot's shape with gait parameters is sufficient to accurately estimated shape and pose, though it can be improved upon in specific cases by explicitly modeling joint angles.},

	abstract = {Concentric tube robots are continuum robots particularly well-suited for minimally-invasive surgery. Their small diameter, natural free channel and snake-like shape unlock the potential for applications that require a high degree of dexterity in confined spaces. The synthesis and planning of such robots are generally based on the patient's anatomy and the type of surgery to be performed. However, their practical deployment can be challenging. Open-loop approaches are prone to errors due to modeling accuracy or physiological motions of the patient during the procedure, and human-in-the-loop approaches require specific skills from the surgeon. In this article, we propose an automatic tip-steering approach for concentric tube robots based on visual SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping). This allows a closed-loop control scheme to compensate for open-loop errors, and provides to the surgeon the opportunity to focus on the medical procedure, simplifying the management of the deployment. A method is proposed in the case of a robot geometry that achieves approximate follow-the-leader deployment. It is validated by performing an automatic tip-steering task in the trachea using a realistic simulator for concentric tube robots.},

	abstract = {Robotic manipulators for Robot-assisted Minimally Invasive Surgery (RMIS) pass through small incisions into the patient's body and interact with soft internal organs. The performance of traditional robotic manipulators such as the da Vinci Robotic System is limited due to insufficient flexibility of the manipulator and lack of haptic feedback. Modern surgical manipulators have taken inspiration from biology e.g. snakes or the octopus. In order for such soft and flexible arms to reconfigure itself and to control its pose with respect to organs as well as to provide haptic feedback to the surgeon, tactile sensors can be integrated with the robot's flexible structure. The work presented here takes inspiration from another area of biology: cucumber tendrils have shown to be ideal tactile sensors for the plant that they are associated with providing useful environmental information during the plant's growth. Incorporating the sensing principles of cucumber tendrils, we have created miniature sensing elements that can be distributed across the surface of soft manipulators to form a sensor network capable of acquire tactile information. Each sensing element is a retractable hemispherical tactile measuring applied pressure. The actual sensing principle chosen for each tactile makes use of optic fibres that transfer light signals modulated by the applied pressure from the sensing element to the proximal end of the robot arm. In this paper, we describe the design and structure of the sensor system, the results of an analysis using Finite Element Modeling in ABAQUS as well as sensor calibration and experimental results. Due to the simple structure of the proposed tactile sensor element, it is miniaturisable and suitable for MIS. An important contribution of this work is that the developed sensor system can be ”loosely” integrated with a soft arm effectively operating independently of the arm and without affecting the arm's motion during bending or elongation.},

These kinds of manipulators rely on redundancy, making the inverse kinematics very difficult. Therefore, a tip following method is proposed using the sequential quadratic programming optimization approach to navigate the robot. This optimization is used to minimize a set of changes to the arrangement of the snake arm that lets the algorithm follow the desired trajectory with minimal error. The information of the Snake Arm pose is used to limit deviations from the path taken. Therefore, the main objective is to find an efficient objective function that allows uninterrupted movements in real-time. The method proposed is validated through an extensive set of simulations of common arrangements and poses for the snake arm robot. For a 24 DoF robot, the average computation time is 0.4 s, achieving a speed of 4.5 mm/s, with deviation of no more than 25 mm from the ideal path.},

In this research a mobile snake robot with actuated wheels is given the ability to sense its surroundings through its wheels by 3DOF force sensors, so that semi-autonomous control can be realized. This will simplify necessary operator commands and improve situation awareness through information feedback. Even with the many limitations of practical robot design, such as unwanted flexibilities, and measuring while actuating the wheels, the sensor's errors are confirmed to vary between just 1\% and 3\%. Moreover, sensitivity is equal over the wheels, only a 3s calibration at startup is needed, and the sensor is shown to be resistant to aging and temperature change. The sensor is implemented directly into a new snake robot, one sensor in each segment. Its central control will adjust the snake body according to the surroundings while automatically avoiding obstacles and crossing gaps.},

The elongated, laterally-narrow footprint associated with these motion strategies is well-suited to traversal of confined spaces and narrow pathways. Navigation and path planning in the absence of global sensing, however, remains a pivotal challenge to be addressed prior to practical deployment of these robotic mechanisms. Several challenges related to visual processing and localization need to be resolved to to enable navigation. As a first pass in this direction, we equip a wireless, monocular color camera to the head of a robotic snake. Visiual odometry and mapping from ORB-SLAM permits self-localization in planar, obstacle-strewn environments. Ground plane traversability segmentation in conjunction with perception-space collision detection permits path planning for navigation. A previously presented dynamical reduction of rectilinear snake locomotion to a non-holonomic kinematic vehicle informs both SLAM and planning. The simplified motion model is then applied to track planned trajectories through an obstacle configuration. This navigational framework enables a snake-like robotic platform to autonomously navigate and traverse unknown scenarios with only monocular vision.},

	abstract = {Snake robot locomotion in a cluttered environment where the snake robot utilises a sensory-perceptual system to perceive the surrounding operational environment for means of propulsion is defined as perception-driven obstacle-aided locomotion (POAL). From a control point of view, achieving POAL with traditional rigidly-actuated robots is challenging because of the complex interaction between the snake robot and the immediate environment. To simplify the control complexity, compliant motion and fine torque control on each joint is essential. Accordingly, intrinsically elastic joints have become progressively prominent over the last years for a variety robotic applications. Commonly, elastic joints are considered to outperform rigid actuation in terms of peak dynamics, robustness, and energy efficiency. Even though a few examples of elastic snake robots exist, they are generally expensive to manufacture and tailored to custom-made hardware/software components that are not openly available off-the-shelf. In this work, Serpens, a newly-designed low-cost, open-source and highly-compliant multi-purpose modular snake robot with series elastic actuator (SEA) is presented. Serpens features precision torque control and stereoscopic vision. Only low-cost commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components are adopted. The robot modules can be 3D-printed by using Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) manufacturing technology, thus making the rapid-prototyping process very economical and fast. A screw-less assembly mechanism allows for connecting the modules and reconfigure the robot in a very reliable and robust manner. The concept of modularity is also applied to the system architecture on both the software and hardware sides. Each module is independent, being controlled by a self-reliant controller board. The software architecture is based on the Robot Operating System (ROS). This paper describes the design of Serpens and presents preliminary simulation and experimental results, which illustrate its performance.},

Therefore, localization plays a key role in visualization. We propose a new localization method that relies only on the information from joint angles and an IMU. We evaluated the proposed method by comparing it with other methods on a flat ground and on a combination of a plane and a slope with a rough surface. The results demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method in both cases. Then, we examined the visualization system in room environments. The results showed that the proposed system successfully visualized the robot and its surroundings. We also confirmed the effectiveness of the visual aid by the predicted path.},

Next, the parametric cubic spline interpolation path-planning method and potential functions are applied to make the path more smooth so as to prevent the multi-link and elongated robot body from hitting obstacles. To steer, a time-varying line-of-sight control law is designed to ensure that the robot moves to the local target position along the generated path by the perception-aware method. The robot will repeatedly perform the above search-find-move strategy until it reaches the final predefined target point. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate a good performance of the proposed perception-aware approach, that is, the elongated and underactuated snake robot is capable of autonomously navigating in an unknown environment.},

We propose an economic MPC algorithm that maximizes the robot's forward velocity and integrates the choice of the gait pattern into the closed loop. We show recursive feasibility of the MPC optimization problem, where some of the developed techniques are also applicable for the analysis of a more general class of system. Besides, we provide performance results and illustrate the achieved performance by numerical simulations. We thereby show that the economic MPC algorithm outperforms a standard lateral undulation controller and achieves constraint satisfaction.

While MPC has an advantage in that inequality constraints can be explicitly considered in control design, most of the previous simplified models are still too complex to apply to MPC since the models include joint angles as time-varying parameters. Thus, we exclude joint angles using the averaging method to construct a simpler model. Another feature of the proposed model is that it can be derived from the original complex model without parameter identification using simulation data and without assuming straight-line movements. In addition to inequality constraints on joint angles and the frequency of joint motions, we impose constraints on the change rates of these variables in our MPC design since the averaged model is derived by assuming that these variables slowly change. Furthermore, we introduce a soft constraint to decrease the effects of approximation error of the simplified model on the control performance. The effectiveness of the control system is verified in both simulations and experiments.},

Using different height points located on the symmetric centerline of the workspace of the CoM as via points, the CoM trajectory is planned by combining cubic polynomials with Bézier curves based on quadratic Bernstein polynomials. Herein, the system energy consumption is obtained by integrating the product of generalized velocity and generalized force versus time, where the generalized force is calculated by Lagrange’s equation including the Rayleigh dissipation function. Then, two schemes of dynamic rolling are proposed to compare, and the theoretical results show that the system consumes less energy under the sinusoid scheme when the via point height is lower and the via point of higher height is more suitable under the modified trapezoidal curve scheme.

	abstract = {Robots for entertainment are currently very popular, and a variety of systems have been developed. Inspired by the image of snowman and Chinese traditional toy tumbler, we have developed a rolling robot, Loobot, for entertainment. In the shape of a snowman that consists of a spherical head and a spherical body, the robot can dance and move by rolling. Moreover, Loobot supports multiple interactive features such as speech recognition, face tracking and remote communication. Combining these features with the ingenious rolling locomotion makes Loobot more interactive and differentiates the robot from other entertainment robots that are actually screens on wheels. In this paper, we introduce the functions of the rolling robot, focusing on the design and control of its rolling locomotion. The act of rolling is driven by a 2-Dof pendulum with counter-weight (ballast mass) to produce a gravitational torque. Due to its incomplete spherical structure, control of Loobot is different to some extent from that of a spherical robot. Stable dancing and running is a key issue. In existing literature of spherical robots, the dynamic models do not fit in with Loobot. Dynamics of the robot is derived and a simple decoupled stabilization controller is proposed, which is independent on its system parameters.},

Using inspiration from organisms found in nature assists in developing a system that is well-suited for specific tasks and environments. This process is called bio-inspiration. When designing bio-inspired robots, locomotion is one of the most common sources of inspiration. Exploratory robots are often limited to wheels as the mode of transportation, but there are so many more options, each with its own benefits and uses. This work focuses on the design and development of various rolling robots for planetary exploration. Specifically, these rolling robots are being designed for the exploration of the Martian surface. The main source of inspiration for these rovers is the Golden Wheel Spider. This spider is known for its wind-assisted rolling capabilities, allowing it to traverse sand dunes with minimal effort quickly. In addition to prototypes, a dynamical model of the conceptual Spider Rolling Robot (SRR) has been developed. Studies have been done to determine just how much the wind will be able to assist the SRR under realistic conditions on the Martian surface. Finally, CoppeliaSim simulations have been built to test and compare various model designs to find the most effective form of the SRR.},

This concept will explore the rough terrains of Mars and gather data from its deep craters and crevasses that are inaccessible to current landers and rovers. The Golden wheel spider uses rolling down a sloped surface on its legs to escape its predators. The proposed robot will evade obstacles by using a sphere containing several legs on the exterior to contact the ground. When given enough power, the legs will move in concert with the sphere. In this paper, the dynamic properties, fabrication process, and progress will be explored and presented.},

Our robots have some especial moving capabilities causing to increase the robot maneuverability. Indeed, the capability of rolling motion is added to ordinary quadruped robots. This capability causes increment in maneuvering of the robots. Manipulators can be embedded into the robots to add the ability of transferring materials into the shell and conducting some tasks such as repairing. In this paper, after analysis of motion principles of the rolling robots, their dynamic equations are derived. Different simulations of two bioinspired mobile robots are presented in order to scrutinize various capabilities of the proposed designs. Walking capabilities of the robots and their advantages are discussed in detail. The comprehensive simulation results of the robots in various motion modes are presented. Finally the first prototype is introduced to verify the motion mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Planetary surface exploration technology over the past few years has seen significant advancements on multiple fronts. Robotic exploration platforms are becoming more sophisticated and capable of embarking on more challenging missions. More unconventional designs, particularly transforming architectures that have multiple modes of locomotion, are being studied. This work explores the capabilities of one such novel transforming rover called the Transforming Roving-Rolling Explorer (TRREx). Biologically inspired by the armadillo and the golden-wheel spider, the TRREx has two modes of locomotion: it can traverse on six wheels like a conventional rover on benign terrain, but can transform into a sphere when necessary to negotiate steep rugged slopes. The ability to self-propel in the spherical configuration, even in the absence of a negative gradient, increases the TRREx's versatility and its concept value. This paper describes construction and testing of a prototype cylindrical TRREx that demonstrates that “actuated rolling” can be achieved, and also presents a dynamic model of this prototype version of the TRREx that can be used to investigate the feasibility and value of such self-propelled locomotion. Finally, we present results that validate our dynamic model by comparing results from computer simulations made using the dynamic model to experimental results acquired from test runs using the prototype.},

Furthermore, although at least one spider (Hamilton, personal communication) when disturbed forms its body and legs into a sphere and rolls down sand dunes, I have been unable to find examples of animals that roll uphill or even over level terrain. Various coelenterates such as Hydra and some sea anemones somersault slowly across the substrate by alternating attachment of the pedal disk and tentacles.

Tumbleweeds could prove to be a safe and economical way of deploying instruments such as a ground penetrating radar or a magnetometer in numerous hostile environments. The latest version of the rover was recently deployed in Greenland, where it completed a more than 130km autonomous traverse across an ice sheet. Communicating via the Iridium satellite network, the rover in question successfully and reliably relayed live GPS, temperature, and pressure data to a ground station at JPL for nearly ten days. The follow-on rover is currently being readied for a traverse from the South Pole to the coast of Antarctica some 2000km away. The Antarctic test is set to take place in February of 2004 and will serve to verify Tumbleweed as an effective means of harvesting data in extreme and remote settings.},

Here, we present experimental work on traversing steep, granular slopes with the dynamically walking quadrupedal robot SpaceBok. To adapt to the challenging environment, we developed passive-adaptive planar feet and optimized grouser pads to reduce sinkage and increase traction on planar and inclined granular soil. Single-foot experiments revealed that a large surface area of 110cm2 per foot reduces sinkage to an acceptable level even on highly collapsible soil (ES-1). Implementing several 12mm grouser blades increases traction by 22\% to 66\% on granular media compared to grouser-less designs. Together with a terrain-adapting walking controller, we validate - for the first time - static and dynamic locomotion on Mars analog slopes of up to 25\{{\textbackslash}deg\}(the maximum of the testbed). We evaluated the performance between point- and planar feet and static and dynamic gaits regarding stability (safety), velocity, and energy consumption. We show that dynamic gaits are energetically more efficient than static gaits but are riskier on steep slopes. Our tests also revealed that planar feet's energy consumption drastically increases when the slope inclination approaches the soil's angle of internal friction due to shearing. Point feet are less affected by slippage due to their excessive sinkage, but in turn, are prone to instabilities and tripping. We present and discuss safe and energy-efficient global path-planning strategies for accessing steep topography on Mars based on our findings.},

	abstract = {Reconfigurable modular robots have the ability to use different gaits and configurations to perform various tasks. A rolling gait is the fastest currently implemented gait available for traversal over level ground and shows dramatic improvements in efficiency. In this work, we analyze and implement a sensor-based feedback controller to achieve dynamic rolling for a loop robot. The robot senses its position relative to the ground and changes its shape as it rolls. This shape is such that its center of gravity is maintained to be in front of its contact point with the ground, so in effect the robot is continuously falling and thus accelerates forward. Using simulation and experimental results, we show how the desired shape can be varied to achieve higher terminal velocities. The highest velocity achieved in this work is 26 module lengths per second (1.6 m/s) which is believed to be the fastest gait yet implemented for an untethered modular robot. One of the major findings is that more elongated shapes achieve higher terminal velocities than rounder shapes. We demonstrate that this trend holds going up inclines as well as down. We show that rounder shapes have lower specific resistance and are thus more energy efficient. The control scheme is scalable to an arbitrary number of modules, shown here using eight to 14 modules.},

In particular, desert-dwelling sidewinder rattlesnakes (Crotalus cerastes) operate effectively on inclined granular media (such as sand dunes) that induce failure in field-tested limbless robots through slipping and pitching. Our laboratory experiments reveal that as granular incline angle increases, sidewinder rattlesnakes increase the length of their body in contact with the sand. Implementing this strategy in a physical robot model of the snake enables the device to ascend sandy slopes close to the angle of maximum slope stability. Plate drag experiments demonstrate that granular yield stresses decrease with increasing incline angle.

	abstract = {Aiming at how to achieve optimal control of joint pitch angles in the process of the robot surmounting obstacle, taking the developed coal mine rescue snake robot as an experimental platform, a pose control algorithm based on particle swarm optimization weight coefficient of extreme learning machine (PSOELM) is proposed. In order to obtain the optimized hidden layer matrix of the extreme learning machine (ELM), particle swarm optimization (PSO) is applied to optimize the weight coefficient of hidden layer matrix. The simulation and experiment results prove that, compared with the ELM algorithm, the smaller mean square error (MSE) between the joint pitch angles of robot and the expected values is acquired by the PSOELM, which overcomes the shortcoming that traditional extreme learning machine cannot reach the best performance because of the random selection of the parameters of the hidden layer nodes. PSOELM is superior to ELM algorithm in control accuracy, fast searching for the optimal and stability. Optimal control of robot’s joint pitch angles is achieved. The algorithm is applied to the surmounting obstacle control of the developed snake robot, and it lays the foundation for further implement of the coal mine rescue.},

Instead of starting from a pre-defined movement pattern such as a serpenoid curve, we use a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach to automatically generate effective locomotion gaits via trajectory optimization. An important advantage of this approach is that the resulting gaits are automatically adapted to the environment that is being modeled as part of the snake dynamics. To illustrate this, we use a novel model for anisotropic dry friction, along with existing models for viscous friction and fluid dynamic effects such as drag and added mass. For each of these models, gaits generated without any change in the method or its parameters are as efficient as Pareto-optimal serpenoid gaits tuned individually for each environment. Furthermore, the proposed method can also produce more complex or irregular gaits, e.g. for obstacle avoidance or executing sharp turns.},

The robot is equipped with a simple but effective control mechanism that can modulate the stroke plane for attitude stabilization and control. Due to the demand for extended flight, we performed a series of experiments on the lift generation and power requirement of the robot with different stroke amplitudes and wing areas. We show that a larger wing with less inboard wing area improves the lift-to-power ratio and produces a peak lift-to-weight ratio of 1.34 at 3.7 V application. Flight tests show that the robot employing the selected wing could hover for 8.8 minutes. Moreover, the robot could perform maneuvers in any direction, fly outdoors, and carry payload, demonstrating its ability to enter the next phase of autonomous flight.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a universal adaptive controller for quadcopters, which can be deployed zero-shot to quadcopters of very different mass, arm lengths and motor constants, and also shows rapid adaptation to unknown disturbances during runtime. The core algorithmic idea is to learn a single policy that can adapt online at test time not only to the disturbances applied to the drone, but also to the robot dynamics and hardware in the same framework. We achieve this by training a neural network to estimate a latent representation of the robot and environment parameters, which is used to condition the behaviour of the controller, also represented as a neural network. We train both networks exclusively in simulation with the goal of flying the quadcopters to goal positions and avoiding crashes to the ground. We directly deploy the same controller trained in the simulation without any modifications on two quadcopters with differences in mass, inertia, and maximum motor speed of up to 4 times. In addition, we show rapid adaptation to sudden and large disturbances (up to 35.7\%) in the mass and inertia of the quadcopters. We perform an extensive evaluation in both simulation and the physical world, where we outperform a state-of-the-art learning-based adaptive controller and a traditional PID controller specifically tuned to each platform individually.

To enable a future Mars Science Helicopter to perform in-flight loop closures, we present an on-board visual loop closure detection system based on a Bag-of-Words (BoW) approach that is efficient enough to run in real-time on the anticipated computationally constrained flight avionics. Our system establishes image-to-image associations between incoming images of a downward-looking navigation camera and previously observed geo-tagged keyframes stored in a database. The system extracts ORB features which are quantized into a BoW histogram using a custom 1 million words hierarchical vocabulary, trained on synthetic images from a Mars simulation. An efficient database query using an inverted index produces a set of candidate frames which we check for geometrical consistency. For efficient feature matching, we leverage the vocabulary to perform fast approximate nearest neighbor search. The geometrical check accepts loop closure pairs whose essential matrix is supported by a minimum number of feature matches, which are pre-selected based on a rotational consistency check. The vocabulary and the methods used for the geometrical consistency checks were chosen to maximize the performance while allowing single-thread real-time execution on a computationally constrained embedded processor. We demonstrate and evaluate the proposed system both on simulated and real-world data, including flight data from the Mars Helicopter Ingenuity.},

	abstract = {Legged robot locomotion is a challenging task due to a myriad of sub-problems, such as the hybrid dynamics of foot contact and the effects of the desired gait on the terrain. Accurate and efficient state estimation of the floating base and the feet joints can help alleviate much of these issues by providing feedback information to robot controllers. Current state estimation methods are highly reliant on a conjunction of visual and inertial measurements to provide real-time estimates, thus being handicapped in perceptually poor environments. In this work, we show that by leveraging the kinematic chain model of the robot via a factor graph formulation, we can perform state estimation of the base and the leg joints using primarily proprioceptive inertial data. We perform state estimation using a combination of preintegrated IMU measurements, forward kinematic computations, and contact detections in a factor-graph based framework, allowing our state estimate to be constrained by the robot model. Experimental results in simulation and on hardware show that our approach out-performs current proprioceptive state estimation methods by 27\% on average, while being generalizable to a variety of legged robot platforms. We demonstrate our results both quantitatively and qualitatively on a wide variety of trajectories.},

	abstract = {This article aims at collecting and discussing the results reached by the research community regarding the study of the ground effect on small rotorcraft unmanned aerial vehicles, especially from the modeling and control point of view. Rotorcraft performance is affected by the presence of the ground or any other boundary that alters the flow into the rotors. Specifically, the ground effect can induce perturbations in the flight stability, when operating near the ground. For a rotorcraft, an accident is likely to happen when the vehicle leaves or enters the ground effect region, which may cause crashes and property damages. Today, the use of unmanned aerial vehicles has grown widespread, which raises safety concerns when they are flying at very low altitudes and near the ground. Consequently, studying the influence of the ground over rotorcrafts is of paramount importance for general safety. Also, these investigations can be used to design systems of guidance, navigation, and control. In this review, we break down the most relevant works to date. We discuss aspects related to modeling, control, and application of the ground effect for small-scale multirotors, as well as other aerodynamic proximity effects, such as the ceiling and wall effects. We conclude by mentioning potential avenues of research when studying the ground effect from the point of view of the robotics and artificial intelligence fields.},

In this paper, we highlight three insights provided by our new data structure. First, the Bayes tree provides a better understanding of the matrix factorization in terms of probability densities. Second, we show how the fairly abstract updates to a matrix factorization translate to a simple editing of the Bayes tree and its conditional densities. Third, we apply the Bayes tree to obtain a completely novel algorithm for sparse nonlinear incremental optimization, named iSAM2, which achieves improvements in efficiency through incremental variable re-ordering and fluid relinearization, eliminating the need for periodic batch steps. We analyze various properties of iSAM2 in detail, and show on a range of real and simulated datasets that our algorithm compares favorably with other recent mapping algorithms in both quality and efficiency.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a visual-inertial odometry framework that tightly fuses inertial measurements with visual data from one or more cameras, by means of an iterated extended Kalman filter. By employing image patches as landmark descriptors, a photometric error is derived, which is directly integrated as an innovation term in the filter update step. Consequently, the data association is an inherent part of the estimation process and no additional feature extraction or matching processes are required. Furthermore, it enables the tracking of noncorner-shaped features, such as lines, and thereby increases the set of possible landmarks. The filter state is formulated in a fully robocentric fashion, which reduces errors related to nonlinearities. This also includes partitioning of a landmark’s location estimate into a bearing vector and distance and thereby allows an undelayed initialization of landmarks. Overall, this results in a compact approach, which exhibits a high level of robustness with respect to low scene texture and motion blur. Furthermore, there is no time-consuming initialization procedure and pose estimates are available starting at the second image frame. We test the filter on different real datasets and compare it with other state-of-the-art visual-inertial frameworks. Experimental results show that robust localization with high accuracy can be achieved with this filter-based framework.},

This letter presents an aerial robotic platform for performing source term estimation of an unknown chemical release in a challenging a-priori unknown and GPS-denied environment. The proposed system forms the search strategy using the state-of-the-art control concept, dual control for exploitation and exploration, and realises such a function in the aforementioned challenging scenario using an RRT* based path planner. A novel downsampling process on the RRT* is also proposed that addresses the computational infeasibility of calculating the utility of a large number of sample states, whilst still maintaining sample state diversity. The proposed algorithm is tested in a high fidelity simulation environment under a number of configurations, and compared against competing algorithms. The system architecture is also brought forward into a bespoke UAV platform and experimentally tested in real-world conditions. The proposed system is shown to be capable of performing source term estimation robustly and efficiently, which provides a step forward in showing the real world application of previously academic functions.},

Several bird species solve this problem by changing the shape of their wings to adapt to the different aerodynamic requirements. Here, we describe a novel morphing wing design composed of artificial feathers that can rapidly modify its geometry to fulfil different aerodynamic requirements. We show that a fully deployed configuration enhances manoeuvrability while a folded configuration offers low drag at high speeds and is beneficial in strong headwinds. We also show that asymmetric folding of the wings can be used for roll control of the drone. The aerodynamic performance of the morphing wing is characterized in simulations, in wind tunnel measurements and validated in outdoor flights with a small drone.},

	abstract = {Many current bird-inspired flapping-wing air vehicles (FWAVs) achieve their flight characteristics through deformations associated with compliant wings during the flapping cycle. Most FWAVs use a single actuator to flap both wings. This couples and synchronizes motions of the wings, which only provides variable rate flapping at constant amplitude to control wing deformations. Independent wing control has the potential to provide a greater flight envelope through the ability to program wing motions to achieve a desired wing shape and associated aerodynamic forces. This approach requires the use of at least two actuators with position and velocity control that can be programmed to drive the wings independently. Integration of two actuators in a flying platform significantly increases the weight and hence makes it challenging to achieve flight. Based on our previous designs with synchronized wing flapping, we developed a new FWAV platform using programmable digital servo motors and a compatible highly compliant wing design that enables shape control of the wings during the flapping cycle. The wings and flapping characteristics can generate the highest possible lift near the maximum power operating point for the servos. The servos were integrated into a wing drive subsystem consisting of 3D printed and laser-etched/cut structural components to reduce part count and weight. A servo-driven tail was also used to augment the steering control and lift of the FWAV. The platform reported in this article, known as Robo Raven, was the first demonstration of a bird-inspired platform doing outdoor aerobatics using independently actuated and controlled wings. This platform successfully performed dives, flips, and buttonhook turns, demonstrating the capability of bioinspired aerobatic maneuvers afforded by the new design.},

	abstract = {DASH+Wings is a small hexapedal winged robot that uses flapping wings to increase its locomotion capabilities. To examine the effects of flapping wings, multiple experimental controls for the same locomotor platform are provided by wing removal, by the use of inertially similar lateral spars, and by passive rather than actively flapping wings. We used accelerometers and high-speed cameras to measure the performance of this hybrid robot in both horizontal running and while ascending inclines. To examine consequences of wing flapping for aerial performance, we measured lift and drag forces on the robot at constant airspeeds and body orientations in a wind tunnel; we also determined equilibrium glide performance in free flight. The addition of flapping wings increased the maximum horizontal running speed from 0.68 to 1.29 m s−1, and also increased the maximum incline angle of ascent from 5.6° to 16.9°. Free flight measurements show a decrease of 10.3° in equilibrium glide slope between the flapping and gliding robot. In air, flapping improved the mean lift:drag ratio of the robot compared to gliding at all measured body orientations and airspeeds. Low-amplitude wing flapping thus provides advantages in both cursorial and aerial locomotion. We note that current support for the diverse theories of avian flight origins derive from limited fossil evidence, the adult behavior of extant flying birds, and developmental stages of already volant taxa. By contrast, addition of wings to a cursorial robot allows direct evaluation of the consequences of wing flapping for locomotor performance in both running and flying.},

We discuss the accelerations in the context of the traditional spring-loaded inverted pendulum model seen in nearly all legged locomotion in organisms. Flapping wings are shown to provide damping along with propulsive force. The aerodynamic forces of the flapping wings also impart passive stability to the robot, enabling it to run bipedally with only a single actuator. BOLT transitions from ground running to aerial hovering in as little as one meter of runway. Overall, the advantages provided by wings in terrestrial locomotion, coupled with aerial capabilities, allow BOLT to navigate complex three dimensional environments, switching between locomotion modes when necessary.},

	abstract = {For an insect-like tailless flying robot, flapping wings should be able to produce control force as well as flight force to keep the robot staying airborne. This capability requires an active control mechanism, which should be integrated with lightweight microcontrol actuators that can produce sufficient control torques to stabilize the robot due to its inherent instability. In this work, we propose a control mechanism integrated in a hover-capable, two-winged, flapping-wing, 16.4 g flying robot (KUBeetle-S) that can simultaneously change the wing stroke-plane and wing twist. Tilting the stroke plane causes changes in the direction of average thrust and the wing twist distribution to produce control torques for pitch and roll. For yaw (heading change), root spars of left and right wings are adjusted asymmetrically to change the wing twist during flapping motion, resulting in yaw torque generation. Changes in wing kinematics were validated by measuring wing kinematics using three synchronized high-speed cameras. We then performed a series of experiments using a six-axis force/torque load cell to evaluate the effectiveness of the control mechanism via torque generation. We prototyped the robot by integrating the control mechanism with sub-micro servos as control actuators and flight control board. Free flight tests were finally conducted to verify the possibility of attitude control.},

We design, construct and test-fly a prototype that opens and closes four wings, resembling the motions of swimming jellyfish more so than any insect or bird. Measurements of lift show the benefits of wing flexing and the importance of selecting a wing size appropriate to the motor. Furthermore, we use high-speed video and motion tracking to show that the body orientation is stable during ascending, forward and hovering flight modes. Our experimental measurements are used to inform an aerodynamic model of stability that reveals the importance of centre-of-mass location and the coupling of body translation and rotation. These results show the promise of flapping-flight strategies beyond those that directly mimic the wing motions of flying animals.},

The approach motivates a gripper design that emphasizes compliance and is passively triggered for a fast response. The resulting gripper is lightweight (23 g) and closes within 12 ms.

	abstract = {Autonomous micro aerial vehicles still struggle with fast and agile maneuvers, dynamic environments, imperfect sensing, and state estimation drift. Autonomous drone racing brings these challenges to the fore. Human pilots can fly a previously unseen track after a handful of practice runs. In contrast, state-of-the-art autonomous navigation algorithms require either a precise metric map of the environment or a large amount of training data collected in the track of interest. To bridge this gap, we propose an approach that can fly a new track in a previously unseen environment without a precise map or expensive data collection. Our approach represents the global track layout with coarse gate locations, which can be easily estimated from a single demonstration flight. At test time, a convolutional network predicts the poses of the closest gates along with their uncertainty. These predictions are incorporated by an extended Kalman filter to maintain optimal maximum-a-posteriori estimates of gate locations. This allows the framework to cope with misleading high-variance estimates that could stem from poor observability or lack of visible gates. Given the estimated gate poses, we use model predictive control to quickly and accurately navigate through the track. We conduct extensive experiments in the physical world, demonstrating agile and robust flight through complex and diverse previously-unseen race tracks.

	abstract = {Payload manipulation with aerial robots has been an active research area for many years. Recent approaches have sought to plan, control, and execute maneuvers with large, yet deliberate, load swings for more agile, energy-optimal maneuvering. Unfortunately, the system's nonlinear dynamics make executing such trajectories a significant challenge and experimental demonstrations thus far have relied completely on a motion capture system and non-negligible simplifications like restriction of the system to a two-dimensional workspace or closing of the control loop on the quadrotor, instead of the payload. In this work, we observe the payload using a downward-facing camera and estimate its state relative to the quadrotor using an extended Kalman filter. We demonstrate closed-loop payload control in the full three-dimensional workspace, with the planning, estimation, and control pipeline implemented on an onboard processor. We show control of load swings up to 53o from the vertical axis. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first realization of closed-loop control of agile slung-load maneuvers and the largest achieved payload angle.},

The flapping wings generate complex wake structures that influence the aerodynamic forces, which can be difficult to model. While it is possible to model these forces using fluid-structure interaction, it is very computationally expensive and difficult to formulate. In this paper, we follow a simpler approach by deriving the aerodynamic forces using a relatively small number of states and presenting them in a simple state-space form. The formulation utilizes Prandtl's lifting line theory and Wagner's function to determine the unsteady aerodynamic forces acting on the wing in a simulation, which then are compared to experimental data of the bat-inspired robot called the Aerobat. The simulated trailing-edge vortex shedding can be evaluated from this model, which then can be analyzed for a wake-based gait design approach to improve the aerodynamic performance of the robot.},

	abstract = {Fluidic locomotion of flapping Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) can be very complex, particularly when the rules from insect flight dynamics (fast flapping dynamics and light wings) are not applicable. In these situations, widely used averaging techniques can fail quickly. The primary motivation is to find efficient models for complex forms of aerial locomotion where wings constitute a large part of body mass (i.e., dominant inertial effects) and deform in multiple directions (i.e., morphing wing). In these systems, high degrees of freedom yields complex inertial, Coriolis, and gravity terms. We use Algorithmic Differentiation (AD) and Bayesian filters computed with cubature rules conjointly to quickly estimate complex fluid-structure interactions. In general, Bayesian filters involve finding complex numerical integration (e.g., find posterior integrals). Using cubature rules to compute Gaussian-weighted integrals and AD, we show that the complex multi-degrees-of-freedom dynamics of morphing MAVs can be computed very efficiently and accurately. Therefore, our work facilitates closed-loop feedback control of these morphing MAVs.},

A Bat, in particular, has a very articulated armwing mechanism with high degrees-of-freedom and flexibility which allows the animal to perform highly dynamic and complex maneuvers, such as upside-down perching. This paper presents the derivation of a multi-body dynamical system of a bio-inspired bat robot called Aerobat which captures multiple biologically meaningful degrees-of-freedom for flapping flight that is present in biological bats. Then, the work attempts to manifest closed-loop aerial body reorientation and preparation for landing through the manipulation of inertial dynamics and aerodynamics by enforcing nonholonomic constraints onto the system. The proposed design paradigm assumes for rapidly exponentially stable controllers that enforce holonomic constraints in the joint space of the model. A model and optimization-based nonlinear controller is applied to resolve the joint trajectories such that the desired angular momentum about the roll axis is achieved.},

In contrast with other flying vertebrates, bats have an extremely articulated musculoskeletal system, key to their body impact-survivability and deliver an impressively adaptive and multimodal locomotion behavior. Bats exclusively use this capability with structural flexibility to generate the controlled force distribution on each wing membrane. The wing flexibility, complex wing kinematics, and fast muscle actuation allow these creatures to change the body configuration within a few tens of milliseconds. These characteristics are crucial to the unrivaled agility of bats and copying them can potentially transform the state-of-the-art aerial drone design.},

In previous, work we have designed the topological structure for the wing kinematics of this robot; here we present methods to optimize the geometry of this structure, and to compute actuator trajectories such that its wingbeat pattern closely matches biological counterparts. Our approach is motivated by recent studies on biological bat flight that have shown that the salient aspects of wing motion can be accurately represented in a low-dimensional space. Although bats have over 40 degrees of freedom (DoFs), our robot possesses several biologically meaningful morphing specializations. We use principal component analysis (PCA) to characterize the two most dominant modes of biological bat flight kinematics, and we optimize our robot’s parametric kinematics to mimic these. The method yields a robot that is reduced from five degrees of actuation (DoAs) to just three, and that actively folds its wings within a wingbeat period. As a result of mimicking synergies, the robot produces an average net lift improvesment of 89\% over the same robot when its wings cannot fold.},

	abstract = {Recent works have shown success in mimicking the flapping flight of bats on the robotic platform Bat Bot (B2). This robot has only five actuators but retains the ability to flap and fold-unfold its wings in flight. However, this bat-like robot has been unable to perform folding-unfolding of its wings within the period of a wingbeat cycle, about 100 ms. The DC motors operating the spindle mechanisms cannot attain this folding speed. Biological bats rely on this periodic folding of their wings during the upstroke of the wingbeat cycle. It reduces the moment of inertia of the wings and limits the negative lift generated during the upstroke. Thus, we consider it important to achieve wing folding during the upstroke. A mechanism was designed to couple the flapping cycle to the folding cycle of the robot. We then use biological data to further optimize the mechanism such that the kinematic synergies of the robot best match those of a biological bat. This ensures that folding is performed at the correct point in the wingbeat cycle.},

As a result, they sense different accelerations when the platform is subjected to rotational motions. In this work, we derive a method for spatially calibrating multiple IMUs in a single estimator based on the open-source camera/IMU calibration toolbox kalibr.

Many applications require absolute localization in a known reference frame, such as the execution of waypoint trajectories defined by human operators. Classical geometric methods build a map of point features, which may not be able to be associated after lighting or environmental changes. By contrast, semantics remain invariant to changes up to the robustness of the detection algorithm and motion of the semantic objects. In this work, we describe our approaches for both offline semantic map generation as well as online localization against a semantic map, intended to run in real-time on the robot. We additionally demonstrate how our semantic localizer outperforms image-feature matching in some cases, and show the robustness of the algorithm to environmental changes. Crucially, we show in our experiments that when semantics are used to supplement point features, localization is always improved. To our knowledge, these experiments demonstrate the first use of learned semantics for localization on a free-flying robot in microgravity.},

In this paper, we present VINS-Mono: a robust and versatile monocular visual-inertial state estimator. Our approach starts with a robust procedure for estimator initialization. A tightly coupled, nonlinear optimization-based method is used to obtain highly accurate visual-inertial odometry by fusing preintegrated IMU measurements and feature observations. A loop detection module, in combination with our tightly coupled formulation, enables relocalization with minimum computation. We additionally perform 4-DOF pose graph optimization to enforce the global consistency. Furthermore, the proposed system can reuse a map by saving and loading it in an efficient way. The current and previous maps can be merged together by the global pose graph optimization. We validate the performance of our system on public datasets and real-world experiments and compare against other state-of-the-art algorithms. We also perform an onboard closed-loop autonomous flight on the microaerial-vehicle platform and port the algorithm to an iOS-based demonstration. We highlight that the proposed work is a reliable, complete, and versatile system that is applicable for different applications that require high accuracy in localization. We open source our implementations for both PCs (https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mono) and iOS mobile devices ( https://github.com/HKUST-Aerial-Robotics/VINS-Mobile).},

	abstract = {This paper presents ORB-SLAM3, the first system able to perform visual, visual-inertial and multi-map SLAM with monocular, stereo and RGB-D cameras, using pin-hole and fisheye lens models. The first main novelty is a feature-based tightly-integrated visual-inertial SLAM system that fully relies on Maximum-a-Posteriori (MAP) estimation, even during the IMU initialization phase. The result is a system that operates robustly in real-time, in small and large, indoor and outdoor environments, and is 2 to 5 times more accurate than previous approaches. The second main novelty is a multiple map system that relies on a new place recognition method with improved recall. Thanks to it, ORB-SLAM3 is able to survive to long periods of poor visual information: when it gets lost, it starts a new map that will be seamlessly merged with previous maps when revisiting mapped areas. Compared with visual odometry systems that only use information from the last few seconds, ORB-SLAM3 is the first system able to reuse in all the algorithm stages all previous information. This allows to include in bundle adjustment co-visible keyframes, that provide high parallax observations boosting accuracy, even if they are widely separated in time or if they come from a previous mapping session. Our experiments show that, in all sensor configurations, ORB-SLAM3 is as robust as the best systems available in the literature, and significantly more accurate. Notably, our stereo-inertial SLAM achieves an average accuracy of 3.6 cm on the EuRoC drone and 9 mm under quick hand-held motions in the room of TUM-VI dataset, a setting representative of AR/VR scenarios. For the benefit of the community we make public the source code.},

An emerging application that stress-tests the challenges of ML system design is tiny robot learning, the deployment of ML on resource-constrained low-cost autonomous robots. Tiny robot learning lies at the intersection of embedded systems, robotics, and ML, compounding the challenges of these domains. Tiny robot learning is subject to challenges from size, weight, area, and power (SWAP) constraints; sensor, actuator, and compute hardware limitations; end-to-end system tradeoffs; and a large diversity of possible deployment scenarios. Tiny robot learning requires ML models to be designed with these challenges in mind, providing a crucible that reveals the necessity of holistic ML system design and automated end-to-end design tools for agile development.

	abstract = {Autonomous lightweight flapping-wing robots show potential to become a safe and affordable solution for rapidly deploying robots around humans and in complex environments. The absence of propellers makes such vehicles more resistant to physical contact, permitting flight in cluttered environments, and collaborating with humans. Importantly, the provision of thousands of species of birds that have already mastered the challenging task of flapping flight is a rich source of solutions. However, small wing flapping technology is still in its beginnings, with limited levels of autonomy and physical interaction capability with the environment. One significant limitation to this is the low payload available. Here we show the Eagle-inspired Flapping-wing robot E-Flap, a 510 g novel design capable of a 100\% of payload, exceeding the requirement of the computing and sensing package needed to fly with a high degree of autonomy. The concept is extensively characterized, both in a tracked indoor space and in outdoor conditions. We demonstrate flight path angle of up to 50° and velocities from as low as 2 m/s to over 6 m/s. Overall, the robotic platform has been proven to be reliable, having performed over 100 flights. Through mechanical and electronics advances, the E-Flap is a robust vehicle prototype and paves the way towards flapping-wing robots becoming a practical fully autonomous flying solution.

To validate the design, the author demonstrated steering actuation in flight, as well as hovering position control using motion capture feedback. Analysis and preliminary experiment additionally suggests that the robot may be passively stable in attitude. The letter concludes by proposing a minimal set of components the robot would need to carry to achieve either sensor-autonomous flight, or power autonomous flight powered by supercapacitors. In both cases, earlier two-winged designs do not have enough lift. This robot therefore represents a mechanical platform that is well-suited to future sensor- and power-autonomous insect robots.},

Most optical flow sensing experimental work has been done on mobile platforms which are relatively steady in rotation, unlike the pitching motion expected on flapping wing flyers. In order to assess the feasibility of using optical flow to control an indoor flapping flyer, an 7 gram commercially available ornithopter airframe was equipped with on-board camera and CPU module with mass of 2.5 grams and 2.6 gram battery. An experiment was conducted capturing optical flow information during flapping and gliding flight on the same platform. As expected, flapping introduced substantial systematic bias to the direction estimates to the point of flipping the true direction periodically. Nonetheless, since the optical flow results oscillated at the same frequency as the flapping wings, it is envisioned that one could disambiguate the jittering optic flow measurements by correlating these with real-time feedback from the motor current.},

Our prototype has a total mass of 22 g, a wing span of 21 cm and a flapping frequency of 22 Hz; it is actively stabilized in pitch and roll by changing the wing camber with a mechanism known as wing twist modulation. The proposed design of wing twist modulation effectively alters the mean lift vector with respect to the center of gravity by reorganization of the airflow. This mechanism is modulated by an onboard control board which calculates the corrective feedback control signals through a closed-loop PD controller in order to stabilize the robot. Currently, there is no control on the yaw axis which is passively stable, and the vertical position is controlled manually by tuning the flapping frequency. The paper describes the recent evolution of the various sub-systems: the wings, the flapping mechanism, the generation of control torques, the avionics and the PD control. The robot has demonstrated successful hovering flights with an on-board battery for the flight autonomy of 15–20 s.},

A complete lifting line theory of flight in ground effect with a fixed wing is developed, and instructions are given so that it may be applied to animals such as skimmers, pelicans and myotid bats which fly and forage close above water. Several predictions are made about likely flight behaviour in ground effect, and about the appropriate flight morphology for taking advantage of the potential performance improvements. The most important conclusion, differing from previous analyses, is that slow flight performance in ground effect is very poor, owing to the horizontal air velocity induced around the wing in the presence of the ground.},

Here, we present an open source high fidelity dynamic simulation for FWMAVs. The simulator serves as a testbed for the design, optimization and flight control of FWMAVs. To validate the simulation, we recreated the at-scale hummingbird robot developed in our lab in the simulation. System identification was performed to obtain the model parameters. Force generation and dynamic response of open-loop and closed loop systems between simulated and experimental flights were compared. The unsteady aerodynamics and the highly nonlinear flight dynamics present challenging control problems for conventional and learning control algorithms such as Reinforcement Learning. The interface of the simulation is fully compatible with OpenAI Gym environment. As a benchmark study, we present a linear controller for hovering stabilization and a Deep Reinforcement Learning control policy for goal-directed maneuvering. Finally, we demonstrate direct simulation-to-real transfer of both control policies onto the physical robot, further demonstrating the fidelity of the simulation.},

Conventional actuators for manufacturing applications have difficulty satisfying design requirements for high-speed locomotion, such as the need for high torque density and the ability to manage dynamic physical interactions. To address this challenge, this paper suggests a proprioceptive actuation paradigm that enables highly dynamic performance in legged machines. Proprioceptive actuation uses collocated force control at the joints to effectively control contact interactions at the feet under dynamic conditions. Modal analysis of a reduced leg model and dimensional analysis of DC motors address the main principles for implementation of this paradigm. In the realm of legged machines, this paradigm provides a unique combination of high torque density, high-bandwidth force control, and the ability to mitigate impacts through backdrivability. We introduce a new metric named the “impact mitigation factor” (IMF) to quantify backdrivability at impact, which enables design comparison across a wide class of robots. The MIT Cheetah leg is presented, and is shown to have an IMF that is comparable to other quadrupeds with series springs to handle impact. The design enables the Cheetah to control contact forces during dynamic bounding, with contact times down to 85 ms and peak forces over 450 N. The unique capabilities of the MIT Cheetah, achieving impact-robust force-controlled operation in high-speed three-dimensional running and jumping, suggest wider implementation of this holistic actuation approach.},

The presented data include measurements from onboard sensors widely used in aerial robotics and suitable to deal with the perception challenges of flapping-wing robots, such as an event camera, a conventional camera, and two Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), as well as ground truth measurements from a laser tracker or a motion capture system. A total of 21 datasets of different types of flights were collected in three different scenarios (one indoor and two outdoor).

Previous iterations have demonstrated controlled flight but were difficult to fabricate because they consisted of many separate parts assembled together and were also unable to perform locomotion modes besides flight. This article presents a new design of a 74-mg flapping-wing robot that dramatically reduces the number of parts and simplifies fabrication. The robot also has a lower center of mass, which allows the robot to additionally land without the need for long legs, even in case of unstable flight. We also show that the new design allows for wing-driven ground and air–water interfacial locomotion, improving the versatility of the robot. During surface ambulation, forward thrust is generated by increasing the speed of the upstroke relative to the downstroke of the flapping wings. Adjusting relative wing stroke amplitudes also allows for steering. The ability to land and subsequently move along the ground first presented here allows the robot to negotiate extremely confined spaces and underneath obstacles. We present results demonstrating these capabilities, as well as hovering flight and controlled landing.},

It was powered by two 1-farad super capacitors. Due to the rapid discharge of the capacitor power source, the flight duration was limited. To achieve a longer flight, a rechargeable battery as a power source is preferred. The second prototype houses a small 3-gram rechargeable Ni-Cad battery. The best flight performance for this prototype lasted 22 seconds. The latest and current prototype is radio-controlled and is capable of turning left or right, pitching up or down. It weighs approximately 12.5 grams. So far, the best flight duration achieved is 42 seconds.

Here we use an analytical method to determine the inertial characteristics of 22 species across the full range of elbow and wrist flexion and extension. We find that wing morphing allows birds to substantially change their roll and yaw inertia but has a minimal effect on the position of the centre of gravity. With the addition of inertial characteristics, we derived a novel metric of pitch agility and estimated the static pitch stability, revealing that the agility and static margin ranges are reduced as body mass increases. These results provide quantitative evidence that evolution selects for both stable and unstable flight, in contrast to the prevailing narrative that birds are evolving away from stability

To minimize leg odometry drift, we extend the robot's state with a linear velocity bias term which is estimated online. This bias is observable because of the tight fusion of this preintegrated velocity factor with vision, lidar, and IMU factors. Extensive experimental validation on different ANYmal quadruped robots is presented, for a total duration of 2 h and 1.8 km traveled. The experiments involved dynamic locomotion over loose rocks, slopes, and mud which caused challenges like slippage and terrain deformation. Perceptual challenges included dark and dusty underground caverns, and open and feature-deprived areas.

These applications are often subjected to ﬂights in the proximity of walls or ground that generate external forces and torques on the vehicle due to aerodynamic effects, because of what strong safety guarantees are required. In this research a methodology based on dynamic meshes was developed and applied to computational simulations to reproduce the ﬂight of the drone over an obstacle. Thus, the effect of the ground proximity on the drone performance was assessed, and also its combination with the ﬂow around the body at different translational velocities. The results shown a decrease of the drag force, and an increase of the lift and forward pitch moment due to the presence of the ground. These effects are magniﬁed by the translational velocity, which also deviates the ﬂow generated by the propellers and delays the interaction with the obstacle. Both in the approaching and leaving to the obstacle, increases of up to 60\% in the pitch moment are observed. This sudden variations must be properly counteracted to guarantee the stability and safety of the drone operation.},

Recently, learning-based control policies have been proposed for quadrotors, as they would potentially allow learning direct mappings from high-dimensional raw sensory observations to actions. Due to sample inefficiency, training such learned controllers on the real platform is impractical or even impossible. Training in simulation is attractive but requires to transfer policies between domains, which demands trained policies to be robust to such domain gap. In this work, we make two contributions: (i) we perform the first benchmark comparison of existing learned control policies for agile quadrotor flight and show that training a control policy that commands body-rates and thrust results in more robust sim-to-real transfer compared to a policy that directly specifies individual rotor thrusts, (ii) we demonstrate for the first time that such a control policy trained via deep reinforcement learning can control a quadrotor in real-world experiments at speeds over 45km/h.},

	abstract = {Mobile robot navigation is typically regarded as a geometric problem, in which the robot's objective is to perceive the geometry of the environment in order to plan collision-free paths towards a desired goal. However, a purely geometric view of the world can can be insufficient for many navigation problems. For example, a robot navigating based on geometry may avoid a field of tall grass because it believes it is untraversable, and will therefore fail to reach its desired goal. In this work, we investigate how to move beyond these purely geometric-based approaches using a method that learns about physical navigational affordances from experience. Our approach, which we call BADGR, is an end-to-end learning-based mobile robot navigation system that can be trained with self-supervised off-policy data gathered in real-world environments, without any simulation or human supervision. BADGR can navigate in real-world urban and off-road environments with geometrically distracting obstacles. It can also incorporate terrain preferences, generalize to novel environments, and continue to improve autonomously by gathering more data.

	title = {Quadrupedal {Robots} for {Planetary} {Exploration}},
	abstract = {So far, mobile, robotic exploration of celestial bodies has been performed solely with wheeled systems, making access to highly unstructured, compressible, and sloped areas very challenging. Additionally, the systems have to account for unknowns, such as unclear soil properties or the environment in uncharted areas such as caves. Scientists, however, have identified those challenging places as potential targets for future missions. Meanwhile, versatile, terrestrial walking robots have advanced rapidly over the last decade and have reached a maturity level where the commercial application becomes viable. Thus, it is only a matter of time until walking robots will be used to explore so far unreachable areas in our solar system. Nevertheless, it is still unclear which underlying technologies need to be adapted and further developed for space and how such a robot would look like. In this thesis, we investigate legged systems in the context of space exploration. We were particularly interested in increasing and validating the system performance in partially unknown, sandy, sloped, and lower-than-earth gravity settings. We analyze the state-of-the-art of legged robots and the scalability of underlying technologies in view of future missions and carried out initial simulation studies and field trials. The studies revealed that dynamic walking gaits, especially those with extended flight phases, become increasingly efficient in low-gravity. Although the tests also showed that large contact forces lead to deep sinkage and ultimately increased the risk of falling. We introduce the quadruped robot SpaceBok and respective hardware modifications to perform efficient, repetitive, low-gravity jumping. To this end, we installed a reaction wheel that allows for stabilization during the extensive flight phase and parallel elasticities in the legs to increase energy efficiency. To tackle the sand-walking challenge, we developed novel passive-adaptive planar feet, which reduced sinkage and increase traction on highly compressible, dry granular media. Together with a terrain-adapting walking controller, we demonstrate the traversal of steep, representative Martian analog slopes. We evaluate the robot's performance in terms of safety and efficiency and propose effective strategies for overcoming slopes. Lastly, we present an approach to perform a tactile inspection of the terrain in front of the robot using one of the limbs. This inspection-before-traversal increases the certainty about the terrain type and thus the safety of the system. We spun off this approach to the terrestrial application of concrete inspection in sewers. Here, we performed semi-autonomous missions in a subterranean environment where a tactile inspection motion was carried out every few meters to assess the state of deterioration. The technology developments presented in this thesis have been thoroughly tested and validated on two advanced quadrupedal robots, namely ANYmal and SpaceBok.},

One of the biggest challenges is providing a data set of the vehicle's true motion, which has not been solved completely. This paper presents and evaluates a new method to identify the motion model parameters of a UUV. The method uses the UUV's pose estimation, the on-board cameras, fiducial markers and an adaptive method to combine the resulting data. The new method is used to parameterize the model of the FlatFish AUV.

This is typically done by classical hand-eye calibration, where a transformation is estimated by observing a known calibration object under different robot poses. The same holds for mobile bases as well, where the mounted cameras' poses with respect to the robot need to be known. However, there are cases where this robot/hand-eye calibration is not possible, for example because of limited movability or reduced precision of the robot. We want to present a new calibration method, which allows for a precise calibration also in these situations. This is achieved by rotating the robot around one axis and sampling a high number of visual features, in our case AprilTag markers. By fitting a Bingham distribution to the sampled markers around several configurations of the robot and determining the rotation center and axis, a mathematical model connecting the kinematics of the robot to the camera frame of reference can be found. We show that this method can be applied to cases where a classical hand-eye calibration fails, e.g. a robot base with limited movability. Our method allows an estimation of the camera to robot transformation even under those challenging conditions, e.g. where no part of the robot is visible from the camera.},

We have analyzed error propagation along two horizontal axes along with the effect of angular rotation about the vertical axis. We have identified that the angular rotation of the camera (yaw angle) about its vertical axis is the primary source of error that decreases the precision to the point where the marker system is not potentially viable for sub-decimeter precise tasks. Other factors are the distance and viewing angle of the camera from the AprilTag. Based on these observations, three improvement steps have been proposed. One is the trigonometric correction of the yaw angle to point the camera towards the center of the tag. Second, the use of a custom-built yaw-axis gimbal, which tracks the center of the tag in real-time. Third, we have presented for the first time a pose-indexed probabilistic sensor error model of the AprilTag using a Gaussian Processes based regression of experimental data, validated by particle filter tracking. Our proposed approach, which can be deployed with all three improvement steps, increases the system’s overall accuracy and precision by manifolds with a slight trade-off with execution time over commonly available AprilTag library. These proposed improvements make AprilTag suitable to be used as precision localization systems for outdoor and indoor applications.},

	abstract = {Fault-tolerant control is crucial for safety-critical systems, such as quadrotors. State-of-art flight controllers can stabilize and control a quadrotor even when subjected to the complete loss of a rotor. However, these methods rely on external sensors, such as GPS or motion capture systems, for state estimation. To the best of our knowledge, this has not yet been achieved with only onboard sensors. In this letter, we propose the first algorithm that combines fault-tolerant control and onboard vision-based state estimation to achieve position control of a quadrotor subjected to complete failure of one rotor. Experimental validations show that our approach is able to accurately control the position of a quadrotor during a motor failure scenario, without the aid of any external sensors. The primary challenge to vision-based state estimation stems from the inevitable high-speed yaw rotation (over 20 rd/s) of the damaged quadrotor, causing motion blur to cameras, which is detrimental to visual inertial odometry (VIO). We compare two types of visual inputs to the vision-based state estimation algorithm: standard frames and events. Experimental results show the advantage of using an event camera especially in low light environments due to its inherent high dynamic range and high temporal resolution. We believe that our approach will render autonomous quadrotors safer in both GPS denied or degraded environments. We release both our controller and VIO algorithm open source.

          , 
            Quadrotors are agile. Unlike most other machines, they can traverse extremely complex environments at high speeds. To date, only expert human pilots have been able to fully exploit their capabilities. Autonomous operation with onboard sensing and computation has been limited to low speeds. State-of-the-art methods generally separate the navigation problem into subtasks: sensing, mapping, and planning. Although this approach has proven successful at low speeds, the separation it builds upon can be problematic for high-speed navigation in cluttered environments. The subtasks are executed sequentially, leading to increased processing latency and a compounding of errors through the pipeline. Here, we propose an end-to-end approach that can autonomously fly quadrotors through complex natural and human-made environments at high speeds with purely onboard sensing and computation. The key principle is to directly map noisy sensory observations to collision-free trajectories in a receding-horizon fashion. This direct mapping drastically reduces processing latency and increases robustness to noisy and incomplete perception. The sensorimotor mapping is performed by a convolutional network that is trained exclusively in simulation via privileged learning: imitating an expert with access to privileged information. By simulating realistic sensor noise, our approach achieves zero-shot transfer from simulation to challenging real-world environments that were never experienced during training: dense forests, snow-covered terrain, derailed trains, and collapsed buildings. Our work demonstrates that end-to-end policies trained in simulation enable high-speed autonomous flight through challenging environments, outperforming traditional obstacle avoidance pipelines.},

	abstract = {Due to noisy actuation and external disturbances, tuning controllers for high-speed flight is very challenging. In this letter, we ask the following questions: How sensitive are controllers to tuning when tracking high-speed maneuvers? What algorithms can we use to automatically tune them? To answer the first question, we study the relationship between parameters and performance and find out that the faster the maneuver, the more sensitive a controller becomes to its parameters. To answer the second question, we review existing methods for controller tuning and discover that prior works often perform poorly on the task of high-speed flight. Therefore, we propose AutoTune, a sampling-based tuning algorithm specifically tailored to high-speed flight. In contrast to previous work, our algorithm does not assume any prior knowledge of the drone or its optimization function and can deal with the multi-modal characteristics of the parameters’ optimization space. We thoroughly evaluate AutoTune both in simulation and in the physical world. In our experiments, we outperform existing tuning algorithms by up to 90\% in trajectory completion. The resulting controllers are tested in the AirSim Game of Drones competition, where we outperform the winner by up to 25\% in lap-time. Finally, we validate AutoTune in real-world flights in one of the world’s largest motion-capture systems. In these experiments, we outperform human experts on the task of parameter tuning for trajectory tracking, achieving flight speeds over \$50 {\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}mathrmk{\textbackslash}mathrmm{\textbackslash}mathrmh{\textasciicircum}-1\$.},

In cluttered environments, small robots are desirable as they can maneuver through small gaps, narrow paths, or tunnels. However small robots have their own set of difficulties such as limited space for sensors, limited obstacle clearance, and scaled-down walking speed. In this paper, we extensively address these difficulties via effective sensor integration and exploitation of dynamic locomotion and jumping. We integrate two Intel RealSense sensors into the MIT Mini-Cheetah, a 0.3 m tall, 9 kg quadruped robot. Simple and effective filtering and evaluation algorithms are used for foothold adjustment and obstacle avoidance. We showcase the exploration of highly irregular terrain using dynamic trotting and jumping with the small-scale, fully sensorized Mini-Cheetah quadruped robot.},

Locomotion on discontinuous terrains, such as those with gaps or obstacles, presents a complementary set of challenges. In discontinuous settings, it becomes necessary to plan ahead using visual inputs and to execute agile behaviors beyond robust walking, such as jumps. Such dynamic motion results in significant motion of onboard sensors, which introduces a new set of challenges for real-time visual processing. The requirement for agility and terrain awareness in this setting reinforces the need for robust control. We present Depth-based Impulse Control (DIC), a method for synthesizing highly agile visually-guided locomotion behaviors. DIC affords the flexibility of model-free learning but regularizes behavior through explicit model-based optimization of ground reaction forces. We evaluate the proposed method both in simulation and in the real world.},

There are two main challenges for close proximity flights: (i) the trust characteristics varies drastically for the different distance from the ceiling which results in a complex nonlinear dynamics; (ii) the system needs to consider physical and environmental constraints to safely fly in close proximity. To address these challenges, a novel framework consisting of a constrained optimization-based force estimation and an optimization-based nonlinear controller is proposed. Experimental results illustrate that the performance of the proposed control approach can stabilize UAV down to 1 cm distance to the ceiling. Furthermore, we report that the UAV consumes up to 12.5\% less power when it is operated 1 cm distance to ceiling, which is promising potential for more battery-efficient inspection flights.},

Visual navigation based on AI approaches, such as deep neural networks (DNNs) are becoming pervasive for standard-size drones, but are considered out of reach for nano-drones with a size of a few cm2. In this paper, we present the first (to the best of our knowledge) demonstration of a navigation engine for autonomous nano-drones capable of closed-loop end-to-end DNN-based visual navigation. To achieve this goal we developed a complete methodology for parallel execution of complex DNNs directly on board resource-constrained milliwatt-scale nodes. Our system is based on GAP8, a novel parallel ultralow-power computing platform, and a 27-g commercial, open-source Crazyflie 2.0 nano-quadrotor. As part of our general methodology, we discuss the software mapping techniques that enable the DroNet state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network to be fully executed aboard within a strict 6 frame-per-second real-time constraint with no compromise in terms of flight results, while all processing is done with only 64 mW on average. Our navigation engine is flexible and can be used to span a wide performance range: at its peak performance corner, it achieves 18 frames/s while still consuming on average just 3.5\% of the power envelope of the deployed nano-aircraft. To share our key findings with the embedded and robotics communities and foster further developments in autonomous nano-unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), we publicly release all our code, datasets, and trained networks.},

	abstract = {Fluidic locomotion of flapping Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) can be very complex, particularly when the rules from insect flight dynamics (fast flapping dynamics and light wings) are not applicable. In these situations, widely used averaging techniques can fail quickly. The primary motivation is to find efficient models for complex forms of aerial locomotion where wings constitute a large part of body mass (i.e., dominant inertial effects) and deform in multiple directions (i.e., morphing wing). In these systems, high degrees of freedom yields complex inertial, Coriolis, and gravity terms. We use Algorithmic Differentiation (AD) and Bayesian filters computed with cubature rules conjointly to quickly estimate complex fluid-structure interactions. In general, Bayesian filters involve finding complex numerical integration (e.g., find posterior integrals). Using cubature rules to compute Gaussian-weighted integrals and AD, we show that the complex multi-degrees-of-freedom dynamics of morphing MAVs can be computed very efficiently and accurately. Therefore, our work facilitates closed-loop feedback control of these morphing MAVs.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a framework rooted in control and planning that enables quadrupedal robots to traverse challenging terrains with discrete footholds using visual feedback. Navigating discrete terrain is challenging for quadrupeds because the motion of the robot can be aperiodic, highly dynamic, and blind for the hind legs of the robot. Additionally, the robot needs to reason over both the feasible footholds as well as robot velocity by speeding up and slowing down at different parts of the terrain. We build an offline library of periodic gaits which span two trotting steps on the robot, and switch between different motion primitives to achieve aperiodic motions of different step lengths on an A1 robot. The motion library is used to provide targets to a geometric model predictive controller which controls stance. To incorporate visual feedback, we use terrain mapping tools to build a local height map of the terrain around the robot using RGB and depth cameras, and extract feasible foothold locations around both the front and hind legs of the robot. Our experiments show a Unitree A1 robot navigating multiple unknown, challenging and discrete terrains in the real world.},

Our approach assumes that the location and geometry of a large reference object are known, e.g., as a CAD model from Building Information Modeling (BIM) or a previously captured dense point cloud model. We do not expect the reference object to be present in every LiDAR scan. Our approach uses the poses of the LOAM algorithm as an initial guess to refine them with scan-to-model alignment. To evaluate if the alignment was accurate, an EKF-based motion prior filtering step is employed. Subsequently, the past trajectory is optimized by adding the model-aligned pose as a pose graph constraint and the map of the LOAM algorithm is corrected to improve future localization and mapping. We evaluate our approach with data captured in a visual airplane inspection scenario inside an aircraft hangar. A 3D LiDAR sensor is mounted via a gimbal on an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and is continuously actuated. We compare the localization accuracy of the LOAM and R-LOAM algorithms when enabling or disabling our proposed reference object-based trajectory and map optimization extension. For three recorded datasets, enabling the proposed extension yields a reduction in Absolute Pose Error compared to conventional LOAM and R-LOAM, while being able to run online. This reduces drift and improves map quality.},

	abstract = {Insects and hummingbirds not only can perform long-term stationary hovering but also are capable of acrobatic maneuvers. At their body scale, such extraordinary flight performance remains unmatched by state-of-the-art conventional man-made aerial vehicles with fixed or rotary wings. Insects' and hummingbirds' near maximal performance come from their highly intricate and powerful wing-thorax actuation systems, sophisticated sensory system, and precise neuromotor control. Flapping Wing Micro Air Vehicles (FWMAVs) with bio-inspired flapping flight mechanisms hold great promise in matching the performance gap of their natural counterparts. Developing such autonomous flapping-wing vehicles to achieve animal-like flight, however, is challenging. The difficulties are mainly from the high power density requirements under the stringent constraints of scale, weight, and power, severe system oscillations induced by high-frequency wing motion, high nonlinearity of the system, and lack of miniature navigation sensors, which impede actuation system design, onboard sensing, flight control, and autonomous navigation. To address these open issues, in this thesis, we first introduce systematic modeling of a dual-motor hummingbird-scale flapping wing robot. Based upon it, we then present studies of the onboard sensor fusion, flight control, and navigation method. By taking the key inspiration from its natural counterparts, the proposed hummingbird robot has a pair of independently controlled wings. Each wing is directly actuated by a dc motor. Motors undergo reciprocating motion. Such a design is a severely underactuated system, namely, it relies on only two actuators (one per wing) to control full six degrees of freedom body motion. As a bio-inspired design, it also requires the vehicle close to its natural counterparts’ size and weight meanwhile provide sufficient lift and control effort for autonomy. Due to stringent payload limitation from severe underactuation and power efficiency challenges caused by motor reciprocating motion, the design and integration of such a system is a challenging task. In this thesis, we present the detailed modeling, optimization, and system integration of onboard power, actuation, sensing, and flight control to address these unique challenges. As a result, we successfully prototyped such dual-motor powered hummingbird robot, either with power tethers or fully untethered. The tethered platform is used for designing onboard sensing, control, and navigation algorithms. Untethered design tackles system optimization and integration challenges. Both tethered/untethered versions demonstrate sustained stable flight. For onboard attitude sensing, a real-time sensor fusion algorithm is proposed with model-based adaptive compensation for both sensor reading drift and wing motion induced severe system vibration. With accurate and robust sensing results, a nonlinear robust control law is designed to stabilize the system during flight. Stable hovering and waypoint tracking flight were experimentally conducted to demonstrate the control performance. In order to achieve natural flyers' acrobatic maneuverability, we propose a hybrid control scheme by combining a model-based robust controller with a model-free reinforcement learning maneuver policy to perform aggressive maneuvers. The model-based control is responsible for stabilizing the robot in nominal flight scenarios. The reinforcement learning policy pushes the flight envelope to pilot fierce maneuvers. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed control method, we experimentally show animal-like tight flip maneuver on the proposed hummingbird robot, which is actuated by only two DC motors. These successful results show the promise of such a hybrid control design on severely underactuated systems to achieve high-performance flight.In order to navigate confined space while matching the design constraints of such a small robot, we propose to use its wings in dual functions - combining sensing and actuation in one element, which is inspired by animals' multifunctional flapping wings. Based on the interpretation of the motor current feedback which directly indicates wing load changes, the onboard somatosensory-like feedback has been achieved on our hummingbird robot. For navigation purposes, such a method can sense the presence of environmental changes, including grounds, walls, stairs, and obstacles, without the need for any other sensory cues. As long as the robot can fly, it can sense surroundings. To demonstrate this capability, three challenging tasks have been conducted onto the proposed hummingbird robot: terrain following, wall detection and bypass, and navigating a confined corridor. Finally, we integrate the proposed methods into the untethered platform, which enables stable untethered flight of such a design in both indoor and outdoor tests. To the best of our knowledge, this result presents the first bio-inspired FWMAV powered by only two actuators and capable of performing sustained stable flight in both indoor and outdoor environment. It is also the first untethered flight of an at-scale tailless hummingbird robot with independently controlled wings, a key inspiration from its natural counterparts.},

Such dual functions of sensing and actuation coupled in one element are particularly useful for small sized bio-inspired robotic flyers, whose weight, size, and power are under stringent constraint. In this work, we present the first flapping-wing robot using its flapping wings for environmental perception and navigation in tight space, without the need for any visual feedback. As the test platform, we introduce the Purdu Hummingbird, a flapping-wing robot with 17cm wingspan and 12 grams weight, with a pair of 30-40Hz flapping wings driven by only two actuators. By interpreting the wing loading feedback and its variations, the vehicle can detect the presence of environmental changes such as grounds, walls, stairs, obstacles and wind gust. The instantaneous wing loading can be obtained through the measurements and interpretation of the current feedback by the motors that actuate the wings. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is experimentally demonstrated on several challenging flight tasks without vision: terrain following, wall following and going through a narrow corridor. To ensure flight stability, a robust controller was designed for handling unforeseen disturbances during the flight. Sensing and navigating one's environment through actuator loading is a promising method for mobile robots, and it can serve as an alternative or complementary method to visual perception.},

In this article, we present the first FWMAV with onboard vision processing for autonomous flight in generic environments. In particular, we introduce the DelFly `Explorer', a 20-gram FWMAV equipped with a 0.98-gram autopilot and a 4.0-gram onboard stereo vision system. We explain the design choices that permit carrying the extended payload, while retaining the DelFly's hover capabilities. In addition, we introduce a novel stereo vision algorithm, LongSeq, designed specifically to cope with the flapping motion and the desire to attain a computational effort tuned to the frame rate. The onboard stereo vision system is illustrated in the context of an obstacle avoidance task in an environment with sparse obstacles.},

	abstract = {Autonomous exploration of subterranean environments remains a major challenge for robotic systems. In response, this paper contributes a novel graph-based subterranean exploration path planning method that is attuned to key topological properties of subterranean settings, such as large-scale tunnel-like networks and complex multibranched topologies. Designed both for aerial and legged robots, the proposed method is structured around a bifurcated local- and global-planner architecture. The local planner utilizes a rapidly exploring random graph to reliably and efficiently identify paths that optimize an exploration gain within a local subspace, while simultaneously avoiding obstacles, respecting applicable traversability constraints and honoring dynamic limitations of the robots. Reflecting the fact that multibranched and tunnel-like networks of underground environments can often lead to dead-ends and accounting for the robot endurance, the global planning layer works in conjunction with the local planner to incrementally build a sparse global graph and is engaged when the system must be repositioned to a previously identified frontier of the exploration space, or commanded to return-to-home. The designed planner is detailed with respect to its computational complexity and compared against state-of-the-art approaches. Emphasizing field experimentation, the method is evaluated within multiple real-life deployments using aerial robots and the ANYmal legged system inside both long-wall and room-and-pillar underground mines in the United States and in Switzerland, as well as inside an underground bunker. The presented results further include missions conducted within the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Subterranean Challenge, a relevant competition on underground exploration.},

Here we describe the solution developed by Team CSIRO Data61, consisting of CSIRO, Emesent and Georgia Tech, during the DARPA Subterranean Challenge. These presented systems were fielded in the Tunnel Circuit in August 2019, the Urban Circuit in February 2020, and in our own Cave event, conducted in September 2020. A unique capability of the fielded team is the homogeneous sensing of the platforms utilised, which is leveraged to obtain a decentralised multi-agent SLAM solution on each platform (both ground agents and UAVs) using peer-to-peer communications. This enabled a shift in focus from constructing a pervasive communications network to relying on multi-agent autonomy, motivated by experiences in early circuit events. These experiences also showed the surprising capability of rugged tracked platforms for challenging terrain, which in turn led to the heterogeneous team structure based on a BIA5 OzBot Titan ground robot and an Emesent Hovermap UAV, supplemented by smaller tracked or legged ground robots. The ground agents use a common CatPack perception module, which allowed reuse of the perception and autonomy stack across all ground agents with minimal adaptation.},

The presented machine was designed with a focus on outdoor suitability, simple maintenance, and user-friendly handling to enable future operation in real world scenarios. Performance tests with the joint actuators indicated a torque control bandwidth of more than 70 Hz, high disturbance rejection capability, as well as impact robustness when moving with maximal velocity. It is demonstrated in a series of experiments that ANYmal can execute walking gaits, dynamically trot at moderate speed, and is able to perform special maneuvers to stand up or crawl very steep stairs. Detailed measurements unveil that even full-speed running requires less than 280 W, resulting in an autonomy of more than 2 h.},

With the advent of smart devices, embedding cameras, inertial measurement units, visual SLAM (vSLAM), and visual-inertial SLAM (viSLAM) are enabling novel general public applications. In this context, this paper conducts a review of popular SLAM approaches with a focus on vSLAM/viSLAM, both at fundamental and experimental levels. It starts with a structured overview of existing vSLAM and viSLAM designs and continues with a new classification of a dozen main state-of-the-art methods. A chronological survey of viSLAM’s development highlights the historical milestones and presents more recent methods into a classification. Finally, the performance of vSLAM is experimentally assessed for the use case of pedestrian pose estimation with a handheld device in urban environments. The performance of five open-source methods Vins-Mono, ROVIO, ORB-SLAM2, DSO, and LSD-SLAM is compared using the EuRoC MAV dataset and a new visual-inertial dataset corresponding to urban pedestrian navigation. A detailed analysis of the computation results identifies the strengths and weaknesses for each method. Globally, ORB-SLAM2 appears to be the most promising algorithm to address the challenges of urban pedestrian navigation, tested with two datasets.},

We recorded a large set of image sequences from a Microsoft Kinect with highly accurate and time-synchronized ground truth camera poses from a motion capture system. The sequences contain both the color and depth images in full sensor resolution (640 × 480) at video frame rate (30 Hz). The ground-truth trajectory was obtained from a motion-capture system with eight high-speed tracking cameras (100 Hz). The dataset consists of 39 sequences that were recorded in an office environment and an industrial hall. The dataset covers a large variety of scenes and camera motions. We provide sequences for debugging with slow motions as well as longer trajectories with and without loop closures. Most sequences were recorded from a handheld Kinect with unconstrained 6-DOF motions but we also provide sequences from a Kinect mounted on a Pioneer 3 robot that was manually navigated through a cluttered indoor environment. To stimulate the comparison of different approaches, we provide automatic evaluation tools both for the evaluation of drift of visual odometry systems and the global pose error of SLAM systems. The benchmark website [1] contains all data, detailed descriptions of the scenes, specifications of the data formats, sample code, and evaluation tools.},

	abstract = {We present a complete solution for the visual navigation of a small-scale, low-cost quadrocopter in unknown environments. Our approach relies solely on a monocular camera as the main sensor, and therefore does not need external tracking aids such as GPS or visual markers. Costly computations are carried out on an external laptop that communicates over wireless LAN with the quadrocopter. Our approach consists of three components: a monocular SLAM system, an extended Kalman filter for data fusion, and a PID controller. In this paper, we (1) propose a simple, yet effective method to compensate for large delays in the control loop using an accurate model of the quadrocopter’s flight dynamics, and (2) present a novel, closed-form method to estimate the scale of a monocular SLAM system from additional metric sensors. We extensively evaluated our system in terms of pose estimation accuracy, flight accuracy, and flight agility using an external motion capture system. Furthermore, we compared the convergence and accuracy of our scale estimation method for an ultrasound altimeter and an air pressure sensor with filtering-based approaches. The complete system is available as open-source in ROS. This software can be used directly with a low-cost, off-the-shelf Parrot AR.Drone quadrocopter, and hence serves as an ideal basis for follow-up research projects.},

	abstract = {We present a complete solution for the visual navigation of a small-scale, low-cost quadrocopter in unknown environments. Our approach relies solely on a monocular camera as the main sensor, and therefore does not need external tracking aids such as GPS or visual markers. Costly computations are carried out on an external laptop that communicates over wireless LAN with the quadrocopter. Our approach consists of three components: a monocular SLAM system, an extended Kalman ﬁlter for data fusion, and a PID controller. In this paper, we (1) propose a simple, yet effective method to compensate for large delays in the control loop using an accurate model of the quadrocopter’s ﬂight dynamics, and (2) present a novel, closed-form method to estimate the scale of a monocular SLAM system from additional metric sensors. We extensively evaluated our system in terms of pose estimation accuracy, ﬂight accuracy, and ﬂight agility using an external motion capture system. Furthermore, we compared the convergence and accuracy of our scale estimation method for an ultrasound altimeter and an air pressure sensor with ﬁltering-based approaches. The complete system is available as open-source in ROS. This software can be used directly with a low-cost, off-the-shelf Parrot AR.Drone quadrocopter, and hence serves as an ideal basis for follow-up research projects.},

	abstract = {One of the main challenges of aerial robots navigation in indoor or GPS-denied environments is position estimation using only the available onboard sensors. This paper presents a Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) system that remotely calculates the pose and environment map of different low-cost commercial aerial platforms, whose onboard computing capacity is usually limited. The proposed system adapts to the sensory configuration of the aerial robot, by integrating different state-of-the art SLAM methods based on vision, laser and/or inertial measurements using an Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). To do this, a minimum onboard sensory configuration is supposed, consisting of a monocular camera, an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) and an altimeter. It allows to improve the results of well-known monocular visual SLAM methods (LSD-SLAM and ORB-SLAM are tested and compared in this work) by solving scale ambiguity and providing additional information to the EKF. When payload and computational capabilities permit, a 2D laser sensor can be easily incorporated to the SLAM system, obtaining a local 2.5D map and a footprint estimation of the robot position that improves the 6D pose estimation through the EKF. We present some experimental results with two different commercial platforms, and validate the system by applying it to their position control.},

	abstract = {In many drone applications, drones need the ability to fly fully or partially autonomously to carry out their mission. To enable such fully/partially autonomous flights, the ground control station that is supporting the drone’s operation needs to constantly localize and track the drone, and send this information to the drone’s navigation controller to enable autonomous/semiautonomous navigation. In outdoor environments, localization and tracking can be readily carried out using GPS and the drone’s Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs). However, in indoor areas or GPS-denied environments, such an approach is not feasible. In this paper, we propose a localization and tracking scheme for drones called ROLATIN (Robust Localization and Tracking for Indoor Navigation of drones) that was specifically devised for GPS-denied environments. Instead of GPS signals, ROLATIN relies on speakergenerated ultrasonic acoustic signals to estimate the target drone’s location and track its movement. Compared to vision and RF signal-based methods, our scheme offers a number of advantages in terms of performance and cost.},

The goals of this system include  taking measures of temperature, humidity, luminosity and CO2 concentration and plotting maps of these variables. These features could potentially allow for climate control, crop monitoring or failure detection (e.g., a break in a plastic cover). The sensors have been selected by considering the climate and plant growth models and the requirements for their integration onboard the quadrotor. The sensors layout and placement have been determined through a study of quadrotor aerodynamics and the influence of the airflows from its rotors. All components of the system have been developed, integrated and tested through a set of field experiments in a real greenhouse. The primary contributions of this paper are the validation of the quadrotor as a platform for measuring environmental variables and the determination of the optimal location of sensors on a quadrotor.},

	abstract = {Real-time data collection and decision making with drones will play an important role in precision livestock and farming. Drones are already being used in precision agriculture. Nevertheless, this is not the case for indoor livestock and farming environments due to several challenges and constraints. These indoor environments are limited in physical space and there is the localization problem, due to GPS unavailability. Therefore, this work aims to give a step toward the usage of drones for indoor farming and livestock management. To investigate on the drone positioning in these workspaces, two visual simultaneous localization and mapping (VSLAM)—LSD-SLAM and ORB-SLAM—algorithms were compared using a monocular camera onboard a small drone. Several experiments were carried out in a greenhouse and a dairy farm barn with the absolute trajectory and the relative pose error being analyzed. It was found that the approach that suits best these workspaces is ORB-SLAM. This algorithm was tested by performing waypoint navigation and generating maps from the clustered areas. It was shown that aerial VSLAM could be achieved within these workspaces and that plant and cattle monitoring could benefit from using affordable and off-the-shelf drone technology.},

	abstract = {Autonomous micro aerial vehicles (MAVs) have cost and mobility benefits, making them ideal robotic platforms for applications including aerial photography, surveillance, and search and rescue. As the platform scales down, MAVs become more capable of operating in confined environments, but it also introduces significant size and payload constraints. A monocular visual-inertial navigation system (VINS), consisting only of an inertial measurement unit (IMU) and a camera, becomes the most suitable sensor suite in this case, thanks to its light weight and small footprint. In fact, it is the minimum sensor suite allowing autonomous flight with sufficient environmental awareness. In this paper, we show that it is possible to achieve reliable online autonomous navigation using monocular VINS. Our system is built on a customized quadrotor testbed equipped with a fisheye camera, a low-cost IMU, and heterogeneous onboard computing resources. The backbone of our system is a highly accurate optimization-based monocular visual-inertial state estimator with online initialization and self-extrinsic calibration. An onboard GPU-based monocular dense mapping module that conditions on the estimated pose provides wide-angle situational awareness. Finally, an online trajectory planner that operates directly on the incrementally built three-dimensional map guarantees safe navigation through cluttered environments. Extensive experimental results are provided to validate individual system modules as well as the overall performance in both indoor and outdoor environments.},

	abstract = {Autonomous navigation of miniaturized robots (e.g., nano/pico aerial vehicles) is currently a grand challenge for robotics research, due to the need of processing a large amount of sensor data (e.g., camera frames) with limited on-board computational resources. In this paper we focus on the design of a visual-inertial odometry (VIO) system in which the robot estimates its ego-motion (and a landmark-based map) from on- board camera and IMU data. We argue that scaling down VIO to miniaturized platforms (without sacrificing performance) requires a paradigm shift in the design of perception algorithms, and we advocate a co-design approach in which algorithmic and hardware design choices are tightly coupled. Our contribution is four-fold. First, we discuss the VIO co-design problem, in which one tries to attain a desired resource-performance trade-off, by making suitable design choices (in terms of hardware, algorithms, implementation, and parameters). Second, we characterize the design space, by discussing how a relevant set of design choices affects the resource-performance trade-off in VIO. Third, we provide a systematic experiment-driven way to explore the design space, towards a design that meets the desired trade-off. Fourth, we demonstrate the result of the co-design process by providing a VIO implementation on specialized hardware and showing that such implementation has the same accuracy and speed of a desktop implementation, while requiring a fraction of the power.},

	abstract = {Flying robots require a combination of accuracy and low latency in their state estimation in order to achieve stable and robust flight. However, due to the power and payload constraints of aerial platforms, state estimation algorithms must provide these qualities under the computational constraints of embedded hardware. Cameras and inertial measurement units (IMUs) satisfy these power and payload constraints, so visual-inertial odometry (VIO) algorithms are popular choices for state estimation in these scenarios, in addition to their ability to operate without external localization from motion capture or global positioning systems. It is not clear from existing results in the literature, however, which VIO algorithms perform well under the accuracy, latency, and computational constraints of a flying robot with onboard state estimation. This paper evaluates an array of publicly-available VIO pipelines (MSCKF, OKVIS, ROVIO, VINS-Mono, SVO+MSF, and SVO+GTSAM) on different hardware configurations, including several single-board computer systems that are typically found on flying robots. The evaluation considers the pose estimation accuracy, per-frame processing time, and CPU and memory load while processing the EuRoC datasets, which contain six degree of freedom (6DoF) trajectories typical of flying robots. We present our complete results as a benchmark for the research community.},

	abstract = {Current approaches for visual-inertial odometry (VIO) are able to attain highly accurate state estimation via nonlinear optimization. However, real-time optimization quickly becomes infeasible as the trajectory grows over time; this problem is further emphasized by the fact that inertial measurements come at high rate, hence, leading to the fast growth of the number of variables in the optimization. In this paper, we address this issue by preintegrating inertial measurements between selected keyframes into single relative motion constraints. Our first contribution is a preintegration theory that properly addresses the manifold structure of the rotation group. We formally discuss the generative measurement model as well as the nature of the rotation noise and derive the expression for the maximum a posteriori state estimator. Our theoretical development enables the computation of all necessary Jacobians for the optimization and a posteriori bias correction in analytic form. The second contribution is to show that the preintegrated inertial measurement unit model can be seamlessly integrated into a visual-inertial pipeline under the unifying framework of factor graphs. This enables the application of incremental-smoothing algorithms and the use of a structureless model for visual measurements, which avoids optimizing over the 3-D points, further accelerating the computation. We perform an extensive evaluation of our monocular VIO pipeline on real and simulated datasets. The results confirm that our modeling effort leads to an accurate state estimation in real time, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches.},
