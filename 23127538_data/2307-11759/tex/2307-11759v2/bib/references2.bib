	abstract = {Similar to real snakes in nature, the flexible trunks of snake-like robots enhance their movement capabilities and adaptabilities in diverse environments. However, this flexibility corresponds to a complex control task involving highly redundant degrees of freedom, where traditional modelbased methods usually fail to propel the robots energy-efficiently and adaptively to unforeseeable joint damage. In this work, we present an approach for designing an energy-efficient and damagerecovery slithering gait for a snake-like robot using the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm and the inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) algorithm. Specifically, we first present an RL-based controller for generating locomotion gaits at a wide range of velocities, which is trained using the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm. Then, by taking the RL-based controller as an expert and collecting trajectories from it, we train an IRL-based controller using the adversarial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL) algorithm. For the purpose of comparison, a traditional parameterized gait controller is presented as the baseline and the parameter sets are optimized using the grid search and Bayesian optimization algorithm. Based on the analysis of the simulation results, we first demonstrate that this RL-based controller exhibits very natural and adaptive movements, which are also substantially more energy-efficient than the gaits generated by the parameterized controller. We then demonstrate that the IRL-based controller cannot only exhibit similar performances as the RL-based controller, but can also recover from the unpredictable damage body joints and still outperform the model-based controller, which has an undamaged body, in terms of energy efficiency.

	abstract = {In the present paper, a dynamic analysis is presented, comparing three snake-like robot gaits: lateral undulation, sidewinding locomotion, and sinus-lifting motion. To simplify calculations, sidewinding locomotion and sinus-lifting motion are considered planar movements. Vertical movements are assumed to be small but play a critical role in change where contacts are made. Thus, the normal forces acting on grounded links and the torques applied to pitch joints can be calculated by solving equilibrium equations. The tradeoff between locomotion speed and energy efficiency is studied for all three gaits, at eight different environmental settings distinguished by friction coefficients. Simulation results reveal that sinus-lifting motion and sidewinding locomotion are generally more energy-efficient gaits than is lateral undulation. More specifically, if the anisotropy in friction is large enough, sinus-lifting motion is the most energy-efficient gait; otherwise, sidewinding locomotion is more efficient. However, there are some critical speeds at which the most efficient gait changes, in some environmental settings.},

Serpentine gait is recognized as the most efficient gait for snakes in terms of energy, motor torques and friction forces. However, the conventional serpentine model is based on fixed parameters. Changing parameters to reach an optimal motion or avoid bumping to obstacles causes the robot parts slip. Using serpenoid curve is therefore no longer optimal due to the side slipping; the modified serpenoid equations presented here develops a serpenoid curve with variable parameters such that the motion remains optimal even when the parameters are changed. The results of simulations conducted here, representing motor torques and friction forces, show the efficiency of applying this method to a real robot.},

	doi = {10.1109/IROS.2018.8593722},
	abstract = {Bipedal locomotion skills are challenging to develop. Control strategies often use local linearization of the dynamics in conjunction with reduced-order abstractions to yield tractable solutions. In these model-based control strategies, the controller is often not fully aware of many details, including torque limits, joint limits, and other non-linearities that are necessarily excluded from the control computations for simplicity. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers a promising model-free approach for controlling bipedal locomotion which can more fully exploit the dynamics. However, current results in the machine learning literature are often based on ad-hoc simulation models that are not based on corresponding hardware. Thus it remains unclear how well DRL will succeed on realizable bipedal robots. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DRL using a realistic model of Cassie, a bipedal robot. By formulating a feedback control problem as finding the optimal policy for a Markov Decision Process, we are able to learn robust walking controllers that imitate a reference motion with DRL. Controllers for different walking speeds are learned by imitating simple time-scaled versions of the original reference motion. Controller robustness is demonstrated through several challenging tests, including sensory delay, walking blindly on irregular terrain and unexpected pushes at the pelvis. We also show we can interpolate between individual policies and that robustness can be improved with an interpolated policy.},

We use an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to estimate the gait parameters that best represent the robot's shape, and then choose a control space of parameters relative to that state. Because this controller specifies whole-body motions of the robot, we are able to generate compliant behavior, even though the joints of the robot contain stiff gear ratios with no mechanical compliance or torque sensing.},

Estimating world motion of snake robots is often difficult because of the complex way a robot's cyclic shape changes (gaits) interact with the surrounding environment. By using the virtual chassis to separate the robot's internal shape changes from its external motions through the world, we are able to construct a motion model based on the differential motion of the robot's modules between time steps. In this way, we effectively treat the snake robot like a wheeled robot where the bottom-most modules propel the robot in much the way the bottom of the wheels would propel the chassis of a car. Experimental results using a 16-DOF snake robot are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of this method for a variety of gaits that have been designed to traverse flat ground.},

Instead of starting from a pre-defined movement pattern such as a serpenoid curve, we use a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach to automatically generate effective locomotion gaits via trajectory optimization. An important advantage of this approach is that the resulting gaits are automatically adapted to the environment that is being modeled as part of the snake dynamics. To illustrate this, we use a novel model for anisotropic dry friction, along with existing models for viscous friction and fluid dynamic effects such as drag and added mass. For each of these models, gaits generated without any change in the method or its parameters are as efficient as Pareto-optimal serpenoid gaits tuned individually for each environment. Furthermore, the proposed method can also produce more complex or irregular gaits, e.g. for obstacle avoidance or executing sharp turns.},

	abstract = {Sidewinding is an efficient translational gait used by biological snakes to locomote over flat ground. Prior work has identified the fact that it is possible to steer the moving direction of sidewinding. The previously proposed virtual tread model reveals the working principal of sidewinding from a geometric point of view. Unfortunately, the implementation of the virtual tread model relied on a computationally expensive numerical fitting algorithm that impeded online applications. Motivated by this limitation, in this work we propose a novel approach to develop analytical expressions for snake robot gaits based on the study of the corresponding geometric model. This approach is rooted in the identification of dominant frequency components afforded by the two-dimensional Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT). Applying this method to the virtual tread model for conical sidewinding, we derive an analytical expression between the parameters that describe the gait's motion and the turning radius of the system moving in the world. This analytical expression, which we call the extended gait equation, is verified by experimental results.},

	abstract = {This article presents a method of producing gaits by using control mechanisms analogous to windup toys. The synthesis technique is based on optimization. One of the primary characteristics of "virtual windup toys" is that they are oblivious to their environment. This means that these creatures or simulated toys have no active control over balance. Nevertheless, "blind" parameterized control mechanisms can produce many common periodic gaits as well as aperiodic motions such as turns and leaps. The possibilities and limitations of this technique are presented in the context of example creatures having one, two, four, and six legs. An important attribute of the proposed synthesis method is that the motions produced can be parameterized. Thus, you can synthesize a family of motions instead of just a single fixed instance of a motion. The examples used here are: a hopping gait parameterized with respect to speed; a turning walk parameterized with respect to the turning rate, and a leap parameterized with respect to the size of the leap. The animator can thus interactively specify the hopping speed, turning rate, and leap size, respectively, for these physics-based motions.},

We show recursive feasibility of the MPC optimization problem, where some of the developed techniques are also applicable for the analysis of a more general class of system. Besides, we provide performance results and illustrate the achieved performance by numerical simulations. We thereby show that the economic MPC algorithm outperforms a standard lateral undulation controller and achieves constraint satisfaction.

Different gait generation methods produce completely different forms of control functions, so snake robots need more complicated programming logic and processes to realize various gaits and their transformation. Therefore, we propose a new unified expression of gait method, The MCC (main characteristics control) method simplifies and unifies the control functions of different snake robots gaits by extracting the main features of the backbone curves of snake robots gaits. Since all periodic curves that meet the Dirichlet conditions can be formed by superposition of sinusoidal curves, taking the “lowest frequency” part that reflects the main characteristics of the curve as the target configuration can simplify the motion control function of snake robots’ gaits. Based on the MCC method, some snake robot gaits are reconstructed, including serpentine gait, rolling gait, helix rolling gait, and crawler gait. In addition, based on MCC method, an AEH-sidewinding gait control method is proposed. The backbone of the AEH-sidewinding gait is closer to the ideal elliptic helix, thus improving the accuracy of its kinematics modeling of snake robot sidewinding gait. Finally, the validity of this gait is verified by experiments. This unified gait expression of snake robots will be helpful to realize smooth gait switching between different gaits of snake robots.},

	abstract = {A real snake has simple figure like a string, and has highly adaptability corresponding to the environments/tasks. A snake-like robot mimics such highly adaptability of the real snake, is expected as an adaptable robot corresponding to the environments/tasks. Many literatures have reported with respect to locomotion controls of the snake-like robot, but haven't reported studies for applications. However, enhancement of the applications is required in real scenes of which the snake-like robot is expected to work. This paper reports to design the force controller to realize the cutting task by the snake-like robot, as a leading example of the force control in the real scenes. Since the force control in the feed direction and the servo control in its normal direction are required in order to realize the cutting task, the Dynamic Hybrid Position/Force Control System is designed. The Virtual Internal Model based on the impedance model is utilized as the force control method. The Model Following Servo Control System utilizing the Virtual Internal Model based on the impedance model is designed, and the Dynamic Hybrid Position/Force Control System is realized. Effectiveness of the designed control system is verified through a numerical simulation.},

Tree-based planning methods have enjoyed huge success in challenging domains, such as chess and Go, where a perfect simulator is available. However, in real-world problems the dynamics governing the environment are often complex and unknown. In this work we present the MuZero algorithm which, by combining a tree-based search with a learned model, achieves superhuman performance in a range of challenging and visually complex domains, without any knowledge of their underlying dynamics. MuZero learns a model that, when applied iteratively, predicts the quantities most directly relevant to planning: the reward, the action-selection policy, and the value function. When evaluated on 57 different Atari games - the canonical video game environment for testing AI techniques, in which model-based planning approaches have historically struggled - our new algorithm achieved a new state of the art. When evaluated on Go, chess and shogi, without any knowledge of the game rules, MuZero matched the superhuman performance of the AlphaZero algorithm that was supplied with the game rules.},

We introduce a stochastic variational inference and learning algorithm that scales to large datasets and, under some mild differentiability conditions, even works in the intractable case. Our contributions is two-fold. First, we show that a reparameterization of the variational lower bound yields a lower bound estimator that can be straightforwardly optimized using standard stochastic gradient methods. Second, we show that for i.i.d. datasets with continuous latent variables per datapoint, posterior inference can be made especially efﬁcient by ﬁtting an approximate inference model (also called a recognition model) to the intractable posterior using the proposed lower bound estimator.

	abstract = {Learning useful representations without supervision remains a key challenge in machine learning. In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful generative model that learns such discrete representations. Our model, the Vector QuantisedVariational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE), differs from VAEs in two key ways: the encoder network outputs discrete, rather than continuous, codes; and the prior is learnt rather than static. In order to learn a discrete latent representation, we incorporate ideas from vector quantisation (VQ). Using the VQ method allows the model to circumvent issues of “posterior collapse” -— where the latents are ignored when they are paired with a powerful autoregressive decoder -— typically observed in the VAE framework. Pairing these representations with an autoregressive prior, the model can generate high quality images, videos, and speech as well as doing high quality speaker conversion and unsupervised learning of phonemes, providing further evidence of the utility of the learnt representations.},

Second, these features are also excellent k-NN classifiers, reaching 78.3\% top-1 on ImageNet with a small ViT. Our study also underlines the importance of momentum encoder, multi-crop training, and the use of small patches with ViTs. We implement our findings into a simple self-supervised method, called DINO, which we interpret as a form of self-distillation with no labels. We show the synergy between DINO and ViTs by achieving 80.1\% top-1 on ImageNet in linear evaluation with ViT-Base.},

The two modules are interconnected into a closed-loop system: The RL module, analogizing the locomotion region located in the midbrain of vertebrate animals, regulates the input to the CPG system given state feedback from the robot. The output of the CPG system is then translated into pressure inputs to pneumatic actuators of the soft snake robot. Based on the fact that the oscillation frequency and wave amplitude of the Matsuoka oscillator can be independently controlled under different time scales, we further adapt the option-critic framework to improve the learning performance measured by optimality and data efﬁciency.

This approach also allows the use of DRL to explore questions related to neuroscience, namely the role of descending pathways, interoscillator couplings, and sensory feedback in gait generation. We train our policies in simulation and perform a sim-to-real transfer to the Unitree A1 quadruped, where we observe robust behavior to disturbances unseen during training, most notably to a dynamically added 13.75 kg load representing 115\% of the nominal quadruped mass. We test several different observation spaces based on proprioceptive sensing and show that our framework is deployable with no domain randomization and very little feedback, where along with the oscillator states, it is possible to provide only contact booleans in the observation space.},

	abstract = {Animal’s rhythmic movements such as locomotion are considered to be controlled by neural circuits called central pattern generators (CPGs). This article presents a reinforcement learning (RL) method for a CPG controller, which is inspired by the control mechanism of animals. Because the CPG controller is an instance of recurrent neural networks, a naive application of RL involves difﬁculties. In addition, since state and action spaces of controlled systems are very large in real problems such as robot control, the learning of the value function is also difﬁcult. In this study, we propose a learning scheme for a CPG controller called a CPGactor-critic model, whose learning algorithm is based on a policy gradient method. We apply our RL method to autonomous acquisition of biped locomotion by a biped robot simulator. Computer simulations show our method is able to train a CPG controller such that the learning process is stable.},

	abstract = {Central Pattern Generators (CPGs) have several properties desirable for locomotion: they generate smooth trajectories, are robust to perturbations and are simple to implement. Although conceptually promising, we argue that the full potential of CPGs has so far been limited by insufficient sensory-feedback information. This paper proposes a new methodology that allows tuning CPG controllers through gradient-based optimization in a Reinforcement Learning (RL) setting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time CPGs have been trained in conjunction with a MultilayerPerceptron (MLP) network in a Deep-RL context. In particular, we show how CPGs can directly be integrated as the Actor in an Actor-Critic formulation. Additionally, we demonstrate how this change permits us to integrate highly non-linear feedback directly from sensory perception to reshape the oscillators' dynamics. Our results on a locomotion task using a single-leg hopper demonstrate that explicitly using the CPG as the Actor rather than as part of the environment results in a significant increase in the reward gained over time (6x more) compared with previous approaches. Furthermore, we show that our method without feedback reproduces results similar to prior work with feedback. Finally, we demonstrate how our closed-loop CPG progressively improves the hopping behaviour for longer training epochs relying only on basic reward functions.},

Thus, we apply deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithm of reinforcement learning (RL) to tune the model and obtain optimal parameters. Consequently, the hyper-redundant snake robot performs graceful serpentine locomotion with an RL controller in simulation.

One promising model-free approach for soft robot control is reinforcement learning (RL). However, model-free RL methods tend to be computationally expensive and data-inefficient and may not yield natural and smooth locomotion patterns for soft robots. In this work, we develop a bioinspired design of a learning-based goal-tracking controller for a soft snake robot. The controller is composed of two modules: An RL module for learning goal-tracking behaviors given the unmodeled and stochastic dynamics of the robot, and a central pattern generator (CPG) with the Matsuoka oscillators for generating stable and diverse locomotion patterns. We theoretically investigate the maneuverability of Matsuoka CPG's oscillation bias, frequency, and amplitude for steering control, velocity control, and sim-to-real adaptation of the soft snake robot. Based on this analysis, we proposed a composition of RL and CPG modules such that the RL module regulates the tonic inputs to the CPG system given state feedback from the robot, and the output of the CPG module is then transformed into pressure inputs to pneumatic actuators of the soft snake robot. This design allows the RL agent to naturally learn to entrain the desired locomotion patterns determined by the CPG maneuverability. We validated the optimality and robustness of the control design in both simulation and real experiments, and performed extensive comparisons with state-of-art RL methods to demonstrate the benefit of our bioinspired control design.},

Having compared with the sustained-type neuron and the mutual inhibitory CPG, the cyclic inhibitory CPG was proven to generate capably rhythmic output with the least number of differential equations. In this paper, we introduce the neuron network organized by the cyclic inhibitory CPGs connected in line with unilateral excitation to control the 3D locomotion of a snake-like robot, and present the necessary condition for the CPG neuron network to sustain a rhythmic output. By implementing this control architecture to a simulator with consideration of mechanical dynamics of a real snake-like robot "Perambulator", preliminary parameter setting of the CPG neuron network for its 3D locomotion is obtained. Moreover, it is shown that "Perambulator" can successfully exhibit 3D locomotion by using the output of the proposed CPG network.

	abstract = {Legged robots that can operate autonomously in remote and hazardous environments will greatly increase opportunities for exploration into under-explored areas. Exteroceptive perception is crucial for fast and energy-efficient locomotion: perceiving the terrain before making contact with it enables planning and adaptation of the gait ahead of time to maintain speed and stability. However, utilizing exteroceptive perception robustly for locomotion has remained a grand challenge in robotics. Snow, vegetation, and water visually appear as obstacles on which the robot cannot step{\textasciitilde}-- or are missing altogether due to high reflectance. Additionally, depth perception can degrade due to difficult lighting, dust, fog, reflective or transparent surfaces, sensor occlusion, and more. For this reason, the most robust and general solutions to legged locomotion to date rely solely on proprioception. This severely limits locomotion speed, because the robot has to physically feel out the terrain before adapting its gait accordingly. Here we present a robust and general solution to integrating exteroceptive and proprioceptive perception for legged locomotion. We leverage an attention-based recurrent encoder that integrates proprioceptive and exteroceptive input. The encoder is trained end-to-end and learns to seamlessly combine the different perception modalities without resorting to heuristics. The result is a legged locomotion controller with high robustness and speed. The controller was tested in a variety of challenging natural and urban environments over multiple seasons and completed an hour-long hike in the Alps in the time recommended for human hikers.},

	abstract = {Model-free deep reinforcement learning algorithms have been shown to be capable of learning a wide range of robotic skills, but typically require a very large number of samples to achieve good performance. Model-based algorithms, in principle, can provide for much more efficient learning, but have proven difficult to extend to expressive, high-capacity models such as deep neural networks. In this work, we demonstrate that medium-sized neural network models can in fact be combined with model predictive control (MPC) to achieve excellent sample complexity in a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, producing stable and plausible gaits to accomplish various complex locomotion tasks. We also propose using deep neural network dynamics models to initialize a model-free learner, in order to combine the sample efficiency of model-based approaches with the high task-specific performance of model-free methods. We empirically demonstrate on MuJoCo locomotion tasks that our pure model-based approach trained on just random action data can follow arbitrary trajectories with excellent sample efficiency, and that our hybrid algorithm can accelerate model-free learning on high-speed benchmark tasks, achieving sample efficiency gains of 3-5x on swimmer, cheetah, hopper, and ant agents.

Especially when it comes to slippery ground conditions, common state estimation and control algorithms suffer from the usual noslip assumption. In fact, there has been only little research on this subject. This paper addresses the problem of slipping by treating slip detection and recovery tasks separately. Our contribution to the former is a probabilistic slip estimator based on a Hidden Markov Model. In the second part of this paper, we propose impedance control and friction modulation as useful tools to recover stability during traction loss.

Legged locomotion can dramatically expand the operational domains of robotics. However, conventional controllers for legged locomotion are based on elaborate state machines that explicitly trigger the execution of motion primitives and reflexes. These designs have escalated in complexity while falling short of the generality and robustness of animal locomotion. Here we present a radically robust controller for legged locomotion in challenging natural environments. We present a novel solution to incorporating proprioceptive feedback in locomotion control and demonstrate remarkable zero-shot generalization from simulation to natural environments. The controller is trained by reinforcement learning in simulation. It is based on a neural network that acts on a stream of proprioceptive signals. The trained controller has taken two generations of quadrupedal ANYmal robots to a variety of natural environments that are beyond the reach of prior published work in legged locomotion. The controller retains its robustness under conditions that have never been encountered during training: deformable terrain such as mud and snow, dynamic footholds such as rubble, and overground impediments such as thick vegetation and gushing water. The presented work opens new frontiers for robotics and indicates that radical robustness in natural environments can be achieved by training in much simpler domains.},

	abstract = {Snake-like robots have attracted attention as robots that can travel over rough terrain where wheeled mobility mechanisms cannot. Previous research on snake-like robots has mainly focused on the biological movement of snakes; therefore, the issue of power consumption caused by driving a large number of actuators still remains unaddressed. In this study, we propose an efficient movement method using the movement of the center of gravity (COG) as a solution to the above-mentioned problem. In the proposed method, the snake-like robot is first transformed into a wheel shape, and then, some motors of the joint are moved to shift the COG and rotate the robot. Therefore, good movement efficiency can be achieved on leveled terrain by the rolling movement, and a snake-like undulating drive with high running performance can be selected on underwater and rough terrain. To realize the proposed movement method, we propose a method for switching between the rotational movement and undulation drive modes. However, the rolling motion with a COG shift needs a design of an appropriate orbit of the eccentric COG and timing of the motion stage transition. In this study, we demonstrate the rolling motion design with a simplified equation of motion. Next, experiments are conducted to verify the traveling efficiency in the proposed rolling mode, and it is proven that the method can achieve twice the traveling efficiency of the undulating motion.},

The complex dynamics of soft tissue as an unstructured environment is one of the main challenges in any attempt to automate the manipulation of it via a surgical robotic system. Two AI learning based model predictive control algorithms using vision strategies are proposed and studied: (1) reinforcement learning and (2) learning from demonstration. Comparison of the performance of these AI algorithms in a simulation setting indicated that the learning from demonstration algorithm can boost the learning policy by initializing the predicted dynamics with given demonstrations. Furthermore, the learning from demonstration algorithm is implemented on a Raven IV surgical robotic system and successfully demonstrated feasibility of the proposed algorithm using an experimental approach. This study is part of a profound vision in which the role of a surgeon will be redefined as a pure decision maker whereas the vast majority of the manipulation will be conducted autonomously by a surgical robotic system.

While the potential of RL is now well established, many critical aspects still need to be tackled, including safety and stability issues. These issues, while secondary for the RL community, are central to the control community that has been widely investigating them. Model predictive control (MPC) is one of the most successful control techniques because, among others, of its ability to provide such guarantees even for uncertain constrained systems. Since MPC is an optimization-based technique, optimality has also often been claimed. Unfortunately, the performance of MPC is highly dependent on the accuracy of the model used for predictions.

	abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of gait transitions, acyclic feedforward motion patterns that allow a robot to switch from one gait to another. Legged robots often utilize collections of gait patterns to locomote over a variety of surfaces. Each feedforward gait is generally tuned for a specific surface and set of operating conditions. To enable locomotion across a changing surface, a robot must be able to stably change between gaits while continuing to locomote. By understanding the fundamentals of gaits, we present methods to correctly transition between differing gaits. On two separate robotic platforms, we show how the application of gait transitions enhances each robot's behavioral suite. Using the RHex robotic hexapod, gait transitions are used to smoothly switch from a tripod walking gait to a metachronal wave gait used to climb stairs. We also introduce the RiSE platform, a hexapod robot capable of vertical climbing, and discuss how gait transitions play an important role in achieving vertical mobility},

	abstract = {Recent breakthroughs both in reinforcement learning and trajectory optimization have made significant advances towards real world robotic system deployment. Reinforcement learning (RL) can be applied to many problems without needing any modeling or intuition about the system, at the cost of high sample complexity and the inability to prove any metrics about the learned policies. Trajectory optimization (TO) on the other hand allows for stability and robustness analyses on generated motions and trajectories, but is only as good as the often over-simplified derived model, and may have prohibitively expensive computation times for real-time control, for example in contact rich environments. This paper seeks to combine the benefits from these two areas while mitigating their drawbacks by (1) decreasing RL sample complexity by using existing knowledge of the problem with real-time optimal control, and (2) allowing online policy deployment at any point in the training process by using the TO (MPC) as a baseline or worst-case scenario action, while continuously improving the combined learned-optimized policy with deep RL. This method is evaluated on tasks of successively navigating a car model to a series of goal destinations over slippery terrains as fast as possible, in which drifting will allow the system to more quickly change directions while maintaining high speeds.},

	abstract = {Inspired by the efficient method of locomotion of the rattlesnake Crotalus cerastes, the objective of this work is automatic design through genetic programming (GP) of the fastest possible (sidewinding) locomotion of simulated limbless, wheelless snake-like robot (Snakebot). The realism of simulation is ensured by employing the Open Dynamics Engine (ODE), which facilitates implementation of all physical forces, resulting from the actuators, joints constrains, frictions, gravity, and collisions. Reduction of the search space of the GP is achieved by representation of Snakebot as a system comprising identical morphological segments and by automatic definition of code fragments, shared among (and expressing the correlation between) the evolved dynamics of the vertical and horizontal turning angles of the actuators of Snakebot. Empirically obtained results demonstrate the emergence of sidewinding locomotion from relatively simple motion patterns of morphological segments. Robustness of the sidewinding Snakebot, which is considered to be the ability to retain its velocity when situated in an unanticipated environment, is illustrated by the ease with which Snakebot overcomes various types of obstacles such as a pile of or burial under boxes, rugged terrain, and small walls. The ability of Snakebot to adapt to partial damage by gradually improving its velocity characteristics is discussed. Discovering compensatory locomotion traits, Snakebot recovers completely from single damage and recovers a major extent of its original velocity when more significant damage is inflicted. Exploring the opportunity for automatic design and adaptation of a simulated artifact, this work could be considered as a step toward building real Snakebots, which are able to perform robustly in difficult environments.},

	abstract = {Snake-like robots with 3D locomotion ability have significant advantages of adaptive travelling in diverse complex terrain over traditional legged or wheeled mobile robots. Despite numerous developed gaits, these snake-like robots suffer from unsmooth gait transitions by changing the locomotion speed, direction, and body shape, which would potentially cause undesired movement and abnormal torque. Hence, there exists a knowledge gap for snake-like robots to achieve autonomous locomotion. To address this problem, this paper presents the smooth slithering gait transition control based on a lightweight central pattern generator (CPG) model for snake-like robots. First, based on the convergence behavior of the gradient system, a lightweight CPG model with fast computing time was designed and compared with other widely adopted CPG models. Then, by reshaping the body into a more stable geometry, the slithering gait was modified, and studied based on the proposed CPG model, including the gait transition of locomotion speed, moving direction, and body shape. In contrast to sinusoid-based method, extensive simulations and prototype experiments finally demonstrated that smooth slithering gait transition can be effectively achieved using the proposed CPG-based control method without generating undesired locomotion and abnormal torque.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a biomimetic approach based on central pattern generator (CPG), to control turning motion of a snake-like robot. One of the interesting features of a biological snake is its ability to avoid obstacles or a barrier by turning its whole body from its trajectory. This special obstacle avoidance motion is different from other types of animal, and thus, it is worth to be analyzed and realized into a snake-like robot. The paper first briefly explains: 1) the phase oscillator model which represents the CPG model and 2) the CPG network. Next, we address several issues related to the existing/typical turning control of a snake-like robot. We then propose the phase transition method utilizing the phase difference control parameter to realize the turning motion of a snake-like robot. We also introduce a new parameter to control the turning of the robot, where it provides a way to incorporate sensory feedback into the CPG model. Simulation results show that the proposed turning method can be used efficiently as an obstacle avoidance method for a snake-like robot.},

According to the CPG mechanism, a hierarchical CCPG model (HCCPG) with small complexity is proposed to implement the three-dimensional gaits better. The HCCPG has a two-layers structure, namely the basic rhythmic signal generation layer and the output signal modulation layer. The HCCPG can generate three-dimensional gaits well and is extendable. Based on the HCCPG, a three-dimensional gait control method is proposed. The simulations and experiments validate this method.},

Then a MPC scheme is proposed by combining the two cost functions, to achieve better path following control performance and higher forward velocity of the snake robot.

Thus, we exclude joint angles using the averaging method to construct a simpler model. Another feature of the proposed model is that it can be derived from the original complex model without parameter identification using simulation data and without assuming straight-line movements. In addition to inequality constraints on joint angles and the frequency of joint motions, we impose constraints on the change rates of these variables in our MPC design since the averaged model is derived by assuming that these variables slowly change. Furthermore, we introduce a soft constraint to decrease the effects of approximation error of the simplified model on the control performance.

Despite many demonstrated successes of snake robots, these mechanisms have not been able to achieve the agility displayed by their biological counterparts. We suggest that studying how biological snakes coordinate whole-body motion to achieve agile behaviors can help improve the performance of snake robots. The foundation of this work is based on the hypothesis that, for snake locomotion that is approximately kinematic, replaying parameterized shape trajectory data collected from biological snakes can generate equivalent motions in snake robots. To test this hypothesis, we collected shape trajectory data from sidewinder rattlesnakes executing a variety of different behaviors. We then analyze the shape trajectory data in a concise and meaningful way by using a new algorithm, called conditioned basis array factorization, which projects high-dimensional data arrays onto a low-dimensional representation. The low-dimensional representation of the recorded snake motion is able to reproduce the essential features of the recorded biological snake motion on a snake robot, leading to improved agility and maneuverability, confirming our hypothesis. This parameterized representation allows us to search the low-dimensional parameter space to generate behaviors that further improve the performance of snake robots.},

This article addresses this problem for the locomotion of an amphibious snake robot, and aims at identifying fast swimming and crawling gaits for a variety of environments. Our approach uses a locomotion controller based on the biological concept of central pattern generators (CPGs) together with a gradient-free optimization method, Powell's method. A key aspect of our approach is that the gaits are optimized online, i.e., while moving, rather than as an off-line optimization process. We present various experiments with the real robot and in simulation: swimming, crawling on horizontal ground, and crawling on slopes. For each of these different situations, the optimized gaits are compared with the results of systematic explorations of the parameter space. The main outcomes of the experiments are: 1) optimal gaits are significantly different from one medium to the other; 2) the optimums are usually peaked, i.e., speed rapidly becomes suboptimal when the parameters are moved away from the optimal values; 3) our approach finds optimal gaits in much fewer iterations than the systematic search; and 4) the CPG has no problem dealing with the abrupt parameter changes during the optimization process. The relevance for robotic locomotion control is discussed.},

In the scheme, two corrective actions are conducted, namely adaptive compensation and feedback correction. The former adopts a cerebellar model articulation controller (C- MAC) to compute the inverse dynamics of the robot via online learning and the latter employs a proportional-derivative (PD) controller to provide correction terms to the desired motion. By virtue of the universal nonlinear approximation ability and the rapid learning response rate, the proposed CMAC is able to compensate the model uncertainties and thus enhance the adaptability of the control system. Moreover, the PD controller is utilized to expedite the converge speed through a regular feedback mechanism. In the end of paper, simulation studies in different friction cases are offered to validate the effectiveness of the proposed motion control approach.},

A synchronized line-of-sight (SLOS) guidance rule and a high-coupled dynamic frequency compensator are designed to revise the movement speed of each robot, ensuring position consistency among formation members. The equivalent principle of the barrier function restricts the state errors within a set range, eliminating the singularity of virtual variables and enhancing the steady-state performance of path-following. Moreover, this work predicts the model uncertainty and external disturbances to pre-compensate for the joint offset and torque input of the robot. The method further improves the convergence rates and robustness of the following errors. Barrier Lyapunov theory proves the uniform ultimate boundedness (UUB) of the proposed method. Simulation and experimental data indicate that the control strategy reduces oscillations of errors before convergence and achieves fast and smooth formation following effect.},

This article addresses this problem for the locomotion of an amphibious snake robot, and aims at identifying fast swimming and crawling gaits for a variety of environments. Our approach uses a locomotion controller based on the biological concept of central pattern generators (CPGs) together with a gradient-free optimization method, Powell's method. A key aspect of our approach is that the gaits are optimized online, i.e., while moving, rather than as an off-line optimization process. We present various experiments with the real robot and in simulation: swimming, crawling on horizontal ground, and crawling on slopes. For each of these different situations, the optimized gaits are compared with the results of systematic explorations of the parameter space. The main outcomes of the experiments are: 1) optimal gaits are significantly different from one medium to the other; 2) the optimums are usually peaked, i.e., speed rapidly becomes suboptimal when the parameters are moved away from the optimal values; 3) our approach finds optimal gaits in much fewer iterations than the systematic search; and 4) the CPG has no problem dealing with the abrupt parameter changes during the optimization process. The relevance for robotic locomotion control is discussed.},

	abstract = {Snake robots are highly articulated mechanisms that can perform a variety of motions that conventional robots cannot. Despite many demonstrated successes of snake robots, these mechanisms have not been able to achieve the agility displayed by their biological counterparts. We suggest that studying how biological snakes coordinate whole-body motion to achieve agile behaviors can help improve the performance of snake robots. The foundation of this work is based on the hypothesis that, for snake locomotion that is approximately kinematic, replaying parameterized shape trajectory data collected from biological snakes can generate equivalent motions in snake robots. To test this hypothesis, we collected shape trajectory data from sidewinder rattlesnakes executing a variety of different behaviors. We then analyze the shape trajectory data in a concise and meaningful way by using a new algorithm, called conditioned basis array factorization, which projects high-dimensional data arrays onto a low-dimensional representation. The low-dimensional representation of the recorded snake motion is able to reproduce the essential features of the recorded biological snake motion on a snake robot, leading to improved agility and maneuverability, confirming our hypothesis. This parameterized representation allows us to search the low-dimensional parameter space to generate behaviors that further improve the performance of snake robots.},

Thus, we exclude joint angles using the averaging method to construct a simpler model. Another feature of the proposed model is that it can be derived from the original complex model without parameter identification using simulation data and without assuming straight-line movements. In addition to inequality constraints on joint angles and the frequency of joint motions, we impose constraints on the change rates of these variables in our MPC design since the averaged model is derived by assuming that these variables slowly change. Furthermore, we introduce a soft constraint to decrease the effects of approximation error of the simplified model on the control performance. The effectiveness of the control system is verified in both simulations and experiments.},

To this end, external disturbances and body orientation errors should be identified, and appropriate actions have to be taken to restore the balance of the robot and to provide advantageous landing circumstances.

The main contribution of this work is a method to adjust adaptive gait patterns to overcome unstructured terrains using the ARTU-R (A1 Rescue Task UPM Robot) quadruped robot based on a central pattern generator (CPG), and the automatic identification of terrain and characterization of its obstacles (number, size, position and superability analysis) through convolutional neural networks for pattern regulation. To develop this method, a study of dog gait patterns was carried out, with validation and adjustment through simulation on the robot model in ROS-Gazebo and subsequent transfer to the real robot. Outdoor tests were carried out to evaluate and validate the efficiency of the proposed method in terms of its percentage of success in overcoming stretches of unstructured terrains, as well as the kinematic and dynamic variables of the robot. The main results show that the proposed method has an efficiency of over 93\% for terrain characterization (identification of terrain, segmentation and obstacle characterization) and over 91\% success in overcoming unstructured terrains.

	abstract = {We propose to address quadrupedal locomotion tasks using Reinforcement Learning (RL) with a Transformer-based model that learns to combine proprioceptive information and high-dimensional depth sensor inputs. While learning-based locomotion has made great advances using RL, most methods still rely on domain randomization for training blind agents that generalize to challenging terrains. Our key insight is that proprioceptive states only offer contact measurements for immediate reaction, whereas an agent equipped with visual sensory observations can learn to proactively maneuver environments with obstacles and uneven terrain by anticipating changes in the environment many steps ahead. In this paper, we introduce LocoTransformer, an end-to-end RL method that leverages both proprioceptive states and visual observations for locomotion control. We evaluate our method in challenging simulated environments with different obstacles and uneven terrain. We transfer our learned policy from simulation to a real robot by running it indoors and in the wild with unseen obstacles and terrain. Our method not only signiﬁcantly improves over baselines, but also achieves far better generalization performance, especially when transferred to the real robot.

	abstract = {Does progress in simulation translate to progress on robots? If one method outperforms another in simulation, how likely is that trend to hold in reality on a robot? We examine this question for embodied PointGoal navigation - developing engineering tools and a research paradigm for evaluating a simulator by its sim2real predictivity. First, we develop Habitat-PyRobot Bridge (HaPy), a library for seamless execution of identical code on simulated agents and robots - transferring simulation-trained agents to a LoCoBot platform with a one-line code change. Second, we investigate the sim2real predictivity of Habitat-Sim M. Savva et al., for PointGoal navigation. We 3D-scan a physical lab space to create a virtualized replica, and run parallel tests of 9 different models in reality and simulation. We present a new metric called Sim-vs-Real Correlation Coefficient (SRCC) to quantify predictivity. We find that SRCC for Habitat as used for the CVPR19 challenge is low (0.18 for the success metric), suggesting that performance differences in this simulator-based challenge do not persist after physical deployment. This gap is largely due to AI agents learning to exploit simulator imperfections - abusing collision dynamics to `slide' along walls, leading to shortcuts through otherwise non-navigable space. Naturally, such exploits do not work in the real world. Our experiments show that it is possible to tune simulation parameters to improve sim2real predictivity (e.g. improving SRCCSucc from 0.18 to 0.844) - increasing confidence that in-simulation comparisons will translate to deployed systems in reality.},

Different from these studies, we propose a novel policy structure that appropriately incorporates physical insights gained from the hybrid nature of the walking dynamics and the well-established hybrid zero dynamics approach for 3D bipedal walking. As a result, the overall RL framework has several key advantages, including lightweight network structure, short training time, and less dependence on prior knowledge. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on Cassie, a challenging 3D bipedal robot. The proposed solution produces stable limit walking cycles that can track various walking speed in different directions. Surprisingly, without specifically trained with disturbances to achieve robustness, it also performs robustly against various adversarial forces applied to the torso towards both the forward and the backward directions.},

In this paper, we present a hierarchical framework that improves sample-efficiency and generalizability of learned locomotion skills on real-world robots. Our approach divides the problem of goal-oriented locomotion into two sub-problems: learning diverse primitives skills, and using model-based planning to sequence these skills. We parametrize our primitives as cyclic movements, improving sample-efficiency of learning from scratch on a 18 degrees of freedom robot. Then, we learn coarse dynamics models over primitive cycles and use them in a model predictive control framework. This allows us to learn to walk to arbitrary goals up to 12m away, after about two hours of training from scratch on hardware. Our results on a Daisy hexapod hardware and simulation demonstrate the efficacy of our approach at reaching distant targets, in different environments, and with sensory noise.},

The design objective of FROST is to provide a unified software environment for developing model-based control and motion planning algorithms for robotic systems whose dynamics is hybrid in nature. In particular, FROST uses directed graphs to describe the underlying discrete structure of hybrid system models, which renders it capable of representing a wide variety of robotic systems. Equipped with a custom symbolic math toolbox in MATLAB using Wolfram Mathematica, one can rapidly prototype the mathematical model of robot kinematics and dynamics and generate optimized code of symbolic expressions to boost the speed of optimization and simulation in FROST. In favor of agile and dynamic behaviors, we utilize virtual constraint based motion planning and feedback controllers for robotic systems to exploit the full-order dynamics of the model. Moreover, FROST provides a fast and tractable framework for planning optimal trajectories of hybrid dynamical systems using advanced direct collocation algorithms. FROST has been successfully used to synthesize dynamic walking in multiple bipedal robots. Case studies of such applications are considered in this paper, wherein different types of walking gaits are generated for two specific humanoid robots and validated in simulation.},

Traditional model-based locomotion controllers require simplifying assumptions and careful modelling; any small errors can result in unstable control. To address these challenges for bipedal locomotion, we present a model-free reinforcement learning framework for training robust locomotion policies in simulation, which can then be transferred to a real bipedal Cassie robot. To facilitate sim-to-real transfer, domain randomization is used to encourage the policies to learn behaviors that are robust across variations in system dynamics. The learned policies enable Cassie to perform a set of diverse and dynamic behaviors, while also being more robust than traditional controllers and prior learning-based methods that use residual control. We demonstrate this on versatile walking behaviors such as tracking a target walking velocity, walking height, and turning yaw.},

As the availability of legged robots grows, so does the need for controllers that enable these robots to perform useful skills. However, most learning-based frameworks for controller development focus on training robot-specific controllers, a process that needs to be repeated for every new robot. In this work, we introduce a framework for training generalized locomotion (GenLoco) controllers for quadrupedal robots. Our framework synthesizes general-purpose locomotion controllers that can be deployed on a large variety of quadrupedal robots with similar morphologies. We present a simple but effective morphology randomization method that procedurally generates a diverse set of simulated robots for training. We show that by training a controller on this large set of simulated robots, our models acquire more general control strategies that can be directly transferred to novel simulated and real-world robots with diverse morphologies, which were not observed during training.},

	abstract = {We present a new approach for transfer of dynamic robot control policies such as biped locomotion from simulation to real hardware. Key to our approach is to perform system identification of the model parameters \{{\textbackslash}mu\} of the hardware (e.g. friction, center-of-mass) in two distinct stages, before policy learning (pre-sysID) and after policy learning (post-sysID). Pre-sysID begins by collecting trajectories from the physical hardware based on a set of generic motion sequences. Because the trajectories may not be related to the task of interest, presysID does not attempt to accurately identify the true value of \{{\textbackslash}mu\}, but only to approximate the range of \{{\textbackslash}mu\} to guide the policy learning. Next, a Projected Universal Policy (PUP) is created by simultaneously training a network that projects \{{\textbackslash}mu\} to a low-dimensional latent variable \{{\textbackslash}eta\} and a family of policies that are conditioned on \{{\textbackslash}eta\}. The second round of system identification (post-sysID) is then carried out by deploying the PUP on the robot hardware using task-relevant trajectories. We use Bayesian Optimization to determine the values for \{{\textbackslash}eta\} that optimizes the performance of PUP on the real hardware. We have used this approach to create three successful biped locomotion controllers (walk forward, walk backwards, walk sideways) on the Darwin OP2 robot.},

	abstract = {We propose a new family of policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning, which alternate between sampling data through interaction with the environment, and optimizing a "surrogate" objective function using stochastic gradient ascent. Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.},

	abstract = {Conventional feedback control methods can solve various types of robot control problems very efficiently by capturing the structure with explicit models, such as rigid body equations of motion. However, many control problems in modern manufacturing deal with contacts and friction, which are difficult to capture with first-order physical modeling. Hence, applying control design methodologies to these kinds of problems often results in brittle and inaccurate controllers, which have to be manually tuned for deployment. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been demonstrated to be capable of learning continuous robot controllers from interactions with the environment, even for problems that include friction and contacts. In this paper, we study how we can solve difficult control problems in the real world by decomposing them into a part that is solved efficiently by conventional feedback control methods, and the residual which is solved with RL. The final control policy is a superposition of both control signals. We demonstrate our approach by training an agent to successfully perform a real-world block assembly task involving contacts and unstable objects.},

	abstract = {While quadruped robots usually have good stability and load capacity, bipedal robots offer a higher level of flexibility / adaptability to different tasks and environments. A multi-modal legged robot can take the best of both worlds. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal locomotion framework that is composed of a hand-crafted transition motion and a learning-based bipedal controller -- learnt by a novel algorithm called Automated Residual Reinforcement Learning. This framework aims to endow arbitrary quadruped robots with the ability to walk bipedally. In particular, we 1) design an additional supporting structure for a quadruped robot and a sequential multi-modal transition strategy; 2) propose a novel class of Reinforcement Learning algorithms for bipedal control and evaluate their performances in both simulation and the real world. Experimental results show that our proposed algorithms have the best performance in simulation and maintain a good performance in a real-world robot. Overall, our multi-modal robot could successfully switch between biped and quadruped, and walk in both modes. Experiment videos and code are available at https://chenaah.github.io/multimodal/.},

The CPG dynamics organized into networks allow the emergence of complex locomotor behaviors. In this work, we take this inspiration for developing walking behaviors in multi-legged robots. We present novel DeepCPG policies that embed CPGs as a layer in a larger neural network and facilitate end-to-end learning of locomotion behaviors in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) setup. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on physics engine-based insectoid robots. We show that, compared to traditional approaches, DeepCPG policies allow sample-efﬁcient end-to-end learning of effective locomotion strategies even in the case of high-dimensional sensor spaces (vision). We scale the DeepCPG policies using a modular robot conﬁguration and multiagent DRL. Our results suggest that gradual complexiﬁcation with embedded priors of these policies in a modular fashion could achieve non-trivial sensor and motor integration on a robot platform. These results also indicate the efﬁcacy of bootstrapping more complex intelligent systems from simpler ones based on biological principles. Finally, we present the experimental results for a proof-of-concept insectoid robot system for which DeepCPG learned policies initially using the simulation engine and these were afterwards transferred to real-world robots without any additional ﬁne-tuning.},

The proposed CPG model has the ability to produce stable rhythmic patterns applied both in the serpentine locomotion and sidewinding locomotion of snake robots. The global exponential stability of the model is also presented using the partial contraction theory. An important point addressed in this paper is that the proposed CPG model has explicit control parameters including not only frequencies of oscillation and amplitudes of oscillation but also phase differences between the neighbor oscillators. The method to adjust the speed and direction of the snake robot during the locomotion is discussed by modulating the control parameters in the proposed CPG model directly.

	abstract = {Bipedal locomotion skills are challenging to develop. Control strategies often use local linearization of the dynamics in conjunction with reduced-order abstractions to yield tractable solutions. In these model-based control strategies, the controller is often not fully aware of many details, including torque limits, joint limits, and other non-linearities that are necessarily excluded from the control computations for simplicity. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) offers a promising model-free approach for controlling bipedal locomotion which can more fully exploit the dynamics. However, current results in the machine learning literature are often based on ad-hoc simulation models that are not based on corresponding hardware. Thus it remains unclear how well DRL will succeed on realizable bipedal robots. In this paper, we demonstrate the effectiveness of DRL using a realistic model of Cassie, a bipedal robot. By formulating a feedback control problem as finding the optimal policy for a Markov Decision Process, we are able to learn robust walking controllers that imitate a reference motion with DRL. Controllers for different walking speeds are learned by imitating simple time-scaled versions of the original reference motion. Controller robustness is demonstrated through several challenging tests, including sensory delay, walking blindly on irregular terrain and unexpected pushes at the pelvis. We also show we can interpolate between individual policies and that robustness can be improved with an interpolated policy.},

With the ultimate goal of practical applications in real world, we further narrow our review scope to techniques that could aid in sim-to-real transfer. We categorized these techniques into four groups: 1) use of accurate simulators; 2) use of kinematic and dynamic models; 3) use of hierarchical and distributed controllers; and 4) use of demonstrations. The purposes of these four groups of techniques are to supply general and accurate environments for RL training, improve sampling efficiency, divide and conquer complex motion tasks and redundant robot structures, and acquire natural skills. We found that, by synthetically using these techniques, it is possible to deploy RL on physical BIRs in actuality.},

Therefore, it is necessary to study the gait planning of six-legged robot to adapt to complex terrain.

The main idea is training the robot through Actor-Critic network with proximal policy optimization (PPO), in which outputs are step length, step height and orientation of the robot. This is an end-to-end approach, which tries to make the robot learn by itself and finally achieve its safe arrival to the target point through complex terrains. In order to train a good model for our robots, simplified environment is adopted to accelerate the training process. We also use curriculum learning to speed up and optimize the training. Then, we verify the reliability of the method in simulation platform and finally transfer the learned model to real robot. Our experiment shows the effectiveness of deep reinforcement learning for locomotion of six-legged robots, the acceleration of the training process by means of curriculum learning, and the improvement of the training effect.},

Owing to the limitations of gathering real-world data, i.e., sample inefficiency and the cost of collecting it, simulation environments are utilized for training the different agents. This not only aids in providing a potentially infinite data source, but also alleviates safety concerns with real robots. Nonetheless, the gap between the simulated and real worlds degrades the performance of the policies once the models are transferred into real robots. Multiple research efforts are therefore now being directed towards closing this sim-to-real gap and accomplish more efficient policy transfer. Recent years have seen the emergence of multiple methods applicable to different domains, but there is a lack, to the best of our knowledge, of a comprehensive review summarizing and putting into context the different methods. In this survey paper, we cover the fundamental background behind sim-to-real transfer in deep reinforcement learning and overview the main methods being utilized at the moment: domain randomization, domain adaptation, imitation learning, meta-learning and knowledge distillation. We categorize some of the most relevant recent works, and outline the main application scenarios.

Here, we present a robust controller for blind quadrupedal locomotion in challenging natural environments. Our approach incorporates proprioceptive feedback in locomotion control and demonstrates zero-shot generalization from simulation to natural environments. The controller is trained by reinforcement learning in simulation. The controller is driven by a neural network policy that acts on a stream of proprioceptive signals. The controller retains its robustness under conditions that were never encountered during training: deformable terrains such as mud and snow, dynamic footholds such as rubble, and overground impediments such as thick vegetation and gushing water.

Experiments were run in simulation and in hardware on flat terrain and with a step down, demonstrating the robot’s self-stabilizing properties. The robot reached a running trot with short flight phases with a maximum Froude number of FR = 1.30, or 6.9 body lengths per second. Morphological parameters such as the leg design also played a role. By adding distal in-series elasticity, self-stability and maximum robot speed improved. Our robot has several advantages, especially when compared with larger and stiffer quadruped robot designs. (1) It is, to the best of the authors’ knowledge, the fastest of all quadruped robots below 30kg (in terms of Froude number and body lengths per second). (2) It shows self-stabilizing behavior over a large range of speeds with open-loop control. (3) It is lightweight, compact, and electrically powered.

	abstract = {Purpose – The paper seeks to present a new generation of torque‐controlled light‐weight robots (LWR) developed at the Institute of Robotics and Mechatronics of the German Aerospace Center. Design/methodology/approach – An integrated mechatronic design approach for LWR is presented. Owing to the partially unknown properties of the environment, robustness of planning and control with respect to environmental variations is crucial. Robustness is achieved in this context through sensor redundancy and passivity‐based control. In the DLR root concept, joint torque sensing plays a central role. Findings – In order to act in unstructured environments and interact with humans, the robots have design features and control/software functionalities which distinguish them from classical robots, such as: load‐to‐weight ratio of 1:1, torque sensing in the joints, active vibration damping, sensitive collision detection, compliant control on joint and Cartesian level. Practical implications – The DLR robots are excellent research platforms for experimentation of advanced robotics algorithms. Space and medical robotics are further areas for which these robots were designed and hopefully will be applied within the next years. Potential industrial application fields are the fast automatic assembly as well as manufacturing activities done in cooperation with humans (industrial robot assistant). The described functionalities are of course highly relevant also for the potentially huge market of service robotics. The LWR technology was transferred to KUKA Roboter GmbH, which will bring the first arms on the market in the near future. Originality/value – This paper introduces a new type of LWR with torque sensing in each joint and describes a consistent approach for using these sensors for manipulation in human environments. To the best of one's knowledge, the first systematic experimental evaluation of possible injuries during robot‐human crashes using standardized testing facilities is presented.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a framework for learning a minimum-norm stabilizing controller for a system with unknown dynamics using model-free policy optimization methods. The approach begins by first designing a Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) for a (possibly inaccurate) dynamics model for the system, along with a function which specifies a minimum acceptable rate of energy dissipation for the CLF at different points in the state-space. Treating the energy dissipation condition as a constraint on the desired closed-loop behavior of the real-world system, we use penalty methods to formulate an unconstrained optimization problem over the parameters of a learned controller, which can be solved using model-free policy optimization algorithms using data collected from the plant. We discuss when the optimization learns a stabilizing controller for the real world system and derive conditions on the structure of the learned controller which ensure that the optimization is strongly convex, meaning the globally optimal solution can be found reliably. We validate the approach in simulation, first for a double pendulum, and then generalize the framework to learn stable walking controllers for underactuated bipedal robots using the Hybrid Zero Dynamics framework. By encoding a large amount of structure into the learning problem, we are able to learn stabilizing controllers for both systems with only minutes or even seconds of training data.},

	abstract = {We have built a 12DOF, passive-compliant legged, tailed biped actuated by four brushless DC motors. We anticipate that this machine will achieve varied modes of quasistatic and dynamic balance, enabling a broad range of locomotion tasks including sitting, standing, walking, hopping, running, turning, leaping, and more. Achieving this diversity of behavior with a single under-actuated body, requires a correspondingly diverse array of controllers, motivating our interest in compositional techniques that promote mixing and reuse of a relatively few base constituents to achieve a combinatorially growing array of available choices. Here we report on the development of one important example of such a behavioral programming method, the construction of a novel monopedal sagittal plane hopping gait through parallel composition of four decoupled 1DOF base controllers. For this example behavior, the legs are locked in phase and the body is fastened to a boom to restrict motion to the sagittal plane. The platform's locomotion is powered by the hip motor that adjusts leg touchdown angle in flight and balance in stance, along with a tail motor that adjusts body shape in flight and drives energy into the passive leg shank spring during stance. The motor control signals arise from the application in parallel of four simple, completely decoupled 1DOF feedback laws that provably stabilize in isolation four corresponding 1DOF abstract reference plants. Each of these abstract 1DOF closed loop dynamics represents some simple but crucial specific component of the locomotion task at hand. We present a partial proof of correctness for this parallel composition of template reference systems along with data from the physical platform suggesting these templates are anchored as evidenced by the correspondence of their characteristic motions with a suitably transformed image of traces from the physical platform.},

Using a nominal dynamics model, the user speciﬁes a candidate Control Lyapunov Function (CLF) around the desired operating point, and speciﬁes the desired safe-set using a Control Barrier Function (CBF). Using penalty methods from the optimization literature, we then develop a family of policy optimization problems which attempt to minimize control eﬀort while satisfying the pointwise constraints used to specify the CLF and CBF. We demonstrate that when the penalty terms are scaled correctly, the optimization prioritizes the maintenance of safety over stability, and stability over optimality. We discuss how standard reinforcement learning algorithms can be applied to the problem, and validate the approach through simulation. We then illustrate how the approach can be applied to a class of hybrid models commonly used in the dynamic walking literature, and use it to learn safe, stable walking behavior over a randomly spaced sequence of stepping stones.},

	abstract = {The great terrain adaptability of legged robots, their capacity to distribute forces among their legs and potential to benefit from manipulating objects like carrying sensing payloads, makes them particularly suited for load carrying applications. In this paper, we address the problem of optimizing the joint-torques of articulated legged robots while performing such physically strenuous tasks. We propose an inexpensive optimization-based strategy designed to achieve arbitrary robot configurations while minimizing the commanded torques, to keep them within the physical limits of each actuator. Specifically, by first advancing our understanding of the relationship between the ground reaction forces at the robot’s feet and torques in the robot’s joints, we are able to pose a simple minimax optimization problem that can be solved online and rapidly to yield optimized torque commands. In doing so, our approach is essentially able to manipulate the ground reaction forces at the robot’s feet to increase/decrease internal moments in the robot’s body, such that the final torques that must be commanded by each actuator remains within its limits. We experimentally validate our approach in static and walking tests, where a series-elastic hexapod robot carries payloads of varying weight, and show that our method results in lower overall torques and lower average individual actuator effort.},

In addition to rough terrain, they may confront unexpected impact forces during their leaping gaits. While facing external disturbances, legged robots should maintain and (if necessary) restore their stability while completing their gaits. To this end, external disturbances and body orientation errors should be identified, and appropriate actions have to be taken to restore the balance of the robot and to provide advantageous landing circumstances. This paper briefly surveys the developments for balance and posture control of legged robots. The primary focus of these studies is on balancing legged robots under external disturbances or performing dynamic gaits.

	abstract = {Most autonomous navigation systems assume wheeled robots are rigid bodies and their 2D planar workspaces can be divided into free spaces and obstacles. However, recent wheeled mobility research, showing that wheeled platforms have the potential of moving over vertically challenging terrain (e.g., rocky outcroppings, rugged boulders, and fallen tree trunks), invalidate both assumptions. Navigating off-road vehicle chassis with long suspension travel and low tire pressure in places where the boundary between obstacles and free spaces is blurry requires precise 3D modeling of the interaction between the chassis and the terrain, which is complicated by suspension and tire deformation, varying tire-terrain friction, vehicle weight distribution and momentum, etc. In this paper, we present a learning approach to model wheeled mobility, i.e., in terms of vehicle-terrain forward dynamics, and plan feasible, stable, and efficient motion to drive over vertically challenging terrain without rolling over or getting stuck. We present physical experiments on two wheeled robots and show that planning using our learned model can achieve up to 60\% improvement in navigation success rate and 46\% reduction in unstable chassis roll and pitch angles.},

	abstract = {Some methods of mobile manipulator control for the articulated body mobile robot "KORYU (KR)" are analyzed. KR is a class of mobile robot composed of serially connected "unit segments", configuring a long articulated body which resembles a train or a snake in shape. This configuration has an intrinsic advantage of making possible the use of the body's degrees of freedom (DOF) not only for "locomotion", but also for "manipulation". In order to demonstrate this characteristic we built a real mechanical model called KR-II, equipped with a 2 DOF manipulator in its foremost part. In the paper, two configurations for augmenting the number of this manipulator DOF are considered. The first method "fixed manipulator" considers the robot fixed to the ground, so that the manipulation control issue can be studied using well-known standard manipulator control theories. In the second method "mobile manipulator" special attention is paid to integrating manipulation tasks with body locomotion (steering) freedom. We verify that mobile manipulation can be smoothly integrated with a steering control method already developed in earlier works. Experimental results are shown to demonstrate the validity of the proposed augmented manipulation configurations and respective control methods.},

To perform a manipulation task, we extend the front links of the robot to form a manipulator-part, where the remaining links form a helical base that wraps around the pipe. In the proposed approach, the motion of the manipulator-part is combined with a rolling motion performed by the base-part. This results in enhanced rotational ability of the end-effector, without the need to install an additional rotary motor. The stability of the robot structure is also improved via the resulting tightening force between the helical base-part and the pipe. The kinematics of the proposed robot arrangement is represented considering a dynamically changing contact point between the links of the helical base and the pipe. To realize the proposed method, we introduce a two-level controller that enables the manipulator-part and the helical base to work simultaneously during manipulation. The experimental results showed the validity of the proposed method to track various trajectories and carry out manipulation tasks using a typical snake robot without extra actuators.},

The kinematic model considering two regulated points is determined as a switched system that is switched by lifting a few wheels. The system becomes a kinematically redundant system by the lifting of the wheels; however, it has to prevent two types of singular configurations; one is the traditional one, and the other is caused by regulating two points simultaneously. Using this redundancy and selecting the lifted wheels, we design a trajectory tracking controller for two points by preventing the two types of singular configurations. The effectiveness of the proposed control method was demonstrated by tracking experiments as well as applications, namely, the transportation of an object by caging manipulation and the steering of a handcart.},

In particular, desert-dwelling sidewinder rattlesnakes (Crotalus cerastes) operate effectively on inclined granular media (such as sand dunes) that induce failure in field-tested limbless robots through slipping and pitching. Our laboratory experiments reveal that as granular incline angle increases, sidewinder rattlesnakes increase the length of their body in contact with the sand. Implementing this strategy in a physical robot model of the snake enables the device to ascend sandy slopes close to the angle of maximum slope stability. Plate drag experiments demonstrate that granular yield stresses decrease with increasing incline angle. Together, these three approaches demonstrate how sidewinding with contact-length control mitigates failure on granular media.},

A fundamental component of a state estimator in legged platforms is Leg Odometry, which only requires information about kinematics and contacts. Many legged robots use dedicated sensors on each foot to detect ground contacts. However, this choice is impractical for many agile legged robots in field operations, as these sensors often degrade and break. Instead, this paper focuses on the development of a robust Leg Odometry module, which does not require contact sensors. The module estimates the probability of reliable contact and detects foot impacts using internal force sensing. This knowledge is then used to improve the kinematics-inertial state estimate of the robot's base. We show how our approach can reach comparable performance to systems with foot sensors. Extensive experimental results lasting over 1 h are presented on our 85 kg quadrupedal robot HyQ carrying out a variety of gaits.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces an optimization-based framework for robust multilegged walking motion planning. Previous approaches use fixed gait sequences, and rely on Zero Moment Point (ZMP) to guarantee dynamic stability. While this combination works well on flat ground, it does not generalize to uneven terrain requiring aggressive gait or gait transition. To overcome such difficulties, in this paper, we present an optimization framework, that can plan both the contact location and gait sequence simultaneously in a mixed-integer convex optimization program. Moreover, we rely on the Contact Wrench Cone (CWC) stability criterion, which generalizes the ZMP criterion to uneven terrain with friction cone constraints, and we plan the walking motion together with the angular momentum through a convex optimization program. Our approach is successfully tested on a LittleDog quadruped over simulated scenarios. We show that on the flat ground, our planner generates a periodic gait, same as Central Pattern Generator + ZMP planner; while on uneven terrain, our planner can successfully generate a motion containing different gaits, with a center-of-mass motion that respects the friction cone constraints, which are violated by ZMP planners. This improvement clearly demonstrates the advantage of our approach over traditional planning strategies.},

However, reasoning about contacts and motions simultaneously is crucial for the generation of complex whole-body behaviors. Currently, coupling theses problems has required either the assumption of a fixed gait sequence and flat terrain condition, or non-convex optimization with intractable computation time. In this paper, we propose a mixed-integer convex formulation to plan simultaneously contact locations, gait transitions and motion, in a computationally efficient fashion. In contrast to previous works, our approach is not limited to flat terrain nor to a pre-specified gait sequence. Instead, we incorporate the friction cone stability margin, approximate the robot's torque limits, and plan the gait using mixed-integer convex constraints. We experimentally validated our approach on the HyQ robot by traversing different challenging terrains, where non-convexity and flat terrain assumptions might lead to sub-optimal or unstable plans. Our method increases the motion generality while keeping a low computation time.},

	abstract = {Intuitively representing the motion of a snake robot is difficult. This is in part because the internal shape changes that the robot uses to locomote involve the entire body and no single point on the robot intuitively represents the robot’s pose at all times. To address this issue, we present a method of defining body coordinate frames that departs from the typical convention of rigidly fixing a frame to a link on the robot, and instead define a body frame that is based on the averaged position of all of the robot’s links. This averaged frame serves as a virtual chassis that effectively isolates the internal motion of the robot’s shape changes from the external motion, due to the robot’s interaction with its surroundings. This separation of motion allows much simpler models—such as those derived for wheeled vehicles—to accurately approximate the motion of the robot as it moves through the world. We demonstrate the practical advantages of using the virtual chassis body frame by estimating the pitch and roll of a snake robot undergoing dynamic motion by fusing readings from its internal encoders, gyros, and accelerometers with an extended Kalman filter.},

	abstract = {Snake robots, sometimes called hyper-redundant mechanisms, can use their many degrees of freedom to achieve a variety of locomotive capabilities. These capabilities are ideally suited for disaster response because the snake robot can thread through tightly packed volumes, accessing locations that people and conventional machinery otherwise cannot. Snake robots also have the advantage of possessing a variety of locomotion capabilities that conventional robots do not. Just like their biological counterparts, snake robots achieve these locomotion capabilities using cyclic motions called gaits. These cyclic motions directly control the snake robot's internal degrees of freedom which, in turn, causes a net motion, say forward, lateral and rotational, for the snake robot. The gaits described in this paper fall into two categories: parameterized and scripted. The parameterized gaits, as their name suggests, can be described by a relative simple parameterized function, whereas the scripted cannot. This paper describes the functions we prescribed for gait generation and our experiences in making these robots operate in real experiments.},

The first main novelty is a tightly integrated visual-inertial SLAM system that fully relies on maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation, even during IMU initialization, resulting in real-time robust operation in small and large, indoor and outdoor environments, being two to ten times more accurate than previous approaches. The second main novelty is a multiple map system relying on a new place recognition method with improved recall that lets ORB-SLAM3 survive to long periods of poor visual information: when it gets lost, it starts a new map that will be seamlessly merged with previous maps when revisiting them. Compared with visual odometry systems that only use information from the last few seconds, ORB-SLAM3 is the first system able to reuse in all the algorithm stages all previous information from high parallax co-visible keyframes, even if they are widely separated in time or come from previous mapping sessions, boosting accuracy. Our experiments show that, in all sensor configurations, ORB-SLAM3 is as robust as the best systems available in the literature and significantly more accurate. Notably, our stereo-inertial SLAM achieves an average accuracy of 3.5 cm in the EuRoC drone and 9 mm under quick hand-held motions in the room of TUM-VI dataset, representative of AR/VR scenarios.

The goal of this survey is to cover the recent progress toward these applications that has been driven by model-based optimization for the real-time generation and control of movement. The majority of the research community has converged on the idea of generating locomotion control laws by solving an optimal control problem (OCP) in either a model-based or data-driven manner. However, solving the most general of these problems online remains intractable due to complexities from intermittent unidirectional contacts with the environment, and from the many degrees of freedom of legged robots. This survey covers methods that have been pursued to make these OCPs computationally tractable, with specific focus on how environmental contacts are treated, how the model can be simplified, and how these choices affect the numerical solution methods employed. The survey focuses on model-based optimization, covering its recent use in a stand alone fashion, and suggesting avenues for combination with learning-based formulations to further accelerate progress in this growing field.},

	doi = {10.1109/HUMANOIDS.2014.7041375},
	abstract = {To plan dynamic, whole-body motions for robots, one conventionally faces the choice between a complex, full-body dynamic model containing every link and actuator of the robot, or a highly simplified model of the robot as a point mass. In this paper we explore a powerful middle ground between these extremes. We exploit the fact that while the full dynamics of humanoid robots are complicated, their centroidal dynamics (the evolution of the angular momentum and the center of mass (COM) position) are much simpler. By treating the dynamics of the robot in centroidal form and directly optimizing the joint trajectories for the actuated degrees of freedom, we arrive at a method that enjoys simpler dynamics, while still having the expressiveness required to handle kinematic constraints such as collision avoidance or reaching to a target. We further require that the robot's COM and angular momentum as computed from the joint trajectories match those given by the centroidal dynamics. This ensures that the dynamics considered by our optimization are equivalent to the full dynamics of the robot, provided that the robot's actuators can supply sufficient torque. We demonstrate that this algorithm is capable of generating highly-dynamic motion plans with examples of a humanoid robot negotiating obstacle course elements and gait optimization for a quadrupedal robot. Additionally, we show that we can plan without pre-specifying the contact sequence by exploiting the complementarity conditions between contact forces and contact distance.},

To create the Super Servo, we have replaced the electronics in a hobby servo, adding such components as sensors to monitor current and temperature, a communications bus, and a programmable microcontroller. Any robust solution must also protect components from hazardous environments such as sand and brush. To resolve this problem we insert the robots into skins that cover their surface. Functions such as climbing the inside and outside of a pipe add a new dimension of interaction. Thus we attach a compliant, high-friction material to every module, which assists in tasks that require gripping. This combination of the mechanical and electrical architectures results in a robust and versatile robot.},

	abstract = {Snake robot locomotion in a cluttered environment where the snake robot utilises a sensory-perceptual system to perceive the surrounding operational environment for means of propulsion is defined as perception-driven obstacle-aided locomotion (POAL). From a control point of view, achieving POAL with traditional rigidly-actuated robots is challenging because of the complex interaction between the snake robot and the immediate environment. To simplify the control complexity, compliant motion and fine torque control on each joint is essential. Accordingly, intrinsically elastic joints have become progressively prominent over the last years for a variety robotic applications. Commonly, elastic joints are considered to outperform rigid actuation in terms of peak dynamics, robustness, and energy efficiency. Even though a few examples of elastic snake robots exist, they are generally expensive to manufacture and tailored to custom-made hardware/software components that are not openly available off-the-shelf. In this work, Serpens, a newly-designed low-cost, open-source and highly-compliant multi-purpose modular snake robot with series elastic actuator (SEA) is presented. Serpens features precision torque control and stereoscopic vision. Only low-cost commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) components are adopted. The robot modules can be 3D-printed by using Fused Deposition Modelling (FDM) manufacturing technology, thus making the rapid-prototyping process very economical and fast. A screw-less assembly mechanism allows for connecting the modules and reconfigure the robot in a very reliable and robust manner. The concept of modularity is also applied to the system architecture on both the software and hardware sides. Each module is independent, being controlled by a self-reliant controller board. The software architecture is based on the Robot Operating System (ROS). This paper describes the design of Serpens and presents preliminary simulation and experimental results, which illustrate its performance.},

It is constructed of a series of articulated links, each one with a motor and linear solenoid. Although each link has only one motor, this structure allows the body configuration to be easily controlled thereby enabling the robot to move in very cluttered environments. The motion planning system provides the robot with a basic motion pattern that can be easily modified for different tasks and environments. The mechanical snake does not avoid obstacles on its way, but rather "accommodates" them by continuing its motion towards the target while in contact with the obstacles. With the authors' design and motion planning, each link has a different number of degrees-of-freedom in each motion stage, providing the robot with great adaptability even during contact with obstacles in a cluttered environment.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

To attain POAL from a control standpoint, the accurate identification of push-points and reliable determination of feasible contact reaction forces are required. This is difficult to achieve with rigidly actuated robots because of the lack of compliance. As a possible solution to this challenge, our research group recently presented Serpens, a low-cost, open-source, and highly compliant multi-purpose modular snake robot with a series elastic actuator (SEA). In this paper, we propose a new prototyping iteration for our snake robot to achieve a more dependable design. The following three contributions are outlined in this work as a whole: the remodelling of the elastic joint with the addition of a damper element; a refreshed design for the screw-less assembly mechanism that can now withstand higher transverse forces; the re-design of the joint module with an improved reorganisation of the internal hardware components to facilitate heat dissipation and to accommodate a larger battery with easier access. The Robot Operating System (ROS) serves as the foundation for the software architecture. The possibility of applying machine learning approaches is considered. The results of preliminary simulations are provided.},

	abstract = {Despite advances in a diversity of environments, snake robots are still far behind snakes in traversing complex 3-D terrain with large obstacles. This is due to a lack of understanding of how to control 3-D body bending to push against terrain features to generate and control propulsion. Biological studies suggested that generalist snakes use contact force sensing to adjust body bending in real time to do so. However, studying this sensory-modulated force control in snakes is challenging, due to a lack of basic knowledge of how their force sensing organs work. Here, we take a robophysics approach to make progress, starting by developing a snake robot capable of 3-D body bending with contact force sensing to enable systematic locomotion experiments and force measurements. Through two development and testing iterations, we created a 12-segment robot with 36 piezo-resistive sheet sensors distributed on all segments with compliant shells with a sampling frequency of 30 Hz. The robot measured contact forces while traversing a large obstacle using vertical bending with high repeatability, achieving the goal of providing a platform for systematic experiments. Finally, we explored model-based calibration considering the viscoelastic behavior of the piezo-resistive sensor, which will for useful for future studies.},

The feedforward component is generated from centrally connected pattern generators (CPGs)in conjunction with nonlinear robot dynamics. A nonlinear integral sliding mode (ISMC) feedback method regulates these rhythmic patterns to adjust robot stability and robustness in the presence of parameter uncertainties and external disturbances. The proposed control strategy is developed, implemented and tested for the spherical robot on both smooth and irregular surfaces. The robot performance is quantified by measuring the stability in roll angle and wheel velocities. Experimental results show that proposed novel strategy is efficient in producing a stable rolling gait and robust control of a spherical robot on different types of surface conditions.},

Specifically, we propose to explore a novel bio-inspired concept that provides accessibility to harsh territories on Mars while maintaining the necessary robustness and agility. The Spider Rolling Robot (SRR) imitates a Golden Wheel spider's characteristics with rolling, jumping, and folding capabilities. This concept will explore the rough terrains of Mars and gather data from its deep craters and crevasses that are inaccessible to current landers and rovers. The Golden wheel spider uses rolling down a sloped surface on its legs to escape its predators. The proposed robot will evade obstacles by using a sphere containing several legs on the exterior to contact the ground. When given enough power, the legs will move in concert with the sphere. In this paper, the dynamic properties, fabrication process, and progress will be explored and presented.},

	abstract = {Planetary surface exploration technology over the past few years has seen significant advancements on multiple fronts. Robotic exploration platforms are becoming more sophisticated and capable of embarking on more challenging missions. More unconventional designs, particularly transforming architectures that have multiple modes of locomotion, are being studied. This work explores the capabilities of one such novel transforming rover called the Transforming Roving-Rolling Explorer (TRREx). Biologically inspired by the armadillo and the golden-wheel spider, the TRREx has two modes of locomotion: it can traverse on six wheels like a conventional rover on benign terrain, but can transform into a sphere when necessary to negotiate steep rugged slopes. The ability to self-propel in the spherical configuration, even in the absence of a negative gradient, increases the TRREx's versatility and its concept value. This paper describes construction and testing of a prototype cylindrical TRREx that demonstrates that “actuated rolling” can be achieved, and also presents a dynamic model of this prototype version of the TRREx that can be used to investigate the feasibility and value of such self-propelled locomotion. Finally, we present results that validate our dynamic model by comparing results from computer simulations made using the dynamic model to experimental results acquired from test runs using the prototype.},

	abstract = {Robots for entertainment are currently very popular, and a variety of systems have been developed. Inspired by the image of snowman and Chinese traditional toy tumbler, we have developed a rolling robot, Loobot, for entertainment. In the shape of a snowman that consists of a spherical head and a spherical body, the robot can dance and move by rolling. Moreover, Loobot supports multiple interactive features such as speech recognition, face tracking and remote communication. Combining these features with the ingenious rolling locomotion makes Loobot more interactive and differentiates the robot from other entertainment robots that are actually screens on wheels. In this paper, we introduce the functions of the rolling robot, focusing on the design and control of its rolling locomotion. The act of rolling is driven by a 2-Dof pendulum with counter-weight (ballast mass) to produce a gravitational torque. Due to its incomplete spherical structure, control of Loobot is different to some extent from that of a spherical robot. Stable dancing and running is a key issue. In existing literature of spherical robots, the dynamic models do not fit in with Loobot. Dynamics of the robot is derived and a simple decoupled stabilization controller is proposed, which is independent on its system parameters.},

	abstract = {Reconfigurable modular robots have the ability to use different gaits and configurations to perform various tasks. A rolling gait is the fastest currently implemented gait available for traversal over level ground and shows dramatic improvements in efficiency. In this work, we analyze and implement a sensor-based feedback controller to achieve dynamic rolling for a loop robot. The robot senses its position relative to the ground and changes its shape as it rolls. This shape is such that its center of gravity is maintained to be in front of its contact point with the ground, so in effect the robot is continuously falling and thus accelerates forward. Using simulation and experimental results, we show how the desired shape can be varied to achieve higher terminal velocities. The highest velocity achieved in this work is 26 module lengths per second (1.6 m/s) which is believed to be the fastest gait yet implemented for an untethered modular robot. One of the major findings is that more elongated shapes achieve higher terminal velocities than rounder shapes. We demonstrate that this trend holds going up inclines as well as down. We show that rounder shapes have lower specific resistance and are thus more energy efficient. The control scheme is scalable to an arbitrary number of modules, shown here using eight to 14 modules.},

Exploratory robots are often limited to wheels as the mode of transportation, but there are so many more options, each with its own benefits and uses. This work focuses on the design and development of various rolling robots for planetary exploration. Specifically, these rolling robots are being designed for the exploration of the Martian surface.

Using different height points located on the symmetric centerline of the workspace of the CoM as via points, the CoM trajectory is planned by combining cubic polynomials with Bézier curves based on quadratic Bernstein polynomials. Herein, the system energy consumption is obtained by integrating the product of generalized velocity and generalized force versus time, where the generalized force is calculated by Lagrange’s equation including the Rayleigh dissipation function. Then, two schemes of dynamic rolling are proposed to compare, and the theoretical results show that the system consumes less energy under the sinusoid scheme when the via point height is lower and the via point of higher height is more suitable under the modified trapezoidal curve scheme. Furthermore, this paper combines the locomotion simulation software to design the locomotion of the mechanism’s CoM trajectory under two schemes in detail and verifies the correctness of the theoretical results.},

Instead of starting from a pre-defined movement pattern such as a serpenoid curve, we use a Model Predictive Control (MPC) approach to automatically generate effective locomotion gaits via trajectory optimization. An important advantage of this approach is that the resulting gaits are automatically adapted to the environment that is being modeled as part of the snake dynamics. To illustrate this, we use a novel model for anisotropic dry friction, along with existing models for viscous friction and fluid dynamic effects such as drag and added mass. For each of these models, gaits generated without any change in the method or its parameters are as efficient as Pareto-optimal serpenoid gaits tuned individually for each environment. Furthermore, the proposed method can also produce more complex or irregular gaits, e.g. for obstacle avoidance or executing sharp turns.},

While MPC has an advantage in that inequality constraints can be explicitly considered in control design, most of the previous simplified models are still too complex to apply to MPC since the models include joint angles as time-varying parameters. Thus, we exclude joint angles using the averaging method to construct a simpler model. Another feature of the proposed model is that it can be derived from the original complex model without parameter identification using simulation data and without assuming straight-line movements. In addition to inequality constraints on joint angles and the frequency of joint motions, we impose constraints on the change rates of these variables in our MPC design since the averaged model is derived by assuming that these variables slowly change. Furthermore, we introduce a soft constraint to decrease the effects of approximation error of the simplified model on the control performance. The effectiveness of the control system is verified in both simulations and experiments.},

We show recursive feasibility of the MPC optimization problem, where some of the developed techniques are also applicable for the analysis of a more general class of system. Besides, we provide performance results and illustrate the achieved performance by numerical simulations.

	abstract = {Snake-like robots with 3D locomotion ability have significant advantages of adaptive travelling in diverse complex terrain over traditional legged or wheeled mobile robots. Despite numerous developed gaits, these snake-like robots suffer from unsmooth gait transitions by changing the locomotion speed, direction, and body shape, which would potentially cause undesired movement and abnormal torque. Hence, there exists a knowledge gap for snake-like robots to achieve autonomous locomotion. To address this problem, this paper presents the smooth slithering gait transition control based on a lightweight central pattern generator (CPG) model for snake-like robots. First, based on the convergence behavior of the gradient system, a lightweight CPG model with fast computing time was designed and compared with other widely adopted CPG models. Then, by reshaping the body into a more stable geometry, the slithering gait was modified, and studied based on the proposed CPG model, including the gait transition of locomotion speed, moving direction, and body shape. In contrast to sinusoid-based method, extensive simulations and prototype experiments finally demonstrated that smooth slithering gait transition can be effectively achieved using the proposed CPG-based control method without generating undesired locomotion and abnormal torque.},

One of the interesting features of a biological snake is its ability to avoid obstacles or a barrier by turning its whole body from its trajectory. This special obstacle avoidance motion is different from other types of animal, and thus, it is worth to be analyzed and realized into a snake-like robot. The paper first briefly explains: 1) the phase oscillator model which represents the CPG model and 2) the CPG network. Next, we address several issues related to the existing/typical turning control of a snake-like robot. We then propose the phase transition method utilizing the phase difference control parameter to realize the turning motion of a snake-like robot. We also introduce a new parameter to control the turning of the robot, where it provides a way to incorporate sensory feedback into the CPG model. Simulation results show that the proposed turning method can be used efficiently as an obstacle avoidance method for a snake-like robot.},

According to the CPG mechanism, a hierarchical CCPG model (HCCPG) with small complexity is proposed to implement the three-dimensional gaits better. The HCCPG has a two-layers structure, namely the basic rhythmic signal generation layer and the output signal modulation layer. The HCCPG can generate three-dimensional gaits well and is extendable. Based on the HCCPG, a three-dimensional gait control method is proposed. The simulations and experiments validate this method.},

The proposed robot system has modular structures with extendable length. It is subdivided into body, neck, head and tail modules. Each body module has two rotary motors to generate pitch and yaw motions of the snake robot. A linear actuator is also installed inside each body module in order to change the length of robot. The neck module in the robot is provided with two rotary motors to make the spherical motion of head module. Neural oscillator based central pattern generators (CPG) are used to produce rhythmic patterns for various snake robot movements, for example, serpentine, side-winding, two-step-concertina and four-step-concertina motions are generated in the snake robot using the proposed CPG algorithm. For serpentine motion, the body of robot is bent to form the planar sinusoidal waveform using whole body modules on the ground. To generate side-winding motion, the robot body is bent in such a way that it makes two dimensional sinusoidal waveform and only a few points of its body make contacts with the ground. By using the CPG algorithm, these contact points are propagated from tail to head, and the robot is ultimately moved along one side. In concertina motion, the body is sequentially pushed forward in steps from tail to head using the proposed algorithm. Finally several experiments are conducted on a laboratory floor in order to confirm the authenticity of robot design and CPG algorithm so that the comparison between different motions can be achieved.},

The proposed CPG model has the ability to produce stable rhythmic patterns applied both in the serpentine locomotion and sidewinding locomotion of snake robots. The global exponential stability of the model is also presented using the partial contraction theory. An important point addressed in this paper is that the proposed CPG model has explicit control parameters including not only frequencies of oscillation and amplitudes of oscillation but also phase differences between the neighbor oscillators. The method to adjust the speed and direction of the snake robot during the locomotion is discussed by modulating the control parameters in the proposed CPG model directly.

For complex humanoid robots collision handling is obviously significantly more complex than for classical static manipulators. In particular, the robot stability during the collision reaction phase has to be carefully designed and relies on high fidelity contact information that is generated during the first three phases. In this paper, a unified realtime algorithm is presented for determining unknown contact forces and contact locations for humanoid robots based on proprioceptive sensing only, i.e. joint position, velocity and torque, as well as force/torque sensing along the structure. The proposed scheme is based on nonlinear model-based momentum observers that are able to recover the unknown contact forces and the respective locations. The dynamic loads acting on internal force/torque sensors are also corrected based on a novel nonlinear compensator. The theoretical capabilities of the presented methods are evaluated in simulation with the Atlas robot. In summary, we propose a full solution to the problem of collision detection, collision isolation and collision identification for the general class of humanoid robots.},

	abstract = {There have been several successful implementations of bio-inspired legged robots that can trot, walk, and hop robustly even in the presence of significant unplanned disturbances. Despite all of these accomplishments, practical control and high-level decision-making algorithms in multimodal legged systems are overlooked. In nature, animals such as birds impressively showcase multiple modes of mobility including legged and aerial locomotion. They are capable of performing robust locomotion over large walls, tight spaces, and can recover from unpredictable situations such as sudden gusts or slippery surfaces. Inspired by these animals’ versatility and ability to combine legged and aerial mobility to negotiate their environment, our main goal is to design and control legged robots that integrate two completely different forms of locomotion, ground and aerial mobility, in a single platform. Our robot, the Husky Carbon, is being developed to integrate aerial and legged locomotion and to transform between legged and aerial mobility. This work utilizes a Reference Governor (RG) based on low-level control of Husky’s dynamical model to maintain the efficiency of legged locomotion, uses Probabilistic Road Maps (PRM) and 3D A⋆ algorithms to generate an optimal path based on the energetic cost of transport for legged and aerial mobility.},

	abstract = {Flying animals possess highly complex physical characteristics and are capable of performing agile maneuvers using their wings. The flapping wings generate complex wake structures that influence the aerodynamic forces, which can be difficult to model. While it is possible to model these forces using fluidstructure interaction, it is very computationally expensive and difficult to formulate. In this paper, we follow a simpler approach by deriving the aerodynamic forces using a relatively small number of states and presenting them in a simple state-space form. The formulation utilizes Prandtl's lifting line theory and Wagner's function to determine the unsteady aerodynamic forces acting on the wing in a simulation, which then are compared to experimental data of the bat-inspired robot called the Aerobat. The simulated trailingedge vortex shedding can be evaluated from this model, which then can be analyzed for a wake-based gait design approach to improve the aerodynamic performance of the robot.},

There are technical hardware and control challenges in copying the morphing wing flight capabilities of flying animals. This work is majorly focused on the modeling and control aspects of stable, tail-less, morphing wing flight. A classical control approach using bang-bang control is proposed to stabilize a bio-inspired morphing wing robot called Aerobat. Robot-environment interactions based on horseshoe vortex shedding and Wagner functions is derived to realistically evaluate the feasibility of the bang-bang control, which is then implemented on the robot in experiments to demonstrate first-time closed-loop stable flights of Aerobat.},

By combining two distinct locomotion mechanisms, LEONARDO achieves complex maneuvers that require delicate balancing, such as walking on a slackline and skateboarding, which are challenging for existing bipedal robots. LEONARDO also demonstrates agile walking motions, interlaced with flying maneuvers to overcome obstacles using synchronized control of propellers and leg joints. The mechanical design and synchronized control strategy achieve a unique multimodal locomotion capability that could potentially enable robotic missions and operations that would be difficult for single-modal locomotion robots.},

	abstract = {Fluidic locomotion of flapping Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) can be very complex, particularly when the rules from insect flight dynamics (fast flapping dynamics and light wings) are not applicable. In these situations, widely used averaging techniques can fail quickly. The primary motivation is to find efficient models for complex forms of aerial locomotion where wings constitute a large part of body mass (i.e., dominant inertial effects) and deform in multiple directions (i.e., morphing wing). In these systems, high degrees of freedom yields complex inertial, Coriolis, and gravity terms. We use Algorithmic Differentiation (AD) and Bayesian filters computed with cubature rules conjointly to quickly estimate complex fluid-structure interactions. In general, Bayesian filters involve finding complex numerical integration (e.g., find posterior integrals). Using cubature rules to compute Gaussian-weighted integrals and AD, we show that the complex multi-degrees-of-freedom dynamics of morphing MAVs can be computed very efficiently and accurately. Therefore, our work facilitates closed-loop feedback control of these morphing MAVs.},

There are prohibitive design restrictions such as tight power budget and payload, which can particularly become important in aerial flights. To address these challenges, we pose a problem called the Mobility Value of Added Mass (MVAM) problem. In the MVAM problem, we attempt to allocate mass in our designs such that the energetic performance is affected the least. To solve the MVAM problem, we adopted a generative design approach using Grasshopper’s evolutionary solver to synthesize a parametric design space for Husky. Then, this space was searched for the morphologies that could yield a minimized Total Cost Of Transport (TCOT) and payload. This approach revealed that a front heavy quadrupedal robot can achieve a lower TCOT while retaining larger margins on allowable added mass to its design. Based on this framework Husky was built and tested as a front heavy robot.},

Bats exclusively use this capability with structural flexibility to generate the controlled force distribution on each wing membrane.

In contrast with other flying vertebrates, bats have an extremely articulated musculoskeletal system which is key to their energetic efficiency with impressively adaptive and multimodal locomotion. Biomimicry of this flight apparatus is a significant engineering ordeal and we seek to achieve mechanical intelligence through sophisticated interactions of morphology. Such morphological computation or mechanical intelligence draws our attention to the obvious fact that there is a common interconnection between the boundaries of morphology and closed-loop feedback. In this work, we demonstrate that several biologically meaningful degrees of freedom can be interconnected to one another by mechanical intelligence and, as a result, the responsibility of feedback-driven components (e.g., actuated joints) is subsumed under computational morphology. The results reported in this work significantly contribute to the design of bio-inspired Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) with articulated body and attributes such as efficiency, safety, and collision-tolerance.},

The challenges include underactuation, vulnerability to external perturbations, and high computational complexity that arise when accounting for the system full-dynamics and environmental interactions. In this work, we study the potential roles of thrusters in addressing some of these locomotion challenges in bipedal robotics. We will introduce a thruster-assisted bipedal robot called Harpy. We will capitalize on Harpy’s unique design to propose an optimization-free approach to satisfy gait feasibility conditions. In this thruster-assisted legged locomotion, the reference trajectories can be manipulated to fulfill constraints brought on by ground contact and those prescribed for states and inputs. Unintended changes to the trajectories, especially those optimized to produce periodic orbits, can adversely affect gait stability and hybrid invariance. We will show our approach can still guarantee stability and hybrid invariance of the gaits by employing the thrusters in Harpy. We will also show that the thrusters can be leveraged to robustify the gaits by dodging fallovers or jumping over large obstacles.},

This paper presents the derivation of a multi-body dynamical system of a bio-inspired bat robot called Aerobat which captures multiple biologically meaningful degrees-of-freedom for flapping flight that is present in biological bats. Then, the work attempts to manifest closed-loop aerial body reorientation and preparation for landing through the manipulation of inertial dynamics and aerodynamics by enforcing nonholonomic constraints onto the system. The proposed design paradigm assumes for rapidly exponentially stable controllers that enforce holonomic constraints in the joint space of the model.

Allice is capable of adjusting the position of its Center of Gravity (CG) with respect to the Center of Pressure (CP) using a nonlinear closed-loop feedback. This nonlinear control law, which is based on the method of input-output feedback linearization, enables attitude regulations through variations in CG-CP distance.

However, B2's periodic flapping and its complex aerodynamics present major challenges in modeling and planning feasible flight paths. In this paper, we present a generalized approach that uses a model with direct collocation methods to plan dynamically feasible flight maneuvers. The model is made to be both accurate through collection of load cell force data for parameter selection and computationally inexpensive such that it can be used efficiently in a nonlinear solver. We compute the trajectory of launching B2 to a desired altitude and a banked turn maneuver, and we validate our methods with experimental flight results of tracking the launch trajectory with a PD controller.},

Our approach is motivated by recent studies on biological bat flight that have shown that the salient aspects of wing motion can be accurately represented in a low-dimensional space. Although bats have over 40 degrees of freedom (DoFs), our robot possesses several biologically meaningful morphing specializations. We use principal component analysis (PCA) to characterize the two most dominant modes of biological bat flight kinematics, and we optimize our robot’s parametric kinematics to mimic these. The method yields a robot that is reduced from five degrees of actuation (DoAs) to just three, and that actively folds its wings within a wingbeat period.

We have created a fully self-contained, autonomous flying robot that weighs 93 grams, called Bat Bot (B2), to mimic such morphological properties of bat wings. Instead of using a large number of distributed control actuators, we implement highly stretchable silicone-based membrane wings that are controlled at a reduced number of dominant wing joints to best match the morphological characteristics of bat flight. First, the dominant degrees of freedom (DOFs) in the bat flight mechanism are identified and incorporated in B2’s design by means of a series of mechanical constraints. These biologically meaningful DOFs include asynchronous and mediolateral movements of the armwings and dorsoventral movements of the legs. Second, the continuous surface and elastic properties of bat skin under wing morphing are realized by an ultrathin (56 micrometers) membranous skin that covers the skeleton of the morphing wings. We have successfully achieved autonomous flight of B2 using a series of virtual constraints to control the articulated, morphing wings.},

This robot has only five actuators but retains the ability to flap and fold-unfold its wings in flight. However, this bat-like robot has been unable to perform folding-unfolding of its wings within the period of a wingbeat cycle, about 100 ms. The DC motors operating the spindle mechanisms cannot attain this folding speed. Biological bats rely on this periodic folding of their wings during the upstroke of the wingbeat cycle. It reduces the moment of inertia of the wings and limits the negative lift generated during the upstroke. Thus, we consider it important to achieve wing folding during the upstroke. A mechanism was designed to couple the flapping cycle to the folding cycle of the robot. We then use biological data to further optimize the mechanism such that the kinematic synergies of the robot best match those of a biological bat. This ensures that folding is performed at the correct point in the wingbeat cycle.},

In recent work, a bat inspired soft Micro Aerial Vehicle (MAV) called Bat Bot (B2) with ﬁve Degrees of Actuation (DoA) has been constructed to mimic the ﬂight behavior of a biological bat. Major differences in structural topology resulted from this simpler kinematic complexity, and thus it is necessary to ﬁnd the dimensions of B2’s structure and the behavior of its actuators such that the wingbeat cycle of B2 closely mimics that of a biological bat. The current work assumes the previously designed structure of B2 and presents a synergistic design approach to imitate the kinematic synergies of a biological bat. Recent ﬁndings have unveiled that the most dominant synergies in a biological bat could be combined to accurately represent the original kinematic movement, therefore simplifying its dimensional complexity. In this work, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) has been employed in order to extract dominant principal components of biological bat ﬂight kinematics. Thereafter, ﬁrst and second principal components are chosen to shape the parametric kinematics and actuator trajectories of B2 through ﬁnite state nonlinear constrained optimization. The method yields a robot mechanism that despite having a few DoAs, it possesses several biologically meaningful morphing specializations.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a systematic flight controller design based on the mathematics of parametrized manifolds and calculus of variations for the Bat Bot (B2), which possesses many articulated wings. Wing kinematics and morphological properties are crucial in the powered flight of flying vertebrates. The articulated skeleton of these mammals, which contains many degrees of actuation and underactuation, has made it difficult to understand the connection between the bat's flight dynamics and its intricate array of physiological and morphological specializations. B2 is a biomimetic micro aerial vehicle (MAV) that possesses similar morphological properties to a bat in order to duplicate bats powered ballistic motion. In an effort to design the advanced flight control algorithm for B2, this paper reports two major contributions. First, a systematic mathematical framework is introduced that evaluates the holonomically-constrained Lagrangian model of a flapping robot with specified active and passive degrees of freedom (DoF) in order to locate physically feasible and biologically meaningful periodic solutions using optimization. These are parametrized constraint manifolds; the flapping wing dynamics are governed by these manifolds. Second, calculus of variations and the well-recognized method of inverse dynamics are applied in order to synthesize the flight control algorithm for the flapping wings.},

	abstract = {This paper reports on an underactuated 3D bipedal robot with passive feet that can start from a quiet standing position, initiate a walking gait, and traverse the length of the laboratory (approximately 10 m) at a speed of roughly 1 m/s. The controller was developed using the method of virtual constraints, a control design method first used on the planar point-feet robots Rabbit and MABEL. For the preliminary experiments reported here, virtual constraints were experimentally tuned to achieve robust planar walking and then 3D walking. A key feature of the controller leading to successful 3D walking is the particular choice of virtual constraints in the lateral plane, which implement a lateral balance control strategy similar to SIMBICON. To our knowledge, MARLO is the most highly underactuated bipedal robot to walk unassisted in 3D.},

	abstract = {This work develops feedback controllers for bipedal walking in 3D on level ground, both in simulation and experimentally.  MARLO is a new robot that has been designed for the study of 3D-bipedal locomotion, with the aim of combining energy efficiency, speed, and robustness with respect to natural terrain variations in a single platform. The robot is highly underactuated, having six actuators and, in single support, 13 degrees of freedom. Its sagittal plane dynamics are designed to embody the spring loaded inverted pendulum (SLIP), which has been shown to provide a dynamic model of the body center of mass during steady running gaits in a wide diversity of terrestrial animals. A detailed dynamic model is used to optimize walking gaits with respect to the cost of mechanical transport (cmt), a dimensionless measure of energetic efficiency.
A feedback controller is designed that balances the robot during the quiet standing mode, and another feedback policy is developed such that the robot can take a transition step from quiet standing to walking. A feedback controller is designed that stabilizes steady-state 3D walking gaits, despite the high degree of underactuation of the robot. These controllers are combined through a state machine that handles switching among the three controllers controllers. In experiments on planarized (2D) and untethered (3D)  versions of the robot with point feet and passive feet (prosthetic feet) walking over flat ground or on a ramp with a shallow slope, the adaptability of the designed controller to the environment (planar or untethered, flat ground or ramp), and to the morphology of the robot (point feet or passive feet), is demonstrated. In experiments on a planarized version of the robot with passive feet, the controller yielded stable walking after starting from quiet standing, autonomously and without any intervention from the operator. In experiments on an untethered (3D) version of the robot, the controller was able to balance the robot over flat ground or on a shallow ramp during the quiet standing mode. In addition, the controller yielded six-untethered ``human-like'' steps after starting from quiet standing, autonomously without any intervention from the operator.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a feedback controller that allows MABEL, which is a kneed planar bipedal robot with 1-m-long legs, to accommodate terrain that presents large unexpected increases and decreases in height. The robot is provided no information regarding where the change in terrain height occurs and by how much. A finite-state machine is designed that manages transitions among controllers for flat-ground walking, stepping-up and -down, and a trip reflex. If the robot completes a step, the depth of a step-down or the height of a step-up can be immediately estimated at impact from the lengths of the legs and the angles of the robot’s joints. The change in height can be used to invoke a proper control response. On the other hand, if the swing leg impacts an obstacle during a step, or has a premature impact with the ground, a trip reflex is triggered on the basis of specially designed contact switches on the robot’s shins, contact switches at the end of each leg, and the current configuration of the robot. The design of each control mode and the transition conditions among them are presented. This paper concludes with experimental results of MABEL (blindly) accommodating various types of platforms, including ascent of a 12.5-cm-high platform, stepping-off an 18.5-cm-high platform, and walking over a platform with multiple ascending and descending steps.},

The robot is provided information on neither where the step down occurs, nor by how much. After the robot has stepped off a raised platform, however, the height of the platform can be estimated from the lengths of the legs and the angles of the robot's joints. A real-time control strategy is implemented that uses this on-line estimate of step-down height to switch from a baseline controller, that is designed for flat-ground walking, to a second controller, that is designed to attenuate torso oscillation resulting from the step-down disturbance. After one step, the baseline controller is re-applied. The control strategy is developed on a simplified-design model of the robot and then verified on a more realistic model before being evaluated experimentally. The paper concludes with experimental results showing MABEL (blindly) stepping off a 20 cm high platform.},
