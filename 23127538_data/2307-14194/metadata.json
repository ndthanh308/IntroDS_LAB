  "abstract": "We study breaking properties of a solid neutron star crust. We consider the case in which the crust at any fixed density consists of two types ions, forming a strongly ordered Coulomb crystal. It is shown that the breaking stress of a such matter noticeably depends on ionic composition, and it is typically larger than for a one-component crystal. The difference may reach a factor of several.",
