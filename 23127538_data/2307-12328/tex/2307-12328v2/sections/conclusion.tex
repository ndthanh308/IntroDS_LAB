\section{Conclusion}
This paper presents the first systematic empirical study on how real-world iOS apps exploit DL techniques.
We first explore the current characteristics of on-device models on iOS.
We find that some apps adopt different DL techniques across Android and iOS.
So, we further investigate why developers use different models between Android and iOS.
We propose a new approach to attack gray-box on-device models of Core ML on iOS, and the results illustrate the effectiveness of our approach.
Our future work will focus on how to attack gray-box on-device models without white-box counterparts and how to dynamically analyze on-device models when apps are running.
