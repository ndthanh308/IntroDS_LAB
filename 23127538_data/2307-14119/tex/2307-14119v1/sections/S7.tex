In this paper, we have proposed a general CV/NLP/KR  methodology for producing high quality image datasets. The motivation for this work lies in the need of overcoming some of the limitations which exist in the current annotation process. 
This is only a first step. We believe in fact that the use of NLP/KR techniques, as the main mechanism for labeling examples, is the key to the development of explainable and high performance ML systems. %\cite{2019gini}.
