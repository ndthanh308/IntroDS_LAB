  "abstract": "We introduce a pseudo-spin model for the argentophilic bond expected in silver-based bilayered materials arising from a spontaneous pseudo-magnetic field interacting with pseudo-spins of two unconventional Ag ions, namely $\\rm Ag^{2+}$ and $\\rm Ag^{1-}$ electronically distinct from (albeit energetically degenerate to) the conventional $\\rm Ag^{1+}$ cation typically observed in monolayered materials. This model suggests the possibility of tuning the dimensionality and hence the conductor-semiconductor-insulator properties of honeycomb bilayered materials by application of external fields, analogous to driving a superconducting or Coulomb blockade system to the normal regime by critical magnetic or electric fields respectively.",
