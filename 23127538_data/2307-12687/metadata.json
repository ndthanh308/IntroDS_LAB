  "abstract": "Machine learning methods have been widely used in the investigations of the complex plasmas. In this paper, we demonstrate that the unsupervised convolutional neural network can be applied to obtain the melting line in the two-dimensional complex plasmas based on the Langevin dynamics simulation results. The training samples do not need to be labeled. The resulting melting line coincides with those obtained by the analysis of hexatic order parameter and supervised machine learning method.",
