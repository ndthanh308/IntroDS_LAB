\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}
In this paper, we propose a fast leakage and variability-aware thermal simulation method that also captures the temperature dependence of conductivity. We derive a closed-form of the Green's function considering all these effects using novel insights and algebraic techniques. Our approach provides fast and accurate solutions for both the steady-state and the transient thermal profile and has been validated with a wide variety of test cases. As device dimensions continue to shrink, process variation has become a serious problem. The methods proposed in this work can equip designers to tackle this problem and may spawn further research in this area.
