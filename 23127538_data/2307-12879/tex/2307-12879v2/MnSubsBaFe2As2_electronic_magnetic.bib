	abstract = {Superconductivity has recently been discovered in several families of iron-based compounds, but despite intense research even such basic electronic properties of these materials as Fermi surfaces, effective electron masses and orbital characters are still subject to debate. Here, we address an issue that has not been considered before, namely the consequences of dynamical screening of the Coulomb interactions between Fe d~electrons. We demonstrate that dynamical screening effects are important not only for higher-energy spectral features, such as correlation satellites seen in photoemission spectroscopy, but also for the low-energy electronic structure. Our analysis indicates that BaFe2As2 is a strongly correlated compound with strongly doping- and temperature-dependent properties. In the hole-overdoped regime an incoherent metal is found, whereas Fermi-liquid behaviour is recovered in the undoped compound. At optimal doping, the self-energy exhibits an unusual square-root energy dependence, which leads to strong band renormalizations near the Fermi level.},

These measurements show that the superconducting transition temperature decreases monotonically and is finally suppressed below 1.8 K as x is increased from 0 to 0.036. For x values greater than 0.016, signatures of a magnetic transition can be detected in both thermodynamic and transport measurements in which kinklike features allow for the determination of the transition temperature T* that increases as Mn substitution increases. A temperature-composition (T-x) phase diagram is constructed, revealing a half-dome of superconductivity with the magnetic transition temperature T* appearing near 26 K for x\~{}0.017 and rising slowly up to 33 K for x\~{}0.036. In addition to the creation of the T-x phase diagram for CaK(Fe1-xMnx)4As4, specific-heat data are used to track the jump in specific heat at Tc; the CaK(Fe1-xMnx)4As4 data do not follow the scaling of $\Delta$Cp with T3c as many of the other Fe-based superconducting systems do. These data suggest that, as magnetic pair breaking is present, the jump in Cp for a given Tc is reduced. Elastoresistivity coefficients 2m66 and m11-m12 as a function of temperature are also measured. 2m66 and m11-m12 are qualitatively similar to CaK(Fe1-xNix)4As4. This may indicate that the magnetic order in Mn-substituted system may be still the same as CaK(Fe1-xNix)4As4. Superconductivity of CaK(Fe1-xMnx)4As4 is also studied as a function of magnetic field. A clear change in H'c2(T)/Tc, where H'c2(T) is dHc2(T)/dT, at x\~{}0.015 is observed and probably is related to change of the Fermi surface due to magnetic order. Coherence lengths and the London penetration depths are also calculated based on Hc1 and Hc2 data. Coherence lengths as the function of x also show the changes near x=0.015, again consistent with Fermi-surface changes associated with the magnetic ordering seen for higher-x values.},

	abstract = {A carrier doping by a hydrogen substitution in LaFeAsO1-x H x is known to cause two superconducting (SC) domes with the magnetic order at both end sides of the doping. In contrast, SmFeAsO1-x H x has a similar phase diagram but shows single SC dome. Here, we investigated the electronic and crystal structures for iron oxynitride LnFeAsO1-x H x (Ln = La, Sm) with the range of x = 0{\textendash}0.5 by using x-ray absorption spectroscopy, x-ray emission spectroscopy, and x-ray diffraction. For both compounds, we observed that the pre-edge peaks of x-ray absorption spectra near the Fe-K edge were reduced in intensity on doping. The character arises from the weaker As{\textendash}Fe hybridization with the longer As{\textendash}Fe distance in the higher doped region. We can reproduce the spectra near the Fe-K edge according to the Anderson impurity model with realistic valence structures using the local-density approximation (LDA) plus dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT). For Ln = Sm, the integrated-absolute difference (IAD) analysis from x-ray Fe-K$\beta$ emission spectra increases significantly. This is attributed to the enhancement of magnetic moment of Fe 3d electrons stemming from the localized picture in the higher doped region. A theoretical simulation implementing the self-consistent vertex-correction method reveals that the single dome superconducting phase for Ln = Sm arises from a better nesting condition in comparison with Ln = La.},

These measurements examine the effect of Cr doping on the high-temperature tetragonal (I4/mmm) to low-temperature orthorhombic (Fmmm) structural phase transition of the parent compound BaFe2As2. Increasing Cr concentration is found to suppress the structural transition temperature (T-s) and reduce the magnitude of the orthorhombic strain (delta). The doping dependence of the orthorhombic strain, combined with complementary measurements of the high-temperature magnetic susceptibility, suggests the presence of a magnetostructural crossover at x similar to 0.05. In particular, this crossover appears to mark a shift from strong to weak orthorhombicity and from predominantly itinerant to localized magnetic behavior.},

We show that before long-range Néel order sets in, the coupling between the conduction electrons and the fluctuations of the local moments favors an unusual magnetic state consisting of a coherent superposition of the (π,0) and (0,π) orders that preserves tetragonal symmetry. The magnetization of this state is nonuniform and induces a simultaneous checkerboard charge order. We discuss signatures of this magnetic configuration on the electronic spectrum and its impact on the superconducting state, showing that its phase space for coexistence with the s+− state is smaller than the stripe-type state. Our results shed light on recent experimental observations on Ba(Fe1−xMnx)2As2 compounds, where the Néel-type local Mn moments interact with the Fe conduction electrons.},

In the weak correlation regime and rather small doping, the Anderson-Mott insulator displays properties which are similar to the ones found at half filling. In particular, this phase is characterized by the presence of empty sites. If we further increase either the doping or the correlation, however, an Anderson-Mott phase of a different kind arises for sharply weaker disorder strength.

Our results show that upon increasing pressure, the magnetic transition temperature TN is suppressed, whereas the superconducting transition temperature Tc first increases and then decreases, exhibiting a maximum at a pressure pc corresponding to the intersection of the TN(p) and Tc(p) lines. In addition, a minimum in the normalized slope of the superconducting upper critical field as well as a change in the pressure dependence of the inferred superconducting coherence length are observed at pc, suggesting a difference in the Fermi surface of the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic states. Finally, CaK(Fe1−xMnx)4As4 (x=0.024) likely goes through a half-collapsed tetragonal phase transition at ∼4.3 GPa, further demonstrating that the half-collapsed tetragonal transition pressure in the CaKFe4As4 system is relatively insensitive to transition metal substitution.},

In the optimally hole-doped Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2, the pairing strength is enhanced simultaneously (2Δ/Tc≈7) on the nearly nested FS pockets, i.e., the inner hole-like (α) FS and the 2 hybridized electron-like FSs, whereas the pairing remains weak (2Δ/Tc≈3.6) in the poorly nested outer hole-like (β) FS. Here, we report that in the electron-doped BaFe1.85Co0.15As2, the FS nesting condition switches from the α to the β FS due to the opposite size changes for hole- and electron-like FSs upon electron doping. The strong pairing strength (2Δ/Tc≈6) is also found to switch to the nested β FS, indicating an intimate connection between FS nesting and superconducting pairing, and strongly supporting the inter-FS pairing mechanism in the iron-based superconductors.},

	abstract = {The superconducting phase in iron-based high-T-c superconductors (FeSC), as in other unconventional superconductors such as the cuprates, neighbors a magnetically ordered one in the phase diagram. This proximity hints at the importance of electron correlation effects in these materials, and Hund's exchange interaction has been suggested to be the dominant correlation effect in FeSCs because of their multiband nature. By this reasoning, correlation should be strongest for materials closest to a half-filled 3d electron shell (Mn compounds, hole-doped FeSCs) and decrease for systems with both higher (electron-doped FeSCs) and lower (Cr-pnictides) 3d counts. Here we address the strength of correlation effects in nonsuperconducting antiferromagnetic BaCr2As2 by means of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and first-principles calculations. This combination provides us with two handles on the strength of correlation: First, a comparison of the experimental and calculated effective masses yields the correlation-induced mass renormalization. In addition, the lifetime broadening of the experimentally observed dispersions provides another measure of the correlation strength. Both approaches reveal a reduction of electron correlation in BaCr2As2 with respect to systems with a 3d count closer to five. Our results thereby support the theoretical predictions that Hund's exchange interaction is important in these materials.},

In contrast to the behavior in high dimensions, here the local spatial fluctuations of quasiparticle parameters are strongly enhanced in the critical regime, with a distribution function P(Z)∼Zα−1 and α→0 at the transition. This behavior indicates a robust emergence of an electronic Griffiths phase preceding the metal-insulator transition, in a fashion surprisingly reminiscent of the “infinite randomness fixed point” scenario for disordered quantum magnets.},

From first-principles calculations of the configuration-averaged spectral function of BaFe2As2 with disordered Co or Zn substitutions of Fe, important doping effects are found beyond merely changing the carrier density. While the chemical potential shifts suggest doping of a large amount of carriers, a reduction of the coherent carrier density is found due to the loss of spectral weight. Therefore, none of the change in the Fermi surface, density of states, or charge distribution can be solely used for counting doped coherent carriers, let alone presenting the full effects of the disordered substitutions.

Absence of the superconductivity by Mn doping is in sharp contrast to the hole-doped system with K substitution at the Sr sites. First-principles calculations based on detailed structural investigations reveal that a distinct structural change, i.e., the increase in the Fe-As distance by Mn doping is the most decisive factor to induce a magnetic and semiconducting ground state in SrFe2-xMnxAs2. The absence of electron-hole symmetry in the phase diagrams of the Fe-site doped SrFe2As2 suggests that the occurrence of high-Tc superconductivity is sensitive to the structural modification rather than the carrier doping.},

While the SDW transition at x=0, 2.5\%, and 5\% remains equally sharp, in the x=12\% sample we observe an abrupt smearing of the antiferromagnetic transition in temperature and a considerable suppression of the spin gap in the magnetic excitation spectrum. According to our muon-spin-relaxation, nuclear magnetic resonance and neutron-scattering data, antiferromagnetically ordered rare regions start forming in the x=12\% sample significantly above the N{\'e}el temperature of the parent compound. Upon cooling, their volume grows continuously, leading to an increase in the magnetic Bragg intensity and to the gradual opening of a partial spin gap in the magnetic excitation spectrum. Using neutron Larmor diffraction, we also demonstrate that the magnetically ordered volume is characterized by a finite orthorhombic distortion, which could not be resolved in previous diffraction studies most probably due to its coexistence with the tetragonal phase and a microstrain-induced broadening of the Bragg reflections. We argue that Ba(Fe1-xMnx)2As2 could represent an interesting model spin-glass system, in which localized magnetic moments are randomly embedded into a SDW metal with Fermi surface nesting.},

Many theoretical techniques have been applied to individual compounds but no consistent description of the microscopic origin of these variations is available(2). Here we carry out a comparative theoretical study of a large number of iron-based compounds in both their magnetic and paramagnetic states. Taking into account correlation effects and realistic band structures, we describe well the trends in all of the physical properties such as the ordered moments, effective masses and Fermi surfaces across all families of iron compounds, and find them to be in good agreement with experiments. We trace variation in physical properties to variations in the key structural parameters, rather than changes in the screening of the Coulomb interactions.

In the weak coupling limit Z decreases for all correlated d orbitals as a function of U and beyond the crossover coupling they become weakly dependent on U while strongly dependent on J. A marked orbital dependence of the Z's emerges even if in general the orbital-selective Mott transition only occurs for relatively large values of U.

However, contrary to what happens in Mott correlated states the reduction of the quasiparticle weight Z with J(H) can happen in spite of increasing charge fluctuations. Therefore, in Hund metals the quasiparticle weight and the mass enhancement are not good measurements of the charge localization. Using simple energetic arguments we explain why the spin polarization induced by Hund's coupling produces orbital decoupling. We also discuss how the behavior at moderate interactions, with correlations controlled by the atomic spin polarization, changes at large U and J(H) due to the proximity to a Mott insulating state.},

Uncovering the character of the proximate magnetic phase is a crucial step towards understanding the mechanism of superconductivity. Unlike the case in the cuprate superconductors, the nature of the magnetism and its underlying electronic state in the iron pnictide superconductors(3) is still not well understood. Many low-energy probes such as transport(4), scanning tunnelling microscopy(5) and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy(6) have measured strong in-plane anisotropy of the electronic states, but there is no consensus on its physical origin. Using a first-principles theoretical approach, we modelled the magnetic state of the BaFe2As2 parent compound and obtained the magnetic moment, optical conductivity and anisotropy of the electronic states, all in excellent agreement with experiments. We demonstrate that energy-dependent spin and orbital polarizations are essential features of the magnetic state in iron pnictides. Although the spin polarization is enhanced at high energy, the orbital polarization is strong only at low energy. A gain of Hund's coupling energy rather than Hubbard repulsion energy compensates the loss in kinetic energy, thereby stabilizing the low-temperature magnetic phase.},

With decreasing temperature, a transition from the paramagnetic phase to the antiferromagnetic phase was clearly observed by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. XAS results indicated that the substituted Mn atoms form a strongly hybridized ground state. Resonance-photoemission spectra at the Mn L3 edge revealed that the Mn 3d partial density of states is distributed over a wide energy range of 2{\textendash}13 eV below the Fermi level (EF), with little contribution around EF. This indicates that the dopant Mn 3d states are localized in spite of the strong Mn 3d{\textendash}As 4p hybridization and split into the occupied and unoccupied parts due to the on-site Coulomb and exchange interaction. The absence of superconductivity in Ba(Fe1-xMnx)2As2 can thus be ascribed both to the absence of carrier doping in the FeAs plane and to the stabilization of the competing G-type antiferromagnetic order by the Mn impurities.},

The fact that, as in the copper oxide high temperature superconductors, long-range antiferromagnetism in the FeSCs arises in proximity to superconductivity immediately raised the question of the degree of similarity between the two. Despite the great resemblance in their phase diagrams, there exist important differences between the FeSCs and the cuprates that need to be considered in order to paint a full picture of these two families of high temperature superconductors. One of the key differences is the multi-orbital multi-band nature of the FeSCs, which contrasts with the effective single-band nature of the cuprates. Systematic studies of orbital related phenomena in FeSCs have been largely lacking. In this review, we summarize angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements across various FeSC families that have been reported in literature, focusing on the systematic trends of orbital dependent electron correlations and the role of different Fe 3d orbitals in driving the nematic transition, the spin-density-wave transition, and superconductivity.},

It is known that while a small amount of Co substitution lead to SC, the same does not occur for Mn for any value of x. In this work, magnetic excitations in the iron arsenides Ba(Fe1-xMnx)2As2(x=0.0,0.007,0.009,0.08) are investigated by means of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) at the Fe L3 edge, for momentum transfer q along the high symmetry Brillouin zone ($\pi$,0) and ($\pi$,$\pi$) directions. It is shown that with increasing Mn content (x), the excitations become anisotropic both in dispersion and lineshape. Both effects are detected even for small values of x, evidencing a cooperative phenomenon between the Mn impurities, that we ascribe to emerging N{\'e}el order of the Mn spins. Moreover, for x=0.08, the excitations along q||($\pi$,0) are strongly damped and nearly nondispersive. This result suggests that phases of arsenides containing local moments at the FeAs layers, as in Mn or Cr substituted phases, do not support high temperature SC due to the absence of the appropriate magnetic excitations.},

Experiments show that weakly and strongly correlated conduction electrons coexist in much of the phase diagram, a differentiation which increases with hole doping. This selective Mottness is caused by the Hund{\textquoteright}s coupling effect of decoupling the charge excitations in different orbitals. Each orbital then behaves as a single-band doped Mott insulator, where the correlation degree mainly depends on how doped is each orbital from half filling. Our scenario reconciles contrasting evidences on the electronic correlation strength, implies a strong asymmetry between hole and electron doping, and establishes a deep connection with the cuprates.},

Our analysis suggests that the observed phenomenology and the inapplicability of the rigid band model in Co-doped Ba122 are due to electronic correlations, and not to the either the strength of the impurity potential, or self-energy effects due to impurity scattering. Our findings indicate that the effects of doping in pnictides are much more complicated than currently believed. More generally, they indicate that a deep understanding of the evolution of the electronic properties of the normal state, which requires an understanding of the doping process, remains elusive even for the 122 iron-pnictides, which are viewed as the least correlated of the high-TC unconventional superconductors.},

Here, we report a detailed study of the electronic structure of fully detwinned FeSe across the nematic phase transition using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We clearly observe a nematicity-driven band reconstruction involving dxz, dyz, and dxy orbitals. The nematic energy scale between dxz and dyz bands reaches a maximum of 50 meV at the Brillouin zone corner. We are also able to track the dxz electron pocket across the nematic transition and explain its absence in the nematic state.

In both spin- and orbital-nematic models, the intrinsic magnetic excitations at Q1 = (1, 0) and Q2 = (0, 1) of twin-free FeSe are expected to provide decisive criteria for clarifying this issue. Although a spin-fluctuation anisotropy below 10 meV between Q1 and Q2 has been observed by inelastic neutron scattering at low temperature, it remains unclear whether such an anisotropy also persists at higher energies and associates with the nematic transition Ts. Here we use resonant inelastic X-ray scattering to probe the high-energy magnetic excitations of detwinned FeSe. A prominent anisotropy between the magnetic excitations along the H and K directions is found to persist to E ? 200 meV, which decreases gradually with increasing temperature and finally vanishes at a temperature around Ts. The measured high-energy spin excitations are dispersive and underdamped, which can be understood from a local-moment perspective.Taking together the large energy scale far beyond the dxz/dyz orbital splitting, we suggest that the nematicity in FeSe is probably spin-driven.},

In contrast to BaFe2As2, where only Fe spins order, EuFe2As2 has an additional magnetic transition below 20 K due to the ordering of the Eu2+ spins (J=7/2, with L=0 and S=7/2) in an A-type antiferromagnetic texture (ferromagnetic layers stacked antiferromagnetically). This may potentially affect the FeAs layer and its local and correlated magnetism. FeK$\beta$ x-ray emission experiments on EuFe2As2 single crystals reveal a local magnetic moment of 1.3{\textpm}0.15$\mu$B at 15 K that increases slightly to 1.45{\textpm}0.15$\mu$B at 300 K. Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering experiments performed on the same crystals show dispersive broad (in energy) magnetic excitations along (0,0){\textrightarrow}(1,0) and (0,0){\textrightarrow}(1,1) with a bandwidth on the order of 170{\textendash}180 meV. These results on local and collective magnetism are in line with other parent compounds of the AFe2As2 series (A=Ba, Ca, and Sr), especially the well-characterized BaFe2As2. Thus, our experiments lead us to the conclusion that the effect of the high magnetic moment of Eu on the magnitude of both the Fe local magnetic moment and spin excitations is small and confined to low-energy excitations.},

For these undoped materials, it is well established that the spin-excitation spectrum consists of sharp, highly dispersive magnons. The fate of these high-energy magnetic modes upon sizable doping with holes is hitherto unresolved. Here we demonstrate, using resonant inelastic X-ray scattering, that optimally hole-doped superconducting Ba0.6K0.4Fe2As2 retains well-defined, dispersive high-energy modes of magnetic origin. These paramagnon modes are softer than, though as intense as, the magnons of undoped antiferromagnetic BaFe2As2. The persistence of spin excitations well into the superconducting phase suggests that the spin fluctuations in Fe-pnictide superconductors originate from a distinctly correlated spin state. This connects Fe pnictides to cuprates, for which, in spite of fundamental electronic structure differences, similar paramagnons are present.},

The presence of both Hubbard repulsion and Hund's coupling leads to rich physics in these multiorbital systems, and motivated descriptions of magnetism in terms of itinerant electrons or localized spins. The NaFe1-xCuxAs series consists of magnetically ordered bad metal (x=0), superconducting (x?0.02) and magnetically ordered semiconducing/insulating (x?0.5) phases, providing a platform to investigate the connection between superconductivity, magnetism and electronic correlations. Here we use x-ray absorption spectroscopy and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering to study the valence state of Fe and spin dynamics in two NaFe1-xCuxAs compounds (x=0 and 0.47). We find that magnetism in both compounds arises from Fe2+ atoms, and exhibits underdamped dispersive spin waves in their respective ordered states. The dispersion of spin excitations in NaFe0.53Cu0.47As is consistent with being quasi-one-dimensional. Compared to NaFeAs, the band top of spin waves in NaFe0.53Cu0.47As is slightly softened with significantly more spectral weight of the spin excitations. Our results indicate the spin dynamics in NaFe0.53Cu0.47As arise from localized magnetic moments and suggest the iron-based superconductors are proximate to a correlated insulating state with localized iron moments.},

	abstract = {The iron-based superconductors are characterized by multiple-orbital physics where all the five Fe 3d orbitals get involved. The multiple-orbital nature gives rise to various novel phenomena like orbital-selective Mott transition, nematicity, and orbital fluctuation that provide a new route for realizing superconductivity. The complexity of multiple-orbital physics also requires us to disentangle the relationship between orbital, spin, and nematicity, and to identify dominant orbital ingredients that dictate superconductivity. The bulk FeSe superconductor provides an ideal platform to address these issues because of its simple crystal structure and unique coexistence of superconductivity and nematicity. However, the orbital nature of the low-energy electronic excitations and its relation to the superconducting gap remain controversial. Here, we report direct observation of the highly anisotropic Fermi surface and extremely anisotropic superconducting gap in the nematic state of the FeSe superconductor by high-resolution laser-based angle-resolved photoemission measurements. We find that the low-energy excitations of the entire hole pocket at the Brillouin zone center are dominated by the single dxz orbital. The superconducting gap exhibits an anticorrelation relation with the dxz spectral weight near the Fermi level; i.e., the gap size minimum (maximum) corresponds to the maximum (minimum) of the dxz spectral weight along the Fermi surface. These observations provide new insights in understanding the orbital origin of the extremely anisotropic superconducting gap in the FeSe superconductor and the relation between nematicity and superconductivity in the iron-based superconductors.},

	abstract = {Nematicity, defined as broken rotational symmetry, has recently been observed in competing phases proximate to the superconducting phase in the cuprate high-temperature superconductors. Similarly, the new iron-based high-temperature superconductors exhibit a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition (i.e., a broken C4 symmetry) that either precedes or is coincident with a collinear spin density wave (SDW) transition in undoped parent compounds, and superconductivity arises when both transitions are suppressed via doping. Evidence for strong in-plane anisotropy in the SDW state in this family of compounds has been reported by neutron scattering, scanning tunneling microscopy, and transport measurements. Here, we present an angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy study of detwinned single crystals of a representative family of electron-doped iron-arsenide superconductors, Ba(Fe1-xCox)2As2 in the underdoped region. The crystals were detwinned via application of in-plane uniaxial stress, enabling measurements of single domain electronic structure in the orthorhombic state. At low temperatures, our results clearly demonstrate an in-plane electronic anisotropy characterized by a large energy splitting of two orthogonal bands with dominant dxz and dyz character, which is consistent with anisotropy observed by other probes. For compositions x {\textbackslash}textgreater 0, for which the structural transition (TS) precedes the magnetic transition (TSDW), an anisotropic splitting is observed to develop above TSDW, indicating that it is specifically associated with TS. For unstressed crystals, the band splitting is observed close to TS, whereas for stressed crystals, the splitting is observed to considerably higher temperatures, revealing the presence of a surprisingly large in-plane nematic susceptibility in the electronic structure.},

Superconductivity emerges for Co concentrations above x\~{}0.025 and appears to coexist with the broken-symmetry state for an appreciable range of doping up to x\~{}0.06. The optimal superconducting transition temperature appears to coincide with the Co concentration at which the magnetic/structural phase transitions are totally suppressed, at least within the resolution provided by the finite-step size between crystals prepared with different doping levels. Superconductivity is observed for a further range of Co concentrations before being completely suppressed for x\~{}0.18 and above.

For Hund{\textquoteright}s couplings beyond a threshold value, this occurs via an intermediate orbital-selective Mott phase, in which the 3d xy orbital is Mott localized while the other 3d orbitals remain itinerant. This phase is still stabilized over a range of carrier dopings.

However, they do not all have the same status for an ARPES experiment. There are interference effects between the 2 Fe that modulate strongly the intensity of the bands and that can even switch their parity. We give a simple description of these effects, notably showing that ARPES polarization selection rules in these systems can not be applied by reference to a single Fe ion. We show that ARPES data for the electron pockets in Ba(Fe0.92Co0.08)2As2 are in excellent agreement with this model as well as with direct calculation of the spectral weight. We observe both the total suppression of some bands and the parity switching of some other bands. Once these effects are properly taken into account, the structure of the electron pockets, as measured by ARPES, becomes very clear and simple. By combining ARPES measurements in different experimental configurations, we clearly isolate each band forming one of the electron pockets. We identify a deep electron band along one ellipse axis with the dxy orbital and a shallow electron band along the perpendicular axis with the dxz/dyz orbitals, in good agreement with band-structure calculations. We show that the electron pockets are warped as a function of kz as expected theoretically, but that they are much smaller than predicted by the calculation.},

Moreover, we found that the electronic correlation could be suppressed by applying either the chemical pressure or doping electrons but not by doping holes.

The electron and hole doping causes slight increase of the integrated absolute difference (IAD) values of the Fe K beta x-ray emission spectra which correlate to the local magnetic moment. Pressure decreases the IAD values and local magnetic moment, and induces the lower-spin states in these compounds. The pre-edge peak intensity of the XAS spectra at the Fe K-absorption edge increases with pressure in both compounds. This indicates an increase of the Fe 3d-As 4p hybridization. It was found that pressure induced a discontinuous increase of the prepeak intensity of the PFY-XAS spectra at the AsK-absorption edge at low pressures in the BaFe2As2 systems. Our results may suggest that the Fe 3d-As 4p hybridization plays a key role in suppressing the AFM order by the doping or pressure and fluctuation of the local magnetic moment and the electron-electron correlation may also play a role on the physical properties of the iron superconductors.},

From first-principles calculations of the configuration-averaged spectral function of BaFe2As2 with disordered Co or Zn substitutions of Fe, important doping effects are found beyond merely changing the carrier density. While the chemical potential shifts suggest doping of a large amount of carriers, a reduction of the coherent carrier density is found due to the loss of spectral weight. Therefore, none of the change in the Fermi surface, density of states, or charge distribution can be solely used for counting doped coherent carriers, let alone presenting the full effects of the disordered substitutions. Our study highlights the necessity of including disorder effects in the studies of doped materials in general.},

The issues of which of these can be considered the leading instability, and whether weak- or strong-coupling approaches are applicable, are both critical and contentious. Here, we revisit the electronic structure of BaFe2As2 using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Our high-resolution measurements of samples {\textquotedblleft}detwinned{\textquotedblright} by the application of a mechanical strain reveal a highly anisotropic 3D Fermi surface in the low-temperature antiferromagnetic phase. By comparison of the observed dispersions with ab initio calculations, we argue that overall it is magnetism, rather than orbital/nematic ordering, which is the dominant effect, reconstructing the electronic structure across the Fe 3d bandwidth. Finally, using a state-of-the-art nano-ARPES system, we reveal how the observed electronic dispersions vary in real space as the beam spot crosses domain boundaries in an unstrained sample, enabling the measurement of ARPES data from within single antiferromagnetic domains, and showing consistence with the effective mono-domain samples obtained by detwinning.},

The ubiquity of such conventional superconductors, and the wide range of associated critical temperatures, is readily understood in terms of the well-known Bardeen{\textendash}Cooper{\textendash}Schrieffer theory. Occasionally, however, unconventional superconductors are found, such as the iron-based materials, which extend and defy this understanding in unexpected ways. In the case of the iron-based superconductors, this includes the different ways in which the presence of multiple atomic orbitals can manifest in unconventional superconductivity, giving rise to a rich landscape of gap structures that share the same dominant pairing mechanism. In addition, these materials have also led to insights into the unusual metallic state governed by the Hund{\textquoteright}s interaction, the control and mechanisms of electronic nematicity, the impact of magnetic fluctuations and quantum criticality, and the importance of topology in correlated states. Over the fourteen years since their discovery, iron-based superconductors have proven to be a testing ground for the development of~novel experimental tools and theoretical approaches, both of which have extensively influenced the wider field of quantum materials.},

In this paper, we present Fe and As K-edge experiments of Ba(Fe1-xMx)2As2 (M=Mn, Co, and x=0.0 and 0.08). The experiments reveal a strong polarization dependence of the probed XANES spectra, which concerns mainly an increase in the intensity of electronic transitions when the beam polarization is set out of the sample's ab crystallographic plane. The results show that states with pz-orbital character dominate the density of unoccupied states close to the Fermi level. Partial substitution of Fe by Co is shown to decrease the intensity anisotropy, suggesting that Co promotes electronic transfer preferentially to states with pz-orbital character. On the other hand, Mn substitution causes the increase in the spectra pz-orbital anisotropy, which is proposed to take place by means of an enhanced local Fe3d4p mixing, unveiling the role of Fe4p states in the localization of the Fe3d orbitals. Moreover, by comparing our results to previous experiments, we identify the relative mixing between Fe and pnictide 4px,y,z orbitals as a clear divide between the electronic properties of iron arsenides and selenides.

The ordered moment $\mu$=3.88(4)$\mu$B/Mn at T=10 K is oriented along the c axis and the magnetic structure is G type, with all nearest-neighbor Mn moments antiferromagnetically aligned. The value of the ordered moment indicates that the oxidation state of Mn is Mn2+ with a high spin S=5/2. The T dependence of $\mu$ suggests that the magnetic transition is second order in nature.

From structural relaxation, we reveal that antiferromagnetic (A-AFM) state is more appropriate for BaMn2As2 than other known configurations.

Further, the decrease in electrical conductivity over the entire temperature range characterize the metallic nature of BaMn2As2.

Here, we report a comprehensive study on the magnetic arsenides BaCr2As2 and BaCrFeAs2 (space group I4/mmm), which are possible mother compounds with d4 and d5 electron configurations, respectively. DFT-based calculations of the electronic structure evidence metallic antiferromagnetic ground states for both compounds. By powder neutron diffraction, we confirm for BaCr2As2 a robust ordering in the antiferromagnetic G-type structure at TN=580 K with $\mu$Cr=1.9$\mu$B. Anomalies in the lattice parameters point to magnetostructural coupling effects. In BaCrFeAs2, the Cr and Fe atoms randomly occupy the transition-metal site and G-type order is found below 265 K with $\mu$Cr/Fe=1.1$\mu$B. 57Fe M{\"o}ssbauer spectroscopy demonstrates that only a small ordered moment is associated with the Fe atoms, in agreement with electronic structure calculations leading to $\mu$Fe\~{}0. The temperature dependence of the hyperfine field does not follow that of the total moments. Both compounds are metallic but show large enhancements of the linear specific heat. Electrical transport in BaCrFeAs2 is dominated by the atomic disorder and the partial magnetic disorder of Fe. Our results indicate that N{\'e}el-type order is unfavorable for Fe moments and thus it is destabilized with increasing Fe content.},

The metal-insulator transition causes only a small suppression of the N{\'e}el temperature (TN) and the ordered moment, suggesting that doped holes interact weakly with the Mn spin system. Powder inelastic neutron scattering measurements were performed on three different samples of Ba1-xKxMn2As2 with x=0, 0.125, and 0.25 to study the effect of hole doping and metallization on the spin dynamics. We compare the neutron intensities to a linear spin-wave theory approximation to the J1-J2-Jc Heisenberg model. Hole doping is found to introduce only minor modifications to the exchange energies and spin gap. The changes observed in the exchange constants are consistent with the small drop of TN with doping.},

	abstract = {High-transition temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity in the iron pnictides or chalcogenides emerges from the suppression of the static antiferromagnetic order in their parent compounds, similar to copper oxide superconductors. This raises a fundamental question concerning the role of magnetism in the superconductivity of these materials. Neutron scattering, a powerful probe to study the magnetic order and spin dynamics, plays an essential role in determining the relationship between magnetism and superconductivity in high-Tc superconductors. The rapid development of modern neutron time-of-flight spectrometers allows a direct determination of the spin dynamical properties of iron-based superconductors throughout the entire Brillouin zone. In this paper, an overview is presented of the neutron scattering results on iron-based superconductors, focusing on the evolution of spin-excitation spectra as a function of electron and hole doping and isoelectronic substitution. Spin dynamical properties of iron-based superconductors are compared with those of copper oxide and heavy fermion superconductors and the common features of spin excitations in these three families of unconventional superconductors and their relationship with superconductivity are discussed.},

	abstract = {To elucidate the role played by the transition-metal ion in the pnictide materials, we compare the electronic and magnetic properties of BaFe2As2 with BaMn2As2. To this end we employ the LDA + Gutzwiller method to analyze the mass renormalizations and the size of the ordered magnetic moment of the two systems. We study a model that contains all five transition-metal 3d orbitals together with the Ba 5d and As 4p states (ddp-model) and compare these results with a downfolded model that consists of Fe/Mn d states only (d-model). Electronic correlations are treated using the multiband Gutzwiller approximation. The paramagnetic phase has also been investigated using the LDA + Gutzwiller method with electron density self-consistency. The renormalization factors for the correlated Mn 3d orbitals in the paramagnetic phase of BaMn2As2 are shown to be generally smaller than those of BaFe2As2, which indicates that BaMn2As2 has stronger electron correlation effect than BaFe2As2. The screening effect of the main As 4p electrons to the correlated Fe/Mn 3d electrons is evident by the systematic shift of the results to the larger Hund's rule coupling J side from the ddp-model compared with those from the d-model. A gradual transition from paramagnetic state to the antiferromagnetic ground state with increasing J is obtained for the models of BaFe2As2 which has a small experimental magnetic moment, while a rather sharp jump occurs for the models of BaMn2As2, which has a large experimental magnetic moment. The key difference between the two systems is shown to be the d-level occupation. BaMn2As2, with approximately five d electrons per Mn atom, is for the same values of the electron correlations closer to the transition to a Mott insulating state than BaFe2As2. Here an orbitally selective Mott transition, required for a system with close to six electrons, only occurs at significantly larger values for the Coulomb interactions.},

Evidently reflecting these disparities, we have discovered a large miscibility gap in the system Ba(MnxFe1-x)2As2. Rietveld refinements of powder x-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements on samples slow-cooled from 1000 oC to room temperature (RT) reveal a two-phase mixture of BaMn2As2 and Ba(Mn0.12Fe0.88)2As2 phases together with impurity phases for x=0.2, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, and 0.8. We infer that there exists a miscibility gap in this system at 300 K with composition limits 0.12?x?1. For samples quenched from 1000 oC to 77 K, the refinements of RT XRD data indicate that the miscibility gap at RT narrows at 1000 oC to 0.2?x?0.8. Samples with x=0.4, 0.5, and 0.6 quenched from 1100 to 1400 oC to 77 K contain a single 122-type phase together with significant amounts of Fe1-xMnxAs and FeAs2 impurity phases. These results indicate that the system is not a pseudobinary system over the whole composition range and that the 122-type phase has a significant homogeneity range at these temperatures. Magnetic susceptibility $\chi$, electrical resistivity $\rho$, and heat capacity measurements versus temperature T of the single-phase quenched polycrystalline samples with x=0.2 and 0.8 are reported. We also report attempts to grow single crystals of the substituted compounds Ba(Mn1-xTx)2As2 (T = Cr, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Ru, Rh, Pd, Re, and Pt) and BaMn2(As1-xSbx)2 out of Sn flux. Energy-dispersive x-ray analyses show that most of these elements do not substitute into the lattice in amounts greater than 0.5\%.

The unusual magnetic splitting spectra at lower temperatures have been analyzed using the distribution of hyperfine field. It is found that the influence of Mn dopant spreads beyond the nearest Fe magnetic moments, and the Fe 3d electrons behave more localized compared with those in the electron-doped compounds. This reduces the hyperfine interactions between iron nucleus and the sounding electrons. The shape of the spin density wave is near-rectangular at 6.4\%-Mn doping, indicating quite different interband interactions compared with electron-doped compounds. A distinct broadening of the spectral linewidth around the spin density wave transition temperature has been observed and the spin correlation time is deduced according to the linewidth. The correlation time is further related to the spin{\textendash}lattice relaxation rate by a simple model and the magnetic fluctuations can be explored effectively. It is found that the magnetic fluctuations of iron spins in Mn-doped compounds can be described well using a phenomenological two-component model and the resulting Curie{\textendash}Weiss temperature is far from the quantum critical point at the present doping levels.},

Using different experimental geometries, we resolve the full elliptic shape of the electron pockets, including parts with dxy symmetry along its major axis that are usually missing. This allows us to precisely define how the hole and electron pockets are nested and how the different orbitals evolve at the transition. We conclude that the imperfect nesting between hole and electron pockets explains rather well the formation of gaps and residual metallic droplets in the AFM phase, provided the relative parity of the different bands is taken into account. Beyond this nesting picture, we observe shifts and splittings of numerous bands at the transition. We show that the splittings are surface sensitive and probably not a reliable signature of the magnetic order. On the other hand, the shifts indicate a significant redistribution of the orbital occupations at the transition, especially within the dxz/dyz system, which we discuss.},

Further increasing the strength of the Néel fluctuations leads to a low-Tc d-wave state, with a possible intermediate s+id phase. The results suggest that the absence of superconductivity in a series of hole-doped pnictides is due to the combination of short-range Néel fluctuations and pair-breaking impurity scattering and also that Tc of optimally doped pnictides could be further increased if residual (π, π) fluctuations were reduced.},

	abstract = {Immediately after the discovery of high temperature superconductivity in the cuprates in 1987, properties in the metallic state above Tc were discovered that violated the reigning paradigm in condensed matter physics: the quasiparticle concept due to Landau. The most discussed of such properties is the linear in temperature resistivity down to asymptotically low temperatures, sometimes called Planckian resistivity, above the region of the highest Tc. Similar anomalies have since also been discovered in the heavy-fermion compounds and in the Fe-based superconducting metals, and most recently in twisted bilayer graphene. Innumerable papers in the past three decades have pointed out that the linear in T resistivity and associated properties are a mystery and the most important unsolved problem in condensed matter physics; superconductivity itself is a corollary to the normal state properties. Even in this prolifically investigated field, quantitative experimental results on crucial normal state and superconducting state properties have only recently become available. It is now possible to compare some of the detailed predictions of a theory for the normal and superconductive state in cuprates and in heavy fermions with the experiments. The theory gives the frequency and temperature dependence of various normal state properties and also their measured magnitudes in terms of the same values of two parameters. It also resolves the paradox of d-wave symmetry of superconductivity in the cuprates given that the scattering rate of fermions in the normal state is nearly momentum independent. The same parameters that govern the normal state anomalies are also deduced from the quantitative analysis of data in the superconducting state in cuprates. The simplicity of the results depends on the discovery of a new class of quantum-critical fluctuation in which orthogonal topological excitations in space and time determine the spectra, such that the correlations of the critical spectra are a product of a function of space and a function of time with the spatial correlation length proportional to the logarithm of the temporal correlation length. The fermions scattering with such fluctuations form a marginal Fermi liquid.},

A large increase of the Sommerfeld coefficient γn is observed with both decreasing band filling and isovalent substitution (K, Rb, and Cs) revealing a strong enhancement of electron correlations and the possible proximity of these materials to a Mott insulator. This trend is well reproduced theoretically by our density functional theory + slave-spin (DFT+SS) calculations, confirming that 122-iron pnictides are effectively Hund metals, in which sizable Hund's coupling and orbital selectivity are the key ingredients for tuning correlations. We also find direct evidence for the existence of a coherence-incoherence crossover between a low-temperature heavy Fermi liquid and a highly incoherent high-temperature regime similar to heavy fermion systems. In the superconducting state, clear signatures of multiband superconductivity are observed with no evidence for nodes in the energy gaps, ruling out the existence of a doping-induced change of symmetry (from s to d wave). We argue that the disappearance of the electron band in the range 0.4{\textless}x{\textless}1.0 is accompanied by a strong-to-weak coupling crossover and that this shallow band remains involved in the superconducting pairing, although its contribution to the normal state fades away. Differences between hole- and electron-doped BaFe2As2 series are emphasized and discussed in terms of strong pair breaking by potential scatterers beyond the Born limit.},

We show that there are three different hole pockets around the Γ point: the two inner ones being nearly degenerate and rather two dimensional, the outer one presenting a strong three-dimensional character. The structure of the electron pockets is clarified by studying high doping contents, where they are enlarged. They are found to be essentially circular and two dimensional. From the size of the pockets, we deduce the number of holes and electrons present at the various dopings. We find that the net number of carriers is in good agreement with the bulk stoichiometry but that the number of each species (holes and electrons) is smaller than predicted by theory. Finally, we discuss the quality of nesting in the different regions of the phase diagram. The presence of the third hole pocket significantly weakens the nesting at x=0, so that it may not be a crucial ingredient in the formation of the spin-density wave.

Upon raising the temperature to above 150 K, the system evolves into a state in which the dxy bands have depleted spectral weight while the dxz/dyz bands remain metallic. Combined with theoretical calculations, our observations can be consistently understood as a temperature-induced crossover from a metallic state at low temperatures to an orbital-selective Mott phase at high temperatures. Moreover, the fact that the superconducting state of AxFe2−ySe2 is near the boundary of such an orbital-selective Mott phase constrains the system to have sufficiently strong on-site Coulomb interactions and Hund’s coupling, highlighting the nontrivial role of electron correlation in this family of iron-based superconductors.},

	abstract = {An intriguing aspect of unconventional superconductivity is that it always appears in the vicinity of other competing phases, whose suppression brings the full emergence of superconductivity. In the iron pnictides, these competing phases are marked by a tetragonal-to-orthorhombic structural transition and a collinear spin-density wave (SDW) transition. There has been macroscopic evidence for competition between these phases and superconductivity as the magnitude of both the orthorhombicity and magnetic moment are suppressed in the superconducting state. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on detwinned underdoped Ba1−xKxFe2As2, we observe a coexistence of both the SDW gap and superconducting gap in the same electronic structure. Furthermore, our data reveal that following the onset of superconductivity, the SDW gap decreases in magnitude and shifts in a direction consistent with a reduction of the orbital anisotropy. This observation provides direct spectroscopic evidence for the dynamic competition between superconductivity and both SDW and electronic nematic orders in these materials.},

This fundamental issue becomes especially relevant with the discovery of the iron chalcogenide superconductors. Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to measure three representative iron chalcogenides, FeTe0.56Se0.44, monolayer FeSe grown on SrTiO3 and K0.76Fe1.72Se2. We show that these superconductors are all strongly correlated, with an orbital-selective strong renormalization in the dxy bands despite having drastically different Fermi surface topologies. Furthermore, raising temperature brings all three compounds from a metallic state to a phase where the dxy orbital loses all spectral weight while other orbitals remain itinerant. These observations establish that iron chalcogenides display universal orbital-selective strong correlations that are insensitive to the Fermi surface topology, and are close to an orbital-selective Mott phase, hence placing strong constraints for theoretical understanding of iron-based superconductors.},

Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we reveal a complex three-dimensional electronic structure and compare it with density functional theory calculations. Multiple superconducting gaps were measured on various sheets of the Fermi surface. High-resolution resonant photoemission spectroscopy reveals magnetic order of the Eu 4f states deep into the superconducting phase. Both the absolute values and the anisotropy of the superconducting gaps are remarkably similar to the sibling compound without Eu, indicating that Eu magnetism does not affect the pairing of electrons. A complete decoupling between Fe- and Eu-derived states was established from their evolution with temperature, thus unambiguously demonstrating that superconducting and a long-range magnetic orders exist independently from each other. The established electronic structure of RbEuFe4As4 opens opportunities for the future studies of the highly unorthodox electron pairing and phase competition in this family of iron-based superconductors with doping.},

The vanadium substitutions in Fe sites are possible up to ∼40%. Hall effect measurements indicate strong hole-doping effect through V doping, while no superconductivity is observed in all samples down to 2 K. The antiferromagnetic and structural transition temperature of BaFe2As2 is gradually suppressed to finite temperature, then vanishes at  with the emergence of spin glass behavior, suggesting an avoided quantum critical point (QCP). Our results demonstrate that the avoided QCP and spin glass state which were previously reported in the superconducting phase of Co/Ni-doped BaFe2As2 can also be realized in non-superconducting Ba(Fe1−xVx)2As2.}

	abstract = {The nematic state, where a system is translationally invariant but breaks rotational symmetry, has drawn great attention recently due to the experimental observations of such a state in both cuprates and iron-based superconductors. The origin of nematicity and its possible tie to the pairing mechanism of high-Tc, however, still remain controversial. Here, we study the electronic structure of a multilayer FeSe film using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The band reconstruction in the nematic state is clearly delineated. We find that the energy splitting between dxz and dyz bands shows a nonmonotonic distribution in momentum space. From the Brillouin zone center to the Brillouin zone corner, the magnitude of splitting first decreases, then increases, and finally reaches the maximum value of ∼70 meV. Moreover, besides the dxz and dyz bands, band splitting was also observed on the dxy bands with a comparable energy scale around 45 meV. Our results suggest that the electronic anisotropy in the nematic state cannot be explained by a simple on-site ferro-orbital order. Instead, strong anisotropy exists in the hopping of all dxz,dyz, and dxy orbitals, the origin of which holds the key to a microscopic understanding of the nematicity in iron-based superconductors.},

	abstract = {Nematicity plays an important role in the physics of iron-based superconductors (IBS). Its microscopic origin and in particular its importance for the mechanism of high-temperature superconductivity itself are highly debated. A crucial knowledge in this regard is the degree to which the nematic order influences the electronic structure of these materials. Earlier angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) studies found that the effect is dramatic in three families of IBS including 11, 111, and 122 compounds: Energy splitting reaches 70 meV and Fermi surface becomes noticeably distorted. More recent experiments, however, reported significantly lower energy scale in 11 and 111 families, thus questioning the degree and universality of the impact of nematicity on the electronic structure of IBS. Here, we revisit the electronic structure of the undoped parent BaFe2As2 (122 family). Our systematic ARPES study, including the detailed temperature and photon energy dependencies, points to the significantly smaller energy scale also in this family of materials, thus establishing the universal scale of this phenomenon in IBS. Our results form a necessary quantitative basis for theories of high-temperature superconductivity focused on the nematicity.},

An ESR signal, indicative of the presence of localized magnetic moments, is observed only for M = Cu and Mn compounds, which display very low SC transition temperature (Tc) and no SC, respectively. From the ESR analysis assuming the absence of bottleneck effects, the microscopic parameters are extracted to show that this reduction of Tc cannot be accounted by the Abrikosov-Gorkov pair-breaking expression for a sign-preserving gap function.

The magnetic ordering associated with a structural transition at 139 K present in BaFe2As2  is completely suppressed by substitution of 5% Fe with Pt and superconductivity is induced at a critical temperature Tc = 23 K. Full diamagnetic screening in the magnetic susceptibility and a jump in the specific heat at Tc  confirm the bulk nature of the superconducting phase. All properties of the superconducting state—including the transition temperature Tc, the lower critical field Hc1 = 200 mT, the upper critical field Hc2≈  65 T, and the slope ∂Hc2/∂T—are comparable in value to those found in other transition metal-substituted BaFe2As2  series, indicating the robust nature of superconductivity induced by substitution of Group VIII elements.}

	abstract = {A series of 122 phase BaFe2−xNixAs2 (x=0, 0.055, 0.096, 0.18 and 0.23) single crystals was grown by the self-flux method and a dome-like Ni doping dependence of the superconducting transition temperature was discovered. The transition temperature Tcon reaches a maximum of 20.5 K at x=0.096, and it drops to below 4 K as x⩾0.23. The negative thermopower in the normal state indicates that the electron-like charge carrier indeed dominates in this system. This Ni-doped system provides another example of superconductivity induced by electron doping in the 122 phase.}

	abstract = {We study the interplay between Mott physics, driven by Coulomb repulsion U, and Hund physics, driven by Hund's coupling J, for a minimal model for Hund metals, the orbital-symmetric three-band Hubbard-Hund model (3HHM) for a lattice filling of 1/3. Hund-correlated metals are characterized by spin-orbital separation (SOS), a Hund's-rule-induced two-stage Kondo-type screening process, in which spin screening occurs at much lower energy scales than orbital screening. By contrast, in Mott-correlated metals, lying close to the phase boundary of a metal-insulator transition, the SOS window becomes negligibly small and the Hubbard bands are well separated. Using dynamical mean-field theory and the numerical renormalization group as real-frequency impurity solver, we identify numerous fingerprints distinguishing Hundness from Mottness in the temperature dependence of various physical quantities. These include ARPES-type spectra, the local self-energy, static local orbital and spin susceptibilities, resistivity, thermopower, and lattice and impurity entropies. Our detailed description of the behavior of these quantities within the context of a simple model Hamiltonian will be helpful for distinguishing Hundness from Mottness in experimental and theoretical studies of real materials.},

Density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT) calculations correctly reproduce this charge gap only when a strong Hund's coupling is considered. Thus, BaMn2As2 is a member of a wider class of Mn pnictide compounds that are Mott{\textendash}Hund insulators. We also present optical reflectance for metallic 2\%-K-doped BaMn2As2 that we use to extract the optical conductivity at different temperatures. The optical conductivity $\sigma$1($\omega$) exhibits a metallic response that is well described by a simple Drude term. Both $\sigma$($\omega${\textrightarrow}0,T) and $\rho$(T) exhibit Fermi-liquid temperature dependencies. From these measurements, we argue that a more strongly correlated Hund-metal version of the parent compounds of the iron pnictide superconductors has not yet been realized by doping this class of Hund insulators.},
