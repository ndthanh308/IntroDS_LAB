  "abstract": "Stacking bilayer structures is an efficient way to tune the topology of polaritons in in-plane anisotropic films, e.g., by leveraging the twist angle (TA). However, the effect of another geometric parameter, film thickness ratio (TR), on manipulating the plasmon topology in bilayers is elusive. Here, we fabricate bilayer structures of WTe2 films, which naturally host in-plane hyperbolic plasmons in the terahertz range. Plasmon topology is successfully modified by changing the TR and TA synergistically, manifested by the extinction spectra of unpatterned films and the polarization dependence of the plasmon intensity measured in skew ribbon arrays. Such TR- and TA-tunable topological transitions can be well explained based on the effective sheet optical conductivity by adding up those of the two films. Our study demonstrates TR as another degree of freedom for the manipulation of plasmonic topology in nanophotonics, exhibiting promising applications in bio-sensing, heat transfer and the enhancement of spontaneous emission.",
