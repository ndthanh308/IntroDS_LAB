  "abstract": "We characterize which planar graphs arise as the pullback, under a rational map $r$, of an analytic Jordan curve passing through the critical values of $r$. We also prove that such pullbacks are dense within the collection of $f^{-1}(Σ)$, where $f$ is a branched cover of the sphere and $Σ$ is a Jordan curve passing through the branched values of $f$.",
