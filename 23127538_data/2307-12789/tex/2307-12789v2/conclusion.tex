\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we have proposed and numerically investigated a new kind of three-body Förster resonant interactions induced by radio-frequency radiation in Rb Rydberg atoms. We then proposed a novel three-qubit quantum phase gate protocol based on the investigated resonances. The high protocol fidelity ($\sim 99.27 \%$) is mainly limited by the finite Rydberg lifetimes and can be significantly increased (up to $\sim 99.65 \%$) in a cryogenic environment. The gate behaviour is controlled via the RF radiation parameters solely, which greatly facilitates the implementation of the protocol and makes it more robust to deviations of DC field amplitude when compared to our previous proposals \cite{Beterov2018a,Ashkarin2022}.

Based on the presented research, we conclude that RF-induced F\"{o}rster resonances provide ample opportunities for the implementation of quantum operations in registers of ultracold neutral atoms. RF induction allows versatile tuning of the positions and strengths of resonance peaks, opening access to high-precision Rydberg dynamics control and entanglement production in large-scale registers. The high flexibility of the resonant protocol allows it to be implemented in various quantum register architectures, paving the way for the creation of fully interconnected neutral-atom-based quantum devices.
