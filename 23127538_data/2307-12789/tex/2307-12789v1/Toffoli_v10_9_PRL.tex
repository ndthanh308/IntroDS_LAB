\begin{abstract}

Registers of trapped neutral atoms, excited to Rydberg states to induce strong long-distance interactions, are extensively studied for direct applications in quantum computing. In this regard, new effective approaches to the creation of multiqubit quantum gates arise high interest. Here, we present a novel gate implementation technique based on RF-induced few-body F\"{o}rster resonances. External radio frequency (RF) control field allows us to manipulate the phase and population dynamics of many-atom system, thus enabling the realization of universal $CCR_{Z}(\phi)$ quantum gates. We numerically demonstrate RF-induced resonant interactions, as well as high-precision three-qubit gates. The extreme controllability of interactions provided by RF makes it possible to implement gates for a wide range of parameters of the atomic system, and significantly facilitates their experimental implementation. For the considered error sources, we achieve theoretical gate fidelities compatible with error correction ($\sim 99.7\%$) using reasonable experimental parameters.

\maketitle

Rydberg atom based quantum computing has aroused significant interest in recent years \cite{Madjarov2020, Graham2022, Cuadra2022, Morgado2021, Bluvstein2022, Graham2022} due to high scalability of atomic registers \cite{Ebadi2022, Scholl2021, Schymik2022} and long atomic lifetimes in individual traps \cite{Browaeys2020, Schymik2021}. Nevertheless, realization of fault-tolerant quantum computations requires significant improvement in the multi-qubit gate fidelities compared to nowadays experimental proposals \cite{Preskill2018, Cong2022, Baker2021}. Such gates allow to reduce the total gate count for complex quantum algorithms (QAOA \cite{Dlaska2022}, QEC \cite{Zhang2023}, Grover's search \cite{Tang2022}, etc.), thus paving a way to the practical applications of near-term NISQ devices \cite{Lanthaler2023, Daley2022}. In this regard, the search for interaction control methods to implement high-fidelity multi-qubit quantum gates becomes an important task \cite{Jandura2022, Henriet2020}.

In this letter, we propose a prospective approach to the creation of arbitrary double-controlled rotational $CCR_{Z}(\phi)$ quantum gates based on the use of three-body F\"{o}rster resonances \cite{Faoro2015, Tretyakov2017}, tailored by external radio frequency field \cite{Tretyakov2014, Beterov2018}. We describe for the first time RF-induced F\"{o}rster resonant transitions in ordered arrays of three $^{87}$Rb atoms. We show that under RF radiation, few-body resonances acquire replicas for parameters that can be chosen with the RF frequency. RF radiation thus provides new opportunities to facilitate the experimental realization of multi-qubit Rydberg gates, as well as it gives new degrees of freedom in interaction control, allowing us to significantly increase the accuracy of the gate implementation. The advantage of this technique is that it can be applied at large interatomic distances ($\sim 10$ \textmu m), paving a way to create full interconnectivity in large atomic arrays \cite{Hollerith2022, Saffman2010, Ramette2022}.

We consider fine-structure-state-changing F\"{o}rster resonances (Eq. \ref{eq1}), induced by external RF radiation in an ordered ensemble of $^{87}$Rb atoms \cite{Cheinet2020}. Three atoms, initially excited into equivalent Rydberg states $\ket{nP_{3/2}}$, pass into a collective state $\ket{nS_{1/2};(n+1)S_{1/2};nP_{1/2}}$ as a result of a Stark-induced resonant process.
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq1}
&\ket{nP_{3/2}}^{\otimes 3} \to \ket{nS_{1/2};(n+1)S_{1/2};nP_{1/2}}
\end{eqnarray}
Atoms are isolated in individual optical dipole traps arranged linearly at a distance $R$ from each other along the direction of the external control electric field. Note that arbitrary value for the principal quantum number $n$ can be chosen, according to the experimental requirements. For the demonstration purposes, we consider $n=70$, since a good compromise between robustness to small fluctuations of DC electric field and individual Rydberg lifetimes was shown for this value \cite{Cheinet2020, Ashkarin2022}. To reduce the number of basis states, we limit the collective state spectra by $\pm~2$~GHz relative to the energy of $\ket{70P_{3/2}}^{\otimes 3}$ state, thus considering only atomic states with a momentum value $l~\le~1$. Also, due to the linear configuration of the atomic ensemble, a selection rule $\Delta M = 0$ arises \cite{Ryabtsev2018, Beterov2018a}, which allows us to exclude states whose total moment projection differs from $M$ of the initial state. Thus, we significantly reduce the basis of states under consideration, down to $\sim 60$ collective states, presented by combinations of $\ket{70S_{1/2}}, \ket{71S_{1/2}},\ket{70P_{1/2}}, \ket{70P_{3/2}}$ magnetic sublevels.

Numerical approach to the simulation of resonant interactions induced by a time-dependent periodic electric field was analysed in detail in \cite{Ditzhuijzen2009}. Following the course of this work in combination with our previous study~\cite{Beterov2018a}, we solve numerically the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian based Schr\"{o}dinger equations for the complex amplitudes of the collective basis states taking into account Rydberg lifetimes~\cite{Beterov2009}.

During the simulation, we take into account the dipole-dipole interatomic interactions (DDI) \cite{Walker2008}, as well as the interaction of atoms with an external cumulative electric field $F = F_S+F_{RF}cos\left(2\pi\omega t\right)$ \cite{Ditzhuijzen2009}. Here $F_S$ denotes the static part of electric field (DC field), while $F_{RF}$ is the amplitude of RF field (AC field).

To provide a clear analytical description of our results we use Floquet sidebands approach \cite{Ditzhuijzen2009}. In a periodic field, the wave functions of the system acquire a periodic dependence on time, forming an infinite number of sidebands with amplitudes described by generalized Bessel functions. This leads to the formation of an infinite number of lines in the spectrum, separated by the frequency of the applied field $\omega$.

Figure~\ref{Res1}(a) depicts the three-body Förster resonances in a form of Stark diagram, including both the collective atomic states and their Floquet sidebands. The original three-body resonance (Eq. \ref{eq1}) is represented by the intersection of solid blue (initial $\ket{70P_{3/2}}^{\otimes 3}$ state) and red (final $\ket{70S_{1/2};71S_{1/2};70P_{1/2}}$ state) lines, and is indicated by the number 4. This resonance naturally exists in the corresponding DC electric field even in absence of RF radiation. Two RF-induced first-order resonances were found near the original three-body resonance, depicted by the intersections 1-2 and 6-7 between the original energy levels and corresponding Floquet sidebands. Also, resonances 3 and 5 appear in the same DC electric field as original resonance due to the Floquet sidebands intersection. These resonances are completely analogous to the original resonance 4 and do not create additional interaction channels. Note that during the calculation of the presented Stark diagrams, no interatomic interactions were taken into account.

In Figure~\ref{Res1}(b) numerically simulated three-body Förster resonances (Eq. \ref{eq1}) are shown. When RF radiation is turned off, only original resonance 4 remains (black line). Note that in the resonant process, we cannot attribute $\ket{70P_{3/2}} \to \ket{70S_{1/2}}$, $\ket{70P_{3/2}} \to \ket{71S_{1/2}}$ and $\ket{70P_{3/2}} \to \ket{70P_{1/2}}$ transitions to a specific atom in an ensemble. In this regard, several resonant interaction channels are formed, from which only two are allowed due to symmetry reasons \cite{Ryabtsev2018}. This process is similar to the Autler–Townes effect, and leads to the splitting of resonant peaks into 2 satellites, as it is shown in the Figure \ref{Res1}(b). Presence of the RF radiation induces additional first-order peaks (green line). The relative distances between the resonances correspond to the applied radiation frequency of 50 MHz. The displacement of the doublet centers relative to the expected resonant positions provided in Figure~\ref{Res1}(a), is due to the presense of the interatomic DDI for the complete simulation. The expected DC field of the resonance peak is also dependent on the AC Stark shift produced by the RF field applied. This effect is clearly noticeable for the original three-body resonance peak (black line on Fig.\ref{Res1}(b)), which shifts when the RF part of the field is switched on (central doublet, green line in Fig.\ref{Res1}(b)).

A great decrease of intensity can be seen for the left sideband (two leftmost peaks in Fig.\ref{Res1}(b), green line), when comparing with the right sideband. This effect is associated with the influence of two-body exchange interactions between $S$ and $P$ states, accompanied by exchange of momentum projection $m$. These interactions are resonant in the zero field due to the spectra degeneracy, thus provoking a significant leakage of the initial state population. The influence of such processes decreases quadratically when the DC field increases and becomes negligibly small for the original resonance \cite{Cheinet2020}. To avoid the unwanted influence of these transitions, we further concentrate on the rightmost peak from Fig.\ref{Res1}(b) (signed with asterisk) when considering any resonant dynamics.

RF-induced resonant three-body interactions shown in Fig.\ref{Res1} allows the direct control of phase and population dynamics of many-body Rydberg states in atomic ensemble. Thus, we state that presented interactions are promising candidates for the implementation of many-body quantum gate schemes. To prove this, we demonstrate below an example of $CCR_{Z}(\phi)$ gate scheme for arbitrary value of $\phi$.

The universal gate scheme we present is a substantial modification of our previous proposal \cite{Ashkarin2022}. The same linear arrangement of atomic qubits is kept, which was described above. We use the central atom as a target qubit, and two outer atoms as control ones. The significant improvement lies in the application of non-resonant DC electric field, which allows us to limit unwanted interactions during laser excitation, as well as avoid the influence of always-resonant zero-field interactions described above. We use RF field to induce the F\"{o}rster resonance (Eq. \ref{eq1}) for a chosen value of $F_S$ and thus implement a quantum double-controlled rotation gate $CCR_{Z}(\phi)$. Note that the DC part of the electric field is being kept constant during the whole process, thus facilitating the experimental implementation of the scheme.

The implementation of the desired $CCR_{Z}$ gate can be divided into a sequence of three steps (see Fig.\ref{Scheme}).

Step 1: The laser excitation $\pi$ pulses 1-3 are applied simultaneously to all three atomic qubits. We assume that prior to the excitation, the atoms were in their logical states (namely, $\ket{0}$ and $\ket{1}$). These states are represented by two pre-selected hyperfine sublevels of rubidium ground states $\ket{5S_{1/2}}$ \cite{Saffman2010, Beterov2021}. We consider fully resonant single-photon laser excitation in rotating wave approximation, assuming that only transitions of the form $\ket{1} \to \ket{R} = \ket{70P_{3/2}\left(|m|=1/2\right)}$ are allowed. For practical applications, a three-photon excitation scheme can be used to pair the logical states of qubits with Rydberg levels~\cite{Ryabtsev2011}. The effects associated with the phase and intensity noise of the laser were considered in \cite{De2018} and were not taken into account in this study.

Step 2: RF pulse of the duration $T$ is applied to the system, inducing resonance for a certain value of the DC electric field. This pulse is accompanied by two waiting times $T_{wait}^1$ and $T_{wait}^2$, which are as well configurable system parameters. The DC and AC parts of the electric field are co-directed, thus keeping the symmetry of the atomic system unchanged. The resonant interaction causes the phase of the collective state $\ket{RRR}$ to change by $\phi$ during the interaction time. This corresponds to a $CCR_Z(\phi)$-gate implementation, provided that all other states of the system remain unchanged after the application of RF radiation terminated.

Step 3: The de-excitation $-\pi$ pulses 4-6 are applied simultaneously to all three atomic qubits.


We performed numerous simulations of the operation of $CCR_Z(\phi)$ gate scheme for a wide range of $\phi$. The simulations were performed in an extended basis of states, which also included the logical states of qubits. For the first demonstration of the gate operation, we consider the implementation of the Toffoli gate (see Fig.~\ref{Toffoli}). We use the $CCR_Z(\pi)$ gate, supplementing it with two Hadamard gates on target qubit. These Hadamard gates are performed by two-photon Raman $Y_{\pi/2}$ pulses \cite{Zeng2017}.

Figure~\ref{Toffoli}(a) shows the behavior of the relevant collective states of the system in the case when the initial state of the register is $\ket{111}$. Note that we use standard qubit state notation $\ket{Control} \otimes \ket {Control} \otimes \ket{Target}$ for the register states, although in the proposed gate, target qubit is the central one. Due to the application of the Hadamard gate, the population is first evenly distributed between states $\ket{111}$ and $\ket{110}$. Then the atoms are excited into the Rydberg state $\left(\ket{RRR} + \ket{RR0}\right)/ \sqrt{2}$. The subsequent RF pulse, which in this case has a duration of 1.27 $\mu$s, induces a three-body resonance (Eq. \ref{eq1}), shown in Figure~\ref{Res1}(b) by the rightmost peak (signed with asterisk). As a result of the resonant interaction, the phase evolution accelerates, and the phase of the $\ket{RRR}$ state changes by $\pi$, thus leading to the final population interchange between $\ket{111}$ and $\ket{110}$ states.  Additional waiting times $T_{wait}^{1}$ and $T_{wait}^{2}$ allow to compensate for unwanted phase dynamics. The stages of de-excitation of atoms and the second application of the Hadamard gate complete the scheme.

Although two-body interactions are present in the system, they do not add any sizeable effect on the Rydberg states presented on Fig.\ref{Toffoli}(a). For the $\ket{RRR}$ state, the three-body resonance has a dominant influence. The $\ket{RR0}$ state, in turn, is characterized by a doubled distance between atoms excited into Rydberg states. In this case, the effect of the two-body interaction will be sufficiently weakened \cite{Walker2008}.

Figure~\ref{Toffoli}(b) depicts the simulated dynamics of populations in the case when only one of the controlling qubits was initialized into state $\ket{1}$. Insignificant population dynamics, expressed in small population oscillations of the $\ket{0RR}$ state, is associated here with the presence of non-resonant two-body interactions $\ket{70P_{3/2}}^{\otimes 2}\leftrightarrow \ket{70S_{1/2};71S_{1/2}}$. The two-body state $\ket{70S_{1/2};71S_{1/2}}$ can also interact off-resonantly with $\ket{70P_{1/2}}^{\otimes 2}$ and $\ket{70P_{3/2};70P_{1/2}}$  states. These interactions also lead to the accumulation of the phase shift of the collective Rydberg state, which, however, is fully compensated during the implementation of the gate. As a result, the population of the initial state $\ket{011}$ remains close to unity, while the population of the opposite state $\ket{010}$ stays close to zero after applying the pulse sequence. A detailed analysis of two-body interactions in three-body systems of Rydberg atoms is given in our previous articles~\cite{Ashkarin2022, Cheinet2020, Ryabtsev2018, Beterov2018}.

For initial states $\ket{100}$, $\ket{010}$, $\ket{001}$, the dynamics of the system is limited by the decay of the Rydberg state associated with finite lifetimes. Finally, for initial state $\ket{000}$, we assume the absence of any dynamics.

To estimate the individual gate fidelity, the method proposed in~\cite{Bowdrey2002} was used. We considered 6 single-qubit configuration states: $\ket{0}$, $\ket{1}$, $\left( \ket{0}+\ket{1} \right)/ \sqrt{2}$, $\left( \ket{0}-\ket{1} \right)/ \sqrt{2}$, $\left( \ket{0}+i\ket{1} \right)/ \sqrt{2}$ and $\left( \ket{0}-i\ket{1} \right)/ \sqrt{2}$. We formed a set of three-qubit states as all $6^3=216$ combinations of three single-qubit basis states. We simulated the density matrices $\rho_{sim}$ of all final states after $CCR_Z(\phi)$ gate was applied to each initial state. Then we calculated the fidelity of each final state comparing to the etalon state $\rho_{et}$, which is the final state of the ensemble after the perfect $CCR_Z(\phi)$ gate is performed~\cite{Nielsen2011}:
\begin{eqnarray}
\label{eq2}
F=Tr\sqrt{\sqrt{\rho_{et}}\rho_{sim}\sqrt{\rho_{et}}}
\end{eqnarray}
Averaging over all 216 states, we calculated $CCR_Z(\phi)$ gate fidelities for different values of $\phi$. Several exemplar results are shown in Table \ref{tab}. Note that the characteristics of the applied RF radiation are the only controlling parameters of the gate. To perform different phase gates, we only change $F_{RF}$ and $\omega$, and keep all the other parameters fixed.
\begin{table}
\caption{\label{tab} Estimated $CCR_Z(\phi)$ gate fidelities for different values of $\phi$. Results for room temperature (300 K) and cryogenic setup (4 K) are presented.

\end{ruledtabular}
\end{table}

For the described experimental conditions of resonance (Eq. \ref{eq1}), the average accuracy of gate implementation is $99.27\%$ for the room-temperature environment. The main source of fidelity losses ($\sim 0.51\%$) is the finiteness of the lifetimes of Rydberg states. Compensation for these losses down to $0.13\%$ can be achieved using a cryostat at 4 K \cite{Ximenez2023, Schymik2021} temperature for the proposed parameter values, increasing the average fidelity to $99.65\%$. Additional compensation for Rydberg lifetime losses can be achieved by using higher Rydberg levels \cite{Wu2021a, Saffman2010}. The losses associated with the non-optimal choice of parameter values are estimated as $\sim 0.22\%$ after the application of multiparametric optimization routines based on simulated annealing technique \cite{Suman2006}. However, this optimization is preliminary and does not allow us to obtain fully optimal parameter values in an atomic system due to the complexity of the task. Remaining losses could be compensated by applying additional multi-parametric optimization routines along with appropriate composite pulse sequences \cite{Torosov2011, Torosov2011a} and coherent control techniques \cite{Warren1993, Larrouy2020}. For practical applications, we propose to use simulated annealing method in conjunction with Nelder-Mead pre-processing \cite{Ali2014}. QAOA optimization techniques are also applicable \cite{Dlaska2022, Nguyen2023}.

To implement correct phase gates experimentally, it is necessary to pay attention to the required accuracy of the parameter values control. Assuming that the maximum allowable fidelity deviation from the maximum value cannot exceed $0.1\%$ we found the following requirements for parameter accuracy thresholds: the interatomic distance must be controlled with an accuracy of $20$ nm; the interaction time~-~$0.025$ \textmu s; DC electric field amplitude~-~$7 \cdot 10^{-5}$ V/cm, AC electric field amplitude~-~$9.2 \cdot 10^{-5}$ V/cm, RF frequency - $20$ kHz. While the control of the interaction time, as well as the frequency of RF radiation, do not present any experimental challenges \cite{Vankka2001}, the limiting factors are the complexity of the DC and AC field amplitudes control, along with the interatomic distance control. We propose to use closer interatomic distances for the chosen value of $n$ to reduce the possible errors in field amplitude control \cite{Ashkarin2022}.  A complete analysis on electric field registration was proposed both for DC \cite{Facon2016, Bowden2017} and AC \cite{Meyer2021, Sedlacek2012, Liao2020} fields in Rydberg systems. A proper level of interatomic distance control can be attained with modern holographic and AOD-based tweezer techniques \cite{Chew2022, Xu2022, Chen2022}.

Based on the presented research, we conclude that RF-induced F\"{o}rster resonances provide ample opportunities for the implementation of quantum operations in registers of ultracold neutral atoms. Using the amplitude and frequency of the RF radiation as control utilities, one can gain access to complex resonant interactions, producing entanglement in a large-scale register. The high flexibility of the scheme allows it to be implemented in various architectures of quantum registers, paving the way for the creation of fully interconnected quantum devices.
