  "abstract": "The ATLAS and TOTEM collaborations have measured the differential elastic cross section at centre-of mass energy $\\sqrt{s}$=13 TeV and at small four-moment squared $|t|$. The data at very small $|t|$ i.e. $|t|<0.01GeV^{2}$ have been analysed in terms of so called AKM (Auberson, Kinoshita and Martin) oscillations. An indication of a possible oscillation of this type had previously been reported at $\\sqrt{s}$=541 GeV using data from the UA4/2 experiment. There are no such indications in the data at 13 TeV examined here.",
