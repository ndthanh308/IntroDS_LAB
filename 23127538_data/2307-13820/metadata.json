  "abstract": "This paper is devoted to the numerical solution of constrained energy minimization problems arising in computational physics and chemistry such as the Gross-Pitaevskii and Kohn-Sham models. In particular, we introduce the Riemannian Newton methods on the infinite-dimensional Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds. We study the geometry of these two manifolds, its impact on the Newton algorithms, and present expressions of the Riemannian Hessians in the infinite-dimensional setting, which are suitable for variational spatial discretizations. A series of numerical experiments illustrates the performance of the methods and demonstrates its supremacy compared to other well-established schemes such as the self-consistent field iteration and gradient descent schemes.",
