%    abstract = { We have dealt with the twist-4 T-even transverse momentum dependent parton distributions (TMDs) for the case of proton in the light-front quark–diquark model (LFQDM). By decoding the unintegrated quark–quark correlator for the semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS), we have specifically obtained the overlap form for the unpolarized (f3ν(x,p⊥2)), longitudinally polarized (g3Lν(x,p⊥2),h3L⊥ν(x,p⊥2)) and transversely polarized (g3Tν(x,p⊥2),h3Tν(x,p⊥2) and h3Tν⊥(x,p⊥2)) proton TMDs. We have provided the explicit expressions for both the cases of the diquark being a scalar or a vector. Average transverse momenta and the average square transverse momenta for the TMDs have been calculated and the results have been tabulated with corresponding leading twist TMDs. In addition, the value of average transverse momentum and average square transverse momentum for TMD f3ν(x,p⊥2) has been compared with the available light-front constituent quark model (LFCQM) results. From TMDs, we have also obtained and discussed the transverse momentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDPDFs). The model relations of the twist-4 T-even TMDs with the available leading twist T-even TMDs have also been obtained. }

abstract = {In this study, the T-even sub-leading twist transverse momentum dependent distributions (TMDs) of proton in the light-front quark-diquark model (LFQDM) have been investigated. We have derived the overlap form of the light-front wave functions (LFWFs) for the sub-leading twist proton TMDs by detangling the un-integrated quark-quark correlator for the semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS). We have obtained the explicit expressions of TMDs for both the cases of the diquark being a scalar or a vector and analyzed their relationships with leading twist TMDs within the same model. Average transverse momenta and average square transverse momenta for the TMDs have been tabulated and compared with the results from the light-front bag model and the light-front constituent quark model (LFCQM). In addition to this, we have also compared our results for the PDF e(x) with the recent CLAS collaboration results.
