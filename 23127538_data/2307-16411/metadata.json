  "abstract": "The higher twist T-even transverse momentum dependent distribution (TMD) $h_3(x, {\\bf p_\\perp^2})$ for the proton has been examined in the light-front quark-diquark model (LFQDM). By deciphering the unintegrated quark-quark correlator for semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering (SIDIS), we have derived explicit equations of the TMD for both the scenarios when the diquark is a scalar or a vector. Average as well as average square transverse momenta have been computed for this TMD. Additionally, we have discussed its transverse momentum dependent parton distribution function (TMDPDF) $h_3(x)$.",
