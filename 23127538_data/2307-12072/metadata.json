  "abstract": "The fluid flow across an unbounded horizontal plate embedded with uniform mass diffusion is studied in this article together with the impacts of the chemical reaction and parabolic motion, while the temperature and concentration of the plate remain constant. Using initial and boundary conditions, partial differential equations were used to describe this phenomenon. Introduce some appropriate non-dimensional variables and utilize the Laplace transform method to solve the corresponding dimensionless equations. The following analytical remedies for heat, velocity and concentration profiles were produced in terms of exponential and (erfc) complementary error functions. A MATLAB programme is used to exhibit the results as graphs for various parameters. By creating graphs, we may assess the characteristics of the velocity, Heat and concentration while also studying the physical aspects for various factors.",
