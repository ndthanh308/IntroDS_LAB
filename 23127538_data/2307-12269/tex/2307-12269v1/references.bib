	Abstract = {We observed electronic Kagome lattice and possible nontrivial electronic flat band in twisted multilayer silicene at 77 K. The energy dispersion of fermions or bosons vanishes in momentum space if destructive quantum interference occurs in a frustrated Kagome lattice with only nearest-neighbor hopping. A discrete flat band (FB) without any dispersion is consequently formed, promising the emergence of fractional quantum Hall states at high temperatures. Here, we report the experimental realization of an FB with possible nontrivial topology in an electronic Kagome lattice on twisted multilayer silicene. Because of the unique low-buckled two-dimensional structure of silicene, a robust electronic Kagome lattice has been successfully induced by moir{\'e} patterns after twisting the silicene multilayers. The electrons are localized in the Kagome lattice because of quantum destructive interference, and thus, their kinetic energy is quenched, which gives rise to an FB peak in the density of states. A robust and pronounced one-dimensional edge state has been revealed at the Kagome edge, which resides at higher energy than the FB. Our observations of the FB and the exotic edge state in electronic Kagome lattice open up the possibility that fractional Chern insulators could be realized in two-dimensional materials.},

	Annote = {Kagome-lattices of 3d-transition metals hosting Weyl/Dirac fermions and topological flat bands exhibit non-trivial topological characters and novel quantum phases, such as the anomalous Hall effect and fractional quantum Hall effect. With consideration of spin--orbit coupling and electron correlation, several instabilities could be induced. The typical characters of the electronic structure of a kagome lattice, i.e., the saddle point, Dirac-cone, and flat band, around the Fermi energy (EF) remain elusive in magnetic kagome materials. We present the experimental observation of the complete features in ferromagnetic kagome layers of YMn6Sn6 helically coupled along the c-axis, by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and band structure calculations. We demonstrate a Dirac dispersion near EF, which is predicted by spin-polarized theoretical calculations, carries an intrinsic Berry curvature and contributes to the anomalous Hall effect in transport measurements. In addition, a flat band and a saddle point with a high density of states near EF are observed. These multi-sets of kagome features are of orbital-selective origin and could cause multi-orbital magnetism. The Dirac fermion, flat band and saddle point in the vicinity of EF open an opportunity in manipulating the topological properties in magnetic materials.},

	Annote = {A kagome lattice of 3d transition metal ions is a versatile platform for correlated topological phases hosting symmetry-protected electronic excitations and magnetic ground states. However, the paradigmatic states of the idealized two-dimensional kagome lattice---Dirac fermions and flat bands---have not been simultaneously observed. Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and de Haas--van Alphen quantum oscillations to reveal coexisting surface and bulk Dirac fermions as well as flat bands in the antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeSn, which has spatially decoupled kagome planes. Our band structure calculations and matrix element simulations demonstrate that the bulk Dirac bands arise from in-plane localized Fe-3d orbitals, and evidence that the coexisting Dirac surface state realizes a rare example of fully spin-polarized two-dimensional Dirac fermions due to spin-layer locking in FeSn. The prospect to harness these prototypical excitations in a kagome lattice is a frontier of great promise at the confluence of topology, magnetism and strongly correlated physics.},

	Annote = {The kagome lattice has long been regarded as a theoretical framework that connects lattice geometry to unusual singularities in electronic structure. Transition metal kagome compounds have been recently identified as a promising material platform to investigate the long-sought electronic flat band. Here we report the signature of a two-dimensional flat band at the surface of antiferromagnetic kagome metal FeSn by means of planar tunneling spectroscopy. Employing a Schottky heterointerface of FeSn and an n-type semiconductor Nb-doped SrTiO3, we observe an anomalous enhancement in tunneling conductance within a finite energy range of FeSn. Our first-principles calculations show this is consistent with a spin-polarized flat band localized at the ferromagnetic kagome layer at the Schottky interface. The spectroscopic capability to characterize the electronic structure of a kagome compound at a thin film heterointerface will provide a unique opportunity to probe flat band induced phenomena in an energy-resolved fashion with simultaneous electrical tuning of its properties. Furthermore, the exotic surface state discussed herein is expected to manifest as peculiar spin-orbit torque signals in heterostructure-based spintronic devices.},

	Annote = {Electronic flat bands in momentum space, arising from strong localization of electrons in real space, are an ideal stage to realize strongly-correlated phenomena. Theoretically, the flat bands can naturally arise in certain geometrically frustrated lattices, often with nontrivial topology if combined with spin-orbit coupling. Here, we report the observation of topological flat bands in frustrated kagome metal CoSn, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and band structure calculations. Throughout the entire Brillouin zone, the bandwidth of the flat band is suppressed by an order of magnitude compared to the Dirac bands originating from the same orbitals. The frustration-driven nature of the flat band is directly confirmed by the chiral d-orbital texture of the corresponding real-space Wannier functions. Spin-orbit coupling opens a large gap of 80 meV at the quadratic touching point between the Dirac and flat bands, endowing a nonzero Z2 invariant to the flat band. These findings demonstrate that kagome-derived flat bands are a promising platform for novel emergent phases of matter at the confluence of strong correlation and topology.},

We observe a pronounced peak at the Fermi level, which we identify as arising from the kinetically frustrated kagome flat band. On increasing the magnetic field up to $\pm$8 T, this state exhibits an anomalous magnetization-polarized many-body Zeeman shift, dominated by an orbital moment that is opposite to the field direction. Such negative magnetism is induced by spin--orbit-coupling quantum phase effects21--25 tied to non-trivial flat band systems.

Specifically, we compare the density functional theory (DFT) based wavefunctions with and without spin-orbit coupling and compute the `spin-orbit-spillage'as a measure of band-inversion. Due to its ease of calculation, without any need for symmetry analysis or dense k-point interpolation, the spillage is an excellent tool for identifying topologically non-trivial materials. Out of 30000 materials available in the JARVIS-DFT database, we applied this methodology to more than 4835 non-magnetic materials consisting of heavy atoms and low bandgaps. We found 1868 candidate materials with high-spillage (using 0.5 as a threshold). We validated our methodology by carrying out conventional Wannier-interpolation calculations for 289 candidate materials. We demonstrate that in addition to Z2 topological insulators, this screening method successfully identified many semimetals and topological crystalline insulators. Importantly, our approach is applicable to the investigation of disordered or distorted as well as magnetic materials, because it is not based on symmetry considerations. We discuss some individual example materials, as well as trends throughout our dataset, which is available at the websites: https://www.ctcms.nist.gov/\~{}knc6/JVASP.html and https://jarvis.nist.gov/.},

title = {Electronic structure calculations with GPAW: a real-space implementation of the projector
augmented-wave method},
journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {Electronic structure calculations have become an indispensable tool in many areas of materials science and quantum chemistry. Even though the Kohn–Sham formulation of the density-functional theory (DFT) simplifies the many-body problem significantly, one is still confronted with several numerical challenges. In this article we present the projector augmented-wave (PAW) method as implemented in the GPAW program package (https://wiki.fysik.dtu.dk/gpaw) using a uniform real-space grid representation of the electronic wavefunctions. Compared to more traditional plane wave or localized basis set approaches, real-space grids offer several advantages, most notably good computational scalability and systematic convergence properties. However, as a unique feature GPAW also facilitates a localized atomic-orbital basis set in addition to the grid. The efficient atomic basis set is complementary to the more accurate grid, and the possibility to seamlessly switch between the two representations provides great flexibility. While DFT allows one to study ground state properties, time-dependent density-functional theory (TDDFT) provides access to the excited states. We have implemented the two common formulations of TDDFT, namely the linear-response and the time propagation schemes. Electron transport calculations under finite-bias conditions can be performed with GPAW using non-equilibrium Green functions and the localized basis set. In addition to the basic features of the real-space PAW method, we also describe the implementation of selected exchange–correlation functionals, parallelization schemes, ΔSCF-method, x-ray absorption spectra, and maximally localized Wannier orbitals.}

abstract = {The Atomic Simulation Recipes (ASR) is an open source Python framework for working with atomistic materials simulations in an efficient and sustainable way that is ideally suited for high-throughput projects. Central to ASR is the concept of a Recipe: a high-level Python script that performs a well defined simulation task robustly and accurately while keeping track of the data provenance. The ASR leverages the functionality of the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) to interface with external simulation codes and attain a high abstraction level. We provide a library of Recipes for common simulation tasks employing density functional theory and many-body perturbation schemes. These Recipes utilize the GPAW electronic structure code, but may be adapted to other simulation codes with an ASE interface. Being independent objects with automatic data provenance control, Recipes can be freely combined through Python scripting giving maximal freedom for users to build advanced workflows. ASR also implements a command line interface that can be used to run Recipes and inspect results. The ASR Migration module helps users maintain their data while the Database and App modules makes it possible to create local databases and present them as customized web pages.}

journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
abstract = {The atomic simulation environment (ASE) is a software package written in the Python programming language with the aim of setting up, steering, and analyzing atomistic simulations. In ASE, tasks are fully scripted in Python. The powerful syntax of Python combined with the NumPy array library make it possible to perform very complex simulation tasks. For example, a sequence of calculations may be performed with the use of a simple ‘for-loop’ construction. Calculations of energy, forces, stresses and other quantities are performed through interfaces to many external electronic structure codes or force fields using a uniform interface. On top of this calculator interface, ASE provides modules for performing many standard simulation tasks such as structure optimization, molecular dynamics, handling of constraints and performing nudged elastic band calculations.}

abstract = {Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (TR-ARPES) provides access to the ultrafast evolution of electrons and many-body interactions in solid-state systems. However, the momentum- and energy-resolved transient photoemission intensity may not be unambiguously described by the intrinsic relaxation dynamics of photoexcited electrons alone. The interpretation of the time-dependent photoemission signal can be affected by the transient evolution of the electronic distribution, and both the one-electron removal spectral function as well as the photoemission matrix elements. Here we investigate the topological insulator Bi1.1Sb0.9Te2S to demonstrate, by means of a detailed probe-polarization dependent study, the transient contribution of matrix elements  to TR-ARPES.}

@article{DiSante_2023,
	abstract = {Kagome materials have emerged as a setting for emergent electronic phenomena that encompass different aspects of symmetry and topology. It is debated whether the XV6Sn6 kagome family (where X is a rare-earth element), a recently discovered family of bilayer kagome metals, hosts a topologically non-trivial ground state resulting from the opening of spin--orbit coupling gaps. These states would carry a finite spin Berry curvature, and topological surface states. Here we investigate the spin and electronic structure of the XV6Sn6 kagome family. We obtain evidence for a finite spin Berry curvature contribution at the centre of the Brillouin zone, where the nearly flat band detaches from the dispersing Dirac band because of spin--orbit coupling. In addition, the spin Berry curvature is further investigated in the charge density wave regime of ScV6Sn6 and it is found to be robust against the onset of the temperature-driven ordered phase. Utilizing the sensitivity of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy to the spin and orbital angular momentum, our work unveils the spin Berry curvature of topological kagome metals and helps to define its spectroscopic fingerprint.},
