  "abstract": "Understanding the profound impact of correlation effects and crystal imperfections is essential for an accurate description of solids. Here we study the role of correlation, disorder, and multi-magnon processes in THz magnons. Our findings reveal that a significant part of the electron self-energy, which goes beyond the adiabatic local spin density approximation, arises from the interaction between electrons and a virtual magnon gas. This interaction leads to a substantial modification of the exchange splitting and a renormalization of magnon energies, in agreement with the experimental data. We establish a quantitative hierarchy of magnon relaxation processes based on first principles.",
