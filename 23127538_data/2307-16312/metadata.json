  "abstract": "An open-locating-dominating set of a graph models a detection system for a facility with a possible \"intruder\" or a multiprocessor network with a possible malfunctioning processor. A \"sensor\" or \"detector\" is assumed to be installed at a subset of vertices where it can detect an intruder or a malfunctioning processor in their neighborhood, but not at itself. We consider a fault-tolerant variant of an open-locating-dominating set called an error-correcting open-locating-dominating set, which can correct a false-positive or a false-negative signal from a detector. In particular, we prove the problem of finding a minimum error-correcting open-locating-dominating set in an arbitrary graph is NP-complete. Additionally, we characterize the existence criteria for an error-correcting open-locating-dominating sets for an arbitrary graph. We also consider extremal graphs that require every vertex to be a detector and minimum error-correcting open-locating-dominating sets in infinite grids.",
