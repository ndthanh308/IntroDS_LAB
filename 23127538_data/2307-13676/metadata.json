  "abstract": "Networks of coupled Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs) are a leading physical platform for analog solving of complex optimization problems. These systems are colloquially known as ``Ising machines''. We experimentally and theoretically study such a network under the influence of an external force. The force breaks the collective phase-parity symmetry of the system and competes with the intrinsic coupling in ordering the network configuration, similar to how a magnetic field biases an interacting spin ensemble. Specifically, we demonstrate how the force can be used to control the system, and highlight the crucial role of the phase and symmetry of the force. Our work thereby provides a method to create Ising machines with arbitrary bias, extending even to exotic cases that are impossible to engineer in real spin systems.",
