\section{CONCLUSIONS}
\label{sec:conclusions}
In this work we proposed ACTOR, a novel framework for active tactile-based category-level transparent object reconstruction. By learning with only synthetic object models, ACTOR is capable of performing real-world transparent object reconstruction through sparse tactile data. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art GPIS method in terms of reconstruction accuracy. Furthermore, we demonstrated category-level pose estimation with the reconstructed object model and our approach outperforms baseline ICP and S-ICP methods.
% We also performed tactile-based recognition of the transparent object using ACTOR, thus demonstrating the versatility of our proposed framework. 
As future work, we would like to extend ACTOR for safely manipulating transparent objects in unstructured scenarios with possible deformability and dynamic center of mass~\cite{kaboli2016tactile, kaboli2015hand, yao2017tactile}.
