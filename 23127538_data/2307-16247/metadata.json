  "abstract": "The launch of NASA's Kepler space telescope in 2009 revolutionized the quality and quantity of observational data available for asteroseismic analysis. While Kepler was able to detect solar-like oscillations in hundreds of main-sequence and subgiant stars, the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is now making similar observations for thousands of the brightest stars in the sky. The Asteroseismic Modeling Portal (AMP) is an automated and objective stellar model-fitting pipeline for asteroseismic data, which was originally developed to use models from the Aarhus Stellar Evolution Code (ASTEC). We briefly summarize an updated version of the AMP pipeline that uses Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA), and we present initial modeling results for the Sun and several solar analogs to validate the precision and accuracy of the inferred stellar properties.",
