  "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the dynamics of Rényi negativities after a quantum quench in the free-boson chain with homogeneous dissipation. Initially we prepare the system in the squeezed thermal state, and then let it evolves under the tight-binding bosonic Hamiltonian with local linear dissipation. We use the Lindblad equation to solve the time evolution of the covariance matrix, from which one can obtain the time dependence of Rényi negativities. We are interested in the weak dissipation hydrodynamic limit where a quasi-particle picture emerges. In this limit, exact results of non-equilibrium dynamics of Rényi negativities can be obtained using the stationary phase method. We consider the Rényi negativities between both adjacent and disjoint regions in a infinite chain. We numerically test our analytical predictions and perfect matches have found.",
