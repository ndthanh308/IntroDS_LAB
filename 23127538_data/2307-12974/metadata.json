  "abstract": "Long-wave infrared (LWIR, 8-12 $μm$ wavelengths) is a spectral band of vital importance to thermal imaging. Conventional LWIR optics made from single-crystalline Ge and chalcogenide glasses are bulky and fragile. The challenge is exacerbated for wide field-of-view (FOV) optics, which traditionally mandates multiple cascaded elements that severely add to complexity and cost. Here we designed and experimentally realized a LWIR metalens platform based on bulk Si wafers featuring 140$^\\circ$ FOV. The metalenses, which have diameters exceeding 4 cm, were fabricated using a scalable wafer-level process involving photolithography and deep reactive ion etching. Using a metalens-integrated focal plane array, we further demonstrated wide-angle thermal imaging.",
