  "abstract": "Recent work of Kurasov and Sarnak provides a method for constructing one-dimensional Fourier quasicrystals (FQ) from the torus zero sets of a special class of multivariate polynomials called Lee-Yang polynomials. In particular, they provided a non-periodic FQ with unit coefficients and uniformly discrete support, answering an open question posed by Meyer. Their method was later shown to generate all one-dimensional Fourier quasicrystals with $\\mathbb{N}$-valued coefficients ($ \\mathbb{N} $-FQ).\n  In this paper, we characterize which Lee-Yang polynomials give rise to non-periodic $ \\mathbb{N} $-FQs with unit coefficients and uniformly discrete support, and show that this property is generic among Lee-Yang polynomials. We also show that the infinite sequence of gaps between consecutive atoms of any $\\mathbb{N}$-FQ has a well-defined distribution, which, under mild conditions, is absolutely continuous. This generalizes previously known results for the spectra of quantum graphs to arbitrary $\\mathbb{N}$-FQs. Two extreme examples are presented: first, a sequence of $\\mathbb{N}$-FQs whose gap distributions converge to a Poisson distribution. Second, a sequence of random Lee-Yang polynomials that results in random $\\mathbb{N}$-FQs whose empirical gap distributions converge to that of a random unitary matrix (CUE).",
