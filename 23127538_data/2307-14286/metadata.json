  "abstract": "We consider the Laplace operator in the exterior of a compact set in the plane, subject to Robin boundary conditions. If the boundary coupling is sufficiently negative, there are at least two discrete eigenvalues below the essential spectrum. We state a general conjecture that the second eigenvalue is maximised by the exterior of a disk under isochoric or isoperimetric constraints. We prove an isoelastic version of the conjecture for the exterior of convex domains. Finally, we establish a monotonicity result for the second eigenvalue under the condition that the compact set is strictly star-shaped and centrally symmetric.",
