  "abstract": "A structural order parameter for disordered configurations is defined, based, not on local topologies, but on the degree of local restraint imposed on each atom. This restraint parameter provides a clear distinction between a strong liquid (SiO2) and a fragile liquid (a binary Lennard-Jones mixture) without reference to dynamics. Where the fragile liquid exhibits an abrupt transition from unrestrained to restrain below the melting point, molten silica is highly constrained even at equilibrium. We determine the temperature dependence of the average number of particles restrained per pinned particle and consider the feature of the potential energy landscape responsible for determining the fragility.",
