  "abstract": "In this paper, we consider locally wedge-shaped manifolds, which are Riemannian manifolds that are allowed to have both boundary and certain types of edges. We define and study the properties of free boundary minimal hypersurfaces inside locally wedge-shaped manifolds. In particular, we show a compactness theorem for free boundary minimal hypersurfaces with curvature and area bounds in a locally wedge-shaped manifold. Additionally, using Schoen-Simon-Yau's estimates, we also prove a Bernstein-type theorem indicating that, under certain conditions, a stable free boundary minimal hypersurface inside a Euclidean wedge must be a portion of a hyperplane. As our main application, we establish a curvature estimate for sufficiently regular free boundary minimal hypersurfaces in a locally wedge-shaped manifold with certain wedge angle assumptions. We expect this curvature estimate will be useful for establishing a min-max theory for the area functional in wedge-shaped spaces.",
