  "abstract": "Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs) are known to play an important role in the communication between distant cells and to deliver biological information throughout the body. To date, many studies have focused on the role of sEVs characteristics such as cell origin, surface composition, and molecular cargo on the resulting uptake by the recipient cell. Yet, a full understanding of the sEV fusion process with recipient cells and in particular the role of cell membrane physical properties on the uptake are still lacking. Here we explore this problem using sEVs from a cellular model of triple-negative breast cancer fusing to a range of synthetic planar lipid bilayers both with and without cholesterol, and designed to mimic the formation of raft-like nanodomains in cell membranes. Using time-resolved Atomic Force Microscopy we were able to track the sEVs interaction with the different model membranes, showing the process to be strongly dependent on the local membrane fluidity. The strongest interaction and fusion is observed over the less fluid regions, with sEVs even able to disrupt ordered domains at sufficiently high cholesterol concentration. Our findings suggest the biophysical characteristics of recipient cell membranes to be crucial for sEVs uptake regulation.",
