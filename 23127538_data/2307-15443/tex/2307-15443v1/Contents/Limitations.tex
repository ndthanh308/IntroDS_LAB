\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:Limitations}
Since our method uses the deep ISP pipeline, the training speed will slower than RGB watermarking methods. This is because the gradient of the entire ISP pipeline needs to be calculated. In the future, using a smaller deep ISP pipeline can improve the training speed.
At present, our method is limited to encoding and decoding RAW image pixel blocks of a fixed size. However, due to the considerable size of the RAW image in practical applications, we have opted to encode only the central area pixel block. If we choose other pixel blocks to add watermarking, we need to manually locate the watermarking pixel block from the RGB image. At the same time, since we use pixel blocks to add watermarking, the whole RGB results will have an obvious boundary around watermarked blocks.
