This paper introduces an innovative end-to-end framework, referred to as \textbf{RAWIW}, with the primary goal of providing copyright protection for RAW images. The framework consists of a watermarking module, a deep ISP module, and a distortion network. Additionally, we employ an effective three-stage training strategy to strike a balance between the robustness and concealment of watermarking. The proposed method is validated on two RAW image datasets, namely ZRR dataset and SR-RAW dataset. The results demonstrate that the RAWIW framework exhibits robustness to different ISP pipelines and distortions during transmission, all while minimizing the impact on the visual quality of the resulting RGB images. As for future work, we plan to delve further into investigating strategies to enhance the robustness and concealment capabilities of the watermarking process. By continuously refining the framework, we aim to bolster its performance and broaden its applicability in various scenarios related to RAW image copyright protection.
