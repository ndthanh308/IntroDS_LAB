   abstract = {Generative deep learning is powering a wave of new innovations in materials design. In this article, we discuss the basic operating principles of these methods and their advantages over rational design through the lens of a case study on refractory high-entropy alloys for ultra-high-temperature applications. We present our computational infrastructure and workflow for the inverse design of new alloys powered by these methods. Our preliminary results show that generative models can learn complex relationships in order to generate novelty on demand, making them a valuable tool for materials informatics.},

   abstract = {Multicomponent alloys containing several components in equal atomic proportions have been manufactured by casting and melt spinning, and their microstructures and properties have been investigated by a combination of optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, electron probe microanalysis, X-ray diffractrometry and microhardness measurements. Alloys containing 16 and 20 components in equal proportions are multiphase, crystalline and brittle both as-cast and after melt spinning. A five component Fe 20 Cr 20 Mn 20 Ni 20 Co 20 alloy forms a single fcc solid solution which solidifies dendritically. A wide range of other six to nine component late transition metal rich multicomponent alloys exhibit the same majority fcc primary dendritic phase, which can dissolve substantial amounts of other transition metals such as Nb, Ti and V. More electronegative elements such as Cu and Ge are less stable in the fcc dendrites and are rejected into the interdendritic regions. The total number of phases is always well below the maximum equilibrium number allowed by the Gibbs phase rule, and even further below the maximum number allowed under non-equilibrium solidification conditions. Glassy structures are not formed by casting or melt spinning of late transition metal rich multicomponent alloys, indicating that the confusion principle does not apply, and other factors are more important in promoting glass formation.},

While RHEAs, by original definition, are alloys consisting of five or more principal elements with the concentration of each of these elements between 5 and 35 at.\%, RCCAs can contain three or more principal elements and the element concentration can be greater than 35\%. The 151 reported RHEAs/RCCAs are analyzed based on their composition, processing methods, microstructures, and phases. Mechanical properties, strengthening and deformation mechanisms, oxidation, and corrosion behavior, as well as tribology, of RHEA/RCCAs are summarized. Unique properties of some of these alloys make them promising candidates for high temperature applications beyond Ni-based superalloys and/or conventional refractory alloys. Methods of development and exploration, future directions of research and development, and potential applications of RHEAs are discussed.},

   abstract = {Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) show a great potential as structural materials due to their remarkable properties, such as high strength and thermal stability. Despite these advantages, the RHEAs still suffer from the limited ductility at room temperature. To overcome the strength-ductility trade-off, the new RHEA design strategy, transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) HEAs, have been developed by applying metastability-engineering approach. With the newly developed RHEAs design strategy, we designed metastable RHEAs, TiZrHfVxNbxTax (x = 1.0, 0.5 and 0.1) with decrease of the β-stabilizing elements (V, Nb, and Ta) to promote the transformation-induced ductility and work-hardening capability. The proper addition of the β-stabilizing elements (V, Nb, and Ta) into the ternary equi-molar TiZrHf alloy (TiZrHfV0.1Nb0.1Ta0.1) leads to stress/strain-induced phase transformation from the body-centered cubic (BCC) to hexagonal-close-packed (HCP) α′ and/or orthorhombic α″ phases. Detailed studies on the phase transformation sequence during the deformation were carried out using X-ray diffraction (XRD), electron back-scattered diffraction (EBSD), and transmission-electron microscope (TEM), which revealed the stepwise phase transformation that is responsible for the strong strain hardening behavior. Furthermore, we further suggested the new transformation-induced-plasticity (TRIP) HEA design strategy, applying the Bo-Md approach.},

	journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},
	abstract = {Advances in machine learning (ML), especially in the cooperation between ML predictions, density functional theory (DFT) based first-principles calculations, and experimental verification are emerging as a key part of a new paradigm to understand fundamentals, verify, analyze, and predict data, and design and discover materials. Taking stacking fault energy (γ SFE) as an example, we perform a correlation analysis of γ SFE in dilute Al-, Ni-, and Pt-based alloys by descriptors and ML algorithms. These γ SFE values were predicted by DFT-based alias shear deformation approach, and up to 49 elemental descriptors and 21 regression algorithms were examined. The present work indicates that (i) the variation of γ SFE affected by alloying elements can be quantified through 14 elemental attributes based on their statistical significances to decrease the mean absolute error (MAE) in ML predictions, and in particular, the number of p valence electrons, a descriptor second only to the covalent radius in importance to model performance, is unexpected; (ii) the alloys with elements close to Ni and Co in the periodic table possess higher γ SFE values; (iii) the top four outliers of DFT predictions of γ SFE are for the alloys of Al23La, Pt23Au, Ni23Co, and Al23Be based on the analyses of statistical differences between DFT and ML predictions; and (iv) the best ML model to predict γ SFE is produced by Gaussian process regression with an average MAE < 8 mJ m−2. Beyond detailed analysis of the Al-, Ni-, and Pt-based alloys, we also predict the γ SFE values using the present ML models in other fcc-based dilute alloys (i.e., Cu, Ag, Au, Rh, Pd, and Ir) with the expected MAE < 17 mJ m−2 and observe similar effects of alloying elements on γ SFE as those in Pt23X or Ni23X.}
