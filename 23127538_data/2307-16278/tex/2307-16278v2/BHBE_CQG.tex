\begin{abstract}
A model is proposed for the interior of a neutral non-rotating black hole. It consists of an ideal fluid with density 
$\r$ and a negative pressure $p$, obeying the equation of state $p=-\xi\r$. In order 
for the Einstein equation to have a solution, $\xi$
must lie in a narrow range between  0.1429  and 0.1716.

\section{Introduction}
The interior of a black hole is a mystery. When a star collapses into a black hole, its matter loses the
baryonic number, fermionic number, isotopic spin, hypercharge etc.,
to become a different kind of matter that shall be referred to as black hole matter. The nature of this new  matter 
is largely unknown, and its distribution
inside the black hole is also unknown, except that there is a singularity at the center  \cite{aK56, aR57, rP65, SG14, kL22} which can likely be washed out when quantum effect is taken into account \cite{mB07, aP17, ABP19, AQS23}. 

The property of this new matter is of considerable interest by itself. Moreover, its quantization might lead to a new understanding of the Hawking radiation. It might even be related to the inflaton matter before reheating because the latter presumably
also carries no global quantum numbers. However,
being inside the black hole, this new  matter cannot be  experimentally measured, so we must resort to theoretical modelling
guided and constraint by the Einstein equation to gain some understanding of it.

In this article we propose a simple model of black-hole matter, described by an ideal fluid with a positive mass density $\r$,
and an equation of state $p=-\xi\r$ with a negative pressure. To prevent matter from sinking to the center,
a repulsive force ($\xi>0$) produced by a negative pressure is required. In order to have a solution,  it turns out that only a very narrow range of $\xi$ between 0.1429  and 0.1716 is allowed. 
In this way the present model differs from those \cite{MM15, BMN19, MM23} where black-hole matter is made up of dark energy with $\xi=1$.
The density
and the metric of this model have a singularity at the origin as per the singularity theorem, but the internal mass in a finite volume
is finite and  vanishes as the volume goes to zero. 


\section{The Model}
We would like to construct a model of a spherical black hole 
whose interior space is filled with matter. Assuming there is nothing else in spacetime, the stress-energy-momentum tensor $T_{\m\n}$ is zero outside the black hole,
but it is non-zero inside where matter is. Black hole matter is assumed to be an ideal fluid with
\be T_{\m\n}=(p+\r)U_\m U_\n+p g_{\m\n}, \labels{semt}\ee
whose four-velocity is as usual normalized to $U^\m U_\m=-1$. The energy density $\r$ is assumed to be positive, but 
the pressure determined by the equation of state  $p=-\xi\r$ can be either positive ($\xi<0$) or negative ($\xi>0$) at this point. 

The metric outside such a black hole with mass $M$ is the Schwarzschild metric
\be ds^2&=&-\bigg(1-{2GM\over r}\bigg)dt^2+\bigg(1-{2GM\over r}\bigg)^{-1}dr^2+r^2 d\Omega^2.\ee
It obeys the Einstein equation $G_{\m\n}=8\pi GT_{\m\n}=0$, with the event horizon
located at $r=R=2GM$.


The metric inside is
given by the line element \cite{sC04}
\be ds^2&=&-e^{2\a(r)}dt^2+\bigg(1-{2Gm(r)\over r}\bigg)^{-1}dr^2+r^2 d\Omega^2.\labels{ds2}\ee
It obeys the Einstein equation $G_{\m\n}=8\pi GT_{\m\n}$, with  $T_{\m\n}$ given by 
\eq{semt}.


With this energy-momentum tensor,  Einstein equation is equivalent to the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation
for the pressure gradient  \cite{sC04, OV39} 
\be {dp\over dr}&=&-{(\r+p)[Gm(r)+4\pi Gr^3p]\over r[r-2Gm(r)]},\qquad {\rm where}\labels{dpdr}\\
m(r)&=&4\pi\int_0^r\r(r'){r'}^2dr'\labels{massr}\ee
is the mass of a black-hole matter ball of radius $r\le R$.
The  metric functions $\a$ obeys \cite{sC04}
\be {d\a\over dr}&=&-{1\over (\r+p)}{dp\over dr}.\labels{dadr}\ee

To match the inside of the black hole to the outside, we need to specify 
boundary conditions at $r=R$. Since $T_{\m\n}=0$ outside but non-zero inside, it
cannot be analytic at $r=R$, for otherwise it has to vanish inside as well. 
As a result, the functions specifying the metric cannot be analytic either.
Instead, we require continuity at the event horizon, namely,
\be m(R)=M,\quad p(R)=0,\quad \r(R)=0, \quad e^{2\a(R)}=0,\labels{bondc}\ee
and these conditions are sufficient for the Einstein equation inside the event horizon to have a solution.
 
For $R-r$ small and positive, \eq{dpdr}
can be approximated by
\be {dp\over dr}=-{(\r+p)GM\over R[r-2GM]}={\xi-1\over 2\xi}{p\over R-r},\quad (R-r\ll R),\labels{dpdrR}\ee
whose solution for small and positive $R-r$ is
\be p(r)\simeq -\tilde c(R-r)^{(1-\xi)/2\xi}\equiv -\tilde c(R-r)^\g \labels{pR}\ee
for some $\tilde c>0$. In order for $p(R)=0$, it is necessary to have $0<\xi<1$, so the black-hole matter necessarily carries
a negative pressure. 

Using \eq{dadr} and $p=-\xi\r$, one gets 
\be e^{2\a(r)}=c'\r(r)^{1/\g}\labels{e2a}\ee
for some $c'>0$. Thus $e^{2\a(r)}$ is positive throughout the interior of the black hole. In particular, when $r$ approaches
$R$, \eq{pR} shows that $e^{2\a(r)}\to c''(R-r)$ for some $c''>0$,  satisfying
the boundary condition in \eq{bondc}. 


It would be simpler to write the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation in a dimensionless form. To that end,
let $x=r/R,\ \bar m(x)=m(r)/M$, and $\bar \r(x)=\r(r)(R^3/M)$. Then \eq{dpdr} can be written as
\be
{d\bar \r(x)\over dx}&=&-{\xi-1\over 2\xi}{\bar \r(x)\over x}{\bar m(x)-4\pi\xi x^3\bar \r(x)\over x-\bar m(x)},\labels{dless1}\\
{d\bar m(x)\over dx}&=&4\pi x^2 \bar \r(x), \labels{dless2}\ee
with the boundary condition $\bar\r(1)=0$ and $\bar m(1)=1$. The interior solution equivalent to \eq{pR} near $x=1$ is then
\be
\bar \r(x)&\simeq& c(1-x)^{(1-\xi)/2\xi},\\
\bar m(x)&\simeq&1-{8\pi \xi c\over \xi+1}(1-x)^{(\xi+1)/2\xi},\qquad (1-x\ll 1)\label{solrm}\ee
for some $c>0$. 

Let us turn to the behavior near $x=0$. Assuming the mass function $\bar m(x)$ to increase
steadily from  0 to 1 in the interval $x\in(0,1)$, then for small $x$, $\bar m(x)=\m_0x^\b$ for some $\b>0$ and $\m_0>0$. It follows from \eq{dless1} that $\bar \r(x)=(\m_0\b/4\pi) x^{\b-3}$, so $x^3\bar \r(x)$ is proportional to $\bar m(x)$,
and  $\bar m(x)-4\pi\xi x^3\bar \r(x)=\bar m(x)(1-\b\xi)$.

If $\b>1$, then $x-\bar m(x)\simeq x$ for sufficiently small $x$, in which case the $x$-behavior
on both sides of \eq{dless1} can never match, so in order to have a solution,
we need to have $\b\le 1$. 
As a result, $\bar\r(x)\sim x^{\b-3}$ must diverge near $x=0$. \eq{dadr}  shows that  $e^{2\a}\simeq (\bar\r/\bar\r_0)^{2\xi/(1-\xi)}$, which also diverges near $x=0$, but it remains positive throughout
the interior of the black hole. To avoid another singularity between $x=0$ and $x=1$,
we must keep $2Gm(r)>r$, or $\bar m(x)>x$ in this range.
Hence the signature of the metric changes from $(-,+,+,+)$ outside the black hole to
$(-,-,+,+)$ inside, whereas the signature $(+,-,+,+)$ of the Schwarzschild metric   inside is that of a Kantowski-Sachs metric.

The presence of a singularity is hardly surprising \cite{aK56, aR57, rP65, kL22, SG14}. Using the Raydhuchaudri equation, it can be shown that a singularity is present at $r=0$ if the convergence condition
 $R_{\m\n}U^\m U^\n\ge 0$ is satisfied. In the present case, the Einstein equation
$R_{\m\n}-\h R g_{\m\n}=8\pi G T_{\m\n}$ implies 
$R_{\m\n}=8\pi G(T_{\m\n}-\h T^a_\a g_{\m\n})=8\pi G\[(p+\r)U_\m U_\n+\h(\r-p)g_{\m\n}\]$, hence
$R_{\m\n}U^\m U^\n=4\pi G\r(1-3\xi)$. With $\xi<1/3$, as shall be presently shown, the 
convergence condition is met so a singularity is present.

If $\b<1$, then $x-\bar m(x)\simeq -\bar m(x)$ for sufficiently small $x$, so \eq{dless1} is satisfied when
\be \b=(\-1 \+ 7 \xi)/\xi (1 \+ \xi).\labels{beta}\ee
In order for $\b$ to be between 0 and 1, $\xi$ is allowed only a narrow range of values between 
$\xi=1/7\simeq 0.1429$ (when $\b=0$) and  $\xi=3-2\sqrt{2}\simeq 0.1716$ (when $\b=1$).
For larger values of $\xi$, this formula yields $\b>1$, so it is not allowed. 



A numerical solution for $\xi=0.16$, somewhere in the middle of the allowed range, is shown in Fig.~1 as an illustration. 
This solution is obtained numerically by integrating \eq{dpdr} and \eq{massr}, starting at an initial $x$ so small that the approximation  $\bar m(x)=\m_0x^\b$ and $\bar \r(x)=(\m_0\b/4\pi) x^{\b-3}$ is accurate. The
value of $\b$ given by \eq{beta}, and the constant $\m_0$ is adjusted to yield $\bar m(1)=1$ and $\bar\r(1)=0$ at the
other boundary.

%\section{Temperature and Entropy}
%It is well known that a neutral and non-rotating black hole with mass $M$ satisfies the first law of black hole dynamics: $dM=(\kappa/8\pi G)dA$, where $\kappa$ is its surface
%gravity and $A$ is the area of its event horizon. Moreover, it is known that $\kappa$ is constant throughout
%the surface of the black hole and $A$ cannot decrease \cite{jB73, rW04}.
%These properties can be easily verified for a Schwarzschild black hole where $\kappa=GM/R^2$, $R=2GM$,  and $dA=8\pi RdR$.  
%
%The second law of thermodynamics says that the entropy $S_B$ of a thermal system cannot decrease. The fact that $A$ also cannot decrease suggests that maybe
%one can regard them to be the same. However,  $S_B$ is dimensionless and $A$
%is not, but  $A/G$ is indeed dimensionless in the units $\hbar=c=1$. This leads to the
%suggestion that if the black hole is considered a thermal system, then its entropy
%$S_B$ is proportional to $A/G$, namely, $S_B=A/G\zeta$ for some dimensionless
%constant $\zeta$. Next, the constancy of $\kappa$ on the black hole surface
%suggests that it can be interpreted as the temperature $T_B$ of the system, which
%is also a constant for a system in equilibrium. Moreover, $T_B$ and $\kappa$
%have the same dimension so they can be proportional. 
%If we let $T_B=\zeta\kappa/8\pi$, then the first law of
%black hole dynamics becomes the first law of thermodynamics with 
%$dM=(\kappa/8\pi G)dA=T_B dS_B$. This observation first discovered by 
%Bekenstein \cite{jB73} will be referred to  as the Bekenstein conjecture. 
%The subscripts $B$ for $T$ and $S$ are there to remind us of 
%their association with the conjecture. A more involved analysis can be found in \cite{bD11}. 
%
%Since the black hole mass $M$ is the black hole energy seen by an observer at infinity,
%both $T_B$ and $S_B$ must also refer to quantities measured by the same observer
%in order for this conjecture to make sense. 
%
%There is however one caveat about this interesting observation. A classical black hole
%emits no radiation so its temperature must be zero \cite{rW84}, which implies $\zeta=0$. Only when quantum effect is taken into account that we may have
%$\zeta\not=0$. Like the Bohr atom which is a mixture of classical and quantum
%physics, in the absence of a complete quantum gravity theory this conjecture from classical relativity is nowadays taken seriously
%assuming  somehow that $\zeta\not=0$. We shall continue our discussion below
%with this view in mind.
%
%First law of thermodynamics actually states that $dM=T_BdS_B-dW$, with $dW$ being 
%the work done by the black hole. In a Kerr black hole with spin, one can indeed 
%associate a $dW$ term with the change of its spin. In a Schwarzschild 
%black hole where vacuum is present on both sides of the event horizon, 
%there is  no pressure so there is  no
%mechanism for the black hole to do work. In that case it is reasonable to assume $dW=0$, which is the
%Bekenstein conjecture. However, if the black hole interior is filled with matter with a pressure, then  pressure will do work when  $dV=4\pi R^2dR=8\pi GR^2 dM$. One would then expect $dW>0$ when the pressure is positive,
%and $dW<0$ when the pressure is negative. Furthermore,
%in a model with no additional dimensional parameters,   on dimensional grounds $dW$ must be proportional to $T_BdS$, so the first law of thermodynamics, including
%the work term, can be written as $dM=\lambda T_BdS_B$, with $\lambda=1$ when $dW=0$, $\lambda<1$ when the pressure inside the black hole is positive, and $\lambda>1$ when the pressure inside is negative. We shall refer to that as the
%modified Bekenstein conjecture.
%
%With the model of  black hole interior discussed in Sec.~II, the amount of pressure
%inside the black hole is known, so one can hope to obtain what $\lambda$ is.
%We shall see below that  the result is $\lambda=1/(1-\xi)$.
%
%
%
%%Their similarity  with the first and second laws of thermodynamics led Bekenstein \cite{jB73} to propose that
%%the black-hole entropy $S_B$ is proportional to $A$, and the black-hole temperature $T_B$ is proportional to $\kappa$,
%%and that the first law of black-hole dynamics $dM=(\kappa/8\pi G)dA$ can be interpreted as the first law of thermodynamics
%%$dM=T_BdS_B$. This can be achieved if $T_B=\zeta\kappa/8\pi$ and $S=A/G\zeta$
%%for some dimensionless parameter $\zeta$ (in the unit $\hbar=c=1$). A more involved analysis can be found in \cite{bD11}. 
%
%%Since temperature does not usually enter into the Einstein equations, this identification with the first law of thermodynamics can be regarded only as a conjecture within classical relativity.
%%In fact, it is worse than that because the black hole emits no radiation so its temperature $T_B$ should be zero \cite{rW84}, which implies $\zeta=0$. Following
%%much of the literature, we shall disregard this problem and continue our discussion
%%on the conjecture and its possible modification.
%
%
%
%
%%
%%Using the first law of thermodynamics,  one can 
%%conjecture more broadly that $dM=(\kappa/8\pi G)dA=T_BdS_B-dW$, where $dW$ is work done
%%by the black hole. In the case of a Schwarzschild
%%black hole, vacuum is inside and outside the black hole. There is  no pressure, so there is  no
%%mechanism for the black hole to do work. In that case it is reasonable to assume $dW=0$, which is the
%%Bekenstein conjecture. However, if the black hole interior is filled with matter with a pressure, then the pressure will do work to expand the volume by an amount $dV=4\pi R^2dR=8\pi GR^2 dM$, thereby rendering  $dW\not=0$. One would expect $dW>0$ when the pressure is positive,
%%and $dW<0$ when the pressure is negative.
%%In a model with no additional dimensional parameters,   on dimensional grounds $dW$ must be proportional to $T_BdS$, so the broader Bekenstein conjecture including work done could be written as $dM=\lambda T_BdS_B$, with $\lambda=1$ when $dW=0$, $\lambda<1$ when the pressure inside the black hole is positive, and $\lambda>1$ when the pressure inside is negative.
%%
%%
%%
%%However, if  the interior structure of the black hole is known and is a thermodynamical system, 
%%then  temperature,
%%entropy, as well as pressure and density can be computed, and the  Bekenstein's conjecture can be verified.
%%We shall do so below assuming the interior of the black hole to consist of the black-hole matter discussed in the last section.
%Let us now turn to the black matter model discussed in Sec.~II.
% Let $S(r)$ be the entropy of a ball of black hole matter with radius $r\le R$, and $T(r)$ be its surface temperature. 
% Since $T$ has the dimension of $1/r$ (in $\hbar=c=1$ units) and $S$ is dimensionless, namely of the dimension
% $r^2/G$, it follows that $T^2(r)S(r)G:=\eta$ is dimensionless. We shall assume $\eta$ to be a universal constant, independent of 
% the black-hole size $R$, or $r$. This is the basic assumption on the thermal property
% of the black hole matter.
% 
% The amount of heat flowing into the black-energy ball can be computed from
% the first law of thermodynamics to be
%\be T(r)dS(r)=dm(r)+p(r)(4\pi r^2dr)=4\pi r^2\[\r(r)+p(r)\]dr=(1-\xi)4\pi r^2\r(r)dr.\labels{firstlaw}\ee
%Using $T(r)=\sqrt{\eta/GS(r)}$ so that $T(r)dS(r)=2\sqrt{\eta/G}\ d\(\sqrt{S(r)}\)$, we can integrate
%the first law from $r=0$ to $r=R$. Assuming $S(0)=0$, one gets $\sqrt{4\eta/G}\ \sqrt{S(R)}=(1-\xi)M$,
%which implies 
%\be S(R)&=&{(1-\xi)^2\over 4\eta}GM^2={(1-\xi)^2\over 16\pi \eta}{A\over 4G},\\
% T(R)&=&\sqrt{{\eta\over GS(R)}}={2\eta\over 1-\xi}{1\over GM}={16\pi\eta\over 1-\xi}{1\over 4\pi R}.\labels{tint}\ee
%If we make the identification $T_B=T(R)$ and $S_B=S(R)$, then
%\be T_B dS_B=(1-\xi)dM,\labels{TdS}\ee
%which satisfies the modified Bekenstein conjecture with $\lambda=1/(1-\xi)$.
%
%There is an unknown parameter $\zeta$ in the Bekenstein temperature $T_B$
%and there is an unknown parameter $\eta$ in \eq{tint}. If we make the identification
%$T(R)=T_B$, then since $\kappa=GM/R^2=1/2R$, the two parameters are related by
%$\eta=\zeta(1-\xi)/64\pi$. 
% 
% With $\sqrt{S(r)}=(1-\xi)(G/4\eta)^\h\  \bar m(r)$, and $\b<1$, $\bar m(r)$ and $S(r)$ rise fairly quickly
% with $r$, as illustrated in Fig.~1. Although $S_H$ is proportional to the surface area $A$, this model
% is not holographic because entropy as well as dynamical degrees of freedom are spread throughout the volume, rather than being concentrated on the surface of the black hole.
