%% Abstract section.
\abstract{
  We present InvVis, a new approach for invertible visualization, which is reconstructing or further modifying a visualization from an image. InvVis 
  allows the embedding of a significant amount of data, such as chart data, chart information, source code, etc., into visualization images. 
  The encoded image is perceptually indistinguishable from the original one. We propose a new method to efficiently express chart data in the form of 
  images, enabling large-capacity data embedding. We also outline a model based on the invertible neural network to achieve high-quality data concealing 
  and revealing. We explore and implement a variety of application scenarios of InvVis. Additionally, we conduct a series of evaluation experiments to 
  assess our method from multiple perspectives, including data embedding quality, data restoration accuracy, data encoding capacity, etc. The result of our 
  experiments demonstrates the great potential of InvVis in invertible visualization.

    Since InvVis can embed a large amount of data into images, users can decode the embedded data and perform 
    rich exploration, such as redesigning (a) or reconstructing (b) visualizations, rebuilding a visualization dashboard 
    based on the decoded source code and chart data (c), or visualizing volume data based on the decoded raw data 
    and rendering parameters (d).
