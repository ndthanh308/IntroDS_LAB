  "abstract": "With the advent of unprecedented collision energy at the Large Hadron Collider, CERN, Geneva, a new domain of particle production and possible formation of Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) in high-multiplicity proton-proton collisions and the collisions of light nuclei has been a much-discussed topic recently. In this review, I discuss some of the recent observations leading to such a possibility, associated challenges, and some predictions for the upcoming light-nuclei collisions at the LHC.",
