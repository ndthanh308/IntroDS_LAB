  "abstract": "Epidemiological models are an important tool in coping with epidemics, as they offer a forecast, even if often simplistic, of the behavior of the disease in the population. This allows responsible health agencies to organize themselves and adopt strategies to minimize and postpone the population's infection peaks. While during an epidemic outbreak, the available model can be used to describe the behavior of the disease in order to aim for fast and efficient forecasts of the epidemiological scenario, once the epidemiological emergency is over, the objective of the subsequent works is to extend models by integrating new facts and information, thus providing more efficient tools to face future epidemics. In this sense, we present an epidemiological model that takes into account on one hand, the creation of a vaccine during an epidemic outbreak (as we saw happen in the case of COVID-19) and that, on the other hand, considers the impact of the cooperative behavioral choices of individuals.",
