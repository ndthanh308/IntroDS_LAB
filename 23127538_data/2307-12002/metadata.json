  "abstract": "We have studied the effect of the nonextensive Tsallis mechanism on the viscous properties of hot QCD matter in the presence of a strong magnetic field. The results are compared to the case of absence of magnetic field. The viscous coefficients, such as the shear viscosity ($η$) and the bulk viscosity ($ζ$) are determined in the similar environment by utilizing the nonextensive Tsallis mechanism within the relaxation time approximation of kinetic theory. We have observed that, when the nonextensive parameter $q$ is just above unity, both shear and bulk viscosities get increased as compared to their counterparts at $q=1$. This enhancement in viscosities is more evident in the additional presence of a strong magnetic field. Furthermore, some observables pertaining to the flow characteristic, fluid behavior and conformal symmetry of the medium are also explored.",
