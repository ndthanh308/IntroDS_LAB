  "abstract": "In the present paper, we study the geometry of certain classes of null submanifolds of indefinite complex contact manifolds. In particular, we show that quaternion null submanifolds are always totally geodesic. We also present the geometry of distributions on screen real and screen transversal anti-invariant submanifolds.",
