  "abstract": "Blockchain-based decentralized identity management provides a promising solution to improve the security and privacy of healthcare systems and make them scalable. Traditional Identity Management Systems are centralized, which makes them single-point-of-failure, vulnerable to attacks and data breaches, and non-scalable. In contrast, decentralized identity management based on the blockchain can ensure secure and transparent access to patient data while preserving privacy. This approach enables patients to control their personal health data while granting permission for medical personnel to access specific information as needed. We propose a decentralized identity management system for healthcare systems named BDIMHS based on a permissioned blockchain with Hyperledger Indy and Hyperledger Aries. We develop further descriptions of required functionalities and provide high-level procedures for network initialization, enrollment, registration, issuance, verification and revocation functionalities. The proposed solution improves data security, privacy, immutability, interoperability, and patient autonomy by using selective disclosure, zero-knowledge proofs, Decentralized Identifiers, and Verifiable Credentials. Furthermore, we discuss the potential challenges associated with implementing this technology in healthcare and evaluate the performance and security of the proposed solution.",
