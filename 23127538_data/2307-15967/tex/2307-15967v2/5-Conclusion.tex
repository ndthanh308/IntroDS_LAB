\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we present mapping-aware graph condensation (MCond), a novel graph condensation approach that expands the capabilities of the synthetic graph beyond the preservation of GNN training. By introducing a mapping matrix, MCond empowers the synthetic graph seamlessly integrate new nodes into the synthetic graph for inductive representation learning. Extensive experimentation demonstrates the efficacy of MCond in facilitating fast inductive inference across various GNN architectures. 
Moreover, the generated synthetic graph and mapping matrix successfully capture valuable structural information, resulting in further performance enhancements through efficient label propagation and error propagation.
Although the flexibility and compatibility of MCond enable its integration with the graph condensation method, it is important to acknowledge that the performance of our method is significantly influenced by the quality of the graph condensation results. Thus, as a direction for future work, it would be valuable to explore strategies that enhance the robustness of graph condensation for variations in large-scale datasets.
