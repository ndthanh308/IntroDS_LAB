Such theories are dubbed transverse, and diﬀer from General Relativity in that the determinant of the metric, g, is a transverse scalar. We comment on diverse ways in which these models can be constrained using a variety of observations. Generically, an additional scalar degree of freedom mediates the interaction, so the usual constraints on scalar-tensor theories have to be imposed. If the purely gravitational part is Einstein–Hilbert but the matter action is transverse, the models predict that the three a priori diﬀerent concepts of mass (gravitational active and gravitational passive as well as inertial) are not equivalent anymore. These transverse deviations from General Relativity are therefore tightly constrained, actually correlated with existing bounds on violations of the equivalence principle, local violations of Newton’s third law and/or violation of Local Position Invariance.},

	abstract = {Unimodular Gravity is an alternative to General Relativity (GR) which, however, is so closely related to the latter that one can wonder to what extent they are different. The different behavior of the cosmological constant in the semiclassical regimes of both frameworks suggests the possible existence of additional contrasting features. UG and GR are based on two different gauge symmetries: UG is based on transverse diffeomorphisms and Weyl rescalings (WTDiff transformations), whereas GR is based on the full group of diffeomorphisms. This difference is related to the existence of a fiduciary background structure, a fixed volume form, in UG theories. In this work we present an overview as complete as possible of situations and regimes in which one might suspect that some differences between these two theories might arise. This overview contains analyses in the classical, semiclassical, and quantum regimes. When a particular situation is well known we make just a brief description of its status. For situations less analyzed in the literature we provide here more complete analyses. Whereas some of these analyses are sparse through the literature, many of them are new. Apart from the completely different treatment they provide for the cosmological constant problem, our results uncover no further differences between them. We conclude that, to the extent that the technical naturalness of the cosmological constant is regarded as a fundamental open issue in modern physics, UG is preferred over GR since the cosmological constant is technically natural in the former.},

We then list the various types of singularities that can occur from its presence. We also discuss the possibility that phantom behavior is mimicked by an alternative theory of gravity.

	abstract = {Apart from the familiar structure firmly-rooted in the general relativistic field equations where the energy--momentum tensor has a null divergence i.e., it conserves, there exists a considerable number of extended theories of gravity allowing departures from the usual conservative framework. Many of these theories became popular in the last few years, aiming to describe the phenomenology behind dark matter and dark energy. However, within these scenarios, it is common to see attempts to preserve the conservative property of the energy--momentum tensor. Most of the time, it is done by means of some additional constraint that ensures the validity of the standard conservation law, as long as this option is available in the theory. However, if no such extra constraint is available, the theory will inevitably carry a non-trivial conservation law as part of its structure. In this work, we review some of such proposals discussing the theoretical construction leading to the non-conservation of the energy--momentum tensor.},

With previous data from our High-Z Supernova Search Team, this expanded set of 16 high-redshift supernovae and 34 nearby supernovae are used to place constraints on the Hubble constant (H\_0), the mass density (Omega\_M), the cosmological constant (Omega\_Lambda), the deceleration parameter (q\_0), and the dynamical age of the Universe (t\_0). The distances of the high-redshift SNe Ia are, on average, 10\% to 15\% farther than expected in a low mass density (Omega\_M=0.2) Universe without a cosmological constant. Different light curve fitting methods, SN Ia subsamples, and prior constraints unanimously favor eternally expanding models with positive cosmological constant (i.e., Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater} 0) and a current acceleration of the expansion (i.e., q\_0 {\textless} 0). With no prior constraint on mass density other than Omega\_M {\textgreater} 0, the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia are consistent with q\_0 {\textless}0 at the 2.8 sigma and 3.9 sigma confidence levels, and with Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma and 4.0 sigma confidence levels, for two fitting methods respectively. Fixing a ``minimal'' mass density, Omega\_M=0.2, results in the weakest detection, Omega\_Lambda{\textgreater}0 at the 3.0 sigma confidence level. For a flat-Universe prior (Omega\_M+Omega\_Lambda=1), the spectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia require Omega\_Lambda {\textgreater}0 at 7 sigma and 9 sigma level for the two fitting methods. A Universe closed by ordinary matter (i.e., Omega\_M=1) is ruled out at the 7 sigma to 8 sigma level. We estimate the size of systematic errors, including evolution, extinction, sample selection bias, local flows, gravitational lensing, and sample contamination. Presently, none of these effects reconciles the data with Omega\_Lambda=0 and q\_0 {\textgreater} 0.},

	abstract = {We report measurements of the mass density, Omega\_M, and cosmological-constant energy density, Omega\_Lambda, of the universe based on the analysis of 42 Type Ia supernovae discovered by the Supernova Cosmology Project. The magnitude-redshift data for these SNe, at redshifts between 0.18 and 0.83, are fit jointly with a set of SNe from the Calan/Tololo Supernova Survey, at redshifts below 0.1, to yield values for the cosmological parameters. All SN peak magnitudes are standardized using a SN Ia lightcurve width-luminosity relation. The measurement yields a joint probability distribution of the cosmological parameters that is approximated by the relation 0.8 Omega\_M - 0.6 Omega\_Lambda {\textasciitilde}= -0.2 +/- 0.1 in the region of interest (Omega\_M {\textless}{\textasciitilde} 1.5). For a flat (Omega\_M + Omega\_Lambda = 1) cosmology we find Omega\_M = 0.28\{+0.09,-0.08\} (1 sigma statistical) \{+0.05,-0.04\} (identified systematics). The data are strongly inconsistent with a Lambda = 0 flat cosmology, the simplest inflationary universe model. An open, Lambda = 0 cosmology also does not fit the data well: the data indicate that the cosmological constant is non-zero and positive, with a confidence of P(Lambda {\textgreater} 0) = 99\%, including the identified systematic uncertainties. The best-fit age of the universe relative to the Hubble time is t\_0 = 14.9\{+1.4,-1.1\} (0.63/h) Gyr for a flat cosmology. The size of our sample allows us to perform a variety of statistical tests to check for possible systematic errors and biases. We find no significant differences in either the host reddening distribution or Malmquist bias between the low-redshift Calan/Tololo sample and our high-redshift sample. The conclusions are robust whether or not a width-luminosity relation is used to standardize the SN peak magnitudes.},

In many models, this kinetically driven inﬂation (or “k-inﬂation” for short) rolls slowly from a high-curvature initial phase, down to a low-curvature phase and can exit inﬂation to end up being radiationdominated, in a naturally graceful manner. We hope that this novel inﬂation mechanism might be useful in suggesting new ways of reconciling the string dilaton with inﬂation.},

We define what a ghost field is and we show that its presence is associated to a classical instability whenever the ghost field interacts with standard fields. We then show that the instability is more severe at quantum level, and that perturbative ghosts can exist only in low energy effective theories. However, if we don’t consider very ad-hoc choices, compatibility with observational constraints implies that low energy effective ghosts can exist only at the price of giving up Lorentz-invariance or locality above the cut-off, in which case the cut-off has to be much lower that the energy scales we currently probe in particle colliders. We also comment on the possible role of extra degrees of freedom which break Lorentz-invariance spontaneously.},

We start with cases where the DE only directly aﬀects the background evolution, considering Taylor expansions of the equation of state w(a), as well as principal component analysis and parameterizations related to the potential of a minimally coupled DE scalar ﬁeld. When estimating the density of DE at early times, we signiﬁcantly improve present constraints and ﬁnd that it has to be below ≈ 2 \% (at 95\% conﬁdence) of the critical density even when forced to play a role for z {\textless} 50 only. We then move to general parameterizations of the DE or MG perturbations that encompass both eﬀective ﬁeld theories and the phenomenology of gravitational potentials in MG models. Lastly, we test a range of speciﬁc models, such as k-essence, f (R) theories and coupled DE. In addition to the latest Planck data, for our main analyses we use background constraints from baryonic acoustic oscillations, type-Ia supernovae and local measurements of the Hubble constant. We further show the impact of measurements of the cosmological perturbations, such as redshift-space distortions and weak gravitational lensing. These additional probes are important tools for testing MG models and for breaking degeneracies that are still present in the combination of Planck and background data sets.},

In contrast, it is possible to develop non-standard energy conditions that are intrinsically non-linear in the stress-energy tensor, and which exhibit much better well-controlled behaviour when semi-classical quantum eﬀects are introduced, at the cost of a less direct applicability to geodesic focussing. In this chapter we will ﬁrst review the standard energy conditions and their various limitations. (Including the connection to the Hawking–Ellis type I, II, III, and IV classiﬁcation of stress-energy tensors). We shall then turn to the averaged, nonlinear, and semi-classical energy conditions, and see how much can be done once semi-classical quantum eﬀects are included.},

	abstract = {Galileon models are among the most appealing candidates for Dark Energy. The reason is twofold: classically, they provide a tracking solution leading to an almost DeSitter space starting from very generic initial conditions in the deep radiation era. The second reason is the standard lore that Galileons are quantum mechanically stable. The latter property is certainly true in ﬂat space-time, thanks to the non-renormalization theorems of galilean coupling constants. However, in a cosmological background, we show that quantum eﬀects might dominate the classical trajectory. Assuming the radiation era to last at least up to the electroweak phase transition, the trajectory with initial conditions sitting on the tracker is ruled out. On the other hand, it is always possible to ﬁnd a sub-space of initial conditions such that the dark energy solution approaches stably the tracker at late times. Fixing the value of initial conditions that best ﬁt current data, and assuming that the galileon eﬀective theory is valid up to the beginning of the radiation epoch, we found that the reheating temperature of the universe cannot be larger than 108 GeV. Reversing the argument, if dark energy will turn out to be in form of Galileons, the bounds by EUCLID on the initial conditions for these models will also be a bound on the reheating temperature of our Universe.},

The solution avoids fine-tuning of parameters and anthropic arguments. Instead, k-essence is based on the idea of a dynamical attractor solution which causes it to act as a cosmological constant only at the onset of matter-domination. Consequently, k-essence overtakes the matter density and induces cosmic acceleration at about the present epoch. In this paper, we present the basic theory of k-essence and dynamical attractors based on evolving scalar fields with non-linear kinetic energy terms in the action. We present guidelines for constructing concrete examples and show that there are two classes of solutions, one in which cosmic acceleration continues forever and one in which the acceleration has finite duration.},
