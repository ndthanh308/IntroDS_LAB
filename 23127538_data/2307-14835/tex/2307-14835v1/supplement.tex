\section{Refined Simple Update Scheme for Next-nearest Neighbor Models}
\label{RefinedSU}
\vspace{-2pt}

In our research, we implement a refined version of simple update based on \cite{Corboz2010-PEPS-NNN}, which leads to tremendous speedup of the algorithm. The update of the nearest neighbor (NN) terms (including on-site) is the same as described in \cite{Corboz2010-PEPS-NN}. We modified the NNN update scheme, in a manner suggested by Andreas Weichselbaum as shown in Fig.~\ref{SUDiagram}, for further processing.

The major improvement comes from the separation of indices directly involved in the update from the other \emph{spectator} indices not involved in the update. Figure \ref{SUDetails} shows the details for treating the diagram in Fig.~\ref{SUDiagram}(b). The other diagrams can be performed analogously. Greek letters $\alpha,\beta,\ldots$ label the physical indices. Figure \ref{SUDetails}(a) describes the construction of tensor $\varDelta_L$ and the application of corresponding swap gates. Then, we split off the relevant physical and auxiliary indices via singular value decomposition (SVD). Next, we perform analogous actions for $\varDelta_R$ as depicted in Fig.~\ref{SUDetails}(b). These procedures generate tensors $L$ and $R$ of size $Dd×D×d$, where $D$ is the bond dimension of the auxiliary index and $d$ the dimension of local Hilbert space. Hereafter, we apply the Trotter gate, as in Fig.~\ref{SUDetails}(c), and obtain the updated tensors $L'$ and $R'$ via truncated SVD. Then, we restore the original $\varGamma$-$\varLambda$ structure via truncated SVD as shown in Fig.~\ref{SUDetails}(d). Finally, we update all the involved $\varGamma$ and $\varLambda$ tensors as described in Fig.~\ref{SUDetails}(e). The last two steps recover the original structure in Fig.~\ref{SUDiagram}(b).

The refined simple update scheme has a much better scaling behavior with respect to the bond dimension $D$. The original version of NNN simple update \cite{Corboz2010-PEPS-NNN} involves an SVD of complexity $O(D^{11}d^4)$, which is also the dominant contribution to the total complexity of the algorithm. In our refined scheme, the dominant complexity comes from the SVD in Fig.~\ref{SUDetails}(a), which scales as $O(D^7d^3)$, much lower than the complexity of the original simple update scheme.

\section{Technical Details of the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ iPEPS Simulations}
\label{Technical}
\vspace{-2pt}

Our computations start with a random initial iPEPS tensor network state written in the $\varGamma$-$\varLambda$ form \cite{Corboz2010-PEPS-NN}. The ground state is attained by repeatedly applying the projector $\exp\{-\tau(\mathcal{H}+\mu N)\}$ ($\tau$ is a small number, $\mathcal{H}$ the Hamiltonian \eqref{Hamiltonian}, $\mu$ the chemical potential and $N$ the charge density) to the initial state. The application is broken into a sequence of projectors involving only NN or NNN terms via Suzuki-Trotter decomposition. The Trotter error is of order $O(\tau^2)$. Therefore, we start with a large $\tau$ in the beginning so as to approach the ground state quickly, followed by a gradual decrease of $\tau$ to improve the accuracy.

Empirically, we find $\tau=0.1$ a fairly good starting point. During the update iteration, we measure the expectation value of the Trotter gate and compute an estimation of the ground state energy, which serves as an indicator of convergence. $\tau$ is reduced by half once the decrease of estimated ground state energy in an update step drops below $\tau^2$. We regard the convergence to be reached when $\tau$ drops below the threshold of $10^{-3}$. 

The optimization starts with $D=2$ for $\mathrm{U}(1)$ iPEPS and $D^*=2$ for $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ iPEPS. After reaching convergence at the fixed bond dimension, we increment $D$ or $D^*$ by $1$ (but see also Sec.~\ref{Guidance}), until we arrive at $D\!=\!12$ for $\mathrm{U}(1)$ or $D^*\!=\!7$ for $\mathrm{SU}(2)$. A preliminary ground state is obtained for some specific chemical potential $\mu_0$, which serves as the initialization of the optimization for all other values of $\mu$.

The symmetry bookkeeping of the tensors %involved 
in our algorithm is managed via the QSpace tensor library \cite{Weichselbaum2012-QSpace,Weichselbaum2012-QSpace-XSymbols,osqspacev4}. The QSpace library implements a series of tensor operations (e.g. contraction, SVD, etc.) that handle the propagation of symmetries. Therefore, we are able to use identical codes for both our $\mathrm{U}(1)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ iPEPS, differing only in the initialization where symmetries are designated. This guarantees the equal reliability of our iPEPS implementation with different symmetries.

The accurate contraction and measurement of the observables are performed via the Corner Transfer Matrix Renormalization Group (CTMRG) scheme \cite{Corboz&Vidal2011-tJ-PEPS&DMRG,Corboz2014-tJ-PEPS,Bruognolo2020-iPEPS-Review}, which generates a series of environmental tensors. The convergence of the ground state energies $\eA+\mu N$ and $\eS+\mu N$ with respect to environmental bond dimension $\chi$ for $\mathrm{U}(1)$ iPEPS or $\chi^*$ for $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ iPEPS is shown in Fig.~\ref{Convergence}. We find that they already reach sufficient convergence at $\chi=80$ and $\chi^*=50$. For safety, we set $\chi$ is set to be $\chi=144$ and $\chi^*=100$ in the main text.


\section{Benchmark}
\label{BenchmarkSection}

In this section, we present benchmarks of our $\mathrm{U}(1)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ iPEPS algorithms for an exactly solvable free-fermion model. The Hamiltonian reads:
%
\begin{equation}
\label{FFSModel}
\begin{split} % \raisetag{42pt}
    \mathcal{H} &= -\tnn \sum_{\langle i,j\rangle,\sigma} \left[ c^\dagger_{i\sigma} c_{j\sigma} + \gamma \Delta_{ij} + \text{h.c.}\right] \\
    &\;\; - \tnnn\!\! \sum_{\langle\!\langle i,j\rangle\!\rangle,\sigma} \left[ c^\dagger_{i\sigma} c_{j\sigma} + \gamma \Delta_{ij} + \text{h.c.}\right] + \mu \sum_{i,\sigma} c^\dagger_{i\sigma} c_{i\sigma},
\end{split}
\end{equation}
%
where \vspace{-2pt}
%
\begin{equation}
    \Delta_{ij} = c_{i\uparrow} c_{j\downarrow} - c_{i\downarrow} c_{j\uparrow},
\end{equation}
%
$\tnn$ and $\tnnn$ are the nearest and next-nearest neighbor hopping amplitude, $\gamma$ the singlet pairing potential, and $\mu$ the chemical potential. The ground state energy can be computed via a Fourier transform followed by a Bogoliubov transform:
%
\begin{equation}
\vspace{2.5pt}
\begin{aligned}
    e_0 &= \sum_\mathbf{k} \left[\xi_\mathbf{k} - \sqrt{\xi_\mathbf{k}^2 + \Delta_\mathbf{k}^2}\right],\\
    \xi_\mathbf{k} &= \mu - 2\tnn(\cos\mathbf{k}\!\cdot\!\mathbbm{1}_\mathrm{x} + \cos\mathbf{k}\!\cdot\!\mathbbm{1}_\mathrm{y})\\ &\qquad - 2 \tnnn(\cos\mathbf{k}\!\cdot\!\mathbbm{1}_\mathrm{d} + \cos\mathbf{k}\!\cdot\!\mathbbm{1}_\mathrm{o}), \\
    \Delta_\mathbf{k} &= 2\gamma\tnn(\cos\mathbf{k}\!\cdot\!\mathbbm{1}_\mathrm{x} + \cos\mathbf{k}\!\cdot\!\mathbbm{1}_\mathrm{y})\\ &\: + 2 \gamma \tnnn(\cos\mathbf{k}\!\cdot\!\mathbbm{1}_\mathrm{d} + \cos\mathbf{k}\!\cdot\!\mathbbm{1}_\mathrm{o}),
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
and $\mathbbm{1}_\mathrm{x}$, $\mathbbm{1}_\mathrm{y}$, $\mathbbm{1}_\mathrm{d}$, $\mathbbm{1}_\mathrm{o}$ are the unit vectors of horizontal, vertical, diagonal and off-diagonal directions, respectively. In all our benchmarks, we set $t=1$ and $\gamma=1$. And the analytical numerics are performed on a 100×100 finite size lattice, which suffices to approximate the thermodynamic limit with a double precision accuracy.

In the case of $\gamma=1$, the dispersion relation $E_\mathbf{k} = \sqrt{\xi_\mathbf{k}^2 + \Delta_\mathbf{k}^2}$ has a simpler form 
%
\begin{equation}
    E_\mathbf{k} = \sqrt{(\mu - \Delta_\mathbf{k})^2 + \Delta_\mathbf{k}^2},
\end{equation}
%
which exhibits a \emph{Mexican hat} shape, as depicted in Fig.~\ref{Dispersion}. The minimum of the dispersion relation satisfies $\partial_\mathbf{k} E_\mathbf{k} = 0$. For $0\!<\!\mu\!\leqslant\!8$, this condition leads to $\mu = 2\Delta_\mathbf{k}$, which yields an energy gap
%
\begin{equation}
    \label{egap}
    \Delta_E = \mu / \sqrt{2}
\end{equation}
%
Therefore, the energy gap grows as the chemical potential increases. Also, we can calculate analytically the average charge density $n_0$ and singlet pairing amplitude $\Delta_s$:
%
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    n_0 &= \sum_{\mathbf{k}}\left[ 1 - \frac{\xi_\mathbf{k}}{\sqrt{\xi_\mathbf{k}^2 + \Delta_\mathbf{k}^2}}\right], \\
    \Delta_s &= \sum_{\mathbf{k}} \Delta^\mathrm{nn}_\mathbf{k} \cdot \frac{\Delta_\mathbf{k}}{2\sqrt{\xi_\mathbf{k}^2 + \Delta_\mathbf{k}^2}},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
%
where
%
\begin{equation}
    \Delta^\mathrm{nn}_\mathbf{k} = 2\gamma\tnn(\cos\mathbf{k}\!\cdot\!\mathbbm{1}_\mathrm{x} + \cos\mathbf{k}\!\cdot\!\mathbbm{1}_\mathrm{y})
\end{equation}

Benchmark results for the $\mathrm{U}(1)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ iPEPS algorithms are depicted in Fig.~\ref{Benchmark}, demonstrating their errors relative to the aforementioned analytical values on a 2×2 supercell with $D=9$ and $D^*[D] = 6[9]$, respectively. The analysis incorporates four selected values of $\tnnn = \pm0.2, \pm0.4$, and for each $\tnnn$ value, the chemical potential is varied from $\mu=1$ to $8$.

As the chemical potential increases, there is a discernible enhancement in the accuracy of both the $\mathrm{U}(1)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ iPEPS algorithms. This improvement can be attributed to the increase of the energy gap in proportion to the chemical potential, as described by Eq.~(\ref{egap}). An increased energy gap implies diminished long-range correlations, thereby enabling the ground state properties to be better encoded within an iPEPS ansatz at a limited bond dimension.

The $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry is an inherent characteristic of the ground state of this free-fermion model. Thus, the errors produced by both the $\mathrm{U}(1)$ and $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ iPEPS are comparable. However, in certain instances, the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ iPEPS demonstrates a marginally superior accuracy, which can likely be attributed to the additional $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry constraint that aids in better approximating the true $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetric ground state. For large chemical potential, the accuracies of both algorithms reach $10^{-4}$, corroborating the efficacy of the algorithms.


\section{Guided and Unguided $\mathrm{U}(1)$ iPEPS Simulations}
\label{Guidance}

As a mathematical construction, the $\mathrm{U}(1)$ iPEPS ansatz encompasses a larger parameter space compared to the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ iPEPS ansatz at the same virtual bond dimensions, since the former is subject to fewer symmetry constraints. Consequently, it might be simplistically perceived that the $\mathrm{U}(1)$ iPEPS should be capable of capturing $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetric states for the parameter regime where the ground states retain $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry. Yet, from a pragmatic perspective, the $\mathrm{U}(1)$ iPEPS rarely converges to an $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetric state. This section aims to provide theoretical insights into this artifact.

\label{DDTable}
\end{minipage}
\end{table}

During the optimization of tensor networks, specific strategies are usually implemented to foster a more efficient approximation of the ground state. Concretely, the usual approach commences with a small bond dimension $D$, e.g. $D\!=\!2$, followed by optimization to convergence, prior to incrementing $D$ until the pre-determined maximum $D$ is reached. The primary rationale behind this strategy is the circumvention of potential local minimums in the expansive parameter space spanned by a large $D$. Nevertheless, this strategy engenders complications when searching through the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetric subspace.

In the course of conducting our $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ iPEPS simulations, we have identified a distinct relationship between the number of kept multiplets $D^*$ and the corresponding bond dimension $D$. Particularly, in the context of the $\tnn$-$\tnnn$ Hubbard model, the $D^*$-$D$ correspondence and the details of the symmetry sectors are delineated in Table \ref{DDTable}.

A perusal of the table reveals that not all choices of $D$ are congruous with the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry. In other words, if one carries out an optimization at $D_u\!=\!2,5,8,10,11,\cdots$ (the $D$ values not in Table~\ref{DDTable}), the resulting ground state is invariably destined to violate the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry. Hence, should one want to preserve of $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry within a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ iPEPS algorithm, the optimization process should be conducted exclusively following the sequence $D_g\!=\!1,3,4,6,7,9,12,\cdots$. We refer to this approach as \emph{guided} $\mathrm{U}(1)$ optimization. Conversely, should one traverse the entire sequence $D\!=\!1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,\cdots$, the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetry is assured to be broken. We thus refer to this method as \emph{unguided} $\mathrm{U}(1)$ optimization.

% \setcounter{figure}{3}
% Figure environment removed

Figure \ref{GE22} shows the ground state energy per site obtained from both guided and unguided $\mathrm{U}(1)$ iPEPS on the 2×2 supercells, in conjunction with the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ iPEPS on the 4×2 and 2×2 supercells. Remarkably, the 2×2 guided $\mathrm{U}(1)$, the 2×2 $\mathrm{SU}(2)$, and the 4×2 $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ results agree very well with each other. The overlap between 2×2 and 4×2 $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ iPEPS substantiates the uniformity of the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ ground states. Furthermore, the alignment between 2×2 guided $\mathrm{U}(1)$ and 2×2 $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ iPEPS signifies that they are producing states that are physically analogous. This proposition is further supported by comparisons of other observables.

Conversely, the unguided $\mathrm{U}(1)$ iPEPS yields non-$\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetric states characterized by local magnetic orders, which exhibit a higher energy than the states produced by the other three methodologies. This suggests that an iPEPS preserving only the $\mathrm{U}(1)$ spin symmetry can become entrenched in specific local minimums in the absence of appropriate guidance or additional symmetry constraints.

% The 2×2 $\mathrm{U}(1)$ iPEPS produces a charge uniform state and has a higher energy than the period 4 stripe state generated by 8×2 $\mathrm{U}(1)$ iPEPS. This confirms that the period 4 stripe state is indeed the ground state as found in \cite{Corboz2019-Hubbard-PEPS}. On the other hand, the data points of 4×2 and 2×2 $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ iPEPS generally overlap with each other, indicating that they are physically identical quantum states. This is consistent with our finding that $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ iPEPS generates a uniform state and demonstrates the self-consistency of our $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ iPEPS algorithm.

An intuitive interpretation of this phenomenon is rooted in the observation that the configuration space of the $\mathrm{U}(1)$ iPEPS for the $\tnn$-$\tnnn$ Hubbard model is non-convex. This is depicted in Fig.~\ref{Configs}, a sketch of the energy landscape of such a configuration space. In this particular instance, two local minimums are present (though there could potentially be more, we limit our focus to the two most relevant local minimums): one resides within the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetric subspace; the other stays outside. It becomes evident that when the algorithm adheres to the guided sequence $D_g$, it remains within the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ symmetric subspace (blue arrow). However, in the absence of such a guidance, the algorithm veers away from the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ subspace, beginning from $D=2$ (red arrow). Hence, we have demonstrated that guided and unguided $\mathrm{U}(1)$ iPEPS can lead to markedly different results.

\section{Singlet Pairing Properties of the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ Ground States}
\label{Singlet}

Our $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ iPEPS simulations encounter a minor artifact at $D^*[D]\!=\!7[12]$ when measuring the singlet pairing amplitudes. Figure~\ref{PairingD} displays a 1×2 subcell as a representative of each 4×2 supercell, since the states are uniform in the horizontal direction. For the particular setting of $D^*[D]\!=\!7[12]$, the vertical bond in the middle exhibits a different symmetry structure \ifdefined\Publication than \else compared with \fi the other bonds. This discrepancy significantly impacts the measured singlet pairing properties, as they deviate markedly from the expected $d$-wave characteristics.

% \setcounter{figure}{4}
% Figure environment removed

We have confirmed that this anomaly arises exclusively at $D^*[D]\!=\!7[12]$. At adjacent $D^*[D]\!=\!6[9]$ and $D^*[D]\!=\!8[13]$ (as well as all smaller $D^*$), the symmetry structure remains consistent across all vertical and horizontal bonds, and the singlet pairing amplitudes demonstrate excellent $d$-wave characteristics, as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{PairingD}. Thus, we conclude that the ground state should exhibit a $d$-wave pairing order. In the main text, we present the pairing properties as derived from $D^*[D]\!=\!8[13]$.

% Fig.~\ref{PairingDoping} shows the singlet pairing properties of the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ ground states at different doping levels. We only show a 1×2 subcell of each 4×2 supercell since the states are uniform in the horizontal direction. We find that near $\delta=1/8$, there is $\Delta^\ey_{\mathbf{r}} \neq \Delta^\ey_{\mathbf{r}+\mathbf{y}}$, which does not comply with the standard $d$-wave pairing. As we increase the doping until $\delta\approx0.26$, standard $d$-wave pairing is gradually restored. For even larger doping, theres is $|\Delta^\ey_{\mathbf{r}}| > |\Delta^\ex_{\mathbf{r}}|$, indicating a $d$/$s$ mixed pairing.

\section{Stripes with Longer Periods}
\label{LongStripes}

In the main text, our focus is predominantly on the period 4 stripe states. Nevertheless, it is important to note that stripes with longer periods might emerge under varying parameter configurations. This section is dedicated to a further exploration of this aspect. As the manifestation of stripes with longer periods necessitates iPEPS on larger supercells, the computational cost can become significantly higher. Consequently, our objective here is not a complete optimization of the iPEPS across all scanning points. Rather, our aim is to estimate the region where the ground state begins to deviate from the charge uniform state.

\ifdefined\Publication We initiate \else Our approach entails initiating \fi the iPEPS simulation with a uniform state, obtained through guided $\mathrm{U}(1)$ iPEPS at large doping. Consider, for instance, a period 8 stripe. A 16×2 iPEPS is necessary to capture stripes characterized by period 8 charge orders. We acquire a single ground state via the guided 2×2 $\mathrm{U}(1)$ iPEPS at large doping, typically around $\delta\!\approx\!0.3$. Its 2×2 supercell is then replicated 8 times to construct a 16×2 supercell. The corresponding ground state subsequently serves as the initialization for the further 16×2 optimization at lower doping levels.

% Figure environment removed

The outcome of this process is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{LPStripe}. At the majority of scan points where $\delta\!>\!0.05$, the ground state derived from further 16×2 $\mathrm{U}(1)$ iPEPS optimization remains physically the same as the uniform state produced by guided 2×2 $\mathrm{U}(1)$ iPEPS (cross markers). As the doping level decreases, spin orders begin to appear (plus markers), followed by the charge orders (square marker). The pairing order is suppressed once the spin orders are fully developed. The estimated region for period 8 stripes is indicated as an orange shaded area in Fig.~\ref{LPStripe}. This region clearly resides beneath the estimated stripe/uniform boundary as derived in the main text. Consequently, this boundary can be confidently considered as a non-superconducting/superconducting demarcation for $\delta>0.05$.
