We constructed a scalable set of benchmark instances, focusing on sub-routes of
$10$ production operations for two product types from the SMT2020 simulation scenario~\cite{kopp2020smt2020}.
The $10$ operations in both sub-routes are processed by machines
belonging to three tool groups and do thus involve re-entrant flow,
as a lot visits the same tool group multiple times.
Moreover, the operations incorporate batching and specific setups, and machines undergo periodic maintenance operations.
In the following, we concentrate on instances with $9$ machines, i.e., $3$ per
tool group, and gradually increasing number of lots.
Further smaller- and larger-scale instances along with our implementation are
available online.\footref{foo:online}

We ran our experiments with \clingodl\ (version 1.4.0) on an Intel® Core™i7-8650U CPU Dell Latitude 5590 machine under Windows 10, imposing two time limits per run:
the first stage for makespan minimization is aborted at $450$ seconds, in which case the best schedule found so far % (if any) 
is taken as upper bound on the makespan for proceeding to minimize setup and batch violations with 
another $150$ seconds time limit.

Table~\ref{tab:table} reports the quality of best schedules obtained within the time limits for both optimization stages, split into `Makespan' and `Setup/Batch'
values, while two runtimes or `TO' for a timeout, respectively, are given in the
`1\ts{st}/2\ts{nd} Stage' rows, only listing a single `TO' entry in case both stages timed out.
The `Size' column provides the value taken for the constant \lstinline{sub_size},
limiting the number of machines in subgroups to which the operations are preallocated.
For the latter, the `Lot' columns include results with value \lstinline{0} for the constant \lstinline{lot_step}, where a common subgroup takes all operations for a lot, or for value \lstinline{1} in the `Step' columns, leading to their distribution among subgroups.

The `Size' value 1 necessarily leads to a fixed machine assignment, for which the
quality indicators clearly show that the `Step' strategy yields better schedules,
although it incurs more timeouts and thus fewer certain optima because operations on different lots increase the flexibility of execution sequences and thus search complexity.
While flexibility within subgroups by setting their `Size' to 2 or 3 in principle allows for improved schedules, we observe a deterioration due to sharply increasing instantiation size and search effort, as already observed in \cite{ali2023flexible}.
The setup strategy to differentiate operations and machines within subgroups,
activated by changing the constant \lstinline{by_setup},
aims to cut down the scheduling complexity in line with the optimization objectives by reducing the need for setup changes.
This leads to significantly improved schedules with `Size' 3, where the
`Lot' and `Step' preallocation strategies are indifferent and redundant results for the latter are omitted, up to a critical size reached with $100$~operations.

With our preliminary approach~\cite{ali2023flexible}, using a more naive and less feature-rich encoding of either fixed or fully flexible machine assignments, the
threshold at which problem size and combinatorics get prohibitive was reached at less than $50$ operations already.
Despite gearing up to double that size, our benchmark instances still represent small excerpts of the large-scale semiconductor fabs with more than $100$ tool groups and from $242$ to $543$ production operations per lot modeled by~\cite{kopp2020smt2020}.
%
The elevated complexity in comparison to basic settings like the traditional FJSP is mainly due to sophisticated setup and maintenance operations, requiring a detailed analysis of execution sequences on machines for SMSP.
We conjecture that similar scalability limits would also be encountered with MIP or CP encodings, yet the first-order modeling language of ASP with difference logic facilitates rapid prototyping and experimentation.
In fact, our performance evaluation aims to explore the feasibility of search and optimization, in order to come up with strategies for breaking down large SMSP instances into more manageable portions, e.g., focusing on some bottleneck tool groups or re-entrant flow of operations.

% This section will show the experimental results performed by applying the machine assignment strategies mentioned before, with several instances ranging from $30$ to $130$ steps and $6$ to $12$ machines. All experiments are run using an Intel\textsuperscript{\textregistered} Core\texttrademark{} i7-8650U CPU Dell Latitude 5590 machine under Windows 10. Our timeout limit is $600$ seconds, splitted to $450$ seconds for the makespan and $150$ seconds for the setup and batching. 

% We considered three tool groups for all generated instances in which batch processing, time/counter-based maintenance, and setup are considered. For generating the instances, we started with a small instance containing $30$ steps and $6$ machines where each tool group has $2$ machines and then we generate the next instance by adding one more lot, which has $10$ steps. We kept the tool group size till the fixed machine assignment strategy could not reach the optimum within the time limit. We created $3$ parameters \textit{size, idx} and \textit{setup} to activate a specific machine assignment strategy. The size determines the size of a sub-group in each tool group. The $idx$ defines the Job/Step-based indexing of all steps in the same tool group where all steps of the same lot will have the same index if the $idx = 0$ and Hence, they are assigned to the same sub-group/machine. If $idx = 1$, then each step in the tool group will have an identical index. The last parameter setup is to activate the setup strategy or not. If the $setup = 1$, then the setup strategy is applied; if $setup = 0$ then it's not applied.

% % To continue tomorrow isA :)
% Table \ref{tab:table01} shows the results of the instances with $2$ machines in each toll group. The first column refers to the strategy applied for the machine assignment. The second and third columns show the parameters for selecting a particular strategy. The assignment is fully flexible if the \textit{size} is greater than or equal to the number of machines in a tool group. Otherwise, the assignment is partially flexible. In the fourth column, we list our optimization criteria and the time limit for the makespan and setup/batching represented by 1st/2nd call. Each following two consecutive columns illustrate the results of an instance when the Job/Step-based indexing is selected. From the \ref{tab:table01}, we observed that the best-obtained results were achieved by the full flexible assignment in the first three instances and for the last instance, the setup strategy was the best. The fixed/setup strategies terminated within the time limit except for only one case.

% Table~\ref{tab:table02} summarizes the results of the subsequent $4$ instances where each tool group has $3$ machines. In this instances group, we can split the machines into sub-group by setting the \textit{size} parameter to $2$; in that case, we have two sub-groups in each tool group. The experiments demonstrated that the fixed strategy has the same or better performance than the flexible. In addition, the flexible strategy could not find a feasible solution for instances $7$ and $8$ when all machines were in the same group. On the other hand, the setup strategy performed better than the other two strategies when all machines were in one group, in addition to reaching the optimal value of the setup for all instances.

% Table~\ref{tab:table03} considers $4$ machines in each tool group and the flexible strategy obtained the best result for the first instance. However, it had the same feasibility issue when all machines were in the same group. For the rest instances, the setup strategy dominated when the machines were equally distributed into sub-groups. 

% From the conducted experiments, we can conclude that 
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item The flexible assignment performed well on the small-scale.
% 	\item While increasing the scale, the setup strategy dominates in the most cases
% 	\item Assigning the steps of the same lot independently with the fixed assignment leads to better performance
% 	\item The Setup strategy has a significant impact in minimizing the setup objective through all instances
% 	\item The full flexible assignment has an assignment issue while increasing the number of machines
