In this paper, we apply Google DeepMind's Deep Q Network (DQN) agent algorithm for Reinforcement Learning (RL) to semiconductor production scheduling. In an RL environment several cooperative DQN agents, which utilize deep neural networks, are trained with flexible user-defined objectives. We show benchmarks comparing standard dispatching heuristics with the DQN agents in an abstract frontend-of-line semiconductor production facility. Results are promising and show that DQN agents optimize production autonomously for different targets.},
