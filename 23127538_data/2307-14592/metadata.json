  "abstract": "Motivated by recent high-energy electron and $\\rm ^3H$ and $\\rm ^3He$ nuclei scattering experiment in Jefferson Lab (Nature 609, 41 (2022)), the short-range correlations (SRCs) between nucleon pairs for 3-nucleon systems are microscopically studied using realistic $NN$ 2-body interaction and two-Gaussian type $NNN$ 3-body interaction. The wave functions of both $\\rm ^3H$ and $\\rm ^3He$ are obtained by solving 3-body Schrödinger equations using Gaussian expansion method (GEM). The differences of one-nucleon and nucleon-nucleon momentum distributions between $\\rm ^3H$ and $\\rm ^3He$ are analyzed in detail. The results show that the percentages of $pn$-SRC pairs are significantly enhanced as compared with those of $nn(pp)$-SRC ones in $\\rm ^3H$ and $\\rm ^3He$ nuclei, which is consistent with the experimental findings.",
