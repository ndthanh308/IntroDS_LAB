\begin{abstract}
This paper raises an important issue about the interpretation of principal component analysis. The \textit{curse of isotropy} states that a covariance matrix with repeated eigenvalues yields rotation-invariant eigenvectors. In other words, principal components associated with equal eigenvalues show large intersample variability and are arbitrary combinations of potentially more interpretable components. However, empirical eigenvalues are never exactly equal in practice due to sampling errors. Therefore, most users overlook the problem. In this paper, we propose to identify datasets that are likely to suffer from the curse of isotropy by introducing a generative Gaussian model with repeated eigenvalues and comparing it to traditional models via the principle of parsimony. This yields an \textit{explicit} criterion to detect the curse of isotropy in practice. We notably argue that in a dataset with 1000 samples, all the eigenvalue pairs with a relative eigengap lower than 21\% should be assumed equal. This demonstrates that the curse of isotropy cannot be overlooked. In this context, we propose to transition from fuzzy principal components to much-more-interpretable principal subspaces. The final methodology---\textit{principal subspace analysis}---is extremely simple and shows promising results on a variety of datasets from different fields.

\section*{Materials and methods}
The following self-contained appendix formally introduces the principal subspace analysis model, derives all the results from scratch with proofs, details the associated methodology, and provides additional evidence that the curse of isotropy is an important phenomenon that should not be overlooked in practice.

%\section*{Appendix}
\paragraph{Abstract}
This appendix investigates a general family of covariance models with repeated eigenvalues extending probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA). A geometric interpretation shows that these models are parameterized by flag manifolds and stratify the space of covariance matrices according to the sequence of eigenvalue multiplicities. The subsequent analysis sheds light on PPCA and answers an important question on the practical identifiability of individual eigenvectors. It notably shows that one rarely has enough samples to fit a covariance model with distinct eigenvalues and that block-averaging the adjacent sample eigenvalues with small gaps achieves a better complexity/goodness-of-fit tradeoff.
