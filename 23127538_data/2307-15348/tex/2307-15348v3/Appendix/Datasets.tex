\section{Information about datasets}\label{appsec:data}
In this section, we give a few more details about the data used for the experiments.

\subsection{Natural image patches}
In this experiment, we consider 10 flower images from the ImageNet database~\cite{deng_imagenet_2009}. Those were downloaded from Kaggle (\url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prasunroy/natural-images}) and extracted from the folder \texttt{natural\_images/flower/} from \texttt{flower\_0000.jpg} up to \texttt{flower\_0009.jpg}.

\subsection{Eigenfaces}
In this experiment, we consider 31 digital images from the CMU Face Images database~\cite{mitchell_cmu_1997}. Those were downloaded from Kaggle (\url{https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raviprakash22/cmu-face-images}) and extracted from the folder \texttt{faces/faces/choon}. We only extracted the $(60, 64)$ images, corresponding to all the files ending with \texttt{\_2.pgm}.

\subsection{Structured data}
For the structured data experiment (cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:exp_rotation}) and the relative eigengap tables (cf. Fig.~\ref{fig:releigengap_UCI} and Fig.~\ref{appfig:releigengaps_real}), we consider data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (\url{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/}): Ionosphere~\cite{sigillito_ionosphere_1989}, Wine~\cite{aeberhard_wine_1991}, Wisconsin~\cite{wolberg_breast_1995}, Glass~\cite{german_glass_1987}, Iris~\cite{fisher_iris_1936}, Spambase~\cite{hopkins_spambase_1999}, Digits~\cite{alpaydin_optical_1998}, Covertype~\cite{blackard_covertype_1998}.
