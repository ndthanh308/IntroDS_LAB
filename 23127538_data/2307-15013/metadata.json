  "abstract": "We show that any free action of a connected Lie group of polynomial growth on a finite dimensional locally compact space has finite tube dimension. This is shown to imply that the associated crossed product C*-algebra has finite nuclear dimension. As an application we show that C*-algebras associated with certain aperiodic point sets in connected Lie groups of polynomial growth are classifiable. Examples include cut-and-project sets constructed from irreducible lattices in products of connected nilpotent Lie groups.",
