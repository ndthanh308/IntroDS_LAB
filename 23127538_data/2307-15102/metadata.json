  "abstract": "This study deals with the Ulam stability of non-autonomous linear differential systems without assuming the condition that they admit an exponential dichotomy. In particular, the best (minimal) Ulam constants for two-dimensional non-autonomous linear differential systems with generalized Jordan normal forms are derived. The obtained results are applicable not only to systems with solutions that exist globally on $(-\\infty,\\infty)$, but also to systems with solutions that blow up in finite time. New results are included even for constant coefficients. A wealth of examples are presented, and approximations of node, saddle, and focus are proposed. In addition, this is the first study to derive the best Ulam constants for non-autonomous systems other than periodic systems.",
