An important application area for the integration of robots with such advanced interaction capabilities is human\textendash robot collaboration. This aspect represents high socio-economic impacts and maintains the sense of purpose of the involved people, as the robots do not completely replace the humans from the work process. The research community's recent surge of interest in this area has been devoted to the implementation of various methodologies to achieve intuitive and seamless human\textendash robot-environment interactions by incorporating the collaborative partners' superior capabilities, e.g. human's cognitive and robot's physical power generation capacity. In fact, the main purpose of this paper is to review the state-of-the-art on intermediate human\textendash robot interfaces (bi-directional), robot control modalities, system stability, benchmarking and relevant use cases, and to extend views on the required future developments in the realm of human\textendash robot collaboration.},

Such a characterization hinges on three important aspects: firstly, the concept of composition of HCS; secondly, the general concept of specifications and their composition for HCS; finally, the dynamical structure and behaviors of HCS. The first aspect is introduced in a novel manner, including ideas from the literature of discrete transition systems and accounting for concepts such as that of dynamical feedback interconnection. The second point includes general properties that are of interest from a systems and control theory perspective. The third part categorizes the diverse and possibly pathological behaviors that are distinctive of HCS. A first look at the problem of Deadlock and Livelock Verification concludes the manuscript.},

  abstract = {In a haptic teleoperation system, the incorporation of knowledge about the remote environment in the controller design can improve stability and performance. Model-mediated teleoperation adopts this idea by rendering an estimated model of the remote environment on local site instead of transmitting force/velocity flows. Thus, the user perceives locally generated forces corresponding to the estimated and transmitted model parameters and the control loop between master and slave is opened. Less conservative stability boundaries and the applicability to teleoperation systems with arbitrary time delay are the main advantages of this approach. In order to guarantee a high fidelity, the estimation has to fit well with the measurements. In this paper, we extend the approach of model-mediated teleoperation to a full 6 degrees-of-freedom (DOF) teleoperation system with negligible time delay. We furthermore propose a hybrid approach for the estimation of the remote environment by combining the classical Kelvin-Voigt model and the nonlinear Hunt-Crossley model. Persistent excitation and device-dependent limitations of the estimation algorithm are discussed. Experimental results show stability and accuracy of the estimation technique as well as a superior fidelity of the proposed approach compared to a position-based admittance controller with fixed parameters even with negligible time delay.},

Design/methodology/approach \textendash{} An integrated mechatronic design approach for LWR is presented. Owing to the partially unknown properties of the environment, robustness of planning and control with respect to environmental variations is crucial. Robustness is achieved in this context through sensor redundancy and passivity-based control. In the DLR root concept, joint torque sensing plays a central role. Findings \textendash{} In order to act in unstructured environments and interact with humans, the robots have design features and control/software functionalities which distinguish them from classical robots, such as: load-to-weight ratio of 1:1, torque sensing in the joints, active vibration damping, sensitive collision detection, compliant control on joint and Cartesian level. Practical implications \textendash{} The DLR robots are excellent research platforms for experimentation of advanced robotics algorithms. Space and medical robotics are further areas for which these robots were designed and hopefully will be applied within the next years. Potential industrial application fields are the fast automatic assembly as well as manufacturing activities done in cooperation with humans (industrial robot assistant). The described functionalities are of course highly relevant also for the potentially huge market of service robotics. The LWR technology was transferred to KUKA Roboter GmbH, which will bring the first arms on the market in the near future. Originality/value \textendash{} This paper introduces a new type of LWR with torque sensing in each joint and describes a consistent approach for using these sensors for manipulation in human environments. To the best of one's knowledge, the first systematic experimental evaluation of possible injuries during robot-human crashes using standardized testing facilities is presented.},

Reachability analysis is one of the promising methods for hybrid system verification, which together with all other verification techniques faces the challenge of making the analysis scale with respect to the number of continuous state variables. The bottleneck of many reachability analysis techniques for hybrid systems is the geometrically computed intersection with guard sets. In this work, we replace the intersection operation by a nonlinear mapping onto the guard, which is not only numerically stable, but also scalable, making it possible to verify systems which were previously out of reach. The approach can be applied to the fairly common class of hybrid systems with piecewise continuous solutions, guard sets modeled as halfspaces, and urgent semantics, i.e. discrete transitions are immediately taken when enabled by guard sets. We demonstrate the usefulness of the new approach by a mechanical system with backlash which has 101 continuous state variables.},

Unfortunately, zonotopes are not closed under Minkowski difference for dimensions greater than two. However, we present an algorithm that efficiently computes a halfspace representation of the Minkowski difference of two zonotopes. In addition, we present an efficient algorithm that computes an approximation of the Minkowski difference in generator representation. The efficiency of the proposed solution is demonstrated by numerical experiments. These experiments show a reduced computation time in comparison to that when first the halfspace representation of zonotopes is obtained and the Minkowski difference is performed subsequently.},

Consequently, production processes are meticulously planned so that they last for long periods to make automation affordable. However, the ongoing trend toward mass customization and small-scale manufacturing requires purchasing new robots on a regular basis to cope with frequently changing production. Modular robots are a natural answer: Robots composed of standardized modules can be easily reassembled for new tasks, can be quickly repaired by exchanging broken modules, and are cost-effective by mass-producing standard modules usable for a large variety of robot types. Despite these advantages, modular robots have not yet left research laboratories because an expert must reprogram each new robot after assembly, rendering reassembly impractical. This work presents our set of interconnectable modules (IMPROV), which programs and verifies the safety of assembled robots themselves. Experiments show that IMPROV robots retained the same control performance as nonmodular robots, despite their reconfigurability. With respect to human-robot coexistence, our user study shows a reduction of robot idle time by 36\% without compromising on safety using our self-verification concept compared with current safety standards. We believe that by using self-programming and self-verification, modular robots can transform current automation practices.},

Reachability analysis can capture the whole set of possible solutions of a dynamic system and is thus used to prove that unsafe states are never reached; this requires full consideration of arbitrarily varying uncertain inputs, since sensor noise or disturbances usually do not follow any patterns. We use Krylov methods in this paper to compute reachable sets for large-scale linear systems. While Krylov methods have been used before in reachability analysis, we overcome the previous limitation that inputs must be (piecewise) constant. As a result, we can compute reachable sets of systems with several thousand state variables for bounded, but arbitrarily varying inputs.},

Previous work showed that abstracting the nonlinear continuous dynamics to linear differential inclusions results in a scalable approach for reachability analysis. However, when the abstraction becomes inaccurate, linearization techniques require splitting of reachable sets, resulting in an exponential growth of required linearizations. In this work, the nonlinearity of the dynamics is more accurately abstracted to polynomial difference inclusions. As a consequence, it is no longer guaranteed that reachable sets of consecutive time steps are mapped to convex sets as typically used in previous works. Thus, a non-convex set representation is developed in order to better capture the nonlinear dynamics, requiring no or much less splitting. The new approach has polynomial complexity with respect to the number of continuous state variables when splitting can be avoided and is thus promising when a linearization technique requires splitting for the same problem. The benefits are presented by numerical examples.},

  abstract = {We introduce zonotope bundles for computing the set of states reachable by a dynamical system, also known as the reachable set. Reachable set computations suffer from the curse of dimensionality, which has been successfully addressed by using zonotopes for linear systems. However, zonotopes are not closed under intersection leading to challenges when applying them to nonlinear and hybrid problems. We introduce zonotope bundles as the intersection of zonotopes (without explicitly computing the intersection). Zonotope bundles are closed under intersection, while inheriting many positive properties of zonotopes. This is demonstrated for linear, nonlinear, and hybrid systems. A further property of zonotope bundles is that their computation can be easily parallelized.},

We model hybrid systems as finite automata equipped with variables that evolve continuously with time according to dynamical laws. For verification purposes, we restrict ourselves to linear hybrid systems, where all variables follow piecewise-linear trajectories. We provide decidability and undecidability results for classes of linear hybrid systems, and we show that standard program-analysis techniques can be adapted to linear hybrid systems. In particular, we consider symbolic model-checking and minimization procedures that are based on the reachability analysis of an infinite state space. The procedures iteratively compute state sets that are definable as unions of convex polyhedra in multidimensional real space. We also present approximation techniques for dealing with systems for which the iterative procedures do not converge.},

While the reachability problem is undecidable even for very restricted classes of hybrid automata, we present two semidecision procedures for verifying safety properties of piecewiselinear hybrid automata, in which all variables change at constant rates. The two procedures are based, respectively, on minimizing and computing fixpoints on generally infinite state spaces. We show that if the procedures terminate, then they give correct answers.

In this paper, we present a data-driven methodology for separating and modelling inherent delays during robot control. We show how both actuation and response delays can be modelled using modern machine learning methods. The resulting models can be used to predict the delays as well as the uncertainty of the prediction. Experiments on two widely used robot platforms show significant actuation and response delays in standard control loops. Predictive models can, therefore, be used to reason about expected delays and improve temporal accuracy during control. The approach can easily be used on different robot platforms.},

This article aims to compare and evaluate the main features and properties of some of the most common control schemes proposed in the literature, firstly presenting the criteria adopted for the comparative study and then illustrating and discussing the results of the comparison. Moreover, some general criteria will be presented for the selection of the control parameters considering that, due to time delay, a tradeoff between stability and performances has to be made in the selection of these parameters.},

Rather than studying a complex nonlinear system x = g(x), we study an approximating system x = f(x) which is easier to handle. The class of approximating systems we consider in this paper is piecewise linear, obtained by interpolating g over a mesh. In order to be conservative, we add a bounded input in the approximating system to account for the interpolation error. We thus develop a reachability method for systems with input, based on the relation between such systems and the corresponding autonomous systems in terms of reachable sets. This method is then extended to the approximate piecewise linear systems arising in our construction. The final result is a reachability algorithm for nonlinear continuous systems which allows to compute conservative approximations with as great degree of accuracy as desired, and more importantly, it has good convergence rate. If g is a C2 function, our method is of order 2. Furthermore, the method can be straightforwardly extended to hybrid systems.},

The presentation covers, in a unified manner, a variety of methods handling increasingly complex types of continuous dynamics (constant derivative, linear, nonlinear).

Induced by signal transmission, conversion, the nature of plants, and so on, delays may appear either in the continuous evolution of a hybrid system such that the evolution depends not only on the present state but also on its execution history, or in the discrete switching between its different control modes. In this paper we come up with a new model of hybrid systems, called delay hybrid automata, to capture the dynamics of systems with the aforementioned two kinds of delays. Furthermore, based upon this model we study the robust switching controller synthesis problem such that the controlled delay system is able to satisfy the specified safety properties regardless of perturbations. To the end, a novel method is proposed to synthesize switching controllers based on the computation of differential invariants for continuous evolution and backward reachable sets of discrete jumps with delays. Finally, we implement a prototypical tool of our approach and demonstrate it on some case studies.},

Flow-pipe construction methods can check whether specifications are met for all states, rather than just testing using a finite and incomplete set of simulation traces. A fundamental challenge when using flow-pipe construction on high-dimensional systems is the cost of geometric operations, such as intersection and convex hull. We address this challenge by showing that it is often possible to remove the need to perform high-dimensional geometric operations by combining two model transformations, direct time-triggered conversion and dynamics scaling. Further, we prove the overapproximation error in the conversion can be made arbitrarily small. Finally, we show that our transformation-based approach enables the analysis of a drivetrain system with up to 51 dimensions.},

We therefore developed a novel trajectory planner for a robot arm, which formally guarantees the safety of humans from collision with the robot for every possible human behaviour, without restricting the robot more than necessary. To achieve this, the trajectory planner verifies online that the robot adheres to two separate safety criteria derived from ISO standards using reachable occupancies of surrounding humans and the robot. While one criterion anticipates all possible movements of the human and provides a reasonable safety guarantee, the other criterion additionally guarantees strict safety as long as the human behaves as expected according to ISO standards. We implemented the trajectory planner for a real robot arm and show some experimental results.},

Asymptotic analysis of constant sampling rate as the intersample time tends to zero shows that the error variances tend to zero, but at decreasing rates for the angle, velocity, and acceleration errors.

However, RL is still not widely adopted in real robotic systems because working with real hardware entails additional challenges, especially when using position-controlled manipulators. The main contribution of this work is a learning-based method to solve peg-in-hole tasks with hole-position uncertainty.

The application benefits from these developments are discussed as well as the technical challenges that the robot manufacturers meet. Model-based control is now a key technology for the control of industrial robots and models and control schemes are continuously refined to meet the requirements on higher performance even when the cost pressure leads to the design of robot mechanics that is more difficult to control. Driving forces for the future development of robots can be found in, for example, new robot applications in the automotive industry, especially for the final assembly, in small and medium size enterprises, in foundries, in food industry and in the processing and assembly of large structures. Some scenarios on future robot control development are proposed. One scenario is that lightweight robot concepts could have an impact on future car manufacturing and on future automation of small and medium size enterprises (SMEs). Such a development could result in modular robots and in control schemes using sensors in the robot arm structure, sensors that could also be used for the implementation of redundant safe control. Introducing highly modular robots will increase the need of robot installation support, making Plug and Play functionality even more important. One possibility to obtain a highly modular robot program could be to use a recently developed new type of parallel kinematic robot structure with large work space in relation to the robot foot print. For further efficient use of robots, the scenario of adaptive robot performance is introduced. This means that the robot control is optimised with respect to the thermal and fatigue load on the robot for the specific program that the robot performs. The main conclusion of the presentation is that industrial robot development is far away from its limits and that a lot of research and development is needed to obtain a more widely use of robot automation in industry.

The assumption that the Cauchy stress depends non-linearly on the linearized strain can be justified if one starts with the assumption that the kinematical quantity, the left Cauchy-Green stretch tensor, is a nonlinear function of the Cauchy stress, and linearizes under the assumption that the displacement gradient is small. Long-time and large data existence, uniqueness and regularity properties of weak solution to such a generalized Kelvin-Voigt model are established for the non-homogeneous mixed boundary value problem. The main novelty with regard to the mathematical analysis consists in including nonlinear (non-quadratic) dissipation in the problem.},

Design/methodology/approach The basic impedance function with a pre-PID tuner is designed to improve the force response. A dynamic adaptive adjustment function that combines the advantages of hybrid impedance and adaptive hybrid impedance control is presented to achieve both force overshoots suppressing and tracking ability. Findings The introduced pre-PID tuner impedance function can achieve more than the pure impedance function in aspects of converging to the desired value and reducing the force overshoots. The performance of force overshoots suppression and force tracking error are maintained by introducing the dynamic adaptive sigma adjustment function. The simulation and experimental results both show the achieved control performance by comparing with the previous control methods. Practical implications The implementation of the controller is easy and convenient in practical manufacture scenes that require force control using industrial robots. Originality/value A superior robot controller adapting to a variety of complex tasks owing to the following characteristics: maintenance of high-accuracy position tracking capability in free-space (basic capabilities of modern industrial robots); maintenance of high speed, stability and smooth contact performance in collision stage; and presentation of high-precision force tracking capability in steady contact.},

The results on the duality property show that the transpose Jacobian matrix can be replaced by the inverse Jacobian matrix and vice versa.

  abstract = {The task of the peg-in-hole assembly is a very common task in industry. Despite its intuitive comprehensibility and everyday experience, the industrial assembly faces specific problems. The naive approach of inserting with bare hands an industrial peg inside into an industrial hole can very certainly bring to the jamming and damaging because of a very small gap between them. Therefore, the initial alignment of the details before insertion, so-called peg-on-hole phase, or simply peg-on-hole, is of the special importance in industry to avoid jamming. This paper develops the description and analysis of this phase based on the methods of analytical mechanics. As a common approach, the details in this study are considered as cylindrical, and such that peg is supported at the edge of vertically fixed hole, and could freely move keeping a three-point contact with three degrees of freedom, namely (i) nutation angle or align describing planar motion of aligning parts, (ii) precession angle or slide describing rotational motion around hole axis, and (iii) self-rotation angle or slip describing rotational motion about its axis. The analytical approach implies the system of Lagrange Equations for this particular case of motion, which is called Dynamic Differential Equations (DDE). DDE describes interconnections between motion in three degrees of freedom on one side, reaction forces on another side, and the external forces and torques on the third side. DDE includes geometrical properties of the details, and full descriptions of velocities, normal reactions, and friction forces at the contact points. It is the most general description of the pegon-hole case. As the example of application, the normal reactions were found for relative large alignment angles far from reduction into a two-point contact, and for a small alignment angles, when system transits to the two-point contact. It was shown that for both cases, reaction forces become larger during alignment because they have to balance the force of gravity. For the larger angles, slip reduces the reaction forces, whereas for small alignment angles, slip and slide increases them.},

The robot alternates active and passive behaviours during assembly, to lighten the burden on the operator in the first case, and to comply to his/her needs in the latter. Our approach can successfully manage direct physical contact between robot and human, and between robot and environment. Furthermore, it can be applied to standard position (and not torque) controlled robots, common in the industry. The approach is validated in a series of assembly experiments. The human workload is reduced, diminishing the risk of strain injuries. Besides, a complete risk analysis indicates that the proposed setup is compatible with the safety standards, and could be certified.},

However, IADs and other physical human\textendash robot interaction (pHRI) devices are themselves generally powerful enough to cause harm. We argue that the differences between pHRI applications and conventional industrial manipulation requires that safety and reliability standards be rethought, and we offer a preview of the directions currently being undertaken by international standards committees.We chapter discuss the new frontiers of robotic physical interaction with humans, describing motivations and applications of safe pHRI. The state of the art, and the technical challenges to develop new robotic systems for safe and effective collaboration with people, are discussed, subdividing the exposition into hands-off and hands-on pHRI systems.

The assembly tasks are decomposed into assembly skill primitives based on transitions described on a taxonomy of contact relations. Force feedback operations are described as a set of force compliance skills which are systematically associated to the assembly skill primitives. To determine the visual feedback operations and the type of visual information needed, a backward propagation process of geometrical constraints is used. This process defines new visual feedback requirements for the tasks from the discovery of direct, and indirect, insertion and contact dependencies among the mating parts.},

On top of this layer, safe human-robot collaboration tasks can be realized. Collaboration phases are activated and ended by human gestures or voice commands. Intentional physical interaction is enabled and exchanged forces are estimated by integrating the residual with an estimation of the contact point obtained from depth sensing.

While there are certainly also ``cognitive'' issues involved, due to the human perception of the robot (and vice versa), and other objective metrics related to fault detection and isolation, our discussion focuses on the peculiar aspects of ``physical'' interaction with robots. In particular, safety and dependability are the underlying evaluation criteria for mechanical design, actuation, and control architectures.

We formulate the search for such configurations as a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP). Collision constraints in an operation and transfer constraints between operations determine the sets of feasible robot configurations. We show that solving the connected constraint graph with off-the-shelf CSP algorithms can quickly become infeasible even for a few sequential assembly operations. We present an algorithm which, through the assumption of feasible regrasps, divides the CSP into independent smaller problems that can be solved exponentially faster. The algorithm then uses local search techniques to improve this solution by removing a gradually increasing number of regrasps from the plan. The algorithm enables the user to stop the planner anytime and use the current best plan if the cost of removing regrasps from the plan exceeds the cost of executing those regrasps. We present simulation experiments to compare our algorithm's performance to a naive algorithm which directly solves the connected constraint graph. We also present a physical robot system which uses the output of our planner to grasp and bring parts together in assembly configurations.},

In this paper, we present a recently developed data-driven formal verification technique and demonstrate its applicability in a case study involving integrated safety analysis of an Automatic Emergency Braking (AEB) system. Our technique combines model-based, hybrid system reachability analysis with sensitivity analysis of components with possibly unknown or inaccessible models. The scenarios we consider for safety analysis are representative of the most common type of rear-end crashes, which are used for evaluating AEB and forward collision avoidance systems. We show that our verification tool DryVR can effectively establish safety of these scenarios (specified by parameters like braking profiles, initial velocities, uncertainties in position and reaction times), and compute the severity of accidents for unsafe scenarios. The analysis can quantify the safety envelope of the system in the parameter space which is valuable for both design and certification. We also show how the reachability analysis can be combined with statistical information about the parameters, to assess the risk-level of the system, which in turn is essential, for determining Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASIL) mandated by the ISO26262 standard.},

Second, the contact forces are described by the screw theory in three dimensions. The small motions of the peg around the contact points (the small motion rules) are improved, so the redundant problem can be overcome and the magnitude of the contact force can be obtained. Third, the maximum angle's steepest descent algorithm is proposed to infer the motion direction. Based on the analyses, a simulation program and an experiment of a triple peg-in-hole insertion are presented.

To preserve safe distance from obstacles and at the same time suggest the user a preferred direction to progress along the path, the virtual fixtures are generated by arbitrarily redirecting assistive forces obtained by summation of attractive and repulsive potential fields. The main result of the paper is the definition of a passivity preserving condition for this redirection, so that the behavior of the teleoperated systems remains safe and stable. The proposed assisted mode of teleoperation has been tested on a surgical robot prototype with dual arms configuration, since robotic surgery represents a suitable application domain for such control schemes.},

The proposed controller enables the teleoperation system to compensate human and environmental disturbances, while achieving master and slave position coordination in both free motion and contact situation. The current work basically extends the passivity based architecture upon the earlier work of Lee and Spong (2006) [14] to improve position tracking and consequently transparency in the face of disturbances and environmental contacts. The proposed controller employs a PID controller in each side to overcome some limitations of a PD controller and guarantee an improved performance. Moreover, by using Fourier transform and Parseval's identity in the frequency domain, we demonstrate that this new PID controller preserves the passivity of the system. Simulation and semi-experimental results show that the PID controller tracking performance is superior to that of the PD controller tracking performance in slave/environmental contacts.},

Guarantees on the safety and performance of such hybrid systems can still be challenging to generate, however. Reachability analysis using a dynamic game formulation with Hamilton\textemdash Jacobi methods provides a useful way to generate these types of guarantees, and the technique is flexible enough to analyze a wide variety of systems. This paper presents two applications of reachable sets, both focused on guaranteeing the safety and performance of robotic aerial vehicles.

In the second, reachability analysis is used to design a decentralized collision avoidance algorithm for multiple quadrotors. The theory for both examples is explained, and successful experimental results are presented from flight tests on the STARMAC quadrotor helicopter platform.},

  abstract = {This assignment focused on the remote side where, embracing previous implementations, it aimed to enhance the recognition of the real environment and make available a first rough assessment of those physical properties by the only visual data. In present days, performing complex tasks from a remote site through the use of intermediate mechatronic  systems is not an illusion anymore (one can think of the Da Vinci surgical system, for example). That  is why telepresence and telemanipulation are topics of research and development within the i-Botics Joint  Innovation Center - a collaboration between the University of Twente and TNO. Combining the cognitive ability  of the human operator with the robotic capabilities at a distance is the main objective of this cooperation.  Robots never get tired, neither bored nor injured. However, they are still far away from understanding  a situation through the senses human beings have been developing for thousand of hundreds of years of  evolution on Earth. Therefore, improving these sensing capabilities would allow them to be used even more  in complicated tasks where those human abilities and ``situational awareness'' are required, avoiding human  presence in hazardous scenarios (one can think of EOD or pipe inspection robots).  In a typical teleoperated system, unavoidable latencies in between operator (master) and the end-robot  (at the slave site) jeopardise transparency (haptic performance) and endanger stability. However, it is known  from previous studies that having available a more accurate model of the remote environment, i.e. where the  manipulation takes place, would enhance the overall performance the system. For this purpose, an adaptive  impedance law can be implemented on each controller side when force/position measurements are available  within the Bilateral Impedance Control architecture.  Within a typical teleoperation scheme as in figure 1, this assignment focused on the remote side where,  embracing previous implementations, it aimed to enhance the recognition of the real environment. It has  been accomplished by means of an on-line estimation of the dynamic properties of the physical surrounding,  when a 7 DOF telecontrolled robotic arm interacts with it. Within the same operational scenario and making  use of these estimates, the system can be then trained to have available a first rough assessment of those  physical properties by the only visual data. Eventually, these attributes can clustered and associated to the  corresponding item in the reconstructed virtual world, so as to end up with a ``multisensorial picture'' of the  reality.},

Using a lightweight robot that was especially designed for interactive and cooperative tasks, we show how reactive control strategies can significantly contribute to ensuring safety to the human during physical interaction. Several collision tests were carried out, illustrating the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed approach. While a subjective ``safety '' feeling is experienced by users when being able to naturally stop the robot in autonomous motion, a quantitative analysis of different reaction strategies was lacking. In order to compare these strategies on an objective basis, a mechanical verification platform has been built. The proposed collision detection and reactions methods prove to work very reliably and are effective in reducing contact forces far below any level which is dangerous to humans. Evaluations of impacts between robot and human arm or chest up to a maximum robot velocity of 2.7 m/s are presented. I.},

An essential requirement for such a robot is that it must under no circumstances pose a threat to the human operator. To actually quantify the potential injury risk emanating from the manipulator, impact test were carried out using standard automobile crash-test facilities at the ADAC1. In our evaluation we focused on unexpected rigid frontal impacts, i.e. injuries caused by sharp edges are excluded.

In order to enable robots to share their workspace with humans and physically interact with them, fast and reliable handling of possible collisions on the entire robot structure is needed, along with control strategies for safe robot reaction. The primary motivation is the prevention or limitation of possible human injury due to physical contacts. In this survey paper, based on our early work on the subject, we review, extend, compare, and evaluate experimentally model-based algorithms for realtime collision detection, isolation, and identification that use only proprioceptive sensors. This covers the context-independent phases of the collision event pipeline for robots interacting with the environment, as in physical human-robot interaction or manipulation tasks. The problem is addressed for rigid robots first, and then extended to the presence of joint/transmission flexibility. The basic, physically-motivated solution has already been applied to numerous robotic systems worldwide, ranging from manipulators and humanoids to flying robots, and even to commercial products.},

In this paper we will investigate many aspects relevant to this sort of injury mechanisms and discuss the importance to domestic environments or production assistants. Since clamped impacts are intrinsically more dangerous than free ones it is fundamental to discuss and evaluate metrics to ensure safe interaction if clamping is possible.

For needs of mathematical modelling, it is aggregated into a total phenomenon called time delay or dead time. If a real system with time delay is modelled as a time invariant linear system, its transfer function (rational function) becomes due to time delay a transcendental function. Most of methods used for analysis and synthesis of control systems are developed for transfer functions in the form of rational functions only. If these methods have to be used also for dynamical systems with time delay then it is necessary to approximate transfer functions of time delay by means of rational functions. Approximations usually use either Pad\'e approximation or Taylor series of the exponential function. A simple modification of Pad\'e approximation application is given in the contribution. It improves its time behaviour not only close to the origin but also in longer time ranges.},

The human-robot interface must be intuitive to use and the safety of the user with respect to injuries inflicted by collisions with the robot must be guaranteed. In this paper we describe the formulation and implementation of a control strategy for robot manipulators which provides quantitative safety guarantees for the user of assistant-type robots. We propose a control scheme for robot manipulators that restricts the torque commands of a position control algorithm to values that comply to preset safety restrictions. These safety restrictions limit the potential impact force of the robot in the case of a collision with a person. Such accidental collisions may occur with any part of the robot and therefore the impact force not only of the robot's hand but of all surfaces is controlled by the scheme. The integration of a visual control interface and the safety controlled robot allows the safe and intuitive interaction between a person and the robot. As an example application, the system is programmed to retrieve eye-gaze-selected objects from a table and to hand them over to the user on demand.},

Smooth robot dynamics can be simulated efficiently and accurately, and therefore, readily used in model-based control schemes. However, some of the most difficult and important problems in robotics, such as running, grasping, and parts assembly, involve intermittent frictional contacts, which introduce extreme nonlinearities into the dynamics. Numerous approaches have been developed to simulate contact dynamics. Even though real bodies are not rigid, idealized rigid contact models have been used widely and productively for decades. However, the resulting nonsmooth dynamics can be computationally difficult to solve or use in model-based planning and control, motivating researchers to propose various relaxations of the idealized contact models. The varied origins and formulations of these approaches can obscure their similarities and differences. In this letter, we identify and explain differences between four contact models. We present the models in the context of one solver that is applicable to all of them, namely Projected Gauss-Seidel, in order to highlight their common structure and to avoid confounding their comparison with differences in the solution methods. Simulation results from sliding, wedging, grasping, and stacking experiments illustrate consequences of the differences. The results can help inform roboticists when comparing and selecting models for their specific applications.},

The objective of this article is to review important aspects of this control scheme that are reported in the literature. We begin by showing the boundedness of solutions for the closed-loop system, and conditions for equilibrium uniqueness. The global asymptotic stability analysis provided by Takegaki and Arimoto (1981) is discussed in detail, as well as an alternative method that uses a strict Lyapunov function. The stability robustness of the control system against parametric uncertainties is also ad dressed. We show that interesting phenomena such as equilibria bifurcation can appear if the design procedure is violated. To overcome parametric uncertainties, we review an adaptive ver sion of the PD control with desired gravity compensation, and finally, we revise an extension of the controller to handle robots with elastic joints.},

  abstract = {Consideration of dynamics is critical in the analysis, design, and control of robot systems. This article presents an extensive study of the dynamic properties of several important classes of robotic structures and proposes a number of general dynamic strategies for their coordination and control. This work is a synthesis of both previous and new results developed within the task-oriented operational space formulation. Here we in troduce a unifying framework for the analysis and control of robotic systems, beginning with an analysis of inertial prop erties based on two models that independently describe the mass and inertial characteristics associated with linear and angular motions. To visualize these properties, we propose a new geometric representation, termed the belted ellipsoid, that displays the magnitudes of the mass/inertial properties directly rather than their square roots. Our study of serial macro/mini structures is based on two models of redundant mechanisms. The first is a description of the task-level dy namics that results from projecting the system dynamics into operational space. The second is a unique dynamically con sistent relationship between end-effector forces and joint torques. It divides control torques at the joint level into two dynamically decoupled vectors: torques that correspond to forces at the end effector, and torques that affect only internal motions. The analysis of inertial properties of macro-/mini- manipulator systems reveals another important characteristic: that of reduced effective inertia. We show that the effective mass/inertia of a macro-/mini-manipulator is bounded above by the mass/inertia of the mini-manipulator alone. Because mini structures have a limited range of motion, we also pro pose a dextrous dynamic coordination strategy to allow full use of the high mechanical bandwidth of the mini-structures in extended-motion operations. Finally, a study of the dy namics of parallel, multiarm structures reveals an important additive property. The effective mass and inertia of a multi arm system at some operational point are shown to be given by the sum of the effective masses and inertias associated with the object and each arm. Using this property, the mul tiarm system can be treated as a single augmented object and controlled by the total operational forces applied by the arms. Both the augmented object construct and the dynam ically consistent force/torque relationship are extended for the analysis and control of multiarm systems involving redun dancy.},

In human robot interaction (HRI), constrained collisions can be particularly hazardous to the human and recently, collision test devices were developed that assess safety in such scenarios. In this paper, we propose the concept of a constrained collision force map (CCFM), which relates the robot impact velocity and the collision reaction method its parameterization to the peak collision force in a constrained collision scenario. The CCFM is a tool that will help practitioners to implement both safe and efficient HRI applications and to understand the robot's collision behavior. In this work, we derive the CCFM for three robots (UR10e, UR5e, and Franka Emika Panda) for varying contact thresholds, contact stiffnesses, and robot poses. Finally, we compare our results with the force estimation suggested by ISO/TS 15066:2016.},

This may result in different interpretations for the contact classification and thus no unique outcome can be expected, which may even cause a risk to the human. In previous work, we showed a first set of implications. This paper addresses the possible interpretations of a collision scenario as a result of the varying interpretations for a risk assessment. With an experiment including four commercially available robot systems we demonstrate the procedure of the risk assessment following the different interpretations of the TS. The results indicate possible incorrect use of the technical specification, which we believe needs to be resolved in future revisions. For this, we suggest tools in form of a decision tree and constrained collision force maps, which enable a simple, unambiguous risk assessment for HRI.},

Also the current standard ISO/TS 15066 highlights the importance of this parameter and provides a method to determine the maximum safe robot velocity based on the effective mass. To enable both safe and efficient robot applications, it is crucial to derive the robot's instantaneous effective mass sufficiently accurate based on either a), a kinematic and dynamic model or b), a suitable collision experiment. In this paper, we describe and quantitatively compare the wellestablished reflected mass model by Khatib and the simplified model provided in the ISO/TS 15066 for the KUKA LWR IV+ and the Franka Emika Panda robot. Furthermore, we propose a method to practically determine the effective mass using a passive mechanical pendulum setup. Our results show that the simplified ISO/TS model can lead to a significant safety-relevant error. With our preliminary experimental setup, however, we can verify that the reflected mass obtained by the dynamics model only differs 1.1 -7.8 \% from the measured value.},

The main difficulty for hybrid system reachability analysis is to calculate the intersection between reachable set and guard sets. While there exist several approaches for guard sets defined by hyperplanes or polytopes, only few methods are able to handle nonlinear guard sets. In this work we present a novel approach to tightly enclose the intersections of reachable sets with nonlinear guard sets. One major advantage of our method is its polynomial complexity with respect to the system dimension, which makes it applicable for high-dimensional systems. Furthermore, our approach can be combined with different reachability algorithms for continuous systems due to its modular design. We demonstrate the advantages of our novel approach compared to existing methods with numerical examples.},

To learn the execution of assembly operations even when the geometry of the product varies across task executions, the robot needs to be able to adapt its motion based on a parametric description of the current task condition, which is usually provided by geometrical properties of the parts involved in the assembly. In our previous work we showed how positional control policies can be generalized to different task conditions. In this paper we propose a complete methodology to generalize also the orientational trajectories and the accompanying force-torque profiles to compute the necessary control policy for a given condition of the assembly task. Our method is based on statistical generalization of successfully recorded executions at different task conditions, which are acquired by kinesthetic guiding. The parameters that describe the varying task conditions define queries into the recorded training data. To improve the execution of the skill after generalization, we combine the proposed approach with an adaptation method, thus enabling the refinement of the generalized assembly operation.

Seventeen of the most widely used approaches found in the scientific literature are implemented and compared to each other, namely: the Inverse Dynamic Identification Model with Ordinary, Weighted, Iteratively Reweighted and Total Least-Squares (IDIM-OLS, -WLS, -IRLS, -TLS); the Instrumental Variables method (IDIM-IV), the Maximum Likelihood (ML) method; the Direct and Inverse Dynamic Identification Model approach (DIDIM); the Closed-Loop Output Error (CLOE) method; the Closed-Loop Input Error (CLIE) method; the Direct Dynamic Identification Model with Nonlinear Kalman Filtering (DDIM-NKF), the Adaline Neural Network (AdaNN), the Hopfield-Tank Recurrent Neural Network (HTRNN) and eventually a set of Physically Consistent (PC-) methods allowing the enforcement of parameter physicality using Semi-Definite Programming, namely the PC-IDIM-OLS, -WLS, -IRLS, PC-IDIM-IV, and PC-DIDIM. BIRDy is robot-agnostic and features a complete inertial parameter identification pipeline, from the generation of symbolic kinematic and dynamic models to the identification process itself.

Normally, the dynamics and constraints of a contact-constrained robot are nonlinear and coupled to each other. Instead of linearizing the model and constraints, we solve the optimal control problem directly to obtain feasible state trajectories and their corresponding control inputs. A tractable optimal control problem is formulated and subsequently addressed by dual approaches, which rely on sampling-based dynamic programming and rigorous reachability analysis tools. In particular, a sampling-based method together with a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process solution approach are used to break down the end-to-end trajectory generation problem by generating a sequence of subregions that the system's trajectory will have to pass through to reach its final destination. The distinctive characteristic of the proposed trajectory optimization algorithm is its ability to handle the intricate contact constraints, coupled with the system dynamics, in a computationally efficient way.

Lagrange's impact model is used to derive a general form of impact equations for an industrial manipulator performing peg-in-hole assembly. Specific impact equations can then be generated for a given robot to analyze part motions and contact forces in the mating of parts. The impact equations of a SCARA robot are obtained and utilized to investigate how the system parameters affect force impulse and departure angle in the assembly of a peg with a chamfered hole. The resulting information is useful to robot manufacturers in design of robotic equipment and to robot users in determining optimal operational conditions. It is also useful for building an intelligent robot controller capable of deciding on proper values of operation parameters.},

While many approaches have been proposed for the velocity estimation of robot joints, no comprehensive experimental evaluation exists, making it difficult to choose the appropriate method. This paper compares multiple estimation methods running on a six degrees-of-freedom manipulator. We evaluate: 1) the estimation error using a high-accuracy ground-truth signal, 2) the closed-loop tracking error, 3) convergence behavior, 4) sensor fault tolerance, 5) implementation and tuning effort. To ensure a fair comparison, we optimally tune the estimators using a genetic algorithm. All estimation methods have a similar estimation error and similar closed-loop tracking performance, except for the nonlinear high-gain observer, which is not accurate enough. Sliding-mode observers can provide a precise velocity estimation despite sensor faults.},

  abstract = {The calculation of the minimum distance between surfaces plays an important role in computational mechanics, namely, in the study of constrained multibody systems where contact forces take part. In this paper, a general rigid contact detection methodology for non-conformal bodies, described by ellipsoidal and superellipsoidal surfaces, is presented. The mathematical framework relies on simple algebraic and differential geometry, vector calculus, and on the C2 continuous implicit representations of the surfaces. The proposed methodology establishes a set of collinear and orthogonal constraints between vectors defining the contacting surfaces that, allied with loci constraints, which are specific to the type of surface being used, formulate the contact problem. This set of non-linear equations is solved numerically with the Newton\textendash Raphson method with Jacobian matrices calculated analytically. The method outputs the coordinates of the pair of points with common normal vector directions and, consequently, the minimum distance between both surfaces. Contrary to other contact detection methodologies, the proposed mathematical framework does not rely on polygonal-based geometries neither on complex non-linear optimization formulations. Furthermore, the methodology is extendable to other surfaces that are (strictly) convex, interact in a non-conformal fashion, present an implicit representation, and that are at least C2 continuous. Two distinct methods for calculating the tangent and binormal vectors to the implicit surfaces are introduced: (i) a method based on the Householder reflection matrix; and (ii)a method based on a square plate rotation mechanism. The first provides a base of three orthogonal vectors, in which one of them is collinear to the surface normal. For the latter, it is shown that, by means of an analogy to the referred mechanism, at least two non-collinear vectors to the normal vector can be determined. Complementarily, several mathematical and computational aspects, regarding the rigid contact detection methodology, are described. The proposed methodology is applied to several case tests involving the contact between different (super) ellipsoidal contact pairs. Numerical results show that the implemented methodology is highly efficient and accurate for ellipsoids and superellipsoids.

The advantage of such a control paradigm is the ability to manipulate in both unconstrained and constrained environments. Unlike hybrid control methods that attempt to control forces and motions in orthogonal directions, impedance control consists of a single control law that accommodates external forces. One problem associated with such a controller is the selection of the robot's target impedance.

The integration of a real time estimate of the robot's environment with the impedance controller resolves this problem.

Compared to recent efforts developed for similar tasks, where every object was assumed to be novel, the proposed system recognizes previously manipulated objects and performs online model reconstruction and reuse. Over a lifelong manipulation process, the system keeps learning features of objects it has interacted with and updates their reconstructed models. Whenever an instance of a previously manipulated object reappears, the system aims to first recognize it and then register its previously reconstructed model given the current observation. This step greatly reduces object shape uncertainty allowing the system to even reason for parts of the objects that are currently not observable. This also results in better manipulation efficiency as it reduces the need for active perception of the target object during manipulation. To get a reusable reconstructed model, the proposed pipeline adopts i) TSDF for object representation, and ii) a variant of the standard particle filter algorithm for pose estimation and tracking of the partial object model. Furthermore, an effective way to construct and maintain a dataset of manipulated objects is presented. A sequence of real-world manipulation experiments is performed to show how future manipulation tasks become more effective and efficient by reusing reconstructed models of previously manipulated objects that were generated on the fly instead of treating objects as novel every time.},

Existence of dead time in the systems poses a challenge to control and stabilize, especially in a control feedback loop. Pad\'e approximation provides a determinate approximation of the dead time in the continuous process systems, which can be utilized in the further simulations of equivalent First Order plus Dead Time Models. However, the standard Pad\'e approximation with the same numerator- denominator derivative power, exhibits a jolt at time t=0. This gives an inaccurate approximation of the dead time. To avoid this phenomenon, increasing orders of Pad\'e approximation is applied. In the following manuscript, equivalent First Order plus Dead-Time models of two blending systems of orders four and seven are analysed for the same. As the orders of the Pad\'e approximation increases, the accuracy of the response also increases. The oscillations are increased on a much smaller scale rather than having one big dip in the negative region (as observed in the first few orders of Pad\'e approximation), and the approximation tries to synchronize with the desired response curve in the positive region. All the simulations are done in MATLAB.},

The analytical models considered include the contact force-based linear spring, Kelvin and Hertz models, and the restitution-based stereomechanical approach. In addition, a contact model based on the Hertz law and using a non-linear hysteresis damper (Hertzdamp model) is also introduced for pounding simulation. Simple analytical approaches are presented to determine the impact stiffness parameters of the various contact models. Parameter studies are performed using two degree-of-freedom linear oscillators to determine the effects of impact modelling strategy, system period ratio, peak ground acceleration (PGA) and energy loss during impact on the system responses. A suite of 27 ground motion records from 13 different earthquakes is used in the analysis. The results indicate that the system displacements from the stereomechanical, Kelvin and Hertzdamp models are similar for a given coefficient of restitution, despite using different impact methodologies. Pounding increases the responses of the stiffer system, especially for highly out-of-phase systems. Energy loss during impact is more significant at higher levels of PGA. Based on the findings, the Hertz model provides adequate results at low PGA levels, and the Hertzdamp model is recommended at moderate and high PGA levels.

  abstract = {Dexterous manipulation with a highly redundant movement system is one of the hallmarks of human motor skills. From numerous behavioral studies, there is strong evidence that humans employ compliant task space control, i.e. they focus control only on task variables while keeping redundant degrees-of-freedom as compliant as possible. This strategy is robust towards unknown disturbances and simultaneously safe for the operator and the environment. The theory of operational space control in robotics aims to achieve similar performance properties. However, despite various compelling theoretical lines of research, advanced operational space control is hardly found in actual robotics implementations, in particular new kinds of robots like humanoids and service robots, which would strongly profit from compliant dexterous manipulation. To analyze the pros and cons of different approaches to operational space control, this paper focuses on a theoretical and empirical evaluation of different methods that have been suggested in the literature, but also some new variants of operational space controllers. We address formulations at the velocity, acceleration, and force levels. First, we formulate all controllers in a common notational framework, including quaternion-based orientation control, and discuss some of their theoretical properties. Second, we present experimental comparisons of these approaches on a seven-degree-of-freedom anthropomorphic robot arm with several benchmark tasks. As an aside, we also introduce a novel parameter estimation algorithm for rigid body dynamics, which ensures physical consistency, as this issue was crucial for our successful robot implementations. Our extensive empirical results demonstrate that one of the simplified acceleration-based approaches can be advantageous in terms of task performance, ease of parameter tuning, and general robustness and compliance in the face of inevitable modeling errors.},

For the ``soft-sphere'' mechanism of particle interactions, there are several models for normal contact forces, namely linear spring\textendash dashpot, and non-linear damped Hertzian spring\textendash dashpot, among others. The focus of this paper is to determine the normal spring stiffness coefficient of the linear model through the numerical solution for the overlap between particles in non-linear models. The linear spring stiffness is determined using equivalence between the linear and the nonlinear models. Using the MFIX computational code, the proposed approach is applied in the numerical simulations of two problems: single freely falling particle and bubbling fluidized bed. A method based on mean dimensionless overlap is suggested as an initial estimate to determine the normal spring stiffness coefficient. Other possible methods for computing the stiffness coefficient are also discussed in this work, e.g., maximum dimensionless overlap and dimensionless contact duration.},

  abstract = {The empirical success of Reinforcement Learning (RL) in the setting of contact-rich manipulation leaves much to be understood from a model-based perspective, where the key difficulties are often attributed to (i) the explosion of contact modes, (ii) stiff, non-smooth contact dynamics and the resulting exploding / discontinuous gradients, and (iii) the non-convexity of the planning problem. The stochastic nature of RL addresses (i) and (ii) by effectively sampling and averaging the contact modes. On the other hand, model-based methods have tackled the same challenges by smoothing contact dynamics analytically. Our first contribution is to establish the theoretical equivalence of the two methods for simple systems, and provide qualitative and empirical equivalence on a number of complex examples. In order to further alleviate (ii), our second contribution is a convex, differentiable and quasi-dynamic formulation of contact dynamics, which is amenable to both smoothing schemes, and has proven through experiments to be highly effective for contact-rich planning. Our final contribution resolves (iii), where we show that classical sampling-based motion planning algorithms can be effective in global planning when contact modes are abstracted via smoothing. Applying our method on a collection of challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks, we demonstrate that efficient model-based motion planning can achieve results comparable to RL with dramatically less computation.

We show how a frequently-updating, continually-verifying controller can guarantee safety of nearby humans in a formal way while maintaining efficiency of the robot. Two different models of the human behaviour are presented: a model based on extreme human motion as specified in ISO standards, and another, kinematic model parametrised by test data from a range of human subjects performing extreme movements. We implement the controller in an experimental setup, and find that both models allow the robot to work efficiently when the human is safe and stop when the human is in danger of colliding with the robot; the ISO-based model is less cautious and sometimes does not account for fast human motion. The kinematic model, which accounts for all motion, is more restrictive towards robot motion but nevertheless allows the robot to operate when the human is not in danger.},

The human body is composed of joints and links, suiting approximation by a kinematic chain, but the control strategy of the human is completely unknown, meaning the potential occupancy grows very fast and it is difficult to compute tightly in real time. As such, most previous work considers only specific, known, or probable movements, and usually does not account for a range of human dimensions. Focusing on the human arm, we analyze archetypal movements performed by test subjects to create a dynamic model. Motion-capture data of subjects are fitted, for modeling purposes, to two abstractions: a 4-degree of freedom (DOF) model and a 3-DOF model, to obtain dynamic parameters. We validate our approach on movements from a publicly available database. The prediction is shown to be computationally fast, and reachable sets of the abstraction are shown to enclose all possible future occupancies of the arm for different subjects, tightly but overapproximatively. The 3DOF model has advantages over the 4-DOF in terms of speed, though the 4-DOF model is tighter at smaller time horizons. Such an overapproximative representation is intended for certifiable safety-guaranteed collision avoidance algorithms for robots.},

Moreover, when human operators physically interact with the robot during work, strict safety measures become necessary with some of these including power and force limitations. In this paper, a novel impedance control technique for collaborative robots is presented. The featured controller allows a safe human-robot interaction through energy and power limitations, assuring passivity through energy-tanks.

  abstract = {Industrial-sized hybrid systems are typically not amenable to formal verification techniques. For this reason, a common approach is to formally verify abstractions of (parts of) the original system. However, we need to show that this abstraction conforms to the actual system implementation including its physical dynamics. In particular, verified properties of the abstract system need to transfer to the implementation. To this end, we introduce a formal conformance relation, called reachset conformance, which guarantees transference of safety properties, while being a weaker relation than the existing trace inclusion conformance. Based on this formal relation, we present a conformance testing method which allows us to tune the trade-off between accuracy and computational load. Additionally, we present a test selection algorithm that uses a coverage measure to reduce the number of test cases for conformance testing. We experimentally show the benefits of our novel techniques based on an example from autonomous driving.},

Within the Industry 4.0 paradigm, the robot complements the human's capabilities, learning new tasks and adapting itself to compensate for uncertainties. With this aim, the presented paper focuses on the investigation of machine learning techniques to make a sensorless robot able to learn and optimize an industrial assembly task. Relying on sensorless Cartesian impedance control, two main contributions are defined: (1) a task-trajectory learning algorithm based on a few human's demonstrations (exploiting Hidden Markov Model approach), and (2) an autonomous optimization procedure of the task execution (exploiting Bayesian Optimization). To validate the proposed methodology, an assembly task has been selected as a reference application. The task consists of mounting a gear into its square-section shaft on a fixed base to simulate the assembly of a gearbox. A Franka EMIKA Panda manipulator has been used as a test platform, implementing the proposed methodology. The experiments, carried out on a population of 15 subjects, show the effectiveness of the proposed strategy, making the robot able to learn and optimize its behavior to accomplish the assembly task, even in the presence of task uncertainties.},

We show how a novel form of transformer network can be used to map from images and video directly to an overhead map or bird's-eye-view (BEV) of the world, in a single end-to-end network. We assume a 1-1 correspondence between a vertical scanline in the image, and rays passing through the camera location in an overhead map. This lets us formulate map generation from an image as a set of sequence-to-sequence translations. Posing the problem as translation allows the network to use the context of the image when interpreting the role of each pixel. This constrained formulation, based upon a strong physical grounding of the problem, leads to a restricted transformer network that is convolutional in the horizontal direction only. The structure allows us to make efficient use of data when training, and obtains state-of-the-art results for instantaneous mapping of three large-scale datasets, including a 15\% and 30\% relative gain against existing best performing methods on the nuScenes and Argoverse datasets, respectively.

This paper discusses a new control approach for robotic-assisted tele-echography. The control architecture follows a hierarchical approach, where explicit Cartesian force control arises as the primary task while orientation control is designed in the null space. The robot dynamics is driven by a 3-D time-of-flight camera and a force sensor. Based on depth camera and force data, contact stiffness is anticipated, allowing control adaptation before contact. This approach is adequate for tele-echographic tasks since it reduces robot dynamics before contact, enabling a smooth transition from free space to contact and vice versa. In contact, the environment stiffness is estimated online using force data and the manipulator inertial properties. A strong correlation between the stiffness perceived by the controller and the effective mass exists, being this correlation used in the estimation algorithm to improve force control performance. A set of experiments assess the control architecture, highlighting the relation between perceived stiffness and robot effective mass, including also clinical validation. Note to Practitioners\textemdash The teleoperation control architecture described in this paper relies on computed-torque techniques that take into account robot dynamics, contact stiffness estimation, task-space formulation, and null-space design. Our application is on the medical field, where a physician telecontrols a robot to obtain ultrasound images from a patient. The robot exhibits compliant behaviors in Cartesian space (for safety reasons) managed by the task-space formulation, and stiffer behaviors in orientation control managed by null-space design. This approach allows accurate orientation control with compliant positioning which is adequate for this type of teleoperation tasks. Due to free space and contact interactions, the proposed control approach anticipates the contact stiffness relying on vision sensing, adapting the control gains accordingly. While in contact, the perceived stiffness has a strong correlation with the effective mass, which is used together with force data for its estimation. This strategy allows slowing down robot dynamics toward contact, guaranteeing a smooth behavior, entailing also high-quality force tracking while in contact. All control details are described in this paper, allowing easy implementation not only for this specific context, but also for other telemanipulation architectures that require remote delicate handling, without jeopardizing force control and orientation control performances.},

This article presents two simple on-line schemes for force tracking within the impedance-control framework. The force- tracking capability of impedance control is particularly important for providing robustness in the presence of large uncertainties or variations in environmental parameters. The two proposed schemes generate the reference position trajec tory required to produce a desired contact force despite lack of knowledge of the environmental stiffness and location. The first scheme uses direct adaptive control to generate the refer ence position on-line as a function of the force-tracking error. Alternatively, the second scheme utilizes an indirect adaptive strategy in which the environmental parameters are estimated on-line, and the required reference position is computed based on these estimates. In both schemes, adaptation allows au tomatic gain adjustment to provide a uniform performance despite variations in the environmental parameters. Simula tion studies are presented for a 7-DOF Robotics Research arm using full arm dynamics, demonstrating that the adaptive schemes are able to compensate for uncertainties in both the environmental stiffness and location. The simulation studies also highlight the limitations of pure impedance control without the force-tracking capability for robust execution of realistic contact tasks. Experimental results are also presented for the Robotics Research arm to demonstrate that the end effector applies the desired contact force while exhibiting the specified impedance dynamics.},

Both models include the contact deformation of the plate and the impactor as well as bending, transverse shear, and membrane deformations of the plate. The plate was a transversely isotropic graphite/epoxy composite laminate and the impactor was a steel sphere. In the energy-balance model, a balance equation was derived by equating the kinetic energy of the impactor to the sum of the strain energies due to contact, bending, transverse shear, and membrane deformations at maximum deflection. The resulting equation was solved using the Newton-Raphson numerical technique. The energy-balance model yields only the maximum force; hence a less simple spring-mass model is presented to calculate the force history. In the spring-mass model, the impactor and the plate were represented by two rigid masses and their deformations were represented by springs. Springs define the elastic contact and plate deformation characteristics. Equations of equilibrium of the resulting two degree-of-freedom system, subjected to an initial velocity, were obtained from Newton's second law of motion. The two coupled nonlinear differential equations were solved using Adam's numerical integration technique. Calculated impact forces from the two analyses agreed with each other. The analyses were verified by comparing the results with reported test data.},

This PID control scheme, proposed with PD variable gains and fixed integral gains, improves the performance of the transient response and the handling of constraints, such as the limits of the actuator torques. Based on the authors experience, our proposal is the first scheme of a nonlinear PID regulator for robot manipulators whose PD gains are variable and its stability proof is global asymptotic in the sense of Lyapunov. The PD variable gains are directly dependent on the joint position errors and are fine tuned by fuzzy logic methodology. Good results were obtained on an experimental direct-drive robot arm of two degrees of freedom, when it was tested in order to verify the effectiveness of the new controller.},

  abstract = {The increasing use of soft materials in robotics applications requires the development of mathematical models to describe their viscoelastic and nonlinear properties. The traditional linear viscoelastic models are unable to describe nonlinear strain-dependent behaviors. This limitation has been addressed by implementing a piecewise linearization (PL) in the simplest viscoelastic model, the Standard Linear Solid (SLS). In this work, we aim to implement the PL in a more complex model, the Wiechert model and compare the stress response of both linearized models. Therefore, the experimental data from the stress relaxation and tensile strength tests of six rubber-based materials is used to approximate the spring and dashpot constants of the SLS and the Wiechert model. Prior to implement the PL into the stress-strain curve of each material, the stress response from the Maxwell branches must be subtracted from this curve. By using the parameters obtained from fitting the Wiechert model into the stress relaxation curve, the response of both linearized models was improved. Due to the selection of constitutive equations evaluated, the linearized SLS model described the stress-strain curve more accurately. Finally, this work describes in details every step of the fitting process and highlights the benefits of using linearization methods to improve known models as an alternative of using highly complex models to describe the mechanical properties of soft materials.},

The recent trends have seen robots perform tasks earlier left for humans, such as massage, and in the classical tasks, such as peg-in-hole, there is a more efficient generalization to other similar tasks, better error tolerance, and faster planning or learning of the tasks.

All tests have been carried out using a specially designed friction simulator. The test material was a 0.8-mm-thick DC04 steel sheet, commonly used in the automotive industry. Uniaxial tensile tests have been carried out to characterise the mechanical properties of the specimens. Furthermore, measurements of the sheet surface topography have been carried out to characterise the tribological properties of the specimens. The friction tests have been conducted under different pressure and lubrication conditions, surface roughnesses of tools represented by counter-samples, and orientations of the specimens according to the direction of the sheet rolling. A comparative analysis of the results of the friction tests revealed different values of friction. In the strip drawing test, the value of the coefficient of friction decreases as the contact pressure increases for both dry and lubricated conditions. In the draw bead test, the specimens oriented along the rolling direction demonstrated a higher value of the coefficient of friction compared to the samples cut transverse to the rolling direction. In contrast to the strip drawing test, the specimens tested in the bending under tension test exhibit a tendency to an increase in the value of the coefficient of friction with the increasing contact pressure.},

  abstract = {Interior point algorithms for solving linear programs have been studied extensively for a long time [e.g. Karmarkar 1984; Lee, Sidford FOCS'14; Cohen, Lee, Song STOC'19]. For linear programs of the form minAx=b,x{$\geq$}0 c+x with n variables and d constraints, the generic case d = {$\Omega$}(n) has recently been settled by Cohen, Lee and Song [STOC'19]. Their algorithm can solve linear programs in \~O(n{$\omega$} log(n/{$\delta$})) expected time1, where {$\delta$} is the relative accuracy. This is essentially optimal as all known linear system solvers require up to O(n{$\Omega$}) time for solving Ax = b. However, for the case of deterministic solvers, the best upper bound is Vaidya's 30 years old O(n2.5 log(n/{$\delta$})) bound [FOCS'89]. In this paper we show that one can also settle the deterministic setting by derandomizing Cohen et al.'s \~O(n{$\omega$} log(n/{$\delta$}))) time algorithm. This allows for a strict \~O(n{$\omega$} log(n/{$\delta$})) time bound, instead of an expected one, and a simplified analysis, reducing the length of their proof of their central path method by roughly half. Derandomizing this algorithm was also an open question asked in Song's PhD Thesis. The main tool to achieve our result is a new data-structure that can maintain the solution to a linear system in subquadratic time. More accurately we are able to maintain [MATH HERE] in subquadratic time under l2 multiplicative changes to the diagonal matrix U and the vector v. This type of change is common for interior point algorithms. Previous algorithms [e.g. Vaidya STOC'89; Lee, Sidford FOCS'15; Cohen, Lee, Song STOC'19] required {$\Omega$}(n2) time for this task. In [Cohen, Lee, Song STOC'19] they managed to maintain the matrix [MATH HERE] in sub-quadratic time, but multiplying it with a dense vector to solve the linear system still required {$\Omega$}(n2) time. To improve the complexity of their linear program solver, they restricted the solver to only multiply sparse vectors via a random sampling argument. In comparison, our data-structure maintains the entire product [MATH HERE] additionally to just the matrix. Interestingly, this can be viewed as a simple modification of Cohen et al.'s data-structure, but it significantly simplifies their analysis of their central path method and makes their whole algorithm deterministic.}

The ability to systematically compare robotic system performance and quantify true advancement in fine manipulation is of utmost importance. Accordingly, the objectives of this paper are threefold: 1) creation of a peg-in-hole test method with associated performance metrics and a systematic data analysis strategy for performance benchmarking, 2) first demonstration of a recently developed manipulation controller piloting a robotic hand and its paired task-level logic for completing the peg-in-hole test, and 3) exemplifying the performance benchmarking technique by comparing two approaches for robotic insertions-the previously mentioned compliant hand, stiff arm system, and a stiff gripper, compliant arm system. Analyses reveal that the unconventional hand system can perform at and sometimes above the level of the gripper system in the developed peg-in-hole scenario. Moreover, the hand's active control of the peg's full Cartesian pose reduces positional error sensitivity and minimizes exerted insertion forces, highlighting the strategy's potential for fine manipulation tasks. Results indicate that robotic arms equipped with highly articulated and sensorized robotic hands can provide a truly realizable solution path for performing peg-in-hole tasks.},

Computer simulations play an important role in the design and validation of constrained robotic operations. The fidelity of these simulations, however, depends on the specification of contact dynamics parameters, which often need to be determined experimentally. In this paper we investigate the identification of contact parameters from complex stiff multi-point contact scenarios encountered in typical robotic operations using a recently developed least-squares-based method. This method is extended to deal with geometric uncertainties by employing a non-linear separable least-squares formulation. The latter is solved using a variable projection method, and allows simultaneous identification of contact parameters and geometric uncertainties. The conditions for observability of geometric uncertainties are derived and a regularized formulation is proposed in case the identification of geometric uncertainties is ill-conditioned. The applicability of the original method and the benefits of the extended method with identification of geometric uncertainties for the identification of the contact parameters are illustrated by means of experimental data measured with the Special Purpose Dexterous Manipulator (SPDM) Task Verification Facility (STVF) manipulator at the Canadian Space Agency (CSA).},

Our approach is based on the use of a recently proposed interval-arithmetic-based recursive NewtonEuler algorithm. This algorithm enables the efficient numerical computation of over-approximative sets of torques/forces arising from uncertain model parameters. The over-approximative nature of these sets is exploited in this work in order to provide a formally robust trajectory scaling and collision detection strategy.

  abstract = {In this paper, we review and compare four algorithms for the identification of contact stiffness and damping during robot constrained motion. The intended application is dynamics modeling and simulation of robotic assembly operations in space. Accurate simulation of these tasks requires contact dynamics models, which in turn use contact stiffness and damping to calculate contact forces. Hence, our primary interest in identifying contact parameters stems from their use as inputs to simulation software with contact dynamics capability. Estimates of environmental stiffness and damping are also valuable for force tracking and stability of impedance controllers. The algorithms considered in this work include: a signal processing method, an indirect adaptive controller with modifications to identify environment damping, a model reference adaptive controller and a recursive least-squares estimation technique. The last three methods have been proposed for real-time implementation in impedance and force-tracking controllers. The signal processing scheme uses a frequency estimate calculated with fast Fourier transform of the force signal and is an off-line method. The algorithms are first evaluated using numerical simulation of a benchmark test. Experiments conducted with a robotic arm contacting a flexible wall provide a further demonstration of their performance. Our results indicate that the indirect adaptive controller has the best combination of performance and ease of use. In addition, the effect of persistently exciting signals is discussed.

The validity of computer simulation depends not only on the underlying mathematical models but also on the model parameters. This paper describes a novel strategy of identifying contact dynamics parameters based on the sensor data collected from a robot performing contact tasks. Unlike existing identification algorithms, this methodology is applicable to complex contact geometries where contact between mating objects occurs at multiple surface areas in a time-variant fashion. At the same time, the procedure requires only measurements of end-effector forces/moments and the kinematics information for the end-effector and the environment. Similarly to other methods, the solution is formulated as a linear identification problem, which can be solved with standard numerical techniques for overdetermined systems. Efficacy, precision, and sensitivity of the identification methodology are investigated in simulation with two examples: A cube sliding in a wedge and a payload/fixture combination modeled after a real space-manipulator task.},

Key challenges include the complex and unpredictable nature of the real world in which assistant and service robots operate, the limitations on available V\&V techniques when used individually, and the consequent lack of confidence in the V\&V results. Our approach, called corroborative V\&V, addresses these challenges by combining several different V\&V techniques; in this paper we use formal verification (model checking), simulation-based testing, and user validation in experiments with a real robot. This combination of approaches allows V\&V of the human\textendash robot interaction task at different levels of modeling detail and thoroughness of exploration, thus overcoming the individual limitations of each technique. We demonstrate our approach through a handover task, the most critical part of a complex cooperative manufacturing scenario, for which we propose safety and liveness requirements to verify and validate. Should the resulting V\&V evidence present discrepancies, an iterative process between the different V\&V techniques takes place until corroboration between the V\&V techniques is gained from refining and improving the assets (i.e., system and requirement models) to represent the human\textendash robot interaction task in a more truthful manner.

The main reason for this is probably that current approaches are not push-buttoncapable and still require to manually set crucial parameters, such as time step sizes and the accuracy of the used set representation\textemdash these settings require expert knowledge. We present a generic framework to automatically find near-optimal parameters for reachability analysis of linear systems given a user-defined accuracy. To limit the computational overhead as much as possible, our methods tune all relevant parameters during runtime. We evaluate our approach on benchmarks from the ARCH competition as well as on random examples. The results show that our new framework verifies the selected benchmarks faster than manually-tuned parameters and is an order of magnitude faster compared to genetic algorithms.},

The tuning is especially difficult in the context of nonlinear systems where over-approximation errors accumulate over time due to the so-called wrapping effect, often requiring expert knowledge. In order to widen the applicability of reachability analysis for practitioners, we propose the first adaptive parameter tuning approach for reachability analysis of nonlinear continuous systems tuning all algorithm parameters. Our modular approach can be applied to different reachability algorithms as well as various set representations. Finally, an evaluation on numerous benchmark systems shows that the adaptive parameter tuning approach efficiently computes very tight enclosures of reachable sets.},

We track a belief over the system state using a particle filter from which we extract a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). This compressed representation of the belief is used to automatically create a discrete set of goal-directed motion controllers. A reinforcement learning agent then switches between these motion controllers in real-time to accomplish the manipulation task. The proposed system closes the loop from joint sensor feedback to high-frequency, accelerationlimited position commands, thus eliminating the need for preand post-processing. We evaluate our approach with respect to five distinct manipulation tasks from the domains of active localization, grasping under uncertainty, assembly, and nonprehensile object manipulation. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the hierarchical policy actively exploits the uncertainty information encoded in the compressed belief. Finally, we validate the proposed method on a real-world robot.},

This poses a substantial challenge due to high-dimensional state spaces and non-linear contact-dynamics. Furthermore, object poses and model parameters, such as friction, are not exactly known and a source of uncertainty. The method proposed in this paper models the task of parts assembly as a belief space planning problem over an underlying impedance-controlled, compliant system. To solve this planning problem we introduce an asymptotically optimal belief space planner by extending an optimal, randomized, kinodynamic motion planner to nondeterministic domains. Under an expansiveness assumption we establish probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality. We validate our approach in thorough, simulated and realworld experiments of multiple assembly tasks. The experiments demonstrate our planner's ability to reliably assemble objects, solely based on CAD models as input.},

  abstract = {A gene regulatory network can be considered a dynamic cellular system which describes the behavior (development) of a living cell and depends completely on the current internal state plus any external inputs, if these exist. Although many details inside a cell are not precisely known, gene expression data on a genome scale provide useful insights into such a cellular system. With gene expression data, a wide variety of models, such as Boolean networks and differential/difference equations, have been proposed to model gene regulatory networks. In these previously proposed models, genes are viewed as the internal state variables of a cellular system. This viewpoint has suffered from the underestimation of the model parameters. In addition, these models ignore an important problem with a gene regulatory network - time delay. Instead, this paper proposes a state-space model with time delays for gene regulatory, networks. The proposed model views genes as the observation variables, whose expression values depend on the current internal state variables and any external inputs. Bayesian information criterion (BIC) and probabilistic principal component analysis (PPCA) are used to estimate the number of internal state variables and their expression profiles from gene expression data. By constructing dynamic equations with time delays for the internal state variables and the relationships between the internal state variables and the observation variables (gene expression profiles), state-space models with time delays for gene regulatory networks are constructed. The parameters of the proposed model can be unambiguously identified from time-course gene expression data with a lower computational cost. The proposed model is applied to two time-course gene expression datasets, and two gene regulatory networks are inferred, respectively. The analysis shows that the inferred gene regulatory networks have several features of the real gene regulatory networks, such as the stability, the robustness, and the periodicity. Further, compared to state-space models without time delays, the proposed model with time delays has better prediction accuracy.},

Manual palpation of tissue and organs during a surgical procedure provides clinicians with valuable information for diagnosis and surgical planning. In present-day robotassisted minimally invasive surgery systems, lack of perceptible haptic feedback makes it challenging to detect a tumor in an organ or a calcified artery in heart tissue. This study presents an automated tissue property estimation method and a real-time graphical overlay that allow an operator to discriminate hard and soft tissues. We first evaluate experimentally the properties of an artificial tissue and compare seven possible mathematical tissue models. Self-validation as well as cross-validation confirm that the Hunt-Crossley model best describes the experimentally observed phantom tissue properties and is suitable for our purpose. Second, we present the development of a system in which the phantom tissue is palpated using a teleoperated surgical robot, and the stiffness of the Hunt-Crossly model is estimated in real time by recursive least squares. A real-time visual overlay representing tissue stiffness is created using a hue-saturation-luminance representation on a semi-transparent disc at the tissue surface. Hue depicts the stiffness at a palpated point and saturation is calculated based on distance from the point. A simple interpolation technique creates a continuous stiffness color map. In an experiment, the graphical overlay successfully shows the location of an artificial calcified artery hidden in phantom tissue.},

In this letter, we first present the end-to-end admittance control formulation that represents the direct relationship between the generalized velocity and interaction wrench measurement when they satisfy the desired admittance property. Based on this formulation, we then develop a sampling-based algorithm for directly computing the robot reference motion without using the actual location of the interaction or the additional inverse kinematics step that is typically required for task-space admittance control. The algorithm is demonstrated in a number of simulation examples including collisions with a moving object and fixed obstacle.},

  abstract = {The flexibility of the robot assembly process is critical, and a robot assembly system that is not flexible may damage the workpieces. Most researchers make the assembly process flexible by installing a six-dimensional force/torque sensor at the end of robots, but doing so will result in an increase in the costs of the robotic assembly system. To this end, this paper proposes an external force/torque calculation algorithm based on dynamic model identification to replace the six-dimensional force/torque sensor; the algorithm can reduce the costs while achieving a flexible assembly. In this paper, the impedance model of the environment and the dynamic model of the robot with friction are unified. Based on the unified model, the virtual contact surface is proposed to optimize the assembly. To ensure the accuracy of the assembly, the compliant control method of this paper uses the PD-based position control as the control inner loop and the impedance control as the control outer loop. To verify the accuracy of the compliant control method, a 6-DOF series collaborative robot which is developed in our laboratory is used to complete the peg-in-hole assembly experiment. The experimental results show that the algorithm has good flexibility and positional accuracy.},

Therefore, it cannot detect short impacts (extremely short time interval) sensitively. According to the frequency distribution of modeling errors, collision signal, and measurement noise, we design three different second-order model-based GMOs, which improve the performance of collision detection effectively. Specifically, these GMOs include a second-order damped system (abbreviated as Damp), a second-order damped system with PD regulation (abbreviated as PD), and a band-pass filter (abbreviated as BPF). Typically, the collision reaction function can be realized by switching to the torque control mode with gravity compensation. However, the robot cannot continue to move along its original trajectories after switching from position to torque control, and cannot continue to perform subsequent tasks. To address this problem, we design a collision reaction strategy in position control mode by mapping the output of the observer to the increment of joint velocity, realizing a safe collision reaction.},
