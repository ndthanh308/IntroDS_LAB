  "abstract": "Verifying the correct behavior of robots in contact tasks is challenging due to model uncertainties associated with contacts. Standard methods for testing often fall short since all (uncountable many) solutions cannot be obtained. Instead, we propose to formally and efficiently verify robot behaviors in contact tasks using reachability analysis, which enables checking all the reachable states against user-provided specifications. To this end, we extend the state of the art in reachability analysis for hybrid (mixed discrete and continuous) dynamics subject to discrete-time input trajectories. In particular, we present a novel and scalable guard intersection approach to reliably compute the complex behavior caused by contacts. We model robots subject to contacts as hybrid automata in which crucial time delays are included. The usefulness of our approach is demonstrated by verifying safe human-robot interaction in the presence of constrained collisions, which was out of reach for existing methods.",
