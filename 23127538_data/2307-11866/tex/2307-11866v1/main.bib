abstract = {Flash-based solid state drives (SSDs) have gained a central role in the infrastructure of large-scale datacenters, as well as in commodity servers and personal devices. The main limitation of flash media is its inability to support update-in-place: after data has been written to a physical location, it has to be erased before new data can be written to it. Moreover, SSDs support read and write operations in granularity of pages, while erasures are performed on entire blocks, which often contain hundreds of pages. When erasing a block, any valid data it stores must be rewritten to a clean location. As an SSD eventually wears out with progressing number of erasures, the efficiency of the management algorithm has a significant impact on its endurance. In this paper we first formally define the SSD management problem. We then explore this problem from an algorithmic perspective, considering it in both offline and online settings. In the offline setting, we present a near-optimal algorithm that, given any input, performs a negligible number of rewrites (relative to the input length). We also discuss the hardness of the offline problem. In the online setting, we first consider algorithms that have no prior knowledge about the input. We prove that no deterministic algorithm outperforms the greedy algorithm in this setting, and discuss the possible benefit of randomization. We then augment our model, assuming that each request for a page arrives with a prediction of the next time the page is updated. We design an online algorithm that uses such predictions, and show that its performance improves as the prediction error decreases. We also show that the performance of our algorithm is never worse than that guaranteed by the greedy algorithm, even when the prediction error is large. We complement our theoretical findings with an empirical evaluation of our algorithms, comparing them with the state-of-the-art scheme. The results confirm that our algorithms exhibit an improved performance for a wide range of input traces.},

abstract = {Garbage collection (GC) algorithms for flash-based solid-state drives (SSDs) have a profound impact on its performance and many studies have focused on assessing the so-called write amplification of various GC algorithms. In this article, we consider the family of d-choices GC algorithms and study (a) the extent in which these algorithms induce unequal wear and (b) the manner in which they affect the lifetime of the drive. For this purpose, we introduce two performance measures: PE fairness and SSD endurance. We study the impact of the d-choices GC algorithm on both these measures under different workloads (uniform, synthetic and trace-based) when combined with two different write modes. Numerical results show that the more complex of the two write modes, which requires hot/cold data identification, may not necessarily give rise to a significantly better SSD endurance. Further, the d-choices GC algorithm is often shown to strike a good balance between garbage collection and wear leveling for small d values (e.g., d = 10), yielding high endurance.},

abstract = {Host-managed shingled magnetic recording drives (HM-SMR) are advantageous in capacity to harness the explosive growth of data. For key-value (KV) stores based on log-structured merge trees (LSM-trees), the HM-SMR drive is an ideal solution owning to its capacity, predictable performance, and economical cost. However, building an LSM-tree-based KV store on HM-SMR drives presents severe challenges in maintaining the performance and space utilization efficiency due to the redundant cleaning processes for applications and storage devices (i.e., compaction and garbage collection). To eliminate the overhead of on-disk garbage collection (GC) and improve compaction efficiency, this article presents GearDB, a GC-free KV store tailored for HM-SMR drives. GearDB improves the write performance and space efficiency through three new techniques: a new on-disk data layout, compaction windows, and a novel gear compaction algorithm. We further augment the read performance of GearDB with a new SSTable&nbsp;layout and read ahead mechanism. We implement GearDB with LevelDB, and use zonefs to access a real HM-SMR drive. Our extensive experiments confirm that GearDB achieves both high performance and space efficiency, i.e., on average 1.7\texttimes{} and 1.5\texttimes{} better than LevelDB in random write and read, respectively, with up to 86.9\% space efficiency.},

abstract = {Zoned namespaces (ZNS) is an emerging storage abstraction with the potential to supersede the conventional block abstraction for flash-based devices. ZNS constrains the writes to be sequential within each zone, thereby avoiding a costly translation in the device. We uncover an additional opportunity afforded by sequential writing: device-level support for storing variable-size pieces of data. We argue that adding this support would be a useful and natural extension of ZNS. First, we identify several cases where file and database systems would benefit from storing variable-size pieces of data. Second, we sketch some simple options for extending the ZNS specification and for implementing the extension within an SSD. Such an extension would add little, if any, cost and complexity, thus preserving the lean characteristic of ZNS.},

abstract = {The Log-Structured Merge (LSM) tree is considered well-suited to zoned namespace (ZNS) storage devices since the write requests to LSM-tree is sequential. However, zones can be partially invalidated and be fragmented during LSM-tree compaction. The partially-invalid zones cannot be utilized and thus space amplification becomes significant. To reclaim the invalid space, host-managed garbage collection (GC) is required, which increases the write amplification of ZNS storage and degrades I/O performance. We introduce a lifetime-leveling compaction (LL-compaction) tailored for ZNS SSD, which can alleviate space amplification without GC by making the sorted string tables in a zone have similar lifetimes. In our experiments using LevelDB, the LL-compaction achieved 1.7x better performance by removing GCs.},

abstract = {Unlike traditional block-based SSDs, Zoned Namespace (ZNS) SSDs expose storage through the zoned block interface, completely eliminating the need for in-device garbage collection (GC) and relinquishing this responsibility to applications. As a result, application-aware data placement decisions give the opportunity for applications on the host to perform efficient GC. Meanwhile, RocksDB for ZNS SSD places data with similar invalidation times (lifetimes) in the same zone through ZenFS (a user-level file system) using the Lifetime-based Zone Allocation algorithm (LIZA), and minimizes the GC overhead of valid data copy when reclaiming a zone. However, LIZA, which allocates zones by predicting the lifetime of each SSTable according to the level of the hierarchical structure of the LSM-tree, is very inefficient in minimizing the write amplification (WA) problem due to inaccurate predictions of SSTable lifetimes. Instead, based on our observation that the deletion time of SSTables in the LSM-tree is solely determined by the compaction process, we propose a novel Compaction-Aware Zone Allocation algorithm (CAZA) that allows the newly created SSTables to be deleted together after merging in the future. CAZA is implemented in RocksDB's ZenFS and our extensive evaluations show that CAZA significantly reduces the WA overhead compared to LIZA.},

@inproceedings{2012-asplos-moneta,
 abstract = {Emerging fast, non-volatile memories (e.g., phase change memories, spin-torque MRAMs, and the memristor) reduce storage access latencies by an order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art flash-based SSDs. This improved performance means that software overheads that had little impact on the performance of flash-based systems can present serious bottlenecks in systems that incorporate these new technologies. We describe a novel storage hardware and software architecture that nearly eliminates two sources of this overhead: Entering the kernel and performing file system permission checks. The new architecture provides a private, virtualized interface for each process and moves file system protection checks into hardware. As a result, applications can access file data without operating system intervention, eliminating OS and file system costs entirely for most accesses. We describe the support the system provides for fast permission checks in hardware, our approach to notifying applications when requests complete, and the small, easily portable changes required in the file system to support the new access model. Existing applications require no modification to use the new interface. We evaluate the performance of the system using a suite of microbenchmarks and database workloads and show that the new interface improves latency and bandwidth for 4 KB writes by 60% and 7.2x, respectively, OLTP database transaction throughput by up to 2.0x, and Berkeley-DB throughput by up to 5.7x. A streamlined asynchronous file IO interface built to fully utilize the new interface enables an additional 5.5x increase in throughput with 1 thread and 2.8x increase in efficiency for 512 B transfers.},

enabler is Moore's Law scaling augmented by multiple self aligned techniques. Another key one is multilevel-cell technology giving 2 bits of information in a single cell. With emergence of NAND at much lower cost, NOR flash market is projected not to grow but NOR is still dominant memory for
BIOS and program store in many electronic devices.},

@articel{2020-Ma-Flash_Memory_Bit_Errors,
 abstract = {Cells wear fast in NAND flash memory of high storage density (HSD), so it is very necessary to have a long-term frequent in-time monitoring on its raw bit error rate (RBER) changes through a fast RBER estimation method. As the flash of HSD already has relatively lower reading speed, the method should not further degrade its read performance. This paper proposes an improved estimation method utilizing known data comparison, includes interleaving to balance the uneven error distribution in the flash of HSD, a fast RBER estimation module to make the estimated RBER highly linearly correlated with the actual RBER, and enhancement strategies to accelerate the decoding convergence of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and thereby make up the rate penalty caused by the known data. Experimental results show that when RBER is close to the upper bound of LDPC code, the reading efficiency can be increased by 35.8% compared to the case of no rate penalty. The proposed method only occupies 0.039mm2 at 40nm process condition. Hence, the fast, read-performance-improving, and low-cost method is of great application potential on RBER monitoring in the flash of HSD.},

@techreport{kitchenham2007guidelines,
 abstract = {The objective of this report is to propose comprehensive guidelines for systematic literature reviews appropriate for software engineering researchers, including PhD students. A systematic literature review is a means of evaluating and interpreting all available research relevant to a particular research question, topic area, or phenomenon of interest. Systematic reviews aim to present a fair evaluation of a research topic by using a trustworthy, rigorous, and auditable methodology. The guidelines presented in this report were derived from three existing guidelines used by medical researchers, two books produced by researchers with social science backgrounds and discussions with researchers from other disciplines who are involved in evidence-based practice. The guidelines have been adapted to reflect the specific problems of software engineering research. The guidelines cover three phases of a systematic literature review: planning the review, conducting the review and reporting the review. They provide a relatively high level description. They do not consider the impact of the research questions on the review procedures, nor do they specify in detail the mechanisms needed to perform meta-analysis.},
