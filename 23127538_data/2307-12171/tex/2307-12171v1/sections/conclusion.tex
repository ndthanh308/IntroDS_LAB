In this work, we present a compression algorithm that can work in real-time on video streams targeted for analytics. The proposed scheme leverages a novel student-teacher framework, and
% in order to achieve efficient semantic compression at the source. Moreover, LtC is unique in the sense that it 
integrates both spatial and temporal compression in a complementary way. In addition to that, LtC significantly outperforms the state of the art proposals in terms of accuracy and bandwidth use. 
% Lastly, we believe that the novel features used in this work will be a useful tool for the future research in this domain.
