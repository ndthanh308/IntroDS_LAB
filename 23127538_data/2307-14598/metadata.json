  "abstract": "We apply a three-dimensional (3D) approach to investigate the quasi-stationary states of well-deformed $α$-emitters. With a splitting of the anisotropic 3D potential into internal and external parts at a separation surface, the 3D $α$-cluster decay width is determined by the initial wave function of a true bound state of an anisotropic harmonic oscillator potential and a non-resonance scattering wave function of Coulomb potential. Substantial difference between the 1D and 3D decay width is found for typical $α$-emitters with large quadrupole and hexadecapole deformations.",
