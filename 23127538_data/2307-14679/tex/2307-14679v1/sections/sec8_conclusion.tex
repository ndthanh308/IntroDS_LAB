\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec: conclusion}

In this paper, we propose a decentralized identity system \sysname, which offers selective disclosure of credentials, Sybil resistance and key recovery. \sysname eliminates identifier-based correlations and prevents any proof forwarding by non-forwardable proofs. To mitigate Sybil attacks, \sysname incorporates an identifier association mechanism that aggregates users' identifiers, preventing anyone from gaining an unfair advantage by registering pseudonyms. To address the issue of key loss, \sysname enables the user to prove ownership of an identifier to the registry to actively update its public key. Evaluations on performance demonstrate the availability and efficiency of \sysname.
