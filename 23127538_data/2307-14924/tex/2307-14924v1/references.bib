	abstract = {We investigate the role of mass infall in the formation and evolution of protostars. To avoid ad hoc initial and boundary conditions, we consider the infall resulting self-consistently from modeling the formation of stellar clusters in turbulent molecular clouds. We show that infall rates in turbulent clouds are comparable to accretion rates inferred from protostellar luminosities or measured in pre-main-sequence stars. They should not be neglected in modeling the luminosity of protostars and the evolution of disks, even after the embedded protostellar phase. We find large variations of infall rates from protostar to protostar, and large fluctuations during the evolution of individual protostars. In most cases, the infall rate is initially of order 10−5 M☉ yr−1, and may either decay rapidly in the formation of low-mass stars, or remain relatively large when more massive stars are formed. The simulation reproduces well the observed characteristic values and scatter of protostellar luminosities and matches the observed protostellar luminosity function. The luminosity problem is therefore solved once realistic protostellar infall histories are accounted for, with no need for extreme accretion episodes. These results are based on a simulation of randomly driven magnetohydrodynamic turbulence on a scale of 4 pc, including self-gravity, adaptive-mesh refinement to a resolution of 50 AU, and accreting sink particles. The simulation yields a low star formation rate, consistent with the observations, and a mass distribution of sink particles consistent with the observed stellar initial mass function during the whole duration of the simulation, forming nearly 1300 sink particles over 3.2Myr.}

The origin of these peaks has often been attributed to binary formation via core and disc fragmentation. However, theory and simulations suggest that young stellar systems that form via core fragmentation undergo significant orbital evolution.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Aims.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We investigate the influence of the environment on the formation and orbital evolution of multiple star systems, and how core fragmentation contributes to the formation of close (20 - 100 AU) binaries. We use multiple simulations of star formation in giant molecular clouds and compare them to the multiplicity statistics of the Perseus star-forming region.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Methods.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Simulations were run with the adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES with sufficient resolution to resolve core fragmentation beyond 400 AU and dynamical evolution down to 16.6 AU, but without the possibility of resolving disc fragmentation. The evolution of the resulting stellar systems was followed over millions of years.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Results.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} We find that star formation in lower gas density environments is more clustered; however, despite this, the fractions of systems that form via dynamical capture and core fragmentation are broadly consistent at \~{}40\% and \~{}60\%, respectively. In all gas density environments, we find that the typical scale at which systems form via core fragmentation is 10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}3 - 3.5{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} AU. After formation, we find that systems that form via core fragmentation have slightly lower inspiral rates (\~{}10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1.68{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} AU yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} measured over the first 10 000 yr) compared to dynamical capture (\~{}10{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1.32{\textless}sup/{\textgreater} AU yr{\textless}sup{\textgreater}-1{\textless}sup/{\textgreater}). We then compared the simulation with the conditions most similar to the Perseus star-forming region to determine whether the observed bimodal distribution can be replicated. We find that it can be replicated, but it is sensitive to the evolutionary state of the simulation.{\textless}i{\textgreater}Conclusions.{\textless}i/{\textgreater} Our results indicate that a significant number of low-mass close binaries with separations from 20 - 100 AU can be produced via core fragmentation or dynamical capture due to efficient inspiral, without the need for a further contribution from disc fragmentation.},

	abstract = {We investigate the formation of protoplanetary disks around nine solar-mass stars formed in the context of a (40 pc)3 Giant Molecular Cloud model, using ramses adaptive mesh refinement simulations extending over a scale range of about 4 million, from an outer scale of 40 pc down to cell sizes of 2 au. Our most important result is that the accretion process is heterogeneous in multiple ways: in time, in space, and among protostars of otherwise similar mass. Accretion is heterogeneous in time, in the sense that accretion rates vary during the evolution, with generally decreasing profiles, whose slopes vary over a wide range, and where accretion can increase again if a protostar enters a region with increased density and low speed. Accretion is heterogeneous in space, because of the mass distribution, with mass approaching the accreting star–disk system in filaments and sheets. Finally, accretion is heterogeneous among stars, since the detailed conditions and dynamics in the neighborhood of each star can vary widely. We also investigate the sensitivity of disk formation to physical conditions and test their robustness by varying numerical parameters. We find that disk formation is robust even when choosing the least favorable sink particle parameters, and that turbulence cascading from larger scales is a decisive factor in disk formation. We also investigate the transport of angular momentum, finding that the net inward mechanical transport is compensated for mainly by an outward-directed magnetic transport, with a contribution from gravitational torques usually subordinate to the magnetic transport.}

While binarity is theorized to be an essential feature of how massive stars form6, essentially all information about such properties is derived from observations of already formed stars, whose orbital properties may have evolved since birth. Little is known about binarity during formation stages. Here we report high-angular-resolution observations of 1.3 mm continuum and H30$\alpha$ recombination line emission, which reveal a massive protobinary with apparent separation of 180 au at the centre of the massive star-forming region IRAS 07299-1651. From the line-of-sight velocity difference of 9.5 km s-1 of the two protostars, the binary is estimated to have a minimum total mass of 18 solar masses, consistent with several other metrics, and maximum period of 570 yr, assuming a circular orbit. The H30$\alpha$ line from the primary protostar shows kinematics consistent with rotation along a ring of radius of 12 au. The observations indicate that disk fragmentation at several hundred astronomical units may have formed the binary, and much smaller disks are feeding the individual protostars.},

Inside the gap, the molecular gas has a warm (100 K) component coinciding in position with a tentative free{\textendash}free emission excess observed with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. Using 1D hydrodynamic models, we find the structure of the gap is consistent with being carved by a planet with 4{\textendash}70 MJup. The coincidence of free{\textendash}free emission inside the planet-carved gap points to the planet being very young and/or still accreting. In addition, the 12CO observations reveal low-velocity large-scale filaments aligned with the disk major axis and velocity coherent with the disk gas that we interpret as ongoing gas infall from the local interstellar medium. This system appears to be an interesting case where both a star (from the environment and the disk) and a planet (from the disk) are growing in tandem.},

	abstract = {Gas-rich circumstellar disks are the cradles of planet formation. As such, their evolution will strongly influence the resulting planet population. In the ESO DESTINYS large program, we study these disks within the first 10 Myr of their development with near-infrared scattered-light imaging. Here we present VLT/SPHERE polarimetric observations of the nearby class II system SU Aur in which we resolve the disk down to scales of \~{}7 au. In addition to the new SPHERE observations, we utilize VLT/NACO, HST/STIS, and ALMA archival data. The new SPHERE data show the disk around SU Aur and extended dust structures in unprecedented detail. We resolve several dust tails connected to the Keplerian disk. By comparison with ALMA data, we show that these dust tails represent material falling onto the disk. The disk itself shows an intricate spiral structure and a shadow lane, cast by an inner, misaligned disk component. Our observations suggest that SU Aur is undergoing late infall of material, which can explain the observed disk structures. SU Aur is the clearest observational example of this mechanism at work and demonstrates that late accretion events can still occur in the class II phase, thereby significantly affecting the evolution of circumstellar disks. Constraining the frequency of such events with additional observations will help determine whether this process is responsible for the spin{\textendash}orbit misalignment in evolved exoplanet systems.},

While originally designed for handling Enzo's structure adaptive mesh refinement data, yt has been extended to work with several different simulation methods and simulation codes including Orion, RAMSES, and FLASH.

The turbulent fragmentation model successfully predicts the main features of the observed stellar IMF assuming an isothermal equation of state without any stellar feedback. As a test of the model, we focus on the case of a magnetized isothermal gas, neglecting stellar feedback, while pursuing a large dynamic range in both space and timescales covering the full spectrum of stellar masses from brown dwarfs to massive stars. Our simulations represent a generic 4 pc region within a typical Galactic molecular cloud, with a mass of 3000 M {\textless}SUB{\textgreater}?{\textless}/SUB{\textgreater} and an rms velocity 10 times the isothermal sound speed and 5 times the average Alfv{\'e}n velocity, in agreement with observations. We achieve a maximum resolution of 50 au and a maximum duration of star formation of 4.0 Myr, forming up to a thousand sink particles whose mass distribution closely matches the observed stellar IMF. A large set of medium-size simulations is used to test the sink particle algorithm, while larger simulations are used to test the numerical convergence of the IMF and the dependence of the IMF turnover on physical parameters predicted by the turbulent fragmentation model. We find a clear trend toward numerical convergence and strong support for the model predictions, including the initial time evolution of the IMF. We conclude that the physics of isothermal MHD turbulence is sufficient to explain the origin of the IMF.},

	abstract = {We carry out radiation hydrodynamic calculations to study physical processes in the formation of a 1 M ? protostar. Following our previous work, calculations pursue the whole evolution from the beginning of the first collapse to the end of the main accretion phase. The adiabatic core formed after the initial collapse (i.e., the first core) experiences further gravitational collapse triggered by dissociation of molecular hydrogen, which leads to the formation of the second core, i.e., the birth of a protostar. The protostar grows in mass as accreting the infalling material from the circumstellar envelope, while the protostar keeps its radius at 4 R ? during the main accretion phase. These typical features in the evolution are in good agreement with previous studies. We consider two different initial conditions for the density distribution: homogeneous and hydrostatic cloud cores with the same central density of 1.415 {\texttimes} 10 -19 g cm -3 . The homogeneous core has the total mass of 1 M ? while the hydrostatic core has 3.852 M ? . For the initially homogeneous model, the accretion luminosity rapidly rises to the maximum value of 25 L ? just after the birth of a protostar, and declines gradually as the mass accretion rate decreases. In contrast, the luminosity increases monotonically with time for the initially hydrostatic model. This difference arises because the mass accretion rate varies depending on the inward acceleration at the initial stage, which affects the luminosity curve. A less massive hydrostatic core would possess the similar properties in the luminosity curve to the 3.852 M ? case, because a hydrostatic cloud core with mass lower than 3.852 M ? can be shown to provide a smaller mass accretion rate after the birth of a protostar and a more gradual rise in the luminosity curve. Our numerical code is designed to provide the evolution of the spectral energy distribution (SED) along with the dynamical evolution in our spherically symmetric calculations. We confirm that the SED evolves from a 10 K graybody spectrum to hotter spectra typical for class I and flat spectrum sources. The SED for the class 0 sources corresponds to the age of 2 {\texttimes} 10 4 yr, which is smaller by an order of magnitude than the typical age of class I objects. Considering possible nonspherically symmetric effects, we suggest that observed class 0 sources should consist of the "genuine" class 0 objects, which are as young as 10 4 yr, and more evolved protostars on edge-on view ("class 0-like class I" objects). The contamination of edge-on class I objects into class 0 sources are not negligible because they are more abundant than genuine class 0 objects. Since observations indicate that the class 0 sources are typically more luminous than class I sources, the initially hydrostatic model, where the luminosity increases monotonically with time, does not match the observations. The initially homogeneous model, in contrast, shows a tendency consistent with the observations. Compiling our results and other theoretical and observational evidence, we illustrate an evolutionary picture of protostar formation. In terms of the evolutionary time and the inclination to an observer, we find that protostellar objects are clearly categorized.},

abstract = {Processing of missing data by modern neural networks, such as CNNs, remains a fundamental, yet unsolved challenge, which naturally arises in many practical applications, like image inpainting or autonomous vehicles and robots. While imputation-based techniques are still one of the most popular solutions, they frequently introduce unreliable information to the data and do not take into account the uncertainty of estimation, which may be destructive for a machine learning model. In this paper, we present MisConv, a general mechanism, for adapting various CNN architectures to process incomplete images. By modeling the distribution of missing values by the Mixture of Factor Analyzers, we cover the spectrum of possible replacements and find an analytical formula for the expected value of convolution operator applied to the incomplete image. The whole framework is realized by matrix operations, which makes MisConv extremely efficient in practice. Experiments performed on various image processing tasks demonstrate that MisConv achieves superior or comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods.},
