This chapter presents a novel approach to querying XML by keeping compressed representations of the tree structure of documents in main memory. Central to any XML query language is a path language such as XPath, which operates on the tree structure of the XML document. The chapter demonstrates that the tree structure can be effectively compressed and manipulated using techniques derived from symbolic model checking. Succinct representations of document tree structures based on sharing subtrees are highly effective. Compressed structures can be queried directly and efficiently through a process of manipulating selections of nodes and partial decompression. The chapter describes both the theoretical and experimental properties of this technique and provides algorithms for querying the compressed instances using node-selecting path query languages, such as XPath. The ability to store and manipulate large portions of the structure of very large XML documents in main memory is crucial to the development of efficient, scalable native XML databases and query engines.}

      abstract = {Grammar-based compression means to find a small grammar  that generates a given object. Such a grammar reveals the  structure of the object (according to the grammar formalism  used); the main advantage of this compression method is  that the resulting grammar can often be used in further  computations without prior decompression. A linear time  bottom-up algorithm is presented which transforms a tree  into a particular context-free tree grammar. For common XML  documents the algorithm performs well, compressing the tree  structure to about 5 per cent of the original size. The  validation of an XML document against an XML type can be  done without decompression, in linear time w.r.t. the size  of the grammar (for a fixed type). While the involved  grammars can be double exponentially smaller than the  represented trees, testing them for equivalence can be done  in polynomial space w.r.t. the sum of their sizes.},
