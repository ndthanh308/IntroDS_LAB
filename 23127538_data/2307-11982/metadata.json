  "abstract": "Let $D_λ^{d,k}$ denote the family of diagonal hypersurface over a finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$ given by \\begin{align*} D_λ^{d,k}:X_1^d+X_2^d=λdX_1^kx_2^{d-k}, \\end{align*} where $d\\geq2$, $1\\leq k\\leq d-1$, and $\\gcd(d,k)=1$. Let $\\#D^{d,k}_λ$ denote the number of points on $D_λ^{d,k}$ in $\\mathbb{P}^{1}(\\mathbb{F}_q)$. It is easy to see that $\\#D_λ^{d,k}$ is equal to the number of distinct zeros of the polynomial $y^d-dλy^k+1\\in \\mathbb{F}_q[y]$ in $\\mathbb{F}_q$. In this article, we prove that $\\#D^{d,k}_λ$ is also equal to the number of distinct zeros of the polynomial $y^{d-k}(1-y)^k-(dλ)^{-d}$ in $\\mathbb{F}_q$. We express the number of distinct zeros of the polynomial $y^{d-k}(1-y)^k-(dλ)^{-d}$ in terms of a $p$-adic hypergeometric function. Next, we derive summation identities for the $p$-adic hypergeometric functions appearing in the expressions for $\\#D^{d,k}_λ$. Finally, as an application of the summation identities, we prove identities for the trace of Frobenius endomorphism on certain families of elliptic curves.",
