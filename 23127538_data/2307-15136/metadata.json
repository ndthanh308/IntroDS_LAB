  "abstract": "We propose the Hirota bilinearization of the Fokas-Lenells derivative nonlinear Schrodinger equation with a non-vanishing background. The bilinear method is applied using an auxilary function to obtain the dark one soliton solution, dark two soliton solution and eventually the scheme for obtaining dark N soliton solutions. The use of auxilary function in bilinearization makes the method simpler than the ones reported earlier. Later, we have introduced a Lax pair for this integrable equation and using a transformation we have shown that this system is gauge equivalent to a spin system, namely the Landau-Lifshitz equation.",
