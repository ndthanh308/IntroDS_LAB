We consider winds with initial velocities ∼10 000 km s−1 and an initial momentum (energy) flux of ∼τw L/c (∼ 0.01  τw L), with . The AGN wind sweeps up and shock heats the surrounding interstellar gas, leading to a galaxy-scale outflow with velocities ∼1000 km s−1, peak mass outflow rates comparable to the star formation rate and a total ejected gas mass of ∼3 × 109 M⊙. Large momentum fluxes, τw≳ 3, are required for the AGN-driven galactic outflow to suppress star formation and accretion in the black hole’s host galaxy. Less powerful AGN winds (τw≲ 3) still produce a modest galaxy-scale outflow, but the outflow has little global effect on the ambient interstellar gas. We argue that this mechanism of AGN feedback can plausibly produce the high-velocity outflows observed in post-starburst galaxies and the massive molecular and atomic outflows observed in local ultraluminous infrared galaxies. Moreover, the outflows from local ultraluminous infrared galaxies are inferred to have τw∼ 10, comparable to what we find is required for AGN winds to regulate the growth of black holes and set the MBH - σ relation. We conclude by discussing theoretical mechanisms that can lead to AGN wind mass loading and momentum/energy fluxes large enough to have a significant impact on galaxy formation.}",

    abstract = "{We study the growth of massive black holes (BHs) in galaxies using smoothed particle hydrodynamic simulations of major galaxy mergers with new implementations of BH accretion and feedback. The effect of BH accretion on gas in its host galaxy is modelled by depositing momentum at the rate of ∼τL/c into the ambient gas, where L is the luminosity produced by accretion on to the BH and τ is the wavelength-averaged optical depth of the galactic nucleus to the AGN’s radiation (a free parameter of our model). The accretion rate on to the BH is relatively independent of our subgrid accretion model and is instead determined by the BH’s dynamical impact on its host galaxy: BH accretion is thus self-regulated rather than ‘supply limited’. We show that the final BH mass and total stellar mass formed during a merger are more robust predictions of the simulations than the time dependence of the star formation rate or BH accretion rate. In particular, the latter depend on the assumed interstellar medium physics, which determines when and where the gas fragments to form star clusters; this in turn affects the fuel available for further star formation and BH growth. Simulations over a factor of ∼30 in galaxy mass are consistent with the observed MBH–σ relation for a mean optical depth of τ∼ 25. This requires that most BH growth occur when the galactic nucleus is optically thick to far-infrared radiation, consistent with the hypothesized connection between ultraluminous infrared galaxies and quasars. We find tentative evidence for a shallower MBH–σ relation in the lowest-mass galaxies, σ≲ 100 km s−1. Our results demonstrate that feedback-regulated BH growth and consistency with the observed MBH–σ relation do not require that BH feedback terminate star formation in massive galaxies or unbind large quantities of cold gas.}",

    abstract = "{We discuss a numerical model for black hole growth and its associated feedback processes that for the first time allows cosmological simulations of structure formation to self-consistently follow the build up of the cosmic population of galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Our model assumes that seed black holes are present at early cosmic epochs at the centres of forming haloes. We then track their growth from gas accretion and mergers with other black holes in the course of cosmic time. For black holes that are active, we distinguish between two distinct modes of feedback, depending on the black hole accretion rate itself. Black holes that accrete at high rates are assumed to be in a ‘quasar regime’, where we model their feedback by thermally coupling a small fraction of their bolometric luminosity to the surrounding gas. The quasar activity requires high densities of relatively cold gas around the black hole, as it is achieved through large-scale inflows triggered by galaxy mergers. For black holes with low accretion rates, we conjecture that most of their feedback occurs in mechanical form, where AGN-driven bubbles are injected into a gaseous environment. This regime of activity, which is subdominant in terms of total black hole mass growth, can be identified with radio galaxies in clusters of galaxies, and can suppress cluster cooling flows without the requirement of a triggering by mergers. Using our new model, we carry out treesph cosmological simulations on the scales of individual galaxies to those of massive galaxy clusters, both for isolated systems and for cosmological boxes. We demonstrate that our model produces results for the black hole and stellar mass densities in broad agreement with observational constraints. We find that the black holes significantly influence the evolution of their host galaxies, changing their star formation history, their amount of cold gas and their colours. Furthermore, the properties of intracluster gas are affected strongly by the presence of massive black holes in the cores of galaxy clusters, leading to shallower metallicity and entropy profiles, and to a suppression of strong cooling flows. Our results support the notion that AGNs are a key ingredient in cosmological structure formation. They lead to a self-regulated growth of black holes and bring the simulated properties of their host galaxies into much better agreement with observations.}",

We also include the feedback from the X-ray radiation emitted by the BH, which heats the surrounding gas in the host galaxies, and adds radial momentum to the fluid. We perform simulations of isolated galaxies and merging galaxies and test various feedback models with the new treatment of the Bondi radius criterion. We find that overall the BH growth is similar to what has been obtained by earlier works using the Springel, Di Matteo, & Hernquist algorithms. However, the outflowing wind velocities and mechanical energy emitted by winds are considerably higher (v
            w ∼ 1000-3000 km s–1) compared to the standard thermal feedback model (v
            w ∼ 50-100 km s–1). While the thermal feedback model emits only 0.1% of BH released energy in winds, the momentum feedback model emits more than 30% of the total energy released by the BH in winds. In the momentum feedback model, the degree of fluctuation in both radiant and wind output is considerably larger than in standard treatments. We check that the new model of BH mass accretion agrees with analytic results for the standard Bondi problem.}

    abstract = "{We study the observational constraints on the growth of massive black holes (BHs) in galactic nuclei. We use the velocity dispersions of early-type galaxies obtained by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and the relation between BH mass and velocity dispersion to estimate the local BH mass density to be ρ•(z= 0) ≃ (2.5 ± 0.4) × 105h0.652M⊙ Mpc−3. We also use the quasi-stellar object (QSO) luminosity function from the 2dF Redshift Survey to estimate the BH mass density accreted during optically bright QSO phases. The local BH mass density is consistent with the density accreted during optically bright QSO phases if QSOs have a mass-to-energy conversion efficiency ε≃ 0.1. By studying the continuity equation for the BH mass distribution, including the effect of BH mergers, we find relations between the local BH mass function and the QSO luminosity function. If the BH mass is assumed to be conserved during BH mergers, comparison of the predicted relations with the observations suggests that luminous QSOs (Lbol≳ 1046 erg s−1) have a high efficiency (e.g. ε∼ 0.2, which is possible for thin-disc accretion on to a Kerr BH) and the growth of high-mass BHs (≳108M⊙) comes mainly from accretion during optically bright QSO phases, or that luminous QSOs have a super-Eddington luminosity. If luminous QSOs are not accreting with super-Eddington luminosities and the growth of low-mass BHs also occurs mainly during optically bright QSO phases, less luminous QSOs must accrete with a low efficiency, \\&lt;0.1; alternatively, they may accrete with high efficiency, but a significant fraction should be obscured. We estimate that the mean lifetime of luminous QSOs (Lbol≳ 1046 erg s−1) is (3–13) × 107 yr, which is comparable to the Salpeter time. We also investigate the case in which total BH mass decreases during BH mergers due to gravitational radiation; in the extreme case in which total BH entropy is conserved, the observations again suggest that BHs in most luminous QSOs are Kerr BHs accreting with an efficiency ≳0.1.}",

	abstract = {Supermassive black hole (BH) masses () are strongly correlated with galaxy stellar bulge masses (), and there are several ideas to explain the origin of this relationship. This study isolates the role of galaxy mergers from considerations of other detailed physics to more clearly show how a linear BH-galaxy mass relation (-) can naturally emerge, regardless of how primordial BHs were seeded inside galaxies, if the galaxy mass function declines with increasing mass. Under this circumstance, the - relation is a passive attractor that eventually converges to a tight linear relation because of two basic statistical effects: a central-limit-like tendency for galaxy mergers, which is much stronger for major mergers than for minor mergers, and a convergence toward a linear relation that is due mainly to minor mergers. A curious consequence of this thought experiment is that if galaxy bulges are formed by major mergers, then merger statistics naturally show that  will correlate more strongly with bulge-dominated galaxies, because of stronger central-seeking tendencies, than with disk-dominated galaxies. Even if some other physics is ultimately responsible for causing a linear - relationship, this thought experiment shows that, counter to intuition, random merging of galaxies that harbor random BH masses tends to strengthen rather than weaken a preexisting, linear, correlation. This idea may be generalized to other gravitationally bound systems (dark matter halos, compact nuclear objects) that retain their physical identities after experiencing mergers.}

    abstract = "{Black holes grow by accreting matter from their surroundings. However, angular momentum provides an efficient natural barrier to accretion and so only the lowest angular momentum material will be available to feed the black holes. The standard subgrid model for black hole accretion in galaxy formation simulations – based on the Bondi–Hoyle method – does not account for the angular momentum of accreting material, and so it is not clear how representative the black hole accretion rate estimated in this way is likely to be. In this paper we introduce a new subgrid model for black hole accretion that naturally accounts for the angular momentum of accreting material. Both the black hole and its accretion disc are modelled as a composite accretion disc particle. Gas particles are captured by the accretion disc particle if and only if their orbits bring them within its accretion radius Racc, at which point their mass is added to the accretion disc and feeds the black hole on a viscous time-scale tvisc. The resulting black hole accretion rate  powers the accretion luminosity , which drives black hole feedback. Using a series of controlled numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our new accretion disc particle method is more physically self-consistent than the Bondi–Hoyle method. We also discuss the physical implications of the accretion disc particle method for systems with a high degree of rotational support, and we argue that the MBH–σ relation in these systems should be offset from the relation for classical bulges and ellipticals, as appears to be observed.}",

    abstract = "{We present a new suite of large-volume cosmological hydrodynamical simulations called cosmo-OWLS. They form an extension to the OverWhelmingly Large Simulations (OWLS) project, and have been designed to help improve our understanding of cluster astrophysics and non-linear structure formation, which are now the limiting systematic errors when using clusters as cosmological probes. Starting from identical initial conditions in either the Planck or WMAP7 cosmologies, we systematically vary the most important ‘sub-grid’ physics, including feedback from supernovae and active galactic nuclei (AGN). We compare the properties of the simulated galaxy groups and clusters to a wide range of observational data, such as X-ray luminosity and temperature, gas mass fractions, entropy and density profiles, Sunyaev–Zel'dovich flux, I-band mass-to-light ratio, dominance of the brightest cluster galaxy and central massive black hole (BH) masses, by producing synthetic observations and mimicking observational analysis techniques. These comparisons demonstrate that some AGN feedback models can produce a realistic population of galaxy groups and clusters, broadly reproducing both the median trend and, for the first time, the scatter in physical properties over approximately two decades in mass (1013 M⊙ ≲ M500 ≲ 1015 M⊙) and 1.5 decades in radius (0.05 ≲ r/r500 ≲ 1.5). However, in other models, the AGN feedback is too violent (even though they reproduce the observed BH scaling relations), implying that calibration of the models is required. The production of realistic populations of simulated groups and clusters, as well as models that bracket the observations, opens the door to the creation of synthetic surveys for assisting the astrophysical and cosmological interpretation of cluster surveys, as well as quantifying the impact of selection effects.}",

    abstract = "{We investigate black hole–host galaxy scaling relations in cosmological simulations with a self-consistent black hole growth and feedback model. Our sub-grid accretion model captures the key scalings governing angular momentum transport by gravitational torques from galactic scales down to parsec scales, while our kinetic feedback implementation enables the injection of outflows with properties chosen to match observed nuclear outflows (star formation-driven winds are not included to isolate the effects of black hole feedback). We show that ‘quasar mode’ feedback can have a large impact on the thermal properties of the intergalactic medium and the growth of galaxies and massive black holes for kinetic feedback efficiencies as low as 0.1 per cent relative to the bolometric luminosity. None the less, our simulations indicate that the black hole–host scaling relations are only weakly dependent on the effects of black hole feedback on galactic scales, since black hole feedback suppresses the growth of galaxies and massive black holes by a similar amount. In contrast, the rate at which gravitational torques feed the central black hole relative to the host galaxy star formation rate governs the slope and normalization of the black hole–host correlations. Our results suggest that a common gas supply regulated by gravitational torques is the primary driver of the observed co-evolution of black holes and galaxies.}",

    abstract = "{The observed massive end of the galaxy stellar mass function is steeper than its predicted dark matter halo counterpart in the standard Λ cold dark matter paradigm. In this paper, we investigate the impact of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback on star formation in massive galaxies. We isolate the impact of AGN by comparing two simulations from the HORIZON suite, which are identical except that one also includes supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and related feedback models. This allows us to cross-identify individual galaxies between simulations and quantify the effect of AGN feedback on their properties, including stellar mass and gas outflows. We find that massive galaxies (M* ≥ 1011 M⊙) are quenched by AGN feedback to the extent that their stellar masses decrease by up to 80 per cent at z = 0. SMBHs affect their host halo through a combination of outflows that reduce their baryonic mass, particularly for galaxies in the mass range 109 M⊙ ≤ M* ≤ 1011 M⊙, and a disruption of central gas inflows, which limits in situ star formation. As a result, net gas inflows on to massive galaxies, M* ≥ 1011 M⊙, drop by up to 70 per cent. We measure a redshift evolution in the stellar mass ratio of twin galaxies with and without AGN feedback, with galaxies of a given stellar mass showing stronger signs of quenching earlier on. This evolution is driven by a progressive flattening of the MSMBH–M* relation with redshift, particularly for galaxies with M* ≤ 1010 M⊙. MSMBH/M* ratios decrease over time, as falling average gas densities in galaxies curb SMBH growth.}",

    abstract = "{We study the properties of black holes and their host galaxies across cosmic time in the Illustris simulation. Illustris is a large-scale cosmological hydrodynamical simulation which resolves a (106.5 Mpc)3 volume with more than 12 billion resolution elements and includes state-of-the-art physical models relevant for galaxy formation. We find that the black hole mass density for redshifts z = 0–5 and the black hole mass function at z = 0 predicted by Illustris are in very good agreement with the most recent observational constraints. We show that the bolometric and hard X-ray luminosity functions of active galactic nuclei (AGN) at z = 0 and 1 reproduce observational data very well over the full dynamic range probed. Unless the bolometric corrections are largely underestimated, this requires radiative efficiencies to be on average low, ϵr ≲ 0.1, noting however that in our model radiative efficiencies are degenerate with black hole feedback efficiencies. Cosmic downsizing of the AGN population is in broad agreement with the findings from X-ray surveys, but we predict a larger number density of faint AGN at high redshifts than currently inferred. We also study black hole–host galaxy scaling relations as a function of galaxy morphology, colour and specific star formation rate. We find that black holes and galaxies co-evolve at the massive end, but for low mass, blue and star-forming galaxies there is no tight relation with either their central black hole masses or the nuclear AGN activity.}",
