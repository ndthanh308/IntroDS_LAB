  "abstract": "We report the first ever measurements of the thermalization length of low-energy electrons injected into solid para-hydrogen at a temperature \\(T\\approx 2.8\\,\\)K. The use of the pulsed Townsend photoinjection technique has allowed us to investigate the behavior of quasi-free electrons rather than of massive, slow negative charges as reported in all previous literature. We have found an average thermalization length \\(\\langle z_0\\rangle\\approx 260\\,\\)Å which is 3 to 5 times longer than that in liquid helium at the same temperature.",
