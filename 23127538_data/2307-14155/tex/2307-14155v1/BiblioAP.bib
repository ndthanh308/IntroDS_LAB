  abstract = {The reflection anisotropy of 6328 A laser mirrors is investigated
	using an internal mirror 6328 A Heï¿½Ne laser with a fused-silica plate
	inside the cavity. Experimental and theoretical studies are made
	of: 1) the dependence of the mode polarization of the laser on the
	mirror orientation about the axis of the discharge tube; 2) the dependence
	of the mode polarization on the transverse mechanical pressure applied
	to the plate; and 3) the dependence of the beat frequency of the
	output light on the axial magnetic field applied to the plate. From
	these studies, the mirror anisotropy is obtained as 2.3ï¿½10 -3 of
	the phase type.},

	birefringence (10{\textminus}7-10{\textminus}6 rad) of supermirrors
	will lift the polarization degeneracy of TEM00 modes and generate
	two new polarization eigenstates in the cavity with small resonant
	frequency splitting (~0.1 kHz); the new eigenstates are nearly linearly
	polarized. When both modes are excited simultaneously, the intracavity
	polarization state will evolve as the energy decays in the cavity.
	Without polarization analysis, such mode beating would not be observable.
	However, real supermirrors have a linear polarization-dependent loss
	(dichroism) that leads to a change in the loss rate as the polarization
	state evolves and thus to deviation from the expected single-exponential
	decay. We develop a model for the evolution of the intracavity polarization
	state and intensity for a cavity with both birefringence and polarization-dependent
	loss in the mirrors. We demonstrate, experimentally, that these parameters
	(both magnitudes and directions) can be extracted from a series of
	measurements of the cavity decay and depolarization of the transmitted
	light.},
