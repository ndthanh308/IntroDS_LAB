@article{Minkov2023,
	abstract = {Recent discoveries of superconductivity in various hydrides at high pressures have shown that a critical temperature of superconductivity can reach near-room-temperature values. However, experimental studies are limited by high-pressure conditions, and electrical transport measurements have been the primary technique for detecting superconductivity in hydrides. Here we implement a non-conventional protocol for the magnetic measurements of superconductors in a SQUID magnetometer and probe the trapped magnetic flux in two near-room-temperature superconductors H3S and LaH10 at high pressures. Contrary to traditional magnetic susceptibility measurements, the magnetic response from the trapped flux is almost unaffected by the background signal of the diamond anvil cell due to the absence of external magnetic fields. The behaviour of the trapped flux generated under zero-field-cooled and field-cooled conditions proves the existence of superconductivity in these materials. We reveal that the absence of a pronounced Meissner effect is associated with the very strong pinning of vortices inside the samples. This approach can also be a tool for studying multiphase samples or samples that have a low superconducting fraction at ambient pressure.},

@article{Fujii2020,
	abstract = {Quantifying the dependence of thermal conductivity on grain boundary (GB) structure is critical for controlling nanoscale thermal transport in many technologically important materials. A major obstacle to determining such a relationship is the lack of a robust and physically intuitive structure descriptor capable of distinguishing between disparate GB structures. We demonstrate that a microscopic structure metric, the local distortion factor, correlates well with atomically decomposed thermal conductivities obtained from perturbed molecular dynamics for a wide variety of MgO GBs. Based on this correlation, a model for accurately predicting thermal conductivity of GBs is constructed using machine learning techniques. The model reveals that small distortions to local atomic environments are sufficient to reduce overall thermal conductivity dramatically. The method developed should enable more precise design of next-generation thermal materials as it allows GB structures exhibiting the desired thermal transport behaviour to be identified with small computational overhead.},

@article{SCHNEIDER20016,
	abstract = {A polycrystalline sample of the MgB2 superconductor was investigated by measurements of the electrical resistivity, the thermopower and the thermal conductivity in the temperature range between 1.8 and 300 K in zero magnetic field. The electrical resistivity shows a superconducting transition at Tc=38.7 K and, similarly to borocarbides, a T2.4 behaviour up to 200 K. The electron diffusion thermopower and its band-structure-derived value indicate the dominant hole character of the charge carriers. The total thermopower can be explained by the diffusion term renormalized by a significant electron--phonon interaction and a phonon drag term. In the thermal conductivity, for decreasing temperature, a significant decrease below Tc is observed resulting in a T3 behaviour below 7 K. The reduced Lorenz number exhibits values smaller than 1 and a characteristic minimum which resembles the behaviour of non-magnetic borocarbides.},

@article{Wu_2004,
	abstract = {The thermal conductivity κ(B,T)  of polycrystalline superconducting MgB2  has been studied as a function of temperature (from 4 up to 50 K) and (up to a rather large 14 T) applied magnetic field. No anomaly in the thermal conductivity κ(B,T)  is observed around the superconducting transition in the absence or presence of magnetic fields up to 14 T; at that field value the superconductivity of MgB2  persisted. The thermal conductivity in zero field shows a T-linear increase up to 50 K. The thermal conductivity is found to increase with increasing field at high fields. We interpret the findings as if there are two subsystems of quasiparticles with different field-dependent characters in a two- (L- and S-) band superconductor reacting differently with the vortex structure. The unusual enhancement of κ(B,T)  at low temperature but higher than a ( T) critical field is interpreted as a result of the overlap of the low energy states outside the vortex cores in the S band. An order of magnitude of the Bc2S  temperature dependence is given, in agreement with recent results by other authors under different experimental conditions.},

Grain sizes of in situ MgB2 bulks were systematically controlled by changing grain sizes of starting boron powder, nominal composition of Mg against B, and heating conditions. We observed a strong reciprocal relationship between grain sizes and maximum pinning forces, indicating that grain boundary is the predominant pinning centre in MgB2 bulks. C-doping to MgB2 was confirmed to enhance maximum pinning forces, especially in the samples with smaller grain sizes. This implies that C-doping strengthened the elementary pinning force at grain boundaries, rather than introducing intragrain precipitates as additional pinning centres.},

	abstract = {The discovery of superconductivity at 39{\thinspace}K in magnesium diboride1, MgB2, raises many issues, a critical one being whether this material resembles a high-temperature copper oxide superconductor or a low-temperature metallic superconductor in terms of its behaviour in strong magnetic fields. Although the copper oxides exhibit very high transition temperatures, their in-field performance2 is compromized by their large anisotropy, the result of which is to restrict high bulk current densities to a region much less than the full magnetic-field--temperature (H--T) space over which superconductivity is found. Moreover, the weak coupling across grain boundaries makes transport current densities in untextured polycrystalline samples low and strongly sensitive to magnetic field3,4. Here we report that, despite the multiphase, untextured, microscale, subdivided nature of our MgB2 samples, supercurrents flow throughout the material without exhibiting strong sensitivity to weak magnetic fields3. Our combined magnetization, magneto-optical, microscopy and X-ray investigations show that the supercurrent density is mostly determined by flux pinning, rather than by the grain boundary connectivity. Our results therefore suggest that this new superconductor class is not compromized by weak-link problems, a conclusion of significance for practical applications if higher temperature analogues of this compound can be discovered.},

@article{Nagamatsu2001,
	abstract = {In the light of the tremendous progress that has been made in raising the transition temperature of the copper oxide superconductors (for a review, see ref. 1), it is natural to wonder how high the transition temperature, Tc, can be pushed in other classes of materials. At present, the highest reported values of Tc for non-copper-oxide bulk superconductivity are 33{\thinspace}K in electron-doped CsxRbyC60 (ref. 2), and 30{\thinspace}K in Ba1-xKxBiO3 (ref. 3). (Hole-doped C60 was recently found4 to be superconducting with a Tc as high as 52{\thinspace}K, although the nature of the experiment meant that the supercurrents were confined to the surface of the C60 crystal, rather than probing the bulk.) Here we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in magnesium diboride, MgB2. Magnetization and resistivity measurements establish a transition temperature of 39{\thinspace}K, which we believe to be the highest yet determined for a non-copper-oxide bulk superconductor.},

Here, we show a huge magneto-thermal-switching ratio (MTSR) in pure Nb at temperatures lower than its superconducting transition temperature (T c = 9.2 K). The MTSR increases with decreasing temperature, and an MTSR of 650% was observed at T = 2.5 K under H = 4.0 kOe. Thermal switching in superconductors with a huge MTSR will be useful for the improvement of the performance of low-temperature electronic devices.},

@article{Hirata2023,
	abstract = {{In this study, we report a large magneto-thermal conductivity effect, potentially usable in heat flow switches and thermoelectric devices, in Ag2Te over a wide temperature range, including room temperature. When a magnetic field of μ0H = 9 T is applied to Ag2Te at 300 K along the direction perpendicular to the heat and electric currents, the thermal conductivity κ decreases by a remarkable 61\\%. This effect is mainly caused by the suppressed electronic thermal conductivity in association with a significant magnetoresistance effect, but the suppression of the thermal conductivity is larger than that of the electrical conductivity, presumably due to a field-induced decrease in the Lorenz ratio. Its very low lattice thermal conductivity, as low as 0.5 W m−1 K−1, also greatly contributes to the large relative magneto-thermal conductivity effect. The significant decrease in thermal conductivity and the 18\\% increase in the Seebeck coefficient S lead to a nearly 100\\% increase in the thermoelectric figure of merit zT = S2σTκ−1 despite the 43\\% decrease in electrical conductivity σ.}},

@article{Wehmeyer2017,
	abstract = {{ Interest in new thermal diodes, regulators, and switches has been rapidly growing because these components have the potential for rich transport phenomena that cannot be achieved using traditional thermal resistors and capacitors. Each of these thermal components has a signature functionality: Thermal diodes can rectify heat currents, thermal regulators can maintain a desired temperature, and thermal switches can actively control the heat transfer. Here, we review the fundamental physical mechanisms of switchable and nonlinear heat transfer which have been harnessed to make thermal diodes, switches, and regulators. The review focuses on experimental demonstrations, mainly near room temperature, and spans the fields of heat conduction, convection, and radiation. We emphasize the changes in thermal properties across phase transitions and thermal switching using electric and magnetic fields. After surveying fundamental mechanisms, we present various nonlinear and active thermal circuits that are based on analogies with well-known electrical circuits, and analyze potential applications in solid-state refrigeration and waste heat scavenging. }},
