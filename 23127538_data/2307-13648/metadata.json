  "abstract": "The negatively-charged silicon vacancy center ($\\rm V_{Si}^-$) in silicon carbide (SiC) is an emerging color center for quantum technology covering quantum sensing, communication, and computing. Yet, limited information currently available on the internal spin-optical dynamics of these color centers prevents us achieving the optimal operation conditions and reaching the maximum performance especially when integrated within quantum photonics. Here, we establish all the relevant intrinsic spin dynamics of negatively charged $\\rm V_{Si}^-$ center in 4H-SiC by an in-depth electronic fine structure modeling including intersystem-crossing and deshelving mechanisms. With carefully designed spin-dependent measurements, we obtain all previously unknown spin-selective radiative and non-radiative decay rates. To showcase the relevance of our work for integrated quantum photonics, we use the obtained rates to propose a realistic implementation of time-bin entangled multi-photon GHZ and cluster state generation. We find that up to 3-photon GHZ/cluster states are readily within reach using the existing nanophotonic cavity technology.",
