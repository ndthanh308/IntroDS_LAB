  "abstract": "Data centers have significant energy needs, both embodied and operational, affecting sustainability adversely. The current techniques and tools for collecting, aggregating, and reporting verifiable sustainability data are vulnerable to cyberattacks and misuse, requiring new security and privacy-preserving solutions. This paper outlines security challenges and research directions for addressing these pressing requirements.",
