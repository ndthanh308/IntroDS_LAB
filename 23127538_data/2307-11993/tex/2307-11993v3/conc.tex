\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:conc}
Security infrastructure for a sustainable system is indispensable
for protecting the environment and our planet.
The central goal of this security infrastructure
is to enable service providers to produce unforgeable proofs of
sustainability footprints for users or
regulators while preventing potential security and privacy
threats by malicious users or compromised systems.
Towards this goal, this paper discusses the threat landscapes and
new security challenges to achieve sustainability of data centers and
presents potential
 research directions to develop primitives that allow domain experts to
construct and operate sustainable data centers.
The proposed challenges and potential solutions also lay the foundations
for other sustainable systems, such as manufacturing, telecommunication systems,
and automated transportation systems.
