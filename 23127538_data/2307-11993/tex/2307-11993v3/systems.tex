\section{Sustainable Systems and Focus on Data Centers}
\label{s:systems}

There are several systems (or industries) whose unsustainable
operations pose a grave threat to the environment.
%
For example, sustainability concerns are important across a wide
industry segment such as livestock farming, automobiles, airlines,
manufacturing, energy generation, transportation, as well as
infrastructure construction and management (\eg those applicable
to buildings and roadways).
%
Data centers are particularly significant due to their substantial
energy consumption and environmental impact.
Moreover, data centers
play a vital role in supporting many industries and services that rely
on digital infrastructure, making their sustainability practices even
more critical.
%

%
Operations within data centers already contribute significantly
to the global carbon footprint~\cite{ren12}.
%, moghaddam11}.
%
The rise in popularity of resource-intensive Big Data, AI, crypto-currency, and
Machine-Learning workloads is poised to make data center operations
even more unsustainable\footnote{\href{https://datacenterfrontier.com/the-bitcoin-energy-debate-lessons-from-the-data-center-industry}{https://datacenterfrontier.com/the-bitcoin-energy-debate-lessons-from-the-data-center-industry}}.
% ~\cite{kaffes20, asyabi20, masanet20,
%   crypto-sustainability, bitcoin-sustainability}.
%
Estimates suggest
that data centers are already responsible for about 2--4\% of the total
greenhouse emissions; that is equivalent to the emissions of the
entire airline industry\footnote{\href{https://www.climateneutralgroup.com/en/news/carbon-emissions-of-data-center}{https://www.climateneutralgroup.com/en/news/carbon-emissions-of-data-center}}
%~\cite{carbon-dc}.
Worse, this figure for data
centers is soon expected to increase to 5--7\%
with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as
GPT-4 %~\cite{zeus},
%, llm-energy, ai-energy},
and applications based
on LLMs, imposing a heavier toll on the environment\footnote{\href{https://semiengineering.com/ai-power-consumption-exploding/}{https://semiengineering.com/ai-power-consumption-exploding/}}.

This paper, therefore, specifically focuses on sustainability
in data centers. Even though 
data centers' energy consumption can be significant, their efficiency 
through shared resources---the ability to integrate renewable energy and
optimize computing power---can potentially reduce the overall footprint compared to distributed on-premise solutions, such as edge servers or 
private cloud.
Also, the sheer volume of computing resources to process a wide range of data,
optimized cooling systems, and advanced energy consumption equipment
in data centers enable us to obtain a comprehensive view of the environmental
impact as opposed to their on-site alternatives. 
This could be achieved by a fine-grained approach to measuring energy consumption/carbon,
which requires security primitives, as it could become a criterion for optimization,
fine-grained diagnosis and decision making similar to financial cost in the long term.
This effort is also necessary to complete net zero and aligns with the aspirations of the
largest IT companies\footnote{\href{https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/microsoft-and-20-others-call-for-carbon-accounting-standards/}{https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/microsoft-and-20-others-call-for-carbon-accounting-standards/}}.
Moreover, such transparent monitoring and verifiable audit of energy consumption will help data centers
and service providers establish trust with customers, investors, and regulators.
%
Therefore, in this paper, we specifically focus on sustainability
in data centers.

Existing practices in data centers on reporting or advertising sustainability data are often fraught with greenwashing; as a result, the true carbon
usage of a data center is hidden. 
%~\cite{drec-initiative}.
Similar greenwashing practices have also been observed in other sectors including autonomous vehicles\footnote{\href{https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/01/16/driverless-cars-the-dark-side-of-autonomous-vehicles-that-no-ones-talking-about}{https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/01/16/driverless-cars-the-dark-side-of-autonomous-vehicles-that-no-ones-talking-about}}
%~\cite{autonomous-sustainability}
and telecommunication industries\footnote{\href{https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/01/16/driverless-cars-the-dark-side-of-autonomous-vehicles-that-no-ones-talking-about}{https://www.euronews.com/green/2023/01/16/driverless-cars-the-dark-side-of-autonomous-vehicles-that-no-ones-talking-about}}.
%~\cite{5g-impact-on-environment}.
%
Such deceptive approaches
undermine the transparency and credibility of sustainability claims,
making it difficult for stakeholders to make informed decisions.
%
The European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive
(CSRD) 
%\footnote{\href{https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/carriage/review-of-the-non-financial-reporting-directive/report?sid=6501}{https://www.europarl.europa.eu/legislative-train/carriage/review-of-the-non-financial-reporting-directive/report?sid=6501}}
%~\cite{EUsusdir}
mandates that by 2024,
corporations have to report non-financial
sustainability information precisely and clearly; this
will also apply to data center operators within the EU.
%
There is some consensus among data center operators on
reporting data center sustainability information and metrics
accurately, at least within the EU and the Asia-Pacific
region
\footnote{\href{https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/marketwatch/reading-the-runes-eu-data-center-regulations-are-coming-sooner-than-you-think/}{https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/marketwatch/reading-the-runes-eu-data-center-regulations-are-coming-sooner-than-you-think/}}.
%~\cite{EU, EUAP}.
%
In the U.S., we also see the beginnings of directives similar\footnote{\href{https://www.sustainability.gov/pdfs/federal-sustainability-plan.pdf}{https://www.sustainability.gov/pdfs/federal-sustainability-plan.pdf}} to the
EUs,
%~\cite{fedplan},
but details are still emerging.
%

\mycolor{blue}
Coarse-grained accounting may be possible using recent carbon measurement prototypes,
such as Power API\footnote{\href{https://powerapi.org/}{https://powerapi.org/}},
Kepler\footnote{\href{https://sustainable-computing.io/}{https://sustainable-computing.io/}}, and Scaphandre\footnote{\href{https://github.com/hubblo-org/scaphandre}{https://github.com/hubblo-org/scaphandre}};
however,
they are still in their infancy and are not designed to provide any support for
the verifiability of the generated carbon footprints by regulatory agencies or to
ensure the privacy of users' sustainability data.
The lack of such security and privacy guarantees,
as outlined in Section~\ref{sec:security-challenges},
can be exploited by malicious entities (\eg data center and service
providers) to bypass carbon compliance, evade taxes, induce financial loss to rival companies,
cause over/under-billing to customers, steal and exfiltrate sensitive users' data and proprietary
models, and contribute to the environmental hazards.
Hence, security measures are indispensable for independent
audits to provide an objective and verifiable assessment of data centers'
sustainability claims, preventing greenwashing and ensuring accurate reporting of carbon emissions.
Also, this transparency and accountability builds trust with
stakeholders like customers, investors, and the general
public who are increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of data centers.

\section{Data Center Architectures}
Data centers can be of different types based
on size, purpose, and the services they offer.
For instance, enterprise data centers are operated
by individual organizations to manage and store their
own data and IT infrastructure, whereas edge data centers
are smaller facilities located closer to end-users to reduce
latency and enhance the performance of
edge computing applications.
This paper, however, primarily focuses on
co-located, hyperscale, distributed or cloud data centers.
%(e.g., Google Cloud, Amazon AWS, and Microsoft Azure)
Co-located data centers (\eg Equinix, Digital Realty)
provide space, power, and cooling for servers
owned by different organizations (or \emph{tenants}),
promoting the sharing of the facility resources and physical infrastructures.
Hyperscale and cloud data centers such as Google, Amazon, and Microsoft,
deliver services like Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS),
Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS)
over the internet, and can handle massive amounts of data and traffic. 
IaaS providers 
abstract and virtualize the underlying physical IT infrastructure  
and create isolated virtual environments, thus enabling end-users and
customers to run applications, store data, and utilize physical
resources provided by data center providers. 
PaaS providers offer platforms (\eg development tools, middleware,
database and deployment services) as a service to SaaS providers to
streamline application development, deployment, and management,
facilitating faster and more efficient processes.  SaaS providers grant
users with instant access to software applications, data storage,
access control, APIs, and integration, eliminating the need for
businesses to invest in and maintain hardware and software, thereby
reducing overall IT infrastructure costs.
