  abstract =	 {Uninterrupted uptime is a critical aspect of Virtual
                  Machines (VMs) offered by cloud hosting
                  providers. Google's VMs run on top of rapidly changing
                  infrastructure: we regularly update hardware and host
                  software, and we must quickly respond to failing
                  hardware. Frequent change is critical to both development
                  velocity---deploying new versions of services and
                  infrastructure---and the ability to respond rapidly to
                  defects, including critical security fixes. Typically
                  these updates would be disruptive, resulting in VM
                  termination or restart. In this paper we present how we
                  use VM live migration at scale to eliminate this
                  disruption with minimal impact to the guest, performing
                  over 1,000,0001migrations monthly in our production fleet,
                  with 50ms median blackout, 300ms 99th percentile

  abstract =	 {Energy consumption has recently been widely recognized as
                  a major challenge of computer systems design. This paper
                  explores how to support energy as a first-class operating
                  system resource. Energy, because of its global system
                  nature, presents challenges beyond those of conventional
                  resource management. To meet these challenges we propose
                  the Currentcy Model that unifies energy accounting over
                  diverse hardware components and enables fair allocation of
                  available energy among applications. Our particular goal
                  is to extend battery lifetime by limiting the average
                  discharge rate and to share this limited resource among
                  competing task according to user preferences. To
                  demonstrate how our framework supports explicit control
                  over the battery resource we implemented ECOSystem, a
                  modified Linux, that incorporates our currentcy
                  model. Experimental results show that ECOSystem accurately
                  accounts for the energy consumed by asynchronous device
                  operation, can achieve a target battery lifetime, and
                  proportionally shares the limited energy resource among
                  competing tasks.},

                  a major challenge of computer systems design. This paper
                  explores how to support energy as a first-class operating
                  system resource. Energy, because of its global system
                  nature, presents challenges beyond those of conventional
                  resource management. To meet these challenges we propose
                  the Currentcy Model that unifies energy accounting over
                  diverse hardware components and enables fair allocation of
                  available energy among applications. Our particular goal
                  is to extend battery lifetime by limiting the average
                  discharge rate and to share this limited resource among
                  competing task according to user preferences. To
                  demonstrate how our framework supports explicit control
                  over the battery resource we implemented ECOSystem, a
                  modified Linux, that incorporates our currentcy
                  model. Experimental results show that ECOSystem accurately
                  accounts for the energy consumed by asynchronous device
                  operation, can achieve a target battery lifetime, and
                  proportionally shares the limited energy resource among

  abstract =	 {Temperature-induced reliability issues are among the major
                  challenges for multicore architectures. Thermal hot spots
                  and thermal cycles combine to degrade reliability. This
                  research presents new reliability-aware job scheduling and
                  power management approaches for chip
                  multiprocessors. Accurate evaluation of these policies
                  requires a novel simulation framework that can capture
                  architecture-level effects over tens of seconds or longer,
                  while also capturing thermal interactions among cores
                  resulting from dynamic scheduling policies. Using this
                  framework and a set of new thermal management policies,
                  this work shows that techniques that offer similar
                  performance, energy, and even peak temperature can differ
                  significantly in their effects on the expected processor
                  lifetime.},
