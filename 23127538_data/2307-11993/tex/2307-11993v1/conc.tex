\section{Conclusion}
\label{s:conc}
Security infrastructure for a sustainable system is indispensable
for protecting the environment and our planet.
The central goal of this security infrastructure
is to enable service providers to produce unforgeable proofs of
sustainability footprints for users or
regulators while preventing potential security and privacy
threats by malicious users or compromised systems.
Towards this goal, this paper discusses the threat landscapes and
new security challenges to achieve sustainability of data centers and
presents potential
 research directions to develop primitives that allow domain experts to
construct and operate sustainable data centers.
%\kanad{
The proposed challenges and potential solutions also lay the foundations
for other sustainable systems, such as manufacturing, telecommunication systems,
and automated transportation systems.
%\ag{data centers instead of systems?}

%The realization of this goal
%requires two distinct needs.
%First, users' CO2e usage must be accurately \emph{collected} by the
%system to guarantee security (\eg integrity) of both the measurement
%framework and the measurement data.
%
%Second, service providers must furnish mechanisms to produce
%unforgeable and lightweight evidence to users/regulators to ensure
%that the usage information was complete, accurate, and timely.
%
%Note that these requirements induce other security requirements such
%as the need for user identity (authentication), access controls,
%network security (\eg TLS), intrusion detection, etc.

%$  actors have incentive to cheat}
