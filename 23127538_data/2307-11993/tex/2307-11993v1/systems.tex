\section{Sustainable Systems and Focus on Data Centers}
\label{s:systems}

There are several systems (or industries) whose unsustainable
operations pose a grave threat to the environment.
%
For example, sustainability concerns are important across a wide
industry segment such as livestock farming, automobiles, airlines,
manufacturing, energy generation, transportation, as well as
infrastructure construction and management (\eg those applicable
to buildings and roadways).
%
Data centers are particularly significant due to their substantial
energy consumption and environmental impact.  Moreover, data centers
play a vital role in supporting many industries and services that rely
on digital infrastructure, making their sustainability practices even
more critical.
%
Therefore, in this article we specifically focus on sustainability
in data centers.

%
Operations within data centers already contribute significantly
to the global carbon footprint~\cite{ren12, moghaddam11}.
%
The rise in popularity of resource-intensive Big Data, AI, crypto-currency, and
Machine-Learning workloads is poised to make data center operations
even more unsustainable~\cite{kaffes20, asyabi20, masanet20,
  crypto-sustainability, bitcoin-sustainability}.
%
Estimates suggest
that data centers are already responsible for about 2--4\% of the total
greenhouse emissions; that is equivalent to the emissions of the
entire airline industry~\cite{carbon-dc}.  Worse, this figure for data
centers is soon expected to increase to 5--7\%
with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as
GPT-4~\cite{zeus, llm-energy, ai-energy}, and applications based
on LLMs, imposing a much heavier toll on the environment. 



Existing practices in data centers on reporting or advertising sustainability data are often fraught with greenwashing; as a result, the true carbon
usage of a data center is hidden~\cite{drec-initiative}. 
Similar greenwashing practices have also been observed in other sectors such as
autonomous vehicles~\cite{autonomous-sustainability} and telecommunication
industries~\cite{5g-impact-on-environment}.
%
Such deceptive approaches
undermine the transparency and credibility of sustainability claims,
making it difficult for stakeholders to make informed decisions.
%
The European Union's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive
(CSRD)~\cite{EUsusdir} mandates that by 2024,
corporations have to report non-financial
sustainability information precisely and clearly; this
will also apply to data center operators within the EU.
%
There is some consensus among data-center operators on
reporting data-center sustainability information and metrics
accurately, at least within the EU and the Asia-Pacific
region~\cite{EU, EUAP}.
%
In the U.S., we also see the beginnings of directives similar to the
EUs~\cite{fedplan}, but details are still emerging.
