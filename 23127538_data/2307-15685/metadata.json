  "abstract": "Consider a random $n\\times m$ matrix $A$ over the finite field of order $q$ where every column has precisely $k$ nonzero elements, and let $M[A]$ be the matroid represented by $A$. In the case that q=2, Cooper, Frieze and Pegden (RS\\&A 2019) proved that given a fixed binary matroid $N$, if $k\\ge k_N$ and $m/n\\ge d_N$ where $k_N$ and $d_N$ are sufficiently large constants depending on N, then a.a.s. $M[A]$ contains $N$ as a minor. We improve their result by determining the sharp threshold (of $m/n$) for the appearance of a fixed matroid $N$ as a minor of $M[A]$, for every $k\\ge 3$, and every finite field.",
