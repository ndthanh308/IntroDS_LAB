  "abstract": "Frucht showed that, for any finite group $G$, there exists a cubic graph such that its automorphism group is isomorphic to $G$. For groups generated by two elements we simplify his construction to a graph with fewer nodes. In the general case, we address an oversight in Frucht's construction. We prove the existence of cycle double covers of the resulting graphs, leading to simplicial surfaces with given automorphism group. For almost all finite non-abelian simple groups we give alternative constructions based on graphic regular representations. In the general cases $C_n,D_n,A_5$ for $n\\geq 4$, we provide alternative constructions of simplicial spheres. Furthermore, we embed these surfaces into the Euclidean 3-Space with equilateral triangles such that the automorphism group of the surface and the symmetry group of the corresponding polyhedron in $\\mathrm{O}(3)$ are isomorphic.",
