  "abstract": "The one- and two-boson momentum spectra are derived in the quantum local-equilibrium canonical ensemble of noninteracting bosons with a fixed particle number constraint. We define the canonical ensemble as a subensemble of events associated with the grand-canonical ensemble. Applying simple hydro-inspired parametrization with parameter values that correspond roughly to the values at the system's breakup in $p+p$ collisions at the LHC energies, we compare our findings with the treatment which is based on the grand-canonical ensembles where mean particle numbers coincide with fixed particle numbers in the canonical ensembles. We observe a significantly greater sensitivity of the two-particle momentum correlation functions to fixed multiplicity constraint compared to one-particle momentum spectra. The results of our analysis may be useful for interpretation of multiplicity-dependent measurements of $p+p$ collision events.",
