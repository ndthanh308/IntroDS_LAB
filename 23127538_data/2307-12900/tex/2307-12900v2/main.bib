              problems in computer vision, seeks to locate object instances
              from a large number of predefined categories in natural images.
              Deep learning techniques have emerged as a powerful strategy for
              learning feature representations directly from data and have led
              to remarkable breakthroughs in the field of generic object
              detection. Given this period of rapid evolution, the goal of this
              paper is to provide a comprehensive survey of the recent
              achievements in this field brought about by deep learning
              techniques. More than 300 research contributions are included in
              this survey, covering many aspects of generic object detection:
              detection frameworks, object feature representation, object
              proposal generation, context modeling, training strategies, and
              evaluation metrics. We finish the survey by identifying promising

    abstract = { Most current Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models are based on highly simplified brain dynamics. They have been used as powerful computational tools to solve complex pattern recognition, function estimation, and classification problems. ANNs have been evolving towards more powerful and more biologically realistic models. In the past decade, Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have been developed which comprise of spiking neurons. Information transfer in these neurons mimics the information transfer in biological neurons, i.e., via the precise timing of spikes or a sequence of spikes. To facilitate learning in such networks, new learning algorithms based on varying degrees of biological plausibility have also been developed recently. Addition of the temporal dimension for information encoding in SNNs yields new insight into the dynamics of the human brain and could result in compact representations of large neural networks. As such, SNNs have great potential for solving complicated time-dependent pattern recognition problems because of their inherent dynamic representation. This article presents a state-of-the-art review of the development of spiking neurons and SNNs, and provides insight into their evolution as the third generation neural networks. }

abstract = {The computational power of formal models for networks of spiking neurons is compared with that of other neural network models based on McCulloch Pitts neurons (i.e., threshold gates), respectively, sigmoidal gates. In particular it is shown that networks of spiking neurons are, with regard to the number of neurons that are needed, computationally more powerful than these other neural network models. A concrete biologically relevant function is exhibited which can be computed by a single spiking neuron (for biologically reasonable values of its parameters), but which requires hundreds of hidden units on a sigmoidal neural net. On the other hand, it is known that any function that can be computed by a small sigmoidal neural net can also be computed by a small network of spiking neurons. This article does not assume prior knowledge about spiking neurons, and it contains an extensive list of references to the currently available literature on computations in networks of spiking neurons and relevant results from neurobiology.}
