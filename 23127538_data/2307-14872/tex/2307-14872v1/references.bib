@book{MU17,
author = {Mitzenmacher, Michael and Upfal, Eli},
title = {Probability and Computing: Randomization and Probabilistic Techniques in Algorithms and Data Analysis},
year = {2017},
isbn = {110715488X},
publisher = {Cambridge University Press},
address = {USA},
edition = {2nd},
abstract = {Greatly expanded, this new edition requires only an elementary background in discrete mathematics and offers a comprehensive introduction to the role of randomization and probabilistic techniques in modern computer science. Newly added chapters and sections cover topics including normal distributions, sample complexity, VC dimension, Rademacher complexity, power laws and related distributions, cuckoo hashing, and the Lovasz Local Lemma. Material relevant to machine learning and big data analysis enables students to learn modern techniques and applications. Among the many new exercises and examples are programming-related exercises that provide students with excellent training in solving relevant problems. This book provides an indispensable teaching tool to accompany a one- or two-semester course for advanced undergraduate students in computer science and applied mathematics.}

  abstract = 	 { We consider the problem of estimating the partition function $Z(\beta)=\sum_x \exp(-\beta H(x))$ of a Gibbs distribution with a Hamilton $H(\cdot)$, or more precisely the logarithm of the ratio $q=\ln Z(0)/Z(\beta)$. It has been recently shown how to approximate $q$ with high probability assuming the existence of an oracle that produces samples from the Gibbs distribution for a given parameter value in $[0,\beta]$. The current best known approach due to Huber (2015) uses $O(q\ln n\cdot[\ln q + \ln \ln n+\varepsilon^{-2}])$  oracle calls on average where $\varepsilon$ is the desired accuracy of approximation and $H(\cdot)$ is assumed to lie in $\{0\}\cup[1,n]$. We improve the complexity to $O(q\ln n\cdot\varepsilon^{-2})$ oracle calls. We also show that the same complexity can be achieved if exact oracles are replaced with approximate sampling oracles that are within $O(\frac{\varepsilon^2}{q\ln n})$ variation distance from exact oracles. Finally, we prove a lower bound of $\Omega(q\cdot \varepsilon^{-2})$ oracle calls under a natural model of computation. }

abstract = {Abstract In this article we propose new methods for computing the asymptotic value for the logarithm of the partition function (free energy) for certain statistical physics models on certain type of finite graphs, as the size of the underlying graph goes to infinity. The two models considered are the hard-core (independent set) model when the activity parameter λ is small, and also the Potts (q-coloring) model. We only consider the graphs with large girth. In particular, we prove that asymptotically the logarithm of the number of independent sets of any r-regular graph with large girth when rescaled is approximately constant if r ≤ 5. For example, we show that every 4-regular n-node graph with large girth has approximately (1.494…)n-many independent sets, for large n. Further, we prove that for every r-regular graph with r ≥ 2, with n nodes and large girth, the number of proper q ≥ r + 1 colorings is approximately \${[q{(1 - {1 \over q})}^{r \over 2} ]^n}\$ n, for large n. We also show that these results hold for random regular graphs with high probability (w.h.p.) as well. As a byproduct of our method we obtain simple algorithms for the problem of computing approximately the logarithm of the number of independent sets and proper colorings, in low degree graphs with large girth. These algorithms are deterministic and use certain correlation decay properties for the corresponding Gibbs measures, and its implications to uniqueness of the Gibbs measures on the infinite trees, as well as some simple cavity trick which is well known in the physics and the Markov chain sampling literature.© 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

We generalize a framework, developed in our recent paper [18] in the context of the Ising model, for establishing mixing time O(n log n), which ties this property closely to phase transitions in the underlying model. We use this framework to obtain rapid mixing results for several models over a significantly wider range of parameter values than previously known, including situations in which the mixing time is strongly dependent on the boundary condition.},
