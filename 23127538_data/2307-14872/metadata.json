  "abstract": "We present polynomial-time algorithms for approximate counting and sampling solutions to constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) with atomic constraints within the local lemma regime: $$ pD^{2+o_q(1)}\\lesssim 1. $$ When the domain size $q$ of each variable becomes sufficiently large, this almost matches the known lower bound $pD^2\\gtrsim 1$ for approximate counting and sampling solutions to atomic CSPs [Bezáková et al, SICOMP '19; Galanis, Guo, Wang, TOCT '22], thus establishing an almost tight sampling Lovász local lemma for large domain sizes.",
