  "abstract": "The interaction energy between two atoms is crucially dependent on the quantum state of the two-atom system. In this paper, it is demonstrated that a steady resonance interaction energy between two atoms exists when the atoms are in a certain type of coherent superposition of single-excitation states. The interaction is tree-level classical in the sense of the Feynman diagrams. A quantity called quantum classicality is defined in the present paper, whose nonzero-ness ensures the existence of this interaction. The dependence of the interatomic interaction on the quantum nature of the state of the two-atom system may potentially be tested with Rydberg atoms.",
