  "abstract": "Recent advances in the simulation of frictionally contacting elastodynamics with the Incremental Potential Contact (IPC) model have enabled inversion and intersection-free simulation via the application of mollified barriers, filtered line-search, and optimization-based solvers for time integration. In its current formulation the IPC model is constructed via a discrete constraint model, replacing non-interpenetration constraints with barrier potentials on an already spatially discretized domain. However, while effective, this purely discrete formulation prohibits convergence under refinement. To enable a convergent IPC model we reformulate IPC potentials in the continuous setting and provide a first, convergent discretization thereof. We demonstrate and analyze the convergence behavior of this new model and discretization on a range of elastostatic and dynamic contact problems, and evaluate its accuracy on both analytical benchmarks and application-driven examples.",
