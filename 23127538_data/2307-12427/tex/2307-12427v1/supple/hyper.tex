\subsection{Effect of Hyperparameters}
% Figure environment removed
We conducted additional experiments under the VOC 10-10 setting to analyze the impact of all hyperparameters in our study, as depicted in~\cref{fig:sm-hyp}. 
For $\gamma$ in Eq. \textcolor{red}{5} of the overall ARD loss function, we vary it in range [0.5, 1.0, 5.0]. From the results shown in the first figure of~\cref{fig:sm-hyp}, we find that the default $\gamma=1$ provides good results. 

In consequence, we optimize the total objective function to realize incremental object detecion learning:
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{L}_{total} = \mathcal{L}_{faster\_rcnn} + \alpha\mathcal{L}_{ID}+\beta\mathcal{L}_{ARD}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ and $\beta$ weight for the Inclusive Distillation Loss and Attentive RoI Distillation, respectively. We vary it in range [0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1].
The performance varies as a function of $\alpha, \beta$ outperforming the state-of-the-art (66.8) for most combinations.
