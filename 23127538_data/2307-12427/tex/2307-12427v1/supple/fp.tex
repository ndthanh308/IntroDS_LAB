\section{Additional Analysis}
\subsection{Analysis foreground shift problem}

In Table \textcolor{red}{1} and Table \textcolor{red}{2}, our algorithm demonstrates a remarkable improvement in mean Average Precision (mAP) ranging from 0.2$\sim$20\% across all categories. Additionally, it exhibits a substantial mAP boost of 4.5\% to 25.2\% in new categories (foreground categories), indicating the enhanced stability and plasticity achieved by our method.

Moreover, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of False Positives (FP)\cite{hoiem2012diagnosing} under the VOC 10-10 setting. \cref{fig:sm-fp_bg} visually represents the number of background errors, specifically detections confused with the background or unlabeled objects. Notably, our approach (ABR) demonstrates a clear advantage, exhibiting a substantial reduction of 275 errors in new (foreground) classes compared to the ImageReplay method. This compelling result strongly suggests the successful mitigation of the foreground shift problem by our proposed approach.
