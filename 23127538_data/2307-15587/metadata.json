  "abstract": "In this paper we study the Penrose limit of the T-dual of the MNa solution and its field theory dual, in order to better understand the effect of T-duality in this case. We find a matching of string pp wave oscillators and their masses to the field theory modes, that are rearranged after T-duality. The effect of T-duality on the long \"annulon-type\" operators is found, as a symmetry of the 2+1 dimensional confining theory with spontaneous susy breaking.",
