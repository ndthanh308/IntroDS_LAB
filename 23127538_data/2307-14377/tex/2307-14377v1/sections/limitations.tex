\section{Limitations}

Describe limitation of each of the components of the workflow

\paragraph{Text-To-Design}
What are the limits on design primitives?
What are the limits of constraints?
What are the limits on modularity/hierarchical design?

Evaluate validity of the design.
Evaluate correctness.

\paragraph{Text-To-Design-Space}
Limits of parametric design.
Limits of interpolation/extrapolation.
Limits of grammars.

\paragraph{Design-To-Manufacturing}
Limits of validity of the translation.
Limits of correctness.
Limits on the length of the output. Complexity of the output.
Limits on custom manufacturing processes.

\paragraph{Design-To-Performance}
Which performance metrics are understandable?
Which performance metrics need external simulation?

\paragraph{Performance-and-Design-Space To Design}
Which objective function are understandable?
What are the limits on specifying constraints?
What are the limits of the search process for the inverse?
