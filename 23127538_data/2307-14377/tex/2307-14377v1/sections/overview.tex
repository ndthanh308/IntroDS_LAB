The fundamental aim of this study is to conduct an in-depth exploration of the opportunities and challenges of applying contemporary \llms  within the landscape of the \cdam workflow described in \sref{sec:related_cdam}. 
Driven by this objective, we propose a thorough and wide-ranging exploration that is independent of any predefined or proposed framework.

To apply \llms coherently across such diverse tasks, we leverage the insight that all building blocks in the \cdam workflow (design, design spaces, manufacturing instructions, and performance metrics) can be represented by compact programs.
Thus, at a high level, every phase of the \cdam workflow can be seen as a translation layer between an input DSL and an output DSL. 
The fact that \llms excel at such symbolic manipulations suggests that \llms have the potential to address these tasks while simultaneously leveraging and improving upon our traditional solutions.

To achieve comprehensive coverage and uncover the different facets of \llm-assisted \cdam, we have undertaken an extensive suite of experiments, incorporating a broad variety of design representations, manufacturing processes, and performance metrics. These are detailed further in \sref{sec:domains}.

    \caption{\textbf{\gpt's key properties for \cdam} To facilitate discussion of \gpt's applicability for design and manufacturing (Des.\&Mfg.), we have identified 9 key observations about \gpt that persist across several aspects of the \cdam workflow. This includes 3 powerful capabilities, 4 limitations, and 2 dualisms (so named because they may manifest either as an opportunity or a drawback, depending on the context). We use these observations to frame our discussions about \gpt's suitability for each stage of the \cdam workflow.}

Our methodology is crafted to provide a comprehensive inspection of the opportunities for and efficacy of various interfaces between \gpt and the \cdam workflow. 
We investigate each of the five stages of the design and manufacturing pipeline individually.
As illustrated in \fref{fig:llm_graph}, these stages include: 
design generation (\sref{sec:text_to_design}), 
design space generation (\sref{sec:text_to_design_space}), 
design for manufacturing (\sref{sec:design_for_manufacturing}), 
performance prediction (\sref{sec:design_to_perf}), 
and inverse design (\sref{sec:inverse}).

In each of these stages, we pose fundamental questions about ways in which \gpt may offer some benefit, and then conduct a series of experiments to answer these questions.
For each query, we investigate aspects such as 
(1) strategies for engineering effective prompts,
(2) strategies for integrating human feedback, expertise, or preferences into the \llm-assisted design process, and
(3) tasks that \gpt can accomplish natively versus tasks that are better completed by asking \gpt to leverage external tools.

After a detailed examination of each stage, we sought to understand the implications of incorporating \gpt within an end-to-end \cdam process. 
To this end, we designed and fabricated two practical examples (a cabinet and a quadcopter) with \gpt's support.
The end-to-end design process for each example is detailed in \sref{sec:examples}.

Beyond these individual questions, our comprehensive investigation has also exposed several key insights about \gpt's general capabilities and limitations with respect to \cdam. 
We have also observed a group of properties that we term 'dualisms', because they may manifest either as an opportunity or a drawback, depending on the situation. 
Our findings are summarized in \tref{tab:key_properties}, with a full description in \sref{sec:capabilities}. 
To emphasize the pervasive nature of these properties, we also use these labels as a framework for our discussions and takeaways at the end of each section. 
Specifically, we draw on each section's findings and examples in order to illustrate the manifestation and impact of various properties in \tref{tab:key_properties} throughout the \cdam workflow.

%\paragraph{Roadmap}



% Rather than proposing and evaluating a specific framework, our hope is that the dissemination of our findings to the broader community will stimulate fresh insights and contribute to the development of innovative frameworks. We firmly believe that if these new frameworks are founded on robust empirical data, as provided by this study, it will lead to a more effective integration of LLMs across a variety of tasks within the realm of design and fabrication.



% Each of the upcoming sections will explore different ways to incorporate {\llm}s into any given arrow within the \llmgraph described in \sref{sec:llm_graph}.
% Our early sections explore a variety of domains and examples, while successive
% sections hone in on a narrower subset of the examples that best allow us to deeply explore a given line of inquiry.
% To illustrate the full \llm-augmented \cdam pipeline, we also have two extended examples that are considered in every section: 
% a carpentry example (cabinet), and a simple robotics example (quadcopter).

% \subsection{Key Takeaways}

% In our analaysis of \gpt's abilities in desing and fabrication we have extracted a few key capabiltiies that have been good at supporting design as well as a few key limiations. In what follows we wll list those and summarize how they manifest and differnt methods we have used or considered for addressing the limiations. We will concreize them in the each of the sections alter and we will refer to these points when we do. 

% Capabilities:
% C. 1) Extensive Knowledge Base and Capabilities in Design and Fabrication domain, being able to solve for a bunch of things and auto-complete specifications. Different examples in differente domains
% - Degins: 

% c.2) Allows for iteration - if you point a mistake it will try to correct it, wont always work  but this is a good thing.

% c.3) Allows for modality - if you work with it to create something adn they ask to reuse it (as long as you give it bad cause it can forget) it will do it.


% Limiatations
% L1) Reasoning Challenges 
% It is bad at certain types of reasoning, particularly ones that require compuations. This reveals itself as chalelnges with spacial reasoning.

% Potential solutions: There are two key solutions to this problem. One is novel Domain specific languages (DSLs). DSLs are essecially a way to  encapsulate knowledge—they capture recurring invariances, rules, and abstractions that have repeatedly proven beneficial. By using the right DSLs we can bypass the knowlege gap.Second if using APIs that can do the resoning that it's bad at. GPT is good at high-level abstractions and we can export those and then plug them in to solvers that can compute the final answer from these abstractions.  

% L2) Correctness and Verification
% it will often get things wrong and it can't verify itse'f

% Potential Solutions: In additoinal to having a human verififier, we can automate verification by using APIs that can run checks an validations. For Fixing issues, we can leverage (C2) to then feed this information back in and loop until a propor solutoins is given. 


% L3) Scalability
% it struggles as problems get larger or more complex. This reveals itself with challenges of doing multiple thigns at the same time.  

% Potential Solutions: Solutuions are to ask it for one thig at the time (e.g. in evaluating peformance instead of asking for all the metrics we want we can ask one at a time and this helps). When we want to build more complex models  the idea of incremntality is also helpful, but here we need to compose them in the end. We can lever use c3 to enable constructing more complex models from a sequence of instructions.
