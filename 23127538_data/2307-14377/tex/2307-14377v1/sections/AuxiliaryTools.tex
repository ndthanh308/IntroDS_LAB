\section{Auxiliary Tools}


This is a section for describing how to enforce:

\paragraph{Visualization Tools}
Describe standard tools for:
SVG (e.g., inkscape, Gimp, Adobe Illustrator)
STL: Meshlab, or any CAD sofware
gcode: repetier, cura, IceSL
CAD formats: OpenJscad, Autodesk Fusion 360
Knitting: KnitOut?
Graph visualization tool - e.g., graph converter tool from Allan, Graphviz, Networkx

\paragraph{Output Verification Correctness Checking}

We want to make sure that the output is correct.
We need to have virtual tools to make sure that the output is valid and correct.

Tools to make sure that the output is valid:

Tools that ensure that the output is correct, can be done by human visual inspection. They can be also done by an automated tools that runs the visualizer or simulator. Show an example of such a tool and simulator.

\paragraph{Post-process Fixing Tools}

Results might not be correct. Describe tools to post-process the output. For example, making sure that things are connected. Non-overlapping. Write a simple post-processing script that fixes the incorrect results.


\paragraph{Using Solvers in an Interactive Loop}
Generate design (geometry) and boundary conditions, materials
We run FEA solver, (we report what max stress is)
LLM can draw additional conclusions from these results.


Constraint solvers (CSP) - TODO
Logical solvers - Coq
Numerical Solvers - Optimizers such as SNOPT, NLOpt, or linear algebra packages like Eigen.

\paragraph{Program Synthesizers}
Sketch, etc.

\paragraph{Simulators}
Static simulators - SimScale, tools built into CAD software
Dynamic simulators - Chrono, Mujoco, Bullet, etc.

\paragraph{Surrogate/learned models}
CLEVERER and intuitive physics types models
etc.
