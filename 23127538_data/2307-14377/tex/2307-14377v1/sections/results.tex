\section{End-to-End Design Examples}
\label{sec:examples}

% \wojciech{Add a short intro.} 

In the preceding sections, we have explored how \gpt can benefit different stages of the design and manufacturing processes. 
Now, we consider the comprehensive end-to-end design processes for two examples that have been consistently referenced throughout this manuscript: the cabinet and the quadcopter. 
From initial design and evaluation to manufacturing and testing, we showcase how \gpt seamlessly integrates with each stage. For the cabinet, \gpt automates 3D design, part sourcing, manufacturing instructions, assembly guidance, and performance evaluations. Similarly, for the quadcopter, \gpt facilitates design, part selection, manufacturing, assembly, and testing. These examples highlight the capabilities of \gpt in streamlining the product development process with minimal human intervention.

\subsection{Cabinet}
\label{sec:cabinet}


In this subsection, we consolidate and elaborate on the comprehensive \llm-assisted development process for a wood cabinet with minimal human intervention. Throughout this process, \gpt played major roles in generating the 3D design, facilitating part sourcing based on the design specifications, generating machine-readable manufacturing instructions, providing human-readable assembly guidance, and conducting final performance evaluations (Figure \ref{fig:cabinet_summary}). This holistic approach highlights the extensive capabilities of \gpt in automating and optimizing various stages of this product development process.
% This process encompasses text-to-design, design-to-performance, design-to-manufacturing, and a real-world example. \wojciech{Add a figure on how the complete workflow looks like. Short discussion.}

\subsubsection{Design}
We employed \gpt to generate Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models using such as \jscad (Section \ref{sec:textToDesign_JSCAD_basic}). After a few iterations, \gpt successfully generated accurate CAD design files (see Section \ref{sec:text_to_design} for more details). 
%\liane{the following text seems a bit peripheral to the design of the eventually-fabricated cabinet. Maybe something more like "Although we used \gpt to explore variations (like a door/handle, extra shelves), we ultimately decided to fabricate a version with x specifications: height, width, \# shelves, brackets, etc." Not sure if this description should be here or later on (depends when you choose the final design, whether perf metrics play a role,etc.). But at some point, we should know what the specs were :) } 
Additionally, we demonstrated utilizing \gpt to modify the cabinet design, including tasks such as adding a door and a handle (Section \ref{sec:textTODesign_spatial_constraints}) or adjusting the number of shelves (Section \ref{sec:textTODesign_abstractions}). \gpt even integrated prefabricated elements like brackets into the cabinet design (Section \ref{sec:prefabbed-ele}). We ultimately decided to fabricate the version of the cabinet presented in \fref{fig:textToDesign_simpleCabinet} with one shelf supported by four brackets.

\subsubsection{Manufacturing}
We then tested \gpt's capabilities in tackling real-world manufacturing challenges encountered during the fabrication of the cabinet. These challenges encompass various aspects of the general manufacturing process, such as part sourcing, generating machine-readable instructions, addressing material and fabrication constraints, facilitating design modifications, providing assembly guidance, and offering human-readable instructions.

For this particular example, our manufacturing plan involved utilizing a universal laser system to cut commercially available wood boards. First, by leveraging the detailed design specifications in \jscad, \gpt provided accurate suggestions for sourcing specific items, including brackets from Home Depot and wood pieces from McMaster. Each suggestion was accompanied by a concise description of the item (\fref{fig:cabinet3} and Section \ref{sec:part_sourcing}).
Furthermore, in order to realize the subtractive manufacturing approach, \gpt successfully generated precise 2D DXF files for laser cutting the wood pieces. These files were derived from the original 3D \jscad model, effectively guiding the laser cutter in executing the required cutting patterns (Section \ref{sec:designForManufacturing_Subtractive}). 

We also showcased \gpt's ability to adapt the design based on fabrication constraints. For example, the largest wood pieces we were able to obtain from McMaster that could fit into our laser cutter were 12 by 24 inches. Unfortunately, this size was too small to support the original cabinet design. As we presented this constraint to \gpt, it successfully scaled down the entire design to ensure compatibility with the available wood pieces (\fref{fig:cabinet4}). Given that our laser cutter is capable of engraving patterns onto the cutting materials, we took advantage of this feature and requested \gpt to generate Python code for producing DXF files that could engrave words onto the side board of the cabinet. \gpt was able to fulfill this request, providing us with the necessary code to create the desired engraving.

Finally, once we had the laser-cut wood pieces, we proceeded to assemble them into a fully functional cabinet. During this process, we sought \gpt's expertise in recommending the most suitable adhesive for wood. \gpt suggested Quick-Set Epoxy, 3M DP100, 1.64 FL. oz. Cartridge as the optimal glue for our purposes (\fref{fig:cabinet6}). Additionally, \gpt provided detailed treatment guidance and step-by-step procedures for the assembly, ensuring a smooth and successful construction process (\fref{fig:cabinet6}). 
The final fabricated cabinet is showcased in Figure \ref{fig:cabinet7}, offering three different view angles. To provide a clear perspective of its size, a mug is placed on the middle shelf, serving as a reference for scale.

\subsubsection{Performance evaluation}
Using the 3D \jscad design as a basis, \gpt was prompted to develop functions to evaluate performance criteria: storage capacity, load capacity before sagging substantially, plywood material cost, and accessibility for individuals in wheelchairs. See Section~\ref{designToPerformance_Objective} for details on this type of design evaluation for numerical evaluation and Section~\ref{designToPerformance_Subjective} for subjective metrics. When comparing these values for the original and scaled cabinets, the storage capacity, load capacity before sagging, material cost, and accessibility were computed to be 9,205 $\mathrm{in}^3$, \$67, 14.336 lbs, and a score of 5/10 for the original cabinet, and 1,131 $\mathrm{in}^3$, \$18, 8.601 lbs, and a score of 5/10 for the scaled-down cabinet. It failed to compute an appropriate strength and could not verify the equation, but other evaluations are correct. Based on these numbers, both cabinets were qualitatively classified as "strong" on a range of "strong," "moderate," or "weak," being far stronger than a typical cabinet used in an office. However, while the larger cabinet was categorized as "highly useful" on a scale of "useful," "moderate", or "not useful" due to its high strength and storage capacity, the smaller cabinet was only "moderately useful" due to its small size. Further aesthetic evaluation in text form is included in Figure~\ref{fig:cabinet_aesthetics}, classifying without computation the original design as "Contemporary" and the scaled design as "Minimalist".

% Storage capacity was calculated as the total enclosed volume of the cabinet, excluding shelves, as expected. For assessing load capacity, \gpt employed the "sagulator" formula, a commonly used estimation technique in carpentry. To address accessibility, \gpt estimated height and depth ranges that would be beneficial, assigning a higher score for shorter and deeper cabinets.
% \liane{did we actually use any of these results to further the process of our end-to-end example? these seem like digressions atm rather than something driving a process forward. not saying we shouldn't include them, it just seems like we should write a bit more to answer the question "so what/why did I read this?" maybe talk about what the performance is of the cabinet we chose?}\bolei{there is no relation between the fabricated sample and the evaluated performance. We did not choose the design based on its performance. }\liane{I'd be inclined to leave it out of this end-to-end section then, personally, since it doesn't tie into the story. maybe bring it up at the meeting and get others' thoughts?}
