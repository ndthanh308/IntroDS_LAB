  "abstract": "A new algorithm for regret minimization in online convex optimization is described. The regret of the algorithm after $T$ time periods is $O(\\sqrt{T \\log T})$ - which is the minimum possible up to a logarithmic term. In addition, the new algorithm is adaptive, in the sense that the regret bounds hold not only for the time periods $1,\\ldots,T$ but also for every sub-interval $s,s+1,\\ldots,t$. The running time of the algorithm matches that of newly introduced interior point algorithms for regret minimization: in $n$-dimensional space, during each iteration the new algorithm essentially solves a system of linear equations of order $n$, rather than solving some constrained convex optimization problem in $n$ dimensions and possibly many constraints.",
