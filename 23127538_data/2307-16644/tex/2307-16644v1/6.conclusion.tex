\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec::conclusion}
In this work, we approach the new problem of living needs prediction, which is critical in life services platforms.
We present the NEON system in Meituan, consisting of three phases, feature mining, feature fusion, and multitask prediction. 
Large-scale online A/B testing in three downstream applications, along with extensive offline evaluation, strongly confirm the effectiveness of our system.
As for future work, we plan to test NEON's performance in more downstream applications.
