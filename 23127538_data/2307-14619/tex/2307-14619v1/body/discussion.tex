\section{Discussion}

This work considerably loosened assumptions placed on the \emph{expert distribution}; nevertheless, to facilitate our analysis we require the \emph{dynamics} to be sufficiently smooth and regular.  While such assumptions hold for a range of high-level tasks, a major remaining open question is what happens when discontinuities (or even non-smoothness) are allowed in the dynamics; these arise for example, when considering contact dynamics for applications in robotics.  In addition, while our theory allows for time-varying policies, in many robotics applications, time-invariant policies are more natural; understanding what changes in this regime also remains open.  Despite these limitations, our work presents a significant step toward understanding the imitation of complex trajectories in natural control systems.
