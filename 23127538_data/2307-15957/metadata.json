  "abstract": "The Monge-Ampère type equations over bounded convex domains arise in a host of geometric applications. In this paper, we focus on the Dirichlet problem for a class of Monge-Ampère type equations, which can be degenerate or singular near the boundary of convex domains. Viscosity subsolutions and viscosity supersolutions to the problem can be constructed via comparison principle. Finally, we demonstrate the existence, uniqueness and interior regularity (including $W^{2,p}$ with $p\\in(1,+\\infty)$, $C^{1,μ}$ with $μ\\in(0,1)$, and $C^\\infty$) of the viscosity solution to the problem.",
