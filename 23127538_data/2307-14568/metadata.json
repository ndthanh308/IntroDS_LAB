  "abstract": "While reinforcement learning algorithms have had great success in the field of autonomous navigation, they cannot be straightforwardly applied to the real autonomous systems without considering the safety constraints. The later are crucial to avoid unsafe behaviors of the autonomous vehicle on the road. To highlight the importance of these constraints, in this study, we compare two learnable navigation policies: safe and unsafe. The safe policy takes the constraints into account, while the other does not. We show that the safe policy is able to generate trajectories with more clearance (distance to the obstacles) and makes less collisions while training without sacrificing the overall performance.",
