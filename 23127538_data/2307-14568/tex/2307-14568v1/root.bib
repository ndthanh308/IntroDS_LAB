@inproceedings{SAC,
abstract = {Model-free deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have been demonstrated on a range of challenging decision making and control tasks. However, these methods typically suffer from two major challenges: very high sample complexity and brittle convergence properties, which necessitate meticulous hyperparameter tuning. Both of these challenges severely limit the applicability of such methods to complex, real-world domains. In this paper, we propose soft actor-critic, an off-policy actor-critic deep RL algorithm based on the maximum entropy reinforcement learning framework. In this framework, the actor aims to maximize expected reward while also maximizing entropy - that is, succeed at the task while acting as randomly as possible. Prior deep RL methods based on this framework have been formulated as Q-learning methods. By combining off-policy updates with a stable stochastic actor-critic formulation, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on a range of continuous control benchmark tasks, outperforming prior on-policy and off-policy methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in contrast to other off-policy algorithms, our approach is very stable, achieving very similar performance across different random seeds.},

In particular, for continuous control, our method outperforms existing methods with respect to sample efficiency, premature convergence and robustness to hyperparameter settings.},

abstract = {Local planner makes a trajectory physically executable for an agent. Open Space Planner of Apollo framework based on nonlinear optimization methods smooths the trajectory received from a global planner. Such dependency on a global planner forces an agent to relaunch both planners when local changes occur (e.g., when an environment has dynamic obstacles), what can waste too much time. In this article, we consider a different approach which is based on reinforcement learning. This method allows agent generate a trajectory using information about environment (the current and goal state, lidar sensors, etc.). Experiments conducted on the simplified environment show that such algorithm can be implemented as the local planner in Apollo infrastructure.},

abstract = {This paper addresses the autonomous parking for a vehicle in environments with static and dynamic obstacles. Although parking maneuvering has reached the level of fully automated valet parking, there are still many challenges to realize the parking motion planning in the presence of dynamic obstacles. One of the most famous autonomous driving platforms is the Baidu Apollo platform. In the Apollo platform, this problem is solved using the classic method hybrid A*. However, this method has two main downsides. Firstly, it generates in some parking scenarios, trajectories that consist of many partitions with different gear types and sizes. Such trajectories are intractable by a self-driving car when testing the Apollo planner on more realistic data coming from a simulator such as SVL. Secondly, the built-in algorithm does not have the ability to interact with dynamic obstacles, which might lead to a collision in some critical parking scenarios. To overcome these issues, we proposed a method based on reinforcement learning, which uses the RL-policy (from POLAMP) allowing us to take into account the kinematic constraints of the vehicle, static and dynamic obstacles. The proposed method was fully integrated into the Apollo platform with developed Cyber RT nodes, which were used for publishing the parking trajectory from our algorithm to the SVL simulator through a ROS/Cyber bridge. The final model demonstrates transferability to the previously unseen experimental environments and flexibility with respect to built-in hybrid A*.},

@article{Panov2022,
abstract = {The tasks of behavior planning and decision-making learning in a dynamic environment are usually divided and considered separately in control systems for intelligent agents. A new unified hierarchical formulation of the problem of simultaneous learning and planning (SLAP) is proposed in the context of object-oriented reinforcement learning, and an architecture of a cognitive agent that solves this problem is described. A new algorithm for learning actions in a partially observed external environment is proposed using a reward signal, an object-oriented subject description of the states of the external environment, and dynamically updated action plans. The main properties and advantages of the proposed algorithm are considered, including the lack of a fixed cognitive cycle necessitating the separation of planning and learning subsystems in earlier algorithms and the ability to construct and update the model of interaction with the environment, thus increasing the learning efficiency. A theoretical justification of some provisions of this approach is given, a model example is proposed, and the principle of operation of a SLAP agent when driving an unmanned vehicle is demonstrated.},

The presence of numerous dynamic obstacles makes the driving environment unpredictable. The planning algorithm should be safe, reactive, and adaptable to environmental changes. The paper presents an adaptive maneuver planning algorithm based on an evolving behavior tree created with genetic programming. In addition, we make a technical contribution to the Baidu Apollo autonomous driving platform, allowing the platform to test and develop overtaking maneuver planning algorithms.},
