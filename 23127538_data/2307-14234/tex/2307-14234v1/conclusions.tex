A cascaded architecture for nonlinear control of an active magnetic bearings system was proposed in this study. The design employed two sliding mode control loops with an adaptive estimator for inversion of the nonlinear input mapping. The asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system origin was proven and verified in simulation. The results showed that the proposed control strategy achieves robust positioning of the rotor axle in the vertical axis as well as tracking of smooth position profiles and the same time it is able to reject bounded disturbances. Future extensions of this work will include experimental verification of the design and investigation of higher-order sliding mode controllers, such as the super twisting algorithm for robust control of \gls{AMB} systems.
