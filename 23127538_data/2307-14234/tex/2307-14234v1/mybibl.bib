Design of a number of new 2-sliding controllers is demonstrated by means of the proposed homogeneity-based approach. A recently developed robust exact differentiator being applied, robust output-feedback controllers with finite-time convergence are produced, capable to control any general uncertain single-input–single-output process with relative degree 2. An effective simple procedure is developed to attenuate the 1-sliding mode chattering. Simulation of new controllers is presented. "

When the plant relative degree is higher than one, it is known [10] that a self-sustained periodic oscillation takes place in the feedback system. The purpose of the present work is that of illustrating a systematic procedure for control tuning based on Describing Function (DF) approach guaranteeing pre-specified frequency and magnitude of the resulting oscillation. The knowledge of the plant's Harmonic Response (magnitude and phase) at the desired chattering frequency is the only required prior information. By means of a simulation example, we show the effectiveness of the proposed procedure. © 2012 IEEE.},

The key-point of the paper is to consider that the bounds of uncertainties and perturbations are not known. Then, the proposed control approach consists in using dynamically adapted control gains that ensure the establishment, in a finite time, of a real second order sliding mode. The important feature of the adaptation algorithm is in non-overestimating the values of the control gains. A formal proof of the finite time convergence of the closed-loop system is derived using the Lyapunov function technique. The efficiency of the controller is evaluated on an experimental set-up. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The considered system class comprises single-input systems which are affected by structured and unstructured uncertainties. The design is based on a Lyapunov function for the super-twisting algorithm. This Lyapunov function is exploited to derive the adaptive part of the proposed controller using the certainty equivalence principle. It is demonstrated that this combination of sliding-mode and adaptive control methodology allows to relax the boundedness condition known from the super-twisting algorithm while reducing the sliding-mode gain significantly. The effectiveness of the presented concept is demonstrated in detail, using results from numerical simulations and experimental data of a laboratory testbed.},

The structure is parameterised by two scalar gains, both of which adapt, and by an additional time-varying term. The magnitudes of the adaptive terms are allowed to both increase and decrease as appropriate so that they are as small as possible, in the sense that they do not unnecessarily over-bound the uncertainty, and yet are large enough to sustain a sliding motion. In the paper, a new time varying gain is incorporated into the traditional super-twisting architecture. The proposed adaption law has a dual-layer structure which is formally analyzed using Lyapunov techniques. The additional term has the effect of simplifying the stability analysis whilst guaranteeing the second-order sliding mode properties of the traditional super-twisting scheme.},
