The task of the current controller is to ensure that the appropriate current deviation $i_{ref}$ is generated by the \gls{AMB} coils such that the demanded total magnetic force is applied to the rotor mass for its axial positioning. Let the current tracking error be denoted by $e = i - i_{ref}$. Its dynamics reads:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:current_dynamics}
	\dot{e} = \frac{di}{dt} - \frac{di_{ref}}{dt} = \frac{2 \dot{z}}{s_0 + z}i + \frac{2(s_0 + z)}{\mu_0 n^2 A}(u - Ri) + q_i - \frac{di_{ref}}{dt} \; .
\end{equation}
The control law
\begin{equation} \label{eq:i_control_law}
	u = \frac{\mu_0 n^2 A}{2(s_0 + z)}\left[ -\frac{2 \dot{z}}{s_0 + z}i + \frac{di_{ref}}{dt} - k_i\text{sgn}(e) \right] + Ri, \; k_i > Q_i
\end{equation}
gives the closed-loop dynamics $\dot{e} = -k_i\text{sgn}(e) + q_i$, which has a finite-time stable equilibrium point at the origin. Note that $\frac{di_{ref}}{dt}$ is known from \eqref{eq:adaptive_law} by design.
