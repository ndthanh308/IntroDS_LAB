@FOOTNOTE{Note99,key="Note99",note="This definition is dependent on the precise choice of conformal primaries out of a supermultiplet, with simple shifts of quantum numbers relating them. For example, the definition of the intercept in \cite {Costa:2012cb,Brower:2014wha} is $\protect \mathaccentV {tilde}07E{\alpha }=\protect \mathaccentV {tilde}07E{S}(\Delta =2)$, that is related to our choice as $\protect \mathaccentV {tilde}07E{\alpha }= \alpha +2$."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="Around these points, one can study the near-BPS limit of the expansion, i.e. the Taylor series of $\Delta $ with respect to $S$: $\Delta = 3+(1+f_1) S + f_2 S^2 +\protect \ldots  $, with $f_1$ the slope \cite {Basso:2011rs} and $f_2$ the curvature\cite {Gromov:2014bva} functions, both known exactly. Fitting our data in FIG.~\ref {fig:leadingtraj}, we reproduce $f_1$ and $f_2$ for $g=1/100,1/10,1/2$ with 8 and 7 digits of precision, respectively."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="We choose the branch cuts to run perpendicular to and away from the real $(\Delta ,S)$ plane."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="In FIG.~\ref {fig:RiemannReal} the only visible cyan BPs are on the third sheet. However, they appear also in the second sheet but outside the region of our plot."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note4,key="Note4",note="We note that at tree-level $\protect \mathcal  {O}_\pm $ are long linear combinations of length-$5$ elementary fields and their derivatives and are not simply a combination of Tr$D^2 Z ZZZZ$- and Tr$DZDZZZZ$-type states (cf. SM). The protected operator Tr$(Z^5)$ is also not on either trajectory."}
