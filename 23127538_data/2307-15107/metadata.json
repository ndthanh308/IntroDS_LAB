  "abstract": "We study a family of higher-twist Regge trajectories in $\\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory using the Quantum Spectral Curve. We explore the many-sheeted Riemann surface connecting the different trajectories and show the interplay between the degenerate non-local operators known as horizontal trajectories. We resolve their degeneracy analytically by computing the first non-trivial order of the Regge intercept at weak coupling, which exhibits new behaviour: it depends linearly on the coupling. This is consistent with our numerics, which interpolate all the way to strong coupling.",
