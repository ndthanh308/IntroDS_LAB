abstract = {It is considered that some vertical convection as well as possible turbulence in an early phase of solar nebula soon terminates owing to diminution of the temperature dependence of dust opacity due to rapid growth of dust particles. We reexamine settling and growth of dust particles in the subsequent laminar phase of the solar nebula in detail, treating a dust layer as a two-component fluid composed of the dust and the gas. We obtain analytic expressions for the settling path, the growing size, and the settling time. The settling process is divided into two phases, i.e., an early gas-dominant phase and a later dust-dominant phase. So far, only the former phase, where the particle path finally turns from vertical to radial, has been investigated. In the latter phase, dust particles drag the gas, rather than the gas does dust particles. Consequently, the particle path turns from radial to vertical. Dust particles grow most appreciably and rapidly in a radially sweeping phase. The final radii of dust particles at the onset of gravitational instability of the dust layer are 20, 5.9, and 0.60 cm in the Earth's, Jupiter's, and Neptune's zones, respectively. These values are much smaller than those obtained previously by S.J. Weidenschilling [1980, Icarus44, 172–189] and Y. Nakagawa et al. [1981, Icarus45, 517–528]. The total settling times are 1.9 × 103, 4.6 × 103, and 2.8 × 104 years in the above-mentioned three zones, respectively. These are somewhat smaller than those obtained by the previous studies. Most of the settling time is spent in the early vertically settling phase.}

abstract = {New numerical simulations of the formation and evolution of Jupiter are presented. The formation model assumes that first a solid core of several M⊕ accretes from the planetesimals in the protoplanetary disk, and then the core captures a massive gaseous envelope from the protoplanetary disk. Earlier studies of the core accretion–gas capture model [Pollack, J.B., Hubickyj, O., Bodenheimer, P., Lissauer, J.J., Podolak, M., Greenzweig, Y., 1996. Icarus 124, 62–85] demonstrated that it was possible for Jupiter to accrete with a solid core of 10–30 M⊕ in a total formation time comparable to the observed lifetime of protoplanetary disks. Recent interior models of Jupiter and Saturn that agree with all observational constraints suggest that Jupiter's core mass is 0–11 M⊕ and Saturn's is 9–22 M⊕ [Saumon, G., Guillot, T., 2004. Astrophys. J. 609, 1170–1180]. We have computed simulations of the growth of Jupiter using various values for the opacity produced by grains in the protoplanet's atmosphere and for the initial planetesimal surface density, σinit,Z, in the protoplanetary disk. We also explore the implications of halting the solid accretion at selected core mass values during the protoplanet's growth. Halting planetesimal accretion at low core mass simulates the presence of a competing embryo, and decreasing the atmospheric opacity due to grains emulates the settling and coagulation of grains within the protoplanet's atmosphere. We examine the effects of adjusting these parameters to determine whether or not gas runaway can occur for small mass cores on a reasonable timescale. We compute four series of simulations with the latest version of our code, which contains updated equation of state and opacity tables as well as other improvements. Each series consists of a run without a cutoff in planetesimal accretion, plus up to three runs with a cutoff at a particular core mass. The first series of runs is computed with an atmospheric opacity due to grains (hereafter referred to as ‘grain opacity’) that is 2\% of the interstellar value and σinit,Z=10g/cm2. Cutoff runs are computed for core masses of 10, 5, and 3 M⊕. The second series of Jupiter models is computed with the grain opacity at the full interstellar value and σinit,Z=10g/cm2. Cutoff runs are computed for core masses of 10 and 5 M⊕. The third series of runs is computed with the grain opacity at 2\% of the interstellar value and σinit,Z=6g/cm2. One cutoff run is computed with a core mass of 5 M⊕. The final series consists of one run, without a cutoff, which is computed with a temperature dependent grain opacity (i.e., 2\% of the interstellar value for T<350K ramping up to the full interstellar value for T>500K) and σinit,Z=10g/cm2. Our results demonstrate that reducing grain opacities results in formation times less than half of those for models computed with full interstellar grain opacity values. The reduction of opacity due to grains in the upper portion of the envelope with T⩽500K has the largest effect on the lowering of the formation time. If the accretion of planetesimals is not cut off prior to the accretion of gas, then decreasing the surface density of planetesimals lowers the final core mass of the protoplanet, but increases the formation timescale considerably. Finally, a core mass cutoff results in a reduction of the time needed for a protoplanet to evolve to the stage of runaway gas accretion, provided the cutoff mass is sufficiently large. The overall results indicate that, with reasonable parameters, it is possible that Jupiter formed at 5 AU via the core accretion process in 1 Myr with a core of 10 M⊕ or in 5 Myr with a core of 5 M⊕.}

abstract = {We present Very Large Array observations at λ = 3.5 cm of the nearby young star TW Hya that show the emission is constant in time over weeks, months, and years, and spatially resolved with peak brightness temperature ~10 K at ~0.″25 (15 AU) resolution. These features are naturally explained if the emission mechanism at this wavelength is thermal emission from dust particles in the disk surrounding the star. To account quantitatively for the observations, we construct a self-consistent accretion disk model that incorporates a population of centmeter-size particles that matches the long-wavelength spectrum and spatial distribution. A substantal mass fraction of orbiting particles in the TW Hya disk must have agglomerated to centmeter size. These data provide the first clear indication that dust emission from protoplanetary disks may be observed at centmeter wavelengths, and that changes in the spectral slope of the dust emission may be detected, providing constraints on dust evolution and the planet formation process.}

title = {Angular Momentum Accretion onto a Gas Giant Planet},
journal = {\apj},
abstract = {We investigate the accretion of angular momentum onto a protoplanet system using three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations. We consider a local region around a protoplanet in a protoplanetary disk with sufficiently high spatial resolution. We describe the structure of the gas flow onto and around the protoplanet in detail. We find that the gas flows onto the protoplanet system in the vertical direction, crossing the shock front near the Hill radius of the protoplanet, which is qualitatively different from the picture established by two-dimensional simulations. The specific angular momentum of the gas accreted by the protoplanet system increases with the protoplanet's mass. At a Jovian orbit, when the protoplanet's mass Mp is Mp≲ 1MJup, where MJup is the Jovian mass, the specific angular momentum increases as j ∝ Mp. On the other hand, it increases as j ∝ Mp2/3 when the protoplanet's mass is Mp≳ 1MJup. The stronger dependence of the specific angular momentum on the protoplanet's mass for Mp≲ 1MJup is due to the thermal pressure of the gas. The estimated total angular momentum of a system of a gas giant planet and a circumplanetary disk is 2 orders of magnitude larger than those of the present gas giant planets in the solar system. A large fraction of the total angular momentum contributes to the formation of the circumplanetary disk. We also discuss the formation of satellites from the circumplanetary disk.}

abstract = {New numerical simulations of the formation of the giant planets are presented, in which for the first time both the gas and planetesimal accretion rates are calculated in a self-consistent, interactive fashion. The simulations combine three elements: (1) three-body accretion cross sections of solids onto an isolated planetary embryo, (2) a stellar evolution code for the planet's gaseous envelope, and (3) a planetesimal dissolution code within the envelope, used to evaluate the planet's effective capture radius and the energy deposition profile of accreted material. Major assumptions include: The planet is embedded in a disk of gas and small planetesimals with locally uniform initial surface mass density, and planetesimals are not allowed to migrate into or out of the planet's feeding zone. All simulations are characterized by three major phases. During the first phase, the planet's mass consists primarily of solid material. The planetesimal accretion rate, which dominates that of gas, rapidly increases owing to runaway accretion, then decreases as the planet's feeding zone is depleted. During the second phase, both solid and gas accretion rates are small and nearly independent of time. The third phase, marked by runaway gas accretion, starts when the solid and gas masses are about equal. It is engendered by a strong positive feedback on the gas accretion rates, driven by the rapid contraction of the gaseous envelope and the rapid expansion of the outer boundary, which depends on the planet's total mass. The overall evolutionary time scale is generally determined by the length of the second phase. The actual rates at which the giant planets accreted small planetesimals is probably intermediate between the constant rates assumed in most previous studies and the highly variable rates used here. Within the context of the adopted model of planetesimal accretion, the joint constraints of the time scale for dissipation of the solar nebula and the current high-Zmasses of the giant planets lead to estimates of the initial surface density (σinit) of planetesimals in the outer region of the solar nebula. The results show that σinit≈ 10 g cm−2near Jupiter's orbit and that σinit∝a−2, whereais the distance from the Sun. These values are a factor of 3 to 4 times as high as that of the “minimum-mass” solar nebula at Jupiter's distance and a factor of 2 to 3 times as high at Saturn's distance. The estimates for the formation time of Jupiter and Saturn are 1 to 10 million years, whereas those for Uranus fall in the range 2 to 16 million years. These estimates follow from the properties of our Solar System and do not necessarily apply to giant planets in other planetary systems.}

And we evaluated q numerically by coplanar and off-planar orbital integration. The results are summarized in terms of e and i, which are the eccentricity and inclination of the relative motion scaled by the reduced Hill radius h; h is defined as (mp/3M⊙)13, where mp is the mass of the protoplanet. q(e, i) has four properties: (i) q(e, i) depends very weakly on i, (ii) q(e, i) is negative (i.e., retrograde) for e < 1, (iii) q(e, i) has a narrow prograde region in 1 ⩽ e ⩽ 2, and (iv) q(e, i) is reduced to zero as e and i increase. Averaging the q(e, i) obtained over the Gaussian velocity distribution of planetesimal swarm, we examined the rotation of terrestrial planets; Earth's and Mars' rotations are realized if e in the late accumulation stage is 1–2, which is a reasonable value in the light of planetary accumulation theory.}

abstract = {The rotation rate of a planet which accretes from small, solid planetesimals is computed as a function of the eccentricities of the planetesimals' orbits. Planets acquire spin angular momentum from the relative motion of planetesimals at impact. The calculations presented herein assume that the planet is spherical and that its orbit is circular. The planetesimals orbit in or very near the plane of the planet's orbit and are uniformly distributed in periapse longitude. Unless otherwise stated, the planetesimal distribution is also assumed to be uniform in semimajor axis. The stochastic effects of accretion of large planetesimals are ignored. The spin angular momentum produced by a particular collision can be either positive or negative; due to symmetries these contributions nearly cancel. Thus, in order to obtain meaningful nonzero results, perturbation expansions must be carried through to second order in the ratio of the planet's radius to the amplitude of the radial excursions of the planetesimals, and numerical simulations require the calculation of a very large number of impacts. We find that nongravitating planets accreted from the disk of planetesimals described above rotate very slowly in the prograde direction; their spin period is longer than their orbital period. When the planet's gravity is included in a three-body treatment of the problem, the rotation rate is a function of eH, the ratio of the amplitude of the planetesimals' radial (eccentric) motion to the radius of the planet's Hill Sphere, and rH, the ratio of the planet's radius to the radius of its Hill Sphere. The number of rotations per orbit generally increases as rH decreases. For eH ≲ 1 (nearly circular initial orbits), the planet rotates in the retrograde direction. Rotation is prograde for larger eccentricities. For small rH, the rotation rate peaks at eH ≈1.2 and decreases to the nongravitating limit as eH → ∞. The maximum rates of systematic prograde rotation are comparable to those observed in our Solar System; however, rapid prograde rotation only occurs for a very narrow range of eH values. In simulations which start with a Rayleigh distribution of planetesimal eccentricities, we find that the maximum prograde rotation rates are much slower than those observed in the Solar System, suggesting that other factors are important. Material accreted from near the outer edges of a planet's feeding zone tends to provide the planet with positive spin angular momentum. If the surface mass density in these regions is greater than that in the rest of the planet's accretion zone, due, e.g., to the expansion of a growing planet's feeding range into parts of the disk not depleted by previous accretion, then the observed spin periods of the planets could be accounted for. Alternatively, the stochastic component of rotation due to impacts of large planetesimals may overwhelm the ordered prograde component of rotation for solid planets, and/or unmodeled effects, such as the orbital eccentricity of a growing planet, might be important in determining planetary rotation rates.}

Lissauer 1990,Icarus87, 40–77, and 1992,Icarus100, 440–463) to the case of a planet on an eccentric orbit. We have found that the dependence of accretion rates on planetary and planetesimal eccentricities can be reduced to a single parameter and that the extent of a planet's single-pass feeding zones depends (in the limit of small planetary mass) only upon the sum of the eccentricities of the planet and the planetesimals and their mutual inclination. We have also addressed the problem of the origin of planetary rotation by calculating the spin angular momentum contributed by all particles which are accreted by a planet in a uniform particle disk. Previous authors (J. J. Lissauer and D. M. Kary 1991,Icarus94, 126–159; L. Dones and S. Tremaine 1993,Icarus103, 67–92) have obtained analytic solutions for nongravitating planets on circular orbits in two-dimensional disks. We have developed new techniques which allow us to extend these calculations to the cases in which the planet's orbit is eccentric and the disk is three-dimensional. Nongravitating planets on eccentric orbits accrete the same specific rotational angular momentum as planets on circular orbits in disks of planetesimals on eccentric orbits. Planetesimal inclinations reduce the specific angular momentum accreted by nongravitating planets by 25–65\%. By performing a series of numerical three-body simulations, we have found that a gravitating planet on an orbit with eccentricitye0⪡ in a disk of planetesimals on circular orbits obtains the same rotation rate as a planet on a circular orbit in a disk of planetesimals which havee=e0. When the planet and the planetesimals are both on eccentric orbits withe⪡ 1, the spin angular momentum is determined by the distribution of relative eccentricity vectors. If the eccentricities of the planet and planetesimals differ significantly, inclination typically acts to reduce the magnitude of the rotation rate by a few tens of percent. However, in certain cases where the eccentricities of the planet and planetesimals are comparable, inclination can change slow retrograde rotation to slow prograde rotation. A planet which accretes material primarily from the extremities of its feeding zone during the latter stage of its growth attains rapid systematic prograde rotation only if the amplitude of its epicyclic motion is comparable to or smaller than the radius of its Hill sphere.}

abstract = {We examine the rate of accretion of mass and spin angular momentum by a spherical solid body ("planet") immersed in a differentially rotating disk of particles ("planetesimals"). If the planet travels on a circular orbit, the accretion process is described by two dimensionless parameters r and s , which measure the ratio of the planet's radius to its Hill radius and the ratio of the rms radial velocity of the planetesimals to the shear across the Hill radius, respectively. Using a combination of analytic arguments and numerical simulations, we derive the mass and angular momentum accretion rates and their scaling with r and s. By introducing an additional parameter, the effective mass of the planetesimals relative to the planet, we can derive the obliquities and spins arising from the stochastic nature of the accretion process. Our results are consistent with those of previous calculations by J. J. Lissauer and D. M. Kary (Icarus 94, 126-159 (1991)) wherever there is overlap in parameter space. In particular, we conclude that ordered accretion from a uniform or slowly varying disk of small bodies cannot result in rotation as rapid as that of Earth or Mars for any value of the disk velocity dispersion s. The spin rates of these planets are most naturally explained as arising from one or a few "giant" impacts by planetesimals.}

In the case of ordered accretion, the planet's obliquity is expected to be near 0° or 180°, whereas, if accretion is stochastic, there should be a wide range of obliquities. Analytic arguments and extensive orbital integrations are used to calculate the expected distributions of spin rate and obliquity as a function of the planetesimal mass and velocity distributions.

The initial spin state of terrestrial planets is determined at this stage. We statistically investigate the spin parameters of terrestrial planets assembled from protoplanets using N-body simulations. As initial conditions, we adopt the oligarchic growth model of protoplanets. For the standard disk model, typically two Earth-sized planets form in the terrestrial planet region. We find that the spin angular velocity of the planets is well expressed by a Gaussian distribution, and their obliquity is well expressed by an isotropic distribution. The typical spin angular velocity is given by the critical spin angular velocity for rotational instability under the assumption of perfect accretion in collisions. We show the dependencies of the spin parameters on the initial protoplanet system parameters. The initial orbital separation and velocity anisotropy of protoplanets barely affect the spin parameters. The bulk density of protoplanets does not affect the obliquity distribution, while the spin angular velocity increases with the bulk density.}

The distribution of obliquities was found to be isotropic, which means that planets can rotate in direct or indirect sense, regardless of their mass. Our results regarding the primordial rotation periods show that they are dependent on the region where the embryo was formed and evolved.

abstract = {Planet formation models suggest the primordial main belt experienced a short but intense period of collisional evolution shortly after the formation of planetary embryos. This period is believed to have lasted until Jupiter reached its full size, when dynamical processes (e.g., sweeping resonances, excitation via planetary embryos) ejected most planetesimals from the main belt zone. The few planetesimals left behind continued to undergo comminution at a reduced rate until the present day. We investigated how this scenario affects the main belt size distribution over Solar System history using a collisional evolution model (CoEM) that accounts for these events. CoEM does not explicitly include results from dynamical models, but instead treats the unknown size of the primordial main belt and the nature/timing of its dynamical depletion using innovative but approximate methods. Model constraints were provided by the observed size frequency distribution of the asteroid belt, the observed population of asteroid families, the cratered surface of differentiated Asteroid (4) Vesta, and the relatively constant crater production rate of the Earth and Moon over the last 3 Gyr. Using CoEM, we solved for both the shape of the initial main belt size distribution after accretion and the asteroid disruption scaling law QD∗. In contrast to previous efforts, we find our derived QD∗ function is very similar to results produced by numerical hydrocode simulations of asteroid impacts. Our best fit results suggest the asteroid belt experienced as much comminution over its early history as it has since it reached its low-mass state approximately 3.9–4.5 Ga. These results suggest the main belt's wavy-shaped size-frequency distribution is a “fossil” from this violent early epoch. We find that most diameter D≳120 km asteroids are primordial, with their physical properties likely determined during the accretion epoch. Conversely, most smaller asteroids are byproducts of fragmentation events. The observed changes in the asteroid spin rate and lightcurve distributions near D∼100–120 km are likely to be a byproduct of this difference. Estimates based on our results imply the primordial main belt population (in the form of D<1000 km bodies) was 150–250 times larger than it is today, in agreement with recent dynamical simulations.}

title = {SPINS OF LARGE ASTEROIDS: A HINT OF A PRIMORDIAL DISTRIBUTION IN THEIR SPIN RATES},
journal = {\aj},
abstract = {The Asteroid Belt and the Kuiper Belt are relics from the formation of our solar system. Understanding the size and spin distribution of the two belts is crucial for a deeper understanding of the formation of our solar system and the dynamical processes that govern it. In this paper, we investigate the effect of collisions on the evolution of the spin distribution of asteroids and KBOs. We find that the power law nature of the impactors’ size distribution leads to a Lévy distribution of the spin rates. This results in a power law tail in the spin distribution, in stark contrast to the usually quoted Maxwellian distribution. We show that for bodies larger than 10 km, collisions alone lead to spin rates peaking at 0.15–0.5 revolutions per day. Comparing that to the observed spin rates of large asteroids (R $>$ 50 km), we find that the spins of large asteroids, peaking at ∼1–2 revolutions per day, are dominated by a primordial component that reflects the formation mechanism of the asteroids. Similarly, the Kuiper Belt has undergone virtually no collisional spin evolution, assuming current densities. Collisions contribute a spin rate of ∼0.01 revolutions per day, thus the observed fast spin rates of KBOs are also primordial in nature.}

Particle streams interacting with the gas within the Hill sphere of the protoplanet spiral into a prograde circumplanetary disc. Material is accreted on to the protoplanet due to stirring by the turbulent surroundings. We speculate that the trend for prograde rotation among the largest asteroids is primordial and that protoplanets accreted 10–50 per cent of their mass from pebbles and rocks during the gaseous solar nebula phase. Our model also offers a possible explanation for the narrow range of spin periods observed among the largest bodies in the asteroid and trans-Neptunian belts, and predicts that 1000-km-scale Kuiper Belt objects that have not experienced giant impacts should preferentially spin in the prograde direction.}",

    abstract = "{In the core accretion paradigm of planet formation, gas giants only form a massive atmosphere after their progenitors exceeded a threshold mass: the critical core mass. Most (exo)planets, being smaller and rock/ice-dominated, never crossed this line. Nevertheless, they were massive enough to attract substantial amounts of gas from the disc, while their atmospheres remained in pressure-equilibrium with the disc. Our goal is to characterize the hydrodynamical properties of the atmospheres of such embedded planets and the implications for their (long-term) evolution. In this paper – the first in series – we start to investigate the properties of an isothermal and inviscid flow past a small, embedded planet by conducting local, 2D hydrodynamical simulations. Using the pluto code, we confirm that the flow is steady and bound. This steady outcome is most apparent for the log-polar grid (with the grid spacing proportional to the distance from the planet). For low-mass planets, Cartesian grids are somewhat less efficient as they have difficulty to follow the circular, large speeds in the deep atmosphere. Relating the amount of rotation to the gas fraction of the atmosphere, we find that more massive atmospheres rotate faster – a finding consistent with Kelvin's circulation theorem. Rotation therefore limits the amount of gas that planets can acquire from the nebula. Dependent on the Toomre-Q parameter of the circumstellar disc, the planet's atmosphere will reach Keplerian rotation before self-gravity starts to become important.}",

Previous three-dimensional (3D) hydrodynamical simulations indicate that atmospheres of low-mass planets cannot be considered isolated from the protoplanetary disc, contrary to what is assumed in 1D-evolutionary calculations. This finding is referred to as the recycling hypothesis. In this paper, we investigate the recycling hypothesis for super-Earth planets, accounting for realistic 3D radiation hydrodynamics. Also, we conduct a direct comparison in terms of the evolution of the entropy between 1D and 3D geometries. We clearly see that 3D atmospheres maintain higher entropy: although gas in the atmosphere loses entropy through radiative cooling, the advection of high-entropy gas from the disc into the Bondi/Hill sphere slows down Kelvin–Helmholtz contraction, potentially arresting envelope growth at a sub-critical gas mass fraction. Recycling, therefore, operates vigorously, in line with results by previous studies. However, we also identify an ‘inner core’ – in size ≈25 per cent of the Bondi radius – where streamlines are more circular and entropies are much lower than in the outer atmosphere. Future studies at higher resolutions are needed to assess whether this region can become hydrodynamically isolated on long time-scales.}",

Rapid recycling of the envelope gas of planets embedded in a protoplanetary disc has been proposed to delay the cooling and following accretion of disc gas. We compare isothermal and non-isothermal 3D hydrodynamical simulations of the gas flow past a planet to investigate the influence on the feasibility of the recycling mechanism. Radiative cooling is implemented by using the β cooling model. We find that, in either case, gas enters the Bondi sphere at high latitudes and leaves through the mid-plane regions, or vice versa when disc gas rotates sub-Keplerian. However, in contrast to the isothermal case where the recycling flow reaches the deeper part of the envelope, the inflow is inhibited from reaching the deep envelope in the non-isothermal case. Once the atmosphere starts cooling, buoyant force prevents the high-entropy disc gas from intruding the low-entropy atmosphere. We suggest that the buoyancy barrier isolates the lower envelope from the recycling and allows further cooling, which may lead runaway gas accretion on to the core.}",

    abstract = {We perform global three-dimensional (3D) radiation-hydrodynamics calculations of the envelopes surrounding young planetary cores of 5, 10, and 15 Earth masses, located in a protoplanetary disk at 5 and 10 AU from a solar-mass star. We apply a nested-grid technique to resolve the thermodynamics of the disk at the orbital-radius length scale and that of the envelope at the core-radius length scale. The gas is modeled as a solar mixture of molecular and atomic hydrogen, helium, and their ions. The equation of state accounts for both gas and radiation, and gas energy includes contributions from rotational and vibrational states of molecular hydrogen and from ionization of atomic species. Dust opacities are computed from first principles, applying the full Mie theory. One-dimensional (1D) calculations of planet formation are used to supplement the 3D calculations by providing energy deposition rates in the envelope due to solids accretion. We compare 1D and 3D envelopes and find that masses and gas accretion rates agree within factors of 2, and so do envelope temperatures. The trajectories of passive tracers are used to define the size of 3D envelopes, resulting in radii much smaller than the Hill radius and smaller than the Bondi radius. The moments of inertia and angular momentum of the envelopes are determined and the rotation rates are derived from the rigid-body approximation, resulting in slow bulk rotation. We find that the polar flattening is ≲ 0.05. The dynamics of the accretion flow are examined by tracking the motion of tracers that move into the envelope. The anisotropy of this flow is characterized in terms of both its origin and impact site at the envelope surface. Gas merges with the envelope preferentially at mid- to high latitudes.}
