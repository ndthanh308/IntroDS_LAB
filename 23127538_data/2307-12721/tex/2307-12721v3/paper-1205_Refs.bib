  abstract  = "BackgroundHigh-risk human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive women
               require triage to identify those at higher risk of cervical
               intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2 or worse (CIN2+). We aimed to
               compare visual assessment of the cervix, manual cytology and
               automated cytology as triage tests to screen HPV-positive women,
               and to assess over-treatment rates after visual assessment and
               over-referral rates to colposcopy after cytology.MethodsThe
               present cross-sectional study is nested in a large prospective
               screening trial in Cameroon. Evaluations of the tests have been
               conducted individually and in combination with HPV-16/HPV-18/45
               genotyping. For the evaluation of over-treatment and colposcopic
               over-referral, we simulated two screening scenarios: (1)
               one-visit scenario (test-triage-and-treatment); and (2)
               two-visit scenario (test-triage-and-colposcopy).Results1582
               women with a median age of 40 years (IQR 35--45) performed
               self-sampling for HPV testing, of which 294 (18.6\%) were
               HPV-positive, and 12.2\% had CIN2+. Sensitivities for CIN2+
               detection were 77.1\% for visual assessment, 80.0\% for manual
               cytology, and 84.8\% for automated cytology. Sensitivity of
               combined tests was higher compared with single tests. The
               highest sensitivity was obtained by the combination of
               genotyping and automated cytology (91.2\%). In the one-visit
               scenario, the over-treatment rate was 83.9\% in referred women,
               with a ratio of 6.2 treated women per CIN2+. In the two-visit
               scenario, the lowest over-referral rate would have been under
               manual cytology (45.0\%), with a ratio of 1.8 referred women per
               CIN2+. Single and combined triage strategies by automated
               cytology gave rise to over-referral rates of 69.2\% and 76.7\%,
               respectively, and a ratio of 3.2 and 4.3 referred women per
               CIN2+, respectively.DiscussionTriage of HPV-positive women using
               a combination of genotyping and automated cytology for CIN2+
               detection may provide public benefits in low- and middle-income

abstract = {While a publicly available benchmark dataset provides a base for the development of new algorithms and comparison of results, hospital-based data collected from the real-world clinical setup is also very important in AI-based medical research for automated disease diagnosis, prediction or classifications as per standard protocol. Primary data must be constantly updated so that the developed algorithms achieve as much accuracy as possible in the regional context. This dataset would support research work related to image segmentation and final classification for a complete decision support system (https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tice.2020.101347) [1]. Liquid-based cytology (LBC) is one of the cervical screening tests. The repository consists of a total of 963 LBC images sub-divided into four sets representing the four classes: NILM, LSIL, HSIL, and SCC. It comprises pre-cancerous and cancerous lesions related to cervical cancer as per standards under The Bethesda System (TBS). The images were captured in 40x magnification using Leica ICC50 HD microscope collected with due consent from 460 patients visiting the O&G department of the public hospital with various gynaecological problems. The images were then viewed and categorized by experts of the pathology department.}
