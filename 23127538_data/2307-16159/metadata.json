  "abstract": "We show that any bounded integral function $f : A \\times B \\mapsto \\{0,1, \\dots, Δ\\}$ with rank $r$ has deterministic communication complexity $Δ^{O(Δ)} \\cdot \\sqrt{r} \\cdot \\log r$, where the rank of $f$ is defined to be the rank of the $A \\times B$ matrix whose entries are the function values. As a corollary, we show that any $n$-dimensional polytope that admits a slack matrix with entries from $\\{0,1,\\dots,Δ\\}$ has extension complexity at most $\\exp(Δ^{O(Δ)} \\cdot \\sqrt{n} \\cdot \\log n)$.",
