  "abstract": "Acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) aims to remove interference signals while leaving near-end speech least distorted. As the indistinguishable patterns between near-end speech and interference signals, near-end speech can't be separated completely, causing speech distortion and interference signals residual. We observe that besides target positive information, e.g., ground-truth speech and features, the target negative information, such as interference signals and features, helps make pattern of target speech and interference signals more discriminative. Therefore, we present a novel AEC model encoder-decoder architecture with the guidance of negative information termed as CMNet. A collaboration module (CM) is designed to establish the correlation between the target positive and negative information in a learnable manner via three blocks: target positive, target negative, and interactive block. Experimental results demonstrate our CMNet achieves superior performance than recent methods.",
