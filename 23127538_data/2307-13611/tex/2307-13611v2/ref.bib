	abstract = {I show that the gravitational dynamics in a bulk region of space can be connected to a thermodynamic description in the boundary of that region, thereby providing clear physical interpretations of several mathematical features of classical general relativity: (1) The Noether charge contained in a bulk region, associated with a specific time evolution vector field, has a direct thermodynamic interpretation as the gravitational heat content of the boundary surface. (2) This result, in turn, shows that all static spacetimes maintain holographic equipartition in the following sense: In these spacetimes, the number of degrees of freedom in the boundary is equal to the number of degrees of freedom in the bulk. (3) In a general, evolving spacetime, the rate of change of gravitational momentum is related to the difference between the number of bulk and boundary degrees of freedom. It is this departure from the holographic equipartition which drives the time evolution of the spacetime. (4) When the equations of motion hold, the (naturally defined) total energy of the gravity plus matter within a bulk region, will be equal to the boundary heat content. (5) After motivating the need for an alternate description of gravity (if we have to solve the cosmological constant problem), I describe a thermodynamic variational principle based on null surfaces to achieve this goal. The concept of gravitational heat density of the null surfaces arises naturally from the Noether charge associated with the null congruence. The variational principle, in fact, extremises the total heat content of the matter plus gravity system. Several variations on this theme and implications are described.},

This holds for all space-times with a positive cosmological constant, including cosmologies dominated by ordinary matter, and recollapsing universes. The argument involves intermediate steps which may be of interest in their own right. We note that entropy cannot be observed unless it lies both in the past and in the future of the observer's history. This truncates space-time to a diamond-shaped subset well-suited to the application of the covariant entropy bound. We further require, and derive, a novel Bekenstein-like bound on matter entropy in asymptotically de Sitter spaces. Our main result lends support to the proposal that universes with positive cosmological constant are described by a fundamental theory with only a finite number of degrees of freedom.},

Although the black hole is classically stable, quantum particle creation processes will result in the emission of Hawking radiation to infinity and corresponding mass loss of the black hole, eventually resulting in the complete evaporation of the black hole. Semiclassical arguments strongly suggest that, in the process of black hole formation and evaporation, a pure quantum state will evolve to a mixed state, i.e. there will be ‘information loss’. There has been considerable controversy over this issue for more than 40 years. In this review, we present the arguments in favor of information loss, and analyze some of the counter-arguments and alternative possibilities.},

  abstract = {In statistical physics, useful notions of entropy are defined with respect to some coarse-graining procedure over a microscopic model. Here we consider some special problems that arise when the microscopic model is taken to be relativistic quantum field theory. These problems are associated with the existence of an infinite number of degrees of freedom per unit volume. Because of these the microscopic entropy can, and typically does, diverge for sharply localized states. However, the difference in the entropy between two such states is better behaved, and for most purposes it is the useful quantity to consider. In particular, a renormalized entropy can be defined as the entropy relative to the ground state. We make these remarks quantitative and precise in a simple model situation: the states of a conformal quantum field theory excited by a moving mirror. From this work, we attempt to draw some lessons concerning the “information problem” in black hole physics.},

	quantum field theory. This is defined as the von Neumann entropy
	SA = −Tr ρAlogρA 
	corresponding to the reduced density matrix
	ρA of a subsystem
	A. For the
	case of a 1+1-dimensional critical system, whose continuum limit is a conformal field theory with central charge
	c, we re-derive the result  of Holzhey et al when A 
	is a finite interval of length  in an infinite system, and extend it to many other cases: finite systems, finite temperatures, and when
	A 
	consists of an arbitrary number of disjoint intervals. For such a
	system away from its critical point, when the correlation length
	ξ 
	is large but finite, we show that , where  is the number of boundary points of
	A.
	These results are verified for a free massive field theory, which is also used to confirm a scaling ansatz
	for the case of finite size off-critical systems, and for integrable lattice models, such as the Ising and
	XXZ 
	models, which are solvable by corner transfer matrix methods. Finally the free field
	results are extended to higher dimensions, and used to motivate a scaling form for
	the singular part of the entanglement entropy near a quantum phase transition.},

  abstract  = {Black holes appear to conform to a very straightforward generalisation of standard laboratory thermodynamics. This generalised theory is examined in detail, and some concrete results are presented. The thermodynamic connection is based on Hawking's application of quantum theory to black holes, and the quantum aspects are described in detail from several standpoints, both heuristic and otherwise. The precise mechanism by which the black hole produces thermal radiation, its nature and origin, and the energetics of back-reaction on the hole are reviewed. The thermal states of quantum holes are also treated using the theory of thermal Green functions, and the entropy of the hole is shown to be related to the loss of information about the quantum states hidden behind the event horizon. Some related topics such as accelerated mirrors and observers in Minkowski space, super-radiance from rotating holes and the thermodynamics of general self-gravitating systems are also briefly discussed.},

  abstract  = {A general ansatz for gravitational entropy can be provided using the criterion that any patch of area which acts as a horizon for a suitably defined accelerated observer must have an entropy proportional to its area. After providing a brief justification for this ansatz, several consequences are derived. (i) In any static spacetime with a horizon and associated temperature β−1, this entropy satisfies the relation S = (1/2)βE where E is the energy source for gravitational acceleration, obtained as an integral of (Tab − (1/2)Tgab)uaub. (ii) With this ansatz of S, the minimization of Einstein–Hilbert action is equivalent to minimizing the free energy F with βF = βU − S where U is the integral of Tabuaub. We discuss the conditions under which these results imply S ∝ E2 and/or S ∝ U2 thereby generalizing the results known for black holes. This approach links with several other known results, especially the holographic views of spacetime.},

For the spin zero Bose gas, our model makes two predictions: (i) The horizon area/entropy is quantized as given by Bekenstein’s quantization rule, (ii) The model explains the correct type of proportionality between horizon area and entropy. However, for the physically relevant range of parameters, the proportionality constant is never equal to 1/4.},

  abstract = {Spacetimes with horizons show a resemblance to thermodynamic systems and it is possible to associate the notions of temperature and entropy with them. Several aspects of this connection are reviewed in a manner appropriate for broad readership. The approach uses two essential principles: (a) the physical theories must be formulated for each observer entirely in terms of variables any given observer can access and (b) consistent formulation of quantum field theory requires analytic continuation to the complex plane. These two principles, when used together in spacetimes with horizons, are powerful enough to provide several results in a unified manner. Since spacetimes with horizons have a generic behaviour under analytic continuation, standard results of quantum field theory in curved spacetimes with horizons can be obtained directly (Sections 3–7). The requirements (a) and (b) also put strong constraints on the action principle describing the gravity and, in fact, one can obtain the Einstein–Hilbert action from the thermodynamic considerations (Section 8). The review emphasises the thermodynamic aspects of horizons, which could be obtained from general principles and is expected to remain valid, independent of the microscopic description (‘statistical mechanics’) of horizons.},

I argue that this divergence, which arises even in the case of Rindler horizon in flat spacetime, is yet another indication of a deep connection between horizon thermodynamics and gravitational dynamics. In an emergent perspective of gravity, which accommodates this connection, the fluctuations around the equipartition value in the area elements will lead to a minimal quantum of area, of the order of L_P^2, which will act as a regulator for this divergence. In a particular prescription for incorporating L_P^2 as zero-point-area of spacetime, this does happen and the divergence in entanglement entropy is regularized, leading to S proportional to (A/L_P^2) in Einstein gravity. In more general models of gravity, the surface density of microscopic degrees of freedom is different which leads to a modified regularisation procedure and the possibility that the entanglement entropy - when appropriately regularised - matches the Wald entropy.},

In a harmonic chain we explore a quench of the frequency parameter. In a chain of free fermions at half filling we consider the evolution of the ground state of a fully dimerised chain through the homogeneous Hamiltonian. We focus on critical evolution Hamiltonians. The temporal evolutions of the gaps in the entanglement spectrum are analysed. The entanglement Hamiltonians in these models are characterised by matrices that provide also contours for the entanglement entropies. The temporal evolution of these contours for the entanglement entropy is studied, also by employing existing conformal field theory results for the semi-infinite line and the quasi-particle picture for the global quench.},

The equivalence between the existence of an order parameter and the orthogonality of different ground-state wavefunctions for a system undergoing a quantum phase transition is used to justify the introduction of the notions of irrelevant and relevant information as the counterparts of fluctuations and orders in the conventional description. The irrelevant and relevant information are quantified, which allows us to identify unstable and stable fixed points (in the sense of renormalization group theory) for quantum spin chains.},

The so called fidelity susceptibility and its relation to the usual thermodynamic susceptibilities and response functions are discussed.

Finally, we consider the fidelity between different reduced density matrices for a subsystem of a larger system.},

  abstract  = {Solutions of the Schrödinger equation with an exact time dependence are derived as eigenfunctions of dynamical invariants which are constructed from time-independent operators using time-dependent unitary transformations. Exact solutions and a closed form expression for the corresponding time evolution operator are found for a wide range of time-dependent Hamiltonians in d dimensions, including non-Hermitean -symmetric Hamiltonians. Hamiltonians are constructed using time-dependent unitary spatial transformations comprising dilatations, translations and rotations and solutions are found in several forms: as eigenfunctions of a quadratic invariant, as coherent state eigenfunctions of boson operators, as plane wave solutions from which the general solution is obtained as an integral transform by means of the Fourier transform, and as distributional solutions for which the initial wavefunction is the Dirac δ-function. For the isotropic harmonic oscillator in d dimensions radial solutions are found which extend known results for d = 1, including Barut–Girardello and Perelomov coherent states (i.e., vector coherent states), which are shown to be related to eigenfunctions of the quadratic invariant by the ζ-transformation. This transformation, which leaves the Ermakov equation invariant, implements SU(1, 1) transformations on linear dynamical invariants. coherent states are derived also for the time-dependent linear potential. Exact solutions are found for Hamiltonians with electromagnetic interactions in which the time-dependent magnetic and electric fields are not necessarily spatially uniform. As an example, it is shown how to find exact solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation for the Dirac magnetic monopole in the presence of time-dependent magnetic and electric fields of a specified form.},

The system is analyzed using the solutions of the time-dependent Schrodinger's equation, which are obtained by solving the corresponding nonlinear Ermakov equations. The entanglement entropies exhibit a multi-oscillatory behaviour, where the number of dynamically generated time scales increases with N. The harmonic chains exhibit entanglement revival and for larger values of N (> 10), we find near-critical logarithmic scaling for the entanglement entropy, which is modulated by a time-dependent factor. The N = 2 case is equivalent to the two-site Bose-Hubbard model in the tunneling regime, which is amenable to empirical realization in cold-atom systems.},

Our test does not require a direct comparison between the approaches and thus avoids the issue of choice of gates, basis, etc. The proposed testing procedure employs the information-theoretic measures Loschmidt echo and Fidelity; the idea is to investigate the sensitivity of the complexity (derived from the different approaches) to the evolution of states. We discover that only circuit complexity obtained directly from the wave function is sensitive to time evolution, leaving us to claim that it surpasses the other approaches. We also demonstrate that circuit complexity displays a universal behaviour -- the complexity is proportional to the number of distinct Hamiltonian evolutions that act on a reference state. Due to this fact, for a given number of Hamiltonians, we can always find the combination of states that provides the maximum complexity; consequently, other combinations involving a smaller number of evolutions will have less than maximum complexity and, hence, will have resources. Finally, we explore the evolution of complexity in non-local theories; we demonstrate the growth of complexity is sustained over a longer period of time as compared to a local theory.},

First, we show that for the time-dependent harmonic oscillator, as well as for the charged particle in certain time-varying electromagnetic fields, the increase of the entropy and dynamics of the Fisher information can be directly described and related. To illustrate these results, we have considered several examples for which all the relations take the elementary form. Moreover, we show that the integrals of (geodesic) motion associated with some conformal Killing vectors lead to the Ermakov-Lewis invariants for the considered electromagnetic fields. Next, we explicitly work out the dynamics of the entanglement entropy of the oscillators coupled by a continuous time-dependent parameter as well as we analyse some aspects of quantum-classical transition (in particular decoherence). Finally, we study in some detail the behaviour of quantum quenches (in the presence of the critical points) for the case of mutually non-interacting non-relativistic fermions in a harmonic trap.},

Such state can be translated to the phase space picture to determine the Wigner distribution. We show that its Gaussian matrix 𝔾(t) can be used to directly cast the covariance matrix σ(t). To quantify the mixedness and entanglement of the state, one uses respectively linear and von Neumann entropies for three cases: fully symmetric, bi-symmetric and fully nonsymmetric. Then we determine the coherence, tripartite entanglement and local uncertainties and derive their dynamics. We show that the dynamics of all quantum information quantities are driven by the Ermakov modes. Finally, we use an homodyne detection to redistribute both resources of entanglement and coherence.},

We prove a quantum version of this result valid for bosonic systems with unstable quadratic Hamiltonian. The derivation takes into account the case of time-dependent Hamiltonians with Floquet instabilities. We show that the entanglement entropy SA of a Gaussian state grows linearly for large times in unstable systems, with a rate ΛA ≤ hKS determined by the Lyapunov exponents and the choice of the subsystem A. We apply our results to the analysis of entanglement production in unstable quadratic potentials and due to periodic quantum quenches in many-body quantum systems. Our results are relevant for quantum field theory, for which we present three applications: a scalar field in a symmetry-breaking potential, parametric resonance during post-inflationary reheating and cosmological perturbations during inflation. Finally, we conjecture that the same rate ΛA appears in the entanglement growth of chaotic quantum systems prepared in a semiclassical state.},

  abstract = {Intuition tells us that an isolated physical system subjected to a sudden change (i.e., quenching) will evolve in a way that maximizes its entropy. If the system is in a pure, zero-entropy quantum state, it is expected to remain so even after quenching. How do we then reconcile statistical mechanics with quantum laws? To address this question, Kaufman et al. used their quantum microscope to study strings of six rubidium atoms confined in the wells of an optical lattice (see the Perspective by Polkovnikov and Sels). When tunneling along the strings was suddenly switched on, the strings as a whole remained in a pure state, but smaller subsets of two or three atoms conformed to a thermal distribution. The force driving the thermalization was quantum entanglement. Science, this issue p. 794; see also p. 752 Single-site microscopy of strings of rubidium atoms in an optical lattice shows thermalization on a local scale. Statistical mechanics relies on the maximization of entropy in a system at thermal equilibrium. However, an isolated quantum many-body system initialized in a pure state remains pure during Schrödinger evolution, and in this sense it has static, zero entropy. We experimentally studied the emergence of statistical mechanics in a quantum state and observed the fundamental role of quantum entanglement in facilitating this emergence. Microscopy of an evolving quantum system indicates that the full quantum state remains pure, whereas thermalization occurs on a local scale. We directly measured entanglement entropy, which assumes the role of the thermal entropy in thermalization. The entanglement creates local entropy that validates the use of statistical physics for local observables. Our measurements are consistent with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis.},

  abstract = {The quantum theory of a harmonic oscillator with a time dependent frequency arises in several important physical problems, especially in the study of quantum field theory in an external background. While the mathematics of this system is straightforward, several conceptual issues arise in such a study. We present a general formalism to address some of the conceptual issues like the emergence of classicality, definition of particle content, back reaction etc. In particular, we parameterize the wave function in terms of a complex number (which we call excitation parameter) and express all physically relevant quantities in terms it. Many of the notions--like those of particle number density, effective Lagrangian etc., which are usually defined using asymptotic in-out states--are generalized as time-dependent concepts and we show that these generalized definitions lead to useful and reasonable results. Having developed the general formalism we apply it to several examples. Exact analytic expressions are found for a particular toy model and approximate analytic solutions are obtained in the extreme cases of adiabatic and highly non-adiabatic evolution. We then work out the exact results numerically for a variety of models and compare them with the analytic results and approximations. The formalism is useful in addressing the question of emergence of classicality of the quantum state, its relation to particle production and to clarify several conceptual issues related to this. In Paper II which is a sequel to this, the formalism will be applied to analyze the corresponding issues in the context of quantum field theory in background cosmological models and electric fields.},

  abstract = {A harmonic oscillator with time-dependent mass m(t) and a time-dependent (squared) frequency $$\omega ^2(t)$$occurs in the modelling of several physical systems. It is generally believed that systems, with $$m(t)>0$$and $$\omega ^2(t)>0$$(normal oscillator) are stable while systems with $$m(t)>0$$and $$\omega ^2(t)<0$$(inverted oscillator) are unstable. We show that it is possible to represent the same physical system either as a normal oscillator or as an inverted oscillator by redefinition of dynamical variables. While we expect the physics to be invariant under such redefinitions, it is not obvious how this invariance actually comes about. We study the relation between these two, normal and inverted, representations of an oscillator in detail both in Heisenberg and Schrödinger pictures to clarify several conceptual and technical issues. The situation becomes more involved when the oscillator is coupled to another (semi)classical degree of freedom C(t) and we want to study the back-reaction of the quantum system q(t) on C(t), in the semi-classical approximation. We provide a simple prescription for the back-reaction based on energy conservation and study that the dynamics of the full system in both normal and the inverted oscillator representation. The physics again remains invariant but there are some extra subtleties which we clarify. The implications of these results for quantum field theory in cosmological backgrounds are discussed briefly in an appendix.},

  abstract = {A mirror in vacuum is submitted to a radiation pressure exerted by scattered fields. It is known that the resulting mean force is zero for a motionless mirror, but not for a mirror moving with a non-uniform acceleration. The authors show here that this force results from a motional modification of the field scattering while being associated with the fluctuations of the radiation pressure on a motionless mirror. They consider the case of a scalar field in a two-dimensional spacetime and characterize the scattering upon the mirror by frequency dependent transmissivity and reflectivity functions obeying unitarity, causality and high frequency transparency conditions. They derive causal expressions for dissipation and fluctuations and exhibit their relation for any stationary input. They recover the known damping force at the limit of a perfect mirror in vacuum. Finally, they interpret the force as a mechanical signature of the squeezing effect associated with the mirror's motion.},

In the dynamical Casimir effect, accelerating neutral bodies in free space give rise to the emission of real photons while experiencing a damping force which plays the role of a radiation reaction force. Analog models where non-stationary conditions for the electromagnetic field simulate the presence of moving plates are currently under experimental investigation. A dissipative force might also appear in the case of uniform relative motion between two bodies, thus leading to a new kind of friction mechanism without mechanical contact. In this paper, we review recent advances on the dynamical Casimir and non-contact friction effects, highlighting their common physical origin.},

A conceptual problem arises due to the fact that the primordial fluctuations are quantum, while the standard scenario of structure formation deals with classical fluctuations. In this essay we present a concise summary of the physics describing the quantum-to-classical transition. We first discuss the observational indistinguishability between classical and quantum correlation functions in the closed system approach (pragmatic view). We then present the open system approach with environment-induced decoherence. We finally discuss the question of the fluctuations' entropy for which, in principle, the concrete mechanism leading to decoherence possesses observational relevance.},

This equivalence and the decoherence are achieved once the exponentially small (in terms of the squeezing parameter ) decaying mode is neglected. In the quasi-classical limit , the perturbation mode functions can be made real by a time-independent phase rotation; this is shown to be equivalent to a fixed relation between squeezing angle and phase for all modes in the squeezed-state formalism. Though the present state of the gravitational wave background is not a squeezed quantum state in the strict sense and the squeezing parameters loose their direct meaning due to interaction with the environment and other processes, the standard predictions for the rms values of the perturbations generated during inflation are not affected by these mechanisms (at least, for scales of interest in cosmological applications). This stochastic background still occupies a small part of phase space.},

We examine the effects of the interactions between our system and the environment. This interaction causes the long-wavelength modes to decohere for realistic values of the coupling and we conclude that interactions due to backreaction are more than sufficient to decohere the bulk of the system within 60 e-foldings of inflation.

Open systems are those that allow information to be exchanged between the degrees of freedom of interest and those that are integrated out, such as would be appropriate for particles moving through a fluid. Strictly speaking they cannot in general be described by an effective lagrangian; rather the appropriate ‘low-energy’ limit is instead a Lindblad equation describing the time-evolution of the density matrix of the slow degrees of freedom. We derive the equation relevant to super-Hubble modes of quantum fields in de Sitter (and near-de Sitter) spacetimes and derive two of its implications. We show that the evolution of the diagonal density-matrix elements quickly approach the Fokker-Planck equation of Starobinsky’s stochastic inflationary picture. This allows us both to identify the leading corrections and provide an alternative first-principles derivation of this picture’s stochastic noise and drift. (As applications we show that the noise for massless fields is independent of the details of the window function used, and also compute how the noise changes for systems with a sub-luminal speed of sound, cs< 1.) We then argue that the presence of interactions drive the off-diagonal density-matrix elements to zero in the field},

Specifically, we calculate the first-order corrections to the primordial gravitational wave spectrum due to (cubic) tensor interactions alone. We show that our results match expectations from standard loop corrections only in the strict Markovian limit, and therefore, establish a systematic way to relax this approximation in the future, as is generally necessary for gravitational systems.},

  abstract  = {Although the paradigm of inflation has been extensively studied to demonstrate how macroscopic inhomogeneities in our Universe originate from quantum fluctuations, most of the established literature ignores the crucial role that entanglement between the modes of the fluctuating field plays in its observable predictions. In this paper, we import techniques from quantum information theory to reveal hitherto undiscovered predictions for inflation which, in turn, signals how quantum entanglement across cosmological scales can affect large scale structure. Our key insight is that observable long-wavelength modes must be part of an open quantum system, so that the quantum fluctuations can decohere in the presence of an environment of short-wavelength modes. By assuming the simplest model of single-field inflation, and considering the leading order interaction term from the gravitational action, we derive a universal lower bound on the observable effect of such inescapable entanglement. Although this signal is too weak for direct detection in the foreseeable future, we discuss the importance of its theoretical implications.},

  abstract = {The transition from quantum to semiclassical behaviour and loss of quantum coherence for inhomogeneous perturbations generated from a non-vacuum initial state in the early Universe is considered in the Heisenberg and the Schrödinger representations, as well as using the Wigner function. We show explicitly that these three approaches lead to the same prediction in the limit of large squeezing (i.e. when the squeezing parameter |rk| → ∞): each two-modes quantum state (k, − k) of these perturbations is equivalent to a classical perturbation that has a stochastic amplitude, obeying a non-Gaussian statistics which depends on the initial state, and that belongs to the quasi-isotropic mode (i.e. it possesses a fixed phase). The Wigner function is not everywhere positive for any finite rk, hence its interpretation as a classical distribution function in phase space is impossible without some coarse graining procedure. However, this does not affect the transition to semiclassical behaviour since the Wigner function becomes concentrated near a classical trajectory in phase space when |rk| → ∞ even without coarse graining. Deviations of the statistics of the perturbations in real space from a Gaussian one lie below the cosmic variance level for the N-particles initial states with N = N(|k|) but may be observable for other initial states without statistical isotropy or with correlations between different k modes. As a way to look for this effect, it is proposed to measure the kurtosis of the angular fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background temperature.},

This question is important because our universe seems to have done just that! We construct an explicit, simple, example of such a system with just two degrees of freedom, of which one achieves ‘spontaneous classicalization’. It starts from a quantum state and under the usual Hamiltonian evolution, becomes more and more classical (in a well-defined manner in terms of the Wigner function) as time progresses. This is achieved without the usual procedures of integrating out a large number of environmental degrees of freedom or conventional decoherence. We consider different ranges of parameter space and identify the conditions under which spontaneous classicalization occurs in our model. The mutual interaction between the sub-systems of a larger system can indeed drive some of the subsystems to a classical configuration, with a phase space trajectory of evolution. We also argue that the results of our toy model may well be general characteristics of certain class of interacting systems. Several implications are discussed.},

  abstract = {Canonical transformations are ubiquitous in Hamiltonian mechanics, since they not only describe the fundamental invariance of the theory under phase-space reparameterisations, but also generate the dynamics of the system. In the first part of this work we study the symplectic structure associated with linear canonical transformations. After reviewing salient mathematical properties of the symplectic group in a pedagogical way, we introduce the squeezing formalism, and show how any linear dynamics can be cast in terms of an invariant representation. In the second part, we apply these results to the case of cosmological perturbations, and focus on scalar field fluctuations during inflation. We show that different canonical variables select out different vacuum states, and that this leaves an ambiguity in observational predictions if initial conditions are set at a finite time in the past. We also discuss how the effectiveness of the quantum-to-classical transition of cosmological perturbations depends on the set of canonical variables used to describe them.},

  abstract  = {There seems to exist agreement about the fact that inflation squeezes the quantum state of cosmological perturbations and entangles modes with wavenumbers k⟶ and -k⟶. Paradoxically, this result has been used to justify both the classicality as well as the quantumness of the primordial perturbations at the end of inflation.  We reexamine this question and point out that the definition of two-mode squeezing of the modes k⟶ and -k⟶ used in previous work rests on choices that are only justified for systems with time-independent Hamiltonians and finitely many degrees of freedom. We argue that for quantum fields propagating on generic time-dependent Friedmann-Lemaître-Robertson-Walker backgrounds, the notion of squeezed states is subject to ambiguities, which go hand in hand with the ambiguity in the definition of particles. In other words, we argue that the question “does the cosmic expansion squeeze and entangle modes with wavenumbers k⟶ and -k⟶?” contains the same ambiguity as the question “does the cosmic expansion create particles?”.  When additional symmetries are present, like in the (quasi) de Sitter-like spacetimes used in inflationary models, one can resolve the ambiguities, and we find that the answer to the question in the title turns out to be in the negative.  We further argue that this fact does not make the state of cosmological perturbations any less quantum, at least when deviations from Gaussianity can be neglected.},

The parametric variation in the unambiguous contribution of the circuit complexity for an arbitrary number of oscillators has been studied with respect to the dimensionless parameter (t/&delta;t).

In this work, we show that the area law is violated in two spatial dimensional model Hamiltonian having dynamical critical exponent z = 3. The model physically corresponds to next-to-next-to-next nearest neighbour coupling terms on a lattice. The result reported here is the first of its kind of violation of area law in Bosonic systems in higher dimensions and signals the evidence of a quantum phase transition. We provide evidence for quantum phase transition both numerically and analytically using quantum Information tools like entanglement spectra, quantum fidelity, and gap in the energy spectra. We identify the cause for this transition due to the accumulation of large number of angular zero modes around the critical point which catalyses the change in the ground state wave function due to the next-to-next-to-next nearest neighbor coupling. Lastly, using Hubbard-Stratanovich transformation, we show that the effective Bosonic Hamiltonian can be obtained from an interacting fermionic theory and provide possible implications for condensed matter systems.},

  abstract  = {We compute the entanglement entropy, mutual information and quantum discord of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) fluctuations in real space. To that end, we first show that measurements of these fluctuations at two distinct spatial locations can be described by a bipartite, continuous Gaussian system. This leads to explicit formulas for the mutual information and the quantum discord in terms of the Fourier-space power spectra of the curvature perturbation. We then find that quantum entanglement, that builds up in Fourier space between opposite wave momenta as an effect of quantum squeezing, is transferred to real space. In particular, both the mutual information and quantum discord, which decay as the fourth power of the distance between the two measurements in flat space time, asymptotes a constant in cosmological backgrounds. At the scales probed in the CMB however, they are highly suppressed, while they can reach order-one values at much smaller scales, where primordial black holes could have formed.},

  abstract  = {Despite being created through a fundamentally quantum-mechanical process, cosmological structures have not yet revealed any sign of genuine quantum correlations. Among the obstructions to the direct detection of quantum signatures in cosmology, environmental-induced decoherence is arguably one of the most inevitable. Yet, we discover a mechanism of quantum recoherence for the adiabatic perturbations when they couple to an entropic sector. After a transient phase of decoherence, a turning point is reached, recoherence proceeds and adiabatic perturbations exhibit a large amount of self-coherence at late-time. This result is also understood by means of a non-Markovian master equation, which reduces to Wilsonian effective-field theory in the unitary limit. This allows us to critically assess the validity of open-quantum-system methods in cosmology and to highlight that re(de)coherence from linear interactions has no flat-space analogue.},

  abstract  = {We compute the rate with which super-Hubble cosmological fluctuations are decohered during inflation, by their gravitational interactions with unobserved shorter-wavelength scalar and tensor modes. We do so using Open Effective Field Theory methods, that remain under control at the late times of observational interest, contrary to perturbative calculations. Our result is minimal in the sense that it only incorporates the self-interactions predicted by General Relativity in single-clock models (additional interaction channels should only speed up decoherence). We find that decoherence is both suppressed by the first slow-roll parameter and by the energy density during inflation in Planckian units, but that it is enhanced by the volume comprised within the scale of interest, in Hubble units. This implies that, for the scales probed in the Cosmic Microwave Background, decoherence is effective as soon as inflation proceeds above ∼ 5 × 109 GeV. Alternatively, if inflation proceeds at GUT scale decoherence is incomplete only for the scales crossing out the Hubble radius in the last ∼ 13  e-folds of inflation. We also compute how short-wavelength scalar modes decohere primordial tensor perturbations, finding a faster rate unsuppressed by slow-roll parameters. Identifying the parametric dependence of decoherence, and the rate at which it proceeds, helps suggest ways to look for quantum effects.},

  abstract = {The environment – external or internal degrees of freedom coupled to the system – can, in effect, monitor some of its observables. As a result, the eigenstates of these observables decohere and behave like classical states: Continuous destruction of superpositions leads to environment-induced superselection (einselection). Here I investigate it in the context of quantum chaos (i.e., quantum dynamics of systems which are classically chaotic). I show that the evolution of a chaotic macroscopic (but, ultimately, quantum) system is not just difficult to predict (requiring an accuracy exponentially increasing with time) but quickly ceases to be deterministic in principle as a result of the Heisenberg indeterminacy (which limits the resolution available in the initial conditions). This happens after a time tℏ which is only logarithmic in the Planck constant. A definitely macroscopic (if somewhat outrageous) example is afforded by various components of the solar system which are chaotic, with the Lyapunov timescales ranging from a bit more than a month (Hyperion) to millions of years (planetary system as a whole). On the timescale tℏ the initial minimum uncertainty wavepackets corresponding to celestial bodies would be smeared over distances of the order of radii of their orbits into “Schrödinger cat – like” states, and the concept of a trajectory would cease to apply. In reality, such paradoxical states are eliminated by decoherence which helps restore quantum-classical correspondence. The price for the recovery of classicality is the loss of predictability: In the classical limit (associated with effective decoherence, and not just with the smallness of ℏ) the rate of increase of the von Neumann entropy of the decohering system is independent of the strength of the coupling to the environment, and equal to the sum of the positive Lyapunov exponents. Algorithmic aspects of entropy production are briefly explored to illustrate the effect of decoherence from the point of view of the observer. We show that “decoherence strikes twice”, introducing unpredictability into the system and extracting quantum coherence from the observers memory, where it enters as a price for the classicality of his records.},
