  "abstract": "Quantum computers are increasing in size and quality, but are still very noisy. Error mitigation extends the size of the quantum circuits that noisy devices can meaningfully execute. However, state-of-the-art error mitigation methods are hard to implement and the limited qubit connectivity in superconducting qubit devices restricts most applications to the hardware's native topology. Here we show a quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) on non-planar random regular graphs with up to 40 nodes enabled by a machine learning-based error mitigation. We use a swap network with careful decision-variable-to-qubit mapping and a feed-forward neural network to demonstrate optimization of a depth-two QAOA on up to 40 qubits. We observe a meaningful parameter optimization for the largest graph which requires running quantum circuits with 958 two-qubit gates. Our work emphasizes the need to mitigate samples, and not only expectation values, in quantum approximate optimization. These results are a step towards executing quantum approximate optimization at a scale that is not classically simulable. Reaching such system sizes is key to properly understanding the true potential of heuristic algorithms like QAOA.",
