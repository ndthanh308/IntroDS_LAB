\begin{proposition}\label{prop:sixschwartz}
For the in-place realization of each of linear operators
arising from the sparsification of any bilinear matrix
multiplication algorithm using only $7$ multiplications,
and for the restoration of the initial states of their input,
at least $6$ operations are needed.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The alternate basis method of~\cite{Karstadt:JACM:2020:MMfaster},
consist in sparsifying the matrices of~\cref{eq:alphabetamu}, via
right multiplication by $4{\times}4$ invertible matrices.
The sparsest obtained matrices are given in
\begin{equation}\label{eq:schwartz}
\begin{smatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\\
 0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\\
 0 & 1 & 0 & 0
\\
 1 & 0 & 0 & 0
\\
 0 & 1 & -1 & 0
\\
 -1 & 1 & 0 & 0
\\
 0 & -1 & 0 & 1
\end{smatrix},
\\
\begin{smatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\\
 0 & 0 & 1 & 0
\\
 0 & 1 & 0 & 0
\\
 1 & 0 & 0 & 0
\\
 0 & -1 & 0 & 1
\\
 0 & 1 & -1 & 0
\\
 -1 & 1 & 0 & 0
\end{smatrix},
\\
\begin{smatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 0 & 0
\\
 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 1
\\
 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\\
 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & -1 & 0
\end{smatrix}
\end{equation}

We then follow the same line of reasoning as in~\cref{prop:six}, where
we mostly need to adapt~\cref{lem:nocannorzero}.
W.l.o.g, we consider a $4{\times}4$ transformation $M$ of the left
matrix in~\cref{eq:schwartz}.

If the resulting product matrix has only $3$ rows that are multiple of
a canonical vector, then $6$ multiplications are minimal
by~\cref{prop:six}.
The only other possibility is thus, as in~\cref{eq:schwartz}, that it
contains exactly $4$ rows that are multiples of a canonical vector.

Now, each one of the four columns of the resulting product has the form:\\
\[\Transpose{\begin{bmatrix}a&b&c&d&c-b&c-d&a-c\end{bmatrix}}.\]
Such a column can never be a zero-column, nor a multiple of a
canonical vector.

Therefore, as in~\cref{prop:six} all $4$ variables must appear in the
$3$ rows that are not canonical and at most one variable can be
modified.
So again at least $3$ operations are of the form
$a_1\pe\lambda_i{a_i}$ for $i=2,3,4$ and some constants $\lambda_i$.
But then again at least $3$ operations are required to put back $a_1$
in its initial state and no in-place
algorithm can use strictly less than $6$ operations.
\end{proof}
