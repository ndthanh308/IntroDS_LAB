  "abstract": "Introduced in the late 90s, the passport option gives its holder the right to trade in a market and receive any positive gain in the resulting traded account at maturity. Pricing the option amounts to solving a stochastic control problem that for $d>1$ risky assets remains an open problem. Even in a correlated Black-Scholes (BS) market with $d=2$ risky assets, no optimal trading strategy has been derived in closed form. In this paper, we derive a discrete-time solution for multi-dimensional BS markets with uncorrelated assets. Moreover, inspired by the success of deep reinforcement learning in, e.g., board games, we propose two machine learning-powered approaches to pricing general options on a portfolio value in general markets. These approaches prove to be successful for pricing the passport option in one-dimensional and multi-dimensional uncorrelated BS markets.",
