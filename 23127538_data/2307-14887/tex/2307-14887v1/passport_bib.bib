  year        = {2019},
  abstract    = {Today, various forms of neural networks are trained to perform approximation tasks in many fields. However, the estimates obtained are not fully understood on function space. Empirical results suggest that typical training algorithms favor regularized solutions. These observations motivate us to analyze properties of the neural networks found by gradient descent initialized close to zero, that is frequently employed to perform the training task. As a starting point, we consider one dimensional (shallow) ReLU neural networks in which weights are chosen randomly and only the terminal layer is trained. First, we rigorously show that for such networks ridge regularized regression corresponds in function space to regularizing the estimate's second derivative for fairly general loss functionals. For least squares regression, we show that the trained network converges to the smooth spline interpolation of the training data as the number of hidden nodes tends to infinity. Moreover, we derive a correspondence between the early stopped gradient descent and the smoothing spline regression. Our analysis might give valuable insight on the properties of the solutions obtained using gradient descent methods in general settings.},

In this article, we utilize techniques inspired by reinforcement learning in order to optimize the operation plans of underground natural gas storage facilities. We provide a theoretical framework and assess the performance of the proposed method numerically in comparison to a state-of-the-art least-squares Monte-Carlo approach. Due to the inherent intricacy originating from the high-dimensional forward market as well as the numerous constraints and frictions, the optimization exercise can hardly be tackled by means of traditional techniques.},

Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) and neural networks are key to this approach. Powerful open source optimization libraries allow for efficient implementations of this algorithm making it viable in high-dimensional structures. The free-boundary problems related to American and Bermudan options showcase both the power and the potential difficulties that specific applications may face. The impact of the size of the training data is studied in a simplified Merton type problem. The classical option hedging problem exemplifies the need of market generators or large number of simulations.},
