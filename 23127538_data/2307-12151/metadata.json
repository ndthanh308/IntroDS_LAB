  "abstract": "Maintaining power system stability is becoming more and more challenging due to the ever-increasing inverter-interfaced renewable penetration in power systems. To ensure system stability during system operation and to provide appropriate incentives in the future market-based stability maintenance framework, it is essential to develop a comprehensive set of power system stability constraints which can be incorporated into system operation, market design and planning problems. In this paper, different system stability issues, including synchronization, voltage and frequency stability, are investigated and the corresponding stability conditions are analytically formulated as system operation constraints. A unified framework is further proposed to represent the stability constraints in a general form and enables effective reformulation of the impedance-based stability metrics. All the constraints are converted into linear or Second-Order-Cone (SOC) form, which can be readily implemented in any optimisation-based applications, such as system scheduling, planning and market design, thus providing significant value for multiple system stability enhancement and studies.",
