  "abstract": "We propose a machine learning approach to the optimal control of multiclass fluid queueing networks (MFQNETs) that provides explicit and insightful control policies. We prove that a threshold type optimal policy exists for MFQNET control problems, where the threshold curves are hyperplanes passing through the origin. We use Optimal Classification Trees with hyperplane splits (OCT-H) to learn an optimal control policy for MFQNETs. We use numerical solutions of MFQNET control problems as a training set and apply OCT-H to learn explicit control policies. We report experimental results with up to 33 servers and 99 classes that demonstrate that the learned policies achieve 100\\% accuracy on the test set. While the offline training of OCT-H can take days in large networks, the online application takes milliseconds.",
