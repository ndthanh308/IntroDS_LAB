    abstract = { This paper discusses a class of continuous linear programs posed in a function space called separated continuous linear programs (SCLP). A dual linear program and a corresponding discrete approximation are introduced followed by a discussion of their properties. The discrete approximation gives rise to an improvement step which is constructed from any given feasible (nonoptimal) solution for SCLP. A strong duality result follows from this. There are a variety of possible implementations of an algorithm for solving SCLP problems using this improvement step. Finally some computational results are given from one possible implementation. }
