  "abstract": "We study finding and listing $k$-cliques in a graph, for constant $k\\geq 3$, a fundamental problem of both theoretical and practical importance.\n  Our main contribution is a new output-sensitive algorithm for listing $k$-cliques in graphs, for arbitrary $k\\geq 3$, coupled with lower bounds based on standard fine-grained assumptions, showing that our algorithm's running time is tight. Previously, the only known conditionally optimal output-sensitive algorithms were for the case of $3$-cliques by Björklund, Pagh, Vassilevska W. and Zwick [ICALP'14].\n  Typical inputs to subgraph isomorphism or listing problems are measured by the number of nodes $n$ or the number of edges $m$. Our framework is very general in that it gives $k$-clique listing algorithms whose running times are measured in terms of the number of $\\ell$-cliques $Δ_\\ell$ in the graph for any $1\\leq \\ell<k$. This generalizes the typical parameterization in terms of $n$ (the number of $1$-cliques) and $m$ (the number of $2$-cliques).\n  If the matrix multiplication exponent $ω$ is $2$, and if the size of the output, $Δ_k$, is sufficiently large, then for every $\\ell<k$, the running time of our algorithm for listing $k$-cliques is $$\\tilde{O}\\left(Δ_\\ell^{\\frac{2}{\\ell (k - \\ell)}}Δ_k^{1-\\frac{2}{k(k-\\ell)}}\\right).$$ For sufficiently large $Δ_k$, we prove that this runtime is in fact {\\em optimal} for all $1 \\leq \\ell < k$ under the Exact $k$-Clique hypothesis.\n  In the special cases of $k = 4$ and $5$, our algorithm in terms of $n$ is conditionally optimal for all values of $Δ_k$ if $ω= 2$. Moreover, our framework is powerful enough to provide an improvement upon the 19-year old runtimes for $4$ and $5$-clique detection in $m$-edge graphs, as a function of $m$ [Eisenbrand and Grandoni, TCS'04].",
