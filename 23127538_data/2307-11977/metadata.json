  "abstract": "We demonstrate a novel single molecule technique that is compatible with high precision measurements and obtain the spectrum of two molecular ion species. While the current result yields modest spectral resolution due to a broad light source, we expect the method to ultimately provide resolution comparable to quantum logic methods with significantly less stringent requirements. Adaptations of this technique will prove useful in a wide range of precision spectroscopy arenas including the search for parity violating effects in chiral molecules.",
