  "abstract": "We construct local fermionic Hamiltonians with no low-energy trivial states (NLTS), providing a fermionic counterpart to the NLTS theorem. Distinctly from the qubit case, we define trivial states via finite-depth $\\textit{fermionic}$ quantum circuits. We furthermore allow free access to Gaussian fermionic operations, provided they involve at most $O(n)$ ancillary fermions. The desired fermionic Hamiltonian can be constructed using any qubit Hamiltonian which itself has the NLTS property via well-spread distributions over bitstrings, such as the construction in [Anshu, Breuckmann, Nirkhe, STOC 2023]. We define a fermionic analogue of the class quantum PCP and discuss its relation with the qubit version.",
