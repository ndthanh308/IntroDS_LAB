  "abstract": "In this article, we consider a generalization of the conjugate Hardy $H^2$ spaces, and give some properties of the minimal norm of the generalization and some relations between the norm of the generalization and the minimal $L^2$ integrals. As applications, we give some monotonicity results for the conjugate Hardy $H^2$ kernels and the Bergman kernels on planar regions, and some relations between the conjugate Hardy $H^2$ kernels and the Bergman kernels on planar regions.",
