               walked on it as they fell into step with the bridge's vibrations

               central theoretical questions about physiological rhythms.
               Topics discussed include: How are rhythms generated? How do they
               start and stop? What are the effects of perturbation of the
               rhythms? How are oscillations organized in space? Leon Glass and

               physicians, physical scientists, and mathematicians, but the
               work assumes no knowledge of advanced mathematics. Variation of
               rhythms outside normal limits, or appearance of new rhythms
               where none existed previously, are associated with disease. One
               of the most interesting features of the book is that it makes a
               start at explaining ``dynamical diseases'' that are not the
               result of infection by pathogens but that stem from
               abnormalities in the timing of essential functions. From Clocks

              are coupled limit-cycle oscillators. Particular emphasis is
              placed on the remarkable structural similarity existing between

  abstract = "In 1665, Huygens observed that two identical pendulum clocks,
              weakly coupled through a heavy beam, soon synchronized with the
              same period and amplitude but with the two pendula swinging in
              opposite directions. This behaviour is now called anti-phase
              synchronization. This paper presents an analysis of the behaviour
              of a large class of coupled identical oscillators, including
              Huygens' clocks, using methods of equivariant bifurcation theory.
              The equivariant normal form for such systems is developed and the
              possible solutions are characterized. The transformation of the
              physical system parameters to the normal form parameters is given
              explicitly and applied to the physical values appropriate for
              Huygens' clocks, and to those of more recent studies. It is shown
              that Huygens' physical system could only exhibit anti-phase
              motion, explaining why Huygens observed exclusively this. By
              contrast, some more recent researchers have observed in-phase or
              other more complicated motion in their own experimental systems.
              Here, it is explained which physical characteristics of these
              systems allow for the existence of these other types of stable
              solutions. The present analysis not only accounts for these
              previously observed solutions in a unified framework, but also
              introduces behaviour not classified by other authors, such as a

  abstract  = "The Kuramoto model is a system of ordinary differential
               equations for describing synchronization phenomena defined as
               coupled phase oscillators. In this paper, a bifurcation
               structure of the infinite-dimensional Kuramoto model is
               investigated. A purpose here is to prove the bifurcation diagram
               of the model conjectured by Kuramoto in 1984; if the coupling
               strength , a non-trivial stable solution, which corresponds to
               the synchronization, bifurcates from the de-synchronous state.
               One of the difficulties in proving the conjecture is that a
               certain non-selfadjoint linear operator, which defines a linear
               part of the Kuramoto model, has the continuous spectrum on the
               imaginary axis. Hence, the standard spectral theory is not
               applicable to prove a bifurcation as well as the asymptotic
               stability of the steady state. In this paper, the spectral
               theory on a space of generalized functions is developed with the
               aid of a rigged Hilbert space to avoid the continuous spectrum
               on the imaginary axis. Although the linear operator has an
               unbounded continuous spectrum on a Hilbert space, it is shown
               that it admits a spectral decomposition consisting of a
               countable number of eigenfunctions on a space of generalized
               functions. The semigroup generated by the linear operator will
               be estimated with the aid of the spectral theory on a rigged
               Hilbert space to prove the linear stability of the steady state
               of the system. The center manifold theory is also developed on a
               space of generalized functions. It is proved that there exists a
               finite-dimensional center manifold on a space of generalized
               functions, while a center manifold on a Hilbert space is of
               infinite dimension because of the continuous spectrum on the
               imaginary axis. These results are applied to the stability and
               bifurcation theory of the Kuramoto model to obtain a bifurcation

              studies in humans have demonstrated the pivotal role of phase
              synchronization in memory processes. Phase synchronization - here

              typically induces three macroscopic behaviors: synchronization,
              desynchronization, and oscillation quenching. However, analyzing
              all of these transitions within a single theoretical framework is
              difficult, and thus the feedback effect is only partially
              understood in each framework. Herein, we analyze a model of

              which shows all of the typical macroscopic dynamical states.
              Analytical tractability of the model enables us to obtain
              detailed phase diagrams where transitions and bistabilities
              between different macroscopic states are identified.

              classical results by presenting a general framework for
              analytically capturing the critical scaling properties of the
              order parameter at the onset of synchronization. Using a
              self-consistent approach and constructing a characteristic
              function, we identify various phase transitions toward synchrony
              and establish scaling relations describing the asymptotic
              dependence of the order parameter on the coupling strength near
              the critical point. We find that the geometric properties of the
              characteristic function, which depends on the natural frequency

  author    = "Skardal, Per Sebastian and Arenas, Alex",
  abstract  = "Synchronization processes play critical roles in the
               functionality of a wide range of both natural and man-made
               systems. Recent work in physics and neuroscience highlights the
               importance of higher-order interactions between dynamical units,
               i.e., three- and four-way interactions in addition to pairwise
               interactions, and their role in shaping collective behavior.
               Here we show that higher-order interactions between coupled
               phase oscillators, encoded microscopically in a simplicial
               complex, give rise to added nonlinearity in the macroscopic
               system dynamics that induces abrupt synchronization transitions
               via hysteresis and bistability of synchronized and incoherent
               states. Moreover, these higher-order interactions can stabilize
               strongly synchronized states even when the pairwise coupling is
               repulsive. These findings reveal a self-organized phenomenon
               that may be responsible for the rapid switching to
               synchronization in many biological and other systems that
               exhibit synchronization without the need of particular
               correlation mechanisms between the oscillators and the
               topological structure. While first order phase transitions
               between incoherence and synchronization are critical for
               collective behavior in various oscillator system application,
               e.g., the brain and power grids, such transitions typically
               require finely tuned properties. In this work the authors show
               that first order phase transitions and bistability can emerge
               naturally as a consequence of the presence of higher-order
               interactions between oscillators.",

  title     = "Synchronization: a framework for examining emotional climate in
               classes",
  author    = "Eilam, Efrat",
  abstract  = "This conceptual paper stems from a growing body of research
               examining the roles and functions of emotional climate
               (EC)---the collective state of students' shared emotions---in
               classrooms. It suggests that EC in classrooms can be analyzed as
               a synchronization phenomenon. Synchronization is a natural
               phenomenon, in which autonomous objects that produce periodic
               rhythms adjust these rhythms to one another. The purpose of this
               article is thus twofold: to position the concept of EC within
               the broader context of synchronization theory; and to propose a
               new definition for EC that captures synchronization aspects.
               This paper first explains the theory of synchronization. It then
               critically discusses several sociological and biological
               theories regarding emotions, and the implications of these
               theories for teaching and learning. It subsequently delves into
               current conceptualizations of EC, and the descriptors used to
               characterize EC in classrooms. On the backdrop of this
               theoretical review, an argument is developed that humans'
               produced emotions can be viewed as autonomous rhythmic
               oscillators that have the capacity to synchronize with one
               another, and that, consequently, EC can be studied as a form of
               synchronization within an ensemble of oscillators. Finally, a
               new definition of EC is proposed that integrates essential
               synchronization features. Overall, this paper suggests that
               synchronization theory can provide a framework of analysis of EC
               as a holistic phenomenon, not reduced to discrete emotional
               events. This approach may contribute to enhancing explanatory
               and predictive capacities in the study of EC.",

               within the framework of the Kuramoto model, has been a subject
               of intense research over the years. The model comprises
               oscillators with distributed natural frequencies interacting
               through a mean-field coupling, and serves as a paradigm to study
               synchronization. In this review, we put forward a general
               framework in which we discuss in a unified way known results
               with more recent developments obtained for a generalized
               Kuramoto model that includes inertial effects and noise. We
               describe the model from a different perspective, highlighting
               the long-range nature of the interaction between the
               oscillators, and emphasizing the equilibrium and
               out-of-equilibrium aspects of its dynamics from a statistical
               physics point of view. In this review, we first introduce the
               model and discuss both for the noiseless and noisy dynamics and
               for unimodal frequency distributions the synchronization
               transition that occurs in the stationary state. We then
               introduce the generalized model, and analyze its dynamics using
               tools from statistical mechanics. In particular, we discuss its
               synchronization phase diagram for unimodal frequency
               distributions. Next, we describe deviations from the mean-field
               setting of the Kuramoto model. To this end, we consider the
               generalized Kuramoto dynamics on a one-dimensional periodic
               lattice on the sites of which the oscillators reside and
               interact with one another with a coupling that decays as an
               inverse power-law of their separation along the lattice. For two
               specific cases, namely, in the absence of noise and inertia, and
               in the case when the natural frequencies are the same for all
               the oscillators, we discuss how the long-time transition to
               synchrony is governed by the dynamics of the mean-field mode
               (zero Fourier mode) of the spatial distribution of the

abstract = {Entrainment of circadian behavior rhythms by daily exposure to a running wheel was examined in mice under constant darkness. Spontaneous movement was individually monitored for more than 6 mo by a thermal sensor. After establishment of steady-state free running, mice were placed in a different cage equipped with a running-wheel for 3 h once per day at 6 AM. The daily exchange was continued for 80 days. The number of wheel revolutions during exposure to the running wheel was also measured simultaneously with spontaneous movement. In 13 out of 17 mice, circadian behavior rhythm was entrained by daily wheel exposure, showing a period indistinguishable from 24 h. The entrainment occurred in parallel with an increase in spontaneous movement immediately prior to the daily wheel exposure. A similar preexposure increase was observed in only one of four nonentrained mice. The preexposure increase appeared in 19.5 days on average after the start of daily wheel exposure and persisted for 36 days on average after the termination of the exposure schedule. The preexposure increase was detected only when daily wheel exposure came into the activity phase of the circadian behavior rhythm, which was accompanied by an increase in the number of wheel revolutions. These findings indicate that a novel oscillation with a circadian period is induced in mice by daily exposure to a running wheel at a fixed time of day and suggest that the oscillation is involved in the nonphotic entrainment of circadian rhythms in spontaneous movement. {\textcopyright} 2013 the American Physiological Society.},

abstract = {The human circadian system derives from two distinct circadian oscillators that separately regulate circadian rhythms of body temperature and plasma melatonin, and of the sleep-wake cycle. The oscillator for body temperature and melatonin is the central circadian pacemaker, located in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and the oscillator for sleep-wake cycle is another oscillator, located in the brain but outside the SCN. Although bright light is a primary zeitgeber for circadian rhythms, non-photic time cues such as a strict sleep schedule and timed physical exercise act as a non-photic zeitgeber for the sleep-wake cycle under dim light conditions, independent on the SCN circadian pacemaker. Recently, timed physical exercise under bright light has been shown to accelerate re-entrainment of circadian rhythms to an advanced sleep schedule. Physical exercise may enhance the phase-shift of circa-dian rhythm caused by bright light by changing light perception. In the field of sports medicine and exercise science, adjustment of the circadian rhythm is important to enable elite athletes to take a good sleep and enhance exercise performance, especially after inter-continental travel and jet lag.},

@article{mendoza07,
abstract = {In mammals, daily rhythms in behaviour and physiology are driven by a circadian timing system comprised, in a hierarchical way, of a master pacemaker in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus and of peripheral oscillators in most body cells. At the molecular level, in both the SCN and peripheral oscillators, the circadian clock mechanism is built from interconnected feedback loops in gene expression that operate in a cell-autonomous and self-sustained fashion. The SCN clock is mainly entrained by light/dark cycles. By contrast, peripheral oscillators can be strongly affected by daily feeding cycles, which have little effect on the phase of the SCN. However, when feeding schedules are coupled with a caloric restriction, behavioural and physiological circadian rhythms and gene expression in the SCN are shifted and/or entrained to meal-time. Moreover, the reward and motivational value of food can also be a potent synchroniser for the SCN clock. This suggests that energy metabolism and motivational properties of food can influence the clock mechanism of the SCN. Food-related cues may entrain clock genes of the SCN with a direct effect, or be mediated indirectly by another neural or peripheral site. In addition, there may be one or more oscillator sites that would play an integral role as a food-entrained oscillator (FEO), responsible for anticipation of meal-time. The site housing, or the network underlying, this putative FEO is still unknown. The aim of this review is to summarise our current knowledge of the central and peripheral circadian clocks and how they can be entrained by feeding at the physiological and molecular levels. {\textcopyright} 2007 The Authors.

abstract = {Circadian rhythms are generated by the autonomous circadian clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), and clock genes that are present in all tissues. The SCN times these peripheral clocks, as well as behavioral and physiological processes. Recent studies show that frequent violations of conditions set by our biological clock, such as shift work, jet lag, sleep deprivation, or simply eating at the wrong time of the day, may have deleterious effects on health. This infringement, also known as circadian desynchronization, is associated with chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, cancer, and psychiatric disorders. In this review, we will evaluate evidence that these diseases stem from the need of the SCN for peripheral feedback to fine-tune its output and adjust physiological processes to the requirements of the moment. This feedback can vary from neuronal or hormonal signals from the liver to changes in blood pressure. Desynchronization renders the circadian network dysfunctional, resulting in a breakdown of many functions driven by the SCN, disrupting core clock rhythms in the periphery and disorganizing cellular processes that are normally driven by the synchrony between behavior and peripheral signals with neuronal and humoral output of the hypothalamus. Consequently, we propose that the loss of synchrony between the different elements of this circadian network as may occur during shiftwork and jet lag is the reason for the occurrence of health problems.},

abstract = {Effects of timed physical exercise were examined on the reentrainment of sleep-wake cycle and circadian rhythms to an 8-h phase-advanced sleep schedule. Seventeen male adults spent 12 days in a temporal isolation facility with dim light conditions ({\textless}10 lux). The sleep schedule was phase-advanced by 8 h from their habitual sleep times for 4 days, which was followed by a free-run session for 6 days, during which the subjects were deprived of time cues. During the shift schedule, the exercise group (n = 9) performed physical exercise with a bicycle ergometer in the early and middle waking period for 2 h each. The control group (n = 8) sat on a chair at those times. Their sleep-wake cycles were monitored every day by polysomnography and/or weight sensor equipped with a bed. The circadian rhythm in plasma melatonin was measured on the baseline day before phase shift: on the 4th day of shift schedule and the 5th day of free-run. As a result, the sleep-onset on the first day of free-run in the exercise group was significantly phase-advanced from that in the control and from the baseline. On the other hand, the circadian melatonin rhythm was significantly phase-delayed in the both groups, showing internal desynchronization of the circadian rhythms. The sleep-wake cycle resynchronized to the melatonin rhythm by either phase-advance or phase-delay shifts in the free-run session. These findings indicate that the reentrainment of the sleep-wake cycle to a phase-advanced schedule occurs independent of the circadian pacemaker and is accelerated by timed physical exercise.

abstract = {Our previous study demonstrated that physical exercise under dim lights ({\textgreater}10 lux) accelerated reentrainment of the sleep-wake cycle but not the circadian melatonin rhythm to an 8-h phase-advanced sleep schedule, indicating differential effects of physical exercise on the human circadian system. The present study examined the effects of bright light ({\textless}5,000 lux) on exercise-induced acceleration of reentrainment because timed bright lights are known to reset the circadian pacemaker. Fifteen male subjects spent 12 days in temporal isolation. The sleep schedule was advanced from habitual sleep times by 8 h for 4 days, which was followed by a free-run session. In the shift session, bright lights were given during the waking time. Subjects in the exercise group performed 2-h bicycle running twice a day. Subjects in the control kept quiet. As a result, the sleep-wake cycle was fully entrained by the shift schedule in both groups. Bright light may strengthen the resetting potency of the shift schedule. By contrast, the circadian melatonin rhythm was phase-advanced by 6.9 h on average in the exercise group but only by 2.0 h in the control. Thus physical exercise prevented otherwise unavoidable internal desynchronization. Polysomnographical analyses revealed that deterioration of sleep quality by shift schedule was protected by physical exercise under bright lights. These findings indicate differential regulation of sleep-wake cycle and circadian melatonin rhythm by physical exercise in humans. The melatonin rhythm is regulated primarily by bright lights, whereas the sleep-wake cycle is by nonphotic time cues, such as physical exercise and shift schedule. {\textcopyright} 2014 the American Physiological Society.},

	Abstract = {We study the dynamics of two symmetrically coupled populations of identical leaky integrate-and-fire neurons characterized by an excitatory coupling. Upon varying the coupling strength, we find symmetry-breaking transitions that lead to the onset of various chimera states as well as to a new regime, where the two populations are characterized by a different degree of synchronization. Symmetric collective states of increasing dynamical complexity are also observed. The computation of the the finite-amplitude Lyapunov exponent allows us to establish the chaoticity of the (collective) dynamics in a finite region of the phase plane. The further numerical study of the standard Lyapunov spectrum reveals the presence of several positive exponents, indicating that the microscopic dynamics is high-dimensional.},

	Abstract = {Analysis of a chemical model for the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction leads to an analytic form for the dispersion relation for waves travelling in such a medium. It is found that the velocity varies as the hyperbolic tangent of the normalized period. Data analysis suggests that the normalization time is the selected spiral period for the medium. This result agrees with previously published data{,} one-dimensional as well as two-dimensional{,} all of which can be rescaled onto a single dimensionless curve. It thus provides a unifying approach to all waves in this reaction.},
