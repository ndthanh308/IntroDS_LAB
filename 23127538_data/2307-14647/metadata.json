  "abstract": "We compute the Stiefel-Whitney Classes for representations of dihedral groups $D_m$ in terms of character values of order two elements. We also provide criteria to identify representations V which lift to the double covers of the orthogonal group O(V ) and those with non-trivial mod 2 Euler class.",
