\section{Introduction}
Committed individuals (or people) are those who firmly hold their beliefs, values, and preferences, demonstrating unwavering dedication to promoting their convictions. These individuals, found in various domains, both in the physical and digital worlds, can have a profound impact on social dynamics.
Greta Thunberg, who is known for her faithful activism on climate change, has increased public awareness of environmental issues.
Tarana Burke, who started and tirelessly campaigned for the \#MeToo movement, has sparked a global conversation on sexual harassment and assault, leading to significant societal changes.
In the digital realm, social media bots, which are  programmed to constantly express certain opinions, are found to influence or even distort public opinions in the Catalan
independence referendum \cite{stella2018bots}, the Brexit referendum \cite{bessi2016social}, and the US presidential election \cite{vosoughi2018spread}. 

How do committed individuals shape social dynamics?
Under what conditions will they result in significant societal changes? These questions have piqued much interest across multiple disciplines, ranging from statistical physics \cite{galam2012sociophysics,Mobilia2003does,redner2019reality} to social science \cite{cherry2019stubborn,centola2018experimental} and computer science \cite{morris2019norm,kearns2006experimental}.
Specifically within the study of opinion dynamics, the importance of committed individuals has long been acknowledged \cite{noorazar2020recent,galam2012sociophysics,redner2019reality}, with research on this topic dating back to 1990s \cite{galam1991towards}.
More recently, in parallel to opinion dynamics, an emerging line of research examines the role that committed individuals play in social dynamics emerging from coordination games and social dilemma games \cite{centola2018experimental,masuda2012evolution}.
Adopting a game-theoretic framework to model the microscopic interactions between individuals, this line of research assumes that individuals will receive payoffs during interactions and that the payoffs will depend on their joint strategies.
As a result, typically, individuals are incentivized to develop their own strategies towards the direction of increasing their payoffs in interactions, rather than fusing the others' strategies to form their own as in the study of opinion dynamics.


%This survey delves into the above two questions, with a specific focus on social dynamics that emerge from coordination games and social dilemma games.These two types of games offer  mathematical frameworks for understanding coordination problems and cooperation problems, which are widely considered to be fundamental aspects of social dynamics~\cite{castellano2009statistical,young1993evolution,pennisi2005did,jusup2022social}. Coordination games model situations where individuals are incentivized to align their actions. This often leads to multiple equilibria in which players choose matching strategies, and thus raises the problem of equilibrium selection. On the other hand, social dilemma games represent situations where individual benefits may conflict with collective benefits, and cooperation is necessary for the sake of collective well-being. It has been shown that committed individuals can accelerate the emergence of social conventions\cite{sen2007emergence,mukherjee2008norm,hao2013achieving}, overturn the established social conventions \cite{marchant2014destabilising,centola2018experimental}, speed up the resolution of color coordination issues~\cite{shirado2017locally}, address cooperation conundrums ~\cite{PhysRevE.86.011134,masuda2012evolution}, trigger critical mass of cooperation~\cite{cardillo2020critical,he2023impact} and solve vaccination dilemmas~\cite{liu2012impact,fukuda2016effects}. Albeit significant progress along this line of research, so far there lacks a comprehensive survey which summarizes and discusses the progress centering around committed individuals.

This survey delves into the above two questions, with a specific focus on social dynamics that emerge from coordination games and social dilemma games. 
%These two types of games offer mathematical frameworks for understanding coordination problems and cooperation problems, which are widely considered to be fundamental aspects of social dynamics~\cite{castellano2009statistical,young1993evolution,pennisi2005did,jusup2022social}. 
Coordination games involve individuals aligning their strategies to achieve a mutually preferred outcome. Social dilemma games model scenarios where individual benefits may conflict with collective benefits, and cooperation is necessary for collective well-being.
Existing studies have shown that committed individuals play a crucial role in various social dynamics, such as accelerating the emergence of social conventions from pure coordination games\cite{sen2007emergence,mukherjee2008norm,hao2013achieving}, overturning social conventions even if established and socially accepted, expediting the resolution of color coordination games~\cite{shirado2017locally}, 
triggering critical mass effects of cooperation emergence in social dilemmas ~\cite{cardillo2020critical,he2023impact},
promoting and sustaining cooperation
~\cite{PhysRevE.86.011134,masuda2012evolution}, 
and promoting vaccination in social dilemmas coupled with epidemic-spreading processes ~\cite{liu2012impact,fukuda2016effects}.
Albeit significant progress along this line of research, so far there lacks a comprehensive survey which summarizes and discusses the progress centering around committed individuals.

The remainder of this survey will be organized as follows: First, we will summarize the impact of committed individuals on coordination games, focusing on their influence on social conventions and color coordination issues. Following that, we will shift our focus to social dilemma games, first summarizing the influence of committed individuals in one-shot and anonymous games. Next, we will explore their influence in repeated social dilemma games, and finally, we will review their impact in vaccination dilemma games. Lastly, we will conclude with a summary of this survey and provide perspectives for future research in three key areas: conducting human behavior experiments to validate theoretical findings, leveraging advanced large language models as proxies for committed individuals in complex scenarios, and addressing the ethical implications of committed individuals' influence in digital spaces.

It is worth mentioning that the terminology for committed individuals varies across different fields. In opinion dynamics research, they are termed `inflexible agents' or `stubborn agents', while in coordination games, they are `non-learning agents' or `fixed-strategy agents'. In social dilemma games, they are referred to as `zealots' or `stubborn players'. However, these individuals all share a common principle: they consistently adhere to their beliefs or strategies and remain immune to external influence. For clarity, we will use the term `committed individuals' throughout this survey.


\section{Coordination game}
The coordination problem centers around aligning individual actions to achieve a mutually desired outcome. Typical examples of coordination problems include the pure coordination game where players benefit from aligning their choices, and network color game in which players try to avoid choosing the same option as others to maximize their individual gains.

\subsection{Pure coordination game}
The concept of committed individuals has gained significant attention in the field of coordination games, specifically regarding the emergence of social conventions~\cite{morris2019norm,haynes2017engineering}. Social conventions are widely accepted norms, rules, or behaviors that govern social interactions within a particular group, society, or culture. Researchers in this field aim to understand how social conventions are established, maintained, modified, and how they shape individual behavior and societal functioning\footnote{Although the terms "social convention" and "social norm" are sometimes used interchangeably, we will use the term "social convention" in accordance with the literature~\cite{haynes2017engineering}.}. Several theoretical studies have explored the potential impact of committed individuals on the emergence/convergence of social conventions by integrating them into different learning rules. For instance, Sen \etal~ proposed a social learning model where agents acquire their policies through repeated interactions with multiple agents, diverging from the traditional setting of learning from repeated interactions with the same player. By introducing a small number of committed agents who adopted a fixed-strategy, they demonstrated the ability of these agents to establish their actions as a global convention, influencing the behavior of other agents \cite{sen2007emergence}. Building upon Sen \etal's social learning rule, Mukherjee \etal~ investigated the influence of committed agents on the emergence of global social conventions on a grid. They found that when these agents adopt the same fixed strategy, the emergence of a social convention is expedited. Conversely, if they hold different strategies, multiple social conventions can emerge with equal probability, although these multiple social conventions are not observable within the population~\cite{mukherjee2008norm}. Within the reinforcement learning framework, Hao \etal~ examined the effects of committed agents on social optimal outcomes in asymmetric anti-coordination games, revealing that even a small number of committed agents can exert significant influence on the socially optimal outcome towards which the agents converge \cite{hao2013achieving}. Griffiths \etal~ analyzed the impact of committed agents on the speed of global convention emergence and the influence of different placement strategies by utilizing the Q-learning algorithm \cite{griffiths2012impact}. Yu \etal~ assessed the impact of commirred agents on the emergence of social conventions in networked multi-agent systems by employing a collective learning rule that combines several different learning rules. They found that convention emergence is unlikely in a society consisting solely of committed agents but becomes possible when combined with a small number of learners employing a fixed observation strategy \cite{yu2014collective}.  Additionally, Borglund \etal~ investigated the effects of committed agents on the emergence of local conventions and concluded that a larger number of committed agents generally leads to a faster emergence of local conventions, with only a few committed agents needed to convince communities to adopt their fixed actions \cite{borglund2018effects}. In their work, local conventions focus on specific agreements or patterns of behavior that emerge within smaller subgroups or communities, where nodes within the communities are internally densely connected but externally loosely connected. The mathematical definition of local conventions can be found in ref.~\cite{hu2017achieving}.

In contrast to the aforementioned works that primarily focused on how and why committed agents promote or accelerate the emergence of social conventions, there are also studies that explore other aspects. For instance, Marchant \etal~ demonstrated that committed agents can be used to destabilize or eliminate established global conventions. They investigated the minimum intervention required for destabilization and analyzed the impact of pricing mechanisms on intervention costs \cite{marchant2014destabilising}. In addition, one recent study investigate how the committed minorities can overturn the established social convention through large-scale human behavior experiment. In the study, Damon Centola \etal~ adopted an experimental approach to studying tipping point dynamics within an artificially created system of evolving social conventions. In their model, 194 subjects were recruited and invited to participate in a social coordination process. They were randomly assigned to one of 10 groups of 20-30 people. Participants engaged in pairwise interactions, naming pictured objects to coordinate with their partner. Successful coordination was rewarded, while failure was penalized. The goal was pairwise coordination, not global consensus. Participants had no information about the population size or connections. When a convention was established among all participants, a small number of committed individuals were introduced who continued entering the alternative strategy until the game was complete. The size of the committed minorities ranged from 15\% to 35\%. They showed that approximately 25\% of committed individuals can succeed in changing the established social convention, as illustrated in Figure \ref{f02}, which shows the final success levels from all their trials. Furthermore, the critical mass size of approximately 25\% was found to be robust against changes in population size, and the existence of the tipping point was also robust against the memory length.

\subsection{Color coordination game} In color coordination game\footnote{Although the networked color game does not strictly adhere to the traditional game-theoretical framework, it remains a vital component in coordination games. In this survey, we still analyze and summarize the impact of committed individuals within this framework.}, a group of agents, represented as nodes in a network, aims to select their colors simultaneously from a given set of colors~\cite{johnson1991optimization,kearns2006experimental,judd2010behavioral,kun2013anti}. The collective goal is for each node's color to be different from its neighboring nodes. The network itself can be generated using algorithms such as the preferential attachment rule~\cite{albert2000topology}. The minimum number of colors required to achieve a conflict-free coloring of the entire network is known as the chromatic number of the network, representing the minimum necessary color space for achieving a harmonious coloring. Kearns \etal~ organized large-scale human behavior experiments and allowed subjects to access only local information, such as their neighbors' colors and their own color, but lacked knowledge of the global decision. This allowed the game to proceed even if an agent solved the problem based on their individual viewpoint. The success of the game is measured by the number of remaining conflicts within a given time frame. If groups of agents can reach a global solution within the designated time, they receive a bonus. Conversely, if the game is not resolved within the time frame, no bonus is awarded. In line with this human-subject experiment, Judd \etal~ conducted extensive behavioral experiments and revealed a strong correlation between individual behavioral characteristics, such as stubbornness, and earnings. The findings indicated that individuals displaying resistance to changing their initial preferences or decisions tended to earn higher amounts~\cite{judd2010behavioral}. Additionally, Shirado \etal~ demonstrated that incorporating strategically placed bots in the network, programmed with a noisy strategy where individuals choose colors that minimize conflicts with neighbors while otherwise maintaining their current color, improved the collective performance of human groups~\cite{shirado2017locally}. Furthermore, they also found that the impact of bots with small noise was comparable to assigning nodes with fixed colors, directly applying the concept of committed individuals to achieve compatibility with a global solution. Other related numerical or theoretical solutions to this problem include reinforcement learning algorithms ($q$-bots) or myopic artificial agents~\cite{qi2019social, jones2021random}. Although these studies employed more sophisticated algorithms than simply designing agents with  colors, the concept of committed individuals can still be reflected, as these bots were preprogrammed and did not change their strategies over time.


\section{Social dilemma game}
Contrary to the coordination problem, cooperation problem necessitates individuals making sacrifices for the collective good. In the following, we will summarize the recent progress regarding the impact of committed individuals in cooperation problem. 

\subsection{One-shot social dilemma games}
The basic form of the social dilemma game involves two players and two strategies: cooperation (C) and defection (D). In this game, mutual cooperation results in a reward $R$, while mutual defection leads to a punishment $P$. When a cooperator interacts with a defector, the former receives a sucker's payoff $S$, and the latter obtains a temptation $T$. These parameters create four types of two-player social dilemma games, classified as follows \cite{wang2015universal}: prisoner's dilemma game (PD: $T>R>P>S$), snowdrift game (SD: $T>R>S>P$), stag hunt game (SH: $R>T>P>S$), and harmony game (H: $R>T, S>P$).

In one-shot social dilemma games, where reciprocity mechanisms such as reputation effects, repeated interactions, and other factors like prior commitment and intention are excluded, the committed player can be either a committed cooperator or a committed defector due to the limited strategy space in this framework. The concept of committed individuals in social dilemma games was initially introduced by Mauro Mobilia~\cite{PhysRevE.86.011134}. He proposed cooperation facilitators, which enhance the fitness of cooperators but have no effect on defectors' fitness. Additionally, cooperation facilitators do not accumulate payoffs, and their strategies cannot spread. Mobilia's research focused on cooperators in finite populations and provided analytical conditions for the fixation of cooperation~\cite{PhysRevE.86.011134,MOBILIA2013113}. Later, the impact of cooperation facilitators was extended to networked populations~\cite{PhysRevE.89.042802}. Around the same time, Naoki Masuda introduced zealots in one-shot social dilemma games. Zealots enhance the payoff of both cooperators and defectors and can attract others to adopt their strategy, which distinguishes them from cooperation facilitators~\cite{masuda2012evolution}. Masuda's study explored imperfect zealous cooperators who occasionally choose defection, finding that cooperation prevails under certain conditions~\cite{masuda2012evolution}. Later, Masuda and his collaborators extended their results on infinite and well-mixed populations to finite well-mixed populations \cite{nakajima2015evolutionary}. In the finite population, fixation probability quantifies the probability that a given strategy eventually dominates the population as a result of stochastic evolutionary games. The presence of zealots makes the fixation trivially occur since zealots' strategy always fixates. Therefore, they focused on the fixation time in the presence of zealots and showed that, unlike the case without zealots, there is a threshold selection intensity below which the fixation is fast for an arbitrary payoff matrix. Matsuzawa \etal~ extended the research scope of zealots from unstructured populations to structured populations and explored the impact of zealots on cooperation in structured populations \cite{matsuzawa2016spatial}. They found that the presence of committed individuals does not always promote cooperation when the spatial structure is introduced. Cardillo and Masuda investigated how and why zealots can trigger the large-scale critical mass of cooperation in both well-mixed and structured populations by considering the entire strategy space in social dilemma games \cite{cardillo2020critical}. They found that only the stag-hunt game displays a clear critical mass effect, while the critical mass of cooperation in the other two dilemmas (snowdrift game and prisoner's dilemma game) relies on the selection pressure, the updating rule, or considers heterogeneous networks.

Guo \etal~ made two critical extensions based on the aforementioned work in the context of human-machine hybrid populations, considering stag-hunt game, snowdrift game, and prisoner's dilemma \cite{guo2023facilitating}. Firstly, they relaxed the assumption that a committed player can only choose a specific strategy with a probability of 1, and instead employed a probability $\phi \in [0,1]$ to control the behavior of committed individuals. Secondly, they introduced a substantial number of committed players as autonomous agents. They found that cooperative committed individuals have a limited impact on the prisoner’s dilemma (see Figure \ref{f03}A), but they facilitate cooperation in stag hunt games, and defective committed individuals, which initially seem detrimental to cooperation, can promote the complete dominance of cooperation in snowdrift games. However, as the proportion of committed individuals substantially increases, both cooperative and defective committed individuals carry the potential risk of transitioning from a state of coexistence to a full defection state (see Figure \ref{f03}B and C). Moreover, in scenarios with weak imitation strength, cooperative committed individuals are able to maintain or even promote cooperation in all these games (see bottom panels of Figure \ref{f03}). Finally, they tested the results on networked populations, and the results suggest that the effectiveness of committed individuals in promoting cooperation can be maximized by carefully considering their design and application in a given context. Recently, Wang \etal~ extended the research scope of committed individuals in pairwise social dilemma games to the public goods game \cite{wang2023zealous}. They found that a moderate number of committed cooperators can diminish overall cooperation, and cooperation is promoted only when committed cooperators are numerous. However, in unstructured populations, committed cooperation always promotes cooperation, indicating that the hindrance effect is primarily a spatial phenomenon. Majhi investigated how a finite fraction of these committed minorities, present in both cooperators and defectors, govern the evolutionary game dynamics where interactions among individuals with the same strategy are more probable than random interactions \cite{majhi2023cooperation}. Zhang introduced committed cooperators and defectors into the spatial prisoner's dilemma game simultaneously and found that a minority of committed players could effectively inhibit cooperation, but the presence of noise could cancel this inhibition effect \cite{zhang2022effects}. Furthermore, the notion of dedicated individuals has found application in both the ultimatum game to tackle fairness issues and in AI-related research, as evidenced by several studies \cite{santos2019evolution, zheng2022probabilistic,cimpeanu2022artificial,booker2023discriminatory}. 

In contrast to the aforementioned works that primarily focused on social dilemma games with two basic strategies, there are also several studies that have extended the research on committed individuals to social dilemma games with multiple strategies, addressing various problems. For instance, in the conundrum of punishment, where the effectiveness of prosocial punishment on cooperation is challenged by second-order free riders and antisocial punishment~\cite{hauser2014punishment, rand2011evolution}, Shen \etal~ attempted to address this issue in the context of human-machine hybrid populations~\cite{shen2022simple}. In the study, a two-stage prisoner's dilemma game was used, where players needed to choose between cooperation and defection in the first stage and decide whether to punish their opponent in the second stage. The introduction of simple bots, designed as committed prosocial punishers, allowed prosocial punishment among human players to dominate in both well-mixed and networked populations. Furthermore, when human players exhibited a learning bias towards the "copy the majority" rule or the bots were placed at higher degree nodes in scale-free networks, full dominance of prosocial punishment remained possible, even at high dilemma strength. These results provided a novel explanation for the evolution of prosocial punishment. In line with the framework of human-machine game, Sharma \etal~ explored how simple bots, designed based on the concept of committed individuals, could facilitate the evolution of cooperation in optional prisoner's dilemma games\cite{sharma2023small}. The model involved three strategies: cooperation, defection, and loner, and two types of players: human players and bot players. The pre-designed bots had strategies of always choosing to cooperate, always choosing to defect, always choosing to be a loner, and choosing cooperation, defection, and loner randomly.  Results showed that cooperative bots promoted cooperation in well-mixed populations and regular lattices under weak imitation scenarios. Moreover, introducing loner bots enhanced cooperation in regular lattices under strong imitation scenarios, but an excess of loner bots hindered cooperation and led to its breakdown.

\subsection{Social dilemma game with repeated interactions} 
Shirado and Christakis expanded the research scope on committed individuals from one-shot social dilemma games to include repeated interactions, enabling players to engage with opponents multiple times~\cite{shirado2020network}. This expanded framework introduced diverse strategies like Tit-for-tat, which begins with cooperation and mirrors opponents' actions in subsequent rounds, and extortion, establishing a linear relationship between an individual's payoff and their opponent's payoff~\cite{nowak1992tit,press2012iterated}. In contrast, one-shot social dilemma games are limited to ALL C (cooperate) and ALL D (defect) strategies. This strategy diversity enables a more flexible design of committed strategies. In a study, Shirado \etal~ investigated how simple bots influence cooperation in repeated prisoner's dilemma games~\cite{shirado2020network}. The bots consistently cooperated with participants and allowed them to rewire connections. The results demonstrated that bots' intervention effectively reshaped interaction dynamics, encouraging sustained cooperation and enhancing group cooperation in addressing the public goods dilemma. Considering the emergence of a critical mass of cooperation in one-shot social dilemma games is subject to specific game characteristics, imitation strength, or network structure~\cite{cardillo2020critical}. He et al. introduced the committed extortion strategy to both well-mixed and structured populations, and the results suggest that the critical mass of cooperation might represent a universal principle in social dilemma games when considering repeated interactions~\cite{he2023impact}. Furthermore, several scholars have utilized the notion of committed individuals to examine the evolution of cooperation through the application of reinforcement learning techniques~\cite{ding2023emergence,han2022hybrid}. They employed reinforcement learning methods to devise the agent's strategy, ensuring that the strategy remains under the control of the reinforcement learning algorithm without undergoing any changes over time.

\subsection{Vaccination game} 
In contrast to the pure social dilemma game, the vaccination game combines the social dilemma with the disease-spreading process~\cite{fu2011imitation}. The dilemma arises from the conflict between personal and collective interests: individuals must decide whether to avoid vaccination or take the vaccine for the maximum collective benefit. For a rational individual, the best option is to avoid vaccination, regardless of what others do, as free riders who pay nothing for vaccination can still escape infection if herd immunity is established. Liu \etal~ investigated the impact of committed vaccinated individuals who always hold a vaccination strategy on the vaccination rate and disease spreading~\cite{liu2012impact}. They found that a small fraction of these committed individuals, acting as 'steadfast role models' in the population, can inhibit the formation of clusters of susceptible individuals and help promote vaccination coverage, thus inhibiting disease spreading. 
Fukuda and Tanimoto conducted a study to explore the effects of committed vaccinated and unvaccinated individuals on individual-level vaccination behavior and infectious disease spread in a social network under a voluntary vaccination policy~\cite{fukuda2016effects}. They relaxed the assumption of committed vaccinators and found that even a small fraction of committed vaccinators can positively influence vaccination behavior and impede epidemic spreading, even in the presence of committed unvaccinated individuals. The impact of both types of committed individuals varies based on their proportion within the population, population structure, and the relative cost of vaccination \cite{fukuda2016effects}.

\section{Conclusions and prospects}
In conclusion, this survey underscores the profound impact of committed individuals on coordination and social dilemma games. Such individuals play a significant role in accelerating the emergence or overturning of social conventions, expediting solutions for color coordination issues, addressing cooperation and fairness challenges, resolving vaccination dilemmas, and other aspects. Furthermore, these influences are shaped by players' internal properties, such as memory length, imitation strength, or strategy updating rules, as well as external factors, including network topologies, population size, or the game model. While significant progress has been made, there remain promising avenues for future exploration.

\subsection{Empirical evidence on the impact of committed individuals}
While there are already some theoretical studies investigating how and why committed individuals can influence social dynamics in different domains, whether these theoretical findings can seamlessly apply to human society remains an open question. The theoretical simplicity assumption, especially when describing how humans update their strategies in realistic scenarios, including their unique attitudes and emotions towards committed individuals, still raises concerns about the validity of these findings in practical situations. To bridge this gap, human behavior experiments serve as powerful tools, offering insights into the dynamics of human decision-making and providing robust empirical tests for theoretical findings. Moving forward, it is crucial to explore the influence of committed individuals within this experimental framework. This approach will enable us to gain a deeper understanding of how and why committed individuals impact human behavior in realistic settings, including their potential to drive large-scale societal changes.
\subsection{Large language models as proxy of committed individuals in complex scenarios}
While theoretical studies offer valuable insights into social dynamics, one critique of previous theoretical models is that they might oversimplify the behavior of committed individuals, potentially missing the intricacies of real-world human decision-making and interactions. However, recent advancements in large language models present a promising direction. These models are trained on vast amounts of human data and possess expressive language and logical reasoning capabilities. In many cases, they exhibit human-like or even superhuman characteristics. Leveraging large language models to define the behavior of committed individuals through appropriate prompts allows for highly intelligent responses, surpassing the limitations of handcrafted rules. By exploring their impact on social systems in a more realistic manner, we can significantly advance our knowledge of social dynamics and gain a deeper understanding of how committed individuals drive societal changes in diverse and intricate settings.
\subsection{Addressing ethical risks of committed individuals in the digital world}
Most existing studies have focused on the positive impact of committed individuals in solving various realistic problems, such as accelerating the emergence or convergence of social conventions, addressing cooperation and fairness challenges, vaccination dilemmas, and other aspects. However, it is crucial to also consider the potential negative aspects of committed individuals. By referring to our real world problems concerning 'virtual society' such as Twitter, SNS, and other media, it is quite important how the evolutionary game theory is able to model the committed individuals who are sometimes steadfast and stubborn intentionally leading the shared opinion to a certain direction. If such committed individuals in a virtual community are artificially generated as so-called 'bot' players, someone equipped with strong AI systems can favourably manipulate the community, which may threaten the free speech of democracy. While eliminating social media bots entirely remains a formidable challenge, mitigating the negative impact of committed individuals requires robust algorithms to detect bot accounts and strike a balance between their positive and negative aspects. A deeper understanding of the overall impact of committed individuals in social dynamics is essential to address these ethical risks effectively.

%where $\rho_C$ represents the frequency of cooperation in normal players. The dynamics of the game follow a comparison rule with the Fermi function. 
%In the strategy updating process, an ordered pair of players, say $(i,j)$, is selected randomly, where player $i$ with strategy $\mathcal{X}$ and $i$ with strategy $\mathcal{Y}$. If $\mathcal{X} \neq \mathcal{Y}$, player $i$ takes $j$ as a reference and imitates its strategy with a probability determined by the Fermi function,
%\begin{equation}
%W_{\mathcal{X} \leftarrow \mathcal{Y}}=\frac{1}{1+e^{-K(\pi_{\mathcal{Y}}-\pi_{\mathcal{X}})}},
%\end{equation}
%where $K$ represents selection intensity and measures the irrational degree of human players. In the well-mixed population, the probability that a cooperator taking a defector as an indicator is $\mathbf{P}_1 = \frac{\rho_C(1-\rho_C+y(1-\phi))}{1+y}$. 
%Cooperators decrease by one with probability $Q^{-}  = \mathbf{P}_1 W_{C \leftarrow D}$.
%On the other hand, a defector takes a cooperator as an indicator with probability $\mathbf{P}_2 = \frac{(\rho_C+y\phi)(1-\rho_C)}{1+y}$. Then, cooperators increase by one with probability
%$Q^{+} = \mathbf{P}_2 W_{D \leftarrow C} $. In total, the dynamics of cooperation can be represented as by $\dot{\rho}_C  = Q^{+} - Q^{-}$. 

%The equilibrium can be obtained by solving $\dot{\rho}_C=0$. Since obtaining an analytical solution is intractable, Fig.~\ref{pairw} presents numerical and simulation results. In the PD game (see Fig.~\ref{pairw} A), cooperation is difficult to emerge under strong imitation strength. When imitation strength becomes weak (see $K=1$), cooperation emerges and increases with $y$. This cooperation-promoting effect is particularly significant in the presence of stubborn players with higher cooperation probability. As for the SD game (see Fig.~\ref{pairw} B), cooperation increases (or decreases) with the proportion of stubborn players when $\phi=0.1$ (or $\phi=0.9$) under strong imitation strength. It is defective stubborn players, not cooperative type, that can stimulate the evolution of cooperation. However, the results become totally contrary when imitation strength weakens (see $K=1$): stubborn players with higher cooperation probability are more beneficial to the evolution of cooperation. In the SH game (see Fig.~\ref{pairw} C), cooperative stubborn players behave better than defective type in stimulating cooperation. In particular, if defective stubborn players take a larger proportion, cooperation may collapse in this system.
