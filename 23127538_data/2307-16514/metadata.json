  "abstract": "Although the studies of tensor structure of the Higgs boson interactions with vector bosons and fermions at CMS and ATLAS experiments have established that the $J^{\\mathrm{PC}}$ quantum numbers of the Higgs boson should be $0^{++}$, small CP violation in the Higgs sector (up to 10% contribution of the CP-odd state) cannot be excluded with the current experimental precision. We review possibilities to measure CP violating mixing angle $Ψ_{\\mathrm{CP}}$ between scalar and pseudoscalar states, at a linear electron-positron collider, at center-of-mass energy of 1 TeV.",
