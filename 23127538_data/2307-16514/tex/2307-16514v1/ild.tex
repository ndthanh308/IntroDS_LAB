\section{The ILD Concept and MC Samples}
\label{sec:ILDMC}
ILD~\cite{ILDIDR, ILDESU, TDR4} is one of the proposed detector concepts for future $e^+e^-$ Higgs factories.
It is highly-hermetic multi-purpose detector designed for particle flow reconstruction.
ILD consists of a high precision vertex detector, a time projection chamber, silicon tracking detectors, a highly granular calorimeter system and a forward detector system, all placed inside of a solenoid providing a magnetic field of $3.5$\,T, surrounded by an iron yoke instrumented for muon detection.
The jet energy resolution as a function of $|\cos \theta _{\mathrm{thrust}}|$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:JER}.
Details of the ILD design, as well as about the particle flow concept can be found in Refs.~\cite{TDR4, LongESU, PFA}.
