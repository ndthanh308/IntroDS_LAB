  "abstract": "The astrophysical origins of the binary black hole systems seen with gravitational waves are still not well understood. However, features in the distribution of black-hole masses, spins, redshifts, and eccentricities provide clues into how these systems form. Much has been learned by investigating these distributions one parameter at a time. However, we can extract additional information by studying the covariance between pairs of parameters. Previous work has shown preliminary support for an anti-correlation between mass ratio $q \\equiv m_2/m_1$ and effective inspiral spin $χ_\\mathrm{eff}$ in the binary black hole population. In this study, we test for the existence of this anti-correlation using updated data from the third gravitational wave transient catalogue (GWTC-3) and improve our copula-based framework to employ a more robust model for black-hole spins. We find evidence for an anti-correlation in $(q, χ_\\mathrm{eff})$ with 99.7% credibility. This may imply high common-envelope efficiencies, stages of super-Eddington accretion, or a tendency for binary black hole systems to undergo mass-ratio reversal during isolated evolution. Covariance in $(q,χ_\\mathrm{eff})$ may also be used to investigate the physics of tidal spin-up as well as the properties of binary-black-hole-forming active galactic nuclei.",
