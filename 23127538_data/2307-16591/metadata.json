  "abstract": "Many applications of quantum optics demand delicate quantum properties of light carefully tailored to accomplish a specific task. To this end, numerical simulations of quantum light sources are vital for designing, characterizing, and optimizing quantum photonic technology. Here, I show that exploiting information hidden in zero-photon measurement outcomes provides an exponential speedup for time-integrated photon counting simulations, realizing eight orders of magnitude reduction in the time to compute six-photon detection probabilities while achieving ten orders of magnitude higher precision compared to the state of the art. This enables simulations of large photonic experiments with an unprecedented level of physical detail. It can accelerate the design of sources to generate photonic resource states for quantum sensing and measurement-based quantum computing while capturing realistic imperfections. It also establishes a general theoretical framework to study dynamic interactions between stationary qubits mediated by measurements of flying qubits, which can be used to model distributed quantum computing and quantum communication.",
