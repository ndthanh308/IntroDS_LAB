  "abstract": "Rational normal form is a powerful tool to deal with Hamiltonian partial differential equations without external parameters. In this paper, we build rational normal form with exact global control of small divisors. As an application to nonlinear Schrödinger equations in Gevrey spaces, we prove sub-exponentially long time stability results for generic small initial data.",
