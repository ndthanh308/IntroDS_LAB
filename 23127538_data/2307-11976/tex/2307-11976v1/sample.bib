abstract = {In this work, the KAIST Mueller measurement database is compressed by assuming a triply degeneracy (TD) in the Cloude coherency eigenspectrum. This assumption compresses the database by a factor of two by reparameterizes the database into eight parameters, maintains physicality when interpolated for non-measured geometries, and is shown to retain the dominant polarimetric properties for both diffuse and specular light-matter interactions. For each 4\&\#x2009;\&\#x00D7;\&\#x2009;4 Mueller matrix, the 8 TD parameters are: the radiometric average throughput, a depolarization parameter, and 6 parameters to describe the dominant coherent process. Polarimetric importance sampling is made possible by interpreting the eigenspectrum as probabilities. To evaluate the proposed methods, a sphere is rendered using the pink silicone material from the KAIST pBRDF database and compared to a TD compressed and polarimetric importance sampled pBRDF rendering. The average deviation in the polarizance angle and degree of linear polarization (AoLP and DoLP) deviation was 16.9\&\#x00B0; and 1.1\&\#x0025; for both the TD compressed and polarimetric importance sampled pBRDF model as compared to the KAIST pBRDF model, respectively. The pBRDF models are also compared by rendering two scenes containing multiple surface interactions and several material types. Polarimetric importance sampling convergence and its dependence on the materials\&\#x2019; depolarization and ray depth are reported for these scenes.},

In contrast to traditional photometric stereo, the spherical patterns allow normals to be estimated simultaneously from any number of viewpoints. We present two polarized lighting techniques that allow the diffuse and specular normal maps of an object to be measured independently. For scattering materials, we show that the specular normal maps yield the best record of detailed surface shape while the diffuse normals deviate from the true surface normal due to subsurface scattering, and that this effect is dependent on wavelength. We show several applications of this acquisition technique. First, we capture normal maps of a facial performance simultaneously from several viewing positions using time-multiplexed illumination. Second, we show that highresolution normal maps based on the specular component can be used with structured light 3D scanning to quickly acquire high-resolution facial surface geometry using off-the-shelf digital still cameras. Finally, we present a realtime shading model that uses independently estimated normal maps for the specular and diffuse color channels to reproduce some of the perceptually important effects of subsurface scattering.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 18th Eurographics Conference on Rendering Techniques}, pages = {183–194}, numpages = {12}, location = {Grenoble, France}, series = {EGSR'07} }

This optimization generalizes to multiple PSA/PSG pairs so that the classification performance as a function of number of polarimetric measurements can be considered. Optimizing PSA/PSG pairs gives insight into which polarimetric measurements are most useful for the binary classification. For example, in scenes with strong diattenuation, retardance, or depolarization certain PSA/PSG pairs would make two regions in an image look very similar and other pairs would make the regions look very different. The method presented in this paper provides a quantitative method for ensuring the images acquired can be classified optimally.},

	abstract = {Detection of aerosol types, components having different size and chemical composition, over urban areas is important for understanding their impact on health and climate. In particular, sustained contact with size-differentiated airborne particulate matter: PM10 and PM2.5 can lead to adverse health effects such as asthma attacks, heart and lung diseases, and premature mortality. Multi-angular polarimetric measurements have been advocated in recent years as an additional tool to better understand and retrieve the aerosol properties needed for improved predictions of aerosol impart on air quality and climate. We deployed the ground-based Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (GroundMSPI) for accurate spectropolarimetric and radiance measurements co-located with the AERONET CIMEL sun photometer and a Halo Doppler 18 m resolution lidar from San Jos√© State University at the Garland-Fresno Air Quality supersite in Fresno, CA on July 7 during the Imaging Polarimetric Assessment and Characterization of Tropospheric Particulate Matter (ImPACT-PM) field experiment. GroundMSPI sampled the atmospheric scattering phase function in and 90 degrees out of the principal plane every 15 minutes in an automated manner, utilizing the 2-axis gimbal mount in elevation and azimuth. The goal of this work is verify atmospheric measurement of GroundMSPI with the coincident CIMEL sun photometer and ground-based lidar. Diffuse-sky radiance measurements of GroundMSPI are compared with the CIMEL sun photometer throughout the day. AERONET aerosol parameters such as size, shape, and index of refraction as well as lidar aerosol extinction profiles will be used in a forward radiative transfer model to compare with GroundMSPI observations and optimize these parameters to best match GroundMSPI data.},

A widely used backscattering pBSDF model proposed by Priest and Meier \[Opt. Eng.41, 988 (2002)10.1117/1.1467360\] is a weighted sum between a Fresnel matrix and an ideal depolarizer. This work\&\#x2019;s main contribution is relating the relative weight between an ideal depolarizer and Fresnel matrix to a single depolarization parameter. Rather than a 16-dimensional matrix norm, this parameter can form a one-dimensional merit function. Then, instead of a full Mueller matrix measurement, a scheme for pBSDF fitting to only two polarimetric measurements is introduced. Depolarization can be mathematically expressed as the incoherent addition of coherent states \[J. Opt. Soc. Am. A30, 691 (2013)10.1364/JOSAA.30.000691\]. This work shows that, for a Mueller matrix to be in the span of a Fresnel matrix and an ideal depolarizer, the weights in the incoherent addition are triply degenerate. This triple degeneracy is observed in five different colored opaque plastics treated with nine different surface textures and measured at varying acquisition geometries and wavebands.},

	abstract = {We present a new method for computing optimized channels for channelized quadratic observers (CQO) that is feasible for high-dimensional image data. The method for calculating channels is applicable in general and optimal for Gaussian distributed image data. Gradient-based algorithms for determining the channels are presented for five different information-based figures of merit (FOMs). Analytic solutions for the optimum channels for each of the five FOMs are derived for the case of equal mean data for both classes. The optimum channels for three of the FOMs under the equal mean condition are shown to be the same. This result is critical since some of the FOMs are much easier to compute. Implementing the CQO requires a set of channels and the first- and second-order statistics of channelized image data from both classes. The dimensionality reduction from M measurements to L channels is a critical advantage of CQO since estimating image statistics from channelized data requires smaller sample sizes and inverting a smaller covariance matrix is easier. In a simulation study we compare the performance of ideal and Hotelling observers to CQO. The optimal CQO channels are calculated using both eigenanalysis and a new gradient-based algorithm for maximizing Jeffrey's divergence (J). Optimal channel selection without eigenanalysis makes the J-CQO on large-dimensional image data feasible.},

	abstract = {We present a new method for computing optimized channels for estimation tasks that is feasible for high-dimensional image data. Maximum-likelihood (ML) parameter estimates are challenging to compute from high-dimensional likelihoods. The dimensionality reduction from M measurements to L channels is a critical advantage of channelized quadratic estimators (CQEs), since estimating likelihood moments from channelized data requires smaller sample sizes and inverting a smaller covariance matrix is easier. The channelized likelihood is then used to form ML estimates of the parameter(s). In this work we choose an imaging example in which the second-order statistics of the image data depend upon the parameter of interest: the correlation length. Correlation lengths are used to approximate background textures in many imaging applications, and in these cases an estimate of the correlation length is useful for pre-whitening. In a simulation study we compare the estimation performance, as measured by the root-mean-squared error (RMSE), of correlation length estimates from CQE and power spectral density (PSD) distribution fitting. To abide by the assumptions of the PSD method we simulate an ergodic, isotropic, stationary, and zero-mean random process. These assumptions are not part of the CQE formalism. The CQE method assumes a Gaussian channelized likelihood that can be a valid for non-Gaussian image data, since the channel outputs are formed from weighted sums of the image elements. We have shown that, for three or more channels, the RMSE of CQE estimates of correlation length is lower than conventional PSD estimates. We also show that computing CQE by using a standard nonlinear optimization method produces channels that yield RMSE within 2\% of the analytic optimum. CQE estimates of anisotropic correlation length estimation are reported to demonstrate this technique on a two-parameter estimation problem.},

In-line radiative transfer calculations are indispensable if a large state vector, including both atmospheric profiles and surface properties, is used to improve retrieval accuracy. However, in-line radiative transfer calculations are usually not computationally efficient for remote sensing applications. Therefore, there is a pressing need to develop an accurate and fast vector radiative transfer model (RTM) to fully utilize spaceborne polarimetric observations. This paper reports on a fast vector RTM, referred to as TAMU-VRTM, in support of polarimetric remote sensing, which is capable of simulating the Stokes vector values observed at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface by fully considering absorption, scattering, and emission in the atmosphere and ocean. Gaseous absorption is parameterized with respect to gas concentration, temperature, and pressure, by using a regression method applicable to an inhomogeneous atmospheric path. An efficient two-component approach combining the small-angle approximation and the adding-doubling method is utilized to solve the vector radiative transfer equation (RTE). The thermal emission component of the RTE solution is obtained by an efficient doubling process. The air-sea interface is treated as a wind-ruffled rough surface in the model to mimic a realistic ocean surface. Several oceanic optical property models are introduced to model ocean inherent optical properties. To demonstrate the applicability of the TAMU-VRTM, simulations are compared with satellite observations, and results from other vector radiative transfer methods including benchmarks.},

Thus, it is desirable to match this formalism in thermal polarimetry and report the unnormalized Stokes parameters in units of \textit{K} instead of radiance (\textit{W}\textit{m}$^{\textrm{-2}}$\textit{sr}$^{\textrm{-1}}$). This approach also allows common performance metrics in long-wave infrared (LWIR) imaging such as Noise Equivalent Differential Temperature (NEDT) to be modified and extended to metrics of polarimetric accuracy and precision. However, since the relationship between measured radiance and \textit{T$_{\textrm{b}}$} are non-linear, the conversion of \textit{I}, \textit{Q}, and \textit{U} in units of radiance to \textit{T$_{\textrm{b}}$}, T$_{\textrm{b,Q,}}$ and T$_{\textrm{b,U}}$ in \textit{K} is ambiguous.

	abstract = {Reconstructing an object's geometry and appearance from multiple images, also known as inverse rendering, is a fundamental problem in computer graphics and vision. Inverse rendering is inherently ill-posed because the captured image is an intricate function of unknown lighting conditions, material properties and scene geometry. Recent progress in representing scene properties as coordinate-based neural networks have facilitated neural inverse rendering resulting in impressive geometry reconstruction and novel-view synthesis. Our key insight is that polarization is a useful cue for neural inverse rendering as polarization strongly depends on surface normals and is distinct for diffuse and specular reflectance. With the advent of commodity, on-chip, polarization sensors, capturing polarization has become practical. Thus, we propose PANDORA, a polarimetric inverse rendering approach based on implicit neural representations. From multi-view polarization images of an object, PANDORA jointly extracts the object's 3D geometry, separates the outgoing radiance into diffuse and specular and estimates the illumination incident on the object. We show that PANDORA outperforms state-of-the-art radiance decomposition techniques. PANDORA outputs clean surface reconstructions free from texture artefacts, models strong specularities accurately and estimates illumination under practical unstructured scenarios.},

In this work we focus on how to include polarization within a bidirectional rendering algorithm. For that, we generalize the path integral to support the constraints imposed by non-symmetric light transport.

With the aim of realizing a compact acquisition setup without multiple angular samples of light and view, we sought to leverage an alternative optical property of light, polarization. To this end, we capture a set of polarimetric images with linear polarizers in front of a single projector and camera to obtain the appearance and normals of real-world objects. We encountered two technical challenges: First, no complete polarimetric BRDF model is available for modeling mixed polarization of both specular and diffuse reflection. Second, existing polarization-based inverse rendering methods are not applicable to a single local illumination setup since they are formulated with the assumption of spherical illumination. To this end, we first present a complete polarimetric BRDF (pBRDF) model that can define mixed polarization of both specular and diffuse reflection. Second, by leveraging our pBRDF model, we propose a novel inverse-rendering method with joint optimization of pBRDF and normals to capture spatially-varying material appearance: per-material specular properties (including the refractive index, specular roughness and specular coefficient), per-pixel diffuse albedo and normals. Our method can solve the severely ill-posed inverse-rendering problem by carefully accounting for the physical relationship between polarimetric appearance and geometric properties. We demonstrate how our method overcomes limited sampling in light-view space for inverse rendering by means of polarization.}, journal = {ACM Trans.

abstract = "Generative reconstruction methods compute the 3D configuration (such as pose and/or geometry) of a shape by optimizing the overlap of the projected 3D shape model with images. Proper handling of occlusions is a big challenge, since the visibility function that indicates if a surface point is seen from a camera can often not be formulated in closed form, and is in general discrete and non-differentiable at occlusion boundaries. We present a new scene representation that enables an analytically differentiable closed-form formulation of surface visibility. In contrast to previous methods, this yields smooth, analytically differentiable, and efficient to optimize pose similarity energies with rigorous occlusion handling, fewer local minima, and experimentally verified improved convergence of numerical optimization. The underlying idea is a new image formation model that represents opaque objects by a translucent medium with a smooth Gaussian density distribution which turns visibility into a smooth phenomenon. We demonstrate the advantages of our versatile scene model in several generative pose estimation problems, namely marker-less multi-object pose estimation, marker-less human motion capture with few cameras, and image-based 3D geometry estimation.",

	abstract = {Detection of aerosol types, components having different size and chemical composition, over urban areas is important for understanding their impact on health and climate. In particular, sustained contact with size-differentiated airborne particulate matter: PM10 and PM2.5 can lead to adverse health effects such as asthma attacks, heart and lung diseases, and premature mortality. Multi-angular polarimetric measurements have been advocated in recent years as an additional tool to better understand and retrieve the aerosol properties needed for improved predictions of aerosol impart on air quality and climate. We deployed the ground-based Multiangle SpectroPolarimetric Imager (GroundMSPI) for accurate spectropolarimetric and radiance measurements co-located with the AERONET CIMEL sun photometer and a Halo Doppler 18 m resolution lidar from San José State University at the Garland-Fresno Air Quality supersite in Fresno, CA on July 7 during the Imaging Polarimetric Assessment and Characterization of Tropospheric Particulate Matter (ImPACT-PM) field experiment. GroundMSPI sampled the atmospheric scattering phase function in and 90 degrees out of the principal plane every 15 minutes in an automated manner, utilizing the 2-axis gimbal mount in elevation and azimuth. The goal of this work is verify atmospheric measurement of GroundMSPI with the coincident CIMEL sun photometer and ground-based lidar. Diffuse-sky radiance measurements of GroundMSPI are compared with the CIMEL sun photometer throughout the day. AERONET aerosol parameters such as size, shape, and index of refraction as well as lidar aerosol extinction profiles will be used in a forward radiative transfer model to compare with GroundMSPI observations and optimize these parameters to best match GroundMSPI data.},

This paper reports on a fast vector RTM, referred to as TAMU-VRTM, in support of polarimetric remote sensing, which is capable of simulating the Stokes vector values observed at the top of the atmosphere and at the surface by fully considering absorption, scattering, and emission in the atmosphere and ocean. Gaseous absorption is parameterized with respect to gas concentration, temperature, and pressure, by using a regression method applicable to an inhomogeneous atmospheric path. An efficient two-component approach combining the small-angle approximation and the adding-doubling method is utilized to solve the vector radiative transfer equation (RTE). The thermal emission component of the RTE solution is obtained by an efficient doubling process. The air-sea interface is treated as a wind-ruffled rough surface in the model to mimic a realistic ocean surface. Several oceanic optical property models are introduced to model ocean inherent optical properties. To demonstrate the applicability of the TAMU-VRTM, simulations are compared with satellite observations, and results from other vector radiative transfer methods including benchmarks.},

	abstract = {In remote sensing, radiometric measurements taken in the mid-wave infrared and beyond (\&lambda; \&gt; 3\textit{\&mu;m}) are commonly reported in units of Kelvin by utilizing Planck's radiation law to relate measured radiance and target brightness temperature (\textit{T$_{\textrm{b}}$}). Thus, it is desirable to match this formalism in thermal polarimetry and report the unnormalized Stokes parameters in units of \textit{K} instead of radiance (\textit{W}\textit{m}$^{\textrm{-2}}$\textit{sr}$^{\textrm{-1}}$). This approach also allows common performance metrics in long-wave infrared (LWIR) imaging such as Noise Equivalent Differential Temperature (NEDT) to be modified and extended to metrics of polarimetric accuracy and precision. However, since the relationship between measured radiance and \textit{T$_{\textrm{b}}$} are non-linear, the conversion of \textit{I}, \textit{Q}, and \textit{U} in units of radiance to \textit{T$_{\textrm{b}}$}, T$_{\textrm{b,Q,}}$ and T$_{\textrm{b,U}}$ in \textit{K} is ambiguous. As a solution a metric of performance for thermal linear Stokes polarimetry, the Stokes resolved differential temperature (SRDT), is introduced.},

The previous state-of-the-art methods for SfP have been purely physics-based. We see value in these principled models, and blend these physical models as priors into a neural network architecture. This proposed approach achieves results that exceed the previous state-of-the-art on a challenging dataset we introduce. This dataset consists of polarization images taken over a range of object textures, paints, and lighting conditions. We report that our proposed method achieves the lowest test error on each tested condition in our dataset, showing the value of blending data-driven and physics-driven approaches.",

abstract="A polarization camera has great potential for 3D reconstruction since the angle of polarization (AoP) of reflected light is related to an object's surface normal. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D reconstruction method called Polarimetric Multi-View Inverse Rendering (Polarimetric MVIR) that effectively exploits geometric, photometric, and polarimetric cues extracted from input multi-view color polarization images. We first estimate camera poses and an initial 3D model by geometric reconstruction with a standard structure-from-motion and multi-view stereo pipeline. We then refine the initial model by optimizing photometric rendering errors and polarimetric errors using multi-view RGB and AoP images, where we propose a novel polarimetric cost function that enables us to effectively constrain each estimated surface vertex's normal while considering four possible ambiguous azimuth angles revealed from the AoP measurement. Experimental results using both synthetic and real data demonstrate that our Polarimetric MVIR can reconstruct a detailed 3D shape without assuming a specific polarized reflection depending on the material.",

We also show that the coherent linear combination of nondepolarizing optical media states and depolarization phenomena can be reformulated in terms of quaternion states.},

abstract = {Abstract Significant advances have been achieved for realtime ray tracing recently, but realtime performance for complex scenes still requires large computational resources not yet available from the CPUs in standard PCs. Incidentally, most of these PCs also contain modern GPUs that do offer much larger raw compute power. However, limitations in the programming and memory model have so far kept the performance of GPU ray tracers well below that of their CPU counterparts. In this paper we present a novel packet ray traversal implementation that completely eliminates the need for maintaining a stack during kd-tree traversal and that reduces the number of traversal steps per ray. While CPUs benefit moderately from the stackless approach, it improves GPU performance significantly. We achieve a peak performance of over 16 million rays per second for reasonably complex scenes, including complex shading and secondary rays. Several examples show that with this new technique GPUs can actually outperform equivalent CPU based ray tracers.},

You might have heard about it, but the technical details - what exactly it is all about, how it is best done, what the benefits are, where you ought to use it, and where you can safely omit it - are not that well known. At least in principle, information about all this is available already - but it is scattered across many different sources, some of which are outside graphics literature, and consequently can be a bit hard to find at first. Also, a number of these resources - in particular publications in physics literature - were not written with graphics engineering in mind, and can prove hard to directly apply to the engineering problem of getting such a Tenderer to work. This course aims to provide a unified one-stop information resource on this topic, and should enable graphics engineers with a background in physically-based rendering to properly assess whether the phenomenon has to be included in a given simulation, and what has to be done in order to properly allow for handling of the phenomenon in a ray-based Tenderer. However, the contents of the course are also potentially very relevant for other areas of graphics beyond rendering proper: polarised light is currently being used in several other contexts, such as face scanning, highlight removal, or 3D projection technologies. Engineers and researchers in these other areas might benefit from the course insofar as the knowledge needed for an outright simulation of polarised light transport presented here is a superset of the information needed for more specialised tasks. This comprehensive overview would thus be a useful repository of knowledge for other areas as well.}, booktitle = {SIGGRAPH Asia 2011 Courses}, articleno = {8}, numpages = {36}, location = {Hong Kong, China}, series = {SA '11} }

abstract="3D shape reconstruction with multi-view stereo (MVS) relies on a robust evaluation of photo consistencies across images. The robustness is ensured by isolating surface albedo and scene illumination from the shape recovery, i.e. shading and colour variation are regarded as a nuisance in MVS. This yields a gap in the qualities between the recovered shape and the images used. We present a method to address it by jointly estimating detailed shape, illumination and albedo using the initial shape robustly recovered by MVS. This is achieved by solving the multi-view inverse rendering problem using the geometric and photometric smoothness terms and the normalized spherical harmonics illumination model. Our method allows spatially-varying albedo and per image illumination without any prerequisites such as training data or image segmentation. We demonstrate that our method can clearly improve the 3D shape and recover illumination and albedo on real world scenes.",

abstract = {The directional distribution of radiant flux reflected from roughened surfaces is analyzed on the basis of geometrical optics. The analytical model assumes that the surface consists of small, randomly disposed, mirror-like facets. Specular reflection from these facets plus a diffuse component due to multiple reflections and/or internal scattering are postulated as the basic mechanisms of the reflection process. The effects of shadowing and masking of facets by adjacent facets are included in the analysis. The angular distributions of reflected flux predicted by the analysis are in very good agreement with experiment for both metallic and nonmetallic surfaces. Moreover, the analysis successfully predicts the off-specular maxima in the reflection distribution which are observed experimentally and which emerge as the incidence angle increases. The model thus affords a rational explanation for the off-specular peak phenomenon in terms of mutual masking and shadowing of mirror-like, specularly reflecting surface facets.},

abstract = {Capturing appearance often requires dense sampling in light-view space, which is often achieved in specialized, expensive hardware setups. With the aim of realizing a compact acquisition setup without multiple angular samples of light and view, we sought to leverage an alternative optical property of light, polarization. To this end, we capture a set of polarimetric images with linear polarizers in front of a single projector and camera to obtain the appearance and normals of real-world objects. We encountered two technical challenges: First, no complete polarimetric BRDF model is available for modeling mixed polarization of both specular and diffuse reflection. Second, existing polarization-based inverse rendering methods are not applicable to a single local illumination setup since they are formulated with the assumption of spherical illumination. To this end, we first present a complete polarimetric BRDF (pBRDF) model that can define mixed polarization of both specular and diffuse reflection. Second, by leveraging our pBRDF model, we propose a novel inverse-rendering method with joint optimization of pBRDF and normals to capture spatially-varying material appearance: per-material specular properties (including the refractive index, specular roughness and specular coefficient), per-pixel diffuse albedo and normals. Our method can solve the severely ill-posed inverse-rendering problem by carefully accounting for the physical relationship between polarimetric appearance and geometric properties. We demonstrate how our method overcomes limited sampling in light-view space for inverse rendering by means of polarization.},

abstract = {A minimum of 16 measurements involving both linear and circularly polarized light are required to determine the {M}ueller matrix of a sample which completely describes the polarization properties of the sample. In contrast a 3×3 partial {M}ueller matrix, devoid of last row and column of conventional {M}ueller matrix, can be obtained by using nine linear polarization measurements. Further, with only linear polarization measurements the limitation on spectral coverage imposed by quarter wave plates required for circular polarization measurements is avoided. However, a drawback of this approach is that the data analysis tools developed for 4×4 {M}ueller matrix cannot be applied in this case. To address this issue we show that for non-depolarizing media the various symmetry constraints on Muller matrix elements can be used to obtain the 4×4 {M}ueller matrix from the measured 3×3 {M}ueller matrix. This method should prove particularly useful for measurement of {M}ueller matrix in the spectral region for which retarders are either not readily available or inconvenient to use.}

abstract = {In this work, the KAIST Mueller measurement database is compressed by assuming a triply degeneracy (TD) in the Cloude coherency eigenspectrum. This assumption compresses the database by a factor of two by reparameterizes the database into eight parameters, maintains physicality when interpolated for non-measured geometries, and is shown to retain the dominant polarimetric properties for both diffuse and specular light-matter interactions. For each 4 {\texttimes} 4 Mueller matrix, the 8 TD parameters are: the radiometric average throughput, a depolarization parameter, and 6 parameters to describe the dominant coherent process. Polarimetric importance sampling is made possible by interpreting the eigenspectrum as probabilities. To evaluate the proposed methods, a sphere is rendered using the pink silicone material from the KAIST pBRDF database and compared to a TD compressed and polarimetric importance sampled pBRDF rendering. The average deviation in the polarizance angle and degree of linear polarization (AoLP and DoLP) deviation was 16.9{\textdegree} and 1.1\% for both the TD compressed and polarimetric importance sampled pBRDF model as compared to the KAIST pBRDF model, respectively. The pBRDF models are also compared by rendering two scenes containing multiple surface interactions and several material types. Polarimetric importance sampling convergence and its dependence on the materials' depolarization and ray depth are reported for these scenes.},

The MM components are amplitude modulated onto spatial carrier frequencies which, due to the PGs, maintain high visibility in spectrally broadband illumination. An interference model of the SIMMP is provided, followed by methods of reconstruction and calibration. Lastly, a numerical simulation is used to demonstrate the system's performance in the presence of noise.},

This work demonstrates post-processing compressions of the full Mueller matrix that preserve detection performance. The purpose of this post-processing is to understand polarimetric measurement utility for computing mathematical observers and designing future imaging protocols. The detection performance of the full Mueller matrix, and both linear and non-linear parameters of the Mueller matrix will be compared. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, otherwise known as the AUC, is the gold standard metric to quantify detection performance in medical applications. An AUC $=$ 1 is perfect detection and AUC $=$ 0.5 is the performance of guessing. Either the scalar retardance or the 3 smallest eigenvalues of the coherency matrix yield an average AUC of 0.94 or 0.93, respectively. When these four non-linear parameters are used simultaneously the average AUC is 0.95. The J-optimal Channelized Quadratic Observer (J-CQO) method for optimizing polarimetric measurements demonstrates equivalent AUC values for the full Muller matrix and 6 J-CQO optimized measurements. The advantage of this optimization is that only 6 measurements, instead of 16 for the full Mueller matrix, are required to achieve this AUC.},

The introduction of polarization sensitive cameras with integrated wire-grid polarizers has allowed for the fast acquisition and analysis of four linear states within a single snapshot. Moreover, these cameras provide the opportunity to capture a reduced 3 × 4 Mueller matrix with the acquisition of generated states polarization in the illumination arm. In order to measure and characterize samples using a reduced 3 × 4 Mueller matrix, a 3 × 4 decomposition algorithm is introduced. This new algorithm is compared and validated against established 4 × 4 decompositions. The validation of this algorithm is shown using a previously reported Mueller matrix of polyacrylamide phantom, and experimental Mueller matrices of quarter-wave plates, silicone phantoms and a skin model sample. The 3 × 4 decomposition compares well to established decompositions and is capable of characterizing the samples based on the calculation of depolarization, retardance and orientation.}

abstract = {The polarization of light scattered by the surface of a material contains information that can be used to identify the sources of that scatter. Theories for light scattering from interfacial roughness of a dielectric layer and from defects in that dielectric layer are reviewed. Methods for calculating the Mueller matrix or the Stokes vector for scatter from multiple sources and for decomposing a Stokes vector into contributions from two nondepolarizing scattering sources are derived. The theories are evaluated for a specific sample and geometry. Results show that some incident polarizations are more effective than others at discriminating among scattering sources, with s-polarized light being least effective. The polarization of light scattered from interfacial roughness depends upon the relative roughness of the two interfaces and the degree of correlation between the two interfaces. The scattering from defects in the film depends on the depth of the defect and differs from that from any one of the cases of interfacial roughness. The scattering from defects randomly distributed in the film and for small dielectric permittivity variations in the film is also calculated. Experimental results are presented for a 52-nm SiO2 film thermally grown on microrough silicon.},

This optimization generalizes to multiple PSA/PSG pairs so that the classification performance as a function of number of polarimetric measurements can be considered. Optimizing PSA/PSG pairs gives insight into which polarimetric measurements are most useful for the binary classification. For example, in scenes with strong diattenuation, retardance, or depolarization certain PSA/PSG pairs would make two regions in an image look very similar and other pairs would make the regions look very different. The method presented in this paper provides a quantitative method for ensuring the images acquired can be classified optimally.},

The theoretical results are illustrated on an experimental example.},

abstract = {Mueller matrix polarimetric imaging has shown potential in tissue diagnosis but is challenging to implement endoscopically. In this work, a narrow band 3 {\texttimes} 3 Mueller matrix polarimetric endoscope was designed by rotating the endoscope to generate 0{\textdegree}, 45{\textdegree} and 90{\textdegree} linearly polarized illumination and positioning a rotating filter wheel in front of the camera containing three polarisers to permit polarization state analysis for backscattered light. The system was validated with a rotating linear polarizer and a diffuse reflection target. Initial measurements of 3 {\texttimes} 3 Mueller matrices on a rat are demonstrated, followed by matrix decomposition into the depolarization and retardance matrices for further analysis. Our work shows the feasibility of implementing polarimetric imaging in a rigid endoscope conveniently and economically in order to reveal diagnostic information.},

abstract = {The purpose of the present manuscript is to present a polarimetric bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model suitable for hyperspectral and polarimetric signature modelling. The model is based on a further development of a previously published four-parameter model that has been generalized in order to account for different types of surface structures (generalized Gaussian distribution). A generalization of the Lambertian diffuse model is presented. The pBRDF-functions are normalized using numerical integration. Using directional-hemispherical reflectance (DHR) measurements, three of the four basic parameters can be determined for any wavelength. This simplifies considerably the development of multispectral polarimetric BRDF applications. The scattering parameter has to be determined from at least one BRDF measurement. The model deals with linear polarized radiation; and in similarity with e.g. the facet model depolarization is not included. The model is very general and can inherently model extreme surfaces such as mirrors and Lambertian surfaces. The complex mixture of sources is described by the sum of two basic models, a generalized Gaussian/Fresnel model and a generalized Lambertian model. Although the physics inspired model has some ad hoc features, the predictive power of the model is impressive over a wide range of angles and scattering magnitudes. The model has been applied successfully to painted surfaces, both dull and glossy and also on metallic bead blasted surfaces. The simple and efficient model should be attractive for polarimetric simulations and polarimetric remote sensing.},
