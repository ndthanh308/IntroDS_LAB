\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}


We presented DCA, an algorithm to address disparity in outcomes of ranking processes using compensatory bonus points. We showed that DCA, by relying on a sampling-based approach, successfully reduces disparity in a wide range of settings, while being significantly more efficient than state-of-the-art approaches, running in sub-linear time. This makes DCA a good candidate for iterative processes that would allow users to identify the ranking function that best fits their needs while checking for its fairness impacts and the required compensatory bonus points.  


Our approach relies on the use of compensatory bonus points, a departure from previous work, which has mostly focused on modifying the ranking function directly, or on the use of quotas. A significant advantage of compensatory bonus points is that they are transparent, interpretable, and easily explainable to all stakeholders.
