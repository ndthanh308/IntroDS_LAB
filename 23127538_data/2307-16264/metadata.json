  "abstract": "Recent results in high-multiplicity pp collisions show features similar to those that are associated with the formation of a quark$-$gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions. Investigating the modification of the intra-jet properties as a function of event multiplicity in pp collisions can provide deeper insight into the nature of these effects. We will present the recent measurements of multiplicity dependence of charged-particle jet properties (average charged particle multiplicity and fragmentation functions) for leading charged-particle jets. Jets are reconstructed using anti-$k_{\\rm T}$ jet finding algorithm with radius parameter $R$ = 0.4 in the jet $p_{\\rm T}$ range from 5$-$110 GeV/$c$ at midrapidity in pp collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV with ALICE.",
