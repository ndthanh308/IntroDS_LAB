	abstract = "While most neural machine translation (NMT)systems are still trained using maximum likelihood estimation, recent work has demonstrated that optimizing systems to directly improve evaluation metrics such as BLEU can significantly improve final translation accuracy. However, training with BLEU has some limitations: it doesn{'}t assign partial credit, it has a limited range of output values, and it can penalize semantically correct hypotheses if they differ lexically from the reference. In this paper, we introduce an alternative reward function for optimizing NMT systems that is based on recent work in semantic similarity. We evaluate on four disparate languages trans-lated to English, and find that training with our proposed metric results in better translations as evaluated by BLEU, semantic similarity, and human evaluation, and also that the optimization procedure converges faster. Analysis suggests that this is because the proposed metric is more conducive to optimization, assigning partial credit and providing more diversity in scores than BLEU",

In this paper, we motivate the need for novel, system- and data-independent automatic evaluation methods: We investigate a wide range of metrics, including state-of-the-art word-based and novel grammar-based ones, and demonstrate that they only weakly reflect human judgements of system outputs as generated by data-driven, end-to-end NLG. We also show that metric performance is data- and system-specific. Nevertheless, our results also suggest that automatic metrics perform reliably at system-level and can support system development by finding cases where a system performs poorly.",

The principal problems that preclude the achievement of this potential are human factors issues. These issues are discussed, and the problems presented by icon-based interfaces are reviewed. An argument is offered that these issues, which ostensibly pertain to the blind or visually impaired user, are fundamental issues confronting all users. There is reason to hope that the benefits of research into the human factors issues of people with vision impairments will also extend to the sighted user.},

	abstract="``Change Impact Analysis'' is the process of determining the consequences of a modification to software. In theory, change impact analysis should be done during software maintenance, to make sure changes do not introduce new bugs. Many approaches and techniques are proposed to help programmers do change impact analysis automatically. However, it is still an open question whether and how programmers do change impact analysis. In this paper, we conducted two studies, one in-depth study and one breadth study. For the in-depth study, we recorded videos of nine professional programmers repairing two bugs for two hours. For the breadth study, we surveyed 35 professional programmers using an online system. We found that the programmers in our studies did static change impact analysis before they made changes by using IDE navigational functionalities, and they did dynamic change impact analysis after they made changes by running the programs. We also found that they did not use any change impact analysis tools.",

We collect a large dataset of 300K human-written stories paired with writing prompts from an online forum. Our dataset enables hierarchical story generation, where the model first generates a premise, and then transforms it into a passage of text. We gain further improvements with a novel form of model fusion that improves the relevance of the story to the prompt, and adding a new gated multi-scale self-attention mechanism to model long-range context. Experiments show large improvements over strong baselines on both automated and human evaluations. Human judges prefer stories generated by our approach to those from a strong non-hierarchical model by a factor of two to one.",
