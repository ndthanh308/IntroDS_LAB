\section{Conclusion}

This paper introduces a statement based approach to source code summarization using a memory network designed for the task. We provide a thorough evaluation on the potential of statement based approaches and memory networks to improve automated source code summarization. We show how our approach outperforms recent baselines using automated metrics suggested by the latest research literature. We investigated the subset of summaries that are most improved by our approach. We perform statistical tests for each of our results to test the significance of our results and reduce the risk of random differences in observation. We evaluated different configurations and design choices to arrive at the best performing configuration. We show how the best configuration outperform other possible design choices.

We conclude that both statement based approaches and memory networks can improve source code summarization in a way that is different from other approaches so far. We suggest multiple avenues for future work to explore how these techniques can be incorporated to improve the state-of-the-art.
