\begin{abstract}


Ontologies are known for their ability to organize rich metadata, support the identification of novel insights via semantic queries, and promote reuse. In this paper, we consider the problem of automated planning, where the objective is to find a sequence of actions that will move an agent from an initial state of the world to a desired goal state. We hypothesize that given a large number of available planners and diverse planning domains; they carry essential information that can be leveraged to identify suitable planners and improve their performance for a domain. We use data on planning domains and planners from the International Planning Competition (IPC) to construct a planning ontology and demonstrate via experiments in two use cases that the ontology can lead to the selection of promising planners and improving their performance using macros - a form of action ordering constraints extracted from planning ontology. We also make the planning ontology and associated resources available to the community to promote further research. 

    % Automating planning and decision-making tasks is a fundamental goal of artificial intelligence (AI) research. The vast number of available planners and diverse planning domains carry essential information that can be leveraged to improve planner performance. For instance, by analyzing the performance of different planners on various problem configurations, we can identify which planners excel in particular domains and improve their efficiency.  To address this issue, we propose a novel approach that employs an ontology to represent the characteristics of planning domains and the capabilities of planners. We gather data on planning domains and planners from the International Planning Competition (IPC) to construct the ontology. Our ontology for AI planning captures critical parameters relevant to planning, including the best planners for a given problem configuration, the ranking of relevant heuristics, and macros to aid in solving complex problems. The ontology represents planning resources, enabling their reuse and improving planner performance.
    
    % Automating planning and decision-making tasks has been a long-standing goal in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). However, selecting the best-performing planner for a given planning domain remains a challenge due to the vast number of available planners and the diversity of planning domains. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that uses an ontology to represent the features of the planning domain and the capabilities of planners. We use the International Planning Competition (IPC) and planner information to collect data on the domain and planners and use this data to construct our ontological.
