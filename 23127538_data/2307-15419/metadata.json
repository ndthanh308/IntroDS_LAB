  "abstract": "An updated global fit on the parameter-space of the Aligned Two-Higgs-Doublet model has been performed with the help of the open-source package HEPfit, assuming the Standard-Model Higgs to be the lightest scalar. No new sources of CP violation, other than the phase in the CKM matrix of the Standard Model, have been considered. A similar global fit was previously performed in Ref. [JHEP 05 (2021) 005] with a slightly different set of parameters. Our updated fit incorporates improved analyses of the theoretical constraints required for perturbative unitarity and boundedness of the scalar potential from below, additional flavour observables and updated data on direct searches of heavy scalars at the LHC, Higgs signal strengths and electroweak precision observables. Although not included in the main fit, the implications of the CDF measurement of the $W^\\pm$ mass are also discussed.",
