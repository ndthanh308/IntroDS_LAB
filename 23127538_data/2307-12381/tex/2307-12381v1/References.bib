	abstract = {Recently, intensely driven laser-matter interactions have been used to connect the fields of strong laser field physics with quantum optics by generating nonclassical states of light. Here, we take a further key step and show the potential of strong laser fields for generating controllable high-photon-number coherent-state superpositions. This has been achieved by using two of the most prominent strong-laser induced processes: high-harmonic generation and above-threshold ionization. We show how the obtained coherent-state superpositions change from an optical Schrödinger “cat” state to a “kitten” state by changing the atomic density in the laser-atom interaction region, and we demonstrate the generation of a nine-photon shifted optical “cat” state, which, to our knowledge, is the highest photon number optical “cat” state experimentally reported. Our findings anticipate the development of new methods that naturally lead to the creation of high-photon-number controllable coherent-state superpositions, advancing investigations in quantum technology.},

	abstract = {Emission of high-order harmonics from solids provides a new avenue in attosecond science. On the one hand, it allows us to investigate fundamental processes of the nonlinear response of electrons driven by a strong laser pulse in a periodic crystal lattice. On the other hand, it opens new paths toward efficient attosecond pulse generation, novel imaging of electronic wave functions, and enhancement of high-order harmonic-generation (HHG) intensity. A key feature of HHG in a solid (as compared to the well-understood phenomenon of HHG in an atomic gas) is the delocalization of the process, whereby an electron ionized from one site in the periodic lattice may recombine in any other. Here, we develop an analytic model, based on the localized Wannier wave functions in the valence band and delocalized Bloch functions in the conduction band. This Wannier-Bloch approach assesses the contributions of individual lattice sites to the HHG process and hence precisely addresses the question of localization of harmonic emission in solids. We apply this model to investigate HHG in a ZnO crystal for two different orientations, corresponding to wider and narrower valence and conduction bands, respectively. Interestingly, for narrower bands, the HHG process shows significant localization, similar to harmonic generation in atoms. For all cases, the delocalized contributions to HHG emission are highest near the band-gap energy. Our results pave the way to controlling localized contributions to HHG in a solid crystal.},

The theory is valid for arbitrary atomic potentials and can be generalized to describe laser fields of arbitrary ellipticity and spectrum. We discuss the role of atomic dipole matrix elements, electron rescattering processes, and of depletion of the ground state. We present the exact quantum-mechanical formula for the harmonic cutoff that differs from the phenomenological law Ip+3.17Up, where Ip is the atomic ionization potential and Up is the ponderomotive energy, due to the account for quantum tunneling and diffusion effects., This article appears in the following collection:},

	abstract = {This paper has been prepared by the Symphony collaboration (University of Warsaw, Uniwersytet Jagielloński, DESY/CNR and ICFO) on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of the ‘simple man’s models’ which underlie most of the phenomena that occur when intense ultrashort laser pulses interact with matter. The phenomena in question include high-harmonic generation (HHG), above-threshold ionization (ATI), and non-sequential multielectron ionization (NSMI). ‘Simple man’s models’ provide both an intuitive basis for understanding the numerical solutions of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation and the motivation for the powerful analytic approximations generally known as the strong field approximation (SFA). In this paper we first review the SFA in the form developed by us in the last 25 years. In this approach the SFA is a method to solve the TDSE, in which the non-perturbative interactions are described by including continuum–continuum interactions in a systematic perturbation-like theory. In this review we focus on recent applications of the SFA to HHG, ATI and NSMI from multi-electron atoms and from multi-atom molecules. The main novel part of the presented theory concerns generalizations of the SFA to: (i) time-dependent treatment of two-electron atoms, allowing for studies of an interplay between electron impact ionization and resonant excitation with subsequent ionization; (ii) time-dependent treatment in the single active electron approximation of ‘large’ molecules and targets which are themselves undergoing dynamics during the HHG or ATI processes. In particular, we formulate the general expressions for the case of arbitrary molecules, combining input from quantum chemistry and quantum dynamics. We formulate also theory of time-dependent separable molecular potentials to model analytically the dynamics of realistic electronic wave packets for molecules in strong laser fields. We dedicate this work to the memory of Bertrand Carré, who passed away in March 2018 at the age of 60.},

However, the quantum nature of the electromagnetic fields is always present3. Here we demonstrate that intense laser–atom interactions may lead to the generation of highly non-classical light states. This was achieved by using the process of high-harmonic generation in atoms4,5, in which the photons of a driving laser pulse of infrared frequency are upconverted into photons of higher frequencies in the extreme ultraviolet spectral range. The quantum state of the fundamental mode after the interaction, when conditioned on the high-harmonic generation, is a so-called Schrödinger cat state, which corresponds to a superposition of two distinct coherent states: the initial state of the laser and the coherent state reduced in amplitude that results from the interaction with atoms. The results open the path for investigations towards the control of the non-classical states, exploiting conditioning approaches on physical processes relevant to high-harmonic generation.},

Although the majority of these studies have been successfully described using classical electromagnetic fields, recent investigations based on fully quantized approaches have shown that intense laser-atom interactions can be used for the generation of controllable high-photon-number entangled coherent states and coherent state superpositions. In this tutorial, we provide a comprehensive fully quantized description of intense laser-atom interactions. We elaborate on the processes of high-harmonic generation, above-threshold ionization, and we discuss new phenomena that cannot be revealed within the context of semiclassical theories. We provide the description for conditioning the light field on different electronic processes, and their consequences for quantum state engineering of light.

A new phenomenon involving the dynamic localization of the moving particle is shown to result in the case of a sinusoidally varying field: The particle is generally delocalized except for the cases when the ratio of the field magnitude and the field frequency is a root of the ordinary Bessel function of order 0.

	abstract = {Invertible local transformations of a multipartite system are used to define equivalence classes in the set of entangled states. This classification concerns the entanglement properties of a single copy of the state. Accordingly, we say that two states have the same kind of entanglement if both of them can be obtained from the other by means of local operations and classical communication (LOCC) with nonzero probability. When applied to pure states of a three-qubit system, this approach reveals the existence of two inequivalent kinds of genuine tripartite entanglement, for which the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state and a W state appear as remarkable representatives. In particular, we show that the W state retains maximally bipartite entanglement when any one of the three qubits is traced out. We generalize our results both to the case of higher-dimensional subsystems and also to more than three subsystems, for all of which we show that, typically, two randomly chosen pure states cannot be converted into each other by means of LOCC, not even with a small probability of success., This article appears in the following collection:},

Exploring ways to approach those frontiers requires insight into the physics underlying the interaction of strong high-frequency (optical) fields with electrons moving in periodic potentials. This Colloquium aims at providing this insight. Introduction to the foundations of strong-field phenomena defines and compares regimes of field-matter interaction in periodic systems, including (perfect) crystals as well as optical and semiconductor superlattices, followed by a review of recent experimental advances in the study of strong-field dynamics in crystals and nanostructures.

Since the first experiments and theoretical developments, there has been a constant and steady interest in this topic. In this paper, we summarize the progress made so far and propose new possibilities for the generation of high-order harmonics with the aid of plasmonic fields. The driven fields could be adequately engineered both spatially and temporally with nanometric and attosecond resolution, offering to the conventional solid-HHG novel and exciting coherent sources. Just to cite an example, the generation of attosecond pulses using bulk matter is strongly linked to the appropriate manipulation of the driven field to avoid, for instance, reaching the damage threshold of the material. Plasmonics fields as an alternative to conventional laser beams could open new avenues in the development of table-top sources of ultrashort and strong coherent radiation.},

Since then, measurement and control of the subcycle field evolution of few-cycle light have opened the door to a radically new approach to exploring and controlling processes of the microcosm. The hyperfast-varying electric field of visible light permitted manipulation and tracking of the atomic-scale motion of electrons. Striking implications include controlled generation and measurement of single attosecond pulses of extreme ultraviolet light as well as trains of them, and real-time observation of atomic-scale electron dynamics. The tools and techniques for steering and tracing electronic motion in atoms, molecules, and nanostructures are now becoming available, marking the birth of attosecond physics.

Phase-matched high harmonics by a loosely focusing geometry produce highly focusable intensity with fully spatiotemporal coherence, which is sufficient to induce nonlinear optical phenomena in the extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray (XUV) region where no intense coherent sources had previously existed. Observation of two-photon double ionization as well as two-photon above-threshold ionization in He is demonstrated with 42-eV high-harmonic photons. These nonlinear processes allow us to measure directly the temporal shapes of XUV high-harmonic pulses of which duration should be shorter than 1fs. By combining intensity autocorrelation and photoelectron spectroscopy in two-photon above threshold ionization in Ar, temporal characterization of a train of attosecond pulses is achieved. On the other hand, when intense high harmonics around 20eV is subjected to N2 molecules, occurrence of Coulomb explosion following two-photon double ionization is observed in attosecond temporal precision. Taking advantage of larger cross section of two-photon ionization in molecules, we successfully perform the interferometric autocorrelation of an attosecond pulse train with the ion signals produced by Coulomb explosion of nitrogen molecules. The result reveals the phase relation between attosecond pulses in the train.},

While femtosecond (fs) pulses are successfully used to investigate vibrational dynamics in molecular systems, real time observation of electron motion in all states of matter requires temporal resolution in the attosecond (1 attosecond (asec) = 10−18 s) time scale. During the last decades, continuous efforts in ultra-short pulse engineering led to the development of table-top sources which can produce asec pulses. These pulses have been synthesized by using broadband coherent radiation in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) spectral region generated by the interaction of matter with intense fs pulses. Here, we will review asec pulses generated by the interaction of gas phase media and solid surfaces with intense fs IR laser fields. After a brief overview of the fundamental process underlying the XUV emission form these media, we will review the current technology, specifications and the ongoing developments of such asec sources.},

Conventional models of HHG that treat the driving and emitted fields classically are usually very successful but inherently cannot capture the quantum-optical nature of the process. Although prior work considered quantum HHG, it remains unknown in what conditions the spectral and statistical properties of the radiation depart considerably from the known phenomenology of HHG. The discovery of such conditions could lead to novel sources of attosecond light having squeezing and entanglement. Here, we present a fully-quantum theory of extreme nonlinear optics, predicting quantum effects that alter both the spectrum and photon statistics of HHG, thus departing from all previous approaches. We predict the emission of shifted frequency combs and identify spectral features arising from the breakdown of the dipole approximation for the emission. Our results show that each frequency component of HHG can be bunched and squeezed and that each emitted photon is a superposition of all frequencies in the spectrum, i.e., each photon is a comb. Our general approach is applicable to a wide range of nonlinear optical processes, paving the way towards novel quantum phenomena in extreme nonlinear optics.},

	abstract = {Interactions between light and matter play an instrumental role in spectroscopy, sensing, quantum information processing and lasers. In most of these applications, light is considered in terms of electromagnetic plane waves propagating at the speed of light in vacuum. As a result, light–matter interactions can usually be treated as very weak and captured at the lowest order in quantum electrodynamics. However, progress in understanding the coupling of photons to material quasiparticles (plasmons, phonons and excitons) brings the need for a generalized view of the photon at the core of every light–matter interaction. In this new picture, the photon can have greatly different polarization and dispersion and be confined to the scale of a few nanometres. Such photonic quasiparticles enable a wealth of otherwise unobservable light–matter interaction phenomena, in interactions with both bound and free electrons. This Review focuses on the theoretical and experimental developments in realizing new light–matter interactions with photonic quasiparticles. Examples include room-temperature strong coupling, ultrafast ‘forbidden’ transitions in atoms and new applications of the Cherenkov effect, as well as breakthroughs in ultrafast electron microscopy and new concepts for compact X-ray sources.},

	abstract = {The interaction of electrons with strong laser fields is usually treated with semiclassical theory, where the laser is represented by an external field. There are analytic solutions for the free electron wave functions, which incorporate the interaction with the laser field exactly, but the joint effect of the atomic binding potential presents an obstacle for the analysis. Moreover, the radiation is a dynamical system, the number of photons changes during the interactions. Thus, it is legitimate to ask how can one treat the high order processes nonperturbatively, in such a way that the electron-atom interaction and the quantized nature of radiation be simultaneously taken into account? An analytic method is proposed to answer this question in the framework of nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics. As an application, a quantum optical generalization of the strong-field Kramers-Heisenberg formula is derived for describing high-harmonic generation. Our formalism is suitable to analyse, among various quantal effects, the possible role of arbitrary photon statistics of the incoming field. The present paper is dedicated to the memory of Prof. Dr. Fritz Ehlotzky, who had significantly contributed to the theory of strong-field phenomena over many decades.},

While the material system is extremely simplified in this description, the conclusions and the methods may be generalized for more complex cases. Our primary interest is an effective model of HHG in which the exciting pulse is classical and the harmonics are quantized, although we touch upon the more generalized, fully quantized model as well. Evolution of the Mandel parameter, photon antibunching, squeezing, and cross correlations are calculated. Results imply that with respect to a single quantized emitter, nonclassicality of the harmonics is present: sub-Poissonian photon statistic and squeezing can characterize certain optical modes, while strong anticorrelation can also be present.},

	abstract = {Strongly driven systems of emitters offer an attractive source of light over broad spectral ranges up to the X-ray region. A key limitation of these systems is that the light they emit is for the most part classical. We challenge this paradigm by building a quantum-optical theory of strongly driven many-body systems, showing that the presence of correlations among the emitters creates emission of nonclassical many-photon states of light. We consider the example of high-harmonic generation (HHG), by which a strongly driven system emits photons at integer multiples of the drive frequency. In the conventional case of uncorrelated emitters, the harmonics are in an almost perfectly multi-mode coherent state lacking any correlation between harmonics. By contrast, a correlation of the emitters prior to the strong drive is converted onto nonclassical features of the output light, including doubly-peaked photon statistics, ring-shaped Wigner functions, and quantum correlations between harmonics. We propose schemes for implementing these concepts, creating the correlations between emitters via an interaction between them or their joint interaction with the background electromagnetic field (as in superradiance). By tuning the time at which these processes are interrupted by the strong drive, one can control the amount of correlations between the emitters, and correspondingly the deviation of the emitted light from a classical state. Our work paves the way towards the engineering of novel many-photon states of light over a broadband spectrum of frequencies, and suggests HHG as a diagnostic tool for characterizing correlations in many-body systems with attosecond temporal resolution.},

In the majority of these studies the harmonic generation process is described using semi-classical theories which treat the electromagnetic field of the driving laser pulse classically without taking into account its quantum nature. In addition, for the measurement of the generated harmonics, all the experiments require diagnostics in the extreme-ultraviolet spectral region. Here by treating the driving laser field quantum mechanically we reveal the quantum-optical nature of the high-order harmonic generation process by measuring the photon number distribution of the infrared light exiting the harmonic generation medium.

	abstract = {We study the generation of high-harmonic radiation by Bloch electrons in a model transparent solid driven by a strong midinfrared laser field. We solve the single-electron time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE) using a velocity-gauge method [M. Korbman et al., New J. Phys. 15, 013006 (2013)] that is numerically stable as the laser intensity and number of energy bands are increased. The resulting harmonic spectrum exhibits a primary plateau due to the coupling of the valence band to the first conduction band, with a cutoff energy that scales linearly with field strength and laser wavelength. We also find a weaker second plateau due to coupling to higher-lying conduction bands, with a cutoff that is also approximately linear in the field strength. To facilitate the analysis of the time-frequency characteristics of the emitted harmonics, we also solve the TDSE in a time-dependent basis set, the Houston states [J. B. Krieger and G. J. Iafrate, Phys. Rev. B 33, 5494 (1986)], which allows us to separate interband and intraband contributions to the time-dependent current. We find that the interband and intraband contributions display very different time-frequency characteristics. We show that solutions in these two bases are equivalent under a unitary transformation but that, unlike the velocity-gauge method, the Houston state treatment is numerically unstable when more than a few low-lying energy bands are used.},

Utilizing this framework, we first discovered that the diabatic processes, namely, ac Zener tunneling and semimetallization of semiconductors, are key factors for nonperturbative mechanisms of HHG. These mechanisms are classified by the field intensity and could be understood by an extended simple man model based on an analogy between tunnel ionization in gaseous media and Zener tunneling in semiconductors.

The ERM illuminates the distinct spectrotemporal characteristics of harmonics emitted parallel and perpendicularly to the laser polarization direction. Imperfect recollisions are a general phenomenon and a manifestation of the spatially delocalized nature of the real-space wave packet; they arise naturally in systems with large Berry curvatures, or in any system driven by elliptically polarized light.},

At grazing incidence, a clear double-plateau structure is observed in the harmonic spectrum. The photon energy of the second plateau far beyond atomiclike harmonics can be well explained by the inclusion of backscattering of ionized electrons. Ab initio simulations reveal that the cutoff of the second plateau is continuously extended with an increasing d. Our classical calculations predict that the maximum electronic kinetic energy is linearly dependent on d over a wide range. Moreover, the harmonic yield in the second plateau is significantly enhanced by increases in the wavelength of the driving laser. Owing to the confined spreading of the electronic wave packet, a beneficial wavelength scaling of λ2.85 is obtained. This study therefore establishes an efficient way of producing high-energy photon source based on layered nanostructures.},

While current ab initio algorithms are powerful in calculating band structures of solids, they all introduced random phases into the eigenfunctions at each crystal momentum k . Here we show how to choose a “smooth-periodic” gauge where TDMs can be smooth versus k , preserving crystal symmetry, as well as maintaining periodic at boundaries. The symmetry properties of TDMs with respect to k ensure the absence of even-order harmonics from MgO with inversion symmetry, while the TDM in the “smooth-periodic” gauge for broken-symmetry ZnO is responsible for even harmonics that were underestimated in previous simulations. These results reveal the importance of correctly treating the complex TDMs that satisfy crystal symmetry and continuous across zone boundaries in nonlinear laser-solid interactions, which has been elusive in most theories so far.},

A one-dimensional two-band model, combined with a linear coupled excitation model, is shown to be able to explain the observed polarization behavior, including low-order harmonics. We further note that the same odd/even order contrast have been reported in a number of other crystals, despite that the harmonics were perceived to be generated via entirely different mechanisms. We demonstrated that this universality is governed by crystal symmetry, not by specific mechanisms. Thus, polarization measurements of harmonics offers a powerful pure optical method for determining the crystal axes as well as monitoring their ultrafast changes when crystals are undergoing deformation. In addition, the ellipticity of harmonic has been studied. It shows that ellipticity of high-order harmonics from solids can be tuned precisely by changing the bond structure of the sample.},

When the crystal has inversion symmetry, or reflection symmetry with the symmetry plane perpendicular to the laser polarization direction, the TDP can be neglected. Without such symmetry, however, the TDP will lead to the appearance of even harmonics. We further show that the TDP is sensitive to the crystal geometry.

The calculated results show that harmonic conversion efficiency is significantly enhanced and the cutoff energy is distinctly increased when the dipole moments change greatly along a valley in the k direction in the solid. Based on that dependence on the dipole moment, we also show that symmetry groups greatly affect the harmonic spectra from the solid materials.

	abstract = {The electronic ground state of a periodic system is usually described in terms of extended Bloch orbitals, but an alternative representation in terms of localized “Wannier functions” was introduced by Gregory Wannier in 1937. The connection between the Bloch and Wannier representations is realized by families of transformations in a continuous space of unitary matrices, carrying a large degree of arbitrariness. Since 1997, methods have been developed that allow one to iteratively transform the extended Bloch orbitals of a first-principles calculation into a unique set of maximally localized Wannier functions, accomplishing the solid-state equivalent of constructing localized molecular orbitals, or “Boys orbitals” as previously known from the chemistry literature. These developments are reviewed here, and a survey of the applications of these methods is presented. This latter includes a description of their use in analyzing the nature of chemical bonding, or as a local probe of phenomena related to electric polarization and orbital magnetization. Wannier interpolation schemes are also reviewed, by which quantities computed on a coarse reciprocal-space mesh can be used to interpolate onto much finer meshes at low cost, and applications in which Wannier functions are used as efficient basis functions are discussed. Finally the construction and use of Wannier functions outside the context of electronic-structure theory is presented, for cases that include phonon excitations, photonic crystals, and cold-atom optical lattices.},

	abstract = {For the high-order harmonic generation (HHG) from solids, the dephasing process induced by many-body interactions has been discussed extensively in the studies of using the semiconductor Bloch equations (SBEs). However, the role of dephasing in solid HHG is always ignored in the simulations of using a time-dependent Schrödinger equation under the independent electron approximation. To solve this problem, we introduce the imaginary potential to phenomenologically depict the dephasing process in the solid HHG. Compared with the results of experiment and SBEs, the validity of this approach has been verified by the laser intensity- and wavelength-dependent HHG spectra. Diffusion of the quantum wave packet controls the time-frequency characteristic in solid HHG. To obtain semiclassical trajectories whose predictions are consistent with the quantum simulations, we propose an open-trajectory model by relaxing the zero displacement condition in the tunneling and recollision steps. In addition, the quantum decoherence adjusts the chirp of the emission time profile via modulating the coherent overlap between recombined wave packets, which further paves a way to generate an attosecond pulse from solids and probe the dephasing time via the high-harmonic spectroscopy.},

Experimental detection of topological invariants is thus in great demand but remains extremely challenging. Ultrafast laser-matter interactions, and in particular high-harmonic generation, meanwhile, were proposed several years ago as tools to explore the structural and dynamical properties of various matter targets. Here we show that the high-harmonic emission signal produced by a circularly polarized laser contains signatures of topological phases and transitions in the paradigmatic Haldane model. In addition to clear shifts of the overall emissivity and harmonic cutoff, the high-harmonic emission shows a unique circular dichroism, which exhibits clear changes in behavior at the topological phase boundary. Our findings pave the way to understand fundamental questions about the ultrafast electron-hole pair dynamics in topological materials via nonlinear high-harmonic generation spectroscopy.},

This paves the way to an effective simulation of the DCE through a mechanism that has recently found experimental demonstration. The spectral properties of the emitted radiation reflect the critical nature of the system and allow us to link the detection of the DCE to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism for the production of defects when crossing a continuous phase transition.},

	abstract = {The semiconductor ZnO has gained substantial interest in the research community in part because of its large exciton binding energy (60meV) which could lead to lasing action based on exciton recombination even above room temperature. Even though research focusing on ZnO goes back many decades, the renewed interest is fueled by availability of high-quality substrates and reports of p-type conduction and ferromagnetic behavior when doped with transitions metals, both of which remain controversial. It is this renewed interest in ZnO which forms the basis of this review. As mentioned already, ZnO is not new to the semiconductor field, with studies of its lattice parameter dating back to 1935 by Bunn [Proc. Phys. Soc. London 47, 836 (1935)], studies of its vibrational properties with Raman scattering in 1966 by Damen et al. [Phys. Rev. 142, 570 (1966)], detailed optical studies in 1954 by Mollwo [Z. Angew. Phys. 6, 257 (1954)], and its growth by chemical-vapor transport in 1970 by Galli and Coker [Appl. Phys. Lett. 16, 439 (1970)]. In terms of devices, Au Schottky barriers in 1965 by Mead [Phys. Lett. 18, 218 (1965)], demonstration of light-emitting diodes (1967) by Drapak [Semiconductors 2, 624 (1968)], in which Cu2O was used as the p-type material, metal-insulator-semiconductor structures (1974) by Minami et al. [Jpn. J. Appl. Phys. 13, 1475 (1974)], ZnO∕ZnSe n-p junctions (1975) by Tsurkan et al. [Semiconductors 6, 1183 (1975)], and Al∕Au Ohmic contacts by Brillson [J. Vac. Sci. Technol. 15, 1378 (1978)] were attained. The main obstacle to the development of ZnO has been the lack of reproducible and low-resistivity p-type ZnO, as recently discussed by Look and Claflin [Phys. Status Solidi B 241, 624 (2004)]. While ZnO already has many industrial applications owing to its piezoelectric properties and band gap in the near ultraviolet, its applications to optoelectronic devices has not yet materialized due chiefly to the lack of p-type epitaxial layers. Very high quality what used to be called whiskers and platelets, the nomenclature for which gave way to nanostructures of late, have been prepared early on and used to deduce much of the principal properties of this material, particularly in terms of optical processes. The suggestion of attainment of p-type conductivity in the last few years has rekindled the long-time, albeit dormant, fervor of exploiting this material for optoelectronic applications. The attraction can simply be attributed to the large exciton binding energy of 60meV of ZnO potentially paving the way for efficient room-temperature exciton-based emitters, and sharp transitions facilitating very low threshold semiconductor lasers. The field is also fueled by theoretical predictions and perhaps experimental confirmation of ferromagnetism at room temperature for potential spintronics applications. This review gives an in-depth discussion of the mechanical, chemical, electrical, and optical properties of ZnO in addition to the technological issues such as growth, defects, p-type doping, band-gap engineering, devices, and nanostructures.},

Then some of the most prominent applications ofNon-classical light non-classical light are reviewed. After that, as the principal part of our discourse, we review the most common sources ofNon-classical light non-classical light. We will find them surprisingly diverse, including physical systems of various sizes and complexity, ranging from single atoms to optical crystals and to semiconductor lasers. Putting all these dissimilar optical devices in the common perspective we attempt to establish a trend in the field and to foresee the new cross-disciplinary approaches and techniques of generatingNon-classical light non-classical light.},

Here, using a full quantum-optical approach, we demonstrate that the subcycle electronic response in a strongly driven semiconductor crystal is imprinted in the quantum state of the driving field resulting in nonclassical light states carrying the information of the interaction.

Our previous work showed that in lossy channels the teleportation of DV qubits, via CV-entangled states, can be significantly improved by a new protocol defined by a modified Bell state measurement at the sender. This work explores whether a new, similarly modified, CV-based teleportation protocol can lead to improvement in the transfer of hybrid entangled states. To set the scene, we first determine the performance of such a modified protocol in teleporting CV-only qubits, showing that significant improvement over traditional CV-based teleportation is obtained. We then explore similar modifications in the teleportation of a specific hybrid entangled state showing that significant improvement over traditional CV-based teleportation is again found. For a given channel loss, we find teleporting the DV qubit of the hybrid entangled state can always achieve higher fidelity than teleporting the CV qubit. We then explore the use of various non-Gaussian operations in our modified teleportation protocol, finding that, at a cost of lower success probability, quantum scissors provides the most improvement in the loss tolerance. Our new results emphasize that in lossy conditions, the quantum measurements undertaken at the sender can have a surprising and dramatic impact on CV-based teleportation.},

Here we present an experimental system that enables for DIQKD between two distant users. The experiment is based on the generation and analysis of event-ready entanglement between two independently trapped single rubidium atoms located in buildings 400 metre apart14. By achieving an entanglement fidelity of \$\$ \{{\textbackslash}mathcal F\} {\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}ge 0.892(23)\$\$and implementing a DIQKD protocol with random key basis15, we observe a significant violation of a Bell inequality of S = 2.578(75)—above the classical limit of 2—and a quantum bit error rate of only 0.078(9). For the protocol, this results in a secret key rate of 0.07 bits per entanglement generation event in the asymptotic limit, and thus demonstrates the system’s capability to generate secret keys. Our results of secure key exchange with potentially untrusted devices pave the way to the ultimate form of quantum secure communications in future quantum networks.},

Since in solid-state systems the recombination of the electron can be delocalized along the material, the final state of the electron determines how the electromagnetic field gets affected because of the laser-matter interaction, leading to the generation of entanglement between the electron and the field. These features can be enhanced by applying conditioning operations, i.e., quantum operations based on the measurement of high-harmonic radiation. We study non-classical features present in the final quantum optical state, and characterize the amount of entanglement between the light and the electrons in the solid. The work sets the foundation for the development of compact solid-state-based non-classical light sources using strong-field physics.},

The study is based on the backaction of the ATI process on the quantum optical state of the system, and its dependence on the kinetic energy and direction of the emitted photoelectrons. Taking into account the dynamics of the process, we demonstrate the creation of hybrid entangled states. The amount of entanglement has been studied in terms of the entropy of entanglement.

There are two approaches to defining entanglement measures: the axiomatic and the operational one. The chapter discusses these two approaches. Next, it describes important classes of multipartite quantum states that admit an efficient classical description - including matrix product states, stabilizer states, and bosonic and fermionic Gaussian states - and sketches their roles in quantum information theory.

Both EE and EI have a strong influence on the overall intensity of the MHOHG spectrum, and there may be four orders of magnitude difference in the MHOHG intensity between the enhanced and suppressed cases.

It configures an invaluable tool to produce attosecond pulses, moreover, to extract electron structural and dynamical information of the target, i.e., atoms, molecules, and solids. In this contribution, we introduce an analytical description of atomic and molecular HHG, that extends the well-established theoretical strong-field approximation (SFA). Our approach involves two innovative aspects: (i) First, the bound-continuum and rescattering matrix elements can be analytically computed for both atomic and multicenter molecular systems, using a nonlocal short range model, but separable, potential. When compared with the standard models, these analytical derivations make possible to directly examine how the HHG spectra depend on the driven media and laser-pulse features. Furthermore, we can turn on and off contributions having distinct physical origins or corresponding to different mechanisms. This allows us to quantify their importance in the various regions of the HHG spectra. (ii) Second, as reported recently [N. Suárez et al., Phys. Rev. A 94, 043423 (2016)], the multicenter matrix elements in our theory are free from nonphysical gauge- and coordinate-system-dependent terms; this is accomplished by adapting the coordinate system to the center from which the corresponding time-dependent wave function originates. Our SFA results are contrasted, when possible, with the direct numerical integration of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation in reduced and full dimensionality. Very good agreement is found for single and multielectronic atomic systems, modeled under the single active electron approximation, and for simple diatomic molecular systems. Interference features, ubiquitously present in every strong-field phenomenon involving a multicenter target, are also captured by our model.},

As the internuclear distance is increased, the minimum first shifts in position compared with the prediction of the two-center interference model and subsequently disappears. These effects are caused by the excited 2Σ+u (2pσu) state, partly due to the interference between the amplitudes of recombination to the ground and excited states, but also partly due to the signal associated with recombination to the excited state alone. We find that at internuclear distances beyond R≃3 a.u. the signal close to the harmonic cutoff may be completely dominated by recombination into the excited 2Σ+u (2pσu) state.},

On the other hand, quantum optics has been built on the use of low photon number sources and has opened the way for groundbreaking discoveries in quantum technology, advancing investigations ranging from fundamental tests of quantum theory to quantum information processing. Despite the tremendous progress, until recently these directions have remained disconnected. This is because, the majority of the interactions in the strong-field limit have been successfully described by semi-classical approximations treating the electromagnetic field classically, as there was no need to include the quantum properties of the field to explain the observations. The link between strong laser physics, quantum optics, and quantum information science has been developed in the recent past. Studies based on fully quantized and conditioning approaches have shown that intense laser--matter interactions can be used for the generation of controllable entangled and non-classical light states. This achievement opens the way for a vast number of investigations stemming from the symbiosis of strong laser physics, quantum optics, and quantum information science. Here, after an introduction to the fundamentals of these research directions, we report on the recent progress in the fully quantized description of intense laser--matter interaction and the methods that have been developed for the generation of non-classical light states and entangled states. Also, we discuss the future directions of non-classical light engineering using strong laser fields, and the potential applications in ultrafast and quantum information science.},

	abstract = {Multi-level (qudit) entangled photon states are a key resource for both fundamental physics and advanced applied science, as they can significantly boost the capabilities of novel technologies such as quantum communications, cryptography, sensing, metrology, and computing. The benefits of using photons for advanced applications draw on their unique properties: photons can propagate over long distances while preserving state coherence, and they possess multiple degrees of freedom (such as time and frequency) that allow scalable access to higher dimensional state encoding, all while maintaining low platform footprint and complexity. In the context of out-of-lab use, photon generation and processing through integrated devices and off-the-shelf components are in high demand. Similarly, multi-level entanglement detection must be experimentally practical, i.e., ideally requiring feasible single-qudit projections and high noise tolerance. Here, we focus on multi-level optical Bell and cluster states as a critical resource for quantum technologies, as well as on universal witness operators for their feasible detection and entanglement characterization. Time- and frequency-entangled states are the main platform considered in this context. We review a promising approach for the scalable, cost-effective generation and processing of these states by using integrated quantum frequency combs and fiber-based devices, respectively. We finally report an experimentally practical entanglement identification and characterization technique based on witness operators that is valid for any complex photon state and provides a good compromise between experimental feasibility and noise robustness. The results reported here can pave the way toward boosting the implementation of quantum technologies in integrated and widely accessible photonic platforms.},

The harmonic emission strengths, first decrease rather steeply for the first orders, then form a long plateau up to the 21st harmonic in xenon, or up to the 33rd harmonic in argon, before decreasing again rather abruptly. The theoretical description of these experiments consists first in the calculation of the photoemission spectra emitted by a single atom. The spectra are obtained by numerically integrating a time dependent Schrodinger equation for the laser-excited rare-gas atom. Second, one must account for collective effects in the medium, described by Maxwell's equations. A theoretical framework for describing the generation and propagation of harmonics in strong laser fields is developed. An numerical solution of the propagation equations for the harmonic fields in xenon at 1064 nm provides results which agree well with experimental data.},

Aligned molecules7,8,9,10,11 can be used to study quantum phenomena in HHG associated with molecular symmetries; in particular, simultaneous observations of both ion yields and harmonic signals under the same conditions serve to disentangle the contributions from the ionization and recombination processes. Here we report evidence for quantum interference of electron de Broglie waves12,13,14 in the recombination process of HHG from aligned CO2 molecules. The interference takes place within a single molecule and within one optical cycle. Characteristic modulation patterns of the harmonic signals measured as a function of the pump–probe delay are explained with simple formulae determined by the valence orbital of the molecules.

In the absence of the field, the model supports up to two bound states, which have a large transition dipole moment. Hence, the physical systems best described by the model are molecular ions such as H+2. Rates for high-harmonic emission are calculated analytically up to one final quadrature. In terms of the rescattering picture, harmonic emission can be attributed to two different mechanisms: electrons recombine either at the center they started from or at the other one. The latter case allows for three topologically different classes of orbits, which lead to different spectral ranges of harmonics. Two of them are similar to atomic (one-center) harmonic generation, but have different cutoff laws that are no longer proportional to the ponderomotive potential. In the third the electron moves directly from one center to the other. This leads to strong harmonic emission at comparatively low frequencies similar to emission from a two-level atom with the cutoff proportional to the field amplitude rather than the intensity. The molecular dipole phase in this case is almost independent of the field intensity and, at constant intensity, the phases of neighboring harmonics are locked. Different orientations of the two-center system with respect to the field with various polarization configurations are investigated. Most of the observed features lend themselves to interpretation in terms of the simple man’s model.},

It is shown that, contrary to the case of rare gas atoms interacting with linearly polarized radiation, the dominant contribution to high-order harmonic generation by the studied class of systems comes from the bound-bound transitions. As a consequence, the mechanism of the process is different from the well-known rescattering mechanism due to Corkum and Kulander. At intensities high enough the molecular harmonic generation spectra reproduce the main features of the atomic ones, i.e., the plateau and the cutoff.

Initial delocalized states, such as molecular orbitals, are shown to create longer harmonic generation plateaus and one can therefore attribute enhancement of harmonic generation plateaus by electron repulsion due to the increased separation and delocalization of electrons in extended systems by correlation effects.},

Because the highest-lying orbitals are responsible for chemical properties, they are of particular interest. To observe these orbitals change as bonds are formed and broken is to observe the essence of chemistry. Yet single orbitals are difficult to observe experimentally, and until now, this has been impossible on the timescale of chemical reactions. Here we demonstrate that the full three-dimensional structure of a single orbital can be imaged by a seemingly unlikely technique, using high harmonics generated from intense femtosecond laser pulses focused on aligned molecules. Applying this approach to a series of molecular alignments, we accomplish a tomographic reconstruction of the highest occupied molecular orbital of N2. The method also allows us to follow the attosecond dynamics of an electron wave packet.},

Such ultrafast dynamics of electrons in matter is at the core of phenomena such as high-harmonic generation, where these dynamics lead to the emission of extreme-ultraviolet bursts with attosecond duration. So far, all ultrafast dynamics of matter were understood to purely originate from the classical vector potential of the driving light, disregarding the influence of the quantum nature of light. Here we show theoretically that the dynamics of matter driven by bright (intense) light significantly depend on the quantum state of the driving light through its quantum noise, which induces an effective photon-statistics force. To provide a unified framework for the analysis and control over such a force, we extend the strong-field approximation theory to account for non-classical driving light. Our quantum strong-field approximation theory shows that in high-harmonic generation, experimentally feasible squeezing of the driving light can shift and shape electronic trajectories and attosecond pulses at the scale of hundreds of attoseconds. Our work presents a new degree of freedom for attosecond spectroscopy, by relying on non-classical electromagnetic fields, and more generally, introduces a direct connection between attosecond science and quantum optics.},

However, since an ab initio treatment of even the simplest diatomic systems is beyond today's capabilities, approximate qualitative descriptions are warranted. In this paper, we develop such a theoretical approach to model the photoelectrons resulting from intense laser-molecule interaction. We present a general theory for symmetric diatomic molecules in the single active electron approximation that, amongst other capabilities, allows adjusting both the internuclear separation and molecular potential in a direct and simple way. More importantly, we derive an analytic approximate solution of the time-dependent Schrödinger equation (TDSE), based on a generalized strong-field approximation (SFA) version. Using that approach, we obtain expressions for electron emitted transition amplitudes from two different molecular centers, and accelerated then in the strong laser field. In addition, our approach directly underpins different underlying physical processes that correspond to (i) direct tunneling ionization; (ii) electron rescattering on the center of origin; and, finally, (iii) electron rescattering on a different center. One innovative aspect of our theory is the fact that the dipole matrix elements are free from nonphysical gauge and coordinate system-dependent terms: this is achieved by adapting the coordinate system, in which SFA is performed, to the center from which the corresponding part of the time-dependent wave function originates. Our analytic results agree very well with the numerical solution of the full three-dimensional TDSE for the H2+ molecule. Moreover, the theoretical model was applied to describe laser-induced electron diffraction measurements of O2+ molecules, obtained at ICFO, and reproduces the main features of the experiment very well. Our approach can be extended in a natural way to more complex molecules and multielectron systems.},

Even for the simplest diatomic systems, such as H2, today's computational capabilities are not enough to give a complete description of the electron and nuclear dynamics initiated by a strong laser field. As a consequence, approximate qualitative descriptions are called to play an important role. In this paper we extend the work presented in Suárez et al. [N. Suárez, A. Chacón, J. A. Pérez-Hernández, J. Biegert, M. Lewenstein, and M. F. Ciappina, High-order-harmonic generation in atomic and molecular systems, Phys. Rev. A 95, 033415 (2017)] to three-center molecular targets. Additionally, we incorporate a more accurate description of the molecular ground state, employing information extracted from quantum chemistry software packages. This step forward allows us to include, in a detailed way, both the molecular symmetries and nodes present in the high-occupied molecular orbital. We are able, on the one hand, to keep our formulation as analytical as in the case of diatomics and, on the other hand, to still give a complete description of the underlying physics behind the above-threshold ionization process.

These non-classical light states are generated by means of quantum state engineering methods, and they are considered as one of the main resources for fundamental tests of quantum theory and the development of new quantum technologies. However, the power of existing optical "cat" state sources is limited by their low average photon number, which prevents their use in nonlinear optics. Here, we demonstrate the generation of a femtosecond duration optical "cat" state in the infrared spectral range, with mean photon number orders of magnitude higher than those delivered by current available sources. These states exhibit intensities sufficient to induce nonlinear processes in matter. This is shown using the process of second harmonic generation in an optical crystal, in which the infrared-frequency photons of an optical "cat" state are up-converted into blue-frequency photons. We create the light states driving the second harmonic generation process, by means of conditioning operations applied on the quantum state of an intense infrared femtosecond laser field after its nonlinear interaction with atoms. Due to the presence of quantum interference between the coherent states composing the optical "cat" state, the quantum properties of the state are imprinted in the measured second-order interferometric autocorrelation traces. The findings introduce the optical "cat" states into the realm of nonlinear quantum optics, opening up exciting new paths in quantum information science.},

By means of Taylor expansions of the molecular SFA, we link this effect to the dynamics of the electron in the continuum. More precisely, we find that the value of the electric field at recombination time plays a crucial role in the shape of the destructive interference phase jump.},

	abstract = {We present a theory of ionization of diatomic molecules by a strong laser field. A diatomic molecule is considered as a three-particle system, which consists of two heavy atomic (ionic) centers and an electron. After the separation of the center-of-mass coordinate, the dynamics of this system is reduced to the relative electronic and nuclear coordinates. The exact S-matrix element for ionization is presented in a form in which the laser-molecule interaction is emphasized. This form is useful for application of the molecular strong-field approximation (SFA). We introduced two forms of the molecular SFA, one with the field-free and the other with the field-dressed initial molecular bound state. We relate these two forms of our modified molecular SFA to the standard molecular SFAs, introduced previously using the length gauge and the velocity gauge. Numerical examples of the ionization rates of N2 and O2 molecules are shown and compared for all four versions of the molecular SFA and we suggest that our modified molecular SFA should be used instead of the standard molecular SFA.},

	abstract = {Recently, using conditioning approaches on the high-harmonic generation process induced by intense laser-atom interactions, we have developed a new method for the generation of optical Schrödinger cat states (Lewenstein et al. in Nat Phys, 17 1104–1108, 2021. https://doi/10.1038/s41567-021-01317-w). These quantum optical states have been proven to be very manageable as, by modifying the conditions under which harmonics are generated, one can interplay between kitten and genuine cat states. Here, we demonstrate that this method can also be used for the development of new schemes towards the creation of optical Schrödinger cat states, consisting of the superposition of three distinct coherent states. Apart from the interest these kind of states have on their own, we additionally propose a scheme for using them towards the generation of large cat states involving the sum of two different coherent states. The quantum properties of the obtained superpositions aim to significantly increase the applicability of optical Schrödinger cat states for quantum technology and quantum information processing.},
