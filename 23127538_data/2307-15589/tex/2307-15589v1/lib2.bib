The principle was articulated by Hans Moravec, Rodney Brooks, Marvin Minsky and others in the 1980s. As Moravec writes, "it is comparatively easy to make computers exhibit adult level performance on intelligence tests or playing checkers, and difficult or impossible to give them the skills of a one-year-old when it comes to perception and mobility".Similarly, Minsky emphasized that the most difficult human skills to reverse engineer are those that are unconscious. "In general, we're least aware of what our minds do best", he wrote, and added "we're more aware of simple processes that don't work well than of complex ones that work flawlessly".},

Pure position control is unsuitable for such tasks because even small errors in the desired trajectory can cause significant deviations from the desired forces and torques. The proposed algorithm takes a reference Cartesian trajectory and force/torque profile as input and adapts the movement so that the resulting forces and torques match the reference profiles. The learning algorithm is based on dynamic movement primitives and quaternion representation of orientation, which provide a mathematical machinery for efficient and stable adaptation. Experimentally we show that the robot’s performance can be significantly improved within a few iteration steps, compensating for vision and other errors that might arise during the execution of the task. We also show that our methodology is suitable both for robots with admittance and for robots with impedance control.},

The conditions of such type of robotic tasks may significantly vary in dynamic environments, which demand robots to be endowed with adaptation capabilities. This can be achieved through learning methods that allow the robot not only to model a manipulation task but also to adapt to unseen situations. In this context, this paper proposes a learning-from-demonstration framework that integrates force sensing and variable impedance control to learn force-based variable stiffness skills. The proposed approach estimates full stiffness matrices from human demonstrations, which are then used along with the sensed forces to encode a probabilistic model of the task. This model is used to retrieve a time-varying stiffness profile that allows the robot to satisfactorily react to new task conditions. The proposed framework evaluates two different stiffness representations: Cholesky decomposition and a Riemannian manifold approach. We validate the proposed framework in simulation using 2D and 7D systems and a couple of real scenarios.},

  abstract = {Robots that physically interact with their surroundings, in order to accomplish some tasks or assist humans in their activities, require to exploit contact forces in a safe and proficient manner. Impedance control is considered as a prominent approach in robotics to avoid large impact forces while operating in unstructured environments. In such environments, the conditions under which the interaction occurs may significantly vary during the task execution. This demands robots to be endowed with on-line adaptation capabilities to cope with sudden and unexpected changes in the environment. In this context, variable impedance control arises as a powerful tool to modulate the robot's behavior in response to variations in its surroundings. In this survey, we present the state-of-the-art of approaches devoted to variable impedance control from control and learning perspectives (separately and jointly). Moreover, we propose a new taxonomy for mechanical impedance based on variability, learning, and control. The objective of this survey is to put together the concepts and efforts that have been done so far in this field, and to describe advantages and disadvantages of each approach. The survey concludes with open issues in the field and an envisioned framework that may potentially solve them.},

  abstract = {Deep Q-Learning (DQL), a family of temporal difference algorithms for control, employs three techniques collectively known as the `deadly triad' in reinforcement learning: bootstrapping, off-policy learning, and function approximation. Prior work has demonstrated that together these can lead to divergence in Q-learning algorithms, but the conditions under which divergence occurs are not well-understood. In this note, we give a simple analysis based on a linear approximation to the Q-value updates, which we believe provides insight into divergence under the deadly triad. The central point in our analysis is to consider when the leading order approximation to the deep-Q update is or is not a contraction in the sup norm. Based on this analysis, we develop an algorithm which permits stable deep Q-learning for continuous control without any of the tricks conventionally used (such as target networks, adaptive gradient optimizers, or using multiple Q functions). We demonstrate that our algorithm performs above or near state-of-the-art on standard MuJoCo benchmarks from the OpenAI Gym.},

The framework we develop is intrinsically non-asymptotic, capturing the finite nature of the training dataset, yet it allows distinguishing learning from memorization. It encompasses, as special cases, classical notions from Kolmogorov complexity, Shannon, and Fisher Information. However, unlike some of those frameworks, it can be applied easily to large-scale models and real-world datasets. It is the first framework to explicitly account for the optimization scheme, which plays a crucial role in Deep Learning, in measuring complexity and information.},

Our end goal is to use that pattern to understand interaction-related phenomena that emerge when systems interact. Rather than thinking of a system as a pair \$(\textbackslash mathbb\{U\}, \textbackslash mathcal\{B\})\$, we begin by thinking of it as an injective map from \$\textbackslash mathcal\{B\} \textbackslash rightarrow \textbackslash mathbb\{U\}\$. This relative perspective naturally brings about the sought structure, which we summarize in three points. First, the separation of behavioral equations and behavior is developed through two spaces, one of syntax and another of semantics, linked by an interpretation map. Second, the notion of interconnection and variable sharing is shown to be a construction of the same nature as that of gluing topological spaces or taking amalgamated sums of algebraic objects. Third, the notion of interconnection instantiates to both the syntax space and the semantics space, and the interpretation map is shown to preserve the interconnection when going from syntax to semantics. This pattern, in its generality, is made precise by borrowing very basic constructs from the language of categories and functors.},

The ability to calculate the state of constraint of parts in an assembly is useful in supporting quantitative design of properly constrained assemblies in CAD systems.

This method provides a useful inductive bias for certain problems, but existing software for differentiable optimization layers is rigid and difficult to apply to new settings. In this paper, we propose an approach to differentiating through disciplined convex programs, a subclass of convex optimization problems used by domain-specific languages (DSLs) for convex optimization. We introduce disciplined parametrized programming, a subset of disciplined convex programming, and we show that every disciplined parametrized program can be represented as the composition of an affine map from parameters to problem data, a solver, and an affine map from the solver’s solution to a solution of the original problem (a new form we refer to as affine-solver-affine form). We then demonstrate how to efficiently differentiate through each of these components, allowing for end-to-end analytical differentiation through the entire convex program. We implement our methodology in version 1.1 of CVXPY, a popular Python-embedded DSL for convex optimization, and additionally implement differentiable layers for disciplined convex programs in PyTorch and TensorFlow 2.0. Our implementation significantly lowers the barrier to using convex optimization problems in differentiable programs. We present applications in linear machine learning models and in stochastic control, and we show that our layer is competitive (in execution time) compared to specialized differentiable solvers from past work.},

  abstract = {Series elastic actuators (SEAs) are interesting for usage in harsh environments as they are more robust than rigid actuators. This paper shows how SEAs can be used in teleoperation to increase output velocity in dynamic tasks. A first experiment is presented that tested human ability to achieve higher hammerhead velocities with a flexible hammer than with a rigid hammer, and to evaluate the influence of the resonance frequency. In this experiment, 13 participants executed a hammering task in direct manipulation using flexible hammers in four conditions with resonance frequencies of 3.0 Hz to 9.9 Hz and one condition with a rigid hammer. Then, a second experiment is presented that tested the ability of 32 participants to reproduce the findings of the first experiment in teleoperated manipulation with different feedback conditions: with visual and force feedback, without visual feedback, without force feedback, and with a communication delay of 40 ms. The results indicate that humans can exploit the mechanical resonance of a flexible system to at least double the output velocity without combined force and vision feedback. This is an unexpected result, allowing the design of simpler and more robust teleoperators for dynamic tasks.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning for robotic applications faces the challenge of constraint satisfaction, which currently impedes its application to safety critical systems. Recent approaches successfully introduce safety based on reachability analysis, determining a safe region of the state space where the system can operate. However, overly constraining the freedom of the system can negatively affect performance, while attempting to learn less conservative safety constraints might fail to preserve safety if the learned constraints are inaccurate. We propose a novel method that uses a principled approach to learn the system's unknown dynamics based on a Gaussian process model and iteratively approximates the maximal safe set. A modified control strategy based on real-time model validation preserves safety under weaker conditions than current approaches. Our framework further incorporates safety into the reinforcement learning performance metric, allowing a better integration of safety and learning. We demonstrate our algorithm on simulations of a cart-pole system and on an experimental quadrotor application and show how our proposed scheme succeeds in preserving safety where current approaches fail to avoid an unsafe condition.},

The procedure computes reachable sets for uncertain initial states and inputs in an overapproximative way, i.e. it is guaranteed that all possible trajectories of the system are enclosed. Thus, the result can be used for formal verification of system properties that can be specified in the state space as unsafe or goal regions. Due to the representation of reachable sets by zonotopes and the use of highly scalable operations on them, the presented approach scales favorably with the number of state variables. This makes it possible to solve problems of industry-relevant size, as demonstrated by a transient stability analysis of the IEEE 14-bus benchmark problem for power systems.},

In particular, we will first consider output based feedback linearization strategies for locomotion together with whole-body control methods for manipulation. We will show that these two traditionally disjoint methods are equivalent through the correct choice of controller. We will then present a method for unifying these two methodologies through the use of control Lyapunov functions presented in the form of a quadratic program. In addition, it will be shown that these controllers can be combined with force-based control to achieve locomotion and force-based manipulation in a single framework. Finally, simulation results will be presented demonstrating the validity of the proposed framework.},

In this paper we discuss one such potential impact: the problem of accidents in machine learning systems, defined as unintended and harmful behavior that may emerge from poor design of real-world AI systems. We present a list of five practical research problems related to accident risk, categorized according to whether the problem originates from having the wrong objective function ("avoiding side effects" and "avoiding reward hacking"), an objective function that is too expensive to evaluate frequently ("scalable supervision"), or undesirable behavior during the learning process ("safe exploration" and "distributional shift"). We review previous work in these areas as well as suggesting research directions with a focus on relevance to cutting-edge AI systems. Finally, we consider the high-level question of how to think most productively about the safety of forward-looking applications of AI.},

In this paper, we explore the foundations for such an architecture: we show how techniques from sensitivity analysis, bilevel optimization, and implicit differentiation can be used to exactly differentiate through these layers and with respect to layer parameters; we develop a highly efficient solver for these layers that exploits fast GPU-based batch solves within a primal-dual interior point method, and which provides backpropagation gradients with virtually no additional cost on top of the solve; and we highlight the application of these approaches in several problems. In one notable example, we show that the method is capable of learning to play mini-Sudoku (4x4) given just input and output games, with no a priori information about the rules of the game; this highlights the ability of our architecture to learn hard constraints better than other neural architectures.},

The impedance or admittance controllers can only work if they are followed by either the force or the position controller respectively. These combinations place the impedance or admittance controller as high-level controller while the force or position controller as low-level controller. From the application point of view, the exoskeleton controllers are equipped by task controllers that can be formed in several ways depend on the aims. This paper presents the review of the control systems in the existing active exoskeleton in the last decade. The exoskeleton control system can be categorized according to the model system, the physical parameters, the hierarchy and the usage. These considerations give different control schemes. The main consideration of exoskeleton control design is how to achieve the best control performances. However, stability and safety are other important issues that have to be considered.},

  abstract = {We explore the possibility of achieving passive compliance through the structure of the manipulator itself. The emphasis is on passive compliance because a minimum of passive compliance to prevent jamming will always be required even when active stiffness control is employed. Particular attention is given to the large class of robots with nonbackdrivable actuators, where the actuator must be commanded to move, and in which actuator forces or torques are not easily interpreted as end-effector forces and torques. We present a novel framework for specifying the desired end-effector compliance for several tasks in terms of stiffness matrices. We explore whether the desired stiffness matrix of a manipulator can be achieved by using the natural or designed stiffness of the manipulator limbs themselves. Several techniques for adjusting the manipulator stiffness matrix are proposed. Achieving this variable passive compliance allows the attainment of high stiffnesses for fast and accurate movements and low stiffness values for force control. Furthermore, achieving nondiagonal stiffness properties wherein there are force and motion coupling in different directions is shown to be useful to prevent jamming and contact induced vibrations.{$<>$}},

  abstract = {Latent variable time-series models are among the most heavily used tools from machine learning and applied statistics. These models have the advantage of learning latent structure both from noisy observations and from the temporal ordering in the data, where it is assumed that meaningful correlation structure exists across time. A few highly-structured models, such as the linear dynamical system with linear-Gaussian observations, have closed-form inference procedures (e.g. the Kalman Filter), but this case is an exception to the general rule that exact posterior inference in more complex generative models is intractable. Consequently, much work in time-series modeling focuses on approximate inference procedures for one particular class of models. Here, we extend recent developments in stochastic variational inference to develop a `black-box' approximate inference technique for latent variable models with latent dynamical structure. We propose a structured Gaussian variational approximate posterior that carries the same intuition as the standard Kalman filter-smoother but, importantly, permits us to use the same inference approach to approximate the posterior of much more general, nonlinear latent variable generative models. We show that our approach recovers accurate estimates in the case of basic models with closed-form posteriors, and more interestingly performs well in comparison to variational approaches that were designed in a bespoke fashion for specific non-conjugate models.},

Recent work has shown that human feedback can be characterized as a critique of an agent's current behavior rather than as an alternative reward signal to be maximized, culminating in the COnvergent Actor-Critic by Humans (COACH) algorithm for making direct policy updates based on human feedback. Our work builds on COACH, moving to a setting where the agent's policy is represented by a deep neural network. We employ a series of modifications on top of the original COACH algorithm that are critical for successfully learning behaviors from high-dimensional observations, while also satisfying the constraint of obtaining reduced sample complexity. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our Deep COACH algorithm in the rich 3D world of Minecraft with an agent that learns to complete tasks by mapping from raw pixels to actions using only real-time human feedback in 10-15 minutes of interaction.},

  abstract = {Controller design faces a trade-off between robustness and performance, and the reliability of linear controllers has caused many practitioners to focus on the former. However, there is renewed interest in improving system performance to deal with growing energy constraints. This paper describes a learning-based model predictive control (LBMPC) scheme that provides deterministic guarantees on robustness, while statistical identification tools are used to identify richer models of the system in order to improve performance; the benefits of this framework are that it handles state and input constraints, optimizes system performance with respect to a cost function, and can be designed to use a wide variety of parametric or nonparametric statistical tools. The main insight of LBMPC is that safety and performance can be decoupled under reasonable conditions in an optimization framework by maintaining two models of the system. The first is an approximate model with bounds on its uncertainty, and the second model is updated by statistical methods. LBMPC improves performance by choosing inputs that minimize a cost subject to the learned dynamics, and it ensures safety and robustness by checking whether these same inputs keep the approximate model stable when it is subject to uncertainty. Furthermore, we show that if the system is sufficiently excited, then the LBMPC control action probabilistically converges to that of an MPC computed using the true dynamics.},

  abstract = {The inertial parameters of manipulator rigid-body loads and links have been automatically estimated as a result of gen eral movement. The Newton-Euler equations have been recast to relate linearly the measured joint forces or torques via acceleration-dependent coefficients to the inertial parame ters, which have then been estimated by least squares. Load estimation was implemented on a PUMA 600 robot equipped with an R TI FS-B wrist force-torque sensor and on the MIT Serial Link Direct Drive Arm equipped with a Barry Wright Company Astek wrist force-torque sensor. Good estimates were obtained for load mass and center of mass, and the forces and torques due to movement of the load could be pre dicted accurately. The load moments of inertia were more difficult to estimate. Link estimation was implemented on the MIT Serial Link Direct Drive Arm. A good match was ob tained between joint torques predicted from the estimated parameters and the joint torques estimated from motor cur rents. The match actually proved superior to predicted torques based on link inertial parameters derived by CAD modeling. Restrictions on the identifiability of link inertial parameters due to restricted sensing and movement near the base have been addressed. Implications of estimation accu racy for manipulator dynamics and control have been consid ered.},

The proposed kinematic arrangement makes it possible to intuitively manipulate a payload undergoing 3-DoF spatial rotations by adding a third rotational axis oriented in the direction of gravity. The static equilibrium equations of the 2-DoF architecture are first described in order to provide the required configuration of the counterweights for a statically balanced mechanism. A method for calibrating the mechanism, which establishes the coefficients of the static equilibrium equations, is also presented. In order to both translate and rotate the payload during manipulation, the rotational manipulator is mounted on an existing translational manipulator. Experimental validations of both systems are presented to demonstrate the intuitive and responsive behaviour of the manipulators during physical human-robot interactions.},

In the present paper we consider predictive information in sensor space as a measure for the behavioral complexity of a two-wheel embodied robot moving in a rectangular arena with several obstacles. The mutual information (MI) between past and future sensor values is found empirically to have a maximum for a behavior which is both explorative and sensitive to the environment. This makes predictive information a prospective candidate as an objective function for the autonomous development of such behaviors. We derive theoretical expressions for the MI in order to obtain an explicit update rule for the gradient ascent dynamics. Interestingly, in the case of a linear or linearized model of the sensorimotor dynamics the structure of the learning rule derived depends only on the dynamical properties while the value of the MI influences only the learning rate. In this way the problem of the prohibitively large sampling times for information theoretic measures can be circumvented. This result can be generalized and may help to derive explicit learning rules from complexity theoretic measures.},

  abstract = {In the near future, collaborative robots (cobots) are expected to play a vital role in the manufacturing and automation sectors. It is predicted that workers will work side by side in collaboration with cobots to surpass fully automated factories. In this regard, physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) aims to develop natural communication between the partners to bring speed, flexibility, and ergonomics to the execution of complex manufacturing tasks. One challenge in pHRI is to design an optimal interaction controller to balance the limitations introduced by the contradicting nature of transparency and stability requirements. In this paper, a general methodology to design an admittance controller for a pHRI system is developed by considering the stability and transparency objectives. In our approach, collaborative robot constrains the movement of human operator to help with a pHRI task while an augmented reality (AR) interface informs the operator about its phases. To this end, dynamical characterization of the collaborative robot (LBR IIWA 7 R800, KUKA Inc.) is presented first. Then, the stability and transparency analyses for our pHRI task involving collaborative drilling with this robot are reported. A range of allowable parameters for the admittance controller is determined by superimposing the stability and transparency graphs. Finally, three different sets of parameters are selected from the allowable range and the effect of admittance controllers utilizing these parameter sets on the task performance is investigated.},

  abstract = {Predicting the future in real-world settings, particularly from raw sensory observations such as images, is exceptionally challenging. Real-world events can be stochastic and unpredictable, and the high dimensionality and complexity of natural images requires the predictive model to build an intricate understanding of the natural world. Many existing methods tackle this problem by making simplifying assumptions about the environment. One common assumption is that the outcome is deterministic and there is only one plausible future. This can lead to low-quality predictions in real-world settings with stochastic dynamics. In this paper, we develop a stochastic variational video prediction (SV2P) method that predicts a different possible future for each sample of its latent variables. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first to provide effective stochastic multi-frame prediction for real-world video. We demonstrate the capability of the proposed method in predicting detailed future frames of videos on multiple real-world datasets, both action-free and action-conditioned. We find that our proposed method produces substantially improved video predictions when compared to the same model without stochasticity, and to other stochastic video prediction methods. Our SV2P implementation will be open sourced upon publication.},

  abstract = {We propose an approach to self-supervised representation learning based on maximizing mutual information between features extracted from multiple views of a shared context. For example, one could produce multiple views of a local spatio-temporal context by observing it from different locations (e.g., camera positions within a scene), and via different modalities (e.g., tactile, auditory, or visual). Or, an ImageNet image could provide a context from which one produces multiple views by repeatedly applying data augmentation. Maximizing mutual information between features extracted from these views requires capturing information about high-level factors whose influence spans multiple views -- e.g., presence of certain objects or occurrence of certain events. Following our proposed approach, we develop a model which learns image representations that significantly outperform prior methods on the tasks we consider. Most notably, using self-supervised learning, our model learns representations which achieve 68.1\% accuracy on ImageNet using standard linear evaluation. This beats prior results by over 12\% and concurrent results by 7\%. When we extend our model to use mixture-based representations, segmentation behaviour emerges as a natural side-effect.

To address model uncertainty systematically, we propose to use Bayesian reinforcement learning and cast it as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). We present a simple algorithm for offline POMDP planning in the continuous state space. Offline planning produces a POMDP policy, which can be executed efficiently online as a finite-state controller. This approach seamlessly integrates planning and learning: it incorporates learning objectives in the computed plan, which then enables the robot to learn nearly optimally online and reach the goal. We evaluated the approach in simulations on two distinct tasks, acrobot swing-up and autonomous vehicle navigation amidst pedestrians, and obtained interesting preliminary results.},

Traditionally, robots treat physical interaction as a disturbance, and resume their original behavior after the interaction ends.

We formalize learning from such interactions as a dynamical system in which the task objective has parameters that are part of the hidden state, and physical human interactions are observations about these parameters. We derive an online approximation of the robot’s optimal policy in this system, and test it in a user study. The results suggest that learning from physical interaction leads to better robot task performance with less human effort.},

Impedance control techniques provide effective solutions to achieve this, however, their quasi-static performance is highly dependent on the choice of parameters, i.e. stiffness and damping. In most cases, such parameters are previously selected by robot programmers to achieve a desired response, which limits the adaptation capability of robots to varying task conditions. To improve the generality of interaction planning through task-dependent regulation of the parameters, this paper introduces a novel self-regulating impedance controller. The regulation of the parameters is achieved based on the robot's local sensory data, and on an interaction expectancy value. This value combines the interaction values from the robot state machine and visual feedback, to authorize the autonomous tuning of the impedance parameters in selective Cartesian axes. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated experimentally in a debris removal task.},

  abstract = {The connections between optimal control and Bayesian inference have long been recognised, with the field of stochastic (optimal) control combining these frameworks for the solution of partially observable control problems. In particular, for the linear case with quadratic functions and Gaussian noise, stochastic control has shown remarkable results in different fields, including robotics, reinforcement learning and neuroscience, especially thanks to the established duality of estimation and control processes. Following this idea we recently introduced a formulation of PID control, one of the most popular methods from classical control, based on active inference, a theory with roots in variational Bayesian methods, and applications in the biological and neural sciences. In this work, we highlight the advantages of our previous formulation and introduce new and more general ways to tackle some existing problems in current controller design procedures. In particular, we consider 1) a gradient-based tuning rule for the parameters (or gains) of a PID controller, 2) an implementation of multiple degrees of freedom for independent responses to different types of signals (e.g., two-degree-of-freedom PID), and 3) a novel time-domain formalisation of the performance-robustness trade-off in terms of tunable constraints (i.e., priors in a Bayesian model) of a single cost functional, variational free energy.},

  abstract = {Embed-to-control (E2C) [17] is a model for solving high-dimensional optimal control problems by combining variational autoencoders with locally-optimal controllers. However, the E2C model suffers from two major drawbacks: 1) its objective function does not correspond to the likelihood of the data sequence and 2) the variational encoder used for embedding typically has large variational approximation error, especially when there is noise in the system dynamics. In this paper, we present a new model for learning robust locally-linear controllable embedding (RCE). Our model directly estimates the predictive conditional density of the future observation given the current one, while introducing the bottleneck [11] between the current and future observations. Although the bottleneck provides a natural embedding candidate for control, our RCE model introduces additional specific structures in the generative graphical model so that the model dynamics can be robustly linearized. We also propose a principled variational approximation of the embedding posterior that takes the future observation into account, and thus, makes the variational approximation more robust against the noise. Experimental results show that RCE outperforms the E2C model, and does so significantly when the underlying dynamics is noisy.},

This is sensible if we only want to optimize a single controller. But if learned manipulation primitives are used as modules in a larger system, then it is also important that their generated sensor traces facilitate recognition of action-outcomes. Optimization solely for expected success of a primitive does not guarantee this. We demonstrate a simple example for optimization of actions towards observability, combined with optimization for expected success. Our experiment is a manipulation task with a soft manipulator, where an action primitive is learned such that its generated sensor trace helps a classifier to distinguish task success and task failure. The experimental results indicate that adding auxiliary forces to the original manipulation primitive can indeed facilitate outcome recognition for manipulation tasks.},

In this paper, we present stability results for the GP-SSM depending on selected covariance function employing a deterministic point of view as widely done in the literature. The focus is set on the squared exponential function which is one of the most used covariance functions for nonlinear regression. We start with calculations according to the equilibrium points of GP-SSM and continue with conditions for stability.},

Though peg-in-hole assembly is a common industrial task that has been extensively researched, safely solving complex high-precision assembly in an unstructured environment remains an open problem. Reinforcement-learning (RL) methods have proven to be successful in autonomously solving manipulation tasks. However, RL is still not widely adopted on real robotic systems because working with real hardware entails additional challenges, especially when using position-controlled manipulators. The main contribution of this work is a learning-based method to solve peg-in-hole tasks with hole-position uncertainty. We propose the use of an off-policy model-free reinforcement-learning method, and we bootstraped the training speed by using several transfer-learning techniques (sim2real) and domain randomization. Our proposed learning framework for position-controlled robots was extensively evaluated on contact-rich insertion tasks in a variety of environments.},

However, programming such interactive skills is a challenging task, as each interaction partner can have different timing or an alternative way of executing movements. In this paper, we propose to learn interaction skills by observing how two humans engage in a similar task. To this end, we introduce a new representation called Interaction Primitives. Interaction primitives build on the framework of dynamic motor primitives (DMPs) by maintaining a distribution over the parameters of the DMP. With this distribution, we can learn the inherent correlations of cooperative activities which allow us to infer the behavior of the partner and to participate in the cooperation. We will provide algorithms for synchronizing and adapting the behavior of humans and robots during joint physical activities.},

This is something that, surprisingly, seems to be missing from the literature, even though autonomy is considered to be a basic concept in many disciplines, including artificial life. We work in an information theoretic setting for which the distinction between system and environment is the starting point. As a measure for autonomy, we propose the conditional mutual information between consecutive states of the system conditioned on the history of the environment. This works well when the system cannot influence the environment at all. When, in contrast, the system has full control over its environment, we should instead neglect the environment history and simply take the mutual information between consecutive system states as a measure of autonomy. In the case of mutual interaction between system and environment there remains an ambiguity. If the interaction structure of the system is known, we define a ”causal ” autonomy measure which allows this ambiguity to be resolved. Moreover, our analysis reveals some subtle facets of the concept of autonomy, in particular with respect to the seemingly innocent system-environment distinction we took for granted and raise the issue of the attribution of control, i.e. the responsibility for observed effects. To further explore these issues, we evaluate our autonomy measure for simple automata, an agent moving in space, gliders in the game of life, and the tessellation automaton for autopoiesis of Varela et al. 1},

Three qualitatively different behaviors are found in the limit of large observation times \$T\$: \$I\_\{\textbackslash rm pred\} (T)\$ can remain finite, grow logarithmically, or grow as a fractional power law. If the time series allows us to learn a model with a finite number of parameters, then \$I\_\{\textbackslash rm pred\} (T)\$ grows logarithmically with a coefficient that counts the dimensionality of the model space. In contrast, power--law growth is associated, for example, with the learning of infinite parameter (or nonparametric) models such as continuous functions with smoothness constraints. There are connections between the predictive information and measures of complexity that have been defined both in learning theory and in the analysis of physical systems through statistical mechanics and dynamical systems theory. Further, in the same way that entropy provides the unique measure of available information consistent with some simple and plausible conditions, we argue that the divergent part of \$I\_\{\textbackslash rm pred\} (T)\$ provides the unique measure for the complexity of dynamics underlying a time series. Finally, we discuss how these ideas may be useful in different problems in physics, statistics, and biology.},

Design/methodology/approach This paper exploits a combination of the dynamical system and the admittance model to create robot behaviors. The reference trajectories are generated by dynamical systems while the admittance control enables robots to compliantly follow the reference trajectories. To determine how control is divided between the two models, a collaborative arbitration algorithm is presented to change their contributions to the robot motion based on the contact forces. In addition, the authors investigate to model the robot’s impedance characteristics as a function of the task requirements and build a novel artificial damping field (ADF) to represent the virtual damping at arbitrary robot states. Findings The authors evaluate their methods through experiments on an UR10 robot. The result shows promising performances for the robot to achieve complex tasks in collaboration with human partners. Originality/value The proposed method extends the dynamical system approach with an admittance control law to allow a robot motion being adjusted in real time. Besides, the authors propose a novel ADF method to model the robot’s impedance characteristics as a function of the task requirements.},

Adaptation of DMPs to new task requirements becomes difficult when demonstrated trajectories are only available in joint space, because their parameters do not in general correspond to variables meaningful for the task. This problem becomes more severe with increasing number of degrees of freedom and hence is particularly an issue for humanoid movements. It has been shown that DMP parameters can directly relate to task variables, when DMPs are learned in latent spaces resulting from dimensionality reduction of demonstrated trajectories. As we show here, however, standard dimensionality reduction techniques do not in general provide adequate latent spaces which need to be highly regular.},

  abstract = {The paper deals with controlled mechanical systems in which the number of control inputs is equal to the number of desired system outputs, and is smaller than the number of degrees of freedom of the system. The determination of control input strategy that force the underactuated system to complete the partly specified motion is a challenging problem. In the present formulation, the outputs (performance goals), expressed in terms of system states, are treated as constraints on the system—called control or program constraints as distinct from contact constraints in the classical sense, and a mathematical resemblance of the inverse control problem to the constrained system dynamics is exploited. However, while the reactions of contact constraints act in the directions orthogonal to the respective constraint manifold, the available control reactions may have arbitrary directions with respect to the program constraint manifold, and in the extreme may be tangent. A specific methodology must then be developed to find the solution of such “singular” problems, related to a class of control tracking problems such as position control of elastic joint robots, control of cranes, and aircraft control in prescribed trajectory flight. The governing equations of the problem arise as a set of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs), and an effective method for solving the DAEs, based on backward Euler method, is proposed. The open-loop control formulation obtained this way is then extended by a closed-loop control law to provide stable tracking of the required reference trajectories in the presence of perturbations. Some examples of applications of the theory and results of numerical simulations are reported.},

This paper introduces an approach to probabilistically fuse contact models, managing uncertainty in terrain geometry, dynamic modeling, and kinematics to improve the robustness of contact initiation at touchdown. A discrete-time extension of the generalized-momentum disturbance observer is presented to increase the accuracy of proprioceptive force control estimates. This information is fused with other contact priors under a framework of Kalman Filtering to increase robustness of the method. This approach results in accurate contact detection with 99.3 \% accuracy and a small 4-5ms delay. Using this new detector, an Event-Based Finite State Machine is implemented to deal with unexpected early and late contacts. This allows the robot to traverse cluttered environments by modifying the control actions for each individual leg based on the estimated contact state rather than adhering to a rigid time schedule regardless of actual contact state. Experiments with the MIT Cheetah 3 robot show the success of both the detection algorithm, as well as the Event-Based FSM while making unexpected contacts during trotting.},

  abstract = {Automatic differentiation (autodiff) has revolutionized machine learning. It allows expressing complex computations by composing elementary ones in creative ways and removes the burden of computing their derivatives by hand. More recently, differentiation of optimization problem solutions has attracted widespread attention with applications such as optimization layers, and in bi-level problems such as hyper-parameter optimization and meta-learning. However, so far, implicit differentiation remained difficult to use for practitioners, as it often required case-by-case tedious mathematical derivations and implementations. In this paper, we propose a unified, efficient and modular approach for implicit differentiation of optimization problems. In our approach, the user defines directly in Python a function F capturing the optimality conditions of the problem to be differentiated. Once this is done, we leverage autodiff of F and implicit differentiation to automatically differentiate the optimization problem. Our approach thus combines the benefits of implicit differentiation and autodiff. It is efficient as it can be added on top of any state-of-the-art solver and modular as the optimality condition specification is decoupled from the implicit differentiation mechanism. We show that seemingly simple principles allow to recover many exiting implicit differentiation methods and create new ones easily. We demonstrate the ease of formulating and solving bilevel optimization problems using our framework. We also showcase an application to the sensitivity analysis of molecular dynamics.},

  abstract = {Learning robot objective functions from human input has become increasingly important, but state-of-the-art techniques assume that the human's desired objective lies within the robot's hypothesis space. When this is not true, even methods that keep track of uncertainty over the objective fail because they reason about which hypothesis might be correct, and not whether any of the hypotheses are correct. We focus specifically on learning from physical human corrections during the robot's task execution, where not having a rich enough hypothesis space leads to the robot updating its objective in ways that the person did not actually intend. We observe that such corrections appear irrelevant to the robot, because they are not the best way of achieving any of the candidate objectives. Instead of naively trusting and learning from every human interaction, we propose robots learn conservatively by reasoning in real time about how relevant the human's correction is for the robot's hypothesis space. We test our inference method in an experiment with human interaction data, and demonstrate that this alleviates unintended learning in an in-person user study with a 7DoF robot manipulator.},

  abstract = {Robots need models of human behavior for both inferring human goals and preferences, and predicting what people will do. A common model is the Boltzmann noisily-rational decision model, which assumes people approximately optimize a reward function and choose trajectories in proportion to their exponentiated reward. While this model has been successful in a variety of robotics domains, its roots lie in econometrics, and in modeling decisions among different discrete options, each with its own utility or reward. In contrast, human trajectories lie in a continuous space, with continuous-valued features that influence the reward function. We propose that it is time to rethink the Boltzmann model, and design it from the ground up to operate over such trajectory spaces. We introduce a model that explicitly accounts for distances between trajectories, rather than only their rewards. Rather than each trajectory affecting the decision independently, similar trajectories now affect the decision together. We start by showing that our model better explains human behavior in a user study. We then analyze the implications this has for robot inference, first in toy environments where we have ground truth and find more accurate inference, and finally for a 7DOF robot arm learning from user demonstrations.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning algorithms have shown great success in solving different problems ranging from playing video games to robotics. However, they struggle to solve delicate robotic problems, especially those involving contact interactions. Though in principle a policy outputting joint torques should be able to learn these tasks, in practice we see that they have difficulty to robustly solve the problem without any structure in the action space. In this paper, we investigate how the choice of action space can give robust performance in presence of contact uncertainties. We propose to learn a policy that outputs impedance and desired position in joint space as a function of system states without imposing any other structure to the problem. We compare the performance of this approach to torque and position control policies under different contact uncertainties. Extensive simulation results on two different systems, a hopper (floating-base) with intermittent contacts and a manipulator (fixed-base) wiping a table, show that our proposed approach outperforms policies outputting torque or position in terms of both learning rate and robustness to environment uncertainty.},

These protocols may also be combined with AdaBoost. They rely on a library of building blocks for constructing classifiers securely, and we demonstrate the versatility of this library by constructing a face detection classifier.

Science, this issue p. 145; see also p. 122 Poker is a family of games that exhibit imperfect information, where players do not have full knowledge of past events. Whereas many perfect-information games have been solved (e.g., Connect Four and checkers), no nontrivial imperfect-information game played competitively by humans has previously been solved. Here, we announce that heads-up limit Texas hold’em is now essentially weakly solved. Furthermore, this computation formally proves the common wisdom that the dealer in the game holds a substantial advantage. This result was enabled by a new algorithm, CFR+, which is capable of solving extensive-form games orders of magnitude larger than previously possible. A computer goes to Las Vegas.

  abstract = {Active constraints, also known as virtual fixtures, are high-level control algorithms which can be used to assist a human in man-machine collaborative manipulation tasks. The active constraint controller monitors the robotic manipulator with respect to the environment and task, and anisotropically regulates the motion to provide assistance. The type of assistance offered by active constraints can vary, but they are typically used to either guide the user along a task-specific pathway or limit the user to within a “safe” region. There are several diverse methods described within the literature for applying active constraints, and these are surveyed within this paper. The active constraint research is described and compared using a simple generalized framework, which consists of three primary processes: 1) constraint definition, 2) constraint evaluation, and 3) constraint enforcement. All relevant research approaches for each of these processes, found using search terms associated to “virtual fixture,” “active constraint” and “motion constraint,” are presented.},

Ensuring input-output stability of plants experiencing passivity violations is the motivation behind this work. Given a previously designed controller and plant that has experienced a (partially unknown) passivity violation, a novel sector bound selection procedure is presented. This procedure can be used to assess input-output stability of the violated plant and original controller via the Conic Sector Theorem. Should input-output stability not be ensured, two original controller synthesis methods are suggested: one is designed to mimic the H2 controller, and the other is inspired by strictly positive real controller synthesis. Both methods guarantee input-output stability by selecting controllers within appropriate conic sectors, and involve only the evaluation of readily solvable linear matrix inequalities and algebraic Riccati inequalities. A numerical simulation is provided as a proof of concept.},

These mental models have the potential to affect both the human's decision making during the interaction and the human's subjective assessment of the interaction. In this paper, we surveyed existing methods for modeling how humans view robots, then identified a potential method for improving these estimates through inferring a human's model of a robot agent directly from their actions. Then, we conducted an online study to collect data in a grid-world environment involving humans moving an avatar past a virtual agent. Through our analysis, we demonstrated that participants' action choices leaked information about their mental models of a virtual agent. We conclude by discussing the implications of these findings and the potential for such a method to improve human-robot interactions.},

  abstract = {Bayesian inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) methods are ideal for safe imitation learning, as they allow a learning agent to reason about reward uncertainty and the safety of a learned policy. However, Bayesian IRL is computationally intractable for high-dimensional problems because each sample from the posterior requires solving an entire Markov Decision Process (MDP). While there exist non-Bayesian deep IRL methods, these methods typically infer point estimates of reward functions, precluding rigorous safety and uncertainty analysis. We propose Bayesian Reward Extrapolation (B-REX), a highly efficient, preference-based Bayesian reward learning algorithm that scales to high-dimensional, visual control tasks. Our approach uses successor feature representations and preferences over demonstrations to efficiently generate samples from the posterior distribution over the demonstrator's reward function without requiring an MDP solver. Using samples from the posterior, we demonstrate how to calculate high-confidence bounds on policy performance in the imitation learning setting, in which the ground-truth reward function is unknown. We evaluate our proposed approach on the task of learning to play Atari games via imitation learning from pixel inputs, with no access to the game score. We demonstrate that B-REX learns imitation policies that are competitive with a state-of-the-art deep imitation learning method that only learns a point estimate of the reward function. Furthermore, we demonstrate that samples from the posterior generated via B-REX can be used to compute high-confidence performance bounds for a variety of evaluation policies. We show that high-confidence performance bounds are useful for accurately ranking different evaluation policies when the reward function is unknown. We also demonstrate that high-confidence performance bounds may be useful for detecting reward hacking.},

  abstract = {One of the hallmarks of the performance, versatility, and robustness of biological motor control is the ability to adapt the impedance of the overall biomechanical system to different task requirements and stochastic disturbances. A transfer of this principle to robotics is desirable, for instance to enable robots to work robustly and safely in everyday human environments. It is, however, not trivial to derive variable impedance controllers for practical high degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic tasks. In this contribution, we accomplish such variable impedance control with the reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm PI2 (Policy Improvement with Path Integrals). PI2 is a model-free, sampling-based learning method derived from first principles of stochastic optimal control. The PI2 algorithm requires no tuning of algorithmic parameters besides the exploration noise. The designer can thus fully focus on the cost function design to specify the task. From the viewpoint of robotics, a particular useful property of PI2 is that it can scale to problems of many DOFs, so that reinforcement learning on real robotic systems becomes feasible. We sketch the PI2 algorithm and its theoretical properties, and how it is applied to gain scheduling for variable impedance control. We evaluate our approach by presenting results on several simulated and real robots. We consider tasks involving accurate tracking through via points, and manipulation tasks requiring physical contact with the environment. In these tasks, the optimal strategy requires both tuning of a reference trajectory and the impedance of the end-effector. The results show that we can use path integral based reinforcement learning not only for planning but also to derive variable gain feedback controllers in realistic scenarios. Thus, the power of variable impedance control is made available to a wide variety of robotic systems and practical applications.},

Because available actuators are unable to provide sufficiently high force density and low impedance, controllers for such machines often attempt to mask the robots physical dynamics, though this threatens stability. Controlling for passivity, the state-of-the-art means of ensuring coupled stability, inherently limits performance to levels that are often unacceptable. A controller that imposes passivity is compared to a controller designed by a new method that uses limited knowledge of human dynamics to improve performance. Both controllers were implemented on a testbed, and coupled stability and performance were tested. Results show that the new controller can improve both stability and performance. The different structures of the controllers yield key differences in physical behavior, and guidelines are provided to assist in choosing the appropriate approach for specific applications},

This paper examines how stability can be evaluated in human movements, and possible mechanisms by which humans ensure stability. First, a measure of stability is introduced, which is simple to apply to human movements and corresponds to Lyapunov exponents. Its application to real data shows that it is able to distinguish effectively between stable and unstable dynamics. A computational model is then used to investigate stability in human arm movements, which takes into account motor output variability and computes the force to perform a task according to an inverse dynamics model. Simulation results suggest that even a large time delay does not affect movement stability as long as the reflex feedback is small relative to muscle elasticity. Simulations are also used to demonstrate that existing learning schemes, using a monotonic antisymmetric update law, cannot compensate for unstable dynamics. An impedance compensation algorithm is introduced to learn unstable dynamics, which produces similar adaptation responses to those found in experiments.},

  abstract = {In this work, we present an approach to deep visuomotor control using structured deep dynamics models. Our deep dynamics model, a variant of SE3-Nets, learns a low-dimensional pose embedding for visuomotor control via an encoder-decoder structure. Unlike prior work, our dynamics model is structured: given an input scene, our network explicitly learns to segment salient parts and predict their pose-embedding along with their motion modeled as a change in the pose space due to the applied actions. We train our model using a pair of point clouds separated by an action and show that given supervision only in the form of point-wise data associations between the frames our network is able to learn a meaningful segmentation of the scene along with consistent poses. We further show that our model can be used for closed-loop control directly in the learned low-dimensional pose space, where the actions are computed by minimizing error in the pose space using gradient-based methods, similar to traditional model-based control. We present results on controlling a Baxter robot from raw depth data in simulation and in the real world and compare against two baseline deep networks. Our method runs in real-time, achieves good prediction of scene dynamics and outperforms the baseline methods on multiple control runs.

Based only on sequences of depth images along with action vectors and point wise data associations, SE3-Nets learn to segment effected object parts and predict their motion resulting from the applied force. Rather than learning point wise flow vectors, SE3-Nets predict SE(3) transformations for different parts of the scene. Using simulated depth data of a table top scene and a robot manipulator, we show that the structure underlying SE3-Nets enables them to generate a far more consistent prediction of object motion than traditional flow based networks. Additional experiments with a depth camera observing a Baxter robot pushing objects on a table show that SE3-Nets also work well on real data.},

Compliant control is fundamental when dealing with unstructured environments, as in the case of human-robot interaction.

In this review, we analyze solutions from traditional robotics, usually involving stiff joints, and recent literature to find common control concepts and differences. To this aim, we bring back every schemas and relative mathematics formulation to a common and simplified scenario. Then, for each schema, we explain its intuitive meaning and report issues raised in the literature. We also propose an expansion of taxonomy to account for recent research.},

The proposed system takes into account the important characteristics of the task and the redundancy of the robot to determine a controller that is safe for the user. The constraints of the task are first extracted using several examples of the skill demonstrated to the robot through kinesthetic teaching. An active control strategy based on task-space control with variable stiffness is proposed, and combined with a safety strategy for tasks requiring humans to move in the vicinity of robots. A risk indicator for human-robot collision is defined, which modulates a repulsive force distorting the spatial and temporal characteristics of the movement according to the task constraints. We illustrate the approach with two human-robot interaction experiments, where the user teaches the robot first how to move a tray, and then shows it how to iron a napkin.},

It then shows that the method is not restricted to movements in task space, but that it can also be exploited to handle constraints in joint space, including priority constraints.},

However, each user has his/her own preferences, needs and abilities. Therefore, robotic assistants will need to adapt to them, behaving accordingly. Towards this goal, we propose a method to perform behavior adaptation to the user preferences, using symbolic task planning. A user model is built from the user’s answers to simple questions with a fuzzy inference system, and it is then integrated into the planning domain. We describe an adaptation method based on both the user satisfaction and the execution outcome, depending on which penalizations are applied to the planner’s rules. We demonstrate the application of the adaptation method in a simple shoe-fitting scenario, with experiments performed in a simulated user environment. The results show quick behavior adaptation, even when the user behavior changes, as well as robustness to wrong inference of the initial user model. Finally, some insights in a non-simulated world shoe-fitting setup are also provided.},

Design/methodology/approach The basic impedance function with a pre-PID tuner is designed to improve the force response. A dynamic adaptive adjustment function that combines the advantages of hybrid impedance and adaptive hybrid impedance control is presented to achieve both force overshoots suppressing and tracking ability. Findings The introduced pre-PID tuner impedance function can achieve more than the pure impedance function in aspects of converging to the desired value and reducing the force overshoots. The performance of force overshoots suppression and force tracking error are maintained by introducing the dynamic adaptive sigma adjustment function. The simulation and experimental results both show the achieved control performance by comparing with the previous control methods. Practical implications The implementation of the controller is easy and convenient in practical manufacture scenes that require force control using industrial robots. Originality/value A superior robot controller adapting to a variety of complex tasks owing to the following characteristics: maintenance of high-accuracy position tracking capability in free-space (basic capabilities of modern industrial robots); maintenance of high speed, stability and smooth contact performance in collision stage; and presentation of high-precision force tracking capability in steady contact.},

Although many processes of a high energy consumption (e.g., chemical, heating, etc.) are considered to have reached high levels of efficiency, this is not the case for many other industrial manufacturing activities. Indeed, this is the case for robotic and automatic systems, for which, in the past, the minimization of energy demand was not considered a design objective. The proper design and operation of industrial robots and automation systems represent a great opportunity for reducing energy consumption in the industry, for example, by the substitution with more efficient systems and the energy optimization of operation. This review paper classifies and analyses several methodologies and technologies that have been developed with the aim of providing a reference of existing methods, techniques and technologies for enhancing the energy performance of industrial robotic and mechatronic systems.

This suggests that social robotics should endow robots with similar competences for commitment management in order to achieve the objective of performing joint tasks in human-robot interactions. In this paper, we examine two philosophical approaches to commitments. These approaches, we argue, emphasize different behavioral and cognitive aspects of commitments that give roboticists a way to give meaning to monitoring and pro-active signaling in joint action with human partners. To show that, we present an example of use-case with guiding robots and we sketch a framework that can be used to explore the type of capacities and behaviors that a robot may need to manage commitments.},

  abstract = {Multibody simulation with frictional contact has been a challenging subject of research for the past thirty years. Rigidbody assumptions are commonly used to approximate the physics of contact, and together with Coulomb friction, lead to challengingto-solve nonlinear complementarity problems (NCP). On the other hand, robot grippers often introduce significant compliance. Compliant contact, combined with regularized friction, can be modeled entirely with ODEs, avoiding NCP solves. Unfortunately, regularized friction introduces high-frequency stiff dynamics and even implicit methods struggle with these systems, especially during slip-stick transitions. To improve the performance of implicit integration for these systems we introduce a Transition-Aware Line Search (TALS), which greatly improves the convergence of the Newton-Raphson iterations performed by implicit integrators. We find that TALS works best with semi-implicit integration, but that the explicit treatment of normal compliance can be problematic. To address this, we develop a Transition-Aware Modified SemiImplicit (TAMSI) integrator that has similar computational cost to semi-implicit methods but implicitly couples compliant contact forces, leading to a more robust method. We evaluate the robustness, accuracy and performance of TAMSI and demonstrate our approach alongside relevant sim-to-real manipulation tasks.},

Previous methods either train a new skill for every different goal or do not infer the specific target in the presence of multiple goals from visual data. We introduce an end-to-end method that represents targetable visuomotor skills as a goal-parameterized neural network policy. By training on an informative subset of available goals with the associated target parameters, we are able to learn a policy that can zero-shot generalize to previously unseen goals. We evaluate our method in a representative 2D simulation of a button-grid and on both button-pressing and peg-insertion tasks on two different physical arms. We demonstrate that our model trained on 33\% of the possible goals is able to generalize to more than 90\% of the targets in the scene for both simulation and robot experiments. We also successfully learn a mapping from target pixel coordinates to a robot policy to complete a specified goal.},

Conditions for coupled stability are developed based on this measure of admittance error, which result in restrictions on allowable environmental characteristics. When environmental conditions for the manipulator are known, the admittance error can be used as a control design specification. Alternatively, the admittance error can be used to measure performance of an existing system, providing a guide to mechanical interface design. A simple example is used to illustrate this approach},

This survey article focuses on the extreme other end of the spectrum: how can a robot adapt with only a handful of trials (a dozen) and a few minutes? By analogy with the word "big-data", we refer to this challenge as "micro-data reinforcement learning". We show that a first strategy is to leverage prior knowledge on the policy structure (e.g., dynamic movement primitives), on the policy parameters (e.g., demonstrations), or on the dynamics (e.g., simulators). A second strategy is to create data-driven surrogate models of the expected reward (e.g., Bayesian optimization) or the dynamical model (e.g., model-based policy search), so that the policy optimizer queries the model instead of the real system. Overall, all successful micro-data algorithms combine these two strategies by varying the kind of model and prior knowledge. The current scientific challenges essentially revolve around scaling up to complex robots (e.g., humanoids), designing generic priors, and optimizing the computing time.},

Unfortunately, optimizing this objective is intractable, and myopic (greedy) approximations are known to perform poorly. In this paper, we introduce DIRECT, an efficient yet near-optimal algorithm for nonmyopically optimizing value of information. Crucially, DIRECT uses a novel surrogate objective that is: (1) aligned with the value of information problem (2) efficient to evaluate and (3) adaptive submodular. This latter property enables us to utilize an efficient greedy optimization while providing strong approximation guarantees. We demonstrate the utility of our approach on four diverse case-studies: touch-based robotic localization, comparison-based preference learning, wild-life conservation management, and preference elicitation in behavioral economics. In the first application, we demonstrate DIRECT in closed-loop on an actual robotic platform.},

It is also prohibitively expensive to learn a new policy from scratch for each robot hardware due to the high sample complexity of modern state-of-the-art algorithms. We propose a novel approach called Hardware Conditioned Policies where we train a universal policy conditioned on a vector representation of robot hardware. We considered robots in simulation with varied dynamics, kinematic structure, kinematic lengths and degrees-of-freedom. First, we use the kinematic structure directly as the hardware encoding and show great zero-shot transfer to completely novel robots not seen during training. For robots with lower zero-shot success rate, we also demonstrate that fine-tuning the policy network is significantly more sample-efficient than training a model from scratch. In tasks where knowing the agent dynamics is important for success, we learn an embedding for robot hardware and show that policies conditioned on the encoding of hardware tend to generalize and transfer well.

However, because of the modeling difficulty and low efficiency of the existing solutions, this task is usually performed offline. In this paper, an online parameter optimization method is developed. Gaussian Process Regression(GPR) is utilized to model the relationship between the process parameters and system performance. The GPR surrogated Bayesian Optimization Algorithm(GPRBOA) is proposed to optimize the process parameters. To reduce the risk of converging to a local minimum, a random variation factor is added to the Lower Confidence Bound(LCB) acquisition function to balance the exploration and exploitation processes. To deal with the computational burden of GPR, a switching criterion is proposed to coordinate the optimization process and production process to reduce the computational complexity. Experiments were performed using a peg-in-hole process. The experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its efficiency and accuracy compared to Design Of Experiment(DOE) methods. The proposed method is the first attempt of model-driven assembly process parameter optimization and will generate big economic impact.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms have found limited success beyond simulated applications, and one main reason is the absence of safety guarantees during the learning process. Real world systems would realistically fail or break before an optimal controller can be learned. To address this issue, we propose a controller architecture that combines (1) a model-free RL-based controller with (2) model-based controllers utilizing control barrier functions (CBFs) and (3) on-line learning of the unknown system dynamics, in order to ensure safety during learning. Our general framework leverages the success of RL algorithms to learn high-performance controllers, while the CBF-based controllers both guarantee safety and guide the learning process by constraining the set of explorable polices. We utilize Gaussian Processes (GPs) to model the system dynamics and its uncertainties. Our novel controller synthesis algorithm, RL-CBF, guarantees safety with high probability during the learning process, regardless of the RL algorithm used, and demonstrates greater policy exploration efficiency. We test our algorithm on (1) control of an inverted pendulum and (2) autonomous car-following with wireless vehicle-to-vehicle communication, and show that our algorithm attains much greater sample efficiency in learning than other state-of-the-art algorithms and maintains safety during the entire learning process.},

  abstract = {This paper deals with the class of robotic assemblies where position uncertainty far exceeds assembly clearance, and visual assistance is not available to resolve the uncertainty. Under this scenario, we can implement a localization strategy that resolves the uncertainty using a pre-acquired map of all possible peg-hole contact configurations. Prior to assembly, the strategy explores the contact configuration space (C-space) by sequentially bringing the peg (under different configurations) into contact with the stationary (fixtured) hole and matching the contact configurations thus recorded with the map. The different peg configurations can be actively chosen to maximize uncertainty-reduction. However, with a sampled map of the contact C-space, discretization errors are introduced, and implementing deterministic matching (at the fine-grained level necessary for assembly) would soon become prohibitively expensive in terms of computation. Additionally, with global initial uncertainty, multiple solutions abound in our localization problem. In this paper, we introduce a particle filter implementation which can not only handle the discretization errors in map-matching, but also track multiple solutions simultaneously. The particle filter implementation was validated on computer simulations of round and square peg-in-hole assemblies, before testing it on corresponding actual robotic assemblies. The implementation was highly successful on both the assemblies, reducing the uncertainty by more than 95 \% and making it easy for a previously-devised compliant strategy to achieve assembly. Results from the simulations and actual assemblies are reported. We also present a comparison of these results (using random localization: peg moves selected randomly) with preliminary results from assemblies using active localization.},

Given safe demonstrations, our method uses hit-and-run sampling to obtain lower cost, and thus unsafe, trajectories. Both safe and unsafe trajectories are used to obtain a consistent representation of the unsafe set via solving an integer program. Our method generalizes across system dynamics and learns a guaranteed subset of the constraint. We also provide theoretical analysis on what subset of the constraint can be learnable from safe demonstrations. We demonstrate our method on linear and nonlinear system dynamics, show that it can be modified to work with suboptimal demonstrations, and that it can also be used to learn constraints in a feature space.},

In the context of HRI, part of the world to be modeled is the human. One option is for the robot to treat the human as a black box and learn a policy for how they act directly. But it can also model the human as an agent, and rely on a "theory of mind" to guide or bias the learning (grey box). We contribute a characterization of the performance of these methods under the optimistic case of having an ideal theory of mind, as well as under different scenarios in which the assumptions behind the robot's theory of mind for the human are wrong, as they inevitably will be in practice. We find that there is a significant sample complexity advantage to theory of mind methods and that they are more robust to covariate shift, but that when enough interaction data is available, black box approaches eventually dominate.},

  abstract = {The stable, quantization-error noise-free, rendering of high-stiffness dynamics can be challenging using impedance-type haptic displays. In this paper we examine a canonical, one degree of freedom, haptic display rendering a virtual spring and damper, including the effects of the device and human dynamics, sampling, position quantization, time delay, and the low-pass filter operating on the device velocity estimate. We construct various stability and quantization-error regions as a function of the system parameters and show the necessary trade-offs that occur between them. Although we apply the quantization-error analysis to virtual spring and damper rendering, it applies to a general virtual environment. We present sufficiency for quantization-error passivity, necessity for no malicious-touch limit cycles, and necessity for no uncoupled-touch limit cycles. Using these results, aided by the presented supplementary code, we find control parameters to render the largest, renderable, virtual stiffness for a given haptic display. The analytical results are experimentally verified using a Phantom Premium 1.5 haptic device.},

Neurophysiol. 78: 554–560, 1997. The purpose of this study was to investigate the learning mechanisms underlying motor adaptation of arm movements to externally applied perturbing forces. We considered two alternative hypotheses. According to one, adaptation occurs through the learning of a mapping between the states (positions and velocities) visited by the arm and the forces experienced at those states. The alternative hypothesis is that adaptation occurs through the memorization of the temporal sequence of forces experienced along specific trajectories. The first mechanism corresponds to developing a model of the dynamics of the environment, whereas the second is a form of “rote learning.” Both types of learning would lead to the recovery of the unperturbed performance. We have tested these hypotheses by examining how adaptation is transferred across different types of movements. Our results indicate that 1) adaptation to an externally applied force field occurs with different classes of movements including but not limited to reaching movements and 2) adaptation generalizes across different movements that visit the same regions of the external field. These findings are not compatible with the hypothesis of rote learning. Instead, they are consistent with the hypothesis that adaptation to changes in movement dynamics is achieved by a module that learns to reproduce the structure of the environmental field as an association between visited states and experienced forces, independent of the kinematics of the movements made during adaptation.},

  abstract = {This study stemmed from the observation that the brain of human as well as nonhuman primates is capable of forming and memorizing remarkably accurate internal representations of the dynamics of the arm. These dynamics establish a functional relation between applied force and ensuing arm motion, a relation that generally is quite complex and nonlinear. Current evidence shows that the motor control system is capable of adapting to perturbing forces that depend on motion variables such as position, velocity, and acceleration. The experiments we report here were aimed at establishing whether or not the motor system also may adapt to forces that depend explicitly on time rather than on motion variables. Surprisingly, the experiments suggest a negative answer. When asked to compensate for a predictable and repeated time-varying pattern of disturbing forces, subjects learned to counteract the disturbance by producing forces that did not depend on time but on the velocity and the position of the arm. We conclude from this evidence that time and time-dependent dynamics are not explicitly represented within the neural structures that are responsible for motor adaptation. Although our findings are not sufficient to rule out the presence of a timing structure within the central nervous system, they are consistent with other investigations that conspicuously failed to find evidence for such a central clock.},

  abstract = {Control barrier functions have been demonstrated to be a useful method of ensuring constraint satisfaction for a wide class of controllers, however existing results are mostly restricted to continuous time systems of relative degree one. Mechanical systems, including robots, are typically second-order systems in which the control occurs at the force/torque level. These systems have velocity and position constraints (i.e. relative degree two) that are vital for safety and/or task execution. Additionally, mechanical systems are typically controlled digitally as sampled-data systems. The contribution of this work is two-fold. First, is the development of novel, robust control barrier functions that ensure constraint satisfaction for relative degree two, sampled-data systems in the presence of model uncertainty. Second, is the application of the proposed method to the challenging problem of robotic grasping in which a robotic hand must ensure an object remains inside the grasp while manipulating it to a desired reference trajectory. A grasp constraint satisfying controller is proposed that can admit existing nominal manipulation controllers from the literature, while simultaneously ensuring no slip, no over-extension (e.g. singular configurations), and no rolling off of the fingertips. Simulation and experimental results validate the proposed control for the robotic hand application.},

Still, creating a robot application requires relatively deep robot programming knowledge, and is time consuming. For decades, the robotics community has been working on approaches for supporting robot programming on a task-oriented level i.e. defining the robot tasks rather than motion. One of them is introducing robot skills, which are robot functions representing robot capabilities to perform certain tasks. However, existing robot skill models involve knowledge and control policies that are usually complex and difficult to implement, as well as not easy to use by application engineers. To achieve practically usable results, we focus on assembly applications and introduce a relatively simple control policy for robotic skills utilizing compliant motion control. Furthermore, we propose a software concept for application programming based on such robot skills and demonstrate its feasibility with test implementations.},

  abstract = {Manipulation skills involving contact and friction are inherent to many robotics tasks. Using the class of motor primitives for peg-in-hole like insertions, we study how robots can learn such skills. Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMP) are a popular way of extracting such policies through behaviour cloning (BC) but can struggle in the context of insertion. Policy adaptation strategies such as residual learning can help improve the overall performance of policies in the context of contactrich manipulation. However, it is not clear how to best do this with DMPs. As a result, we consider several possible ways for adapting a DMP formulation and propose “residual Learning from Demonstration“ (rLfD), a framework that combines DMPs with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to learn a residual correction policy. Our evaluations suggest that applying residual learning directly in task space and operating on the full pose of the robot can significantly improve the overall performance of DMPs. We show that rLfD offers a gentle to the joints solution that improves the task success and generalisation of DMPs and enables transfer to different geometries and frictions through few-shot task adaptation. The proposed framework is evaluated on a set of tasks. A simulated robot and a physical robot have to successfully insert pegs, gears and plugs into their respective sockets.

Contact states are modeled by constraint equations parametrized by timedependent sensor data and time-independent object properties. At each sampling time, multiple model estimation is used to assess the most likely contact state. The assessment is performed by a hidden Markov model, which combines a measure of how well each set of constraint equations fits the sensor data with the probability of specific contact state transitions. The latter is embodied in a task-based contact state network. The approach is illustrated for a three-dimensional peg-in-hole insertion using a tabletop manipulator robot. Using only position sensing, the contact state sequence is successfully estimated without knowledge of nominal property values. Property estimates are obtained for the peg dimensions as well as the hole position and orientation.},

  abstract = {Autonomous learning has been a promising direction in control and robotics for more than a decade since data-driven learning allows to reduce the amount of engineering knowledge, which is otherwise required. However, autonomous reinforcement learning (RL) approaches typically require many interactions with the system to learn controllers, which is a practical limitation in real systems, such as robots, where many interactions can be impractical and time consuming. To address this problem, current learning approaches typically require task-specific knowledge in form of expert demonstrations, realistic simulators, pre-shaped policies, or specific knowledge about the underlying dynamics. In this article, we follow a different approach and speed up learning by extracting more information from data. In particular, we learn a probabilistic, non-parametric Gaussian process transition model of the system. By explicitly incorporating model uncertainty into long-term planning and controller learning our approach reduces the effects of model errors, a key problem in model-based learning. Compared to state-of-the art RL our model-based policy search method achieves an unprecedented speed of learning. We demonstrate its applicability to autonomous learning in real robot and control tasks.},

Designed to embody safe and natural behaviors, they rely on compliant physical structures purposefully designed to embody desirable and sometimes variable impedance characteristics. This article discusses the problem of controlling SRs. We start by observing that most of the standard methods of robotic control-e.g., high-gain robust control, feedback linearization, backstepping, and active impedance control-effectively fight against or even completely cancel the physical dynamics of the system, replacing them with a desired model. This defeats the purpose of introducing physical compliance. After all, what is the point of building soft actuators if we then make them stiff by control?},

The internal blocks within such systems are restricted only to be causal mappings, but are allowed to be non-linear, stochastic and time varying. Moreover, the involved signals can be arbitrarily distributed. We bound the directed information between signals inside the feedback loop by the mutual information between signals inside and outside the feedback loop. This fundamental result has an interesting interpretation as a law of conservation of information flow. Building upon it, we derive several novel identities and inequalities, which allow us to prove some existing information inequalities under less restrictive assumptions. Finally, we establish new relationships between nested directed informations inside a feedback loop. This yields a new and general data-processing inequality for systems with feedback.},

They also describe a technique for identifying contact formations in spite of errors in sensing and geometric uncertainties. It is impossible to verify termination conditions in general. The notion of design constraints is introduced, and design constraints for which verification can be guaranteed are formulated. The constraints are reasonable in the sense that they do not impose unrealistic conditions on typical designs. Results of implementation on a robot system consisting of PUMA robot with RTI force/torque sensors support the theoretical derivations and show empirically that the theoretical constraints can be relaxed somewhat and good results still be obtained.{$<<$}ETX{$>>$}},

In the immediate future, metrics related to safety and dependability have to be found in order to successfully introduce robots in everyday enviornments. While there are certainly also “cognitive” issues involved, due to the human perception of the robot (and vice versa), and other objective metrics related to fault detection and isolation, our discussion focuses on the peculiar aspects of “physical” interaction with robots. In particular, safety and dependability are the underlying evaluation criteria for mechanical design, actuation, and control architectures. Mechanical and control issues are discussed with emphasis on techniques that provide safety in an intrinsic way or by means of control components. Attention is devoted to dependability, mainly related to sensors, control architectures, and fault handling and tolerance. Suggestions are provided to draft metrics for evaluating safety and dependability in pHRI, and references to the works of the scientific groups involved in the pHRI research complete the study. The present atlas is a result of the EURON perspective research project “Physical Human–Robot Interaction in anthropic DOMains (PHRIDOM)”, aimed at charting the new territory of pHRI, and constitutes the scientific basis for the ongoing STReP project “Physical Human–Robot Interaction: depENDability and Safety (PHRIENDS)”, aimed at developing key components for the next generation of robots, designed to share their environment with people.},

The approach integrates both instantaneous task specification and estimation of geometric uncertainty in a unified framework. Major components are the use of feature coordinates, defined with respect to object and feature frames, which facilitate the task specification, and the introduction of uncertainty coordinates to model geometric uncertainty. While the focus of the paper is on task specification, an existing velocity based control scheme is reformulated in terms of these feature and uncertainty coordinates. This control scheme compensates for the effect of time varying uncertainty coordinates. Constraint weighting results in an invariant robot behavior in case of conflicting constraints with heterogeneous units.},

The stability of the admittance controller is mainly threatened by a stiff environment. Many methods that guarantee stability in arbitrary environments, impose conservative control gains that limit the effectiveness of the cooperation. Inspired by previous work in frequency domain stability observers, a method is proposed in this paper to detect unstable behavior and stabilize the robot with online adaptation of the admittance control gains. The introduced instability index is based on frequency domain analysis, which very quickly detects unstable behavior by monitoring high frequency oscillation in the force signal. To treat the instability, an adaptation scheme of the admittance parameters is proposed, that relaxes conservative gains and improves the cooperation by considering the effect of variable admittance on the operators' effort. We investigate two human-robot co-manipulation tasks; cooperation within a zero stiffness environment and cooperation in contact with a stiff double-wall virtual environment. The proposed methods are validated experimentally with a number of subjects in cooperation with an LWR manipulator.},

  abstract = {Designing rewards for Reinforcement Learning (RL) is challenging because it needs to convey the desired task, be efficient to optimize, and be easy to compute. The latter is particularly problematic when applying RL to robotics, where detecting whether the desired configuration is reached might require considerable supervision and instrumentation. Furthermore, we are often interested in being able to reach a wide range of configurations, hence setting up a different reward every time might be unpractical. Methods like Hindsight Experience Replay (HER) have recently shown promise to learn policies able to reach many goals, without the need of a reward. Unfortunately, without tricks like resetting to points along the trajectory, HER might require many samples to discover how to reach certain areas of the state-space. In this work we investigate different approaches to incorporate demonstrations to drastically speed up the convergence to a policy able to reach any goal, also surpassing the performance of an agent trained with other Imitation Learning algorithms. Furthermore, we show our method can also be used when the available expert trajectories do not contain the actions, which can leverage kinesthetic or third person demonstration.

We propose a new way for grasp representation in the task space, which provides a suitable basis for grasp imitation learning. Inspired by neuroscientific findings, finger movement synergies in the task space together with fingertip positions are used to derive a parametric low-dimensional grasp representation. Taking into account correlating finger movements, we describe grasps using a system of virtual springs to connect the fingers, where different grasp types are defined by parameterizing the spring constants. Based on such continuous parameterization, all instantiation of grasp types and all hand preshapes during a grasping action (reach, preshape, enclose, open) can be represented. We present experimental results, in which the spring constants are merely estimated from fingertip motion tracking using a stereo camera setup of a humanoid robot. The results show that the generated grasps based on the proposed representation are similar to the observed grasps.},

  abstract = {We consider the problem of determining the information requirements to perform robot tasks, using the concept of information invariants. This paper represents our attempt to characterize a family of complicated and subtle issues concerned with measuring robot task complexity. We also provide a first approximation to a purely operational theory that addresses a narrow but interesting special case. We discuss several measures for the information complexity of a task: (a) How much internal state should the robot retain? (b) How many cooperating agents are required, and how much communication between them is necessary? (c) How can the robot change (side-effect) the environment in order to record state or sensory information to perform a task? (d) How much information is provided by sensors? and (e) How much computation is required by the robot? We consider how one might develop a kind of “calculus” on (a)–(e) in order to compare the power of sensor systems analytically. To this end, we attempt to develop a notion of information invariants. We develop a theory whereby one sensor can be “reduced” to another (much in the spirit of computation-theoretic reductions), by adding, deleting, and reallocating (a)–(e) among collaborating autonomous agents.},

  abstract = {The ideas of continental philosopher Martin Heidegger have been influential in cognitive science and artificial intelligence, despite the fact that there has been no effort to analyze these ideas empirically. The experiments reported here are designed to lend empirical support to Heidegger’s phenomenology and more specifically his description of the transition between ready-to-hand and unready-to-hand modes in interactions with tools. In experiment 1, we found that a smoothly coping cognitive system exhibits 1=f b type positively correlated noise and that its correlated character is reduced when the system is perturbed. This indicates that the participant and tool constitute a self-assembled, extended device during smooth coping and this device is disrupted by the perturbation. In experiment 2, we examine the re-organization of awareness that occurs when a smoothly coping, self-assembled, extended cognitive system is perturbed. We found that the disruption is accompanied by a change in attention which interferes with participants’ performance on a simultaneous cognitive task. Together these experiments show that a smoothly coping participant-tool system can be temporarily disrupted and that this disruption causes a change in the participant’s awareness. Since these two events follow as predictions from Heidegger’s work, our study offers evidence for the hypothesized transition from readiness-to-hand to unreadiness-to-hand.},

  abstract = {In shared control teleoperation, the robot assists the user in accomplishing the desired task, making teleoperation easier and more seamless. Rather than simply executing the user’s input, which is hindered by the inadequacies of the interface, the robot attempts to predict the user’s intent, and assists in accomplishing it. In this work, we are interested in the scientific underpinnings of assistance: we propose an intuitive formalism that captures assistance as policy blending, illustrate how some of the existing techniques for shared control instantiate it, and provide a principled analysis of its main components: prediction of user intent and its arbitration with the user input. We define the prediction problem, with foundations in inverse reinforcement learning, discuss simplifying assumptions that make it tractable, and test these on data from users teleoperating a robotic manipulator. We define the arbitration problem from a control-theoretic perspective, and turn our attention to what users consider good arbitration. We conduct a user study that analyzes the effect of different factors on the performance of assistance, indicating that arbitration should be contextual: it should depend on the robot’s confidence in itself and in the user, and even the particulars of the user. Based on the study, we discuss challenges and opportunities that a robot sharing the control with the user might face: adaptation to the context and the user, legibility of behavior, and the closed loop between prediction and user behavior.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel data-driven method for learning deep constrained continuous control policies and dynamical models of linear systems. By leveraging partial knowledge of system dynamics and constraint enforcing multi-objective loss functions, the method can learn from small and static datasets, handle time-varying state and input constraints and enforce the stability properties of the controlled system. We use a continuous control design example to demonstrate the performance of the method on three distinct tasks: system identification, control policy learning, and simultaneous system identification and policy learning. We assess the system identification performance by comparing open-loop simulations of the true system and the learned models. We demonstrate the performance of the policy learning methodology in closed-loop simulations using the system model affected by varying levels of parametric and additive uncertainties. We report superior performance in terms of reference tracking, robustness, and online computational and memory footprints compared with classical control approaches, namely LQR and LQI controllers, and with three variants of model predictive control (MPC) formulations and two traditional MPC solution approaches. We then evaluate the potential of simultaneously learning the system model and control policy. Our empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of our unifying framework for constrained optimal control of linear systems to provide stability guarantees of the learned dynamics, robustness to uncertainty, and high sampling efficiency.},

However, much of the research advances in RL are often hard to leverage in real-world systems due to a series of assumptions that are rarely satisfied in practice. We present a set of nine unique challenges that must be addressed to productionize RL to real world problems. For each of these challenges, we specify the exact meaning of the challenge, present some approaches from the literature, and specify some metrics for evaluating that challenge. An approach that addresses all nine challenges would be applicable to a large number of real world problems.

  abstract = {Prediction is an appealing objective for self-supervised learning of behavioral skills, particularly for autonomous robots. However, effectively utilizing predictive models for control, especially with raw image inputs, poses a number of major challenges. How should the predictions be used? What happens when they are inaccurate? In this paper, we tackle these questions by proposing a method for learning robotic skills from raw image observations, using only autonomously collected experience. We show that even an imperfect model can complete complex tasks if it can continuously retry, but this requires the model to not lose track of the objective (e.g., the object of interest). To enable a robot to continuously retry a task, we devise a self-supervised algorithm for learning image registration, which can keep track of objects of interest for the duration of the trial. We demonstrate that this idea can be combined with a video-prediction based controller to enable complex behaviors to be learned from scratch using only raw visual inputs, including grasping, repositioning objects, and non-prehensile manipulation. Our real-world experiments demonstrate that a model trained with 160 robot hours of autonomously collected, unlabeled data is able to successfully perform complex manipulation tasks with a wide range of objects not seen during training.},

Quantification of neuromechanical parameters describing joint impedance improves understanding of human movement control and is of clinical relevance for diagnostics and treatment monitoring of patients suffering from movement disorders. For large rotations and/or changing activation of the muscles linear time invariant (LTI) identification techniques no longer suffice because the parameters describing the system are not constant over time. To identify joint impedance over a large working range nonlinear or time variant identification techniques are thus required. Time-variant damping and stiffness of the human wrist joint were estimated in a pilot experiment. The proposed method performed well, as shown by high VAF values indicating the suitability of LPV subspace identification for describing time-varying joint impedance.},

Therefore, we can now use the many results and design tools from control theory to design feedback communication schemes providing desired communication rates, and to generate lower bounds on the channel feedback capacity. We consider single user Gaussian channels with memory and memory-less multiuser broadcast, multiple access, and interference channels. In all cases, the results we obtain either achieve the feedback capacity, when this is known, recover known best rates, or provide new best achievable rates.},

We consider the problem of extracting a low-dimensional description of the manipulated environment in form of a kinematic model. This allows us to transfer a skill by defining a policy on a prototype model and morphing the observed environment to this prototype. A deep neural network is used to map depth image observations of the environment to morphing parameter, which include transformation and configuration parameters of the prototype model. Using the concatenation property of affine transformations and the ability to convert point clouds to depth images allows to apply the network in an iterative manner. The network is trained on data generated in a simulator and on augmented data that is created by using network predictions. The algorithm is evaluated on different tasks, where it is shown that iterative predictions lead to a higher accuracy than one-step predictions.},

A series of lumped-parameter models is developed in an effort to predict the closed-loop dynamics of a force-controlled single-axis arm. The models include some effects of robot structural dynamics, sensor compliance, and workpiece dynamics. The qualitative analysis shows that the robot dynamics contribute to force-controlled instability. Recommendations are made for models to be used in control system design.},

Our approach to grasping also considers environmental shape adaptability to select grasps with high probability of success. We validate the proposed shape-adaptability-aware grasping approach in 880 real-world grasping trials with 30 objects. Our experiments show that the explicit consideration of shape adaptability of the hand leads to robust grasping of unknown objects. Simple perception suffices to achieve this robust grasping behavior.},

Under this control, a robot can successfully achieve contact tasks without changing the control algorithm or controller gains throughout all three modes: free space, transition and constrained motion. It uses a robust hybrid impedance/time-delay control algorithm to first absorb impact forces and stabilize the system. This control input alternates with zero when no environment force is sensed due to loss of contact. This alternation of control action repeats until the impact transient subsides and steady state is attained. After impact transient, the hybrid impedance/time-delay control algorithm is again utilized. This bang-bang control method provides stable interaction between a robot with severe nonlinear joint friction and a stiff environment, and achieves rapid response while minimizing force overshoots. During contact transition, we employ one simple control algorithm that switches only to zero and maintains the same gains, while other controllers use more than one control algorithm or different control gains. It is shown via experiments that overall performance is superior or comparable to more complicated existing impact force control techniques.},

In each case, observations of people's past choices can inform our inferences about their likes and preferences. If we assume that choices are approximately optimal according to some utility function, we can treat preference inference as Bayesian inverse planning. That is, given a prior on utility functions and some observed choices, we invert an optimal decision-making process to infer a posterior distribution on utility functions. However, people often deviate from approximate optimality. They have false beliefs, their planning is sub-optimal, and their choices may be temporally inconsistent due to hyperbolic discounting and other biases. We demonstrate how to incorporate these deviations into algorithms for preference inference by constructing generative models of planning for agents who are subject to false beliefs and time inconsistency. We explore the inferences these models make about preferences, beliefs, and biases. We present a behavioral experiment in which human subjects perform preference inference given the same observations of choices as our model. Results show that human subjects (like our model) explain choices in terms of systematic deviations from optimal behavior and suggest that they take such deviations into account when inferring preferences.},

The physical collaborative interaction is then described only with two distinct homotopy time-functions that vary independently. These functions can likely describe the signature of a collaborative task. A virtual reality haptic set-up is used to assess the proposed theory.},

  abstract = {The understanding of human arm stiffness have brought several significant advances to robotics. For the most part, the end-point stiffness of human arm serves as an important role in guiding and shaping the Cartesian stiffness of robot arm in the execution of complicated interaction tasks because of the convenience of using the common space where both stiffnesses function. However, investigation of the joint stiffness of human arm, on the other hand, will provide a more comprehensive perspective on the human arm stiffness and enable other appealing robotic applications, for instance, whole-arm interaction with unstructured environment. As a fundamental research for these applications, the feasibility of an online joint stiffness transfer approach from human to anthropomorphic arms is discussed in this paper. This is realized by a proposed concept of physiological joint stiffness, which is shared by the human and anthropomorphic arms. The desired joint stiffness of robot arm is transformed from the estimated joint stiffness of human arm by requiring both arms to have the same apparent physiological joint stiffness. To make the calculated joint stiffness achievable in a robot controller, the stiffness matrix is subsequently optimized to be symmetric and positive definite. Proof-of-concept experiment is performed on a fully integrated robotic teleoperation setup to validate the efficacy of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {Design of adaptive algorithms for simultaneous regulation and estimation of MIMO linear dynamical systems is a canonical reinforcement learning problem. Efficient policies whose regret (i.e. increase in the cost due to uncertainty) scales at a square-root rate of time have been studied extensively in the recent literature. Nevertheless, existing strategies are computationally intractable and require a priori knowledge of key system parameters. The only exception is a randomized Greedy regulator, for which asymptotic regret bounds have been recently established. However, randomized Greedy leads to probable fluctuations in the trajectory of the system, which renders its finite time regret suboptimal. This work addresses the above issues by designing policies that utilize input signals perturbations. We show that perturbed Greedy guarantees non-asymptotic regret bounds of (nearly) square-root magnitude w.r.t. time. More generally, we establish high probability bounds on both the regret and the learning accuracy under arbitrary input perturbations. The settings where Greedy attains the information theoretic lower bound of logarithmic regret are also discussed. To obtain the results, state-of-the-art tools from martingale theory together with the recently introduced method of policy decomposition are leveraged. Beside adaptive regulators, analysis of input perturbations captures key applications including remote sensing and distributed control.},

Analytical rigid-body contact models are used extensively in planning and control due to their computational efficiency and simplicity, yet despite their prevalence, little if any empirical comparison of these models has been made and it is unclear how well they approximate contact outcomes. In this paper, we first formulate a system identification approach for six commonly used contact models in the literature, and use the proposed method to find parameters for an experimental data-set of impacts. Next, we compare the models empirically, and establish a task specific upper bound on the performance of the models and the rigid-body contact model paradigm. We highlight the limitations of these models, salient failure modes, and the care that should be taken in parameter selection, which are ultimately difficult to give a physical interpretation.},

  abstract = {In this work we seek for an approach to integrate safety in the learning process that relies on a partly known state-space model of the system and regards the unknown dynamics as an additive bounded disturbance. We introduce a framework for safely learning a control strategy for a given system with an additive disturbance. On the basis of the known part of the model, a safe set in which the system can learn safely, the algorithm can choose optimal actions for pursuing the target set as long as the safety-preserving condition is satisfied. After some learning episodes, the disturbance can be updated based on real-world data. To this end, Gaussian Process regression is conducted on the collected disturbance samples. Since the unstable nature of the law of the real world, for example, change of friction or conductivity with the temperature, we expect to have the more robust solution of optimal control problem. For evaluation of approach described above we choose an inverted pendulum as a benchmark model. The proposed algorithm manages to learn a policy that does not violate the pre-specified safety constraints. Observed performance is improved when it was incorporated exploration set up to make sure that an optimal policy is learned everywhere in the safe set. Finally, we outline some promising directions for future research beyond the scope of this paper.},

In this paper, we present and evaluate a decisiontheoretic framework that captures the general notion of intelligent assistance. The objective is to observe a goaldirected agent and to select assistive actions in order to minimize the overall cost. We formulate the problem as an assistant POMDP where the hidden state corresponds to the agent’s unobserved goals. This formulation allows us to exploit (partial) domain models for both estimating the agent’s goals and selecting assistive action. In addition, the formulation naturally handles uncertainty, varying action costs, and customization to specific agents via learning. We argue that in many domains myopic heuristics will be adequate for selecting actions in the assistant POMDP and present two such heuristics—one based on MDP planning, and another based on policy rollout. We evaluate our approach in two domains where human subjects perform tasks in game-like computer environments. The results show that the assistant substantially reduces user effort with only a modest computational effort.},

While it presents numerous advantages with respect to other robot imitation frameworks in terms of generalization and portability, final robot joint trajectories for the execution of actions are not necessarily encoded within the model. This is studied as an optimization problem, and the solution is computed through evolutionary algorithms in simulated environments. Evolutionary algorithms require a large number of evaluations, which had made the use of these algorithms in real world applications very challenging. This paper presents online evolutionary strategies, as a change of paradigm within CGDA execution. Online evolutionary strategies shift and merge motor execution into the planning loop. A concrete online evolutionary strategy, Online Evolved Trajectories (OET), is presented. OET drastically reduces computational times between motor executions, and enables working in real world dynamic environments and/or with human collaboration. Its performance has been measured against Full Trajectory Evolution (FTE) and Incrementally Evolved Trajectories (IET), obtaining the best overall results. Experimental evaluations are performed on the TEO full-sized humanoid robot with "paint" and "iron" actions that together involve vision, kinesthetic and force features.},

Different impedance modulation strategies, which take into account the human's behavior during the interaction, are selected with the support of a simulation study and then experimentally tested on a 7-degree-of-freedom KUKA LWR4. A comparative study to establish the most effective redundancy resolution strategy has been made by evaluating different solutions compatible with the considered task. The experiments have shown that the redundancy, when used to ensure a decoupled apparent inertia at the end effector, allows enlarging the stability region in the impedance parameters space and improving the performance. On the other hand, the variable impedance with a suitable modulation strategy for parameters' tuning outperforms the constant impedance, in the sense that it enhances the comfort perceived by humans during manual guidance and allows reaching a favorable compromise between accuracy and execution time.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning provides a powerful and flexible framework for automated acquisition of robotic motion skills. However, applying reinforcement learning requires a sufficiently detailed representation of the state, including the configuration of task-relevant objects. We present an approach that automates state-space construction by learning a state representation directly from camera images. Our method uses a deep spatial autoencoder to acquire a set of feature points that describe the environment for the current task, such as the positions of objects, and then learns a motion skill with these feature points using an efficient reinforcement learning method based on local linear models. The resulting controller reacts continuously to the learned feature points, allowing the robot to dynamically manipulate objects in the world with closed-loop control. We demonstrate our method with a PR2 robot on tasks that include pushing a free-standing toy block, picking up a bag of rice using a spatula, and hanging a loop of rope on a hook at various positions. In each task, our method automatically learns to track task-relevant objects and manipulate their configuration with the robot's arm.},

  abstract = {A core challenge for an agent learning to interact with the world is to predict how its actions affect objects in its environment. Many existing methods for learning the dynamics of physical interactions require labeled object information. However, to scale real-world interaction learning to a variety of scenes and objects, acquiring labeled data becomes increasingly impractical. To learn about physical object motion without labels, we develop an action-conditioned video prediction model that explicitly models pixel motion, by predicting a distribution over pixel motion from previous frames. Because our model explicitly predicts motion, it is partially invariant to object appearance, enabling it to generalize to previously unseen objects. To explore video prediction for real-world interactive agents, we also introduce a dataset of 59,000 robot interactions involving pushing motions, including a test set with novel objects. In this dataset, accurate prediction of videos conditioned on the robot's future actions amounts to learning a "visual imagination" of different futures based on different courses of action. Our experiments show that our proposed method produces more accurate video predictions both quantitatively and qualitatively, when compared to prior methods.},

  abstract = {The proven efficacy of learning-based control schemes strongly motivates their application to robotic systems operating in the physical world. However, guaranteeing correct operation during the learning process is currently an unresolved issue, which is of vital importance in safety-critical systems. We propose a general safety framework based on Hamilton-Jacobi reachability methods that can work in conjunction with an arbitrary learning algorithm. The method exploits approximate knowledge of the system dynamics to guarantee constraint satisfaction while minimally interfering with the learning process. We further introduce a Bayesian mechanism that refines the safety analysis as the system acquires new evidence, reducing initial conservativeness when appropriate while strengthening guarantees through real-time validation. The result is a least-restrictive, safety-preserving control law that intervenes only when (a) the computed safety guarantees require it, or (b) confidence in the computed guarantees decays in light of new observations. We prove theoretical safety guarantees combining probabilistic and worst-case analysis and demonstrate the proposed framework experimentally on a quadrotor vehicle. Even though safety analysis is based on a simple point-mass model, the quadrotor successfully arrives at a suitable controller by policygradient reinforcement learning without ever crashing, and safely retracts away from a strong external disturbance introduced during flight.},

Thus, assuming that the parameters related to the kinematics are perfectly known, these quantities can be estimated through linear regression techniques. The necessary data are obtained by measuring the joint forces and/or torques and the resulting motion given in terms of positions, velocities and accelerations. An alternative method uses measurements of the reaction forces and torques applied to the bedplate. The linearity of the dynamic and reaction models with respect to the barycentric quantities does not however imply that the latter constitute the minimum set of parameters characterizing the mass distribution of the system. In other words, some barycentric parameters may disappear from the models or may be redundant in the sense that they appear only via linear combinations. In the first case they are not identifiable, while in the second case the linear regression technique leads to estimated values which are correct for the combinations but can be erroneous for the individual parameters. The various options taken to derive the dynamic and reaction models by use of the ROBOTRAN programme are briefly reviewed. Then the rules leading to the minimal parametrization are presented and illustrated by means of a practical example related to a robot calibration problem.},

We instead propose an approach using self-supervised dense visual correspondence training, and show this enables visuomotor policy learning with surprisingly high generalization performance with modest amounts of data: using imitation learning, we demonstrate extensive hardware validation on challenging manipulation tasks with as few as 50 demonstrations. Our learned policies can generalize across classes of objects, react to deformable object configurations, and manipulate textureless symmetrical objects in a variety of backgrounds, all with closedloop, real-time vision-based policies. Simulated imitation learning experiments suggest that correspondence training offers sample complexity and generalization benefits compared to autoencoding and end-to-end training.},

  abstract = {Impedance control is a well-established technique to control interaction forces in robotics. However, real implementations of impedance control with an inner loop may suffer from several limitations. Although common practice in designing nested control systems is to maximize the bandwidth of the inner loop to improve tracking performance, it may not be the most suitable approach when a certain range of impedance parameters has to be rendered. In particular, it turns out that the viable range of stable stiffness and damping values can be strongly affected by the bandwidth of the inner control loops (e.g. a torque loop) as well as by the filtering and sampling frequency. This paper provides an extensive analysis on how these aspects influence the stability region of impedance parameters as well as the passivity of the system. This will be supported by both simulations and experimental data. Moreover, a methodology for designing joint impedance controllers based on an inner torque loop and a positive velocity feedback loop will be presented. The goal of the velocity feedback is to increase (given the constraints to preserve stability) the bandwidth of the torque loop without the need of a complex controller.},

Such FF SPR/BR controllers will be used to control systems that have experienced a passivity violation. We first review the hybrid passive/finite-gain systems framework and how linear time-invariant hybrid passive/finite-gain systems relate to systems with low-frequency FF positive real (PR) or SPR properties, and high-frequency FF BR properties as characterized by the GKYP lemma. Optimal design of FF SPR/BR controllers is considered next. A convex optimization problem constrained by a set of linear matrix inequalities is posed where constraints are imposed using various forms of the GKYP lemma, yielding optimal FF SPR/BR controllers. The FF SPR/BR controllers are optimal in that they approximate the traditional H2 control solution. Finally, FF SPR/BR controllers are used within a gain-scheduling architecture to control a two-link flexible manipulator. Experimental results successfully demonstrate closed-loop stability and good closed-loop performance.},

In this paper a possible guideline to design a system capable to localize itself, identify a target, bulky, object and manipulate it, is presented. A method for tuning the impedance control parameters is shown, to keep interaction forces below dangerous values. The autonomous localization, grasping and assembly of a sidewall panel of an airplane is used as test.

Parts manufactured through plastic deformation processes exhibit appreciable shape deviations from the nominal geometry due mainly to spring-back phenomena. When these parts are assembled, initial shape deviations at part level highly influence the final assembly shape. This work focuses on the modeling and simulation of shape errors in order to perform variation analysis of compliant assemblies. The aim is to simulate variational shape of parts according to a small number of control points chosen on the part geometry through a morphing mesh procedure. These points are typically related to measurement or inspection points of manufactured parts. From the mesh model of parts, mesh nodes are moved by applying the morphing procedure. In particular, in order to assure control points belong to the “perturbed” shape, a linear-constrained approach is adopted. The so-morphed parts are used to accomplish the variational assembly analysis following the classical place, clamp, fasten, and release cycle. In order to achieve statistical results, Monte Carlo simulation is performed: a set of control points driving the perturbed parts is generated at each iteration; these parts are then assembled and results are stored. Numerical results are compared with ones coming from commercial software that uses a linear approach based on the sensitivity matrix.},

Subjects learned to move in a null force field (NF), which was unexpectedly changed either to a velocity-dependent force field (VF), which resulted in perturbed but stable hand trajectories, or a position-dependent divergent force field (DF), which resulted in unstable trajectories. With practice, subjects learned to compensate for the perturbations produced by both force fields. Adaptation was characterized by an initial increase in the activation of all muscles followed by a gradual reduction. The time course of the increase in activation was correlated with a reduction in hand-path error for the DF but not for the VF. Adaptation to the VF could have been achieved solely by formation of an inverse dynamics model and adaptation to the DF solely by impedance control. However, indices of learning, such as hand-path error, joint torque, and electromyographic activation and deactivation suggest that the CNS combined these processes during adaptation to both force fields. Our results suggest that during the early phase of learning there is an increase in endpoint stiffness that serves to reduce hand-path error and provides additional stability, regardless of whether the dynamics are stable or unstable. We suggest that the motor control system utilizes an inverse dynamics model to learn the mean dynamics and an impedance controller to assist in the formation of the inverse dynamics model and to generate needed stability.},

  abstract = {Much of model-based reinforcement learning involves learning a model of an agent's world, and training an agent to leverage this model to perform a task more efficiently. While these models are demonstrably useful for agents, every naturally occurring model of the world of which we are aware---e.g., a brain---arose as the byproduct of competing evolutionary pressures for survival, not minimization of a supervised forward-predictive loss via gradient descent. That useful models can arise out of the messy and slow optimization process of evolution suggests that forward-predictive modeling can arise as a side-effect of optimization under the right circumstances. Crucially, this optimization process need not explicitly be a forward-predictive loss. In this work, we introduce a modification to traditional reinforcement learning which we call observational dropout, whereby we limit the agents ability to observe the real environment at each timestep. In doing so, we can coerce an agent into learning a world model to fill in the observation gaps during reinforcement learning. We show that the emerged world model, while not explicitly trained to predict the future, can help the agent learn key skills required to perform well in its environment.

  abstract = {One of the most difficult challenges in robot motion planning is to account for the behavior of other moving agents, such as humans. Commonly, practitioners employ predictive models to reason about where other agents are going to move. Though there has been much recent work in building predictive models, no model is ever perfect: an agent can always move unexpectedly, in a way that is not predicted or not assigned sufficient probability. In such cases, the robot may plan trajectories that appear safe but, in fact, lead to collision. Rather than trust a model?s predictions blindly, we propose that the robot should use the model?s current predictive accuracy to inform the degree of confidence in its future predictions. This model confidence inference allows us to generate probabilistic motion predictions that exploit modeled structure when the structure successfully explains human motion, and degrade gracefully whenever the human moves unexpectedly. We accomplish this by maintaining a Bayesian belief over a single parameter that governs the variance of our human motion model. We couple this prediction algorithm with a recently proposed robust motion planner and controller to guide the construction of robot trajectories that are, to a good approximation, collision-free with a high, user-specified probability. We provide extensive analysis of the combined approach and its overall safety properties by establishing a connection to reachability analysis, and conclude with a hardware demonstration in which a small quadcopter operates safely in the same space as a human pedestrian.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning has become more and more popular in robotics for acquiring feedback controllers. Many approaches aim for learning a controller from scratch, i.e., data-driven without any modeling of the physical plant. However, stability properties of the closed loop are often not considered, or established only a-posteriori or ad hoc. We propose to employ reinforcement learning in the context of model-based control, allowing to learn in a framework of stabilizing controllers built by using only little prior model knowledge. This way, the action space is suitably structured for safe learning of a feedback controller to compensate for uncertainties due to model mismatch or external disturbances. The resulting scheme is developed around a decentralized PD feedback controller. Therefore, given such a controller, by the proposed method one can also add a learning module for performance enhancement. We demonstrate our approach both in simulation and in a hardware experiment using a two degree of freedom robot manipulator.},

Two different training tasks in Virtual Reality were devised, that make use of the above control, and allow to make a performance based evaluation of patient's motor status. The PERCRO L-Exos (Light-Exoskeleton) was used to evaluate the proposed algorithms and training exercises in two clinical case studies of patients with chronic stroke, that performed 6 weeks of robotic assisted training. Clinical evaluation (Fugl-Meyer Scale, Modified Ashworth Scale, Bimanual Activity Test) was conducted before and after treatment and compared to the scores and the quantitative indices, such as task time, position/joint error and resistance torques, associated to the training exercises.},

Deep reinforcement learning methods can remove the need for explicit engineering of policy or value features, but still require a manually specified reward function. Inverse reinforcement learning holds the promise of automatic reward acquisition, but has proven exceptionally difficult to apply to large, high-dimensional problems with unknown dynamics. In this work, we propose adverserial inverse reinforcement learning (AIRL), a practical and scalable inverse reinforcement learning algorithm based on an adversarial reward learning formulation. We demonstrate that AIRL is able to recover reward functions that are robust to changes in dynamics, enabling us to learn policies even under significant variation in the environment seen during training. Our experiments show that AIRL greatly outperforms prior methods in these transfer settings.},

Morphological control is the application of morphological computing to a control task. In its theoretical part, this article sharpens and extends these definitions by suggesting new formalized definitions and identifying areas in which the definitions we propose are still inadequate. We go on to describe three ongoing studies, in which we are applying morphological control to problems in medicine and in chemistry. The first involves an inflatable support system for patients with impaired movement, and is based on macroscopic physics and concepts already tested in robotics. The two other case studies (self-assembly of chemical microreactors; models of induced cell repair in radio-oncology) describe processes and devices on the micrometer scale, in which the emergent dynamics of the underlying physical system (e.g., phase transitions) are dominated by stochastic processes such as diffusion.},

  abstract = {In this paper we describe a Bayesian approach to model selection and state estimation for sensor-based robot tasks. The approach is illustrated with a hybrid model–state estimation example from forcecontrolled autonomous compliant motion: simultaneous (discrete) contact formation recognition and estimation of (continuous) geometrical parameters. Previous research in this area mostly tries to solve one of the two subproblems, or treats the contact formation recognition problem separately, avoiding integration between the solutions to the contact formation recognition and the geometrical parameter estimation problems. A more powerful hybrid model, explicitly modeling contact formation transitions, is developed to deal with larger uncertainties. This paper demonstrates that Kalman filter variants have limits: iterated extended Kalman filters can only handle small uncertainties on the geometrical parameters, while the non-minimal state Kalman filter cannot deal with model selection. Particle filters can handle the increased level of model complexity. Explicit measurement equations for the particle filter are derived from the implicit kinematic and energetic constraints. The experiments prove that the particle filter approach successfully estimates the hybrid joint posterior density of the discrete contact formation variable and the 12-dimensional, continuous geometrical parameter vector during the execution of an assembly task. The problem shows similarities with the well-known problems of data association in simultaneous localization and map-building (SLAM) and model selection in global localization.},

Despite its utility, Hamilton's principle has a subtle pitfall that often goes unnoticed in physics: it is formulated as a boundary value problem in time but is used to derive equations of motion that are solved with initial data. This subtlety can have undesirable effects. I present a formulation of Hamilton's principle that is compatible with initial value problems. Remarkably, this leads to a natural formulation for the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian dynamics of generic non-conservative systems, thereby filling a long-standing gap in classical mechanics. Thus dissipative effects, for example, can be studied with new tools that may have application in a variety of disciplines. The new formalism is demonstrated by two examples of non-conservative systems: an object moving in a fluid with viscous drag forces and a harmonic oscillator coupled to a dissipative environment.},

The calculation is based on numerical QR and SVD factorizations and on the scaling procedure of matrices. It proceeds in three steps: * eliminate standard inertial parameters which have no effect on the dynamic model, * determine the number of base parameters, and * determine a set of base parameters by regrouping some standard parameters to some others in linear relations. Different models, linear in the inertial parameters are used: a complete dynamic model, a simplified dynamic model, and an energy model. The method is general, it can be applied to open loop, or graph-structured robots. The algorithms are easy to implement. An application for the PUMA 560 robot is given.},

We define the risk with respect to a policy as the probability of entering such a state when the policy is pursued. We consider the problem of finding good policies whose risk is smaller than some user-specified threshold, and formalize it as a constrained MDP with two criteria. The first criterion corresponds to the value function originally given. We will show that the risk can be formulated as a second criterion function based on a cumulative return, whose definition is independent of the original value function. We present a model free, heuristic reinforcement learning algorithm that aims at finding good deterministic policies. It is based on weighting the original value function and the risk. The weight parameter is adapted in order to find a feasible solution for the constrained problem that has a good performance with respect to the value function. The algorithm was successfully applied to the control of a feed tank with stochastic inflows that lies upstream of a distillation column. This control task was originally formulated as an optimal control problem with chance constraints, and it was solved under certain assumptions on the model to obtain an optimal solution. The power of our learning algorithm is that it can be used even when some of these restrictive assumptions are relaxed.},

In this paper, an end-user approach to collision detection and reaction is presented for an industrial manipulator having a closed control architecture and no additional sensors. The proposed detection and reaction schemes have minimal requirements: only the outer joint velocity reference to the robot manufacturer's controller is used, together with the available measurements of motor currents and joint positions. No a priori information on the robot dynamic model and existing low-level joint controllers is strictly needed. A suitable on-line processing of the motor currents allows to distinguish between accidental collisions and intended human-robot contacts, so as to switch the robot to a collaboration mode when needed. Two examples of reaction schemes for collaboration are presented, with the user pushing/pulling the robot at any point of its structure (e.g., for manual guidance) or with a compliant-like robot behavior in response to forces applied by the human. The actual performance of the methods is illustrated through experiments on a KUKA KR5 manipulator.},

  abstract = {Representation learning is a central challenge across a range of machine learning areas. In reinforcement learning, effective and functional representations have the potential to tremendously accelerate learning progress and solve more challenging problems. Most prior work on representation learning has focused on generative approaches, learning representations that capture all underlying factors of variation in the observation space in a more disentangled or well-ordered manner. In this paper, we instead aim to learn functionally salient representations: representations that are not necessarily complete in terms of capturing all factors of variation in the observation space, but rather aim to capture those factors of variation that are important for decision making -- that are "actionable." These representations are aware of the dynamics of the environment, and capture only the elements of the observation that are necessary for decision making rather than all factors of variation, without explicit reconstruction of the observation. We show how these representations can be useful to improve exploration for sparse reward problems, to enable long horizon hierarchical reinforcement learning, and as a state representation for learning policies for downstream tasks. We evaluate our method on a number of simulated environments, and compare it to prior methods for representation learning, exploration, and hierarchical reinforcement learning.},

An impedance controller, in combination with the attractive regions, is integrated in a novel controller whereby human-like assembly performance is achieved without using a force sensor. In this paper, the insertion task uses three different pegs, as shown in Fig. 1. The strategy is to decompose the 6 DOF space in which the peg moves into two low-dimensional subspaces. The controller uses stereo-triangulation and a k nearest-neighbor (k-NN) algorithm to identify the parts. An impedance controller monitors the forces (estimated by motor current rather than a force transducer) applied to the system and uses events rather than time to determine the state and the evolution of the assembly process. The approach is experimentally verified using a Barrett Technology’s WAM Arm, a backdrivable 7 DOF robotic manipulator.},

In this paper, we introduce the concept of adaptive submodularity, generalizing submodular set functions to adaptive policies. We prove that if a problem satisfies this property, a simple adaptive greedy algorithm is guaranteed to be competitive with the optimal policy. In addition to providing performance guarantees for both stochastic maximization and coverage, adaptive submodularity can be exploited to drastically speed up the greedy algorithm by using lazy evaluations. We illustrate the usefulness of the concept by giving several examples of adaptive submodular objectives arising in diverse applications including sensor placement, viral marketing and active learning. Proving adaptive submodularity for these problems allows us to recover existing results in these applications as special cases, improve approximation guarantees and handle natural generalizations.},

  abstract = {Assistive shared-control robots have the potential to transform the lives of millions of people afflicted with severe motor impairments. The usefulness of shared-control robots typically relies on the underlying autonomy's ability to infer the user's needs and intentions, and the ability to do so unambiguously is often a limiting factor for providing appropriate assistance confidently and accurately. The contributions of this paper are four-fold. First, we introduce the idea of intent disambiguation via control mode selection, and present a mathematical formalism for the same. Second, we develop a control mode selection algorithm which selects the control mode in which the user-initiated motion helps the autonomy to maximally disambiguate user intent. Third, we present a pilot study with eight subjects to evaluate the efficacy of the disambiguation algorithm. Our results suggest that the disambiguation system (a) helps to significantly reduce task effort, as measured by number of button presses, and (b) is of greater utility for more limited control interfaces and more complex tasks. We also observe that (c) subjects demonstrated a wide range of disambiguation request behaviors, with the common thread of concentrating requests early in the execution. As our last contribution, we introduce a novel field-theoretic approach to intent inference inspired by dynamic field theory that works in tandem with the disambiguation scheme.},

First, a literature review is provided that introduces the main contributions in this area. Then, a static analysis is briefly described, and a model that can be used for analysis and synthesis of linkage-based underactuated fingers is developed. Two examples of underactuated fingers with, respectively, two and three phalanges are then introduced in order to demonstrate the application of the model and to raise the main design issues. Examples of underactuated hands based on these underactuated fingers are then described, and some existing prototypes are presented.},

  abstract = {Transferring solutions found by trajectory optimization to robotic hardware remains a challenging task. When the optimization fully exploits the provided model to perform dynamic tasks, the presence of unmodeled dynamics renders the motion infeasible on the real system. Model errors can be a result of model simplifications, but also naturally arise when deploying the robot in unstructured and nondeterministic environments. Predominantly, compliant contacts and actuator dynamics lead to bandwidth limitations. While classical control methods provide tools to synthesize controllers that are robust to a class of model errors, such a notion is missing in modern trajectory optimization, which is solved in the time domain. We propose frequency-shaped cost functions to achieve robust solutions in the context of optimal control for legged robots. Through simulation and hardware experiments we show that motion plans can be made compatible with bandwidth limits set by actuators and contact dynamics. The smoothness of the model predictive solutions can be continuously tuned without compromising the feasibility of the problem. Experiments with the quadrupedal robot ANYmal, which is driven by highly-compliant series elastic actuators, showed significantly improved tracking performance of the planned motion, torque, and force trajectories and enabled the machine to walk robustly on terrain with unmodeled compliance.},

  abstract = {Information processing in the nervous system during sensorimotor tasks with inherent uncertainty has been shown to be consistent with Bayesian integration. Bayes optimal decision-makers are, however, risk-neutral in the sense that they weigh all possibilities based on prior expectation and sensory evidence when they choose the action with highest expected value. In contrast, risk-sensitive decision-makers are sensitive to model uncertainty and bias their decision-making processes when they do inference over unobserved variables. In particular, they allow deviations from their probabilistic model in cases where this model makes imprecise predictions. Here we test for risk-sensitivity in a sensorimotor integration task where subjects exhibit Bayesian information integration when they infer the position of a target from noisy sensory feedback. When introducing a cost associated with subjects' response, we found that subjects exhibited a characteristic bias towards low cost responses when their uncertainty was high. This result is in accordance with risk-sensitive decision-making processes that allow for deviations from Bayes optimal decision-making in the face of uncertainty. Our results suggest that both Bayesian integration and risk-sensitivity are important factors to understand sensorimotor integration in a quantitative fashion.},

  abstract = {In active sensing, sensing actions are typically chosen to minimize the uncertainty of the state according to some information-theoretic measure such as entropy, conditional entropy, mutual information, etc. This is reasonable for applications where the goal is to obtain information. However, when the information about the state is used to perform a task, minimizing state uncertainty may not lead to sensing actions that provide the information that is most useful to the task. This is because the uncertainty in some subspace of the state space could have more impact on the performance of the task than others, and this dependence can vary at different stages of the task. One way to combine task, uncertainty, and sensing, is to model the problem as a sequential decision making problem under uncertainty. Unfortunately, the solutions to these problems are computationally expensive. This paper presents a new task-oriented active sensing scheme, where the task is taken into account in sensing action selection by choosing sensing actions that minimize the uncertainty in future task-related actions instead of state uncertainty. The proposed method is validated via simulations.},

However, some assembly tasks permit contact through compliance, and such contact may allow for more efficient and reliable solutions under action uncertainty. But, optimal manipulation plans that leverage environmental contact are difficult to compute. Environmental contact produces complex kinematics that create difficulties for planning. This complexity is usually addressed by discretization over state and action space, but discretization quickly becomes computationally intractable. To overcome the challenge, we use the insight that only actions on configurations near the contact manifold are likely to involve complex kinematics, while segments of the plan through free space do not. Leveraging this structure can greatly reduce the number of states considered and scales much better with problem complexity. We develop an algorithm based on this idea and show that it performs comparably to full MDP solutions at a fraction of the computational cost.},

Unfortunately, planning optimally in the face of uncertainty is notoriously taxing, since the search space is enormous. In this paper we introduce a tractable, sample-based method for approximate Bayes-optimal planning which exploits Monte-Carlo tree search. Our approach avoids expensive applications of Bayes rule within the search tree by sampling models from current beliefs, and furthermore performs this sampling in a lazy manner. This enables it to outperform previous Bayesian model-based reinforcement learning algorithms by a significant margin on several well-known benchmark problems. As we show, our approach can even work in problems with an infinite state space that lie qualitatively out of reach of almost all previous work in Bayesian exploration.},

This characterization corresponds to gain bounded systems, or bounded real systems, for β = 1, and it corresponds to phase bounded, positive real systems for β = 0. State space characterization of β-bounded LTI systems is presented in terms of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs), similar to the LMIs for bounded realness and positive realness. Robust stability results are developed in this paper for β-bounded systems, including stability of the feedback interconnection of β-bounded LTI systems and stability of uncertain systems with β-bounded uncertainties. Small gain and passivity conditions for robust stability are seen as special cases of these results for β-bounded systems. Finally, a convex optimization procedure is presented to select parameters for a tight characterization of uncertain LTI systems in terms of β-boundedness, and the technique is illustrated with a spring-mass-damper example.},

The contribution of this paper is the extension of this positive real synthesis technique to include an H∞-norm constraint on closed-loop performance},

These properties qualify them for applications requiring high mobility and direct interaction with human users or uncertain environments. An essential requirement for such a robot is that it must under no circumstances pose a threat to the human operator. To actually quantify the potential injury risk emanating from the manipulator, impact test were carried out using standard automobile crash-test facilities at the ADAC1. In our evaluation we focused on unexpected rigid frontal impacts, i.e. injuries e.g. caused by sharp edges are excluded. Several injury mechanisms and so called Severity Indices are evaluated and discussed with respect to their adaptability to physical human-robotic interaction.},

An essential requirement of a robot designed for high mobility and direct interaction with human users or uncertain environments is that it must in no case pose a threat to the human. Until recently, quite a few attempts were made to investigate real-world threats via collision tests and use the outcome to considerably improve safety during physical human–robot interaction. In this paper, we give an overview of our systematic evaluation of safety in human–robot interaction, covering various aspects of the most significant injury mechanisms. In order to quantify the potential injury risk emanating from such a manipulator, impact tests with the DLR-Lightweight Robot III were carried out using standard automobile crash test facilities at the German Automobile Club (ADAC).

  abstract = {Robot assistants and professional coworkers are becoming a commodity in domestic and industrial settings. In order to enable robots to share their workspace with humans and physically interact with them, fast and reliable handling of possible collisions on the entire robot structure is needed, along with control strategies for safe robot reaction. The primary motivation is the prevention or limitation of possible human injury due to physical contacts. In this survey paper, based on our early work on the subject, we review, extend, compare, and evaluate experimentally model-based algorithms for real-time collision detection, isolation, and identification that use only proprioceptive sensors. This covers the context-independent phases of the collision event pipeline for robots interacting with the environment, as in physical human-robot interaction or manipulation tasks. The problem is addressed for rigid robots first and then extended to the presence of joint/transmission flexibility. The basic physically motivated solution has already been applied to numerous robotic systems worldwide, ranging from manipulators and humanoids to flying robots, and even to commercial products.},

We propose the Deep Planning Network (PlaNet), a purely model-based agent that learns the environment dynamics from images and chooses actions through fast online planning in latent space. To achieve high performance, the dynamics model must accurately predict the rewards ahead for multiple time steps. We approach this using a latent dynamics model with both deterministic and stochastic transition components.

Using only pixel observations, our agent solves continuous control tasks with contact dynamics, partial observability, and sparse rewards, which exceed the difficulty of tasks that were previously solved by planning with learned models.

  abstract = {Suppose k-variate data are drawn from a mixture of two distributions, each having independent components. It is desired to estimate the univariate marginal distributions in each of the products, as well as the mixing proportion. This is the setting of two-class, fully parametrized latent models that has been proposed for estimating the distributions of medical test results when disease status is unavailable. The problem is one of inference in a mixture of distributions without training data, and until now it has been tackled only in a fully parametric setting. We investigate the possibility of using nonparametric methods. Of course, when k = 1 the problem is not identifiable from a nonparametric viewpoint. We show that the problem is "almost" identifiable when k = 2; there, the set of all possible representations can be expressed, in terms of any one of those representations, as a two-parameter family. Furthermore, it is proved that when k ≥ 3 the problem is nonparametrically identifiable under particularly mild regularity conditions. In this case we introduce root-n consistent nonparametric estimators of the 2k univariate marginal distributions and the mixing proportion. Finite-sample and asymptotic properties of the estimators are described.}

Further this knowledge need to be quickly accessed and utilized through the process of introducing a robot for a task, updating existing systems to more efficient ones, and implementing similar tasks. This paper proposes a framework to store data related to tasks and enable task implementation using search, customization and combination of the stored data. The stored data include motion patterns of robots, various meta-data including texts, images, 3D models and other documents. They are managed based on task models. The meta-data are used by humans to figure out the tasks and reusability of the associated motion patterns. The primary goal of this framework is to assist the process of thinking and implementation by humans. This paper presents an analysis of typical use-cases and system design of the framework, and implementation on Choreonoid. Then an experiment is presented, where a sequence of assembling a complex mechanical unit is described using the proposed framework. We also discuss issues on the current framework specifications and possible cooperation with automation technologies and external data sources.},

However, the more complex dynamics of compliant actuators requires proper model selection and controller design to give satisfactory performance. Here, a series-elastic actuator integrated to an upper-limb exoskeleton is considered. To consider the effects of the elastic element, a model for the series elastic actuator with load-side dynamics is introduced, validated, then used for controller design.

This design comprises two parallelogram flexure modules in a nested parallel arrangement and is termed the parallel double parallelogram flexure mechanism (or parallel-DPFM). Compared to the previously known parallel-DPFM, the proposed mechanism is more compact while offering several desirable performance characteristics including motion direction stiffness that is independent of bearing direction load, robustness against buckling, and suppression of error motion in the bearing direction. Closed-form planar force-displacement relations for the new design with a general beam shape have been derived to confirm these performance characteristics and provide design insights via parametric analysis. Nonlinear finite element analysis (FEA) and experimental testing are carried out to validate the analytically predicted performance characteristics for a specific beam shape that corresponds to the uniformly distributed-compliance case.},

These spaces do not possess expansiveness, a property that characterizes whether planning queries can be solved with traditional sample-based planners. We present a new sample-based multi-modal planning algorithm and analyze its completeness properties. In particular, it converges quickly when each mode is expansive relative to the submanifold in which it is embedded. We also present a variant that has the same convergence properties, but works better for problems with a large number of modes. These algorithms are demonstrated in a legged locomotion planner.},

The method is further extended to choose the most informative action to simultaneously localize and estimate the object's model parameter or model class.

However, it is still unclear what constitutes favorable natural dynamics and how to quantify its effect. Most studies of simple walking and running models have focused on the basins of attraction of passive limit-cycles and the notion of self-stability. We instead emphasize the importance of stepping beyond basins of attraction. We show an approach based on viability theory to quantify robust sets in state-action space. These sets are valid for the family of all robust control policies, which allows us to quantify the robustness inherent to the natural dynamics before designing the control policy or specifying a control objective. We illustrate our formulation using spring-mass models, simple low dimensional models of running systems. We then show an example application by optimizing robustness of a simulated planar monoped, using a gradient-free optimization scheme. Both case studies result in a nonlinear effective stiffness providing more robustness.},

  abstract = {Lagrangian systems represent a wide range of robotic systems, including manipulators, wheeled and legged robots, and quadrotors. Inverse dynamics control and feedforward linearization techniques are typically used to convert the complex nonlinear dynamics of Lagrangian systems to a set of decoupled double integrators, and then a standard, outer-loop controller can be used to calculate the commanded acceleration for the linearized system. However, these methods typically depend on having a very accurate system model, which is often not available in practice. While this challenge has been addressed in the literature using different learning approaches, most of these approaches do not provide safety guarantees in terms of stability of the learning-based control system. In this paper, we provide a novel, learning-based control approach based on Gaussian processes (GPs) that ensures both stability of the closed-loop system and high-accuracy tracking. We use GPs to approximate the error between the commanded acceleration and the actual acceleration of the system, and then use the predicted mean and variance of the GP to calculate an upper bound on the uncertainty of the linearized model. This uncertainty bound is then used in a robust, outer-loop controller to ensure stability of the overall system. Moreover, we show that the tracking error converges to a ball with a radius that can be made arbitrarily small. Furthermore, we verify the effectiveness of our approach via simulations on a 2 degree-of-freedom (DOF) planar manipulator and experimentally on a 6 DOF industrial manipulator.},

In this study, we propose a collision detection framework (CollisionNet) based on a deep learning approach. We designed a deep neural network model to learn robot collision signals and recognize any occurrence of a collision. This data-driven approach unifies feature extraction from high-dimensional signals and the decision processes. CollisionNet eliminates heuristic and cumbersome nature of the traditional decision processes, showing high detection performance and generalization capability in real time.

  abstract = {Fast and safe navigation of dynamical systems through a priori unknown cluttered environments is vital to many applications of autonomous systems. However, trajectory planning for autonomous systems is computationally intensive, often requiring simplified dynamics that sacrifice safety and dynamic feasibility in order to plan efficiently. Conversely, safe trajectories can be computed using more sophisticated dynamic models, but this is typically too slow to be used for real-time planning. We propose a new algorithm FaSTrack: Fast and Safe Tracking for High Dimensional systems. A path or trajectory planner using simplified dynamics to plan quickly can be incorporated into the FaSTrack framework, which provides a safety controller for the vehicle along with a guaranteed tracking error bound. This bound captures all possible deviations due to high dimensional dynamics and external disturbances. Note that FaSTrack is modular and can be used with most current path or trajectory planners. We demonstrate this framework using a 10D nonlinear quadrotor model tracking a 3D path obtained from an RRT planner.},

They completed 23 trials at each speed. With the hand constrained to move in a circle, non-zero forces against the constraint were measured. Assuming a plausible mathematical model of interactive dynamics, the peripheral neuromechanics could be `subtracted', revealing an underlying motion that reflected neural control. We called this data-driven construct the zeroforce trajectory. The observed zero-force trajectory was approximately elliptical. Its major axis, estimated by the principal eigenvector of the covariance matrix, differed significantly for the two movement directions. As peripheral neuromuscular compliance (i.e. low mechanical impedance) mitigates the consequences of imperfect execution, the required precision of motion commands is reduced. An oscillatory zeroforce trajectory that leads hand motion suffices to produce circular hand motions. Due to non-isotropic peripheral dynamics, that lead differs between degrees of freedom, resulting in an elliptical zero-force trajectory. The ellipses' orientations differ with direction of rotation, as observed in the experimental data. As elliptical motion is generated by two non-colinear sinusoids with non-zero phase difference, these results support the hypothesis that humans simplify this constrained-motion task by exploiting primitive dynamic actions, oscmations and impedance.},

  abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved several high profile successes in difficult decision-making problems. However, these algorithms typically require a huge amount of data before they reach reasonable performance. In fact, their performance during learning can be extremely poor. This may be acceptable for a simulator, but it severely limits the applicability of deep RL to many real-world tasks, where the agent must learn in the real environment. In this paper we study a setting where the agent may access data from previous control of the system. We present an algorithm, Deep Q-learning from Demonstrations (DQfD), that leverages small sets of demonstration data to massively accelerate the learning process even from relatively small amounts of demonstration data and is able to automatically assess the necessary ratio of demonstration data while learning thanks to a prioritized replay mechanism. DQfD works by combining temporal difference updates with supervised classification of the demonstrator's actions. We show that DQfD has better initial performance than Prioritized Dueling Double Deep Q-Networks (PDD DQN) as it starts with better scores on the first million steps on 41 of 42 games and on average it takes PDD DQN 83 million steps to catch up to DQfD's performance. DQfD learns to out-perform the best demonstration given in 14 of 42 games. In addition, DQfD leverages human demonstrations to achieve state-of-the-art results for 11 games. Finally, we show that DQfD performs better than three related algorithms for incorporating demonstration data into DQN.},

Importantly, we show that structure matters: incorporating knowledge about locality of the input to the objective can greatly influence a representation's suitability for downstream tasks. We further control characteristics of the representation by matching to a prior distribution adversarially. Our method, which we call Deep InfoMax (DIM), outperforms a number of popular unsupervised learning methods and competes with fully-supervised learning on several classification tasks. DIM opens new avenues for unsupervised learning of representations and is an important step towards flexible formulations of representation-learning objectives for specific end-goals.},

A feedback control algorithm for imposing a desired cartesian impedance on the end-point of a nonlinear manipulator is presented. This algorithm completely eliminates the need to solve the “inverse kinematics problem” in robot motion control. The modulation of end-point impedance without using feedback control is also considered, and it is shown that apparently “redundant” actuators and degrees of freedom such as exist in the primate musculoskeletal system may be used to modulate end-point impedance and may play an essential functional role in the control of dynamic interaction.},

One of the difficulties engendered by contact tasks is that they require intimate dynamic interaction between the robot and its environment. That interaction changes the performance of the robot and can jeopardize the stability of its control system. A discussion is presented of the problem of preserving the stability of a manipulator's control system during contact tasks. It will be shown that contact stability may be guaranteed if the control system provides the manipulator with an appropriately structured dynamic response to environmental inputs. Two aspects of one implementation of such a controller will be considered. Robustness to large errors in the manipulator kinematic equations and to unmodeled interface dynamics is shown.{$<>$}},

This approach – Freedom and Constraint Topology (FACT) – is unique in that it is based upon sets of geometric entities that contain quantitative information about a flexure system’s characteristics. A first set contains information about a flexure system’s degrees of freedom (its freedom topology) and a second set contains information about the flexure system’s topology (its constraint topology). These sets may be used to visualize the quantitative relationships between all possible flexure designs and all possible motions for a given design problem. We introduce a new principle – complementary topologies – that enables the unique mapping of freedom and constraint spaces. This mapping makes it possible to visualize and determine the general shape(s) that a viable parallel flexure system concept must have in order to permit specified motions. The shapes contain all of the relevant quantitative information that is needed to rapidly sketch early embodiments of complex parallel flexure system concepts. These shapes may then be used to rapidly synthesize a multiplicity of flexure system concepts that have (a) independent rotational and/or linear motions, (b) coupled linear and rotational motions, and (c) redundant constraints that permit the desired motions while improving stiffness, load capacity and thermal stability. This enables early-stage flexure system design via “paper and pencil sketches” without undue complications that arise when one focuses upon detailed mathematical treatments that are better-suited for optimization rather than visualization and synthesis.},

  abstract = {The information theory developed by Shannon was designed to place a quantitative measure on the amount of information involved in any communication. The early developers stressed that the information measure was dependent only on the probabilistic structure of the communication process. For example, if losing all your assets in the stock market and having whale steak for supper have the same probability, then the information associated with the occurrence of either event is the same. Attempts to apply Shannon's information theory to problems beyond communications have, in the large, come to grief. The failure of these attempts could have been predicted because no theory that involves just the probabilities of outcomes without considering their consequences could possibly be adequate in describing the importance of uncertainty to a decision maker. It is necessary to be concerned not only with the probabilistic nature of the uncertainties that surround us, but also with the economic impact that these uncertainties will have on us. In this paper the theory of the value of information that arises from considering jointly the probabilistic and economic factors that affect decisions is discussed and illustrated. It is found that numerical values can be assigned to the elimination or reduction of any uncertainty. Furthermore, it is seen that the joint elimination of the uncertainty about a number of even independent factors in a problem can have a value that differs from the sum of the values of eliminating the uncertainty in each factor separately.},

The experiments examine the GMMs algorithmic issues including the model order selection and variance limiting, the segmentation of the data, and various feature sets including time-domain features and autoregressive features. The benefits of postprocessing the results using a majority vote rule are demonstrated. The performance of the GMM is compared to three commonly used classifiers: a linear discriminant analysis, a linear perceptron network, and a multilayer perceptron neural network. The GMM-based limb motion classification system demonstrates exceptional classification accuracy and results in a robust method of motion classification with low computational load.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Soft robots are primarily composed of soft materials that can allow for mechanically robust maneuvers that are not typically possible with conventional rigid robotic systems. However, owing to the current limitations in simulation, design and control of soft robots often involve a painstaking trial. With the ultimate goal of a computational framework for soft robotic engineering, here we introduce a numerical simulation tool for limbed soft robots that draws inspiration from discrete differential geometry based simulation of slender structures. The simulation incorporates an implicit treatment of the elasticity of the limbs, inelastic collision between a soft body and rigid surface, and unilateral contact and Coulombic friction with an uneven surface. The computational efficiency of the numerical method enables it to run faster than real-time on a desktop processor. Our experiments and simulations show quantitative agreement and indicate the potential role of predictive simulations for soft robot design.},

  abstract = {Recursive prediction of the state of a nonlinear stochastic dynamic system cannot be efficiently performed in general, since the complexity of the probability density function characterizing the system state increases with every prediction step. Thus, representing the density in an exact closed-form manner is too complex or even impossible. So, an appropriate approximation of the density is required. Instead of directly approximating the predicted density, we propose the approximation of the transition density by means of Gaussian mixtures. We treat the approximation task as an optimization problem that is solved offline via progressive processing to bypass initialization problems and to achieve high quality approximations. Once having calculated the transition density approximation offline, prediction can be performed efficiently resulting in a closed-form density representation with constant complexity},

An intention-guided control strategy is proposed for the upper-limb power-assist exoskeleton. A force sensor system comprised of force sensing resistors (FSRs) is designed to online estimate the motion intention of user upper limb. A new concept called "intentional reaching direction (IRD)" is proposed to quantitatively describe this intention. Both the state model and the observation model of IRD are obtained by enumerating the upper limb behavior modes and analyzing the relationship between the measured force signals and the motion intention. Based on these two models, the IRD can be online inferred by applying filtering technology. Guided by the estimated IRD, an admittance control strategy is assumed to control the motions of three DC motors in the joints of the robotic arm. The effectiveness of the proposed approaches is finally confirmed by the experiments on a 3-DOF robotic exoskeleton.},

  abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for autonomously acquiring complex behaviors from low level sensor observations. Although a large portion of deep RL research has focused on applications in video games and simulated control, which does not connect with the constraints of learning in real environments, deep RL has also demonstrated promise in enabling physical robots to learn complex skills in the real world. At the same time,real world robotics provides an appealing domain for evaluating such algorithms, as it connects directly to how humans learn; as an embodied agent in the real world. Learning to perceive and move in the real world presents numerous challenges, some of which are easier to address than others, and some of which are often not considered in RL research that focuses only on simulated domains. In this review article, we present a number of case studies involving robotic deep RL. Building off of these case studies, we discuss commonly perceived challenges in deep RL and how they have been addressed in these works. We also provide an overview of other outstanding challenges, many of which are unique to the real-world robotics setting and are not often the focus of mainstream RL research. Our goal is to provide a resource both for roboticists and machine learning researchers who are interested in furthering the progress of deep RL in the real world.},

  abstract = {Dynamic game theory provides mathematical means for modeling the interaction between several players, where their decisions are explained by individual cost functions. The inverse problem of dynamic games, where cost functions are sought which explain observed behavior, has recently gained attention due to its potential application for identification of biological systems and the possibility of generalizing inverse optimal control results. In this paper, we extend maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning to the N-player case in order to solve inverse dynamic games with continuous-valued state and control spaces. On this basis, we first present a method for identification of cost function parameters in a cooperative game. Afterwards, we propose an approach for identifying cost function parameters which explain the behavior of the players in a non-cooperative setting, i.e. open-loop and feedback Nash equilibrium behaviors. Furthermore, we give results on the unbiasedness of the estimation of cost function parameters for each class of inverse dynamic game. The applicability of the methods is demonstrated with simulation examples of a nonlinear and a linear-quadratic dynamic game.},

Methods: We compare the behaviour and assessment of subjects tracking a moving target with assistance from (i) trajectory guidance (as typically used in robots for physical training), (ii) a human partner, and (iii) the reactive robot partner of Takagi et al. Results: Trajectory guidance was recognised as robotic, while the robot partner was felt as human-like. However, trajectory guidance was preferred to assistance from a human partner, which was recognised as less predictable. The robot partner also was felt to be more predictable and helpful than a human partner, and was preferred. Conclusions: While subjects like to rely on predictable interaction, such as in trajectory guidance, the control reactivity of the robot partner is essential for perceiving an interaction as human-like.},

  abstract = {Model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers an attractive approach to learn control policies for high-dimensional systems, but its relatively poor sample complexity often forces training in simulated environments. Even in simulation, goal-directed tasks whose natural reward function is sparse remain intractable for state-of-the-art model-free algorithms for continuous control. The bottleneck in these tasks is the prohibitive amount of exploration required to obtain a learning signal from the initial state of the system. In this work, we leverage physical priors in the form of an approximate system dynamics model to design a curriculum scheme for a model-free policy optimization algorithm. Our Backward Reachability Curriculum (BaRC) begins policy training from states that require a small number of actions to accomplish the task, and expands the initial state distribution backwards in a dynamically-consistent manner once the policy optimization algorithm demonstrates sufficient performance. BaRC is general, in that it can accelerate training of any model-free RL algorithm on a broad class of goal-directed continuous control MDPs. Its curriculum strategy is physically intuitive, easy-to-tune, and allows incorporating physical priors to accelerate training without hindering the performance, flexibility, and applicability of the model-free RL algorithm. We evaluate our approach on two representative dynamic robotic learning problems and find substantial performance improvement relative to previous curriculum generation techniques and naive exploration strategies.},

  abstract = {Many mechanical systems are large and complex, despite being composed of simple subsystems. In order to understand such large systems it is natural to tear the system into these subsystems. Conversely we must understand how to invert this tearing. In other words, we must understand interconnection. Such an understanding has already successfully understood in the context of Hamiltonian systems on vector spaces via the port-Hamiltonian systems program. In port-Hamiltonian systems theory, interconnection is achieved through the identification of shared variables, whereupon the notion of composition of Dirac structures allows one to interconnect two systems. In this paper we seek to extend the port-Hamiltonian systems program to Lagrangian systems on manifolds and extend the notion of composition of Dirac structures appropriately. In particular, we will interconnect Lagrange-Dirac systems by modifying the respective Dirac structures of the involved subsystems. We define the interconnection of Dirac structures via an interaction Dirac structure and a tensor product of Dirac structures. We will show how the dynamics of the interconnected system is formulated as a function of the subsystems, and we will elucidate the associated variational principles. We will then illustrate how this theory extends the theory of port-Hamiltonian systems and the notion of composition of Dirac structures to manifolds with couplings which do not require the identification of shared variables. Lastly, we will close with some examples: a mass-spring mechanical systems, an electric circuit, and a nonholonomic mechanical system.},

Peg-hole interaction is analytically modeled and based on it the force required to correct the lateral and angular errors by IPMC is calculated. A proportional-derivative (PD) controller is designed to actuate the IPMC to get the desired force for correcting the peg position before assembly. Simulations and experiments were carried out by developing an IPMC micro gripper and using it to analyze various cases of peg in hole assembly. The experimental results prove that adding compliance through IPMC helps in peg-in-hole assembly.},

  abstract = {Sudden changes in the dynamics of robotic tasks, such as contact with an object or the latching of a door, are often viewed as inconvenient discontinuities that make manipulation difficult. However, when these transitions are well-understood, they can be leveraged to reduce uncertainty or aid manipulation---for example, wiggling a screw to determine if it is fully inserted or not. Current model-free reinforcement learning approaches require large amounts of data to learn to leverage such dynamics, scale poorly as problem complexity grows, and do not transfer well to significantly different problems. By contrast, hierarchical planning-based methods scale well via plan decomposition and work well on a wide variety of problems, but often rely on precise hand-specified models and task decompositions. To combine the advantages of these opposing paradigms, we propose a new method, Act-CHAMP, which (1) learns hybrid kinematics models of objects from unsegmented data, (2) leverages actions, in addition to states, to outperform a state-of-the-art observation-only inference method, and (3) does so in a manner that is compatible with efficient, hierarchical POMDP planning. Beyond simply coping with challenging dynamics, we show that our end-to-end system leverages the learned kinematics to reduce uncertainty, plan efficiently, and use objects in novel ways not encountered during training.},

An interesting alternative solution is to learn such models from data, and keep them up-to-date through online adaptation. In this paper we consider the problem of learning the robot inverse dynamic model under dynamically varying contexts: the robot learns incrementally and autonomously the model under different conditions, represented by the manipulation of objects of different weights, that change the dynamics of the system. The inverse dynamic mapping is modeled as a multi-valued function, in which different outputs for the same input query are related to different dynamic contexts (i.e. different manipulated objects). The mapping is estimated using IMLE, a recent online learning algorithm for multi-valued regression, and used for Computed Torque control. No information is given about the context switch during either learning or control, nor any assumption is made about the kind of variation in the dynamics imposed by a new contexts. Experimental results with the iCub humanoid robot are provided.},

A principal challenge in improving behavior is in obtaining a transparent description of existing behavior in the first place. In this paper, we develop an expressive, unifying perspective on inverse decision modeling: a framework for learning parameterized representations of sequential decision behavior. First, we formalize the forward problem (as a normative standard), subsuming common classes of control behavior. Second, we use this to formalize the inverse problem (as a descriptive model), generalizing existing work on imitation/reward learning—while opening up a much broader class of research problems in behavior representation. Finally, we instantiate this approach with an example (inverse bounded rational control), illustrating how this structure enables learning (interpretable) representations of (bounded) rationality—while naturally capturing intuitive notions of suboptimal actions, biased beliefs, and imperfect knowledge of environments.},

In this work, we focus on the problem of efficiently constructing such a sequence by drawing an explicit connection to submodularity. Ideally, we would like a method that finds the optimal sequence, taking the minimum amount of time while providing sufficient information. Finding this sequence, however, is generally intractable. As a result, many well-established methods select actions greedily. Surprisingly, this often performs well. Our work first explains this high performance - we note a commonly used metric, reduction of Shannon entropy, is submodular under certain assumptions, rendering the greedy solution comparable to the optimal plan in the offline setting. However, reacting online to observations can increase performance. Recently developed notions of adaptive submodularity provide guarantees for a greedy algorithm in this online setting. In this work, we develop new methods based on adaptive submodularity for selecting a sequence of information gathering actions online. In addition to providing guarantees, we can capitalize on submodularity to attain additional computational speedups. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods in simulation and on a robot.},

  abstract = {In shared autonomy, user input and robot autonomy are combined to control a robot to achieve a goal. Often, the robot does not know a priori which goal the user wants to achieve, and must both predict the user's intended goal, and assist in achieving that goal. We formulate the problem of shared autonomy as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process with uncertainty over the user's goal. We utilize maximum entropy inverse optimal control to estimate a distribution over the user's goal based on the history of inputs. Ideally, the robot assists the user by solving for an action which minimizes the expected cost-to-go for the (unknown) goal. As solving the POMDP to select the optimal action is intractable, we use hindsight optimization to approximate the solution. In a user study, we compare our method to a standard predict-then-blend approach. We find that our method enables users to accomplish tasks more quickly while utilizing less input. However, when asked to rate each system, users were mixed in their assessment, citing a tradeoff between maintaining control authority and accomplishing tasks quickly.},

  abstract = {Assistive robots enable people with disabilities to conduct everyday tasks on their own. However, these tasks can be complex, containing both coarse reaching motions and fine-grained manipulation. For example, when eating, not only does one need to move to the correct food item, but they must also precisely manipulate the food in different ways (e.g., cutting, stabbing, scooping). Shared autonomy methods make robot teleoperation safer and more precise by arbitrating user inputs with robot controls. However, these works have focused mainly on the high-level task of reaching a goal from a discrete set, while largely ignoring manipulation of objects at that goal. Meanwhile, dimensionality reduction techniques for teleoperation map useful high-dimensional robot actions into an intuitive low-dimensional controller, but it is unclear if these methods can achieve the requisite precision for tasks like eating. Our insight is that---by combining intuitive embeddings from learned latent actions with robotic assistance from shared autonomy---we can enable precise assistive manipulation. In this work, we adopt learned latent actions for shared autonomy by proposing a new model structure that changes the meaning of the human's input based on the robot's confidence of the goal. We show convergence bounds on the robot's distance to the most likely goal, and develop a training procedure to learn a controller that is able to move between goals even in the presence of shared autonomy. We evaluate our method in simulations and an eating user study. See videos of our experiments here: https://youtu.be/7BouKojzVyk},

  abstract = {Learning robotic control policies in the real world gives rise to challenges in data efficiency, safety, and controlling the initial condition of the system. On the other hand, simulations are a useful alternative as they provide an abundant source of data without the restrictions of the real world. Unfortunately, simulations often fail to accurately model complex real-world phenomena. Traditional system identification techniques are limited in expressiveness by the analytical model parameters, and usually are not sufficient to capture such phenomena. In this paper we propose a general framework for improving the analytical model by optimizing state dependent generalized forces. State dependent generalized forces are expressive enough to model constraints in the equations of motion, while maintaining a clear physical meaning and intuition. We use reinforcement learning to efficiently optimize the mapping from states to generalized forces over a discounted infinite horizon. We show that using only minutes of real world data improves the sim-to-real control policy transfer. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach by validating it on a nonprehensile manipulation task on the Sawyer robot.},

  abstract = {Conventional feedback control methods can solve various types of robot control problems very efficiently by capturing the structure with explicit models, such as rigid body equations of motion. However, many control problems in modern manufacturing deal with contacts and friction, which are difficult to capture with first-order physical modeling. Hence, applying control design methodologies to these kinds of problems often results in brittle and inaccurate controllers, which have to be manually tuned for deployment. Reinforcement learning (RL) methods have been demonstrated to be capable of learning continuous robot controllers from interactions with the environment, even for problems that include friction and contacts. In this paper, we study how we can solve difficult control problems in the real world by decomposing them into a part that is solved efficiently by conventional feedback control methods, and the residual which is solved with RL. The final control policy is a superposition of both control signals. We demonstrate our approach by training an agent to successfully perform a real-world block assembly task involving contacts and unstable objects.},

This way the system is also able to make use of abstract expert knowledge by incorporating process descriptions and quality evaluation metrics. We evaluate various state-of-the-art schemes for the meta parameter learning and experimentally compare selected ones. Our results clearly indicate that the combination of our adaptive impedance controller with a carefully defined skill formalism significantly reduces the complexity of manipulation tasks even for learning peg-in-hole with submillimeter industrial tolerances. Overall, the considered system is able to learn variations of this skill in under 20 minutes. In fact, experimentally the system was able to perform the learned tasks faster than humans, leading to the first learning-based solution of complex assembly at such real-world performance.},

  abstract = {We propose a general modeling and inference framework that composes probabilistic graphical models with deep learning methods and combines their respective strengths. Our model family augments graphical structure in latent variables with neural network observation models. For inference, we extend variational autoencoders to use graphical model approximating distributions with recognition networks that output conjugate potentials. All components of these models are learned simultaneously with a single objective, giving a scalable algorithm that leverages stochastic variational inference, natural gradients, graphical model message passing, and the reparameterization trick. We illustrate this framework with several example models and an application to mouse behavioral phenotyping.},

The integrated control that is composed of feedback control, feedforward control and disturbance observer is adopted in this paper as the control framework that can effectively address the control problems of the flexible system. However, it is difficult to optimize all the parameters of the integrated control, because the number of the parameters to be optimized is larger than the conventional feedback control, which complicates the optimization procedure. In this paper, the optimization procedure of the integrated control as well as the mathematical background of it is proposed. At first, the closed-loop characteristics of the integrated control is analyzed and its convexity with respect to control parameters is theoretically investigated. The proposed optimization method is designed taking into consideration the convexity of the control configuration to guarantee the global optimality of the obtained parameters. Moreover, the proposed method can simultaneously optimize all the parameters of the integrated controller based on the experimental data. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is experimentally confirmed using a flexible system under two conditions: 1) change of initial parameters and 2) change of plant conditions.},

Specifically, we abstract the problem as a Markov decision process in which the expected performance is measured using a cost function that is unknown prior to run-time exploration of the state space. Standard learning approaches synthesize cost-optimal strategies without guaranteeing safety properties. To remedy this, we first compute safe, permissive strategies. Then, exploration is constrained to these strategies and thereby meets the imposed safety requirements. Exploiting an iterative learning procedure, the resulting policy is safety-constrained and optimal. We show correctness and completeness of the method and discuss the use of several heuristics to increase its scalability. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability by means of a prototype implementation.},

  abstract = {Humans skillfully manipulate objects and tools despite the inherent instability. In order to succeed at these tasks, the sensorimotor control system must build an internal representation of both the force and mechanical impedance. As it is not practical to either learn or store motor commands for every possible future action, the sensorimotor control system generalizes a control strategy for a range of movements based on learning performed over a set of movements. Here, we introduce a computational model for this learning and generalization, which specifies how to learn feedforward muscle activity in a function of the state space. Specifically, by incorporating co-activation as a function of error into the feedback command, we are able to derive an algorithm from a gradient descent minimization of motion error and effort, subject to maintaining a stability margin. This algorithm can be used to learn to coordinate any of a variety of motor primitives such as force fields, muscle synergies, physical models or artificial neural networks. This model for human learning and generalization is able to adapt to both stable and unstable dynamics, and provides a controller for generating efficient adaptive motor behavior in robots. Simulation results exhibit predictions consistent with all experiments on learning of novel dynamics requiring adaptation of force and impedance, and enable us to re-examine some of the previous interpretations of experiments on generalization.},

RDE had emerged earlier in the study of the second variations in the calculus of variations, but its use in general linear systems, where the optimal trajectory needs to be generated by a control input, was new. The analysis throughout the paper concentrates on timevarying systems, and uses the Hamilton-Jacobi theory to arrive at RDE and to deduce optimality of the LQ control gain. We now know, however, that an alternative way to prove optimality in least squares is by showing how RDE allows one to "complete the square" (see, e.g., [5], [18]).},

Based on static performance measures such as task-space stiffness and manipulability, and constraints such as joint stress, mechanism size, and workspace volume, we pose the design problem as a multiobjective optimization. We first calculate the Pareto frontier, which can then be used to select the desired design parameters based on secondary criteria, such as performance sensitivity and dynamic characteristics. To facilitate design iteration, we apply the pseudo rigid-body approach with a lumped approximation of the flexure joints. A planar mechanism is used to illustrate the analysis and design techniques.},

Human intention is classified into two categories-direct and indirect. With respect to direct intention, the concept of standard force is introduced to adjust the interacting force. The proposed variable admittance control method improves intuitiveness when velocity is used as an estimate of direct intention. In the estimation of indirect intention, a force guidance method is suggested to make a robot follow and guide a human. The proposed control methodology is adapted to a six-DOF manipulator based on a one-dimensional analysis. The experiments are conducted with a manipulator (Universal Robots, UR10) and a force/torque sensor (Robotus, RFT60-HA) to evaluate the performance. The experiments validate that variable admittance control enhances the execution time, accuracy, and comfort of the operator.},

Here, we derive the forward and reverse-mode derivatives of the solutions to all three types of equations, and showcase their application on an inverse control problem.},

This paper studies nonparametric identifiability of type probabilities and type-specific component distributions in finite mixture models of dynamic discrete choices. We derive sufficient conditions for nonparametric identification for various finite mixture models of dynamic discrete choices used in applied work under different assumptions on the Markov property, stationarity, and type-invariance in the transition process. Three elements emerge as the important determinants of identification: the time-dimension of panel data, the number of values the covariates can take, and the heterogeneity of the response of different types to changes in the covariates. For example, in a simple case where the transition function is type-invariant, a time-dimension of T = 3 is sufficient for identification, provided that the number of values the covariates can take is no smaller than the number of types and that the changes in the covariates induce sufficiently heterogeneous variations in the choice probabilities across types. Identification is achieved even when state dependence is present if a model is stationary first-order Markovian and the panel has a moderate time-dimension (T ≥ 6).}

Brach's collision model is used for our collision model-based approach for a rigid body because it is computationally light-weighted and enables the sampling of three collision properties for the particle filter. The validity of our method is experimentally demonstrated by achieving the highest success rate using the reasonable computation resources required (average of 3.9 milliseconds and worst of 6.1 milliseconds with our setup), and verifying each computation resource (or number of particles) based on the size of motion estimation error in the pre-capture phase.},

To realize superior high-robust stability, this paper proposes a high-robust force control based on the duality of the two-inertia system. This paper constructs an equivalent RRC (ERRC) combining the motor-side velocity control and the load-side velocity observer and demonstrates a torque-velocity duality. The results confirm that the load-side torque control based on ERRC is robust against \$K\_e\$ variation through the analysis of open-loop characteristics, and illustrate that the ERRC the same as the conventional RRC proposed in position or velocity controls. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is validated through numerical simulations and experiments.},

  abstract = {Physical compliance can be considered one of the key technical properties a robot should exhibit to increase its mechanical robustness. In addition, the accompanying temporal energy-storing capabilities enable explosive and energy efficient cyclic motions. But these advantages come at a price, as compliance introduces unwanted intrinsic oscillatory dynamics, underactuation, and reduces the natural frequency of the plant. These aspects make control of the link configuration variables a challenging task. This paper presents two novel control methods for implementing link-side motion tracking capabilities and injecting a desired damping characteristic to suppress link vibrations along the reference trajectory for compliantly actuated robots with nonlinear elastic characteristics. We prove their uniform global asymptotic stability by invoking a theorem by Matrosov. Both approaches, namely elastic structure preserving (ESP) and ESP+, have in common that they preserve the link-side inertial properties and the elastic structure of the original plant dynamics, hence the name ESP control. Apart from that, ESP control focuses on preserving the inertial properties of motor dynamics. While ESP+ control aims at minimizing the dynamic shaping on the motor side. The performance of the feedback control laws have been evaluated on the Hand Arm System from the German Aerospace Center (DLR), a variable stiffness robot arm, where the stiffness in each of its joints is highly nonlinear. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimentally validated tracking controller for compliantly actuated, multijoint robots with nonlinear elastic elements.},

Recently, the concept of variable impedance control (VIC) was adopted into RL with encouraging results. However, the more important issue of stability remains unaddressed. To clarify the challenge in stable RL, we introduce the term all-the-time-stability that unambiguously means that every possible rollout will be stability certified. Our contribution is a model-free RL method that not only adopts VIC but also achieves all-the-time-stability. Building on a recently proposed stable VIC controller as the policy parameterization, we introduce a novel policy search algorithm that is inspired by Cross-Entropy Method and inherently guarantees stability. As a part of our extensive experimental studies, we report, to the best of our knowledge, the first successful application of RL with all-the-time-stability on the benchmark problem of peg-in-hole.},

  abstract = {Successful execution of many robotic tasks requires precise control of robot motion and its interaction with the environment. In robotics these two problems are mainly studied separately in the domain of robot motion generation and interaction control, respectively. Existing approaches rely on two control loops: a motion generator (planner) that provides a reference trajectory in the outer loop, and an active impedance controller that tracks the reference trajectory in the inner loop. Ensuring stability of the closed-loop system for this control architecture is nontrivial. In this paper, we propose a single-loop control architecture that performs motion generation and interaction control at once. We model robot discrete motions with a time-invariant dynamical system, which is expressed as a nonlinear combination of a set of linear spring-damper systems. This formulation represents the nominal motion and the impedance properties with a single set of parameters, simplifying stability analysis of the closed-loop system. We provide sufficient conditions to ensure global asymptotic stability of this system for movements in free-space, and its passivity during persistent contact with a passive environment. We validate our approach in simulation using the 7-DoF KUKA LWR-IV robot.},

  abstract = {We study event-triggered control for stabilization of unstable linear plants over rate-limited communication channels subject to unknown bounded delay. On one hand, the timing of event triggering carries implicit information about the state of the plant. On the other hand, the delay in the communication channel causes information loss, as it makes the state information available at the controller out of date. Combining these two effects, we show a phase transition behavior in the transmission rate required for stabilization using a given event-triggering strategy. For small values of the delay, the timing information carried by the triggering events is substantial, and the system can be stabilized with any positive rate. When the delay exceeds a critical threshold, the timing information alone is not enough to achieve stabilization, and the required rate grows. When the delay equals the inverse of the entropy rate of the plant, the implicit information carried by the triggering events perfectly compensates the loss of information due to the communication delay, and we recover the rate requirement prescribed by the data-rate theorem. We also provide an explicit construction yielding a sufficient rate for stabilization, as well as results for vector systems. Our results do not rely on any a priori probabilistic model for the delay or the initial conditions.},

We propose a geometric framework, drawing on tools from the manifold reconstruction literature, to analyze the high-dimensional geometry of adversarial examples. In particular, we highlight the importance of codimension: for low-dimensional data manifolds embedded in high-dimensional space there are many directions off the manifold in which to construct adversarial examples. Adversarial examples are a natural consequence of learning a decision boundary that classifies the low-dimensional data manifold well, but classifies points near the manifold incorrectly. Using our geometric framework we prove (1) a tradeoff between robustness under different norms, (2) that adversarial training in balls around the data is sample inefficient, and (3) sufficient sampling conditions under which nearest neighbor classifiers and ball-based adversarial training are robust.},

  abstract = {In this paper, we investigate a methodology for the conceptual synthesis of compliant mechanisms based on a building block approach. The building block approach is intuitive and provides key insight into how individual building blocks contribute to the overall function. We investigate the basic kinematic behavior of individual building blocks and relate this to the behavior of a design composed of building blocks. This serves to not only generate viable solutions but also to augment the understanding of the designer. Once a feasible concept is thus generated, known methods for size and geometry optimization may be employed to fine-tune performance. The key enabler of the building block synthesis is the method of capturing kinematic behavior using compliance ellipsoids. The mathematical model of the compliance ellipsoids facilitates the characterization of the building blocks, transformation of problem specifications, decomposition into subproblems, and the ability to search for alternate solutions. The compliance ellipsoids also give insight into how individual building blocks contribute to the overall kinematic function. The effectiveness and generality of the methodology are demonstrated through two synthesis examples. Using only a limited set of building blocks, the methodology is capable of addressing generic kinematic problem specifications for compliance at a single point and for a single-input, single-output compliant mechanism. A rapid prototype of the latter demonstrates the validity of the conceptual solution.},

One of the major reasons that make it difficult is uncertainty. Because parts assembly involves physical contact between objects, it requires higher precision than other manipulation tasks like collision avoidance. The key idea of this paper is to use simulation-aided physical reasoning while planning with the goal of finding a robust motion plan for parts assembly. Specifically, in the proposed approach, a) uncertainty between object poses is represented as a distribution of particles, b) the motion planner estimates the transition of particles for unit actions (motion primitives) through physics-based simulation, and c) the performance of the planner is sped up using Multi-Heuristic A* (MHA*) search that utilizes multiple inadmissible heuristics that lead to fast uncertainty reduction. To demonstrate the benefits of our framework, motion planning and physical robot experiments for several parts assembly tasks are provided.},

In human robot interaction (HRI), constrained collisions can be particularly hazardous to the human and recently, collision test devices were developed that assess safety in such scenarios. In this paper, we propose the concept of a constrained collision force map (CCFM), which relates the robot impact velocity and the collision reaction method its parameterization to the peak collision force in a constrained collision scenario. The CCFM is a tool that will help practitioners to implement both safe and efficient HRI applications and to understand the robot’s collision behavior. In this work, we derive the CCFM for three robots (UR10e, UR5e, and Franka Emika Panda) for varying contact thresholds, contact stiffnesses, and robot poses. Finally, we compare our results with the force estimation suggested by ISO/TS 15066:2016.},

Empowerment as a measure reflects the properties of the apparatus as long as they are observable due to the coupling of sensors and actuators via the environment.

  abstract = {Recently, soft robots that consist of soft and deformable materials have received much attention for their adaptability to uncertain environments. Although these robots are difficult to control with a conventional control theory owing to their complex body dynamics, research from different perspectives attempts to actively exploit these body dynamics as an asset rather than a drawback. This approach is called morphological computation, in which the soft materials are used for computation that includes a new kind of control strategy. In this article, we propose a novel approach to analyze the computational properties of soft materials based on an algebraic method, called the input–output equation used in systems analysis, particularly in systems biology. We mainly focus on the two scenarios relevant to soft robotics, that is, analysis of the computational capabilities of soft materials and design of the input force to soft devices to generate the target behaviors. The input–output equation directly describes the relationship between inputs and outputs of a system, and hence by using this equation, important properties, such as the echo state property that guarantees reproducible responses against the same input stream, can be investigated for soft structures. Several application scenarios of our proposed method are demonstrated using typical soft robotic settings in detail, including linear/nonlinear models and hydrogels driven by chemical reactions.},

We present the first efficient randomized algorithm providing a constant factor (1 − 1/e − ε) approximation guarantee for any ε {$>$} 0 with high confidence. The algorithm leverages the theory of submodular functions, in combination with a polynomial bound on sample complexity. We furthermore prove that no polynomial time algorithm can provide a constant factor approximation better than (1 − 1/e) unless P = NP. Finally, we provide extensive evidence of the effectiveness of our method on two complex real-world datasets.},

They admit an intuitive probabilistic interpretation, have a simple functional form, and enjoy widespread adoption. We introduce a unified algorithm to efficiently learn a broad class of linear and non-linear state space models, including variants where the emission and transition distributions are modeled by deep neural networks. Our learning algorithm simultaneously learns a compiled inference network and the generative model, leveraging a structured variational approximation parameterized by recurrent neural networks to mimic the posterior distribution. We apply the learning algorithm to both synthetic and real-world datasets, demonstrating its scalability and versatility. We find that using the structured approximation to the posterior results in models with significantly higher held-out likelihood.},

The robot can perform actions to transition between phases and, thus, alter the effects of its actions, e.g. grasp an object in order to then lift it. The robot can thus reach a phase that affords the desired manipulation. In this paper, we present an approach for exploiting the phase structure of tasks in order to learn manipulation skills more efficiently. Starting with human demonstrations, the robot learns a probabilistic model of the phases and the phase transitions. The robot then employs model-based reinforcement learning to create a library of motor primitives for transitioning between phases. The learned motor primitives generalize to new situations and tasks. Given this library, the robot uses a value function approach to learn a high-level policy for sequencing the motor primitives. The proposed method was successfully evaluated on a real robot performing a bimanual grasping task.},

Learning will be central to such autonomous systems, as the real world contains too much variation for a robot to expect to have an accurate model of its environment, the objects in it, or the skills required to manipulate them, in advance. We aim to survey a representative subset of that research which uses machine learning for manipulation.

For this purpose, we present a method to learn shared control policies from demonstrations offered by a human assistant. We train a Gaussian process (GP) regression model to continuously regulate the level of assistance between the user and the robot, given the user's previous and current actions and the state of the environment. The assistance policy is learned after only a single human demonstration, i.e., in one-shot. Our technique is evaluated in a one-of-a-kind experimental study, where the machine-learned shared control policy is compared to human assistance. Our analyses show that our technique is successful in emulating human shared control, by matching the location and amount of offered assistance on different trajectories. We observed that the effort requirement of the users were comparable between human-robot and human-human settings. Under the learned policy, the jerkiness of the user's joystick movements dropped significantly, despite a significant increase in the jerkiness of the robot assistant's commands. In terms of performance, even though the robotic assistance increased task completion time, the average distance to obstacles stayed in similar ranges to human assistance.},

  abstract = {In robotics, lower-level controllers are typically used to make the robot solve a specific task in a fixed context. For example, the lower-level controller can encode a hitting movement while the context defines the target coordinates to hit. However, in many learning problems the context may change between task executions. To adapt the policy to a new context, we utilize a hierarchical approach by learning an upper-level policy that generalizes the lower-level controllers to new contexts. A common approach to learn such upper-level policies is to use policy search. However, the majority of current contextual policy search approaches are model-free and require a high number of interactions with the robot and its environment. Model-based approaches are known to significantly reduce the amount of robot experiments, however, current model-based techniques cannot be applied straightforwardly to the problem of learning contextual upper-level policies. They rely on specific parametrizations of the policy and the reward function, which are often unrealistic in the contextual policy search formulation. In this paper, we propose a novel model-based contextual policy search algorithm that is able to generalize lower-level controllers, and is data-efficient. Our approach is based on learned probabilistic forward models and information theoretic policy search. Unlike current algorithms, our method does not require any assumption on the parametrization of the policy or the reward function. We show on complex simulated robotic tasks and in a real robot experiment that the proposed learning framework speeds up the learning process by up to two orders of magnitude in comparison to existing methods, while learning high quality policies.},

Partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) provide a principled mathematical framework for solving such problems, but they are often avoided in robotics due to high computational complexity. Our goal is to create practical POMDP algorithms and software for common robotic tasks. To this end, we have developed a new point-based POMDP algorithm that exploits the notion of optimally reachable belief spaces to improve computational efficiency. In simulation, we successfully applied the algorithm to a set of common robotic tasks, including instances of coastal navigation, grasping, mobile robot exploration, and target tracking, all modeled as POMDPs with a large number of states. In most of the instances studied, our algorithm substantially outperformed one of the fastest existing point-based algorithms. A software package implementing our algorithm will soon be released at http://motion.comp.nus.edu.sg/ projects/pomdp/pomdp.html.},

  abstract = {In this work we consider the current certification process of applications with physical human–robot interaction (pHRI). Two major hazards are collisions and clamping scenarios. The implementation of safety measures in pHRI applications typically depends strongly on coordinates, e.g., to monitor the robot velocity or to predict external forces. We show that the current certification process does not, in general, guarantee a safe robot behavior. In particular, in unstructured environments it is not possible to predict all risks in advance. We therefore propose to control the energy of the robot, which is a coordinate invariant entity. For an impedance controlled robot, the total energy consists of potential energy and kinetic energy. The energy flow from task description to physical interaction follows a strict causality. We assign a safe energy budget for the robot. With this energy budget, the presented controller auto-tunes its parameters to limit the exchanged kinetic energy during a collision and the potential energy during clamping scenarios. In contact, the robot behaves compliantly and therefore eliminates clamping danger. After contact, the robot automatically continues to follow the desired trajectory. With this approach the number of safety-related parameters to be determined can be reduced to one energy value, which has the potential to significantly speed up the commissioning of pHRI applications. The proposed technique is validated by experiments.},

Various machine learning techniques have been proposed to give the robot such adaptability features. This paper proposes a modelbased evolutionary optimization algorithm to tune the apparent impedance of a wrist rehabilitation device. We used passivity to define boundaries for the possible controller outcomes, limiting the shared autonomy of the robot and ensuring the coupled system stability. The experiment consists of a hardware-in-theloop optimization and a one-degree-of-freedom robot used for wrist rehabilitation. Experimental results showed that the proposed technique could generate customized passive impedance controllers for three subjects. Furthermore, when compared with a constant impedance controller, the method suggested decreased in 20\% the root mean square of interaction torques while maintaining stability during optimization.},

The analysis of compliance properties and rotational precision for RCC mechanisms are very important for mechanical design in applications where precision is required. This paper formulates an analytical method for the compliance and rotational precision calculations of a class of RCC mechanisms, combined in parallel with two round beam-based isosceles-trapezoidal flexural pivots. The analytical model of the mechanism is established based on the stiffness matrix method to directly obtain the compliance factors that completely define the elastic response of the mechanism. The rotational precision of the mechanism—That is, the position of rotation center—Is then derived using screw theory and a compliance matrix. The validity of this model is demonstrated using finite element analysis simulation and experimental tests. The results of both simulation and experiment verify that the analytical model has high accuracy and promising practical applications. Moreover, the influences of the geometry parameters on the compliance factors and the center shifts are also graphically evaluated and discussed using the analytical model. The results in this paper provide an effective configuration and analytical method for the design and optimization of RCC mechanisms, and are of great practical significance.},

By utilizing the uncertainty in the constraints we are able to take into account regression deviation directly in the MPC constraints. This thesis has studied the effectiveness of using the GP with MPC constraints, with the special focus on the stability of the predictions. We have looked at two different systems, a stable four-tank system with slow dynamics, and a vehicle model with obstacle avoidance using a hybrid-GP model. This showed the interesting property that the accuracy of the prediction is determined by the stability properties in the system we like to control. We were able to keep the tank system stable without any problems, while the hybrid-GP in the car system suffered from divergence and exponential growth in uncertainty, even though the regression validation showed that the hybrid-GP should have better accuracy. Multi-step prediction in a marginally stable or unstable system can result in the divergence in the predictions due to minuscule errors. Taken this into account, the GP show great promise in the field of adaptive control as an effective method of adapting to system changes, where the uncertainty can give a good estimate of the prediction error.},

  abstract = {Programming robotic assembly for industrial small-batch production is challenging; hence, it is vital to increase robustness and reduce development effort in order to achieve flexible robotic automation. A human who has made an assembly error will often simply undo the process until the error is undone and then restart the assembly. Conceptually, robots could do the same. This paper introduces a programming model that enables robot assembly programs to be executed in reverse. We investigate the challenges in running robot programs backwards and present a classification of reversibility characteristics. We demonstrate how temporarily switching the direction of program execution can be an efficient error recovery mechanism. Moreover, we demonstrate additional benefits arising from supporting reversibility in an assembly language, such as increased code reuse and automatically derived disassembly sequences. As a default approach to reversibility, we use program inversion and statement-level inversion of commands, but with a novel override option providing alternative sequences for asymmetric reverse actions. To efficiently program for this model, this paper introduces a new domain-specific language, SCP-RASQ (Simple C++ Reversible Assembly SeQuences). In initial experiments, where 200 consecutive assemblies of two industrial cases were performed, 18 of 22 errors were corrected automatically using only the trial-and-error capabilities that come from reverse execution.},

  pages = {77},
  abstract = {This paper presents an unusual perspective on sensing uncertainty and filtering with the intention of understanding what information is minimally needed to achieve a specified task. Information itself is modeled using information space concepts, which originated from dynamic game theory (rather than information theory, which was developed mainly for communication). The guiding principle in this paper is avoid sensing, representing, and encoding more than is necessary. The concepts and tools are motivated by many tasks of current interest, such as tracking, monitoring, navigation, pursuit-evasion, exploration, and mapping. First, an overview of sensors that appear in numerous systems is presented. Following this, the notion of a virtual sensor is explained, which provides a mathematical way to model numerous sensors while abstracting away their particular physical implementation. Dozens of useful models are given, each as a mapping from the physical world to the set of possible sensor outputs. Preimages with respect to this mapping represent a fundamental source of uncertainty: These are equivalence classes of physical states that would produce the same sensor output. Pursuing this idea further, the powerful notion of a sensor lattice is introduced, in which all possible virtual sensors can be rigorously compared. The next part introduces filters that aggregate information from multiple sensor readings. The integration of information over space and time is considered. In the spatial setting, classical triangulation methods are expressed in terms of preimages. In the temporal setting, an information-space framework is introduced that encompasses familiar Kalman and Bayesian filters, but also introduces a novel family called combinatorial filters. Finally, the planning problem is presented in terms of filters and information spaces. The paper concludes with some discussion about connections to many related research fields and numerous open problems and future research directions.},

Planning-based approaches represent one class of trajectory synthesis methods for active robotic partners. To overcome the limitations of kinematic planning algorithms in dynamic tasks, we propose a three-step approach to the synthesis of trajectories under the principle of least action. This is motivated by neuroscientific findings on human effort minimization in motor tasks. A trajectory is generated by optimized sequencing of optimal motion primitives. The benefits of the proposed method for physical human-robot cooperation are demonstrated in human user studies in a 2D cooperative transport task in a virtual maze.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a noble variable remote center compliance (VRCC) is developed. The VRCC has a simple structure to change the position of compliance center and to lock the VRCC. The VRCC consists of a top plate, a bottom plate and two modified elastomer shear pads (ESP). The modified ESP has a hole in its stiffness axis, and a stiffness adjusting rod (SAR) is inserted into the hole of the ESP. The stiffness of the modified ESP can be adjusted according to the insertion depth of the SAR so that the compliance center of the VRCC, which depends on the stiffness of the ESP, can be adjusted freely. Furthermore, by passing the SAR through the modified ESP, the VRCC can be locked easily. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed VRCC, a prototype VRCC is made and the variation of the compliance center is measured according to the insertion depth of the SAR. Note to Practitioners-This paper was motivated to reduce the number of machine tools which were used in connecting electric plugs in factory. But, this work is also applied to assembly machines which require inserting a round peg into a round hole. The existing machine tool can connect only one electric peg with fixed length, so various machine tools are needed according to the lengths of plugs. The proposed idea shows the way to solve this problem. By extending working capacity of the machine tool, it is possible that electric plugs with various lengths are connected by one machine tool and, consequently, the changing time and cost of machine tools can be reduced. The developed method removes changing of the machine tool. However, manual adjustment of the proposed machine tool is still needed to connect electric plugs with various lengths. Therefore, in the future research, motorized adjusting structure will be added to the proposed idea to improve manual adjustment of the machine tool.},

The PSPM modulates the original set-position signal in such a way that the modulated signal is as close to the original signal as possible (i.e., maximum information recovery for better performance), yet only to the extent permissible by the available energy in the system (i.e., passivity constraints). We present its algorithm and theoretically show its passivity and performance. We also show how this PSPM can be applied for two applications, with some experimental results: Internet teleoperation with varying delay and packet loss; and haptics with slow and variable-rate data update.},

Although the residual method demonstrates online torque estimation capability in diverse applications and thus becomes popular, it is practically challenging to achieve accurate estimation performance in a wide stiffness range of SEAs. The performance degradation is mainly induced by inaccurate transmission torque information, which is stemmed from unexpected errors in the spring deflection based torque sensing. To overcome the issue, this letter analyses the limitation of the conventional approach in frequency domain and proposes the enhanced residual to be used over a wide stiffness range of SEAs. The performance of proposed method is comparatively verified with conventional method in the both of simulations and experiments.},

  abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can use high-capacity deep networks to learn directly from image observations. However, these kinds of observation spaces present a number of challenges in practice, since the policy must now solve two problems: a representation learning problem, and a task learning problem. In this paper, we aim to explicitly learn representations that can accelerate reinforcement learning from images. We propose the stochastic latent actor-critic (SLAC) algorithm: a sample-efficient and high-performing RL algorithm for learning policies for complex continuous control tasks directly from high-dimensional image inputs. SLAC learns a compact latent representation space using a stochastic sequential latent variable model, and then learns a critic model within this latent space. By learning a critic within a compact state space, SLAC can learn much more efficiently than standard RL methods. The proposed model improves performance substantially over alternative representations as well, such as variational autoencoders. In fact, our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the sample efficiency of our resulting method is comparable to that of model-based RL methods that directly use a similar type of model for control. Furthermore, our method outperforms both model-free and model-based alternatives in terms of final performance and sample efficiency, on a range of difficult image-based control tasks. Our code and videos of our results are available at our website.},

  abstract = {Traditional robotic approaches rely on an accurate model of the environment, a detailed description of how to perform the task, and a robust perception system to keep track of the current state. On the other hand, reinforcement learning approaches can operate directly from raw sensory inputs with only a reward signal to describe the task, but are extremely sample-inefficient and brittle. In this work, we combine the strengths of model-based methods with the flexibility of learning-based methods to obtain a general method that is able to overcome inaccuracies in the robotics perception/actuation pipeline, while requiring minimal interactions with the environment. This is achieved by leveraging uncertainty estimates to divide the space in regions where the given model-based policy is reliable, and regions where it may have flaws or not be well defined. In these uncertain regions, we show that a locally learned-policy can be used directly with raw sensory inputs.

In engineering tasks, using a force sensor is the norm for control the robot through the interaction force between the human and the robot. However, the force measured from the force sensor contains the force intended by human motion and the natural force feedback generated by the robot movement and the human hand impedance due to the coupled dynamics. Therefore, it is necessary to characterize the human hand dynamics to improve transparency. However, it is difficult to estimate the human hand impedance, which is the primary source of natural force feedback in real-time. This paper proposes a real-time adaptive hand impedance compensator to enhance transparency in various pHRi conditions with human hand dynamics. The proposed algorithm regulates the impedance compensator’s parameters to find optimal values that minimize the energy-based cost function using Simultaneous Perturbation Stochastic Approximation (SPSA) and AMSGrad. SPSA is a useful method when the exact relationship between the parameters and the cost function is unknown. AMSGrad is a state-of-the-art technique widely used as an adaptive learning rate method in deep learning fields. The proposed real-time adaptive impedance compensator decreases the influence of natural force feedback by updating the parameter appropriately depending on the pHRi conditions, thus improving the transparency.},

Our algorithm solves a sequence of convex quadratic constrained optimization problems of size n · N , where n is the number of states, and N is the prediction horizon in the model predictive control problem. Compared to existing methods, our approach solves convex problems while guaranteeing that all realizations of uncertainty set do not violate safety constraints. Moreover, we consider the implicit time-discretization of system dynamics to increase the prediction horizon and enhance computational accuracy. Numerical simulations for vehicle navigation demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.},

  abstract = {Representation learning algorithms are designed to learn abstract features that characterize data. State representation learning (SRL) focuses on a particular kind of representation learning where learned features are in low dimension, evolve through time, and are influenced by actions of an agent. The representation is learned to capture the variation in the environment generated by the agent’s actions; this kind of representation is particularly suitable for robotics and control scenarios. In particular, the low dimension characteristic of the representation helps to overcome the curse of dimensionality, provides easier interpretation and utilization by humans and can help improve performance and speed in policy learning algorithms such as reinforcement learning. This survey aims at covering the state-of-the-art on state representation learning in the most recent years. It reviews different SRL methods that involve interaction with the environment, their implementations and their applications in robotics control tasks (simulated or real). In particular, it highlights how generic learning objectives are differently exploited in the reviewed algorithms. Finally, it discusses evaluation methods to assess the representation learned and summarizes current and future lines of research.},

Analysis of coupled stability of a three-port network can be accomplished in either the passivity or the absolute stability frameworks assuming all three ports are connected to passive but otherwise unknown terminations. This paper first reviews our recent results in terms of passivity and absolute stability criteria for general three-port networks - both criteria are founded on the properties of a positive-real Hermitian matrix. Next, we show that the absolute stability criterion is less conservative than the passivity criterion and that the two criteria become the same when the trilateral system is represented by a reciprocal immitance matrix. Then, to show how the two criteria may be utilized at the system design stage, we apply them to the problem of designing controllers for a dual-user haptic teleoperation system. Using the two criteria, controllers are then designed and compared in terms of conservatism and performance in simulations.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a position-space-based reconfiguration (PSR) approach to the reconfiguration of compliant mechanisms. The PSR approach can be employed to reconstruct a compliant mechanism into many new compliant mechanisms, without affecting the mobility of the compliant mechanism. Such a compliant mechanism can be decomposed into rigid stages and compliant modules. Each of the compliant modules can be placed at any one permitted position within its position space, which does not change the constraint imposed by the compliant module on the compliant mechanism. Therefore, a compliant mechanism can be reconfigured through selecting different permitted positions of the associated compliant modules from their position spaces. The proposed PSR approach can be used to change the geometrical shape of a compliant mechanism for easy fabrication, or to improve its motion characteristics such as cross-axis coupling, lost motion, and motion range. While this paper focuses on reducing the parasitic motions of a compliant mechanism using this PSR approach, the associated procedure is summarized and demonstrated using a decoupled XYZ compliant parallel mechanism as an example. The parasitic motion of the XYZ compliant parallel mechanism is modeled analytically, with three variables which represent any permitted positions of the associated compliant modules in their position spaces. The optimal positions of the compliant modules in the XYZ compliant parallel mechanism are finally obtained based on the analytical results, where the parasitic motion is reduced by approximately 50\%. The reduction of the parasitic motion is verified by finite-element analysis (FEA) results, which differ from the analytically obtained values by less than 7\%.},

  abstract = {Numerous works have been conducted on modelling basic compliant elements such as wire beams, and closed-form analytical models of most basic compliant elements have been well developed. However, the modelling of complex compliant mechanisms is still a challenging work. This paper proposes a constraint-force-based (CFB) modelling approach to model compliant mechanisms with a particular emphasis on modelling complex compliant mechanisms. The proposed CFB modelling approach can be regarded as an improved free-body-diagram (FBD) based modelling approach, and can be extended to a development of the screw-theory-based design approach. A compliant mechanism can be decomposed into rigid stages and compliant modules. A compliant module can offer elastic forces due to its deformation. Such elastic forces are regarded as variable constraint forces in the CFB modelling approach. Additionally, the CFB modelling approach defines external forces applied on a compliant mechanism as constant constraint forces. If a compliant mechanism is at static equilibrium, all the rigid stages are also at static equilibrium under the influence of the variable and constant constraint forces. Therefore, the constraint force equilibrium equations for all the rigid stages can be obtained, and the analytical model of the compliant mechanism can be derived based on the constraint force equilibrium equations. The CFB modelling approach can model a compliant mechanism linearly and nonlinearly, can obtain displacements of any points of the rigid stages, and allows external forces to be exerted on any positions of the rigid stages. Compared with the FBD based modelling approach, the CFB modelling approach does not need to identify the possible deformed configuration of a complex compliant mechanism to obtain the geometric compatibility conditions and the force equilibrium equations. Additionally, the mathematical expressions in the CFB approach have an easily understood physical meaning. Using the CFB modelling approach, the variable constraint forces of three compliant modules, a wire beam, a fourbeam compliant module and an eight-beam compliant module, have been derived in this paper. Based on these variable constraint forces, the linear and non-linear models of a decoupled XYZ compliant parallel mechanism are derived, and verified by FEA simulations and experimental tests.},

Our deep generative model learns a latent representation of the data which is split into a static and dynamic part, allowing us to approximately disentangle latent time-dependent features (dynamics) from features which are preserved over time (content). This architecture gives us partial control over generating content and dynamics by conditioning on either one of these sets of features. In our experiments on artificially generated cartoon video clips and voice recordings, we show that we can convert the content of a given sequence into another one by such content swapping. For audio, this allows us to convert a male speaker into a female speaker and vice versa, while for video we can separately manipulate shapes and dynamics. Furthermore, we give empirical evidence for the hypothesis that stochastic RNNs as latent state models are more efficient at compressing and generating long sequences than deterministic ones, which may be relevant for applications in video compression.},

The main challenge in this cross-domain modeling task lies in the significant scale discrepancy between the two: while our eyes perceive an entire visual scene at once, humans can only feel a small region of an object at any given moment. To connect vision and touch, we introduce new tasks of synthesizing plausible tactile signals from visual inputs as well as imagining how we interact with objects given tactile data as input. To accomplish our goals, we first equip robots with both visual and tactile sensors and collect a large-scale dataset of corresponding vision and tactile image sequences. To close the scale gap, we present a new conditional adversarial model that incorporates the scale and location information of the touch. Human perceptual studies demonstrate that our model can produce realistic visual images from tactile data and vice versa. Finally, we present both qualitative and quantitative experimental results regarding different system designs, as well as visualizing the learned representations of our model.},

In this letter, we present a controllable soft gripper based on pre-charged pneumatic soft actuators. The soft actuators, with the same design as a normal bending pneumatic soft actuator, are pre-charged with air to a preset pressure through a one-way check valve. The bending angle and bending speed of soft actuators are controlled by servomotors through tendons based on feedback data from force and proximity sensors. Kinematic models of the soft actuators are developed. Dynamic properties are experimentally studied. A prototype gripper with closed-loop control is developed for controllable grasping demonstration.},

One fundamental question in shared control is how to effectively allocate the control power to the human and robot. Researchers have been subjectively defining the arbitrate policies following conflicting principles, which resulted in great inconsistency in the policies. We attribute this inconsistency to the inconsiderateness of the multi-resource uncertainty in the human-robot system. To fill the gap, we developed a multi-source uncertainty model that was applicable to various types of uncertainty in real world, and then a general arbitration model was developed to comprehensively fuse the uncertainty and regulate the arbitration weight assigned to the robotic agent. Beside traditional macro performance metrics, we introduced objective and quantitative metrics of robotic helpfulness and friendliness that evaluated the assistive robot’s cooperation at micro and macro levels. Results from simulations and experiments showed the new arbitration model was more effective and friendly over the existing policies and was robust to coping with multi-source uncertainty. With this new arbitration model, we expect the increased adoption of human-robot shared control in practical and complex teleoperation tasks.},

For example, users would like to maneuver the end-effector compliantly in free space followed by supplying a contact force to obtain a firm adhesive connection. The technical challenges is the design of the controller, especially during the switching from human-robot interaction (human guides robot) to robot-environment interaction for the robot to continuously maintain the contact force even after the human lets go. Traditional controllers often result in unstable interaction during the switches of the controllers. Therefore, this letter proposes a control scheme that unifies impedance and admittance in the outer loop, and unifies the adaptive position and velocity control in the inner loop to address this issue. The cooperation of the cobot is divided into two modes, namely, an augmentation mode where the human force is the desired input to guide the motion of the cobot, and an autonomous mode where predefined position and force commands are used (e.g., to maintain a desired holding force). With the proposed control scheme, the physical interaction between the robot, human and environment can be smoothly and stably transited from augmentation mode to autonomous mode. Experiments are then conducted to validate the proposed approach.},

  abstract = {Kinodynamic Motion Planning (KMP) is to find a robot motion subject to concurrent kinematics and dynamics constraints. To date, quite a few methods solve KMP problems and those that exist struggle to find near-optimal solutions and exhibit high computational complexity as the planning space dimensionality increases. To address these challenges, we present a scalable, imitation learning-based, Model-Predictive Motion Planning Networks framework that quickly finds near-optimal path solutions with worst-case theoretical guarantees under kinodynamic constraints for practical underactuated systems. Our framework introduces two algorithms built on a neural generator, discriminator, and a parallelizable Model Predictive Controller (MPC). The generator outputs various informed states towards the given target, and the discriminator selects the best possible subset from them for the extension. The MPC locally connects the selected informed states while satisfying the given constraints leading to feasible, near-optimal solutions. We evaluate our algorithms on a range of cluttered, kinodynamically constrained, and underactuated planning problems with results indicating significant improvements in computation times, path qualities, and success rates over existing methods.},

We also consider an alternative definition of estimation entropy, which uses approximating functions that are not necessarily trajectories of the system, and show that the two entropy notions are equivalent. We establish an upper bound on the estimation entropy in terms of the sum of the desired convergence rate and an upper bound on the matrix measure of the Jacobian, multiplied by the system dimension. A lower bound on the estimation entropy is developed as well. We then turn our attention to state estimation and model detection with quantized and sampled state measurements. We describe an iterative procedure that uses such measurements to generate state estimates that converge to the true state at the desired exponential rate. The average bit rate utilized by this procedure matches the derived upper bound on the estimation entropy, and no other algorithm of this type can perform the same estimation task with bit rates lower than the estimation entropy. Finally, we discuss an application of the estimation procedure in determining, from the quantized state measurements, which of two competing models of a dynamical system is the true model. We show that under a mild assumption of “exponential separation” of the candidate models, detection always happens in finite time.},

Motion generation is a typical and common mechanism synthesis task, so this study takes it as the design requirement to expound the proposed method. Most of the current research work relies on numerical solution of the nonlinear Bernoulli–Euler beam model, numerical simulations or physical experiments to study the synthesis method of compliant mechanisms. There is a lack of simpler and more efficient methods to achieve motion generation of compliant mechanisms with various topologies. This study is based on pole map which is a geometric tool to describe the motion of rigid-body mechanisms. In this paper, we first demonstrate the feasibility of applying the similarity transformation of pole map to compliant mechanisms. It is proved that the pole map of compliant mechanisms has the same characteristic as rigid-body mechanisms during similarity transformation. Then we present the procedure of synthesis method in detail and expound the establishment method of function module which can avoid the functional defects of the final designed mechanism. At last, we take the compliant geared linkages and compliant four-bar linkage as examples to illustrate the novel synthesis approach. The result is an applicable and effective synthesis method for motion generation of compliant mechanisms.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

To address these challenges, a variety of techniques have been reported in a growing stream of publications. This paper surveys and compares the conceptual ideas, key advances, and applicable scopes, and open problems of the state-of-the-art kinetostatic and dynamic modeling methods for compliant mechanisms in terms of small and large deflections. Future challenges are discussed and new opportunities for extended study are highlighted as well.

This paper presents general design equations for the calculation of the rotational stiffness, maximal angular elastic deflection and rotational precision of various notch flexure hinges in dependence of the geometric hinge parameters. The novel equations are obtained on the basis of a non-linear analytical model for a moment and a transverse force loaded beam with a variable contour height. Four flexure hinge contours are investigated, the semi-circular, the cornerfilleted, the elliptical, and the recently introduced bi-quadratic polynomial contour. Depending on the contour, the error of the calculated results is in the range of less than 2 \% to less than 16 \% for the suggested parameter range compared with the analytical solution. Finite elements method (FEM) and experimental results correlate well with the predictions based on the comparatively simple and concise design equations.},

We propose an adaptation of the CFR+ algorithm for NFGSS and compare its performance to the standard methods based on linear programming and incremental game generation. We validate our approach on two security-inspired domains. We show that with a negligible loss in precision, CFR+ can compute a Nash equilibrium with five times less computation than its competitors.},

After a brief review of pomdp's, this paper discusses several simple solution methods and shows that all are capable of nding near-optimal policies for a selection of extremely small pomdp's taken from the learning literature.

The cluttered background and non-action motions limit the performances of these methods, since they lack the explicit modeling of human body movements. With recent advances of human pose estimation, this work presents a novel method to recognize human action as the evolution of pose estimation maps. Instead of relying on the inaccurate human poses estimated from videos, we observe that pose estimation maps, the byproduct of pose estimation, preserve richer cues of human body to benefit action recognition. Specifically, the evolution of pose estimation maps can be decomposed as an evolution of heatmaps, e.g., probabilistic maps, and an evolution of estimated 2D human poses, which denote the changes of body shape and body pose, respectively. Considering the sparse property of heatmap, we develop spatial rank pooling to aggregate the evolution of heatmaps as a body shape evolution image. As body shape evolution image does not differentiate body parts, we design body guided sampling to aggregate the evolution of poses as a body pose evolution image. The complementary properties between both types of images are explored by deep convolutional neural networks to predict action label. Experiments on NTU RGB+D, UTD-MHAD and PennAction datasets verify the effectiveness of our method, which outperforms most state-of-the-art methods.},

To date, a number of frequency-domain techniques have been proposed, which yield effective SEA torque and impedance control; however, these methods are accompanied by undesirable stability constraints. In this paper, we instead focus on a time-domain approach to the control of SEAs, and adapt two existing control techniques for SEA platforms. First, a model reference adaptive controller is developed, which requires no prior knowledge of system parameters and can specify desired closed-loop torque characteristics. Second, the time-domain passivity approach is modified to control desired impedances in a manner that temporarily allows the SEA to passively render impedances greater than the actuator's intrinsic stiffness. This approach also provides conditions for passivity when augmenting any stable SEA torque controller with an arbitrary impedance. The resultant techniques are experimentally validated on a custom prototype SEA.compliant actuation,frequency-domain techniquesundesirable stability constraints.},

  abstract = {Experimentation and a survey of the literature clearly show that contact stability in a force reflecting teleoperation system requires high levels of damping on the master robot. However, excessive damping increases the energy required by an operator for commanding motion. The objective of this paper is to describe a new force reflecting teleoperation methodology that reduces operator energy requirements without sacrificing stability. We begin by describing a new approach to modeling and identifying the remote environment of the teleoperation system. We combine a conventional multi-input, multi-output recursive least squares (MIMO-RLS) system identification, identifying in real-time the remote environment impedance, with a discretized representation of the remote environment. This methodology generates a time-varying, position-dependent representation of the remote environment dynamics. Next, we adapt the target impedance of the master robot with respect to the dynamic model of the remote environment. The environment estimation and impedance adaptation are executed simultaneously and in real time. We demonstrate, through experimentation, that this approach significantly reduces the energy required by an operator to execute remote tasks while simultaneously providing sufficient damping to ensure contact stability.},

  abstract = {Abstract — This paper addresses the question of how to create adaptive and smooth sequences of actions and how to decide among skill options in a continuous manner without the necessity of recurrent planning. Motion generation is based on serial and parallel blending of movement primitives (MP). MPs are modeled as dynamical systems on task coordinates with attractor behavior and augmented with additional signals to ease their coordination. Sequences and transitions between skills are realized in a unified way as bifurcating dynamical systems based on continuous-time recurrent neural networks. The neural output is used as activation signal for MPs. Besides continuous feedback from the controlled MPs, the neural dynamics is influenced by a cost term from a future prediction to allow the inhibition of an action flow that is expected to fail. First results are shown in a physical simulation environment on a high-DoF robotic hand-arm system. The system is capable of creating smooth transients of MPs. Robustness to disturbances can be observed as local adaptations of individual lowlevel MPs, flexible sequencing of MPs, and global error recovery by changing the whole strategy of how to perform a movement skill.

We concentrate on one-link flexible robot arms whose dynamic models can be represented by linear partial differential equations with appropriate boundary conditions which have been well examined in a number of papers. A key contribution of this paper is the introduction of the concept of (strict) A-dependent operators, which allows us to prove rigorously the closed loop stability of direct strain feedback and the existence and uniqueness of nonstandard second order abstract differential equations in Hilbert spaces. Several control experiments are performed, verifying the main theoretical points of this paper, demonstrating satisfactory control results of direct strain feedback, and leading to potential application of this simple control method for flexible robot control.{$<<$}ETX{$>>$}},

  abstract = {Many current autonomous systems are being designed with a strong reliance on black box predictions from deep neural networks (DNNs). However, DNNs tend to be overconfident in predictions on unseen data and can give unpredictable results for far-from-distribution test data. The importance of predictions that are robust to this distributional shift is evident for safety-critical applications, such as collision avoidance around pedestrians. Measures of model uncertainty can be used to identify unseen data, but the state-of-the-art extraction methods such as Bayesian neural networks are mostly intractable to compute. This paper uses MC-Dropout and Bootstrapping to give computationally tractable and parallelizable uncertainty estimates. The methods are embedded in a Safe Reinforcement Learning framework to form uncertainty-aware navigation around pedestrians. The result is a collision avoidance policy that \textbackslash textit\{knows what it does not know\} and cautiously avoids pedestrians that exhibit unseen behavior. The policy is demonstrated in simulation to be more robust to novel observations and take safer actions than an uncertainty-unaware baseline.},

  abstract = {Applying Deep Learning to control has a lot of potential for enabling the intelligent design of robot control laws. Unfortunately common deep learning approaches to control, such as deep reinforcement learning, require an unrealistic amount of interaction with the real system, do not yield any performance guarantees, and do not make good use of extensive insights from model-based control. In particular, common black-box approaches -- that abandon all insight from control -- are not suitable for complex robot systems. We propose a deep control approach as a bridge between the solid theoretical foundations of energy-based control and the flexibility of deep learning. To accomplish this goal, we extend Deep Lagrangian Networks (DeLaN) to not only adhere to Lagrangian Mechanics but also ensure conservation of energy and passivity of the learned representation. This novel extension is embedded within generic model-based control laws to enable energy control of under-actuated systems. The resulting DeLaN for energy control (DeLaN 4EC) is the first model learning approach using generic function approximation that is capable of learning energy control. DeLaN 4EC exhibits excellent real-time control on the physical Furuta Pendulum and learns to swing-up the pendulum while the control law using system identification does not.},

We give conditions under which a virtual holonomic constraint is feasible, i.e, it can be made invariant by feedback, and it is stabilizable. We provide sufficient conditions under which the dynamics on the constraint manifold correspond to an Euler- Lagrange system.

In recent years, a variety of contact-implicit trajectory optimization algorithms have been developed that avoid the pitfalls of mode pre-specification by simultaneously optimizing state, input, and contact force trajectories. However, their reliance on first-order integrators leads to a linear tradeoff between optimization problem size and plan accuracy. To address this limitation, we propose a new family of trajectory optimization algorithms that leverage ideas from discrete variational mechanics to derive higher-order generalizations of the classic time-stepping method of Stewart and Trinkle. By using these dynamics formulations as constraints in direct trajectory optimization algorithms, it is possible to perform contact-implicit trajectory optimization with significantly higher accuracy. For concreteness, we derive a second-order method and evaluate it using several simulated rigid body systems including an underactuated biped and a quadruped.},

  abstract = {There are several distinct failure modes for overoptimization of systems on the basis of metrics. This occurs when a metric which can be used to improve a system is used to an extent that further optimization is ineffective or harmful, and is sometimes termed Goodhart's Law. This class of failure is often poorly understood, partly because terminology for discussing them is ambiguous, and partly because discussion using this ambiguous terminology ignores distinctions between different failure modes of this general type. This paper expands on an earlier discussion by Garrabrant, which notes there are "(at least) four different mechanisms" that relate to Goodhart's Law. This paper is intended to explore these mechanisms further, and specify more clearly how they occur. This discussion should be helpful in better understanding these types of failures in economic regulation, in public policy, in machine learning, and in Artificial Intelligence alignment. The importance of Goodhart effects depends on the amount of power directed towards optimizing the proxy, and so the increased optimization power offered by artificial intelligence makes it especially critical for that field.},

  abstract = {A common belief in model-free reinforcement learning is that methods based on random search in the parameter space of policies exhibit significantly worse sample complexity than those that explore the space of actions. We dispel such beliefs by introducing a random search method for training static, linear policies for continuous control problems, matching state-of-the-art sample efficiency on the benchmark MuJoCo locomotion tasks. Our method also finds a nearly optimal controller for a challenging instance of the Linear Quadratic Regulator, a classical problem in control theory, when the dynamics are not known. Computationally, our random search algorithm is at least 15 times more efficient than the fastest competing model-free methods on these benchmarks. We take advantage of this computational efficiency to evaluate the performance of our method over hundreds of random seeds and many different hyperparameter configurations for each benchmark task. Our simulations highlight a high variability in performance in these benchmark tasks, suggesting that commonly used estimations of sample efficiency do not adequately evaluate the performance of RL algorithms.},

  abstract = {Learning sequential force interaction tasks from kinesthetic demonstrations is a promising approach to transfer human manipulation abilities to a robot. In this paper we propose a novel concept to decompose such demonstrations into a set of Movement Primitives (MPs). The decomposition is based on a probability distribution we call Directional Normal Distribution (DND). To capture the sequential properties of the manipulation task, we model the demonstrations with a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Here, we employ mixtures of DNDs as the HMM’s output emissions. The combination of HMMs and mixtures of DNDs allows to infer the MP’s composition, i.e., its coordinate frames, control variables and target coordinates from the demonstration data. In addition, it permits to determine an appropriate number of MPs that explains the demonstrations best. We evaluate the approach on kinesthetic demonstrations of a light bulb unscrewing task. Decomposing the task leads to intuitive and meaningful MPs that reflect the natural structure of the task.},

The movement primitive representation inherently supports multiple coordinate frames, enabling the system to generalize a skill to unseen object positions and orientations. In contrast to most other approaches, a skill is learned by solving a convex optimization problem Therefore, the quality of the skill does not depend on a good initial estimate of parameters. The resulting movements are automatically smooth and can be of arbitrary shape. The approach is evaluated and compared to other movement primitive representations on data from the Omniglot handwriting data set and on real demonstrations of a handwriting task. The evaluations show that the presented approach outperforms other state-of-the-art concepts in terms of generalization capabilities and accuracy.},

Typical industrial robots have a closed control architecture that accepts only velocity/position reference inputs, there are no joint torque sensors, and little or no information is available to the user on robot dynamics and on low-level joint controllers. Nonetheless, taking also advantage of the presence of a Force/Torque (F/T) sensor at the end-effector, a safe pHRI strategy based on kinematic information, on measurements from joint encoders and motor currents, and on end-effector forces/torques can be realized. An admittance control law has been implemented for collaboration in manual guidance mode, with whole-body collision detection in place both when the robot is in autonomous operation and when is simultaneously collaborating with a human. Several pHRI experiments validate the approach on a KUKA KR5 Sixx R650 robot equipped with an ATI F/T sensor.},

  abstract = {Passive elastic elements can contribute to stability, energetic efficiency, and impact absorption in both biological and robotic systems. They also add dynamical complexity which makes them more challenging to model and control. The impact of this added complexity to autonomous learning has not been thoroughly explored. This is especially relevant to tendon-driven limbs whose cables and tendons are inevitably elastic. Here, we explored the efficacy of autonomous learning and control on a simulated bio-plausible tendon-driven leg across different tendon stiffness values. We demonstrate that increasing stiffness of the simulated muscles can require more iterations for the inverse map to converge but can then perform more accurately, especially in discrete tasks. Moreover, the system is robust to subsequent changes in muscle stiffnesses and can adapt on-the-go within 5 attempts. Lastly, we test the system for the functional task of locomotion, and found similar effects of muscle stiffness to learning and performance. Given that a range of stiffness values led to improved learning and maximized performance, we conclude the robot bodies and autonomous controllers—at least for tendon-driven systems—can be co-developed to take advantage of elastic elements. Importantly, this opens also the door to development efforts that recapitulate the beneficial aspects of the co-evolution of brains and bodies in vertebrates.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement Learning (RL) of contact-rich manipulation tasks has yielded impressive results in recent years. While many studies in RL focus on varying the observation space or reward model, few efforts focused on the choice of action space (e.g. joint or end-effector space, position, velocity, etc.). However, studies in robot motion control indicate that choosing an action space that conforms to the characteristics of the task can simplify exploration and improve robustness to disturbances. This paper studies the effect of different action spaces in deep RL and advocates for variable impedance control in end-effector space (VICES) as an advantageous action space for constrained and contact-rich tasks. We evaluate multiple action spaces on three prototypical manipulation tasks: Path Following (task with no contact), Door Opening (task with kinematic constraints), and Surface Wiping (task with continuous contact). We show that VICES improves sample efficiency, maintains low energy consumption, and ensures safety across all three experimental setups. Further, RL policies learned with VICES can transfer across different robot models in simulation, and from simulation to real for the same robot.

  abstract = {This paper addresses fundamental limitations of feedback using information theoretic conservation laws and flux arguments. The paper has two parts. In the first part, we derive a conservation law dictating that causal feedback cannot reduce the differential entropy inserted in the loop by external sources. An interpretation of this result is that the total randomness induced by disturbances, as measured by differential entropy, cannot be reduced by causal feedback; it can only be re-allocated in time or in frequency (if well defined). Under asymptotic stationarity assumptions, this result has a spectral representation which constitutes an extension of Bode's inequality for arbitrary feedback. Our proofs make clear the role of causality, as well as how stability assumptions impact the final result. In the second part, we derive an inequality unveiling that the feedback loop must be able to convey information originating from two independent sources: 1) initial states of the physical plant; 2) exogenous disturbance signals. By using such principle, we construct a variety of information rate (information flux) inequalities. Furthermore, we derive a universal performance bound which is parameterized solely by the feedback capacity and the parameters of the plant. The latter is a new fundamental limitation, which is different from Bode's classical result, indicating that finite feedback capacity brings a new type of performance bound.},

Compliant motion may be produced either by a passive mechanical compliance built in to the manipulator, or by an active compliance implemented in the control servo loop. The second method, called force control, is the subject of this paper. In particular a theory of force control based on formal models of the manipulator and the task geometry is presented. The ideal effector is used to model the manipulator, the ideal surface is used to model the task geometry, and the goal trajectory is used to model the desired behavior of the manipulator. Models are also defined for position control and force control, providing a precise semantics for compliant motion primitives in manipulation programming languages. The formalism serves as a simple interface between the manipulator and the programmer, isolating the programmer from the fundamental complexity of low-level manipulator control. A method of automatically synthesizing a restricted class of manipulator programs based on the formal models of task and goal trajectory is also provided by the formalism.},

Crocoddyl efficiently computes the state trajectory and the control policy for a given predefined sequence of contacts. Its efficiency is due to the use of sparse analytical derivatives, exploitation of the problem structure, and data sharing. It employs differential geometry to properly describe the state of any geometrical system, e.g. floating-base systems. Additionally, we propose a novel optimal control algorithm called Feasibility-driven Differential Dynamic Programming (FDDP). Our method does not add extra decision variables which often increases the computation time per iteration due to factorization. FDDP shows a greater globalization strategy compared to classical Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) algorithms. Concretely, we propose two modifications to the classical DDP algorithm. First, the backward pass accepts infeasible state-control trajectories. Second, the rollout keeps the gaps open during the early "exploratory" iterations (as expected in multipleshooting methods with only equality constraints). We showcase the performance of our framework using different tasks. With our method, we can compute highly-dynamic maneuvers (e.g. jumping, front-flip) within few milliseconds.},

  abstract = {Physical cooperation with humans greatly enhances the capabilities of robotic systems when leaving standardized industrial settings. Our novel cognition-enabled control framework presented in this paper enables a robotic assistant to enrich its own experience by acquisition of human task knowledge during joint manipulation. Our robot incrementally learns semantic task structures during joint task execution using hierarchically clustered Hidden Markov Models. A semantic labeling of recognized task segments is acquired from the human partner through speech. After a small number of repetitions, the robot uses an anticipated task progress to generate a feed-forward set point for an admittance feedback control scheme. This paper describes the framework and its implementation on a mobile bi-manual platform. The evolution of the robot’s task knowledge is presented and discussed. Finally, the cooperation quality is measured in terms of the robot’s task contribution.},

In this paper we propose a risk-sensitive optimal feedback controller for physical assistance that autonomously adapts the robot’s behavior even during unknown situations. Using a probabilistic model to represent the cooperative task execution behavior and modeling the human as a source of process noise in the system, the proposed assistive controller proactively contributes to the task anticipating the human motion. Estimating online the current level of disagreement and prediction uncertainty, the assistive controller consequently calculates the optimal task contribution providing higher adaptability. A psychological evaluation compares different assistive control strategies in a virtual scenario using a two-Degree-ofFreedom haptic experimental setup. Results show that considering the current level of disagreement enhances the performance of the controller in terms of helpfulness and human effort minimization.},

Typically, most system identification approaches to pHRI model the human as a black box without prior assumptions about the underlying behavioral structure. However, integrating a priori knowledge about human behavior provides better prediction performance and it generalization capability. Thus, we present a novel method for human intention estimation using Gaussian Processes (GP) on an empirically supported human motor control model. In this article, the arm dynamics of a human is modeled as mechanical impedance which tracks a latent desired trajectory. We then adopt a Bayesian perspective by assuming GP priors on impedance parameters and the desired trajectory, which allows regression about the human motion intention from observed interaction forces. The proposed impedance-based GP model is validated in an experiment with human users to demonstrate its prediction performance.},

Among all robot control approaches for physical cooperation, goaloriented robotic assistance based on human behavior models has demonstrated superior performance in terms of human effort minimization. However, disagreements between robot expectations and human intentions render undesired internal wrenches producing discomfort and safety risks to the human. In this chapter we introduce an optimal control scheme adapting to both human behavior uncertainty and disagreements. First, we present a characterization of effective(motion-inducing) and internal(squeezing) force/torque components resulting from disagreements. Second, a risk-sensitive optimal control scheme anticipates human actions while adapting to both uncertainty and internal force/torque components. Results demonstrate superior performance in terms of both implicit and subjective measures in an experiment with human users.},

  abstract = {Objective: Modeling of human motor intention plays an essential role in predictively controlling a robotic system in human-robot interaction tasks. In most machine learning techniques, human motor behavior is modeled as a generic stochastic process. However, the integration of a priori knowledge about underlying system structures can provide insights on otherwise unobservable intrinsic states that yield superior prediction performance and increased generalization capabilities. Methods: We present a novel method for modeling human motor behavior that explicitly includes a neuroscientifically supported model of human motor control, in which the dynamics of the human arm are modeled by a mechanical impedance that tracks a latent desired trajectory. We adopt a Bayesian setting by defining Gaussian process (GP) priors for the impedance elements and the latent desired trajectory. This enables exploitation of a priori human arm impedance knowledge for regression of interaction forces through inference of a latent desired human trajectory. Results: The method is validated using simulated data, with particular focus on effects of GP prior parameterization and intention estimation capabilities. Superior prediction performance is shown with respect to a naive GP prior. An experiment with human participants evaluates generalization capabilities and effects of training data sparsity. Conclusion: We derive the correlations of an impedance-based GP model of human motor behavior that exploits a priori knowledge. Significance: The model effectively predicts interaction forces by inferring a latent desired human trajectory in previously observed as well as unobserved regions of the input space.},

  abstract = {Key challenges for the deployment of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in the real world are the discovery, representation and reuse of skills in the absence of a reward function. To this end, we propose a novel approach to learn a task-agnostic skill embedding space from unlabeled multi-view videos. Our method learns a general skill embedding independently from the task context by using an adversarial loss. We combine a metric learning loss, which utilizes temporal video coherence to learn a state representation, with an entropy regularized adversarial skill-transfer loss. The metric learning loss learns a disentangled representation by attracting simultaneous viewpoints of the same observations and repelling visually similar frames from temporal neighbors. The adversarial skill-transfer loss enhances re-usability of learned skill embeddings over multiple task domains. We show that the learned embedding enables training of continuous control policies to solve novel tasks that require the interpolation of previously seen skills. Our extensive evaluation with both simulation and real world data demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in learning transferable skills from unlabeled interaction videos and composing them for new tasks.

Numerous approaches to SEA impedance control have been developed under the premise that high-precision actuator torque control is a prerequisite. Indeed, the design of an inner torque compensator has a significant impact on actuator impedance rendering. The disturbance observer (DOB) based torque control implemented in NASA's Valkyrie robot is considered here and a mathematical model of this torque control, cascaded with an outer impedance compensator, is constructed. While previous work has examined the impact a disturbance observer has on torque control performance, little has been done regarding DOBs and impedance rendering accuracy. Both simulation and a series of experiments are used to demonstrate the significant improvements possible in an SEA's ability to render desired dynamic behaviors when utilizing a DOB. Actuator transparency at low impedances is improved, closed loop hysteresis is reduced, and the actuator's dynamic response to both commands and interaction torques more faithfully matches that of the desired model. All of this is achieved by leveraging DOB based control rather than increasing compensator gains, thus making improved SEA impedance control easier to achieve in practice.},

Sight-ed and congenitally blind subjects rated the roughness and distance spacing for a series of raised dot patterns. When judging roughness, intermediate dot spacings were perceived as being the most rough, while distance judgments generated a linear relation. Low-frequency rTMS applied to somatosensory cortex disrupted roughness without affecting distance judgments, while rTMS to occipital cortex disrupted distance but not roughness judgments. We also tested an early blind patient with bilateral occipital cortex damage. Her performance on the roughness determination task was normal; however, she was greatly impaired with distance judgments. The findings suggest a double-dissociation effect in which roughness and distance are primarily processed in somatosensory and occipital cortex, respectively. The differential effect of rTMS on task performance and corroborative clinical evidence suggest that occipital cortex is engaged in tactile tasks requiring fine spatial discrimination.},

To enable a robot to react appropriately to unforeseen effects, it is crucial that it continuously takes sensor feedback into account. While visual feedback is important for inferring a grasp pose and reaching for an object, contact feedback offers valuable information during manipulation and grasp acquisition. In this paper, we use model-free deep reinforcement learning to synthesize control policies that exploit contact sensing to generate robust grasping under uncertainty. We demonstrate our approach on a multi-fingered hand that exhibits more complex finger coordination than the commonly used two-fingered grippers. We conduct extensive experiments in order to assess the performance of the learned policies, with and without contact sensing. While it is possible to learn grasping policies without contact sensing, our results suggest that contact feedback allows for a significant improvement of grasping robustness under object pose uncertainty and for objects with a complex shape.},

However, for a robot and human to simultaneously manipulate an extended object is a difficult task using existing methods from the literature. Our approach in this paper is to use data from human-human dyad experiments to determine motion intent which we use for a physical human-robot co-manipulation task. We first present and analyze data from human-human dyads performing co-manipulation tasks. We show that our human-human dyad data has interesting trends including that interaction forces are non-negligible compared to the force required to accelerate an object and that the beginning of a lateral movement is characterized by distinct torque triggers from the leader of the dyad. We also examine different metrics to quantify performance of different dyads. We also develop a deep neural network based on motion data from human-human trials to predict human intent based on past motion. We then show how force and motion data can be used as a basis for robot control in a human-robot dyad. Finally, we compare the performance of two controllers for human-robot co-manipulation to human-human dyad performance.},

A destabilizing velocity-dependent force field (VF) was introduced for sets of three consecutive trials. Between sets a random number of 4–8 null field trials were interposed, where the VF was inactivated. This prevented subjects from learning the novel dynamics, making it possible to repeatedly recreate the initial adaptive response. We were able to investigate detailed changes in neural control between the first, second and third VF trials. We identified two feedforward control mechanisms, which were initiated on the second VF trial and resulted in a 50\% reduction in the hand path error. Responses to disturbances encountered on the first VF trial were feedback in nature, i.e. reflexes and voluntary correction of errors. However, on the second VF trial, muscle activation patterns were modified in anticipation of the effects of the force field. Feedforward cocontraction of all muscles was used to increase the viscoelastic impedance of the arm. While stiffening the arm, subjects also exerted a lateral force to counteract the perturbing effect of the force field. These anticipatory actions indicate that the central nervous system responds rapidly to counteract hitherto unfamiliar disturbances by a combination of increased viscoelastic impedance and formation of a crude internal dynamics model.},

  abstract = {Modern, torque-controlled service robots can regulate contact forces when interacting with their environment. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a powerful method to solve the underlying control problem, allowing to plan for wholebody motions while including different constraints imposed by the robot dynamics or its environment. However, an accurate model of the robot-environment is needed to achieve a satisfying closed-loop performance. Currently, this necessity undermines the performance and generality of MPC in manipulation tasks. In this work, we combine an MPC-based whole-body controller with two adaptive schemes, derived from online system identification and adaptive control. As a result, we enable a general mobile manipulator to interact with unknown environments, without any need for re-tuning parameters or pre-modeling the interacting objects. In combination with the MPC controller, the two adaptive approaches are validated and benchmarked with a ball-balancing manipulator in door opening and object lifting tasks.},

  abstract = {Series elastic actuation in rehabilitation robotics was introduced to elastically decouple the actuator from the joint in order to improve safety and guarantee a compliant actuator behaviour. Classical control approaches of series elastic actuation usually consist of a number of cascaded control structures, where the force or torque control problem is rearranged to a translational or rotational displacement control problem. Considering the parameter tuning of PID-type cascaded control-loops, passivity of the patient-actuator interaction dynamics should be of concern and imposes parameter bounds for the controller. In order to overcome these limitations, guarantee robust stability, minimise load impedance and reduce the complexity of the classical cascaded control structure, a new control strategy is presented in this paper. The controlled plant is down-squared to yield a positive real system and augmented with frequency dependent weightings to shape the sensitivity functions. Consequently, a new ℋ2-optimal controller is designed using an additional constraint to guarantee the strict positive realness of the controller. The resulting controller is obtained by solving a LMI-system, which is of a new form for the proposed loop-shaping procedure. Additionally, orthogonality constraints of the ℋ2-problem are relaxed in the new procedure by a loop-shifting approach. The resulting controller inherently guarantees the patient-actuator interaction transfer function to be positive real, minimises the load impedance and robustly stabilises the actuator due to the dissipative controller properties.},

  abstract = {Traditional approaches to quadruped control frequently employ simplified, hand-derived models. This significantly reduces the capability of the robot since its effective kinematic range is curtailed. In addition, kinodynamic constraints are often non-differentiable and difficult to implement in an optimisation approach. In this work, these challenges are addressed by framing quadruped control as optimisation in a structured latent space. A deep generative model captures a statistical representation of feasible joint configurations, whilst complex dynamic and terminal constraints are expressed via high-level, semantic indicators and represented by learned classifiers operating upon the latent space. As a consequence, complex constraints are rendered differentiable and evaluated an order of magnitude faster than analytical approaches. We validate the feasibility of locomotion trajectories optimised using our approach both in simulation and on a real-world ANYmal quadruped. Our results demonstrate that this approach is capable of generating smooth and realisable trajectories. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time latent space control has been successfully applied to a complex, real robot platform.},

  abstract = {Muscle models and animal observations suggest that physical damping is beneficial for stabilization. Still, only a few implementations of mechanical damping exist in compliant robotic legged locomotion. It remains unclear how physical damping can be exploited for locomotion tasks, while its advantages as sensor-free, adaptive force- and negative work-producing actuators are promising. In a simplified numerical leg model, we studied the energy dissipation from viscous and Coulomb damping during vertical drops with ground-level perturbations. A parallel spring-damper is engaged between touch-down and mid-stance, and its damper auto-disengages during mid-stance and takeoff. Our simulations indicate that an adjustable and viscous damper is desired. In hardware we explored effective viscous damping and adjustability and quantified the dissipated energy. We tested two mechanical, leg-mounted damping mechanisms; a commercial hydraulic damper, and a custom-made pneumatic damper. The pneumatic damper exploits a rolling diaphragm with an adjustable orifice, minimizing Coulomb damping effects while permitting adjustable resistance. Experimental results show that the leg-mounted, hydraulic damper exhibits the most effective viscous damping. Adjusting the orifice setting did not result in substantial changes of dissipated energy per drop, unlike adjusting damping parameters in the numerical model. Consequently, we also emphasize the importance of characterizing physical dampers during real legged impacts to evaluate their effectiveness for compliant legged locomotion.},

  abstract = {In environments with uncertain dynamics exploration is necessary to learn how to perform well. Existing reinforcement learning algorithms provide strong exploration guarantees, but they tend to rely on an ergodicity assumption. The essence of ergodicity is that any state is eventually reachable from any other state by following a suitable policy. This assumption allows for exploration algorithms that operate by simply favoring states that have rarely been visited before. For most physical systems this assumption is impractical as the systems would break before any reasonable exploration has taken place, i.e., most physical systems don't satisfy the ergodicity assumption. In this paper we address the need for safe exploration methods in Markov decision processes. We first propose a general formulation of safety through ergodicity. We show that imposing safety by restricting attention to the resulting set of guaranteed safe policies is NP-hard. We then present an efficient algorithm for guaranteed safe, but potentially suboptimal, exploration. At the core is an optimization formulation in which the constraints restrict attention to a subset of the guaranteed safe policies and the objective favors exploration policies. Our framework is compatible with the majority of previously proposed exploration methods, which rely on an exploration bonus. Our experiments, which include a Martian terrain exploration problem, show that our method is able to explore better than classical exploration methods.},

A graphical user interface (GUI) allows then the user to iteratively correct the acquired knowledge by refining high-level plans, and low-level geometrical knowledge of the task. This combination leads to a faster programming phase, more precise than just demonstrations, and more intuitive than just through a GUI. A final process allows to reuse high-level task knowledge for similar tasks in a transfer learning fashion. Finally we present a user study illustrating the advantages of this approach.},

  abstract = {Recent research into large-scale system stability has proceeded via two apparently unrelated approaches. For Lyapunov stability, it is assumed that the system can be broken down into a number of subsystems, and that for each subsystem one can find a Lyapunov function (or something akin to a Lyapunov function). The alternative approach is an input-output approach; stability criteria are derived by assuming that each subsystem has finite gain. The input-output method has also been applied to interconnections of passive and of conic subsystems. This paper attempts to unify many of the previous results, by studying linear interconnections of so-called "dissipative" subsystems. A single matrix condition is given which ensures both input-output stability and Lyapunov stability. The result is then specialized to cover interconnections of some special types of dissipative systems, namely finite gain systems, passive systems, and conic systems.},

Actually, the contribution of body morphology to cognition and control is rarely computational, in any useful sense of the word. We thus distinguish (1) morphology that facilitates control, (2) morphology that facilitates perception, and the rare cases of (3) morphological computation proper, such as reservoir computing, where the body is actually used for computation. This result contributes to the understanding of the relation between embodiment and computation: The question for robot design and cognitive science is not whether computation is offloaded to the body, but to what extent the body facilitates cognition and control—how it contributes to the overall orchestration of intelligent behavior.},

  abstract = {Learning robot control policies from physics simulations is of great interest to the robotics community as it may render the learning process faster, cheaper, and safer by alleviating the need for expensive real-world experiments. However, the direct transfer of learned behavior from simulation to reality is a major challenge. Optimizing a policy on a slightly faulty simulator can easily lead to the maximization of the 'Simulation Optimization Bias' (SOB). In this case, the optimizer exploits modeling errors of the simulator such that the resulting behavior can potentially damage the robot. We tackle this challenge by applying domain randomization, i.e., randomizing the parameters of the physics simulations during learning. We propose an algorithm called Simulation-based Policy Optimization with Transferability Assessment (SPOTA) which uses an estimator of the SOB to formulate a stopping criterion for training. The introduced estimator quantifies the over-fitting to the set of domains experienced while training. Our experimental results in two different environments show that the new simulation-based policy search algorithm is able to learn a control policy exclusively from a randomized simulator, which can be applied directly to real system without any additional training on the latter.},

  abstract = {Dexterous multi-fingered hands can provide robots with the ability to flexibly perform a wide range of manipulation skills. However, many of the more complex behaviors are also notoriously difficult to control: Performing in-hand object manipulation, executing finger gaits to move objects, and exhibiting precise fine motor skills such as writing, all require finely balancing contact forces, breaking and reestablishing contacts repeatedly, and maintaining control of unactuated objects. Learning-based techniques provide the appealing possibility of acquiring these skills directly from data, but current learning approaches either require large amounts of data and produce task-specific policies, or they have not yet been shown to scale up to more complex and realistic tasks requiring fine motor skills. In this work, we demonstrate that our method of online planning with deep dynamics models (PDDM) addresses both of these limitations; we show that improvements in learned dynamics models, together with improvements in online model-predictive control, can indeed enable efficient and effective learning of flexible contact-rich dexterous manipulation skills -- and that too, on a 24-DoF anthropomorphic hand in the real world, using just 4 hours of purely real-world data to learn to simultaneously coordinate multiple free-floating objects.

However, these proposed optimal control models are risk-neutral; that is, they are indifferent to the variability of the movement cost. Here, we propose the use of a risk-sensitive optimal controller that incorporates movement cost variance either as an added cost (risk-averse controller) or as an added value (risk-seeking controller) to model human motor behavior in the face of uncertainty. We use a sensorimotor task to test the hypothesis that subjects are risk-sensitive. Subjects controlled a virtual ball undergoing Brownian motion towards a target. Subjects were required to minimize an explicit cost, in points, that was a combination of the final positional error of the ball and the integrated control cost. By testing subjects on different levels of Brownian motion noise and relative weighting of the position and control cost, we could distinguish between risk-sensitive and risk-neutral control. We show that subjects change their movement strategy pessimistically in the face of increased uncertainty in accord with the predictions of a risk-averse optimal controller. Our results suggest that risk-sensitivity is a fundamental attribute that needs to be incorporated into optimal feedback control models.},

Many tasks are natural to specify with a sparse reward, and manually shaping a reward function can result in suboptimal performance. However, finding a non-zero reward is exponentially more difficult with increasing task horizon or action dimensionality. This puts many real-world tasks out of practical reach of RL methods. In this work, we use demonstrations to overcome the exploration problem and successfully learn to perform long-horizon, multi-step robotics tasks with continuous control such as stacking blocks with a robot arm. Our method, which builds on top of Deep Deterministic Policy Gradients and Hindsight Experience Replay, provides an order of magnitude of speedup over RL on simulated robotics tasks. It is simple to implement and makes only the additional assumption that we can collect a small set of demonstrations. Furthermore, our method is able to solve tasks not solvable by either RL or behavior cloning alone, and often ends up outperforming the demonstrator policy.},

A range of algorithms for finding parameterized policies that optimize for long-term average performance have been proposed in the past. However, the majority of the proposed approaches does not explicitly take into account the variability of the performance metric, which may lead to finding policies that although performing well on average, can perform spectacularly bad in a particular run or over a period of time. To address this shortcoming, we study an approach to policy optimization that explicitly takes into account higher order statistics of the reward function. In this paper, we extend policy gradient methods to include the entropic risk measure in the objective function and evaluate their performance in simulation experiments and on a realrobot task of learning a hitting motion in robot badminton.},

  abstract = {Rehabilitation robots have become important tools in stroke rehabilitation. Compared to manual arm training, robot-supported training can be more intensive, of longer duration and more repetitive. Therefore, robots have the potential to improve the rehabilitation process in stroke patients. Whereas a majority of previous work in upper limb rehabilitation robotics has focused on end-effector-based robots, a shift towards exoskeleton robots is taking place because they offer a better guidance of the human arm, especially for movements with a large range of motion. However, the implementation of an exoskeleton device introduces the challenge of reproducing the motion of the human shoulder, which is one of the most complex joints of the body. Thus, this paper starts with describing a simplified model of the human shoulder. On the basis of that model, a new ergonomic shoulder actuation principle that provides motion of the humerus head is proposed, and its implementation in the ARMin III arm therapy robot is described. The focus lies on the mechanics and actuation principle. The ARMin III robot provides three actuated degrees of freedom for the shoulder and one for the elbow joint. An additional module provides actuated lower arm pro/supination and wrist flexion/extension. Five ARMin III devices have been manufactured and they are currently undergoing clinical evaluation in hospitals in Switzerland and in the United States.},

In particular, this phenomenon impacts the sustainability indicators of worker health and safety and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Effective MSD prevention measures would therefore constitute a remarkable contribution to social and economic sustainability. This chapter provides first an outline of existing methods to prevent MSD at the workplace. Analysis of the approaches yields that effective solutions require earmarked finances as well as qualified personnel, both of which are not affordable for many companies. In pursuit of solutions, Human-centred Automation (HCA), a recent paradigm in manufacturing, proposes the design of manufacturing systems using intelligent technology to support the worker instead of replacing him/her. HCA has the unique potential of reducing the effort needed to implement MSD prevention strategies by simplifying the path to social and economic sustainability. This chapter demonstrates this process with the example of the “Working Posture Controller” (WPC), which illustrates how the HCA concept can be applied. Finally, the lessons learned from the case are outlined, providing a vision of how future workplaces can benefit from HCA.},

We integrate the Bounded-Memory Adaptation Model into a probabilistic decision process, enabling the robot to guide adaptable participants towards a better way of completing the task. Human subject experiments suggest that the proposed formalism improves the effectiveness of human-robot teams in collaborative tasks, when compared with one-way adaptations of the robot to the human, while maintaining the human?s trust in the robot.},

In order for the robots to engage in physical collaboration with humans, it is necessary to understand this coordination process. Unfortunately, there is no intrinsic way to define the interaction forces. In this study, we propose a model that allows us to compute the interaction force during a dyadic cooperative object manipulation task. The model is derived directly from the existing theories on human arm movements. The results of a user study with 22 human subjects prove the validity of the proposed model. The model is then embedded in a control strategy that enables the robot to engage in a cooperative task with a human. The performance evaluation of the controller through simulation shows that the control strategy is a promising candidate for a cooperative human-robot interaction.},

  abstract = {The two contrasting theoretical approaches to visual perception, the constructivist and the ecological, are briefly presented and illustrated through their analyses of space and size perception. Earlier calls for their reconciliation and unification are reviewed. Neurophysiological, neuropsychological, and psychophysical evidence for the existence of two quite distinct visual systems, the ventral and the dorsal, is presented. These two perceptual systems differ in their functions; the ventral system’s central function is that of identification, while the dorsal system is mainly engaged in the visual control of motor behavior. The strong parallels between the ecological approach and the functioning of the dorsal system, and between the constructivist approach and the functioning of the ventral system are noted. It is also shown that the experimental paradigms used by the proponents of these two approaches match the functions of the respective visual systems. A dual-process approach to visual perception emerges from this analysis, with the ecological-dorsal process transpiring mainly without conscious awareness, while the constructivist-ventral process is normally conscious. Some implications of this dual-process approach to visual-perceptual phenomena are presented, with emphasis on space perception.},

Very few works deal with the problem of moving parts in industrial assembly applications. However, having autonomous robots that are able to execute assembly tasks in dynamic environments could lead to more flexible facilities with reduced implementation efforts for individual products. In this paper, we present a general approach towards autonomous robotic assembly that combines visual and intrinsic tactile sensing to continuously track parts within a single Bayesian framework. Based on this, it is possible to implement object-centric assembly skills that are guided by the estimated poses of the parts, including cases where occlusions block the vision system. In particular, we investigate the application of this approach for peg-in-hole assembly. A tilt-and-align strategy is implemented using a Cartesian impedance controller, and combined with an adaptive path executor. Experimental results with multiple part combinations are provided and analyzed in detail.},

Typical examples are the determination of a time-minimal path in vehicle dynamics, a minimal energy trajectory in space mission design, or optimal motion sequences in robotics and biomechanics. In most cases, some sort of discretization of the original, infinite-dimensional optimization problem has to be performed in order to make the problem amenable to computations. The approach proposed in this paper is to directly discretize the variational description of the system’s motion. The resulting optimization algorithm lets the discrete solution directly inherit characteristic structural properties from the continuous one like symmetries and integrals of the motion. We show that the DMOC (Discrete Mechanics and Optimal Control) approach is equivalent to a finite difference discretization of Hamilton’s equations by a symplectic partitioned Runge-Kutta scheme and employ this fact in order to give a proof of convergence. The numerical performance of DMOC and its relationship to other existing optimal control methods are investigated.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a safe learning framework that employs an adaptive model learning method together with barrier certificates for systems with possibly nonstationary agent dynamics. To extract the dynamic structure of the model, we use a sparse optimization technique, and the resulting model will be used in combination with control barrier certificates which constrain policies (feedback controllers) in order to maintain safety, which refers to avoiding certain regions of the state space. Under certain conditions, recovery of safety in the sense of Lyapunov stability after violations of safety due to the nonstationarity is guaranteed. In addition, we reformulate action-value function approximation to make any kernel-based nonlinear function estimation method applicable to our adaptive learning framework. Lastly, solutions to the barrier-certified policy optimization are guaranteed to be globally optimal, ensuring greedy policy updates under mild conditions. The resulting framework is validated via simulations of a quadrotor, which has been used in the safe learnings literature under \{\textbackslash em stationarity\} assumption, and then tested on a real robot called \{\textbackslash em brushbot\}, whose dynamics is unknown, highly complex, and most probably nonstationary.},

In this work, we propose a universal unsupervised learning approach to extract useful representations from high-dimensional data, which we call Contrastive Predictive Coding. The key insight of our model is to learn such representations by predicting the future in latent space by using powerful autoregressive models. We use a probabilistic contrastive loss which induces the latent space to capture information that is maximally useful to predict future samples. It also makes the model tractable by using negative sampling. While most prior work has focused on evaluating representations for a particular modality, we demonstrate that our approach is able to learn useful representations achieving strong performance on four distinct domains: speech, images, text and reinforcement learning in 3D environments.},

  abstract = {Passivity-based control (PBC) is a well-established technique that has shown to be very powerful to design robust controllers for physical systems described by Euler–Lagrange (EL) equations of motion. For regulation problems of mechanical systems, which can be stabilized “shaping” only the potential energy, PBC preserves the EL structure and furthermore assigns a closed-loop energy function equal to the difference between the energy of the system and the energy supplied by the controller. Thus, we say that stabilization is achieved via energy balancing. Unfortunately, these nice properties of EL–PBC are lost when used in other applications which require shaping of the total energy, for instance, in electrical or electromechanical systems, or even some underactuated mechanical devices. Our main objective in this paper is to develop a new PBC theory which extends to a broader class of systems the aforementioned energy-balancing stabilization mechanism and the structure invariance. Towards this end, we depart from the EL description of the systems and consider instead port-controlled Hamiltonian models, which result from the network modelling of energy-conserving lumped-parameter physical systems with independent storage elements, and strictly contain the class of EL models.},

  abstract = {Perfectly rational decision-makers maximize expected utility, but crucially ignore the resource costs incurred when determining optimal actions. Here we propose an information-theoretic formalization of bounded rational decision-making where decision-makers trade off expected utility and information processing costs. Such bounded rational decision-makers can be thought of as thermodynamic machines that undergo physical state changes when they compute. Their behavior is governed by a free energy functional that trades off changes in internal energy-as a proxy for utility-and entropic changes representing computational costs induced by changing states. As a result, the bounded rational decision-making problem can be rephrased in terms of well-known concepts from statistical physics. In the limit when computational costs are ignored, the maximum expected utility principle is recovered. We discuss the relation to satisficing decision-making procedures as well as links to existing theoretical frameworks and human decision-making experiments that describe deviations from expected utility theory. Since most of the mathematical machinery can be borrowed from statistical physics, the main contribution is to axiomatically derive and interpret the thermodynamic free energy as a model of bounded rational decision-making.},

  abstract = {Mutual information maximization has emerged as a powerful learning objective for unsupervised representation learning obtaining state-of-the-art performance in applications such as object recognition, speech recognition, and reinforcement learning. However, such approaches are fundamentally limited since a tight lower bound of mutual information requires sample size exponential in the mutual information. This limits the applicability of these approaches for prediction tasks with high mutual information, such as in video understanding or reinforcement learning. In these settings, such techniques are prone to overfit, both in theory and in practice, and capture only a few of the relevant factors of variation. This leads to incomplete representations that are not optimal for downstream tasks. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that mutual information-based representation learning approaches do fail to learn complete representations on a number of designed and real-world tasks. To mitigate these problems we introduce the Wasserstein dependency measure, which learns more complete representations by using the Wasserstein distance instead of the KL divergence in the mutual information estimator. We show that a practical approximation to this theoretically motivated solution, constructed using Lipschitz constraint techniques from the GAN literature, achieves substantially improved results on tasks where incomplete representations are a major challenge.},

  abstract = {Our goal is to develop a principled and general algorithmic framework for task-driven estimation and control for robotic systems. State-of-the-art approaches for controlling robotic systems typically rely heavily on accurately estimating the full state of the robot (e.g., a running robot might estimate joint angles and velocities, torso state, and position relative to a goal). However, full state representations are often excessively rich for the specific task at hand and can lead to significant computational inefficiency and brittleness to errors in state estimation. In contrast, we present an approach that eschews such rich representations and seeks to create task-driven representations. The key technical insight is to leverage the theory of information bottlenecks\vphantom\{\}to formalize the notion of a "task-driven representation" in terms of information theoretic quantities that measure the minimality of a representation. We propose novel iterative algorithms for automatically synthesizing (offline) a task-driven representation (given in terms of a set of task-relevant variables (TRVs)) and a performant control policy that is a function of the TRVs. We present online algorithms for estimating the TRVs in order to apply the control policy. We demonstrate that our approach results in significant robustness to unmodeled measurement uncertainty both theoretically and via thorough simulation experiments including a spring-loaded inverted pendulum running to a goal location.},

  abstract = {This paper discusses the actuator-level control of Valkyrie, a new humanoid robot designed by NASA's Johnson Space Center in collaboration with several external partners. Several topics pertaining to Valkyrie's series elastic actuators are presented including control architecture, controller design, and implementation in hardware. A decentralized approach is taken in controlling Valkyrie's many series elastic degrees of freedom. By conceptually decoupling actuator dynamics from robot limb dynamics, the problem of controlling a highly complex system is simplified and the controller development process is streamlined compared to other approaches. This hierarchical control abstraction is realized by leveraging disturbance observers in the robot's joint-level torque controllers. A novel analysis technique is applied to understand the ability of a disturbance observer to attenuate the effects of unmodeled dynamics. The performance of this control approach is demonstrated in two ways. First, torque tracking performance of a single Valkyrie actuator is characterized in terms of controllable torque resolution, tracking error, bandwidth, and power consumption. Second, tests are performed on Valkyrie's arm, a serial chain of actuators, to demonstrate the robot's ability to accurately track torques with the presented decentralized control approach.},

  abstract = {The rise of collaborative robotics has offered new opportunities for integrating automation into the factories, allowing robots and humans to work side-by-side. However, this close physical coexistence inevitably brings new constraints for ensuring safe human-robot cooperation. The current paramount challenge is integrating human safety constraints without compromising the robotic performance goals, which require minimization of the task execution time alongside ensuring its accomplishment. This paper proposes a novel robot trajectory planning algorithm to produce minimumtime yet safe motion plans along specified paths in shared workspaces with humans. To this end, a safety module was used to evaluate the safety of a time-optimal trajectory iteratively. A safe replanning module was developed to optimally adapt the generated trajectory online whenever the optimal plan violates dynamically provided safety limits. In order to preserve performance, a recovery trajectory planning algorithm was included such that the robot is allowed to restore higher speed motions as soon as the safety concern has been resolved. The proposed solution’s effectiveness was evaluated both in simulations and real experiments with two robotic manipulators.},

In particular, the problems that are considered in this paper are related to the modeling, identification, and control of tendons sliding on curved pathways, subject to friction and viscoelastic effects. Tendons made in polymeric materials are considered, and therefore, hysteresis in the transmission system characteristic must be taken into account as an additional nonlinear effect because of the plasticity and creep phenomena typical of these materials. With the aim of reproducing these behaviors, a viscoelastic model is used to model the tendon compliance. Particular attention has been given to the friction effects arising from the interaction between the tendon pathway and the tendon itself. This phenomenon has been characterized by means of a LuGre-like dynamic friction model to consider the effects that cannot be reproduced by employing a static friction model. A specific setup able to measure the tendon's tension in different points along its path has been designed in order to verify the tension distribution and identify the proper parameters. Finally, a simple control strategy for the compensation of these nonlinear effects and the control of the force that is applied by the tendon to the load is proposed and experimentally verified.},

Problems with H2 and H∞ cost are considered and the resulting bilinear matrix inequality problems are solved using local, iterative algorithms. The procedure is applied to the synthesis of passive suspensions for the optimization of certain performance measures for a quarter-car model. The characterization of the positive real constraint using matrix inequalities and the use of a new mechanical element called the inerter, permits the optimization over the entire class of positive real admittances and the realization of the resulting admittance using passive elements. The optimization results are compared with previous results obtained using optimization over fixed-structure admittances. The proposed method can reproduce the previous results and achieve better results in certain cases. Results of the experimental testing of a mechanical network involving an inerter are presented.},

  abstract = {Movement Primitives (MP) are a well-established approach for representing modular and re-usable robot movement generators. Many state-of-the-art robot learning successes are based MPs, due to their compact representation of the inherently continuous and high dimensional robot movements. A major goal in robot learning is to combine multiple MPs as building blocks in a modular control architecture to solve complex tasks. To this effect, a MP representation has to allow for blending between motions, adapting to altered task variables, and co-activating multiple MPs in parallel. We present a probabilistic formulation of the MP concept that maintains a distribution over trajectories. Our probabilistic approach allows for the derivation of new operations which are essential for implementing all aforementioned properties in one framework. In order to use such a trajectory distribution for robot movement control, we analytically derive a stochastic feedback controller which reproduces the given trajectory distribution. We evaluate and compare our approach to existing methods on several simulated as well as real robot scenarios.},

Our LSTM-VAE-based detector reports an anomaly when a reconstruction-based anomaly score is higher than a state-based threshold. For evaluations with 1555 robot-assisted feeding executions, including 12 representative types of anomalies, our detector had a higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.8710 than 5 other baseline detectors from the literature.

In this paper, we propose a general framework to achieve very contact-reactive motions for robotic grasping and manipulation. Associating stereotypical movements to particular tasks enables our system to use previous sensor experiences as a predictive model for subsequent task executions. We use dynamical systems, named Dynamic Movement Primitives (DMPs), to learn goal-directed behaviors from demonstration. We exploit their dynamic properties by coupling them with the measured and predicted sensor traces. This feedback loop allows for online adaptation of the movement plan. Our system can create a rich set of possible motions that account for external perturbations and perception uncertainty to generate truly robust behaviors. As an example, we present an application to grasping with the WAM robot arm.},

  abstract = {In this letter, we propose a method to improve the accuracy of trajectory optimization for dynamic robots with intermittent contact by using orthogonal collocation. Until recently, most trajectory optimization methods for systems with contacts employ mode-scheduling, which requires an a priori knowledge of the contact order and thus cannot produce complex or non-intuitive behaviors. Contact-implicit trajectory optimization methods offer a solution to this by allowing the optimization to make or break contacts as needed, but thus far have suffered from poor accuracy. Here, we combine methods from direct collocation using higher order orthogonal polynomials with contact-implicit optimization to generate trajectories with significantly improved accuracy. The key insight is to increase the order of the polynomial representation while maintaining the assumption that impact occurs over the duration of one finite element.},

  abstract = {Imitation learning has long been an approach to alleviate the tractability issues that arise in reinforcement learning. However, most literature makes several assumptions such as access to the expert's actions, availability of many expert demonstrations, and injection of task-specific domain knowledge into the learning process. We propose reinforced inverse dynamics modeling (RIDM), a method of combining reinforcement learning and imitation from observation (IfO) to perform imitation using a single expert demonstration, with no access to the expert's actions, and with little task-specific domain knowledge. Given only a single set of the expert's raw states, such as joint angles in a robot control task, at each time-step, we learn an inverse dynamics model to produce the necessary low-level actions, such as torques, to transition from one state to the next such that the reward from the environment is maximized. We demonstrate that RIDM outperforms other techniques when we apply the same constraints on the other methods on six domains of the MuJoCo simulator and for two different robot soccer tasks for two experts from the RoboCup 3D simulation league on the SimSpark simulator.},

  abstract = {Our human-robot collaboration research aims to improve the fluency and efficiency of interactions between humans and robots when executing a set of tasks in a shared workspace. During human-robot collaboration, a robot and a user must often complete a disjoint set of tasks that use an overlapping set of objects, without using the same object simultaneously. A key challenge is deciding what task the robot should perform next in order to facilitate fluent and efficient collaboration. Most prior work does so by first predicting the human’s intended goal, and then selecting actions given that goal. However, it is often difficult, and sometimes impossible, to infer the human’s exact goal in real time, and this serial predict-then-act method is not adaptive to changes in human goals. In this paper, we present a system for inferring a probability distribution over human goals, and producing assistance actions given that distribution in real time. The aim is to minimize the disruption caused by the nature of human-robot shared workspace. We extend recent work utilizing Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) for shared autonomy in order to provide assistance without knowing the exact goal. We evaluate our system in a study with 28 participants, and show that our POMDP model outperforms state of the art predict-then-act models by producing fewer human-robot collisions and less human idling time.},

  abstract = {Accurate rotation estimation is at the heart of robot perception tasks such as visual odometry and object pose estimation. Deep neural networks have provided a new way to perform these tasks, and the choice of rotation representation is an important part of network design. In this work, we present a novel symmetric matrix representation of the 3D rotation group, SO(3), with two important properties that make it particularly suitable for learned models: (1) it satisfies a smoothness property that improves convergence and generalization when regressing large rotation targets, and (2) it encodes a symmetric Bingham belief over the space of unit quaternions, permitting the training of uncertainty-aware models. We empirically validate the benefits of our formulation by training deep neural rotation regressors on two data modalities. First, we use synthetic point-cloud data to show that our representation leads to superior predictive accuracy over existing representations for arbitrary rotation targets. Second, we use image data collected onboard ground and aerial vehicles to demonstrate that our representation is amenable to an effective out-of-distribution (OOD) rejection technique that significantly improves the robustness of rotation estimates to unseen environmental effects and corrupted input images, without requiring the use of an explicit likelihood loss, stochastic sampling, or an auxiliary classifier. This capability is key for safety-critical applications where detecting novel inputs can prevent catastrophic failure of learned models.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel method that arbitrates the control between the human and the robot actors in a teaching-by-demonstration setting to form synergy between the two and facilitate effective skill synthesis on the robot. We employed the human-in-the-loop teaching paradigm to teleoperate and demonstrate a complex task execution to the robot in real-time. As the human guides the robot to perform the task, the robot obtains the skill online during the demonstration. To encode the robotic skill we employed Locally Weighted Regression that fits local models to specific state region of the task based on the human demonstration. If the robot is in the state region where no local models exist, the control over the robotic mechanism is given to the human to perform the teaching. When local models are gradually obtained in that region, the control is given to the robot so that the human can examine its performance already during the demonstration stage, and take actions accordingly. This enables a co-adaptation between the agents and contributes to a faster and more efficient teaching. As a proof-of-concept, we realised the proposed robot teaching system on a haptic robot with the task of generation of a desired vertical force on a horizontal plane with unknown stiffness properties.},

The method is primarily based on observing the patterns and consistency in the observed dataset. This is obtained through a demonstration setting that uses a motion capture system, a force sensor, and muscle activity measurements. The variables (position and force) in the collected dataset are then segmented and analysed for each axis of the observed task frame separately. While checking several conditions based on the consistency, value range, and magnitude of repeated observations, the appropriate controller (i.e., position or force) is delegated to each axis of the task frame. In the final stage, the method also checks for a correlation between variables and muscle activity patterns to determine the desired stiffness behaviour. The robot then uses the derived control strategies in autonomous operation through a hybrid force/impedance controller. To validate the proposed method, we performed experiments on real-life tasks involving physical interaction with the environment, where we considered surface wiping, material sawing, and drilling.},

When operating in unpredictable and unstructured environments, modulation of limb impedance is essential in terms of successful task execution, stability and safety. We developed a novel hand-held stiffness control interface that is controlled by the motion of the human finger. A teaching approach was then used to achieve autonomous robot operation. In the experiments, we analysed and solved two part-assembly tasks: sliding a bolt fitting inside a groove and driving a self-tapping screw into a material of unknown properties. We experimentally compared the proposed method to complementary robot learning methods and analysed the potential benefits of direct stiffness modulation in the force-feedback teleoperation.},

  abstract = {Many studies on human motor control have examined how humans move the arms. A well known phenomenon known as the Fitts' law describes the trade-off between the speed of motion and its accuracy. In robotics, many studies were performed, and different control methods were proposed, for robots working in well structured environments. Nevertheless, the cooperation between humans and robots remains a challenging task that is highly relevant for robots aiming to work together with humans in non-structured environments. In this paper we propose a novel method for on-line adaptation of robotic trajectories, where humans and robots are autonomous agents coupled through physical interaction, for example through manipulated object. Within the proposed framework, the robot adapts to the human motion through the sensory feedback by taking into account the Fitts' law where the user specific behavior is estimated using a recursive least square updates. The movement trajectories are represented by the Dynamic Movement Primitives, where the adaptation relies on the Iterative Learning Controller framework. The proposed approach was evaluated by a cooperative human robot arm-reaching task on a plane. We tested the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method, showed its relevance and demonstrated that the proposed approach fully adapts to the human motor control and maintains the desired accuracy of the movement.},

The arm level uses nonlinear end-point feedback to control tip forces and positions. The object level manages the object via object impedance control. The task level directs multistep tasks autonomously. Experiments are shown for each level, culminating with two-handed insertion of a long part into a deep hole},

The finite element method (FEM) is currently used to determine the stiffness of the flexure parallel mechanism (FPM) with specified dimensions and free shape. This paper presents the stiffness model based on the way the flexure members are connected together in serial or parallel combinations. The modeling allows one to formulate the functional relationship between stiffness and dimensions as well as the free shape of the FPM in the design process. For illustration, stiffness matrices of a double linear spring and a three degree-of-freedom (DOF) translational flexure parallel mechanism are established. The proposed analytical model is validated by FEM model and experiments.},

In two physical interaction tasks – robot hand guiding and sliding on surfaces with different and unknown stiffnesses – we show that CCS controllers outperform their classical counterparts in an essential way.},

  abstract = {In standard reinforcement learning, each new skill requires a manually-designed reward function, which takes considerable manual effort and engineering. Self-supervised goal setting has the potential to automate this process, enabling an agent to propose its own goals and acquire skills that achieve these goals. However, such methods typically rely on manually-designed goal distributions, or heuristics to force the agent to explore a wide range of states. We propose a formal exploration objective for goal-reaching policies that maximizes state coverage. We show that this objective is equivalent to maximizing the entropy of the goal distribution together with goal reaching performance, where goals correspond to entire states. We present an algorithm called Skew-Fit for learning such a maximum-entropy goal distribution, and show that under certain regularity conditions, our method converges to a uniform distribution over the set of possible states, even when we do not know this set beforehand. Skew-Fit enables self-supervised agents to autonomously choose and practice diverse goals. Our experiments show that it can learn a variety of manipulation tasks from images, including opening a door with a real robot, entirely from scratch and without any manually-designed reward function.},

  abstract = {Deep learning and reinforcement learning methods have recently been used to solve a variety of problems in continuous control domains. An obvious application of these techniques is dexterous manipulation tasks in robotics which are difficult to solve using traditional control theory or hand-engineered approaches. One example of such a task is to grasp an object and precisely stack it on another. Solving this difficult and practically relevant problem in the real world is an important long-term goal for the field of robotics. Here we take a step towards this goal by examining the problem in simulation and providing models and techniques aimed at solving it. We introduce two extensions to the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (DDPG), a model-free Q-learning based method, which make it significantly more data-efficient and scalable. Our results show that by making extensive use of off-policy data and replay, it is possible to find control policies that robustly grasp objects and stack them. Further, our results hint that it may soon be feasible to train successful stacking policies by collecting interactions on real robots.},

Most state-of-the-art techniques treat the discontinuous dynamics of contact as discrete modes and restrict the search for a complete path to a specified sequence through these modes. Here we present a novel method for trajectory planning through contact that eliminates the requirement for an a priori mode ordering. Motivated by the formulation of multi-contact dynamics as a Linear Complementarity Problem (LCP) for forward simulation, the proposed algorithm leverages Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP) to naturally resolve contact constraint forces while simultaneously optimizing a trajectory and satisfying nonlinear complementarity constraints. The method scales well to high dimensional systems with large numbers of possible modes. We demonstrate the approach using three increasingly complex systems: rotating a pinned object with a finger, planar walking with the Spring Flamingo robot, and high speed bipedal running on the FastRunner platform.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an investigation focused on cooperation of a small industrial robot and a human operator. During their cooperation the collision is expected only between the robot end-effector and the lower arm of the human worker. To ensure safe and comfortable human-robot interaction the impact must not cause any injury or considerable pain to the human operator. An investigation with human volunteers was performed, to study the impact between the robot and the man. To determine a safe range of the impact intensity with human subjects, a preliminary investigation was performed on one of the authors of this paper. During the experiment, the volunteers determined the pain they felt after each impact using a graphical user interface. In the experiments, the robot end-effector collided with the volunteer's lower arm perpendicularly at a constant deceleration. The point of impact was positioned midway between the wrist and the elbow on the dorsal aspect of the lower arm. The robot end-effector was displaced from the initial point toward the point of impact along a straight line. Several tests were carried out at maximal velocity, different robot decelerations, various end- effector shapes, and varying depth of stop point with regard to the arm surface. The impacts between robot end-effector and human arm were evaluated using a measuring system comprised of a force sensor and an optical measuring system. The goal of the investigation was to determine the correlation between the pain intensity felt during the impact and the impact energy density.},

  abstract = {Catastrophic forgetting continues to severely restrict the learnability of controllers suitable for multiple task environments. Efforts to combat catastrophic forgetting reported in the literature to date have focused on how control systems can be updated more rapidly, hastening their adjustment from good initial settings to new environments, or more circumspectly, suppressing their ability to overfit to any one environment. When using robots, the environment includes the robot's own body, its shape and material properties, and how its actuators and sensors are distributed along its mechanical structure. Here we demonstrate for the first time how one such design decision (sensor placement) can alter the landscape of the loss function itself, either expanding or shrinking the weight manifolds containing suitable controllers for each individual task, thus increasing or decreasing their probability of overlap across tasks, and thus reducing or inducing the potential for catastrophic forgetting.},

  abstract = {It is traditional to make the interface between an actuator and its load as stiff as possible. Despite this tradition, reducing interface stiffness offers a number of advantages, including greater shock tolerance, lower reflected inertia, more accurate and stable force control, less inadvertent damage to the environment, and the capacity for energy storage. As a trade-off, reducing interface stiffness also lowers zero motion force bandwidth. In this paper, the authors propose that for natural tasks, zero motion force bandwidth isn't everything, and incorporating series elasticity as a purposeful element within the actuator is a good idea. The authors use the term elasticity instead of compliance to indicate the presence of a passive mechanical spring in the actuator. After a discussion of the trade-offs inherent in series elastic actuators, the authors present a control system for their use under general force or impedance control. The authors conclude with test results from a revolute series-elastic actuator meant for the arms of the MIT humanoid robot Cog and for a small planetary rover},

An efficient and informative representation would facilitate the effectiveness and generalization of such algorithms. For this purpose, we present KETO, a framework of learning keypoint representations of tool-based manipulation. For each task, a set of task-specific keypoints is jointly predicted from 3D point clouds of the tool object by a deep neural network. These keypoints offer a concise and informative description of the object to determine grasps and subsequent manipulation actions. The model is learned from self-supervised robot interactions in the task environment without the need for explicit human annotations. We evaluate our framework in three manipulation tasks with tool use. Our model consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of task success rates. Qualitative results of keypoint prediction and tool generation are shown to visualize the learned representations.},

Unlike previous methods which study an independent and fully AI-equipped autonomous system, this paper explores the subtask distribution between a robot and a human and studies a human-in-the-loop robotic system for collaborative assembly. The system distributes the subtasks of an assembly to robots and humans by exploiting their advantages and avoiding their disadvantages. The robot in the system will work on pick-and-place tasks and provide workpieces to humans. The human collaborator will work on fine operations like aligning, fixing, screwing, etc. A constraint based incremental manipulation planning method is proposed to generate the motion for the robots. The performance of the proposed system is demonstrated by asking a human and the dual-arm robot to collaboratively assemble a cabinet. The results showed that the proposed system and planner are effective, efficient, and can assist humans in finishing the assembly task comfortably.},

  abstract = {PYROBOCOP is a lightweight Python-based package for control and optimization of robotic systems described by nonlinear Differential Algebraic Equations (DAEs). In particular, the package can handle systems with contacts that are described by complementarity constraints and provides a general framework for specifying obstacle avoidance constraints. The package performs direct transcription of the DAEs into a set of nonlinear equations by performing orthogonal collocation on finite elements. The resulting optimization problem belongs to the class of Mathematical Programs with Complementarity Constraints (MPCCs). MPCCs fail to satisfy commonly assumed constraint qualifications and require special handling of the complementarity constraints in order for NonLinear Program (NLP) solvers to solve them effectively. PYROBOCOP provides automatic reformulation of the complementarity constraints that enables NLP solvers to perform optimization of robotic systems. The package is interfaced with ADOL-C (Griewank et al. 1996) for obtaining sparse derivatives by automatic differentiation and IPOPT (Wa¨ chter and Biegler 2006) for performing optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in terms of speed and flexibility. We provide several numerical examples for several robotic systems with collision avoidance as well as contact constraints represented using complementarity constraints. We provide comparisons with other open source optimization packages like CasADi and Pyomo.},

The arm is intended for people with neuromuscular weakness due to muscular dystrophy or spinal muscular atrophy. Previous work determined that actuation in parallel with gravity balancing springs required less torque than actuation in series. Compliance is achieved by using a series elastic actuator (SEA) by placing torsional springs between the motors and the WREX. A torque control was implemented on the SEA at the joint level. The response of the control law was characterized without disturbances. The SEAs were then attached to the orthosis to test the response with disturbances, and the control provided accurate joint torques.},

  abstract = {Sequential decision making in the presence of uncertainty and stochastic dynamics gives rise to distributions over state/action trajectories in reinforcement learning (RL) and optimal control problems. This observation has led to a variety of connections between RL and inference in probabilistic graphical models (PGMs). Here we explore a different dimension to this relationship, examining reinforcement learning using the tools and abstractions of statistical physics. The central object in the statistical physics abstraction is the idea of a partition function \$\textbackslash mathcal\{Z\}\$, and here we construct a partition function from the ensemble of possible trajectories that an agent might take in a Markov decision process. Although value functions and \$Q\$-functions can be derived from this partition function and interpreted via average energies, the \$\textbackslash mathcal\{Z\}\$-function provides an object with its own Bellman equation that can form the basis of alternative dynamic programming approaches. Moreover, when the MDP dynamics are deterministic, the Bellman equation for \$\textbackslash mathcal\{Z\}\$ is linear, allowing direct solutions that are unavailable for the nonlinear equations associated with traditional value functions. The policies learned via these \$\textbackslash mathcal\{Z\}\$-based Bellman updates are tightly linked to Boltzmann-like policy parameterizations. In addition to sampling actions proportionally to the exponential of the expected cumulative reward as Boltzmann policies would, these policies take entropy into account favoring states from which many outcomes are possible.},

Given the number and diversity of existing methods, it is critical that comprehensive empirical studies be performed comparing the relative strengths of these learning techniques. In particular, we evaluate four different approaches based on properties an end user may desire for real-world tasks. To perform this evaluation, we collected data from nine participants, across four different manipulation tasks with varying starting conditions. The resulting demonstrations were used to train 180 task models and evaluated on 720 task reproductions on a physical robot. Our results detail how i) complexity of the task, ii) the expertise of the human demonstrator, and iii) the starting configuration of the robot affect task performance. The collected dataset of demonstrations, robot executions, and evaluations are being made publicly available. Research insights and guidelines are also provided to guide future research and deployment choices about these approaches.},

  abstract = {Abstract. We give a basic introduction to Gaussian Process regression models. We focus on understanding the role of the stochastic process and how it is used to define a distribution over functions. We present the simple equations for incorporating training data and examine how to learn the hyperparameters using the marginal likelihood. We explain the practical advantages of Gaussian Process and end with conclusions and a look at the current trends in GP work. Supervised learning in the form of regression (for continuous outputs) and classification (for discrete outputs) is an important constituent of statistics and machine learning, either for analysis of data sets, or as a subgoal of a more complex problem. Traditionally parametric 1 models have been used for this purpose. These have a possible advantage in ease of interpretability, but for complex data sets, simple parametric models may lack expressive power, and their more complex counterparts (such as feed forward neural networks) may not be easy to work with in practice. The advent of kernel machines, such as Support Vector Machines and Gaussian Processes has opened the possibility of flexible models which are practical to work with. In this short tutorial we present the basic idea on how Gaussian Process models can be used to formulate a Bayesian framework for regression. We will focus on understanding the stochastic process and how it is used in supervised learning. Secondly, we will discuss practical matters regarding the role of hyperparameters in the covariance function, the marginal likelihood and the automatic Occam’s razor. For broader introductions to Gaussian processes, consult [1], [2]. 1 Gaussian Processes In this section we define Gaussian Processes and show how they can very naturally be used to define distributions over functions. In the following section we continue to show how this distribution is updated in the light of training examples. 1 By a parametric model, we here mean a model which during training “absorbs ” the information from the training data into the parameters; after training the data can be discarded.},

I-POMDPs allow sequential decision making in multi-agent environments by modeling other agents’ beliefs, capabilities, and preferences as part of the interactive state space. Since beliefs are allowed to be arbitrarily nested and are continuous, it is not possible to compute optimal solutions using value iteration as in POMDPs. We present a method that transforms the original state space into a finite one by grouping the other agents’ behaviorally equivalent models into equivalence classes. This enables us to compute the complete optimal solution for the I-POMDP, which may be represented as a policy graph. We illustrate our method using the multi-agent Tiger problem and discuss features of the solution.},

  abstract = {In shared autonomy, user input is combined with semi-autonomous control to achieve a common goal. The goal is often unknown ex-ante, so prior work enables agents to infer the goal from user input and assist with the task. Such methods tend to assume some combination of knowledge of the dynamics of the environment, the user’s policy given their goal, and the set of possible goals the user might target, which limits their application to real-world scenarios. We propose a deep reinforcement learning framework for model-free shared autonomy that lifts these assumptions. We use human-in-the-loop reinforcement learning with neural network function approximation to learn an end-to-end mapping from environmental observation and user input to agent action values, with task reward as the only form of supervision. This approach poses the challenge of following user commands closely enough to provide the user with real-time action feedback and thereby ensure high-quality user input, but also deviating from the user’s actions when they are suboptimal. We balance these two needs by discarding actions whose values fall below some threshold, then selecting the remaining action closest to the user’s input. Controlled studies with users (n = 12) and synthetic pilots playing a video game, and a pilot study with users (n = 4) flying a real quadrotor, demonstrate the ability of our algorithm to assist users with real-time control tasks in which the agent cannot directly access the user’s private information through observations, but receives a reward signal and user input that both depend on the user’s intent. The agent learns to assist the user without access to this private information, implicitly inferring it from the user’s input. This enables the assisted user to complete the task more effectively than the user or an autonomous agent could on their own. This paper is a proof of concept that illustrates the potential for deep reinforcement learning to enable flexible and practical assistive systems.},

The user knows the rewards and unsafe states, but querying the user is expensive. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithm that safely and interactively learns a model of the user's reward function. We start with a generative model of initial states and a forward dynamics model trained on off-policy data. Our method uses these models to synthesize hypothetical behaviors, asks the user to label the behaviors with rewards, and trains a neural network to predict the rewards. The key idea is to actively synthesize the hypothetical behaviors from scratch by maximizing tractable proxies for the value of information, without interacting with the environment. We call this method reward query synthesis via trajectory optimization (ReQueST). We evaluate ReQueST with simulated users on a state-based 2D navigation task and the image-based Car Racing video game. The results show that ReQueST significantly outperforms prior methods in learning reward models that transfer to new environments with different initial state distributions. Moreover, ReQueST safely trains the reward model to detect unsafe states, and corrects reward hacking before deploying the agent.},

With this understanding of human haptic communication we attempted a "haptic Turing test," replicating human behaviors in a robot partner. Human participants consciously and incorrectly believed their partner was human. However, force profiles did not show specialization of roles in the human partner, nor enhanced dyadic performance, suggesting that haptic interaction holds a greater subconscious subtlety. We further report observations of a non-zero dyadic steady state force perhaps analogous to co-contraction within the limb of an individual, where it contributes to limb stiffness and disturbance rejection. We present results on disturbance rejection in a dyad, showing lack of an effective dyadic strategy for brief events.},

  abstract = {The robotic assembly represents a group of benchmark problems for reinforcement learning and variable compliance control that features sophisticated contact manipulation. One of the key challenges in applying reinforcement learning to physical robot is the sample complexity, the requirement of large amounts of experience for learning. We mitigate this sample complexity problem by incorporating an iteratively refitted model into the learning process through model-guided exploration. Yet, fitting a local model of the physical environment is of major difficulties. In this work, a Kalman filter is used to combine the adaptive linear dynamics with a coarse prior model from analytical description, and proves to give more accurate predictions than the existing method. Experimental results show that the proposed model fitting strategy can be incorporated into a model predictive controller to generate good exploration behaviors for learning acceleration, while preserving the benefits of model-free reinforcement learning for uncertain environments. In addition to the sample complexity, the inevitable robot overloaded during operation also tends to limit the learning efficiency. To address this problem, we present a method to restrict the largest possible potential energy in the compliance control system and therefore keep the contact force within the legitimate range.},

Manual guidance can achieve robot agility effectively, provided that a safe and smooth interaction is guaranteed when the user exerts an external force on the end effector. We approach this by designing an adaptive admittance law that can adjust its parameters to modify the robot compliance in critical areas of the workspace, such as near and on configuration singularities, joint limits, and workspace limits, for a smooth and safe operation. Experimental validation was done with two tests: a constraint activation test and a 3D shape tracing task. In the first one, we validate the proper response to constraints and in the second one, we compare the proposed approach with different admittance parameter tuning strategies using a drawing task where the user is asked to guide the robot to trace a 3D profile with an accuracy or speed directive and evaluate performance considering path length error and execution time as metrics, and a questionnaire for user perception. Results show that appropriate response to individual and simultaneous activation of the aforementioned constraints for a safe and intuitive manual guidance interaction is achieved and that the proposed parameter tuning strategy has better performance in terms of accuracy, execution time, and subjective evaluation of users.},

  abstract = {Robotic arms can perform grasping actions thanks to their “dexteorus” part, i.e. the gripper. Among the various categories, nowadays pneumatic grippers became the most employed in industry, as they have low cost and little bulkiness. Despite their simplicity, controlling the force applied by these grippers is not straightforward due to the dependence of such a force on the air pressure in the gripper chambers. As a result, it is still tricky to implement closed-loop force control for pneumatic grippers. This paper intends to deliver a control scheme relying on the force measurement to control pneumatic grippers. The force might be measured through a commercial sensor (e.g. a load cell) and fed back to close the control loop. This includes a calibration which maps the force-pressure relation taking into account both desired force and length of the gripper fingers. The control scheme exploits two different pressure regulators to precisely adjust the air pressure inside the gripper chambers (i.e. opening and closing chambers). To this aim, a quadratic programming algorithm is employed. The control scheme performance revealed to be good: results will be shown in terms of gripper response to sinusoidal and step inputs, along with the pressure-force characterization.},

  abstract = {Industry 4.0 is taking human-robot collaboration at the center of the production environment. Collaborative robots enhance productivity and flexibility while reducing human’s fatigue and the risk of injuries, exploiting advanced control methodologies. However, there is a lack of real-time model-based controllers accounting for the complex human-robot interaction dynamics. With this aim, this paper proposes a Model-Based Reinforcement Learning (MBRL) variable impedance controller to assist human operators in collaborative tasks. More in details, an ensemble of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) is used to learn a human-robot interaction dynamic model, capturing uncertainties. Such a learned model is kept updated during collaborative task execution. In addition, the learned model is used by a Model Predictive Controller (MPC) with Cross-Entropy Method (CEM). The aim of the MPC+CEM is to online optimize the stiffness and damping impedance control parameters minimizing the human effort (i.e., minimizing the human-robot interaction forces). The proposed approach has been validated through an experimental procedure. A lifting task has been considered as the reference validation application (weight of the manipulated part: 10 kg unknown to the robot controller). A KUKA LBR iiwa 14 R820 has been used as a test platform. Qualitative performance (i.e., questionnaire on perceived collaboration) have been evaluated. Achieved results have been compared with previously developed offline model-free optimized controllers and with the robot manual guidance controller. The proposed MBRL variable impedance controller shows improved human-robot collaboration.},

  abstract = {The presented paper proposes an analytical force overshoots free control architecture for standard industrial manipulators involved in high-accuracy industrial assembly tasks (i.e., with tight mounting tolerances). As in many industrial scenarios, the robot manipulates components through (compliant) external grippers and interacts with partially unknown compliant environments. In such a context, a force overshoot may result in task failures (e.g., gripper losses the component, component damages), representing a critical control issue. To face such problem, the proposed control architecture makes use of the force measurements as a feedback (obtained using a force/torque sensor at the robot end-effector) and of the estimation of the equivalent interacting elastic system stiffness (i.e., force sensor– compliant gripper–compliant environment equivalent stiffness) defining two control levels: (i) an internal impedance controller with inner position and orientation loop and (ii) an external impedance shaping force tracking controller. A theoretical analysis of the method has been performed. Then, the method has been experimentally validated in an industrial-like assembly task with tight mounting tolerances (i.e., H7/h6 mounting). A standard industrial robot (a Universal Robot UR 10 manipulator) has been used as a test-platform, equipped with an external force/torque sensor Robotiq FT 300 at the robot end-effector and with a Robotiq Adaptive Gripper C-Model to manipulate target components. ROS framework has been adopted to implement the proposed control architecture. Experimental results show the avoidance of force overshoots and the achieved target dynamic performance.},

  author = {Roveda, Loris},
  journaltitle = {Autonomous Robots},
  pages = {18},
  abstract = {Industrial robots are increasingly used to perform tasks requiring an interaction with the surrounding environment (e.g., assembly tasks). Such environments are usually (partially) unknown to the robot, requiring the implemented controllers to suitably react to the established interaction. Standard controllers require force/torque measurements to close the loop. However, most of the industrial manipulators do not have embedded force/torque sensor(s) and such integration results in additional costs and implementation effort. To extend the use of compliant controllers to sensorless interaction control, a model-based methodology is presented in this paper. Relying on sensorless Cartesian impedance control, two Extended Kalman Filters (EKF) are proposed: an EKF for interaction force estimation and an EKF for environment stiffness estimation. Exploiting such estimations, a control architecture is proposed to implement a sensorless force loop (exploiting the provided estimated force) with adaptive Cartesian impedance control and coupling dynamics compensation (exploiting the provided estimated environment stiffness). The described approach has been validated in both simulations and experiments. A Franka EMIKA panda robot has been used. A probing task involving different materials (i.e., with different - unknown - stiffness properties) has been considered to show the capabilities of the developed EKFs (able to converge with limited errors) and control tuning (preserving stability). Additionally, a polishing-like task and an assembly task have been implemented to show the achieved performance of the proposed methodology.},

The performance of the controlled system naturally depends on the control architecture and on the morphology of the robot. Because of this strong coupling, most of the impressive applications in morphological computation typically apply minimalistic control architectures. Ideally, adapting the morphology of the plant and optimizing the control law interact so that finally, optimal physical properties of the system and optimal control laws emerge. As a first step toward this vision, we apply optimal control methods for investigating the power of morphological computation. We use a probabilistic optimal control method to acquire control laws, given the current morphology. We show that by changing the morphology of our robot, control problems can be simplified, resulting in optimal controllers with reduced complexity and higher performance. This concept is evaluated on a compliant four-link model of a humanoid robot, which has to keep balance in the presence of external pushes.}

Formulation of a control objective in terms of information gain allows mobile sensors to be both autonomous and easily reconfigurable to include a variety of sensor and target models. Tracking a moving target using a camera mounted on a fixed-wing unmanned aircraft is considered, but the control formulation is not specific to this choice of sensor or estimation task. A control formulation is developed which minimizes the entropy of an estimate distribution over a receding horizon subject to stochastic non-linear models for both the target motion and sensors. Previous similar work has been restricted to either a stationary target, a horizon of length one, or Gaussian estimates. The prediction of conditional entropy is shown to be inherently complex, and a computationally efficient sequential Monte Carlo method is developed. The entropy prediction depends on this Monte Carlo method as well as a novel approach for entropy calculation in the context of particle filtering. These methods are verified through simulation and post-processing of experimental flight data.},

  abstract = {Learning from small data sets is critical in many practical applications where data collection is time consuming or expensive, e.g., robotics, animal experiments or drug design. Meta learning is one way to increase the data efficiency of learning algorithms by generalizing learned concepts from a set of training tasks to unseen, but related, tasks. Often, this relationship between tasks is hard coded or relies in some other way on human expertise. In this paper, we frame meta learning as a hierarchical latent variable model and infer the relationship between tasks automatically from data. We apply our framework in a model-based reinforcement learning setting and show that our meta-learning model effectively generalizes to novel tasks by identifying how new tasks relate to prior ones from minimal data. This results in up to a 60\% reduction in the average interaction time needed to solve tasks compared to strong baselines.},

  abstract = {Self-organized robots may develop attracting states within the sensorimotor loop, that is within the phase space of neural activity, body, and environmental variables. Fixpoints, limit cycles, and chaotic attractors correspond in this setting to a non-moving robot, to directed, and to irregular locomotion respectively. Short higher-order control commands may hence be used to kick the system from one self-organized attractor robustly into the basin of attraction of a different attractor, a concept termed here as kick control. The individual sensorimotor states serve in this context as highly compliant motor primitives. We study different implementations of kick control for the case of simulated and real-world wheeled robots, for which the dynamics of the distinct wheels is generated independently by local feedback loops. The feedback loops are mediated by rate-encoding neurons disposing exclusively of propriosensoric inputs in terms of projections of the actual rotational angle of the wheel. The changes of the neural activity are then transmitted into a rotational motion by a simulated transmission rod akin to the transmission rods used for steam locomotives. We find that the self-organized attractor landscape may be morphed both by higher-level control signals, in the spirit of kick control, and by interacting with the environment. Bumping against a wall destroys the limit cycle corresponding to forward motion, with the consequence that the dynamical variables are then attracted in phase space by the limit cycle corresponding to backward moving. The robot, which does not dispose of any distance or contact sensors, hence reverses direction autonomously.},

The force, strain and speed of response properties of dielectric elastomer material place it somewhere between those of piezoceramics and shape memory alloys. In this study, the use of a dielectric elastomer tubular actuator for adaptive vibration isolation, where an electromechanical model of the actuator is utilised as a part of the feedforward controller estimation scheme, is examined. Active vibration isolation, with time-varying loads, is considered using a feedforward adaptive control approach. In this approach, a black-box cancellation path model is generally used to ensure convergence of the filtered-x least mean squares estimated controller parameters. Here the feasibility of using a cancellation path model comprising of the physical-based electromechanical model of the combined dielectric elastomer actuator and its ‘sensitive’ load is investigated. The implementation presented involves auto-tuning a finite impulse response filter representation of the physical-based cancellation path model whenever a loading change in the system is detected. When the finite impulse response filter representation has been updated, the adaptive feedforward control automatically turns back on. Load sensing is required to supply a value of the time-varying load to the model.},

However, robotic assembly remains one of the most challenging problems in robotics research. In particular, it has to overcome uncertainty in the environment and the location of parts. This paper addresses how to estimate and correct part positioning uncertainties with respect to the assembly task by using the contact trajectory data collected during active part interaction. We first devise a nominal assembly motion sequence based on an approximate knowledge of the poses of the parts, which includes exploratory compliant moves for the purpose of parameter estimation. As the robot manipulator executes the nominal motion sequence, data collected during exploratory compliant moves are used to estimate part poses more accurately, and the improved information is used to update the subsequent assembly motion sequence to correct errors in the nominal plan. We implemented the strategy using a back-drivable Barrett WAM robotic arm without a force sensor and BarrettHand BH8-262. The empirical results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach.},

We derive sharp upper bounds for three separate regimes of eigenvalue distribution: stable, marginally stable, and explosive. Although the underlying process behaves quite differently in each of these three regimes, the systematic analysis of a self--normalized martingale difference term helps bound identification error up to logarithmic factors of the lower bound. For the general case when there is an arbitrary distribution of eigenvalues and the covariate process is a combination of the three regimes, our techniques recover the exact behavior of the identification error. On the other hand, we demonstrate that the least squares solution may be statistically inconsistent under certain conditions even when the signal-to-noise ratio is high.},

  abstract = {Background: Physical interactions between two people are ubiquitous in our daily lives, and an integral part of many forms of rehabilitation. However, few studies have investigated forces arising from physical interactions between humans during a cooperative motor task, particularly during overground movements. As such, the direction and magnitude of interaction forces between two human partners, how those forces are used to communicate movement goals, and whether they change with motor experience remains unknown. A better understanding of how cooperative physical interactions are achieved in healthy individuals of different skill levels is a first step toward understanding principles of physical interactions that could be applied to robotic devices for motor assistance and rehabilitation. Methods: Interaction forces between expert and novice partner dancers were recorded while performing a forward-backward partnered stepping task with assigned “leader” and “follower” roles. Their position was recorded using motion capture. The magnitude and direction of the interaction forces were analyzed and compared across groups (i.e. expert-expert, expert-novice, and novice-novice) and across movement phases (i.e. forward, backward, change of direction). Results: All dyads were able to perform the partnered stepping task with some level of proficiency. Relatively small interaction forces (10–30N) were observed across all dyads, but were significantly larger among expert-expert dyads. Interaction forces were also found to be significantly different across movement phases. However, interaction force magnitude did not change as whole-body synchronization between partners improved across trials. Conclusions: Relatively small interaction forces may communicate movement goals (i.e. “what to do and when to do it”) between human partners during cooperative physical interactions. Moreover, these small interactions forces vary with prior motor experience, and may act primarily as guiding cues that convey information about movement goals rather than providing physical assistance. This suggests that robots may be able to provide meaningful physical interactions for rehabilitation using relatively small force levels.},

  abstract = {Shared autonomy provides an effective framework for human-robot collaboration that takes advantage of the complementary strengths of humans and robots to achieve common goals. Many existing approaches to shared autonomy make restrictive assumptions that the goal space, environment dynamics, or human policy are known a priori, or are limited to discrete action spaces, preventing those methods from scaling to complicated real world environments. We propose a model-free, residual policy learning algorithm for shared autonomy that alleviates the need for these assumptions. Our agents are trained to minimally adjust the human's actions such that a set of goal-agnostic constraints are satisfied. We test our method in two continuous control environments: LunarLander, a 2D flight control domain, and a 6-DOF quadrotor reaching task. In experiments with human and surrogate pilots, our method significantly improves task performance even though the agent has no explicit or implicit knowledge of the human's goal. These results highlight the ability of model-free deep reinforcement learning to realize assistive agents suited to complicated continuous control settings with minimal knowledge of user intent.},

The structural properties of port-Hamiltonian systems are discussed, in particular the existence of Casimir functions and its implications for stability and stabiliztion. Furthermore it is shown how passivity-based control results from interconnecting the plant port-Hamiltonian system with a controller port-Hamiltonian system, leading to a closed-loop port-Hamiltonian system.

Important Bowden cable transmission characteristics are discussed, which dictate a specific hardware design for such an actuator. A first prototype is shown, which was used to analyze these basic characteristics of the transmissions and to proof the overall actuation concept. A second, improved prototype is introduced, which is currently used to investigate the achievable performance as a master actuator in a master-slave control with force-feedback. Initial experimental results are presented, which show good actuator performance in a 4 channel control scheme with a slave joint. The actuator features low movement resistance in free motion and can reflect high torques during hard contact situations. High contact stability can be achieved. The actuator seems therefore well suited to be implemented into the ESA exoskeleton for space-robotic telemanipulation},

  abstract = {Force-assembly has been defined as an assembly process for which the use of a single, properly designed, admittance control law will guarantee the proper assembly of a given pair of mating parts. In previous work in workpart-into-fixture insertion, the conditions on a manipulators accommodation control law that ensure proper insertion despite infinitesimal positional error and finite (but bounded) friction have been identified. Through the use of an optimization routine, a control law that satisfies these force-assembly conditions at or below a friction maximum value can be obtained. This single control law, however, is not unique-there exists many other control laws that will satisfy the conditions of force-assembly at the same value of friction. This paper addresses the identification and construction of a linear space of accommodation control law parameters that ensure force-assembly with friction. First, linear sufficient conditions that ensure force-assembly with friction are identified. These linear sufficient conditions are then modified to separate the N/sup 2/+N dimensional space of accommodation control law parameters into N+1 different N-dimensional subspaces. A means of efficiently generating basis nominal velocity vectors and basis accommodation matrices is presented. A nominal velocity selected using any positive linear combination of the nominal velocity basis vectors and an accommodation matrix selected using any positive linear combination of the accommodation basis matrices will guarantee force-assembly (for any value of friction less than that used in generating the basis matrices). A planar example of the construction of each accommodation control law subspace is presented and illustrated in the geometry of the fixturing task.},

We are motivated in this work by the example of traffic weaving, e.g., at highway onramps/off-ramps, where entering and exiting cars must swap lanes in a short distance—a challenging negotiation even for experienced drivers due to the inherent multimodal uncertainty of who will pass whom. Our approach is to learn multimodal probability distributions over future human actions from a dataset of human-human exemplars and perform real-time robot policy construction in the resulting environment model through massively parallel sampling of human responses to candidate robot action sequences. Direct learning of these distributions is made possible by recent advances in the theory of conditional variational autoencoders (CVAEs), whereby we learn action distributions simultaneously conditioned on the present interaction history, as well as candidate future robot actions in order to take into account response dynamics. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach with a human-in-theloop simulation of a traffic weaving scenario.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the general problem of reinforcement learning (RL) in partially observable environments. In 2013, our large RL recurrent neural networks (RNNs) learned from scratch to drive simulated cars from high-dimensional video input. However, real brains are more powerful in many ways. In particular, they learn a predictive model of their initially unknown environment, and somehow use it for abstract (e.g., hierarchical) planning and reasoning. Guided by algorithmic information theory, we describe RNN-based AIs (RNNAIs) designed to do the same. Such an RNNAI can be trained on never-ending sequences of tasks, some of them provided by the user, others invented by the RNNAI itself in a curious, playful fashion, to improve its RNN-based world model. Unlike our previous model-building RNN-based RL machines dating back to 1990, the RNNAI learns to actively query its model for abstract reasoning and planning and decision making, essentially "learning to think." The basic ideas of this report can be applied to many other cases where one RNN-like system exploits the algorithmic information content of another. They are taken from a grant proposal submitted in Fall 2014, and also explain concepts such as "mirror neurons." Experimental results will be described in separate papers.},

While so far researchers focused on abstracting kinematic relations, only little attention has been paid to force information. In this work we study imitation learning of human grasping skills from motion and force data. For this purpose a teleoperation system is realized that allows a human to control a simulated robotic hand and to grasp objects in a virtual environment. Haptic rendering algorithms are implemented to calculate interaction forces that occur when touching the virtual object. While learning of fingertip interaction forces is shown to result in physical inconsistency compared to the demonstrations, we show that learning of internal tensions leads to stable reproductions of the demonstrated grasping skill. Obtained results further indicate an enlarged generalisation capability of grasping skills learnt on the basis of motion and force data compared to grasping skills that encode kinematic relations only.},

The present paper introduces a novel method to determine an upper bound on the radius of attraction by a numerical approach. Thereby, the respective Banach space for initial functions has to be selected and primary initial functions have to be chosen. The latter are used in time forward simulations to determine a first upper bound on the radius of attraction. Thereafter, this upper bound is refined by secondary initial functions which result a posteriori from the preceding simulations. Additionally, a bifurcation analysis is undertaken with the time delay as bifurcation parameter. This analysis results in a possible improvement of the previous estimation. An example of a time-delayed swing equation demonstrates the overall methodology.},

We explore how a common coding of perceived and performed actions may allow actors to predict the what, when, and where of others’ actions. The “what” aspect refers to predictions about the kind of action the other will perform and to the intention that drives the action. The “when” aspect is critical for all joint actions requiring close temporal coordination. The “where” aspect is important for the online coordination of actions because actors need to effectively distribute a common space. We argue that although common coding of perceived and performed actions alone is not sufficient to enable one to engage in joint action, it provides a representational platform for integrating the actions of self and other. The final part of the paper considers links between lower-level processes like action simulation and higher-level processes like verbal communication and mental state attribution that have previously been at the focus of joint action research.},

  abstract = {High speed legged locomotion involves high acceleration and extensive loadings of the leg, which impose critical challenges in actuator design. We introduce actuator dimensional analysis for maximizing torque density and transmission `transparency'. A front leg prototype developed based on insight from the analysis is evaluated for direct proprioceptive force control without force sensors. The vertical stiffness controlled leg was tested on a material testing device to calibrate the mechanical impedance of the leg. By compensating transmission impedance from commanded torque, the leg was able to estimate impact force. For the impact test, the mean absolute error as a ratio of full scale sensor force is 0.041 in the 3406 N/m stiffness experiment and is 0.049 in the 5038 N/m experiment. The results indicate that prescribed force profile control is possible during high speed locomotion.},

  abstract = {We propose a self-supervised approach for learning representations and robotic behaviors entirely from unlabeled videos recorded from multiple viewpoints, and study how this representation can be used in two robotic imitation settings: imitating object interactions from videos of humans, and imitating human poses. Imitation of human behavior requires a viewpoint-invariant representation that captures the relationships between end-effectors (hands or robot grippers) and the environment, object attributes, and body pose. We train our representations using a metric learning loss, where multiple simultaneous viewpoints of the same observation are attracted in the embedding space, while being repelled from temporal neighbors which are often visually similar but functionally different. In other words, the model simultaneously learns to recognize what is common between different-looking images, and what is different between similar-looking images. This signal causes our model to discover attributes that do not change across viewpoint, but do change across time, while ignoring nuisance variables such as occlusions, motion blur, lighting and background. We demonstrate that this representation can be used by a robot to directly mimic human poses without an explicit correspondence, and that it can be used as a reward function within a reinforcement learning algorithm. While representations are learned from an unlabeled collection of task-related videos, robot behaviors such as pouring are learned by watching a single 3rd-person demonstration by a human. Reward functions obtained by following the human demonstrations under the learned representation enable efficient reinforcement learning that is practical for real-world robotic systems.

We also present an active learning approach – inspired by uncertainty sampling – to identify the task execution with the most uncertain degree of acceptability. We demonstrate that active learning within our framework identifies a teacher’s intended task specification to a greater degree of similarity when compared with an approach that learns purely from demonstrations. Finally, we also conduct a user-study that demonstrates the efficacy of our active learning framework in learning a table-setting task from a human teacher.},

Traditional fixed-gain teleoperation methods often sacrifice performance in order to remain stable in the presence of large variations in the environment dynamics. In contrast, the proposed approach adjusts itself to the changes in the environment to maintain its stability without compromising performance. It is assumed that the dynamics of the environment are governed by a model from a finite set of environment models at any given time with Markov chain switching between these models. The first-order generalized pseudo-Bayesian (GPB1) multi-model estimation technique is used to identify the effective model at each time step given the sensory observations. The control action is a weighted sum of mode-based control laws that are designed for each mode of operation. Numerical and experimental studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for teleoperation in free motion and in contact with rigid environments.},

In this systematic review, studies on: 1) variation and 2) learning of appropriate impedance elements are taken into account. These strategies are classified and described in terms of their objectives, points of view (approaches), and signal requirements (including position, HRI force, and electromyography activity). Different methods involving linear/nonlinear analyses (e.g., optimal control design and nonlinear Lyapunov-based stability guarantee) and the Gaussian approximation algorithms (e.g., Gaussian mixture model-based and dynamic movement primitives-based strategies) are reviewed. Current challenges and research trends in physical HRI are finally discussed.},

A good model can potentially enable planning algorithms to generate a large variety of behaviors and solve diverse tasks. However, learning an accurate model for complex dynamical systems is difficult, and even then, the model might not generalize well outside the distribution of states on which it was trained. In this work, we combine model-based learning with model-free learning of primitives that make model-based planning easy. To that end, we aim to answer the question: how can we discover skills whose outcomes are easy to predict? We propose an unsupervised learning algorithm, Dynamics-Aware Discovery of Skills (DADS), which simultaneously discovers predictable behaviors and learns their dynamics. Our method can leverage continuous skill spaces, theoretically, allowing us to learn infinitely many behaviors even for high-dimensional state-spaces. We demonstrate that zero-shot planning in the learned latent space significantly outperforms standard MBRL and model-free goal-conditioned RL, can handle sparse-reward tasks, and substantially improves over prior hierarchical RL methods for unsupervised skill discovery.},

  abstract = {One of the fundamental requirements for the success of a robot task is the capability to handle interaction between manipulator and environment. The quantity that describes the state of interaction more effectively is the contact force at the manipulator's end effector. High values of contact force are generally undesirable since they may stress both the manipulator and the manipulated object; hence the need to seek for effective force control strategies. The book provides a theoretical and experimental treatment of robot interaction control. In the framework of model-based operational space control, stiffness control and impedance control are presented as the basic strategies for indirect force control; a key feature is the coverage of six-degree-of-freedom interaction tasks and manipulator kinematic redundancy. Then, direct force control strategies are presented which are obtained from motion control schemes suitably modified by the closure of an outer force regulation feedback loop. Finally, advanced force and position control strategies are presented which include passivity-based, adaptive and output feedback control schemes. Remarkably, all control schemes are experimentally tested on a setup consisting of a seven-joint industrial robot with open control architecture and force/torque sensor.  The topic of robot force control is not treated in depth in robotics textbooks, in spite of its crucial importance for practical manipulation tasks. In the few books addressing this topic, the material is often limited to single-degree-of-freedom tasks. On the other hand, several results are available in the robotics literature but no dedicated monograph exists. The book is thus aimed at filling this gap by providing a theoretical and experimental treatment of robot force control.},

The proposed approach is evaluated via a human-in-the-loop setup and compared to a generic variable damping state-of-the-art method.

One such class of policies are the semi-parametric H-step lookahead policies, which select actions using trajectory optimization over a dynamics model for a fixed horizon with a terminal value function. In this work, we investigate a novel instantiation of H-step lookahead with a learned model and a terminal value function learned by a model-free off-policy algorithm, named Learning Off-Policy with Online Planning (LOOP). We provide a theoretical analysis of this method, suggesting a tradeoff between model errors and value function errors and empirically demonstrate this tradeoff to be beneficial in deep reinforcement learning. Furthermore, we identify the “Actor Divergence” issue in this framework and propose Actor Regularized Control (ARC), a modified trajectory optimization procedure. We evaluate our method on a set of robotic tasks for Offline and Online RL and demonstrate improved performance. We also show the flexibility of LOOP to incorporate safety constraints during deployment with a set of navigation environments. We demonstrate that LOOP is a desirable framework for robotics applications based on its strong performance in various important RL settings.

  abstract = {We present Residual Policy Learning (RPL): a simple method for improving nondifferentiable policies using model-free deep reinforcement learning. RPL thrives in complex robotic manipulation tasks where good but imperfect controllers are available. In these tasks, reinforcement learning from scratch remains data-inefficient or intractable, but learning a residual on top of the initial controller can yield substantial improvements. We study RPL in six challenging MuJoCo tasks involving partial observability, sensor noise, model misspecification, and controller miscalibration. For initial controllers, we consider both hand-designed policies and model-predictive controllers with known or learned transition models. By combining learning with control algorithms, RPL can perform long-horizon, sparse-reward tasks for which reinforcement learning alone fails. Moreover, we find that RPL consistently and substantially improves on the initial controllers. We argue that RPL is a promising approach for combining the complementary strengths of deep reinforcement learning and robotic control, pushing the boundaries of what either can achieve independently.

However, real-world applications of reinforcement learning must specify the goal of the task by means of a manually programmed reward function, which in practice requires either designing the very same perception pipeline that end-to-end reinforcement learning promises to avoid, or else instrumenting the environment with additional sensors to determine if the task has been performed successfully. In this paper, we propose an approach for removing the need for manual engineering of reward specifications by enabling a robot to learn from a modest number of examples of successful outcomes, followed by actively solicited queries, where the robot shows the user a state and asks for a label to determine whether that state represents successful completion of the task. While requesting labels for every single state would amount to asking the user to manually provide the reward signal, our method requires labels for only a tiny fraction of the states seen during training, making it an efficient and practical approach for learning skills without manually engineered rewards. We evaluate our method on real-world robotic manipulation tasks where the observations consist of images viewed by the robot's camera. In our experiments, our method effectively learns to arrange objects, place books, and drape cloth, directly from images and without any manually specified reward functions, and with only 1-4 hours of interaction with the real world.},

In order to remain robust to modeling error and shifts in payload dynamics, agents must simultaneously perform estimation and control tasks. However, the optimal estimation actions are often not the optimal actions for accomplishing the control tasks, and thus agents trade between exploration and exploitation. This work frames the problem as a Bayes-adaptive Markov decision process and solves it online using Monte Carlo tree search and an extended Kalman filter to handle Gaussian process noise and parameter uncertainty in a continuous space. MCTS selects control actions to reduce model uncertainty and reach the goal state nearly optimally. Certainty equivalent model predictive control is used as a benchmark to compare performance in simulations with varying process noise and parameter uncertainty.},

  abstract = {Supervised deep learning has been successfully applied to many recognition problems. Although it can approximate a complex many-to-one function well when a large amount of training data is provided, it is still challenging to model complex structured output representations that effectively perform probabilistic inference and make diverse predictions. In this work, we develop a deep conditional generative model for structured output prediction using Gaussian latent variables. The model is trained efficiently in the framework of stochastic gradient variational Bayes, and allows for fast prediction using stochastic feed-forward inference. In addition, we provide novel strategies to build robust structured prediction algorithms, such as input noise-injection and multi-scale prediction objective at training. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm in comparison to the deterministic deep neural network counterparts in generating diverse but realistic structured output predictions using stochastic inference. Furthermore, the proposed training methods are complimentary, which leads to strong pixel-level object segmentation and semantic labeling performance on Caltech-UCSD Birds 200 and the subset of Labeled Faces in the Wild dataset.},

However, they can be difficult to use in practice due to poorly understood bias/variance tradeoffs. We theoretically show that, under some conditions, estimators such as MINE exhibit variance that could grow exponentially with the true amount of underlying MI. We also empirically demonstrate that existing estimators fail to satisfy basic self-consistency properties of MI, such as data processing and additivity under independence. Based on a unified perspective of variational approaches, we develop a new estimator that focuses on variance reduction. Empirical results on standard benchmark tasks demonstrate that our proposed estimator exhibits improved bias-variance trade-offs on standard benchmark tasks.},

The human demonstration is modeled using Dynamic Movement Primitives. Following human demonstration, the robot arm is provided with the capacity to perform sequential in-contact tasks, for example writing on a notepad a previously demonstrated sequence of characters. During the reenactment of the task, the system is not only able to imitate and generalize from demonstrated trajectories, but also from their associated force profiles.

One approach is to develop robotic skills, which are pre-programmed software modules that only need to be parametrized by the shop-floor user. In this paper, a new software architecture for robot skills is presented, which aims at robustness and human-robot interaction. In addition, four basic demands on the skill parametrization are described that fasten up the process and increase intuitiveness for the user.

Task-level programming is an established approach, yet appropriate workflows for experts and shop-floor workers remain to be defined. The objective of this letter is to evaluate RAZER, a framework for robot task-level programming, in which skill programming and parameter interface definitions are integrated. The framework provides workflows for both experts-creating skills and providing their parameter interfaces-and for shop-floor workers-using these skills to create executable robot tasks in an intuitive human-robot interface (HRI).

It is also of vital importance for simulating robots, virtual reality, and realistic animation. However, correctly modeling rigid-body dynamics with friction is difficult due to a number of discontinuities in the behavior of rigid bodies and the discontinuities inherent in the Coulomb friction law. This is particularly crucial for handling situations with large coefficients of friction, which can result in paradoxical results known at least since Painlev´e [C. R. Acad. Sci.

A study of this problem is presented, which relates the maximum achievable object stiffness to the elements of the control loop. In particular, we examine how the sampling rate, quantization, computational delay, and amplifier dynamics interact with the inertia, natural viscous, and Coulomb damping of the haptic device. Nonlinear effects create distinct stability regions and many common devices operate stably, yet in violation of passivity criteria. An energy based approach provides theoretical insights, supported by simulations, experimental data, and a describing function analysis. The presented results subsume previously known stability conditions.},

The focus is on designing flexure systems that have a simple geometry, i.e., a parallel constraint pattern. We provide a systematic formulation of the constraint-based approach, which has been mainly developed by precision engineering experts in designing precision machines. The two fundamental concepts in the constraint-based approach, constraint and freedom, can be represented mathematically by a wrench and a twist in screw theory. For example, an ideal wire flexure applies a translational constraint, which can be described by a wrench of pure force. As a result, the design rules of the constraint-based approach can be systematically formulated in the format of screws and screw systems. Two major problems in compliant mechanism design, constraint pattern analysis, and constraint pattern design are discussed with examples in details. Lastly, a case study is provided to demonstrate the application of this approach to the design of compliant prismatic joints. This innovative method paves the way for introducing computational techniques into the constraint-based approach for the synthesis and analysis of compliant mechanisms.},

In our method, geometric constraint models are built to create representations of kinematic constraints such as fixed point, axial rotation, prismatic motion, planar motion and others across multiple degrees of freedom. Our method infers geometric constraints using both kinematic and force/torque information. The approach first fits all the constraint models using kinematic information and evaluates them individually using position, force and moment criteria. Our approach does not require information about the constraint type or contact geometry; it can determine both simultaneously. We present experimental evaluations using instrumented tongs that show how constraints can be robustly inferred in recordings of human demonstrations.},

Our key idea is that position information alone is insufficient to determine that a constraint is active and reaction forces must also be considered to correctly distinguish constraints from movements that just happen to follow a particular geometric shape. Our techniques can detect multiple plane, arc, and line constraints in a single demonstration. Our method uses the principle of virtual work to determine reaction forces from force and position data. It fits geometric constraints locally and clusters these over the whole motion for global constraint recognition. Experimental evaluations compare our force and position constraint inference technique with a similar position-only technique and conclude that force measurements are essential in eliminating false positive detections of constraints in free space.},

What is causing this gap, and how might we use the answer to improve gradientbased methods? We believe a stochastic formulation of dynamics is one crucial ingredient. We use tools from randomized smoothing to analyze sampling-based approximations of the gradient, and formalize such approximations through the bundled gradient. We show that using the bundled gradient in lieu of the gradient mitigates fast-changing gradients of non-smooth contact dynamics modeled by the implicit time-stepping, or the penalty method. Finally, we apply the bundled gradient to optimal control using iterative MPC, introducing a novel algorithm which improves convergence over using exact gradients. Combining our algorithm with a convex implicit time-stepping formulation of contact, we show that we can tractably tackle planning-through-contact problems in manipulation.},

The key idea is that rather than first learning a latent state space model, and then using the learned model for inference, PSIM directly learns predictors for inference in predictive state space. We provide theoretical guarantees for inference, in both realizable and agnostic settings, and showcase practical performance on a variety of simulated and real world robotics benchmarks.},

  abstract = {Safe interaction with human drivers is one of the primary challenges for autonomous vehicles. In order to plan driving maneuvers effectively, the vehicle's control system must infer and predict how humans will behave based on their latent internal state (e.g., intentions and aggressiveness). This research uses a simple model for human behavior with unknown parameters that make up the internal states of the traffic participants and presents a method for quantifying the value of estimating these states and planning with their uncertainty explicitly modeled. An upper performance bound is established by an omniscient Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) planner that has perfect knowledge of the internal states. A baseline lower bound is established by planning with MCTS assuming that all drivers have the same internal state. MCTS variants are then used to solve a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) that models the internal state uncertainty to determine whether inferring the internal state offers an advantage over the baseline. Applying this method to a freeway lane changing scenario reveals that there is a significant performance gap between the upper bound and baseline. POMDP planning techniques come close to closing this gap, especially when important hidden model parameters are correlated with measurable parameters.},

To this aim, rotary series elastic actuators are largely adopted. Torque control is often implemented using a cascade control scheme involving proportional–integral regulators (velocity controller nested in a torque controller) for its simplicity and its potential of ensuring coupled stability. A high-level impedance control loop is also commonly added to regulate the interaction with the external agents. In the present work, conservative passivity conditions are derived when a cascade-controlled series elastic actuator is used to haptically display different models of virtual impedance. In particular, the case of a null impedance, of a pure spring and of series and parallel spring–damper systems (corresponding to standard linear viscoelastic bodies) are analyzed in order to derive design guidelines useful for the selection of the control gains as well as for determining the ranges of renderable virtual impedance.},

  abstract = {To move a hard table together, humans may coordinate by following the dominant partner’s motion [1–4], but this strategy is unsuitable for a soft mattress where the perceived forces are small. How do partners readily coordinate in such differing interaction dynamics? To address this, we investigated how pairs tracked a target using flexion-extension of their wrists, which were coupled by a hard, medium or soft virtual elastic band. Tracking performance monotonically increased with a stiffer band for the worse partner, who had higher tracking error, at the cost of the skilled partner’s muscular effort. This suggests that the worse partner followed the skilled one’s lead, but simulations show that the results are better explained by a model where partners share movement goals through the forces, whilst the coupling dynamics determine the capacity of communicable information. This model elucidates the versatile mechanism by which humans can coordinate during both hard and soft physical interactions to ensure maximum performance with minimal effort.},

This problem arises in several different contexts, including joint encoder and controller design for data-rate minimization in networked control systems. We show that the optimal control law is a linear–Gaussian randomized policy. We also identify the state-space realization of the optimal policy, which can be synthesized by an efficient algorithm based on semidefinite programming. Our structural result indicates that the filter–controller separation principle from the LQG control theory and the sensor–filter separation principle from the zero-delay rate-distortion theory for Gauss–Markov sources hold simultaneously in the considered problem. A connection to the data-rate theorem for mean-square stability by Nair and Evans is also established.},

However, due to the i.i.d. assumption, VAEs only optimize the singleton variational distributions and fail to account for the correlations between data points, which might be crucial for learning latent representations from dataset where a priori we know correlations exist. We propose Correlated Variational Auto-Encoders (CVAEs) that can take the correlation structure into consideration when learning latent representations with VAEs. CVAEs apply a prior based on the correlation structure. To address the intractability introduced by the correlated prior, we develop an approximation by average of a set of tractable lower bounds over all maximal acyclic subgraphs of the undirected correlation graph. Experimental results on matching and link prediction on public benchmark rating datasets and spectral clustering on a synthetic dataset show the effectiveness of the proposed method over baseline algorithms.},

Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) is an indirect method which optimizes only over the unconstrained control-space and is therefore fast enough to allow real-time control of a full humanoid robot on modern computers. Although indirect methods automatically take into account state constraints, control limits pose a difficulty. This is particularly problematic when an expensive robot is strong enough to break itself. In this paper, we demonstrate that simple heuristics used to enforce limits (clamping and penalizing) are not efficient in general. We then propose a generalization of DDP which accommodates box inequality constraints on the controls, without significantly sacrificing convergence quality or computational effort. We apply our algorithm to three simulated problems, including the 36-DoF HRP-2 robot. A movie of our results can be found here goo.gl/eeiMnn.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) for robotics is challenging due to the difficulty in hand-engineering a dense cost function, which can lead to unintended behavior, and dynamical uncertainty, which makes it hard to enforce constraints during learning. We address these issues with a new model-based reinforcement learning algorithm, safety augmented value estimation from demonstrations (SAVED), which uses supervision that only identifies task completion and a modest set of suboptimal demonstrations to constrain exploration and learn efficiently while handling complex constraints. We derive iterative improvement guarantees for SAVED under known stochastic nonlinear systems. We then compare SAVED with 3 state-of-the-art model-based and model-free RL algorithms on 6 standard simulation benchmarks involving navigation and manipulation and 2 real-world tasks on the da Vinci surgical robot. Results suggest that SAVED outperforms prior methods in terms of success rate, constraint satisfaction, and sample efficiency, making it feasible to safely learn complex maneuvers directly on a real robot in less than an hour. For tasks on the robot, baselines succeed less than 5\% of the time while SAVED has a success rate of over 75\% in the first 50 training iterations.},

Robot tasks are defined by a precise definition of socalled skill primitive nets, which are based on Mason’s hybrid force/velocity and position control concept, but it is not limited to force/velocity and position control. Two examples are given to illustrate the formally defined skill primitive nets. We evaluated the controller and the trajectory planner by several experiments. Skill primitives suite very well as interface to robot control systems. The presented hybrid control approach provides a modular, flexible, and robust system; stability is guaranteed, particularly at transitions of two skill primitives. With the interface explained here, the results of compliance motion planning become possible to be examined in real work cells. We have implemented an algorithm to search for mating directions in up to three-dimensional configuration-spaces. Thereby, on one hand we have released compliant motion control concepts and on the other hand we can provide solutions for fine motion and assembly planning. This paper shows, how these two fields can be combined by the general concept of skill primitive nets introduced here, in order to establish a powerful system, which is able to automatically execute prior calculated assembly plans based on CAD-data in uncertain environments.},

The language is designed to allow as much flexibility as necessary on the lowest level of abstraction and is kept as simple as possible with the more abstract layers. A Statechart like model is used to describe the different levels of detail. For this we apply the UML/P and the language workbench MontiCore.

The brain may control complex movements through flexible combination of motor primitives, where each primitive is an element of computation in the sensorimotor map that transforms desired limb trajectories into motor commands. Theoretical studies have shown that a system’s ability to learn actions depends on the shape of its primitives. Using a time-series analysis of error patterns, here we find evidence that humans learn dynamics of reaching movements through flexible combination of primitives that have Gaussian-like tuning functions encoding hand velocity. The wide tuning of the inferred primitives predicts limitations on the brain’s ability to represent viscous dynamics. We find close agreement between the predicted limitations and subjects’ adaptation to novel force fields. The mathematical properties of the derived primitives resemble the tuning curves of Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. Activity of these cells may encode primitives that underlie learning of dynamics.},

The question we address in this paper is in what sense this “flow of information” can be described by Shannon’s measures of information introduced in his mathematical theory of communication. We provide an affirmative answer to this question using an intriguing analogy between Shannon’s classical model of communication and the Perception-Action-Cycle. In particular, decision and action sequences turn out to be directly analogous to codes in communication, and their complexity — the minimal number of (binary) decisions required for reaching a goal — directly bounded by information measures, as in communication. This analogy allows us to extend the standard Reinforcement Learning framework. The latter considers the future expected reward in the course of a behaviour sequence towards a goal (value-to-go). Here, we additionally incorporate a measure of information associated with this sequence: the cumulated information processing cost or bandwidth required to specify the future decision and action sequence (information-to-go).},

  abstract = {Optimal control and estimation are dual in the LQG setting, as Kalman discovered, however this duality has proven difficult to extend beyond LQG. Here we obtain a more natural form of LQG duality by replacing the Kalman-Bucy filter with the information filter. We then generalize this result to non-linear stochastic systems, discrete stochastic systems, and deterministic systems. All forms of duality are established by relating exponentiated costs to probabilities. Unlike the LQG setting where control and estimation are in one-to-one correspondence, in the general case control turns out to be a larger problem class than estimation and only a sub-class of control problems have estimation duals. These are problems where the Bellman equation is intrinsically linear. Apart from their theoretical significance, our results make it possible to apply estimation algorithms to control problems and vice versa.},

  abstract = {Trajectory optimization is done most efficiently when an inverse dynamics model is available. Here we develop the first model of contact dynamics defined in both the forward and inverse directions. The contact impulse is the solution to a convex optimization problem: minimize kinetic energy in contact space subject to non-penetration and friction-cone constraints. We use a custom interior-point method to make the optimization problem unconstrained; this is key to defining the forward and inverse dynamics in a consistent way. The resulting model has a parameter which sets the amount of contact smoothing, facilitating continuation methods for optimization. We implemented the proposed contact solver in our new physics engine (MuJoCo). A full Newton step of trajectory optimization for a 3D walking gait takes only 160 msec, on a 12-core PC.},

The forward dynamics of a 27-dof humanoid with 10 contacts are evaluated in 0.1 msec. Since the simulation is stable at 10 msec timesteps, it can run 100 times faster than real-time on a single core of a desktop processor. Furthermore the entire simulation pipeline can be inverted analytically, an order-ofmagnitude faster than the corresponding forward dynamics. We soften all constraints, in a way that avoids instabilities and unrealistic penetrations associated with earlier spring-damper methods and yet is sufficient to allow inversion. Constraints are imposed via impulses, using an extended version of the velocitystepping approach. For holomonic constraints the extension involves a soft version of the Gauss principle. For all other constraints we extend our earlier work on complementarity-free contact dynamics – which were already known to be invertible via an iterative solver – and develop a new formulation allowing analytical inversion.},

  abstract = {Imitation learning is the process by which one agent tries to learn how to perform a certain task using information generated by another, often more-expert agent performing that same task. Conventionally, the imitator has access to both state and action information generated by an expert performing the task (e.g., the expert may provide a kinesthetic demonstration of object placement using a robotic arm). However, requiring the action information prevents imitation learning from a large number of existing valuable learning resources such as online videos of humans performing tasks. To overcome this issue, the specific problem of imitation from observation (IfO) has recently garnered a great deal of attention, in which the imitator only has access to the state information (e.g., video frames) generated by the expert. In this paper, we provide a literature review of methods developed for IfO, and then point out some open research problems and potential future work.},

  abstract = {Classically, imitation learning algorithms have been developed for idealized situations, e.g., the demonstrations are often required to be collected in the exact same environment and usually include the demonstrator's actions. Recently, however, the research community has begun to address some of these shortcomings by offering algorithmic solutions that enable imitation learning from observation (IfO), e.g., learning to perform a task from visual demonstrations that may be in a different environment and do not include actions. Motivated by the fact that agents often also have access to their own internal states (i.e., proprioception), we propose and study an IfO algorithm that leverages this information in the policy learning process. The proposed architecture learns policies over proprioceptive state representations and compares the resulting trajectories visually to the demonstration data. We experimentally test the proposed technique on several MuJoCo domains and show that it outperforms other imitation from observation algorithms by a large margin.},

Two different methods are used to take into account the inequality constraints in the computation of the stationary value of the action integral: the Valentine variables method and the penalty functions method. The equations of motion resulting from the application of the Valentine variables method, which introduces the concept of "nonsmooth" impacts, constitute the exact model of the constrained mechanical system; such a model is suitable to be employed when the impacting parts of the actual mechanical system are very stiff. The equations of motion resulting from the application of the penalty functions method, which introduces the concept of "smooth impacts," constitute an approximate model of the constrained mechanical system; such a model is suitable to be employed when the impacting parts of the actual mechanical system show some flexibility. Various feedback control laws from the natural outputs and from their time derivatives are studied with reference to both models of impact; the closed-loop systems resulting from the application of the same control law to both models show pretty much the same global asymptotic stability properties. The proposed control laws are only concerned with regulation problems in the presence of possible contacts and impacts among parts of the mechanical system or with the external environment. The effectiveness of the proposed control structure has been tested experimentally with reference to a single-link robot arm, showing a valuable behavior.},

  abstract = {Series Elastic Actuation (SEA) has become prevalent in applications involving physical human-robot interaction as it provides considerable advantages over traditional stiff actuators in terms of stability robustness and fidelity of force control. Several impedance control architectures have been proposed for SEA. Among these alternatives, the cascaded controller with an inner-most velocity loop, an intermediate torque loop and an outer-most impedance loop is particularly favoured for its simplicity, robustness, and performance. In this paper, we derive the \textbackslash emph\{necessary and sufficient conditions\} to ensure the passivity of this cascade-controller architecture for rendering two most common virtual impedance models. Based on the newly established passivity conditions, we provide non-conservative design guidelines to haptically display a null impedance and a pure spring while ensuring the passivity of interaction. We also demonstrate the importance of including physical damping in the actuator model during derivation of passivity conditions, when integral controllers are utilized. In particular, we show the adversary effect of physical damping on system passivity.},

  abstract = {We propose an information-theoretic framework for analyzing control systems based on the close relationship of controllers to communication channels. A communication channel takes an input state and transforms it into an output state. A controller, similarly, takes the initial state of a system to be controlled and transforms it into a target state. In this sense, a controller can be thought of as an actuation channel that acts on inputs to produce desired outputs. In this transformation process, two different control strategies can be adopted: (i) the controller applies an actuation dynamics that is independent of the state of the system to be controlled (open-loop control); or (ii) the controller enacts an actuation dynamics that is based on some information about the state of the controlled system (closed-loop control). Using this communication channel model of control, we provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a system to be perfectly controllable and perfectly observable in terms of information and entropy. In addition, we derive a quantitative trade-off between the amount of information gathered by a closed-loop controller and its relative performance advantage over an open-loop controller in stabilizing a system. This work supplements earlier results [H. Touchette, S. Lloyd, Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 1156 (2000)] by providing new derivations of the advantage afforded by closed-loop control and by proposing an information-based optimality criterion for control systems. New applications of this approach pertaining to proportional controllers, and the control of chaotic maps are also presented.},

  author = {Toussaint, Marc and Ratliff, Nathan},
  abstract = {Abstract — Efficient manipulation requires contact to reduce uncertainty. The manipulation literature refers to this as fun-neling: a methodology for increasing reliability and robustness by leveraging haptic feedback and control of environmental interaction. However, there is a fundamental gap between tra-ditional approaches to trajectory optimization and this concept of robustness by funneling: traditional trajectory optimizers do not discover force feedback strategies. From a POMDP perspective, these behaviors could be regarded as explicit obser-vation actions planned to sufficiently reduce uncertainty thereby enabling a task. While we are sympathetic to the full POMDP view, solving full continuous-space POMDPs in high-dimensions is hard. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach in which trajectory optimization objectives are augmented with new terms that reward uncertainty reduction through contacts, explicitly promoting funneling. This augmentation shifts the responsibility of robustness toward the actual execution of the optimized trajectories. Directly tracing trajectories through configuration space would lose all robustness—dual execution achieves robustness by devising force controllers to reproduce the temporal interaction profile encoded in the dual solution of the optimization problem. This work introduces dual execution in depth and analyze its performance through robustness experiments in both simulation and on a real-world robotic platform. I.},

One of the key challenges of synthetic data, to date, has been to bridge the so-called reality gap, so that networks trained on synthetic data operate correctly when exposed to real-world data. We explore the reality gap in the context of 6-DoF pose estimation of known objects from a single RGB image. We show that for this problem the reality gap can be successfully spanned by a simple combination of domain randomized and photorealistic data. Using synthetic data generated in this manner, we introduce a one-shot deep neural network that is able to perform competitively against a state-of-the-art network trained on a combination of real and synthetic data. To our knowledge, this is the first deep network trained only on synthetic data that is able to achieve state-of-the-art performance on 6-DoF object pose estimation. Our network also generalizes better to novel environments including extreme lighting conditions, for which we show qualitative results. Using this network we demonstrate a real-time system estimating object poses with sufficient accuracy for real-world semantic grasping of known household objects in clutter by a real robot.},

  abstract = {Assistive robots can potentially improve the quality of life and personal independence of elderly people by supporting everyday life activities. To guarantee a safe and intuitive interaction between human and robot, human intentions need to be recognized automatically. As humans communicate their intentions multimodally, the use of multiple modalities for intention recognition may not just increase the robustness against failure of individual modalities but especially reduce the uncertainty about the intention to be predicted. This is desirable as particularly in direct interaction between robots and potentially vulnerable humans a minimal uncertainty about the situation as well as knowledge about this actual uncertainty is necessary. Thus, in contrast to existing methods, in this work a new approach for multimodal intention recognition is introduced that focuses on uncertainty reduction through classifier fusion. For the four considered modalities speech, gestures, gaze directions and scene objects individual intention classifiers are trained, all of which output a probability distribution over all possible intentions. By combining these output distributions using the Bayesian method Independent Opinion Pool the uncertainty about the intention to be recognized can be decreased. The approach is evaluated in a collaborative human-robot interaction task with a 7-DoF robot arm. The results show that fused classifiers which combine multiple modalities outperform the respective individual base classifiers with respect to increased accuracy, robustness, and reduced uncertainty.},

  abstract = {This paper uses robots to assemble pegs into holes on surfaces with different colors and textures. It especially targets at the problem of peg-in-hole assembly with initial position uncertainty. Two in-hand cameras and a force-torque sensor are used to account for the position uncertainty. A program sequence comprising learning-based visual servoing, spiral search, and impedance control is implemented to perform the peg-in-hole task with feedback from the above sensors. Contributions are mainly made in the learning-based visual servoing of the sequence, where a deep neural network is trained with various sets of synthetic data generated using the concept of domain randomization to predict where a hole is. In the experiments and analysis section, the network is analyzed and compared, and a real-world robotic system to insert pegs to holes using the proposed method is implemented. The results show that the implemented peg-in-hole assembly system can perform successful peg-in-hole insertions on surfaces with various colors and textures. It can generally speed up the entire peg-in-hole process.},

The subjects have been instructed to set the needle, enter the skin, and tie knots by using laparoscopic tools within a Minimally Invasive Surgery training box. Variable admittance controlled robots, attached to the tools with force sensors, applied step vice velocity disturbances while subjects were trying to set the needle. Based on the interaction force and end-effector position information, impedances of the left and right hands were computed in four different directions.

An agent seeking power is incentivized to behave in undesirable ways, including rationally preventing deactivation and correction. Others have voiced skepticism: humans seem idiosyncratic in their urges to power, which need not be present in the agents we design.

We prove that, with respect to a wide class of reward function distributions, optimal policies tend to seek power over the environment.},

In order to capture this behavior, not only must dynamic models include accurate representations of transmission friction, compliance, and kinematic error, but also important features of harmonic-drive gear-tooth geometry and interaction must be understood. In this investigation, experimental observations were used to guide the development of a model to describe harmonic-drive operation. Unlike less detailed representations, this model was able to replicate many of the features observed in actual harmonic-drive dynamic response. Unfortunately, since model parameters can only be derived from careful analysis of experimental dynamic response, it seems unlikely that any comparably sufficient representation can be constructed with parameter values obtained from catalogs or simple experimental observations},

We prove no polynomial time algorithm guarantees across all problem instances a constant approximation factor from the optimal. Nonetheless, we present the first polynomial time algorithms with per-instance suboptimality guarantees. To this end, we leverage a separation principle, that partially decouples the design of sensing and control. Then, we frame LQG co-design as the optimization of approximately supermodular set functions; develop novel algorithms to solve the problems; and prove original results on the performance of the algorithms, establishing connections between their suboptimality and control-theoretic quantities. We conclude the paper with two applications.},

  abstract = {Intelligent agents must be able to think fast and slow to perform elaborate manipulation tasks. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has led to many promising results on a range of challenging decision-making tasks. However, in real-world robotics, these methods still struggle, as they require large amounts of expensive interactions and have slow feedback loops. On the other hand, fast human-like adaptive control methods can optimize complex robotic interactions, yet fail to integrate multimodal feedback needed for unstructured tasks. In this work, we propose to factor the learning problem in a hierarchical learning and adaption architecture to get the best of both worlds. The framework consists of two components, a slow reinforcement learning policy optimizing the task strategy given multimodal observations, and a fast, real-time adaptive control policy continuously optimizing the motion, stability, and effort of the manipulator. We combine these components through a bio-inspired action space that we call AFORCE. We demonstrate the new action space on a contact-rich manipulation task on real hardware and evaluate its performance on three simulated manipulation tasks. Our experiments show that AFORCE drastically improves sample efficiency while reducing energy consumption and improving safety.},

In parallel, the use of robots and robotic devices is increasing in several fields, substituting humans in “4D”—dull, dirty, dangerous, and delicate—tasks, and such a trend is boosted by the recent need for social distancing. New challenges in safety assessment and verification arise, due to both the closer and closer human–robot interaction, common for the different application domains, and the broadening of user audience, which is now very diverse. The present paper discusses a cross-domain approach towards the definition of step-by-step validation procedures for collaborative robotic applications. To outline the context, the standardization framework is analyzed, especially from the perspective of safety testing and assessment. Afterwards, some testing procedures based on safety skills, developed within the framework of the European project COVR, are discussed and exemplary presented.},

Based on a generative model (GM) and beliefs over hidden states, the free energy principle enables an agent to sense and act by minimizing a free energy bound on Bayesian surprise. Inclusion of prior beliefs in the GM about desired states leads to active inference (ActInf). In this work, we apply ActInf to general state estimation and control. Suitable codings of prior beliefs recover solutions for standard cost-based optimization frameworks. In contrast to standard cost and constraint-based solutions, ActInf gives rise to a minimization problem that includes both an information-theoretic surprise term and a model-predictive control type of cost term. ActInf thus subsumes classical stochastic control as a special case. We illustrate the performance of ActInf under varying system parameters and compare to classical solutions for estimation and control.},

  abstract = {We present a new approach to motion planning under sensing and motion uncertainty by computing a locally optimal solution to a continuous partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP). Our approach represents beliefs (the distributions of the robot?s state estimate) by Gaussian distributions and is applicable to robot systems with non-linear dynamics and observation models. The method follows the general POMDP solution framework in which we approximate the belief dynamics using an extended Kalman filter and represent the value function by a quadratic function that is valid in the vicinity of a nominal trajectory through belief space. Using a belief space variant of iterative LQG (iLQG), our approach iterates with second-order convergence towards a linear control policy over the belief space that is locally optimal with respect to a user-defined cost function. Unlike previous work, our approach does not assume maximum-likelihood observations, does not assume fixed estimator or control gains, takes into account obstacles in the environment, and does not require discretization of the state and action spaces. The running time of the algorithm is polynomial (O[n6]) in the dimension n of the state space. We demonstrate the potential of our approach in simulation for holonomic and non-holonomic robots maneuvering through environments with obstacles with noisy and partial sensing and with non-linear dynamics and observation models.},

Therefore, robots should be able to learn tactile skills through trial and error by using reinforcement learning algorithms. The input domain for such tasks, however, might include strongly correlated or non-relevant dimensions, making it hard to specify a suitable metric on such domains. Auto-encoders specialize in finding compact representations, where defining such a metric is likely to be easier. Therefore, we propose a reinforcement learning algorithm that can learn non-linear policies in continuous state spaces, which leverages representations learned using auto-encoders. We first evaluate this method on a simulated toytask with visual input. Then, we validate our approach on a real-robot tactile stabilization task.},

  abstract = {Designing reinforcement learning (RL) problems that can produce delicate and precise manipulation policies requires careful choice of the reward function, state, and action spaces. Much prior work on applying RL to manipulation tasks has defined the action space in terms of direct joint torques or reference positions for a joint-space proportional derivative (PD) controller. In practice, it is often possible to add additional structure by taking advantage of model-based controllers that support both accurate positioning and control of the dynamic response of the manipulator. In this paper, we evaluate how the choice of action space for dynamic manipulation tasks affects the sample complexity as well as the final quality of learned policies. We compare learning performance across three tasks (peg insertion, hammering, and pushing), four action spaces (torque, joint PD, inverse dynamics, and impedance control), and using two modern reinforcement learning algorithms (Proximal Policy Optimization and Soft Actor-Critic). Our results lend support to the hypothesis that learning references for a task-space impedance controller significantly reduces the number of samples needed to achieve good performance across all tasks and algorithms.},

State estimation techniques that explicitly capture the dynamics of contact offer the potential to reduce estimation errors from unplanned contact events and improve closed-loop control performance. This is particularly true in highly dynamic situations where common simplifications like no-slip or quasi-static sliding are violated. Incorporating contact constraints requires care to address the numerical challenges associated with discontinuous dynamics, which make straightforward application of derivative-based techniques such as the Extended Kalman Filter impossible. In this paper, we derive an approximate maximum a posteriori estimator that can handle rigid body contact by explicitly imposing contact constraints in the observation update. We compare the performance of this estimator to an existing state-of-the-art Unscented Kalman Filter designed for estimation through contact and demonstrate the scalability of the approach by estimating the state of a 20-DOF bipedal robot in realtime.},

In this paper, the practical issues that emerge during common "peg-inhole" assembly procedures are discussed. In particular, the use of passive Remote Center of Compliance (RCC) devices, capable of compensating the IR non-optimal performance in terms of repeatability, is investigated. The focus of the paper is the design and simulation of a flexure-based RCC that allows the prevention of jamming, due to possible positioning inaccuracies during peg insertion.

  abstract = {Insertion is a challenging haptic and visual control problem with significant practical value for manufacturing. Existing approaches in the model-based robotics community can be highly effective when task geometry is known, but are complex and cumbersome to implement, and must be tailored to each individual problem by a qualified engineer. Within the learning community there is a long history of insertion research, but existing approaches are typically either too sample-inefficient to run on real robots, or assume access to high-level object features, e.g. socket pose. In this paper we show that relatively minor modifications to an off-the-shelf Deep-RL algorithm (DDPG), combined with a small number of human demonstrations, allows the robot to quickly learn to solve these tasks efficiently and robustly. Our approach requires no modeling or simulation, no parameterized search or alignment behaviors, no vision system aside from raw images, and no reward shaping. We evaluate our approach on a narrow-clearance peg-insertion task and a deformable clip-insertion task, both of which include variability in the socket position. Our results show that these tasks can be solved reliably on the real robot in less than 10 minutes of interaction time, and that the resulting policies are robust to variance in the socket position and orientation.},

We build upon the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm to use demonstrations. Both demonstrations and actual interactions are used to fill a replay buffer and the sampling ratio between demonstrations and transitions is automatically tuned via a prioritized replay mechanism. Typically, carefully engineered shaping rewards are required to enable the agents to efficiently explore on high dimensional control problems such as robotics. They are also required for model-based acceleration methods relying on local solvers such as iLQG (e.g. Guided Policy Search and Normalized Advantage Function). The demonstrations replace the need for carefully engineered rewards, and reduce the exploration problem encountered by classical RL approaches in these domains. Demonstrations are collected by a robot kinesthetically force-controlled by a human demonstrator. Results on four simulated insertion tasks show that DDPG from demonstrations out-performs DDPG, and does not require engineered rewards. Finally, we demonstrate the method on a real robotics task consisting of inserting a clip (flexible object) into a rigid object.},

Such incidental transient contact can occur in the course of a collaborative application of the power- and force-limiting type. The proposed metric is intended for the design and development of the robot manipulator as well as for the design of manufacturing applications. Such safety metric can also aid in controlling the robot’s speeds during manufacturing operations by carrying out rapid risk assessments of impending collisions that could arise due to the proximity to the human co-worker. Furthermore, this study contributes by expressing the physical impact between the robot and the human body region as a linear spring-damper model. The influence of the restitution coefficient and the elasticity of the human tissues on the contact duration and contact area during the collision is analysed. With the demonstrated analysis model, the dependence of the power flux density with respect to the robot’s effective mass, speed, and geometrical and damping coefficients during the human-industrial robot manipulator collision process is investigated.},

  abstract = {Within the context of impedance controlled exoskeletons, common actuators have important drawbacks. Either the actuators are heavy, have a complex structure or are poor torque sources, due to gearing or heavy nonlinearity. Considering our application, an impedance controlled gait rehabilitation robot for treadmill-training, we designed an actuation system that might avoid these drawbacks. It combines a lightweight joint and a simple structure with adequate torque source quality. It consists of a servomotor, a flexible Bowden cable transmission, and a force feedback loop based on a series elastic element. A basic model was developed that is shown to describe the basic dynamics of the actuator well enough for design purpose. Further measurements show that performance is sufficient for use in a gait rehabilitation robot. The demanded force tracking bandwidths were met: 11 Hz bandwidth for the full force range (demanded 4 Hz) and 20 Hz bandwidth for smaller force range (demanded 12 Hz). The mechanical output impedance of the actuator could be reduced to hardly perceptible level. Maxima of about 0.7 Nm peaks for 4 Hz imposed motions appeared, corresponding to less than 2.5\% of the maximal force output. These peaks were caused by the stick friction in the Bowden cables. Spring stiffness variation showed that both a too stiff and a too compliant spring can worsen performance. A stiff spring reduces the maximum allowable controller gain. The relatively low control gain then causes a larger effect of stick in the force output, resulting in a less smooth output in general. Low spring stiffness, on the other side, decreases the performance of the system, because saturation will occur sooner.},

  abstract = {Efficient object manipulation based only on force feedback typically requires a plan of actively contact-seeking actions to reduce uncertainty over the true environmental model. In principle, that problem could be formulated as a full partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) whose observations are sensed forces indicating the presence/absence of contacts with objects. Such a naive application leads to a very large POMDP with high-dimensional continuous state, action and observation spaces. Solving such large POMDPs is practically prohibitive. In other words, we are facing three challenging problems: 1) uncertainty over discontinuous contacts with objects; 2) high-dimensional continuous spaces; 3) optimization for not only trajectory cost but also execution time. As trajectory optimization is a powerful model-based method for motion generation, it can handle the last two issues effectively by computing locally optimal trajectories. This paper aims to integrate advantages of trajectory optimization into existing POMDP solvers. The full POMDP formulation is solved using sample-based approaches, where each sampled model is quickly evaluated via trajectory optimization instead of simulating a large number of rollouts. To further accelerate the solver, we propose to integrate temporal abstraction, i.e. macro actions or temporal actions, into the POMDP model. We demonstrate the proposed method on a simulated 7 DoF KUKA arm and a physical Willow Garage PR2 platform. The results show that our proposed method could effectively seek contacts in complex scenarios, and achieve near-optimal performance of path planing.},

This is often due to the fact, that most RL methods do not support explicit consideration of state and input constraints. In this paper, we address this problem for nonlinear systems by introducing a predictive safety filter, which turns a constrained dynamical system into an unconstrained safe system, to which any RL algorithm can be applied `out-of-the-box'. The predictive safety filter receives the proposed learning input and decides, based on the current system state, if it can be safely applied to the real system, or if it has to be modified otherwise. Safety is thereby established by a continuously updated safety policy, which is computed according to a data-driven system model, supporting state and input dependent uncertainties in the prediction.},

  abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) methods have demonstrated their efficiency in simulation environments. However, many applications for which RL offers great potential, such as autonomous driving, are also safety critical and require a certified closed-loop behavior in order to meet safety specifications in the presence of physical constraints. This paper introduces a concept, called probabilistic model predictive safety certification (PMPSC), which can be combined with any RL algorithm and provides provable safety certificates in terms of state and input chance constraints for potentially large-scale systems. The certificate is realized through a stochastic tube that safely connects the current system state with a terminal set of states, that is known to be safe. A novel formulation in terms of a convex receding horizon problem allows a recursively feasible real-time computation of such probabilistic tubes, despite the presence of possibly unbounded disturbances. A design procedure for PMPSC relying on bayesian inference and recent advances in probabilistic set invariance is presented. Using a numerical car simulation, the method and its design procedure are illustrated by enhancing a simple RL algorithm with safety certificates.},

Programmable robotbased assembly systems are often needed, in particular for circumstances in which special assembly equipment is not available or well-trained operators could not be employed economically. Robots with enough compliance can perform not only classic automation tasks, such as spot welding, cargo carrying, etc., but also can operate those tasks which demand the compliant motion capacity of robots. Therefore, the research on robot compliance is especially important for parts assembly by robots, where robot compliant motions and manipulations are essential requirements. This paper presents a number of important issues in robot compliance research, including the specification of robot end-effector compliance; properties of a robot compliance matrix at its end-effector; discussions on passive compliance and active compliance and their comparisons; and derivation of the compliance at the endeffector required for tasks.},

This paper presents a kinetoelastic formulation for compliant mechanism optimization. With a state equation of the mechanism defined by the elasticity theory, the model incorporates not only the kinematic function requirements of the mechanism but, more importantly, the necessary conditions on the compliance characteristics of the mechanism’s structure. The kinematics of the compliant mechanism is defined on rigid bodies of input/output ports and is related to a set of kinetoelastic factors of the mechanism’s compliance matrix. The kinetoelastic formulation is applied to the problem of optimizing a compliant translational joint, producing compliant designs with compliance properties such as the leaf spring type sliding joint as opposed to the notch-type joint. This paper represents an initial development toward a more general methodology for compliant mechanism optimization.},

  abstract = {Planar parallel three-degrees-of-freedom (3-DOF) nanopositioners have been used for sample scanner in scanning probe microscopy (SPM), wafer positioner in nanoimprint lithography, micro/nano manipulation, and precision machining. The performance evaluation indexes involve workspace, natural frequency, input coupling ratio, precision/accuracy, speed, payload capability, and output compliance. The tradeoff of multiple indexes is an important factor needing to be considered in the process of designing a nanopositioner. Stress, input stiffness, fatigue reliability, and force transmission are also the main constraints. This paper describes an optimal approach of selecting 16 key parameters of a planar parallel 3-DOF nanopositioner. Seven performance indexes and four constraints are involved in modelling the nanopositioner. A general analysis, optimization, and decision-making method is presented. All the modified-Pareto-optimality solutions are obtained using a multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm. Different applications select preferred Pareto solutions from the same Pareto front. Several optimization cases are given to show the high efficiency of the proposed modelling and optimization method.

  abstract = {Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) is widely seen as having the potential to be significantly more sample efficient than model-free RL. However, research in model-based RL has not been very standardized. It is fairly common for authors to experiment with self-designed environments, and there are several separate lines of research, which are sometimes closed-sourced or not reproducible. Accordingly, it is an open question how these various existing MBRL algorithms perform relative to each other. To facilitate research in MBRL, in this paper we gather a wide collection of MBRL algorithms and propose over 18 benchmarking environments specially designed for MBRL. We benchmark these algorithms with unified problem settings, including noisy environments. Beyond cataloguing performance, we explore and unify the underlying algorithmic differences across MBRL algorithms. We characterize three key research challenges for future MBRL research: the dynamics bottleneck, the planning horizon dilemma, and the early-termination dilemma. Finally, to maximally facilitate future research on MBRL, we open-source our benchmark in http://www.cs.toronto.edu/\textasciitilde tingwuwang/mbrl.html.},

  abstract = {Many kinds of peg-in-hole assembly strategies for an industrial robot have been reported in recent years. Most of these strategies are realized by utilizing visual and force sensors to assist robots. However, complex control algorithms that are based on visual and force sensors will reduce the assembly efficiency of a robot. This issue is thoughtless in traditional assembly strategies but is critical to further improve the efficiency of assembly automation. In this work, a new assembly strategy that is based on a displacement sensor and a variable compliant center is proposed to improve robot performance in assembly tasks. First, an elastic displacement device for this assembly strategy is designed, and its performance is analyzed. The displacement signal generated by the displacement sensor is used to detect the contact state of the peg and hole and to guide the robot to adjust the posture. Second, an assembly strategy, including the advantages of passive compliance and active compliance, and a simple assembly control system are designed to improve the assembly efficiency. Last, the effectiveness of the proposed assembly method is experimentally verified using a robot with 6 degrees of freedom and a chamferless peg and hole with a small clearance (0.1 mm). The experimental results show that the assembly strategy can successfully complete the precision peg-in-hole assembly and assist the robot in accurate assembly in industrial applications.},

  abstract = {Generating on-purpose impacts with rigid robots is challenging as they may lead to severe hardware failures due to abrupt changes in the velocities and torques. Without dedicated hardware and controllers, robots typically operate at a near-zero velocity in the vicinity of contacts. We assume knowing how much of impact the hardware can absorb and focus solely on the controller aspects. The novelty of our approach is twofold: (i) it uses the task-space inverse dynamics formalism that we extend by seamlessly integrating impact tasks; (ii) it does not require separate models with switches or a reset map to operate the robot undergoing impact tasks. Our main idea lies in integrating post-impact states prediction and impact-aware inequality constraints as part of our existing general-purpose whole-body controller. To achieve such prediction, we formulate task-space impacts and its spreading along the kinematic tree of a floatingbase robot with subsequent joint velocity and torque jumps. As a result, the feasible solution set accounts for various constraints due to expected impacts. In a multi-contact situation of under-actuated legged robots subject to multiple impacts, we also enforce standing stability margins. By design, our controller does not require precise knowledge of impact location and timing. We assessed our formalism with the humanoid robot HRP-4, generating maximum contact velocities, neither breaking established contacts nor damaging the hardware.},

The present article develops a theoretical framework called behavioral dynamics that integrates an information-based approach to perception with a dynamical systems approach to action. For a given task, the agent and its environment are treated as a pair of dynamical systems that are coupled mechanically and informationally. Their interactions give rise to the behavioral dynamics, a vector field with attractors that correspond to stable task solutions, repellers that correspond to avoided states, and bifurcations that correspond to behavioral transitions. The framework is used to develop theories of several tasks in which a human agent interacts with the physical environment, including bouncing a ball on a racquet, balancing an object, braking a vehicle, and guiding locomotion. Stable, adaptive behavior emerges from the dynamics of the interaction between a structured environment and an agent with simple control laws, under physical and informational constraints.},

  abstract = {An accurate dynamics model of a robot is an important ingredient of many algorithms used to solve robotics problems, including motion planning, control, localization, and mapping. Models derived from first principles often contain parameters (e.g. mass, moment of inertia, arm lengths, etc.) for which values are unknown. Those which cannot be easily measured must be estimated from the observed behavior of the robot. A good approach to address this problem is to plan control policies for the robot that elicit maximal amounts of information about the parameters of the system, while still achieving other objectives specified for the robot. In case of parameters subject to drift, this must be done continuously over the lifetime of the robot if costly re-calibrations are to be avoided. In this paper, we introduce a new method that formulates the parameter estimation problem as a continuous partially-observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which plans control policies that optimally trade-off the effort spent on learning parameters and effort spent on achieving regular robot objectives (exploration vs. exploitation), and allow for online, continual parameter estimation. While POMDPs have, until recently, been mostly of theoretical interest due to their inherent complexity, we build on recent advances that allow continuous, Gaussian POMDPs to be approximately-optimally solved in near-real-time rates. We show that the computed control policies lead to improved convergence of the belief of the parameters compared to system identification approaches based on applying random controls.},

The results show participants using the block-based interface successfully implemented robot programs faster with no loss in accuracy while reporting higher scores for usability, learnability, and overall satisfaction. The contribution of this work is showing the potential for using block-based programming to make powerful technologies accessible to a wider audience.},

In active preference learning, a user chooses the preferred behaviour from a set of alternatives, from which the robot learns the user's preferences, modeled as a parameterized cost function. Previous approaches present users with alternatives that minimize the uncertainty over the parameters of the cost function. However, different parameters might lead to the same optimal behaviour; as a consequence the solution space is more structured than the parameter space. We exploit this by proposing a query selection that greedily reduces the maximum error ratio over the solution space. In simulations we demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms other state of the art techniques in both learning efficiency and ease of queries for the user. Finally, we show that evaluating the learning based on the similarities of solutions instead of the similarities of weights allows for better predictions for different scenarios.},

The central notion is the behavior, which consists of the set of time trajectories that are declared possible by the model of a dynamical system. Often, the behavior is defined as the set of solutions of a system of differential equations. Models that specify a behavior usually involve latent variables in addition to the manifest variables the model aims at. We have also described a methodology for modeling interconnected systems, called tearing, zooming, and linking. The underlying mathematical language consists of terminals, modules, the interconnection graph, the module embedding, and the manifest variable assignment. The combination of module equations, interconnection constraints, and manifest variable assignment leads to a latent-variable representation for the behavior of the manifest variables the model aims. This methodology of tearing, zooming, and linking offers a systematic procedure for modeling interconnected systems that is much better adapted to the physics of interconnected systems than input/output-modeling procedures such as, for example, Simulink. The methodology of tearing, zooming, and linking has many things in common with bond graphs.},

We evaluate our method on the task of pushing a collection of objects to desired tabletop regions. Compared to methods which rely only on images or use fixed-length state encodings, our method achieves higher success rates, performs well in the real world without fine tuning, and generalizes to different numbers and types of objects not seen during training.

This poses a substantial challenge due to high-dimensional state spaces and non-linear contact-dynamics. Furthermore, object poses and model parameters, such as friction, are not exactly known and a source of uncertainty. The method proposed in this paper models the task of parts assembly as a belief space planning problem over an underlying impedance-controlled, compliant system. To solve this planning problem we introduce an asymptotically optimal belief space planner by extending an optimal, randomized, kinodynamic motion planner to nondeterministic domains. Under an expansiveness assumption we establish probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality.

  abstract = {In automated manufacturing, robots must reliably assemble parts of various geometries and low tolerances. Ideally, they plan the required motions autonomously. This poses a substantial challenge due to high-dimensional state spaces and non-linear contact-dynamics. Furthermore, object poses and model parameters, such as friction, are not exactly known and a source of uncertainty. The method proposed in this paper models the task of parts assembly as a belief space planning problem over an underlying impedance-controlled, compliant system. To solve this planning problem we introduce an asymptotically optimal belief space planner by extending an optimal, randomized, kinodynamic motion planner to non-deterministic domains. Under an expansiveness assumption we establish probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality. We validate our approach in thorough, simulated and real-world experiments of multiple assembly tasks. The experiments demonstrate our planner's ability to reliably assemble objects, solely based on CAD models as input.},

The core idea of our approach is to explicitly model both the contact dynamics and a torque-based robot controller as part of the underlying system model. Our approach is capable of estimating the state of movable objects for various robot kinematics and geometries of robots and objects. This includes complex scenarios with multiple robots, multiple objects and articulated objects. We have validated our approach in simulation and on a physical robot. The experiments show that multimodal distributions of six degrees of freedom object poses can be accurately tracked in real-time in a complex manipulation scenario.},

Keywords: Adaptive control, Optimal adaptive control, dual control, self-tuning control.  1. INTRODUCTION  Feldbaum's seminal work, Feldbaum \#1960\# and Feldbaum \#1961\#, gave the foundation for the dual control problem. The main idea is that in controlling an unknown system it is necessary to let the controller have dual goals. First, the controller must control the process as well as possible. Second, the controller must inject a probing signal to get more information about the unknown system. By gaining more information better control can be achieved in future steps. The main problem is that to get a better model it is necessa...},

In this paper, we propose a modular approach to such motor learning and control. We review the behavioral evidence and benefits of modularity, and propose a new architecture based on multiple pairs of inverse (controller) and forward (predictor) models. Within each pair, the inverse and forward models are tightly coupled both during their acquisition, through motor learning, and use, during which the forward models determine the contribution of each inverse model's output to the final motor command. This architecture can simultaneously learn the multiple inverse models necessary for control as well as how to select the inverse models appropriate for a given environment.

Domains with more than a single dominant task of interest encourage algorithms that share partial solutions across tasks to limit the required experiment time. We develop and investigate simple hierarchical inductive biases -- in the form of structured policies -- as a mechanism for knowledge transfer across tasks in reinforcement learning (RL). To leverage the power of these structured policies we design an RL algorithm that enables stable and fast learning. We demonstrate the success of our method both in simulated robot environments (using locomotion and manipulation domains) as well as real robot experiments, demonstrating substantially better data-efficiency than competitive baselines.},

Based on the fact that a contact state graph is the union of the subgraphs called a goal-contact relaxation (GCR) graph, the approach consists of algorithms (1) to generate a complete GCR graph automatically given the most constrained contact state in the GCR graph and (2) to merge GCR graphs automatically. The algorithms are implemented for cases in which the most constrained contact state in a GCR graph consists of up to three principal contacts. The ability to capture and represent contact state information effectively and efficiently is essential for robotic operations involving compliant motions, for simulation of contact motions, and for haptic interactions.},

We first train the visual representations by masked modeling of natural images. We then freeze the visual encoder and train neural network controllers on top with reinforcement learning. We do not perform any task-specific fine-tuning of the encoder; the same visual representations are used for all motor control tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first self-supervised model to exploit real-world images at scale for motor control. To accelerate progress in learning from pixels, we contribute a benchmark suite of hand-designed tasks varying in movements, scenes, and robots. Without relying on labels, state-estimation, or expert demonstrations, we consistently outperform supervised encoders by up to 80\% absolute success rate, sometimes even matching the oracle state performance. We also find that in-the-wild images, e.g., from YouTube or Egocentric videos, lead to better visual representations for various manipulation tasks than ImageNet images.},

For example, a learned world model captures knowledge about the environment that applies to new tasks. Similarly, skills capture general behaviors that can apply to new tasks. In this paper, we investigate how these two approaches can be integrated into a single reinforcement learning agent. Specifically, we leverage the idea of partial amortization for fast adaptation at test time. For this, actions are produced by a policy that is learned over time while the skills it conditions on are chosen using online planning. We demonstrate the benefits of our design decisions across a suite of challenging locomotion tasks and demonstrate improved sample efficiency in single tasks as well as in transfer from one task to another, as compared to competitive baselines.

  abstract = {In this paper, we present an overview of robotic peg-in-hole assembly and analyze two main strategies: contact model-based and contact model-free strategies. More specifically, we first introduce the contact model control approaches, including contact state recognition and compliant control two steps. Additionally, we focus on a comprehensive analysis of the whole robotic assembly system. Second, without the contact state recognition process, we decompose the contact model-free learning algorithms into two main subfields: learning from demonstrations and learning from environments (mainly based on reinforcement learning). For each subfield, we survey the landmark studies and ongoing research to compare the different categories. We hope to strengthen the relation between these two research communities by revealing the underlying links. Ultimately, the remaining challenges and open questions in the field of robotic peg-in-hole assembly community is discussed. The promising directions and potential future work are also considered.},

The first half of this paper describes our study on the evaluation of the human pain tolerance limit which determines an individual's safeguarding space. We also show the human-safety-oriented design of a robot. The robot is covered with a viscoelastic material to achieve both impact force attenuation and contact sensitivity, keeping within the human pain tolerance limit. The robot, with simple direct-drive (DD) motor torque detection and emergency stop capabilities, automatically stops whenever any severe H-R contact occurs. In the second half of the paper, we propose a more efficient H-R system, which allows H-R contact for improving work efficiency, as long as the contact does not exceed the human pain tolerance limit. For this purpose, a robot is controlled to reduce its velocity with high reliability at an incipient stage of its contact with a human. Through experiments, we demonstrate the validity and efficient utility of the safeguarding space. The first experiment verifies that the developed robot exerts a contact force less than the human pain tolerance limit establishing the safeguarding space. The second experiment comparatively shows the robot's velocity reduction to accept a safe contact with the human in the space.},

This paper proposes an experimental and analytical approach to simultaneously identify the human feedback and feedforward controllers in the context of human-cyber-physical systems (HCPS). In our experiments, participants play a 1DOF reference-tracking video game, tasked to guide a cursor to follow a pseudo-random trajectory. For such tasks, the model inversion hypothesis suggests that the human operator would implement as a feedforward controller the inverse of the cyber-physicalsystem dynamics. Our results indicate that at lower frequencies (≤ 0.15 Hz), individuals capably invert the system dynamics to implement a feedforward controller, but at higher frequencies, the magnitudes of the estimated feedforward transformation are approximately half those of the exact model inverse. This suggests that a frequency limit at which individuals are unable to follow the system dynamics, and thus, the model inversion prediction is only applicable at lower frequencies.},

  abstract = {We demonstrate model-based, visual robot manipulation of linear deformable objects. Our approach is based on a state-space representation of the physical system that the robot aims to control. This choice has multiple advantages, including the ease of incorporating physical priors in the dynamics model and perception model, and the ease of planning manipulation actions. In addition, physical states can naturally represent object instances of different appearances. Therefore, dynamics in the state space can be learned in one setting and directly used in other visually different settings. This is in contrast to dynamics learned in pixel space or latent space, where generalization to visual differences are not guaranteed. Challenges in taking the state-space approach are the estimation of the high-dimensional state of a deformable object from raw images, where annotations are very expensive on real data, and finding a dynamics model that is both accurate, generalizable, and efficient to compute. We are the first to demonstrate self-supervised training of rope state estimation on real images, without requiring expensive annotations. This is achieved by our novel differentiable renderer and image loss, which are generalizable across a wide range of visual appearances. With estimated rope states, we train a fast and differentiable neural network dynamics model that encodes the physics of mass-spring systems. Our method has a higher accuracy in predicting future states compared to models that do not involve explicit state estimation and do not use any physics prior. We also show that our approach achieves more efficient manipulation, both in simulation and on a real robot, when used within a model predictive controller.},

In contrast with conventional learning controllers, the new controller can deal with unstable situations that are typical of tool use and gradually acquire a desired stability margin. Simulations show that this controller is a good model of human motor adaptation.

The optimal reference trajectory is produced by impedance control, and the impedance parameters are achieved using Q-learning technique, which is implemented based on trajectory tracking errors. The position control with DOB of robot manipulators is implemented to track the virtual desired trajectory, and the DOB is designed to compensate for unknown compounded disturbance function by bounding both tracking error inputs and compounded disturbance inputs in a permitted control region, of which the compounded disturbance function is taken into account of all uncertain terms and external disturbances. The appropriate DOB parameters are selected applying linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) method. Both the impedance control and the bounded DOB control can well guarantee semiglobal uniform boundness of the closed-loop robot systems based on Lyapunov analysis and Schur complement theory. Simulation results are performed to test and verify effectiveness of the investigated combining adaptive impedance control with DOB.},

In this paper, physical haptic feedback mechanism is introduced to result in muscle activity that would generate EMG signals in a natural manner, in order to achieve intuitive human impedance transfer through a designed coupling interface. Relevant processing methods are integrated into the system, including the spectral collaborative representation-based classifications method used for hand motion recognition; fast smooth envelop and dimensionality reduction algorithm for arm endpoint stiffness estimation. The tutor's arm endpoint motion trajectory is directly transferred to the robot by the designed coupling module without the restriction of hands. Haptic feedback is provided to the human tutor according to skill learning performance to enhance the teaching experience. The interface has been experimentally tested by a plugging-in task and a cutting task. Compared with the existing interfaces, the developed one has shown a better performance.},

  abstract = {Efficiently adapting to new environments and changes in dynamics is critical for agents to successfully operate in the real world. Reinforcement learning (RL) based approaches typically rely on external reward feedback for adaptation. However, in many scenarios this reward signal might not be readily available for the target task, or the difference between the environments can be implicit and only observable from the dynamics. To this end, we introduce a method that allows for self-adaptation of learned policies: No-Reward Meta Learning (NoRML). NoRML extends Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML) for RL and uses observable dynamics of the environment instead of an explicit reward function in MAML's finetune step. Our method has a more expressive update step than MAML, while maintaining MAML's gradient based foundation. Additionally, in order to allow more targeted exploration, we implement an extension to MAML that effectively disconnects the meta-policy parameters from the fine-tuned policies' parameters. We first study our method on a number of synthetic control problems and then validate our method on common benchmark environments, showing that NoRML outperforms MAML when the dynamics change between tasks.},

In this case, the lack of the separation principle and the strong nonlinearity in unmeasurable states pose severe technical challenges to global output-feedback control design. To overcome these difficulties, a global nonsingular coordinate transformation matrix in the upper triangular form is firstly proposed such that the nonlinear dynamic model can be partially linearized with respect to the unmeasurable states. And, a new type of velocity observers is designed to estimate the unmeasurable velocities for each system. Then, based on the outputs of the velocity observers, we propose distributed control laws that enable the coordinated tracking control system to achieve uniform global exponential stability (UGES). Both theoretical analysis and numerical simulations are presented to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme. Followed by the original paper, a typo and a mistake is corrected.},

In this paper, we investigate LfO and its difference with LfD in both theoretical and practical perspectives. We first prove that the gap between LfD and LfO actually lies in the disagreement of inverse dynamics models between the imitator and the expert, if following the modeling approach of GAIL. More importantly, the upper bound of this gap is revealed by a negative causal entropy which can be minimized in a model-free way. We term our method as Inverse-Dynamics-Disagreement-Minimization (IDDM) which enhances the conventional LfO method through further bridging the gap to LfD. Considerable empirical results on challenging benchmarks indicate that our method attains consistent improvements over other LfO counterparts.},

  abstract = {Training an agent to solve control tasks directly from high-dimensional images with model-free reinforcement learning (RL) has proven difficult. A promising approach is to learn a latent representation together with the control policy. However, fitting a high-capacity encoder using a scarce reward signal is sample inefficient and leads to poor performance. Prior work has shown that auxiliary losses, such as image reconstruction, can aid efficient representation learning. However, incorporating reconstruction loss into an off-policy learning algorithm often leads to training instability. We explore the underlying reasons and identify variational autoencoders, used by previous investigations, as the cause of the divergence. Following these findings, we propose effective techniques to improve training stability. This results in a simple approach capable of matching state-of-the-art model-free and model-based algorithms on MuJoCo control tasks. Furthermore, our approach demonstrates robustness to observational noise, surpassing existing approaches in this setting.

  abstract = {A method is presented to obtain an inner-approximation of the backward reachable set (BRS) of a given target tube, along with an admissible controller that maintains trajectories inside this tube. The proposed optimization algorithms are formulated as nonlinear optimization problems, which are decoupled into tractable subproblems and solved by an iterative algorithm using the polynomial S-procedure and sum-of-squares techniques. This framework is also extended to uncertain nonlinear systems with L\_2 disturbances and L\_\{\textbackslash infty\} parametric uncertainties. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated on several nonlinear robotics and aircraft systems with control saturation.},

In this letter, we instrument a fabric-based pneumatic gripper with strain and pressure (force) sensors. Using sensors affixed to removable sleeves fit over each gripper finger, we identify the finger position and contact force on a grasped object. We show that we are able to completely deflate and pack the gripper, and then deploy the gripper and sensors to full operation. Finally, we demonstrate closed-loop control of the gripper configuration using the strain sensors to reconstruct pose.},

The learning rule is derived from the principle of maximizing the predictive information in the sensorimotor loop. It is evaluated on robot chains of varying length with individually controlled, non-communicating segments. The comparison of the results shows that maximizing the predictive information per wheel leads to a higher coordinated behavior of the physically connected robots compared to a maximization per robot. Another focus of this paper is the analysis of the effect of the robot chain length on the overall behavior of the robots. It will be shown that longer chains with less capable controllers outperform those of shorter length and more complex controllers. The reason is found and discussed in the information-geometric interpretation of the learning process.},

  abstract = {Today's landscape of robotics is dominated by vertical integration where single vendors develop the final product leading to slow progress, expensive products and customer lock-in. Opposite to this, an horizontal integration would result in a rapid development of cost-effective mass-market products with an additional consumer empowerment. The transition of an industry from vertical integration to horizontal integration is typically catalysed by de facto industry standards that enable a simplified and seamless integration of products. However, in robotics there is currently no leading candidate for a global plug-and-play standard. This paper tackles the problem of incompatibility between robot components that hinder the reconfigurability and flexibility demanded by the robotics industry. Particularly, it presents a model to create plug-and-play robot hardware components. Rather than iteratively evolving previous ontologies, our proposed model answers the needs identified by the industry while facilitating interoperability, measurability and comparability of robotics technology. Our approach differs significantly with the ones presented before as it is hardware-oriented and establishes a clear set of actions towards the integration of this model in real environments and with real manufacturers.},

We show that the stiffness of a rigid body subjected to conservative forces and moments is described by a (0,2) tensor which is the Hessian of the potential function. The key observation of the paper is that since the Hessian depends on the choice of an affine connection in the task space, so will the Cartesian stiffness matrix. Further, the symmetry of the Hessian and thus of the stiffness matrix depends on the symmetry of the connection. The connection that is implicit in the definition of the Cartesian stiffness matrix through the joint stiffness matrix (Salisbury, 1980) is made explicit and shown to be symmetric. In contrast, the direct definition of the Cartesian stiffness matrix in Griffis (1993), Ciblak and Lipkin (1994) and Howard et al. (1996) is shown to be derived from an asymmetric connection. A numerical example is provided to illustrate the main ideas of the paper.},

In this paper, we present a method for learning representations that are suitable for iterative model-based policy improvement, even when the underlying dynamical system has complex dynamics and image observations, in that these representations are optimized for inferring simple dynamics and cost models given data from the current policy. This enables a model-based RL method based on the linear-quadratic regulator (LQR) to be used for systems with image observations. We evaluate our approach on a range of robotics tasks, including manipulation with a real-world robotic arm directly from images. We find that our method produces substantially better final performance than other model-based RL methods while being significantly more efficient than model-free RL.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel approach to haptic teleoperation. Specifically, we use control barrier functions (CBFs) to generate force feedback to help human operators safely fly quadrotor UAVs. CBFs take a control signal as input and output a control signal that is as close as possible to the initial control signal, while also meeting specified safety constraints. In the proposed method, we generate haptic force feedback based on the difference between a command issued by the human operator and the safe command returned by a CBF. In this way, if the user issues an unsafe control command, the haptic feedback will help guide the user towards the safe input command that is closest to their current command. We conducted a within-subject user study, in which 12 participants flew a simulated UAV in a virtual hallway environment. Participants completed the task with our proposed CBF-based haptic feedback, no haptic feedback, and haptic feedback generated via parametric risk fields, which is a state-of-the-art method described in the literature. The results of this study show that CBF-based haptic feedback can improve a human operator's ability to safely fly a UAV and reduce the operator's perceived workload, without sacrificing task efficiency.},

  abstract = {This paper is dedicated to developing an online collision detection and identification scheme for human-collaborative robots. The scheme is composed of a signal classifier and an online diagnosor, which monitors the sensory signals of the robot system, detects the occurrence of a physical human-robot interaction and identifies its type within a short period. In the beginning, we conduct an experiment to construct a data set that contains the segmented physical interaction signals with ground truth. Then, we develop the signal classifier on the data set with the paradigm of supervised learning. To adapt the classifier to the online application with requirements on response time, an auxiliary online diagnosor is designed using Bayesian decision theory. The diagnosor provides not only a collision identification result but also a confidence index which represents the reliability of the result. Compared to the previous works, the proposed scheme ensures rapid and accurate collision detection and identification even in the early stage of a physical interaction. As a result, safety mechanisms can be triggered before further injuries are caused, which is quite valuable and important towards a safe humanrobot collaboration. In the end, the proposed scheme is validated on a robot manipulator and applied to a demonstration task with collision reaction strategies. The experimental results reveal that the collisions are detected and classified within 20 ms with an overall accuracy of 99.6\%, which confirms the applicability of the scheme to collaborative robots in practice.},

We find that existing training objectives for variational autoencoders can lead to inaccurate amortized inference distributions and, in some cases, improving the objective provably degrades the inference quality. In addition, it has been observed that variational autoencoders tend to ignore the latent variables when combined with a decoding distribution that is too flexible. We again identify the cause in existing training criteria and propose a new class of objectives (InfoVAE) that mitigate these problems. We show that our model can significantly improve the quality of the variational posterior and can make effective use of the latent features regardless of the flexibility of the decoding distribution. Through extensive qualitative and quantitative analyses, we demonstrate that our models outperform competing approaches on multiple performance metrics.},

In this paper, we tackle rapid adaptation to new tasks through the framework of metalearning, which utilizes past tasks to learn to adapt, with a specific focus on industrial insertion tasks. We address two specific challenges by applying meta-learning in this setting. First, conventional meta-RL algorithms require lengthy online meta-training phases. We show that this can be replaced with appropriately chosen offline data, resulting in an offline metaRL method that only requires demonstrations and trials from each of the prior tasks, without the need to run costly metaRL procedures online. Second, meta-RL methods can fail to generalize to new tasks that are too different from those seen at meta-training time, which poses a particular challenge in industrial applications, where high success rates are critical. We address this by combining contextual meta-learning with direct online finetuning: if the new task is similar to those seen in the prior data, then the contextual meta-learner adapts immediately, and if it is too different, it gradually adapts through finetuning. We show that our approach is able to quickly adapt to a variety of different insertion tasks, learning how to perform them with a success rate of 100\% using only a fraction of the samples needed for learning the tasks from scratch.

Combined with the adaptive palm and the surface patterned feature, the soft gripper could achieve 40-N grasping force in practice, 10 times the self-weight, at a very low actuation pressure below 100 kPa. With novel soft finger design, the gripper could pick up small objects, as well as conform to large convex-shape objects with reliable contact. The fabrication process was presented in detail, involving commercial-grade three-dimensional printing and molding of silicone rubber. The fabricated actuators and gripper were tested on a dedicated platform, showing the gripper could reliably grasp objects of various shapes and sizes, even with external disturbances.},

  abstract = {Detection identifies objects as axis-aligned boxes in an image. Most successful object detectors enumerate a nearly exhaustive list of potential object locations and classify each. This is wasteful, inefficient, and requires additional post-processing. In this paper, we take a different approach. We model an object as a single point — the center point of its bounding box. Our detector uses keypoint estimation to find center points and regresses to all other object properties, such as size, 3D location, orientation, and even pose. Our center point based approach, CenterNet, is end-to-end differentiable, simpler, faster, and more accurate than corresponding bounding box based detectors. CenterNet achieves the best speed-accuracy trade-off on the MS COCO dataset, with 28.1\% AP at 142 FPS, 37.4\% AP at 52 FPS, and 45.1\% AP with multi-scale testing at 1.4 FPS. We use the same approach to estimate 3D bounding box in the KITTI benchmark and human pose on the COCO keypoint dataset. Our method performs competitively with sophisticated multi-stage methods and runs in real-time.},

In this paper, we advance a definition of a continuous representation, which can be helpful for training deep neural networks. We relate this to topological concepts such as homeomorphism and embedding. We then investigate what are continuous and discontinuous representations for 2D, 3D, and n-dimensional rotations. We demonstrate that for 3D rotations, all representations are discontinuous in the real Euclidean spaces of four or fewer dimensions. Thus, widely used representations such as quaternions and Euler angles are discontinuous and difficult for neural networks to learn. We show that the 3D rotations have continuous representations in 5D and 6D, which are more suitable for learning. We also present continuous representations for the general case of the n dimensional rotation group SO(n). While our main focus is on rotations, we also show that our constructions apply to other groups such as the orthogonal group and similarity transforms. We finally present empirical results, which show that our continuous rotation representations outperform discontinuous ones for several practical problems in graphics and vision, including a simple autoencoder sanity test, a rotation estimator for 3D point clouds, and an inverse kinematics solver for 3D human poses.},

In this work, we discuss the elements that are needed for a robotic learning system that can continually and autonomously improve with data collected in the real world. We propose a particular instantiation of such a system, using dexterous manipulation as our case study. Subsequently, we investigate a number of challenges that come up when learning without instrumentation. In such settings, learning must be feasible without manually designed resets, using only on-board perception, and without hand-engineered reward functions. We propose simple and scalable solutions to these challenges, and then demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed system on a set of dexterous robotic manipulation tasks, providing an in-depth analysis of the challenges associated with this learning paradigm. We demonstrate that our complete system can learn without any human intervention, acquiring a variety of vision-based skills with a real-world three-fingered hand.

Finding a Nash equilibrium for very large instances of these games has received a great deal of recent attention. In this paper, we describe a new technique for solving large games based on regret minimization. In particular, we introduce the notion of counterfactual regret, which exploits the degree of incomplete information in an extensive game. We show how minimizing counterfactual regret minimizes overall regret, and therefore in self-play can be used to compute a Nash equilibrium. We demonstrate this technique in the domain of poker, showing we can solve abstractions of limit Texas Hold’em with as many as 1012 states, two orders of magnitude larger than previous methods.},

  abstract = {Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) have shown great potentials for biomimetic soft robots. The inherent viscoelastic nonlinearities (such as creep and hysteresis) and the vibration dynamics of the DEAs may limit their motion accuracy in practical applications. However, few control efforts are made to handle these problems. In this paper, we propose a feedforward control approach for creep and vibration compensation of a dielectric elastomer actuator. To this end, a relative creep model of the DEA is first established, and a creep compensator based on the relative creep model is designed to eliminate the creep. Then, a vibration compensator based on a zero vibration input-shaping (ZVIS) technique is developed to suppress the vibrational dynamics of the creep-compensated DEA. The experimental results with the proposed control approach demonstrate that the creep of the DEA is reduced from 20\% to less than 7\%, and the overshoot of initially about 38.72\% is almost completely removed.},

@book{Liu.2022old,
 abstract = {To adapt to constantly changing environments and be safe for human interaction, robots should have compliant and soft characteristics as well as the ability to sense the world around them. Even so, the incorporation of tactile sensing into a soft compliant robot, like the Fin Ray finger, is difficult due to its deformable structure. Not only does the frame need to be modified to allow room for a vision sensor, which enables intricate tactile sensing, the robot must also retain its original mechanically compliant properties. However, adding high-resolution tactile sensors to soft fingers is difficult since many sensorized fingers, such as GelSight-based ones, are rigid and function under the assumption that changes in the sensing region are only from tactile contact and not from finger compliance. A sensorized soft robotic finger needs to be able to separate its overall proprioceptive changes from its tactile information. To this end, this paper introduces the novel design of a GelSight Fin Ray, which embodies both the ability to passively adapt to any object it grasps and the ability to perform high-resolution tactile reconstruction, object orientation estimation, and marker tracking for shear and torsional forces. Having these capabilities allow soft and compliant robots to perform more manipulation tasks that require sensing. One such task the finger is able to perform successfully is a kitchen task: wine glass reorientation and placement, which is difficult to do with external vision sensors but is easy with tactile sensing. The development of this sensing technology could also potentially be applied to other soft compliant grippers, increasing their viability in many different fields.

@article{Zhou.2020old,
 abstract = {Grasping is an important characteristic of robots in interacting with humans and the environment. Due to the inherent compliance of soft grippers, they can easily adapt to novel objects and operate safely in a human-centered environment. However, soft hands suffer from poor grasping robustness and operation durability, especially for heavy objects or objects with sharp spikes, mainly due to their fragile material and low structural stiffness of the soft actuators. Thus, the widespread use of soft hands in daily applications is still limited. Existing works have shown a promising direction to enhance grasping performance by solving the contradiction between inherent compliance/adaptability and loading capacity. It is known that the stiffness of the robotic phalange is highly related to the performance of robotic hands. In this article, we propose a novel variable stiffness particle phalange, called VSPP here. The proposed VSPP exhibits variable stiffness characteristics without the need for dedicated actuation by utilizing passive particle jamming resulted from forces in interacting with the environment. The VSPP can cooperate with any kind of actuators, soft or rigid, to function as a compliant and robust robotic hand. A prototype robotic hand based on VSPP could maintain reliable grasping even when pierced by sharp objects such as a needle, a cactus, and a durian. This durability is effective both in air and underwater, thus presents new possibilities for the soft robotic hand to work in a harsh environment. The inherent multidirectional compliance of the VSPP makes safety in human/robot interaction guaranteed. The design and modeling presented in this research will provide useful guidance in VSPP applications. A prototype gripper, VSPP-3, composed of three 2-segments VSPP fingers and pneumatic joints, has been built for demonstrations in reliable and robust grasping of daily objects. The sample grasping has shown that the proposed VSPP has great potential for a robust and durable soft robotic hand or gripper design.},

@misc{Bhirangi.29.10.2021,
 abstract = {Soft sensors have continued growing interest in robotics, due to their ability to enable both passive conformal contact from the material properties and active contact data from the sensor properties. However, the same properties of conformal contact result in faster deterioration of soft sensors and larger variations in their response characteristics over time and across samples, inhibiting their ability to be long-lasting and replaceable. ReSkin is a tactile soft sensor that leverages machine learning and magnetic sensing to offer a low-cost, diverse and compact solution for long-term use. Magnetic sensing separates the electronic circuitry from the passive interface, making it easier to replace interfaces as they wear out while allowing for a wide variety of form factors. Machine learning allows us to learn sensor response models that are robust to variations across fabrication and time, and our self-supervised learning algorithm enables finer performance enhancement with small, inexpensive data collection procedures. We believe that ReSkin opens the door to more versatile, scalable and inexpensive tactile sensation modules than existing alternatives.},

@article{Cirillo.2021,
 abstract = {Tactile data perception is of paramount importance in today's robotics applications. This paper describes the latest design of the tactile sensor developed in our laboratory. Both the hardware and firmware concepts are reported in detail in order to allow the research community the sensor reproduction, also according to their needs. The sensor is based on optoelectronic technology and the pad shape can be adapted to various robotics applications. A flat surface, as the one proposed in this paper, can be well exploited if the object sizes are smaller than the pad and/or the shape recognition is needed, while a domed pad can be used to manipulate bigger objects. Compared to the previous version, the novel tactile sensor has a larger sensing area and a more robust electronic, mechanical and software design that yields less noise and higher flexibility. The proposed design exploits standard PCB manufacturing processes and advanced but now commercial 3D printing processes for the realization of all components. A GitHub repository has been prepared with all files needed to allow the reproduction of the sensor for the interested reader. The whole sensor has been tested with a maximum load equal to 15N, by showing a sensitivity equal to 0.018V/N. Moreover, a complete and detailed characterization for the single taxel and the whole pad is reported to show the potentialities of the sensor also in terms of response time, repeatability, hysteresis and signal to noise ratio.},

 abstract = {Since robotic prehension is widely used in all sectors of manufacturing industry, this book fills the need for a comprehensive, up-to-date treatment of the topic. As such, this is the first text to address both developers and users, dealing as it does with the function, design and use of industrial robot grippers. The book includes both traditional methods and many more recent developments such as micro grippers for the optolectronics industry. Written by authors from academia, industry and consulting, it begins by covering the four basic categories of robotic prehension before expanding into sections dealing with endeffector design and control, robotic manipulation and kinematics. Later chapters go on to describe how these various gripping techniques can be used for a common industrial aim, with details of related topics such as: kinematics, part separation, sensors, tool excahnge and compliance. The whole is rounded off with specific examples and case studies. With more than 570 figures, this practical book is all set to become the standard for advanced students, researchers and manufacturing engineers, as well as designers and project managers seeking practical descriptions of robot endeffectors and their applications.

The novel design incorporates the capability to use real-time analytic methods to measure shape, estimate the contact 3D force distribution, and detect incipient slip. To achieve a compact integration, we optimize the optical path from illumination source to camera and other geometric variables in a optical simulation environment. In particular, we optimize the illumination sources and a light shaping lens around the constraints imposed by the photometric stereo algorithm used for depth reconstruction. The optimized optical configuration is integrated into a finger design composed of robust and easily replaceable snap-to-fit fingetip module that allow for ease of manufacture, assembly, use, and repair. To stimulate future research in tactile-sensing and provide the robotics community access to reliable and easily-reproducible tactile finger with a diversity of sensing modalities, we open-source the design and software at https://github.com/mcubelab/gelslim.},

@article{Yuan.2017old,
 abstract = {Tactile sensing is an important perception mode for robots, but the existing tactile technologies have multiple limitations. What kind of tactile information robots need, and how to use the information, remain open questions. We believe a soft sensor surface and high-resolution sensing of geometry should be important components of a competent tactile sensor. In this paper, we discuss the development of a vision-based optical tactile sensor, GelSight. Unlike the traditional tactile sensors which measure contact force, GelSight basically measures geometry, with very high spatial resolution. The sensor has a contact surface of soft elastomer, and it directly measures its deformation, both vertical and lateral, which corresponds to the exact object shape and the tension on the contact surface. The contact force, and slip can be inferred from the sensor's deformation as well. Particularly, we focus on the hardware and software that support GelSight's application on robot hands. This paper reviews the development of GelSight, with the emphasis in the sensing principle and sensor design. We introduce the design of the sensor's optical system, the algorithm for shape, force and slip measurement, and the hardware designs and fabrication of different sensor versions. We also show the experimental evaluation on the GelSight's performance on geometry and force measurement. With the high-resolution measurement of shape and contact force, the sensor has successfully assisted multiple robotic tasks, including material perception or recognition and in-hand localization for robot manipulation.},

@book{Zhao.2021,
 abstract = {Reinforcement learning (RL) can in principle make it possible for robots to automatically adapt to new tasks, but in practice current RL methods require a very large number of trials to accomplish this. In this paper, we tackle rapid adaptation to new tasks through the framework of meta-learning, which utilizes past tasks to learn to adapt, with a specific focus on industrial insertion tasks. We address two specific challenges by applying meta-learning in this setting. First, conventional meta-RL algorithms require lengthy online meta-training phases. We show that this can be replaced with appropriately chosen offline data, resulting in an offline meta-RL method that only requires demonstrations and trials from each of the prior tasks, without the need to run costly meta-RL procedures online. Second, meta-RL methods can fail to generalize to new tasks that are too different from those seen at meta-training time, which poses a particular challenge in industrial applications, where high success rates are critical. We address this by combining contextual meta-learning with direct online finetuning: if the new task is similar to those seen in the prior data, then the contextual meta-learner adapts immediately, and if it is too different, it gradually adapts through finetuning. We show that our approach is able to quickly adapt to a variety of different insertion tasks, learning how to perform them with a success rate of 100{\%} using only a fraction of the samples needed for learning the tasks from scratch. Experiment videos and details are available at https://sites.google.com/view/offline-metarl-insertion.},

@article{Xiao.2021old,
 abstract = {The fused filament fabrication (FFF) process deposits thermoplastic material in a layer-by-layer manner, expanding the design space and manufacturing capability compared with traditional manufacturing. However, the FFF process is inherently directional as the material is deposited in a layer-wise manner. Therefore, the in-plane material cannot reach the isotropy character when performing the tensile test. This would cause the strength of the print components to vary based on the different process planning selections (building orientation, toolpath pattern). The existing toolpaths, primarily used in the FFF process, are linear, zigzag, and contour toolpaths, which always accumulate long filaments and are unidirectional. Thus, this would create difficulties in improving the mechanical strength from the existing toolpath strategies due to the material in-plane anisotropy. In this paper, an in-plane isotropy toolpath pattern is generated to enhance the mechanical strength in the FFF process. The in-plane isotropy can be achieved through continuous deposition while maintaining randomized distribution within a layer. By analyzing the tensile strength on the specimens made by traditional in-plane anisotropy toolpath and the proposed in-plane isotropy toolpath, our results suggest that the mechanical strength can be reinforced by at least 20{\%} using our proposed toolpath strategy in extrusion-based additive manufacturing.},

 abstract = {The design of physical compliance -- its location, degree, and structure -- affects robot performance and robustness in contact-rich tasks. While compliance is often used in the robot's joints, flange, or end-effector, this paper proposes compliant structures in the environment, allowing safe and robust contact while keeping the higher motion control bandwidth and precision of high impedance robots. Compliance is here realized with flexures and viscoelastic materials, which are integrated to several mechanisms to offer structured compliance, such as a remote center of compliance. Additive manufacturing with fused deposition modeling is used, allowing faster design iteration and low-cost integration with standard industrial equipment. Mechanical properties, including the total stiffness matrix, stiffness ratio, and rotational precision, are analytically determined and compared to experimental results. Three remote center of compliance (RCC) devices and a 1-DOF linear device are prototyped and tested in high-speed assembly tasks.

 abstract = {Advances in soft robotics, materials science, and stretchable electronics have enabled rapid progress in soft grippers. Here, a critical overview of soft robotic grippers is presented, covering different material sets, physical principles, and device architectures. Soft gripping can be categorized into three technologies, enabling grasping by: a) actuation, b) controlled stiffness, and c) controlled adhesion. A comprehensive review of each type is presented. Compared to rigid grippers, end-effectors fabricated from flexible and soft components can often grasp or manipulate a larger variety of objects. Such grippers are an example of morphological computation, where control complexity is greatly reduced by material softness and mechanical compliance. Advanced materials and soft components, in particular silicone elastomers, shape memory materials, and active polymers and gels, are increasingly investigated for the design of lighter, simpler, and more universal grippers, using the inherent functionality of the materials. Embedding stretchable distributed sensors in or on soft grippers greatly enhances the ways in which the grippers interact with objects. Challenges for soft grippers include miniaturization, robustness, speed, integration of sensing, and control. Improved materials, processing methods, and sensing play an important role in future research.},

    abstract="Powder Bed Fusion (PBF) was one of the earliest and remains one of the most versatile AM processes, being well-suited for polymers and metals and, to a lesser extent, ceramics and composites. There are an increasing number of machine variants for fusing powders using different energy sources. The most active area of development is for metal PBF processes using lasers. Laser-Based Powder Bed Fusion (LB-PBF) processes are of great interest across many industries as a means of direct manufacturing. This chapter will cover various approaches to PBF, issues surrounding the handling of powders, and the growing types of applications for these technologies.",

    abstract="Photopolymerization processes make use of liquid polymers that react to radiation to become solid. This reaction is called photopolymerization, and liquids which photopolymerize are known as photopolymers. Photopolymers are widely applied in coating and printing industries, as well as for other purposes. Stereolithography was the first type of Vat Photopolymerization (VPP) process and was developed by Charles Hull as an extension to work he had done previously with photopolymers. In VPP, a container (vat) containing photopolymers is exposed to repeated patterns of radiation corresponding to cross-sections of the part being built. In the case of stereolithography, the radiation was provided by a UV laser. Subsequent variants of VPP processes have involved different radiation sources and several types of layering mechanisms. VPP processes were the first commercialized AM technologies, and they continue to be broadly used across many industries and applications.",
