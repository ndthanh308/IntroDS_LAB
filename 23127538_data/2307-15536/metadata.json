  "abstract": "The emergence of oxygenic photosynthesis was a major event in Earth's evolutionary history and was facilitated by chlorophylls (a major category of photopigments). The accurate modelling of photopigments is important to understand the characteristics of putative extraterrestrial life and its spectral signatures (detectable by future telescopes). In this paper, we perform a detailed assessment of various time-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT) methods for predicting the absorption spectra of chlorophyll a, with particular emphasis on modern low-cost approximations. We also investigate a potential extraterrestrial photopigment called phot0 and demonstrate that the electronegativity of the metal ion may exert a direct influence on the locations of the absorption peaks, with higher electronegativity inducing blue-shifting and vice-versa. Based on these calculations, we established that global-hybrid approximations with a moderate percentage of exact exchange -- such as M06 and PW6B95 -- are the most appropriate compromise between cost and accuracy for the computational characterization of photopigments of astrobiological interest. We conclude with a brief assessment of the implications and avenues for future research.",
