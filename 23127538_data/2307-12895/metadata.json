  "abstract": "The starting point of this paper is the study of the asymptotic behavior, as $p\\to\\infty$, of the following minimization problem $$ \\min\\left\\{\\frac1{p}\\int|\\nabla v|^{p}+\\frac12\\int(v-f)^2 \\,, \\quad \\ v\\in W^{1,p} (Ω)\\right\\}. $$ We show that the limit problem provides the best approximation, in the $L^2$-norm, of the datum $f$ among all Lipschitz functions with Lipschitz constant less or equal than one. Moreover such approximation verifies a suitable PDE in the viscosity sense. After the analysis of the model problem above, we consider the asymptotic behavior of a related family of nonvariational equations and, finally, we also deal with some functionals involving the $(N-1)$-Hausdorff measure of the jump set of the function.",
