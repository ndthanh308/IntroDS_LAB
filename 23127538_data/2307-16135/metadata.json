  "abstract": "The Electron-Ion Collider in China (EicC) has been proposed to study the inner structure of matter and fundamental laws of strong interactions. In this paper, we will present a conceptual design of the tracking system based on the state-of-art silicon detector and Micro-Pattern Gaseous Detector at the EicC and demonstrate that it will enable us to reconstruct charm hadron with good significance, hence study gluonic parton distribution functions in nucleons and nuclei, as well as gluon helicity distributions. The impact study using reweighting techniques shows that the impact of the EicC will be mainly in the large $x$ region. It complements similar physics programs at the Electron-Ion Collider at Brookhaven National Laboratory.",
