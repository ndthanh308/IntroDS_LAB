  "abstract": "The study of our Sun holds significant importance in Space Weather research, encompassing a diverse range of phenomena characterized by distinct temporal and spatial scales. To address these complexities, we developed CAFE-AMR, an implementation of an Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) strategy coupled with a Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equation solver, aiming to tackle Solar Physics-related problems. CAFE-AMR employs standard fluid dynamics methods, including Finite Volume discretization, HLL and Roe class flux formulas, linear order reconstructors, second-order Runge-Kutta, and Corner Transport Upwind time stepping. In this paper, we present the core structure of CAFE-AMR, discuss and evaluate mesh refinement criteria strategies, and conduct various tests, including simulations of idealized Solar Wind models, relevant for Space Weather applications.",
