  "abstract": "It is well known that the tropical climate model is an important model to describe the interaction of large scale flow fields and precipitation in the tropical atmosphere. In this paper, we address the issue of global well-posedness for 2D temperature-dependent tropical climate model in a smooth bounded domain. Through classical energy estimates and De Giorgi-Nash-Moser iteration method, we obtain the global existence and uniqueness of strong solution in classical energy spaces. Compared with Cauchy problem, we establish more delicate a priori estimates with exponential decay rates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result concerning the global well-posedness for the initial-boundary value problem in 2D tropical climate model.",
