To promote sustainability, cities worldwide are promoting a transition to public transportation and active transportation. From these, cycling has proven to provide numerous advantages, including benefits to health \cite{gotschi2016cycling}, economy \cite{clifton2013examining}, and reduction of carbon emissions \cite{NEVES2019130}. Despite these benefits, cycling numbers remain predominantly low in some cities. In contrast, barriers to cycling include hilliness, lack of cycling infrastructure, or appropriate bike storage or parking. Yet, the main deterrent to cycling relates to safety concerns \cite{aldred2015investigating, lawson2013perception, felix2019maturing}. If cyclists feel unsafe or are afraid to cycle, they will prefer other means of transportation.

Thus, for cities aiming to boost cycling numbers and the effectiveness of such strategies, it is increasingly important to understand what affects individuals' perceptions. Perception of cycling safety research explores how individuals subjectively experience cycling accident risk and what fears and events negatively impact one's perception of being involved in a cycling accident. Current research shows that infrastructure layout, fear of traffic, and distracted cycling are some aspects that influence this perception \cite{heinen2010commuting}. Most research focuses on surveys and in-loco and post-riding interviews to compare factors influencing perceptions \cite{sanders2015perceived}. Even though these approaches are vital to understanding cycling perception of safety, they need to be more scalable over space or time due to their high cost (human resources, time, and money). This prevents any analysis of perceptions over time, and qualitative non-scalable data analysis hampers any comparative study across cities or countries.

% Pairwise Comparisons

Studying such perceptions has traditionally been carried out using direct rating methods (users assign a score to each event or situation). This procedure requires a well-defined scale and user training and is particularly difficult to conduct when events or conditions substantially differ from one another \cite{perez2017practical}, which is the case when analyzing real-world environments. In contrast, using pairwise comparisons (users compare two situations and choose one of the two) is often simpler and faster to set up, well-suited for non-expert participants \cite{perez2017practical}, and presents lower measurement error compared to direct ratings \cite{shah2015estimation}. With this in mind, we employ pairwise comparisons to analyze cycling safety perceptions. Moreover, we draw current practice and knowledge from other research areas (e.g., sports outcome prediction and preference learning) about pairwise comparisons and how algorithms can be used to study cycling safety perceptions, something unexplored in cycling safety research. This paves the way to scale safety perception studies and ubiquitously understand how individuals perceive cycling risk.

The main contributions of this paper are as follows. First, we draw knowledge from other research areas about pairwise comparisons and apply them to studying cycling safety perceptions. This novel approach
uses a survey showcasing images of two road environments and asking users which one they find safer, if any. % We use respondents' answers to compare different methodologies previously applied to sports prediction and preference learning, showcasing how these can be directly applied to our main goal: understanding cycling perception of safety.
With the respondents' answers, we compare different methodologies, previously applied to sports prediction and preference learning, and show how these can be directly applied to our main goal: understanding cycling perception of safety. Lastly, we draw from these results to objectively classify cycling environments based on urban characteristics and cycling environments.

% Outline of article
% ######################################################
We divide the article as follows. In the next section, we explore the current literature on pairwise comparisons and how traditional rating methods unravel such data. In Section \ref{sec:survey}, we detail our pairwise comparison survey and present different algorithms to rate cycling environments. Next, in Section \ref{sec:ranking}, we present the methodology, overviewing all pairwise ranking algorithms and environment classification. Section \ref{sec:results} presents the results and highlights what environments are perceived as safer or riskier. Finally, Section \ref{sec:conclusions} concludes the paper and draws possible paths forward.
