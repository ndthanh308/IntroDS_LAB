  "abstract": "We consider self-propelled rigid-bodies interacting through local body-attitude alignment modelled by stochastic differential equations. We derive a hydrodynamic model of this system at large spatio-temporal scales and particle numbers in any dimension $n \\geq 3$. This goal was already achieved in dimension $n=3$, or in any dimension $n \\geq 3$ for a different system involving jump processes. However, the present work corresponds to huge conceptual and technical gaps compared with earlier ones. The key difficulty is to determine an auxiliary but essential object, the generalized collision invariant. We achieve this aim by using the geometrical structure of the rotation group, namely, its maximal torus, Cartan subalgebra and Weyl group as well as other concepts of representation theory and Weyl's integration formula. The resulting hydrodynamic model appears as a hyperbolic system whose coefficients depend on the generalized collision invariant.",
