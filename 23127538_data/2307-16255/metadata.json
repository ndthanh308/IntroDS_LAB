  "abstract": "In this work, we investigate the decay behaviors of several higher strangeonia into $Λ\\barΛ$ through a hadronic loop mechanism, enabling us to predict some physical observables, including the branching ratios. Furthermore, we assess the reliability of our research by successfully reproducing experimental data related to the cross section of $e^+e^-\\toΛ\\barΛ$ interactions. In this context, we account for the contributions arising from higher strangeonia, specifically $φ(4S)$ and $φ(3D)$. Additionally, we extend this study to encompass higher strangeonia decays into other light flavor baryon pairs, such as $Σ\\barΣ$ and $Ξ\\barΞ$. By employing the same mechanism, we aim to gain valuable insights into the decay processes involving these particles. By conducting this investigation, we hope to shed light on the intricate decay mechanisms of higher strangeonia and their interactions with various baryons pairs.",
