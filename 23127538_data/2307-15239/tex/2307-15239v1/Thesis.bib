The major emphasis of the review is on reading as a specific example of cognitive processing. Basic topics discussed with respect to reading are (a) the characteristics of eye movements, (b) the perceptual span, (c) integration of information across saccades, (d) eye movement control, and (e) individual differences (including dyslexia). Similar topics are discussed with respect to the other tasks examined. The basic theme of the review is that eye movement data reflect moment-to-moment cognitive processes in the various tasks examined. Theoretical and practical considerations concerning the use of eye movement data are also discussed.},

  abstract     = {The analysis of experimental data with mixed-effects models requires decisions about the specification of the appropriate random-effects structure. Recently, Barr et al. (2013) recommended fitting 'maximal' models with all possible random effect components included. Estimation of maximal models, however, may not converge. We show that failure to converge typically is not due to a suboptimal estimation algorithm, but is a consequence of attempting to fit a model that is too complex to be properly supported by the data, irrespective of whether estimation is based on maximum likelihood or on Bayesian hierarchical modeling with uninformative or weakly informative priors. Importantly, even under convergence, overparameterization may lead to uninterpretable models. We provide diagnostic tools for detecting overparameterization and guiding model simplification. Finally, we clarify that the simulations on which Barr et al. base their recommendations are atypical for real data. A detailed example is provided of how subject-related attentional fluctuation across trials may further qualify statistical inferences about fixed effects, and of how such nonlinear effects can be accommodated within the mixed-effects modeling framework.},

  abstract     = {How similar is the human mind to the sophisticated machine-learning systems that mirror its performance? Models of object categorization based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved human-level benchmarks in assigning known labels to novel images. These advances support transformative technologies such as autonomous vehicles and machine diagnosis; beyond this, they also serve as candidate models for the visual system itself -- not only in their output but perhaps even in their underlying mechanisms and principles. However, unlike human vision, CNNs can be "fooled" by adversarial examples -- carefully crafted images that appear as nonsense patterns to humans but are recognized as familiar objects by machines, or that appear as one object to humans and a different object to machines. This seemingly extreme divergence between human and machine classification challenges the promise of these new advances, both as applied image-recognition systems and also as models of the human mind. Surprisingly, however, little work has empirically investigated human classification of such adversarial stimuli: Does human and machine performance fundamentally diverge? Or could humans decipher such images and predict the machine's preferred labels? Here, we show that human and machine classification of adversarial stimuli are robustly related: In seven experiments on five prominent and diverse adversarial imagesets, human subjects reliably identified the machine's chosen label over relevant foils. This pattern persisted for images with strong antecedent identities, and even for images described as "totally unrecognizable to human eyes". We suggest that human intuition may be a more reliable guide to machine (mis)classification than has typically been imagined, and we explore the consequences of this result for minds and machines alike.},

In addition, nearly all parietal neurons respond when an eye movement brings the site of a previously flashed stimulus into the receptive field.

  abstract     = {When searching a target in a natural scene, both the target's visual properties and similarity to the background influence whether (and how fast) humans are able to find it. However, thus far it has been unclear whether searchers adjust the dynamics of their eye movements (e.g., fixation durations, saccade amplitudes) to the target they search for. In our experiment participants searched natural scenes for six artificial targets with different spatial frequency throughout eight consecutive sessions. High-spatial frequency targets led to smaller saccade amplitudes and shorter fixation durations than low-spatial frequency targets if target identity was known before the trial. If a saccade was programmed in the same direction as the previous saccade (saccadic momentum), fixation durations and successive saccade amplitudes were not influenced by target type. Visual saliency and empirical density at the endpoints of saccadic momentum saccades were comparatively low, indicating that these saccades were less selective. Our results demonstrate that searchers adjust their eye movement dynamics to the search target in a sensible fashion, since low-spatial frequencies are visible farther into the periphery than high-spatial frequencies. Additionally, the saccade direction specificity of our effects suggests a separation of saccades into a default scanning mechanism and a selective, target-dependent mechanism.},

  abstract     = {With the rise of machines to human-level performance in complex recognition tasks, a growing amount of work is directed towards comparing information processing in humans and machines. These works have the potential to deepen our understanding of the inner mechanisms of human perception and to improve machine learning. Drawing robust conclusions from comparison studies, however, turns out to be difficult. Here, we highlight common shortcomings that can easily lead to fragile conclusions. First, if a model does achieve high performance on a task similar to humans, its decision-making process is not necessarily human-like. Moreover, further analyses can reveal differences. Second, the performance of neural networks is sensitive to training procedures and architectural details. Thus, generalizing conclusions from specific architectures is difficult. Finally, when comparing humans and machines, equivalent experimental settings are crucial in order to identify innate differences. Addressing these shortcomings alters or refines the conclusions of studies. We show that, despite their ability to solve closed-contour tasks, our neural networks use different decision-making strategies than humans. We further show that there is no fundamental difference between same-different and spatial tasks for common feed-forward neural networks and finally, that neural networks do experience a "recognition gap" on minimal recognizable images. All in all, care has to be taken to not impose our human systematic bias when comparing human and machine perception.},

However, translating the fundamental derivations (e.g., as found in Beal (2003)) to the notation of Friston (2013, 2015) is somewhat delicate. Further, the notion of using variational Bayes in the context of a system with Markov blankets requires special attention. This Technical Report presents the derivation in detail. It further illustrates how the variational Bayes method provides a framework for a new computational engine, incorporating the 2-D cluster variation method (CVM), which provides a necessary free energy equation that can be minimized across both the external and representational systems' states, respectively.},

  title        = {The Two Kinds of Free Energy and the Bayesian Revolution},
  abstract     = {The concept of free energy has its origins in 19th century thermodynamics, but has recently found its way into the behavioral and neural sciences, where it has been promoted for its wide applicability and has even been suggested as a fundamental principle of understanding intelligent behavior and brain function. We argue that there are essentially two different notions of free energy in current models of intelligent agency, that can both be considered as applications of Bayesian inference to the problem of action selection: one that appears when trading off accuracy and uncertainty based on a general maximum entropy principle, and one that formulates action selection in terms of minimizing an error measure that quantifies deviations of beliefs and policies from given reference models. The first approach provides a normative rule for action selection in the face of model uncertainty or when information processing capabilities are limited. The second approach directly aims to formulate the action selection problem as an inference problem in the context of Bayesian brain theories, also known as Active Inference in the literature. We elucidate the main ideas and discuss critical technical and conceptual issues revolving around these two notions of free energy that both claim to apply at all levels of decision-making, from the high-level deliberation of reasoning down to the low-level information processing of perception.},

  abstract     = {Classical theories of memory consolidation emphasize the importance of replay in extracting semantic information from episodic memories. However, the characteristic creative nature of dreams suggests that memory semantization may go beyond merely replaying previous experiences. We propose that rapid-eye-movement (REM) dreaming is essential for efficient memory semantization by randomly combining episodic memories to create new, virtual sensory experiences. We support this hypothesis by implementing a cortical architecture with hierarchically organized feedforward and feedback pathways, inspired by generative adversarial networks (GANs). Learning in our model is organized across three different global brain states mimicking wakefulness, non-REM (NREM) and REM sleep, optimizing different, but complementary objective functions. We train the model in an unsupervised fashion on standard datasets of natural images and evaluate the quality of the learned representations. Our results suggest that adversarial dreaming during REM sleep is essential for extracting memory contents, while perturbed dreaming during NREM sleep improves robustness of the latent representation to noisy sensory inputs. The model provides a new computational perspective on sleep states, memory replay and dreams and suggests a cortical implementation of GANs.},

There is a general impression that the field is close to understanding this particular association. Here we frame saliency models probabilistically as point processes, allowing the calculation of log-likelihoods and bringing saliency evaluation into the domain of information. We compared the information gain of state-of-the-art models to a gold standard and find that only one third of the explainable spatial information is captured. We additionally provide a principled method to show where and how models fail to capture information in the fixations. Thus, contrary to previous assertions, purely spatial saliency remains a significant challenge.},

Our main contribution is a thorough evaluation of networks of increasing depth using an architecture with very small (3x3) convolution filters, which shows that a significant improvement on the prior-art configurations can be achieved by pushing the depth to 16-19 weight layers. These findings were the basis of our ImageNet Challenge 2014 submission, where our team secured the first and the second places in the localisation and classification tracks respectively. We also show that our representations generalise well to other datasets, where they achieve state-of-the-art results. We have made our two best-performing ConvNet models publicly available to facilitate further research on the use of deep visual representations in computer vision.},

  abstract     = {Human visual object recognition is typically rapid and seemingly effortless, as well as largely independent of viewpoint and object orientation. Until very recently, animate visual systems were the only ones capable of this remarkable computational feat. This has changed with the rise of a class of computer vision algorithms called deep neural networks (DNNs) that achieve human-level classification performance on object recognition tasks. Furthermore, a growing number of studies report similarities in the way DNNs and the human visual system process objects, suggesting that current DNNs may be good models of human visual object recognition. Yet there clearly exist important architectural and processing differences between state-of-the-art DNNs and the primate visual system. The potential behavioural consequences of these differences are not well understood. We aim to address this issue by comparing human and DNN generalisation abilities towards image degradations. We find the human visual system to be more robust to image manipulations like contrast reduction, additive noise or novel eidolon-distortions. In addition, we find progressively diverging classification error-patterns between humans and DNNs when the signal gets weaker, indicating that there may still be marked differences in the way humans and current DNNs perform visual object recognition. We envision that our findings as well as our carefully measured and freely available behavioural datasets provide a new useful benchmark for the computer vision community to improve the robustness of DNNs and a motivation for neuroscientists to search for mechanisms in the brain that could facilitate this robustness.},

  abstract  = {Recordings of the horizontal component of movements of the eyes were made during monocular and binocular fixation. The variation in the vergence of the eyes over time was found to be of the same order of magnitude as the variation in position of the individual eyes, even though the lateral positions of the two eyes are somewhat correlated. The drift and tremor of the two eyes are not correlated; the over-all correlation is due to the saccadic movements. Saccades in one eye seem to be always accompanied by simultaneous saccades in the other eye which are almost always in the same direction and about the same in size. The maintenance of binocular fixation does not seem to be dependent on a direct response to or sensing of vergence error. Rather, it appears to be dependent on the saccadic responses of the two eyes to their own fixation errors.},

Probabilistic population codes (PPCs), a class of biologically plausible and self-consistent models of neural populations that encode parametric probability distributions, may offer a theoretical setting where it is possible to rigorously study manifold learning. It is natural to define the neural manifold of a PPC as the statistical manifold of the encoded distribution, and we derive a mathematical result that the information geometry of the statistical manifold is directly related to measurable covariance matrices. This suggests a simple but rigorously justified decoding strategy based on principal component analysis, which we illustrate using an analytically tractable PPC.},

Subjects categorized stimuli including (a) words of a frequent category, (b) words of an infrequent category (14\%), and (c) pictures of the frequent category (“novels”; 14\%). The P300 and novelty P3 were uncorrelated with the PDR and differed in their response to experimental manipulation. Therefore, although the three physiological responses often co-occur, they appear to each manifest a distinct function: The PDR may be more closely linked to aspects of behavioral responding than the event-related potentials. Within participants, P300 and PDR latencies accounted for unique portions of the reaction time variance, and amplitudes of all three responses were larger for stimuli recalled on a subsequent test, compared to not recalled. We discuss the possibility that all three responses reflect norepinephric input from the locus coeruleus.},
