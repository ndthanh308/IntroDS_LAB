  "abstract": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the intelligence demonstrated by machines, and within the realm of AI, Machine Learning (ML) stands as a notable subset. ML employs algorithms that undergo training on data sets, enabling them to carry out specific tasks autonomously. Notably, AI holds immense potential in the field of software engineering, particularly in project management and planning. In this literature survey, we explore the use of AI in Software Engineering and summarize previous works in this area. We first review eleven different publications related to this subject, then compare the surveyed works. We then comment on the possible challenges present in the utilization of AI in software engineering and suggest possible further research avenues and the ways in which AI could evolve with software engineering in the future.",
