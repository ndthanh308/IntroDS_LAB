	abstract = {We study numerically the localization properties of a two-channel quasi-one-dimensional Anderson model with uncorrelated diagonal disorder within the nearest-neighbor tight-binding approximation. We calculate and analyze the disorder-averaged transmittance and the Lyapunov exponent. We find that the localization of the entire system is enhanced by increasing the interchain hopping strength . From the numerical investigation of the energy dependence of the Lyapunov exponent for many different interchain hopping strengths, we find that apart from the band center anomaly, which usually occurs in strictly one-dimensional disordered systems, additional anomalies appear at special spectral points. They are found to be associated with the interchain hopping strength and occur at and ±. We find that the anomalies at are associated with the π-coupling occurring within one energy band and those at are associated with the π-coupling occurring between two different energy bands. Despite having a similar origin, these two anomalies have distinct characteristics in their dependence on the strength of disorder. We also show that for a suitable range of parameter values, effectively delocalized states are observed in finite-size systems.},

The phenomenon is much more general and has been observed in a variety of systems, but never directly for matter waves.

The effect is clearly demonstrated through investigations of the transport properties and spatial and momentum distributions. The highly controllable nature of the system may render it useful for investigations of the interplay between disorder and interaction, and to uncover exotic quantum phases.},

The second section is concerned with the methods which can be used to find the density of states, both in the main part of the band, where the coherent potential approximation can be used, and in the tail of the band, where other methods must be used. The third section gives a survey of the theory of localization. There is a detailed discussion of the qualitative differences between localized and extended states which enable a sharp distinction to be made between them. There is a brief survey of the theory of one-dimensional systems and of the percolation problem, and then the Anderson model and its self-consistent modification are discussed. There is also a discussion of numerical work on the Anderson model and the use of path-integral methods. In the final section a tentative theory is proposed to combine various features of the problem which have been revealed by some of the different approaches.},
