This document contains questions that reviewers can raise:
1. How are these counterfactual policies different from policies obtained using causal analysis?
2. Why would one want to derive counterfactual policies this way?
3. What is the use of counterfactual policies?
4. How does this compare with just applying PPO with plus/minus rewards and training until the target return has been hit? Can't we find counterfactuals using such a technique? And what about the insights gotten through them?
