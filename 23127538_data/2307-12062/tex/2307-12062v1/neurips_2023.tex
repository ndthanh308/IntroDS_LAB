% The \author macro works with any number of authors. There are two commands
% used to separate the names and addresses of multiple authors: \And and \AND.
%
% Using \And between authors leaves it to LaTeX to determine where to break the
% lines. Using \AND forces a line break at that point. So, if LaTeX puts 3 of 4
% authors names on the first line, and the last on the second line, try using
% \AND instead of \And before the third author name.

% Stephen's draft
Robust reinforcement learning (RL) seeks to train policies that can perform well under environment perturbations or adversarial attacks. Existing approaches typically assume that the space of possible perturbations remains the same across timesteps. However, in many settings, the space of possible perturbations at a given timestep depends on past perturbations.  
We formally introduce temporally-coupled perturbations, presenting a novel challenge for existing robust RL methods. To tackle this challenge, we propose \ours, a novel game-theoretic approach that treats the temporally-coupled robust RL problem as a partially-observable two-player zero-sum game. By finding an approximate equilibrium in this game, \ours ensures the agent's robustness against temporally-coupled perturbations. Empirical experiments on a variety of continuous control tasks demonstrate that our proposed approach exhibits significant robustness advantages compared to baselines against both standard and temporally-coupled attacks, in both state and action spaces.


% Recent years have witnessed the development of robust training to defend against the vulnerability of RL policies. Existing threat models impose static constraints on perturbations at each timestep and overlook the temporal influence of past perturbations on the current ones, despite its crucial consideration in many real-world scenarios. 
% We formally introduce temporally-coupled attacks to account for the temporal coupling between perturbations at consecutive time steps, presenting a novel challenge for existing robust RL methods. To tackle this challenge, we propose \ours, a novel game-theoretic response approach that treats the temporally-coupled robust RL problem as a partially-observable two-player game. By finding an approximate equilibrium in our approach, \ours ensures the agent's robustness against the learned adversary. Empirical experiments on a variety of continuous control tasks demonstrate that our proposed approach exhibits significant robustness advantages compared to baselines against both standard and temporally-coupled attacks, in both the state and action spaces.
