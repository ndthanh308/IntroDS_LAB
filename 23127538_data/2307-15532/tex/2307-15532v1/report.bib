abstract = {A novel dual-channel chaotic synchronization configuration is proposed. This system is constructed on the basis of two unidirectionally coupled vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs), where a VCSEL subjected to polarization-rotated optical feedback is used as a transmitter and the other VCSEL subjected to polarization-rotated optical injection is used as a receiver. The synchronization and communication performances of such a system are numerically investigated. The results show that, similar to polarization-preserved coupled system with polarization-preserved optical feedback at the T-VCSEL port and polarization-preserved optical injection at the R-VCSEL port, such polarization-rotated coupled system can also realize complete synchronization between each pair of linear polarization (LP) modes and the total output of T-VCSEL and R-VCSEL. Compared with the polarization-preserved coupled system, this proposed system has higher tolerance to mismatched parameters. Furthermore, the average intensities of two orthogonal LP modes are almost the same so that this framework may be used to realize dual-channel chaos communication. Under the additive chaos modulation (ACM) encryption scheme, the encoded messages can be successfully extracted for both of orthogonal LP modes.},

Using the two synchronized chaos output signals fromRLs as two chaotic carriers and adopting a novel message encryption and decryptionmethod, the communication performances, the impact of long-distance fiberchannel and the security of this system, have been analyzed.

We numerically investigate the property of TDS suppression in the intensity and phase space and quantitatively discuss security of the proposed system by calculating the bit error rate of eavesdroppers who try to crack the system by directly filtering the detected signal or by using a similar semiconductor laser to synchronize the link signal and extract the data. The results show that TDS embedded in the chaotic carrier can be well suppressed by properly setting the modulation frequency, which can keep the time delay a secret from the eavesdropper. Moreover, because the feedback light is encrypted, without the accurate time delay and key, the eavesdropper cannot reconstruct the symmetric operation conditions and decode the correct data.},

Two schemes of single-bit and multi-bit extraction methods for random bit generation are carried out to evaluate the entropy rate and the maximum random bit generation rate. For single-bit generation, the generation rate at 20 Gb/s is obtained for physical random bit sequences. For multi-bit generation, the maximum generation rate at 1.2 Tb/s ( $=$ 100 GS/s {\texttimes} 6 bits {\texttimes} 2 data) is equivalently achieved for physical random bit sequences whose randomness is verified by using both NIST Special Publication 800-22 and TestU01.},

abstract = {Ultrafast physical random bit generators based on broadband optical signals have been presented lately at astounding speeds. Some of the most popular mechanisms to obtain such random sequences are through signals that emerge from the coherence collapse operation of semiconductor lasers or from the photodetection signal beating of amplified spontaneous emission optical noise. Especially in the first case, the potential of chaotic signals to synchronize offers a great potential for secure communications. In this paper, we combine two unique properties of semiconductor lasers that operate at a chaotic regime: Their potential to become highly synchronized when optically coupled through appropriate configurations and their ability to seed ultrafast true random bit generators. The concurrent fulfillment of both conditions is shown in this paper and is used to demonstrate experimentally the one-time-pad encryption communication protocol. We report an error-free operation of such an encryption system, exceeding for the first time the Gb/s rate. Forward-error-correction coding is applied on the encryption scheme, in order to drastically reduce the errors of the synchronized true random bit sequences and optimize the decoding performance of the system, while securing the distribution of the random seed.},

abstract = {We present a real-time scheme for ultrafast random number (RN) extraction from a broadband photonic entropy source. Ultralow jitter mode-locked pulses are used to sample the stochastic intensity fluctuations of the entropy source in the optical domain. A discrete self-delay comparison technology is exploited to quantize the sampled pulses into continuous RN streams directly. This scheme is bias free, eliminates the electronic jitter bottleneck confronted by currently available physical RN generators, and has no need for threshold tuning and post-processing. To demonstrate its feasibility, we perform a proof-of-principle experiment using an optically injected chaotic laser diode. RN streams at up to 7  Gb/s with verified randomness were thereby successfully extracted in real time. With the provision of a photonic entropy source with sufficient bandwidth, the present approach is expected to provide RN generation rates of several tens of gigabits per second.},

Concealment is ensured both in the amplitude and in the phase of the optical field, satisfying a sought-after property of optical chaos-based communications. Meanwhile, enhancement of the dynamical complexity, characterized by permutation entropy, coincides with strong TDS suppression over a wide range of parameters, the area for which depends sensitively on the linewidth-enhancement factor.},

abstract = {Polarization-resolved chaotic emission intensities from a vertical-cavity surface-emitting laser (VCSEL) subject to feedback from a fiber Bragg grating (FBG) are numerically investigated. Time-delay (TD) signatures of the feedback are examined through various means including self-correlations of intensity time-series of individual polarizations, cross-correlation of intensities time-series between both polarizations, and permutation entropies calculated for the individual polarizations. The results show that the TD signatures can be clearly suppressed by selecting suitable operation parameters such as the feedback strength, FBG bandwidth, and Bragg frequency. Also, in the operational parameter space, numerical maps of TD signatures and effective bandwidths are obtained, which show regions of chaotic signals with both wide bandwidths and weak TD signatures. Finally, by comparing with a VCSEL subject to feedback from a mirror, the VCSEL subject to feedback from the FBG generally shows better concealment of the TD signatures with similar, or even wider, bandwidths.},

Autocorrelation function (ACF) and mutual information (MI) are used for quantitatively identifying the TDS of chaos. For various bias currents, the TDS evolution with the feedback strength is different, as the FBG provides wavelength-selective feedback. Furthermore, based on the TDS map of the FBG feedback VCSEL (FBGF-VCSEL) in the parameter space of feedback strength and bias current, the optimal TDS suppression regions, where the dominant polarization mode of FBGF-VCSEL locates at the edge of the main lobe of FBG reflection spectrum, have been determined. Finally, for comparative purpose, the TDS of chaos in mirror feedback VCSEL (MF-VCSEL) also has been presented, and the results show that an FBGF-VCSEL possesses better TDS suppression performance than an MF-VCSEL.},

The dynamic states including stable locking, periodic oscillation, chaotic oscillation, regular pulsing, quasiperiodic pulsing, and chaotic pulsing seen in a semiconductor laser subject to either optical injection or delayed optoelectronic feedback alone, can all be found in this hybrid system where the laser is subject to both optical injection and optoelectronic feedback. While this system can follow either the period-doubling or the quasiperiodic route to chaos, transition states bridging chaotic oscillation states and chaotic pulsing states are identified and shown. Mappings of dynamic states in the parameter space are plotted, where a large expansion and shifting of the chaos region is observed and is compared with an optically injected laser without optoelectronic feedback. As the injection strength increases, the bandwidths of the chaotic states in the broadened area of this hybrid system are significantly enhanced. The advantages and potential applications of this hybrid system are discussed.}

To follow this strategy, simple robust systems and a systematic approach determining the required dynamical properties and most suitable conditions for this application are needed. We show that dynamics of a single mode laser with polarization-rotated feedback are optimal for random bit generation when characterized simultaneously by a broad power spectrum and low autocorrelation. We observe that successful random bit generation also is sensitive to digitization and postprocessing procedures. Applying the identified criteria, we achieve fast random bit generation rates (up to 4 Gbit/s) with minimal postprocessing.},

abstract = {Period-one (P1) oscillations in a semiconductor laser under optical feedback from a narrowband fiber Bragg grating (FBG) are numerically investigated. FBG feedback enhances the stability of P1 oscillations compared to the conventional mirror feedback in the form of P1 microwave linewidth and phase noise reduction and residual noise peaks suppression. In the proposed scheme, the FBG has a narrow bandwidth smaller than the laser relaxation oscillation frequency. Then it effectively suppresses the coherence collapse of the laser by filtered feedback. Hence it can keep the laser in P1 operation even under relatively strong feedback. Besides, a uniform FBG has a comb-filtered reflectivity spectrum with a main lobe surrounded by several side lobes. Hence it can limit the external cavity modes by each lobe. As a result, FBG feedback can reduce microwave linewidth and phase noise by sustaining stronger feedback power and improve side-peak suppression ratio (SPSR) by filtering external cavity modes. The effects of stabilization are enhanced by properly increasing grating bandwidth. By fine-tuning the feedback delay time, the microwave linewidth can be reduced to a local minimum which reveals the optimal locking between P1 frequency and one of the external cavity modes. Increasing the feedback delay time, the local minimum linewidth can be further reduced. FBG feedback reduces the microwave linewidth by up to more than an order of magnitude and improves the SPSR by up to more than two orders of magnitude than mirror feedback using the same delay time.},

Due to dispersion-induced nonlinearity of chirped grating, the time delay signature (TDS) can be suppressed or erased and the complexity enhancement is expected. The effects of laser parameters on PE as well as the TDS are studied in detail. The results show that for CFBG feedback, the TDS can be suppressed in the range of parameters where linewidth enhancement factor exceeds 3 and gain saturation coefficient is lower than 4×10−4 μm3, and the complexity of chaotic signals is enhanced. As the feedback strength and bias current increase, the PE value under CFBG feedback increases linearly to a maximum of 0.994 and remains stable. Compared with mirror feedback, CFBG feedback can achieve increased complexity over a wider range of parameters. In addition, when the dispersion value of the chirped grating exceeds 2000 ps/nm, the frequency detuning range of -15 GHz to 10 GHz is beneficial to obtain chaotic signals with higher PE values.}

The presence of RO in SLs contributes to abundant complex dynamics when the laser is perturbed by external optical feedback (EOF). In this work, the influence of feedback optical phase on the relaxation oscillation frequency (ROF) in an SL is investigated both theoretically and experimentally. By numerically solving the well-known Lang Kobayashi equations, the relationship between the ROF and feedback optical phase was obtained, which shows ROF is in a sinusoidal manner with respect to the feedback optical phase under weak feedback strength. A simplified mathematic expression for ROF was derived to describe such a sinusoidal relationship. Potential sensing applications can be developed based on the relationship. As an example, a new method of measuring linewidth enhancement factor of an SL was presented. Finally, an experimental setup was built and experiments were carried out to verify the relationship and the measurement method for linewidth enhancement factor.},

abstract = {A large-capacity, long-distance distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) system without inline optical amplification was proposed and experimentally demonstrated using an ultra-weak fiber Bragg grating (UWFBG) array and coherent detection. The effect of the finite extinction ratio of an acousto-optic modulator and the Stokes signal of stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in UWFBGs on the performance of DAS was simulated and revealed. A high extinction ratio and a balanced input pulsed optical power can improve the capacity and distance of the DAS. The dynamic acoustic signal can be well reconstructed for a serial array of 10828 near-identical UWFBG with a length of 54.14 km. An acoustic signal sensitivity of 189.54 p\&\#x025B;/\&\#x221A;Hz and a signal SNR of 40.01 dB with a spatial resolution of 5 m can be achieved at the far end.},

abstract = {Semiconductor lasers (SLs) show relaxation oscillation (RO) due to the cavity damping rate being higher than the carrier damping rate. The presence of RO in SLs contributes to abundant complex dynamics when the laser is perturbed by external optical feedback (EOF). In this work, the influence of feedback optical phase on the relaxation oscillation frequency (ROF) in an SL is investigated both theoretically and experimentally. By numerically solving the well-known Lang Kobayashi equations, the relationship between the ROF and feedback optical phase was obtained, which shows ROF is in a sinusoidal manner with respect to the feedback optical phase under weak feedback strength. A simplified mathematic expression for ROF was derived to describe such a sinusoidal relationship. Potential sensing applications can be developed based on the relationship. As an example, a new method of measuring linewidth enhancement factor of an SL was presented. Finally, an experimental setup was built and experiments were carried out to verify the relationship and the measurement method for linewidth enhancement factor.},

abstract = {An 852 nm semiconductor laser is experimentally subjected to phase-conjugate time-delayed feedback achieved through four-wave mixing in a photorefractive (\$ \{\{\{\textblackslash\}rm BaTiO\}_\{3\}\} \$BaTiO3) crystal. Permutation entropy (PE) is used to uncover distinctive temporal signatures corresponding to the sub-harmonics of the round-trip time and the relaxation oscillations. Complex spatiotemporal outputs with high PE mostly upwards of \$ \{\textblackslash\}sim 0.85 \$$\sim$0.85 and chaos bandwidth (BW) up to \$ \{\textblackslash\}sim 31\{\textblackslash\};\{\{\textblackslash\}rm GHz\} \$$\sim$31GHz are observed over feedback strengths up to 7\%. The low-feedback region counterintuitively exhibits spatiotemporal reorganization, and the variation in the chaos BW is restricted within a small range of 1.66 GHz, marking the transition between the dynamics driven by the relaxation oscillations and the external cavity round-trip time. The immunity of the chaos BW and the complexity against such spatiotemporal reorganization show promise as an excellent candidate for secure communication applications.},
