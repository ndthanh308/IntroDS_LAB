  "abstract": "In this paper we study the existence of bound states of the following class of quasilinear problems, \\begin{equation*} \\left\\{ \\begin{aligned}\n  &-\\varepsilon ^pΔ_pu+V(x)u^{p-1}=f(u)+u^{p^\\ast -1},\\ u>0,\\ \\text{in}\\ \\mathbb{R}^{N},\n  &\\lim _{|x|\\rightarrow \\infty }u(x) = 0 , \\end{aligned} \\right. \\end{equation*} where $\\varepsilon>0$ is small, $1<p<N,$ $f$ is a nonlinearity with general subcritical growth in the Sobolev sense, $p^{\\ast } = pN/(N-p)$ and $V$ is a continuous nonnegative potential. By introducing a new set of hypotheses, our analysis includes the critical frequency case which allows the potential $V$ to not be necessarily bounded below away from zero. We also study the regularity and behavior of positive solutions as $|x|\\rightarrow \\infty$ or $\\varepsilon \\rightarrow 0,$ proving that they are uniformly bounded and concentrate around suitable points of $\\mathbb{R}^N,$ that may include local minima of $V$.",
