\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we present an RL algorithm aimed at settings where data collection and reward specification are difficult. Our method learns from a combination of high-return states and reward-free trajectories, integrating these two types of information to learn reward-maximizing policies. Whereas prior methods perform this integration by learning a reward function and then applying an off-the-shelf RL algorithm, ours learns an implicit dynamics model. Not only is our method simpler (no additional RL algorithm required!), but also it achieves higher success rates than prior methods.

While our experiments only start to study the ability of contrastive-based methods to scale to high-dimensional observations, we conjecture that methods like LAEO may be particularly amenable to such problems because the method for learning the representations (contrastive learning) resembles prior representation learning methods~\citep{mazoure2020deep, nair2022r3m}. Scaling this method to very large offline datasets is an important direction for future work.  \looseness=-1
