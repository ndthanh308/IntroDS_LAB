\begin{abstract}
The {\GHA} problem asks: how can $n$ houses (each with a fixed non-negative value) be assigned to the vertices of an undirected graph $G$, so as to minimize the ``aggregate local envy'', i.e., the sum of absolute differences along the edges of $G$? This problem generalizes the classical {\MLA} problem, as well as the well-known \emph{House Allocation Problem} from Economics, the latter of which has notable practical applications in organ exchanges. Recent work has studied the computational aspects of {\GHA} and observed that the problem is NP-hard and inapproximable even on particularly simple classes of graphs, such as vertex disjoint unions of paths. However, the dependence of any approximations on the structural properties of the underlying graph had not been studied.

In this work, we give a complete characterization of the approximability of {\GHA}. We present algorithms to approximate the optimal envy on general graphs, trees, planar graphs, bounded-degree graphs, bounded-degree planar graphs, and bounded-degree trees.
For each of these graph classes, we then prove \emph{matching} lower bounds, showing that in each case, no significant improvement can be attained unless P = NP. We also present general approximation ratios as a function of structural parameters of the underlying graph, such as treewidth; these match the aforementioned tight upper bounds in general, and are significantly better approximations for many natural subclasses of graphs. Finally, we present constant factor approximation schemes for the special classes of complete binary trees and random graphs. 
% present a simple $3$-approximation algorithm to compute a minimum envy allocation on complete binary trees. We complement this result by showing that a natural class of algorithms (``value-agnostic'' procedures) cannot attain an approximation ratio better than 1.66 on complete binary trees.
% Finally, we investigate the special case of bounded-degree trees in some detail. We first refute a conjecture by \cite{canon} about the structural properties of exact optimal allocations on binary trees by means of a counterexample on a depth-$3$ complete binary tree. This refutation, together with our hardness results on trees, might suggest that approximating the optimal envy even on complete binary trees is infeasible. Nevertheless, we present a linear-time algorithm that attains a 3-approximation on complete binary trees. 
% %We show that a natural class of algorithms (``value-agnostic'' procedures) cannot attain an approximation ratio better than 1.66 on complete binary trees.
% We leave open the intriguing question of whether {\GHA} is NP-hard on binary trees.

Some of the technical highlights of our work are the use of expansion properties of Ramanujan graphs in the context of a classical resource allocation problem, and approximating optimal cuts in binary trees by analyzing the behavior of consecutive runs in bitstrings.
% Most of our results rely on exploiting graph structures to reason about optimal arrangements. In particular, several of our hardness reductions are quite technical; in one case, we make use of the expansion properties of Ramanujan graphs. To our knowledge, the use of these graphs and these techniques in the context of resource allocation problems is novel.
