  "abstract": "A light Higgs boson, with mass of the order of 100 GeV, is still not excluded by the existing experimental data, provided its coupling to gauge bosons is strongly suppressed compared to a SM-like Higgs boson at the same mass. Also other couplings of such a scalar could be very different from the SM predictions leading to non-standard decay paterns. Considered in the presented study is the feasibility of direct observation of the 96 GeV Higgs boson of N2HDM model with dominant decays to tau lepton pairs.",
