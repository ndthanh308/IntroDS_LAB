  "abstract": "Multiferroic CoFe2O4-Ba0.95Ca0.05Ti0.89Sn0.11O3 core-shell nanofibers (CFO@BCTSn NFs) were synthesized by a sol-gel co-axial electrospinning technique. The scanning electron microscope and transmission electron microscope were used to check nanofibers' core-shell structure/configuration. X-ray diffraction and a high-resolution transmission electron microscope were used to confirm the spinel structure of CFO and the perovskite structure of BCTSn. The magnetic character of the resultant CFO@BCTSn NFs was determined by SQUID magnetometry. The piezoelectricity was verified using piezo-response force microscopy, which revealed an entirely covered ferroelectric shell outline, in accordance with SEM and TEM observations. The magnetoelectric (ME) coefficient was measured as a function of the applied external DC magnetic field. The maximum ME coefficient obtained for the CFO@BCTSn NFs was 346 mV cm-1 Oe-1. The high magnetoelectric coupling suggests that CFO@BCTSn NFs could be a promising candidate for magnetic field sensor and magnetoelectric device applications.",
