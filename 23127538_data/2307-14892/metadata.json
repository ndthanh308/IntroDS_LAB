  "abstract": "We propose a minimal setup for a quantum heat pump, consisting of two tunnel-coupled quantum dots, each hosting a single level and each being coupled to a different fermionic reservoir. The working principle relies on both non-Markovian system-bath coupling and driving induced resonant coupling. We describe the system using a reaction-coordinate mapping in combination with Floquet-Born-Markov theory and characterize its performance.",
