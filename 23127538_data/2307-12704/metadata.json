  "abstract": "Gentzen designed his natural deduction proof system to ``come as close as possible to actual reasoning.''  Indeed, natural deduction proofs closely resemble the static structure of logical reasoning in mathematical arguments.  However, different features of inference are compelling to capture when one wants to support the process of searching for proofs.  PSF (Proof Search Framework) attempts to capture these features naturally and directly.  The design and metatheory of PSF are presented, and its ability to specify a range of proof systems for classical, intuitionistic, and linear logic is illustrated.",
