  "abstract": "Let $Σ$ be a surface of negative Euler characteristic, homeomorphic to a closed surface, possibly with a finite number of points removed. In this paper, we present a construction method for a wide range of examples of geometric transition from hyperbolic to Anti-de Sitter structures via Half-pipe geometry on $Σ\\times\\mathbb{S}^1$, with cone singularities along a link. The main ingredient lies in studying the deformation of a convex core structure as the bending laminations of the upper and lower boundary components of the convex core uniformly collapse to zero.",
