    abstract = "{We present a Chandra study of 38 X-ray-luminous clusters of galaxies in the ROSAT Brightest Cluster Sample (BCS) that lie at moderate redshifts (z ≈ 0.15–0.4). Based primarily on power ratios and temperature maps, we find that the majority of clusters at moderate redshift generally have smooth, relaxed morphologies with some evidence for mild substructure perhaps indicative of recent minor merger activity. Using spatially resolved spectral analyses, we find that cool cores appear still to be common at moderate redshift. At a radius of 50 kpc, we find that at least 55 per cent of the clusters in our sample exhibit signs of mild cooling (tcool \\&lt; 10 Gyr), while in the central bin at least 34 per cent demonstrate signs of strong cooling (tcool \\&lt; 2 Gyr). These percentages are nearly identical to those found for luminous, low-redshift clusters of galaxies, indicating that there appears to be little evolution in cluster cores since z ≈ 0.4 and suggesting that heating and cooling mechanisms may already have stabilized by this epoch. Comparing the central cooling times to catalogues of central Hα emission in BCS clusters, we find a strong correspondence between the detection of Hα and central cooling time. We also confirm a strong correlation between the central cooling time and cluster power ratios, indicating that crude morphological measures can be used as a proxy for more rigorous analysis in the face of limited signal-to-noise ratio data. Finally, we find that the central temperatures for our sample typically drop by no more than a factor of ∼3–4 from the peak cluster temperatures, similar to those of many nearby clusters.}",

abstract="The galaxies located at the centers of clusters of galaxies are the most luminous stellar systems in the universe, and explaining the origin of these remarkable objects is a major challenge for any comprehensive theory of galaxy formation. One possibility is that central galaxies are made by a series of mergers of cluster galaxies that have spiraled to the bottom of the cluster potential well through dynamical friction. However, the resulting rate of accumulation of luminosity at the cluster center appears to be too slow---by more than a factor of two---to produce central galaxies with the luminosities observed, at least in virialized clusters similar to those we see today. A related possibility is that central galaxies are formed before the cluster virializes, during the early stages of hierarchical clustering when the relative velocities of the galaxies are low enough that merging can occur in pair wise galaxy encounters. However, so far there are no convincing numerical models of hierarchical clustering in which the most massive stellar systems formed resemble observed central galaxies. The evidence for recent merging in central galaxies is still difficult to interpret: multiple nuclei in central galaxies do not provide direct evidence for merging, as most are simply projected cluster members, but there is strong circumstantial evidence that dumbbell galaxies are the ex-central galaxies from two recently merged clusters that will themselves merge in about 0.2 Hubble times.",

   abstract = {We report on the analysis of a suite of smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations (in-corporating cooling and star formation) of mergers involving idealized X-ray clusters whose initial conditions resemble relaxed clusters with cool compact cores observed by Chandra and XMM. The simulations sample the most-interesting, theoretically plausible, range of impact parameters and progenitor mass ratios. We find that all mergers evolve via a common progression. We illustrate this progression in the projected gas density, X-ray surface brightness, Sunyaev-Zel'dovich, temperature, and gas-entropy maps. Several different classes of transient 'cold front' like features can arise over the course of a merger. Each class is distinguished by a distinct morphological signature and physical cause. We find that all these classes are present in Chandra and XMM observations of merging systems and propose a naming scheme for these features: 'comet-like' tails, bridges, plumes, streams and edges. In none of the cases considered do the initial cool compact cores of the primary and the secondary get destroyed during the course of the mergers. Instead, the two remnant cores eventually combine to form a new core that, depending on the final mass of the remnant, can have a greater cooling efficiency than either of its progenitors. We quantify the evolving morphology of our mergers using centroid variance, power ratios and offset between the X-ray and the projected mass maps. We find that the centroid variance best captures the dynamical state of the cluster. It also provides an excellent indicator of how far the system is from virial and hydrostatic equilibrium. Placing the system at z = 0.1, we find that all easily identified observable traces of the secondary disappear from a simulated 50-ks Chandra image following the second pericentric passage. The system, however, takes an additional ∼2 Gyr to relax and virialize. Observationally, the only reliable indicator of a system in this state is the smoothness of its X-ray surface brightness isophotes, not temperature fluctuations. Temperature fluctuations at the level of ΔT/T ∼ 20 per cent, can persist in the final systems well past the point of virialization, suggesting that the existence of temperature fluctuations, in and of themselves, does not necessarily indicate a disturbed or unrelaxed system. © 2006 RAS.},

   abstract = {Aims. We investigate the detection of Cool Cores (CCs) in the distant galaxy cluster population with the purpose of measuring the CC fraction out to redshift . Using a sample of nearby clusters spanning a wide range of morphologies, we define criteria to characterize cool cores, which are applicable to the high-redshift sample. Methods. We analyzed azimuthally-averaged surface brightness (SB) profiles with the known scaling relations, and we fitted single/double models to the data. Additionally, we measured a surface brightness concentration, , as the ratio of the peak over the ambient SB. To verify that this is an unbiased parameter as a function of redshift, we developed a model independent "cloning" technique to simulate the nearby clusters as they would appear at the same redshifts and luminosities as those in the distant sample. This method is based on the application of the cosmological surface brightness dimming to high-resolution Chandra images, assuming no intrinsic cluster evolution. We obtained a more physical parameterization of the CC presence by computing the cooling time at a radius of 20 kpc from the cluster center.Results. The distribution of the SB concentration and the stacked radial profiles of the low- sample, combined with published information on the CC properties of these clusters, show 3 degrees of SB cuspiness: non-CC, moderate, and strong CC. The same analysis applied to the high- clusters reveals two regimes: non-CC and moderate CC. The cooling time distribution corroborates this result by showing a strong negative correlation with . Conclusions. Our analysis indicates a significant fraction of distant clusters harboring a moderate CC out to , similar to those found in the local sample. The absence of strong cooling is likely linked with a higher merger rate expected at redshift z> 0.7, and should also be related to the shorter age of distant clusters, implying less time to develop a cool core. © 2008 ESO.},

abstract="Clusters of galaxies generally form by the gravitational merger of smaller clusters and groups. Major cluster mergers are the most energetic events in the Universe since the Big Bang. Some of the basic physical properties of mergers will be discussed, with an emphasis on simple analytic arguments rather than numerical simulations. Semi-analytic estimates of merger rates are reviewed, and a simple treatment of the kinematics of binary mergers is given. Mergers drive shocks into the intracluster medium, and these shocks heat the gas and should also accelerate nonthermal relativistic particles. X-ray observations of shocks can be used to determine the geometry and kinematics of the merger. Many clusters contain cooling flow cores; the hydrodynamical interactions of these cores with the hotter, less dense gas during mergers are discussed. As a result of particle acceleration in shocks, clusters of galaxies should contain very large populations of relativistic electrons and ions. Electrons with Lorentz factors $\gamma$∼300 (energiesE=$\gamma$mec2∼150 MeV) are expected to be particularly common. Observations and models for the radio, extreme ultraviolet, hard X-ray, and gamma-ray emission from nonthermal particles accelerated in these mergers are described.",

Using dark matter-only simulations, we identify the optimal separator to be λDS = 3.424. We test this same criterion on two sets of fully hydrodynamical The Three Hundred runs (Gadget-X and GIZMO-SIMBA), and find only a weak dependence on the input baryonic physics. We correlate the evolution of λDS with the mass accretion history and find that halo mass changes of \\$\\frac\\{\\Delta M\_\\{200\\}\\}\\{M\_\\{200\\}\\} \\lesssim 0.12\\$ do not typically alter the dynamical state.

    abstract = "{We present the results of a simple but robust morphological classification of a statistically complete sample of 108 of the most X-ray-luminous clusters at 0.15 ≤z≤ 0.7 observed with Chandra. Our aims are to (a) identify the most disturbed massive clusters to be used as gravitational lenses for studies of the distant Universe and as probes of particle acceleration mechanisms resulting in non-thermal radio emission; (b) find cluster mergers featuring subcluster trajectories that make them suitable for quantitative analyses of cluster collisions; and (c) constrain the evolution with redshift of the cluster merger fraction. Finally, (d) this paper represents the third public release of clusters from the MAssive Cluster Survey sample, adding 24 clusters to the 46 published previously. To classify clusters by the degree of relaxation, we use the projected offset of the brightest cluster galaxy from the peak (or the global centroid) of the X-ray emission as a measure of the segregation between the intracluster gas and dark matter, and also perform a visual assessment of the optical and X-ray morphology on all scales. Regarding (a), we identify 10 complex systems likely to have undergone multiple merger events in the recent past. Regarding (b), we identify 11 systems likely to be post-collision, binary, head-on mergers (BHOMs), as well as another six mergers that are possible BHOMs but probably harder to interpret because of non-negligible impact parameters and merger axes closer to our line of sight. Regarding (c), we find a highly significant increase with redshift in the fraction of morphologically disturbed clusters (and thus a clear decrease in the number of fully relaxed systems) starting at z∼ 0.4, in spite of a detection bias in our sample against very disturbed systems at high redshift. Since our morphological diagnostics are all based on imaging data and thus sensitive to projection effects, the measured merger fractions should be considered lower limits and our list of mergers incomplete, as we are likely to miss systems forming along axes close to our line of sight. A larger sample of clusters with high-quality X-ray data in particular at high redshift will be needed to trace the evolutionary history of cluster growth and relaxation closer to the primary epoch of cluster formation z∼ 1.}",

abstract = {We present first results on the cooling properties derived from Chandra X-ray observations of 83 high-redshift (0.3 &lt; z &lt; 1.2) massive galaxy clusters selected by their Sunyaev–Zel'dovich signature in the South Pole Telescope data. We measure each cluster's central cooling time, central entropy, and mass deposition rate, and compare these properties to those for local cluster samples. We find no significant evolution from z ∼ 0 to z ∼ 1 in the distribution of these properties, suggesting that cooling in cluster cores is stable over long periods of time. We also find that the average cool core entropy profile in the inner ∼100 kpc has not changed dramatically since z ∼ 1, implying that feedback must be providing nearly constant energy injection to maintain the observed “entropy floor” at ∼10 keV cm2. While the cooling properties appear roughly constant over long periods of time, we observe strong evolution in the gas density profile, with the normalized central density (ρg, 0/ρcrit) increasing by an order of magnitude from z ∼ 1 to z ∼ 0. When using metrics defined by the inner surface brightness profile of clusters, we find an apparent lack of classical, cuspy, cool-core clusters at z &gt; 0.75, consistent with earlier reports for clusters at z &gt; 0.5 using similar definitions. Our measurements indicate that cool cores have been steadily growing over the 8 Gyr spanned by our sample, consistent with a constant, ∼150 M☉ yr−1 cooling flow that is unable to cool below entropies of 10 keV cm2 and, instead, accumulates in the cluster center. We estimate that cool cores began to assemble in these massive systems at , which represents the first constraints on the onset of cooling in galaxy cluster cores. At high redshift (z ≳ 0.75), galaxy clusters may be classified as “cooling flows” (low central entropy, cooling time) but not “cool cores” (cuspy surface brightness profile), meaning that care must be taken when classifying these high-z systems. We investigate several potential biases that could conspire to mimic this cool core evolution and are unable to find a bias that has a similar redshift dependence and a substantial amplitude.}

We identify this substructure as most likely the remnant core of a merging group which has passed pericentre and responsible for triggering a cold front in the cluster core. We define two samples to represent two different environments within A1664 in accordance with the location of the substructure. We apply a morphological analysis using concentration–asymmetry–clumpiness, M20 and Gini to these samples to deduce if there has been any significant effect on the cluster galaxies due to this interaction. We find that there are more asymmetric galaxies found in the inner sample (at the 3.7σ level) which are likely due to galaxy–galaxy interactions as the merging group passed through core passage. No other differences were found between the inner and outer cluster in our morphological analysis, which we attribute to the limited resolution of our imagery. The colour profiles of the galaxies are found to be consistent with the morphology–density relation suggesting that there is no unique environmental effect in A1664 that has enhanced galaxy transformations. This study favours the star formation of cluster galaxies being quenched well before they are able to interact with the merging group and demonstrates that a minor cluster merger has little effect on the observable parameters of cluster galaxies such as morphology and colour.}",

title = {On the Origin of the Scatter in the Red Sequence: An Analysis of Four CLASH Clusters},
journal = {\apj},
abstract = {In clusters of galaxies, the red sequence is believed to be a consequence of a correlation between stellar mass and chemical abundances, with more massive galaxies being more metal-rich and, as a consequence, redder. However, there is a color scatter around the red sequence that holds even with precision photometry, implying that the galaxy population is more complicated than as described by a mass–metallicity relation. We use precision photometry from the Cluster Lensing and Supernova survey with Hubble (CLASH) to investigate what drives this scatter. In four CLASH clusters at z = 0.355 ± 0.007, we find that the optical–IR galaxy colors confirm the previously known trend of metallicity along the red sequence but also show a strong connection between stellar age and red sequence offset, with ages ranging from 3 to 8 Gyr. Starting with fixed-age color–magnitude relations motivated by the mass–metallicity correlations of CLASH cluster galaxies, and by adjusting galaxy colors through stellar population models to put them all at the age of our red sequence, we are able to reduce the, e.g., F625W–F814W scatter from 0.051 to 0.026 mag with median photometric errors of 0.029 mag. While we will extend this analysis to the full CLASH sample, in four clusters our technique already provides a color precision in near-total-light apertures to resolve the spread in stellar population formation ages that drives the scatter in the red sequence.}

title = {THE BLANCO COSMOLOGY SURVEY: DATA ACQUISITION, PROCESSING, CALIBRATION, QUALITY DIAGNOSTICS, AND DATA RELEASE},
journal = {\apj},
abstract = {The Blanco Cosmology Survey (BCS) is a 60 night imaging survey of ∼80 deg2 of the southern sky located in two fields: (α, δ) = (5 hr, −55°) and (23 hr, −55°). The survey was carried out between 2005 and 2008 in griz bands with the Mosaic2 imager on the Blanco 4 m telescope. The primary aim of the BCS survey is to provide the data required to optically confirm and measure photometric redshifts for Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect selected galaxy clusters from the South Pole Telescope and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope. We process and calibrate the BCS data, carrying out point-spread function-corrected model-fitting photometry for all detected objects. The median 10σ galaxy (point-source) depths over the survey in griz are approximately 23.3 (23.9), 23.4 (24.0), 23.0 (23.6), and 21.3 (22.1), respectively. The astrometric accuracy relative to the USNO-B survey is ∼45 mas. We calibrate our absolute photometry using the stellar locus in grizJ bands, and thus our absolute photometric scale derives from the Two Micron All Sky Survey, which has ∼2% accuracy. The scatter of stars about the stellar locus indicates a systematic floor in the relative stellar photometric scatter in griz that is ∼1.9%, ∼2.2%, ∼2.7%, and ∼2.7%, respectively. A simple cut in the AstrOmatic star–galaxy classifier spread_model produces a star sample with good spatial uniformity. We use the resulting photometric catalogs to calibrate photometric redshifts for the survey and demonstrate scatter δz/(1 + z) = 0.054 with an outlier fraction η &lt; 5% to z ∼ 1. We highlight some selected science results to date and provide a full description of the released data products.}

journal = {\apjs},
abstract = {The combination of seven-year data from WMAP and improved astrophysical data rigorously tests the standard cosmological model and places new constraints on its basic parameters and extensions. By combining the WMAP data with the latest distance measurements from the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies and the Hubble constant (H0) measurement, we determine the parameters of the simplest six-parameter ΛCDM model. The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is ns = 0.968 ± 0.012 (68 CL) for this data combination, a measurement that excludes the Harrison–Zel'dovich–Peebles spectrum by 99.5 CL. The other parameters, including those beyond the minimal set, are also consistent with, and improved from, the five-year results. We find no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The seven-year temperature power spectrum gives a better determination of the third acoustic peak, which results in a better determination of the redshift of the matter-radiation equality epoch. Notable examples of improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos, ∑mν &lt; 0.58 eV(95 CL), and the effective number of neutrino species, Neff = 4.34+0.86−0.88 (68 CL), which benefit from better determinations of the third peak and H0. The limit on a constant dark energy equation of state parameter from WMAP+BAO+H0, without high-redshift Type Ia supernovae, is w = −1.10 ±  0.14 (68 CL). We detect the effect of primordial helium on the temperature power spectrum and provide a new test of big bang nucleosynthesis by measuring Yp = 0.326 ±  0.075 (68 CL). We detect, and show on the map for the first time, the tangential and radial polarization patterns around hot and cold spots of temperature fluctuations, an important test of physical processes at z = 1090 and the dominance of adiabatic scalar fluctuations. The seven-year polarization data have significantly improved: we now detect the temperature–E-mode polarization cross power spectrum at 21σ, compared with 13σ from the five-year data. With the seven-year temperature–B-mode cross power spectrum, the limit on a rotation of the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating effects has improved by 38 to  (68 CL). We report significant detections of the Sunyaev–Zel'dovich (SZ) effect at the locations of known clusters of galaxies. The measured SZ signal agrees well with the expected signal from the X-ray data on a cluster-by-cluster basis. However, it is a factor of 0.5–0.7 times the predictions from “universal profile” of Arnaud et al., analytical models, and hydrodynamical simulations. We find, for the first time in the SZ effect, a significant difference between the cooling-flow and non-cooling-flow clusters (or relaxed and non-relaxed clusters), which can explain some of the discrepancy. This lower amplitude is consistent with the lower-than-theoretically expected SZ power spectrum recently measured by the South Pole Telescope Collaboration.}

	abstract = {We derive and compare the fractions of cool-core clusters in the Planck Early Sunyaev–Zel’dovich sample of 164 clusters with and in a flux-limited X-ray sample of 100 clusters with , using Chandra observations. We use four metrics to identify cool-core clusters: (1) the concentration parameter, which is the ratio of the integrated emissivity profile within 0.15 r500 to that within r500; (2) the ratio of the integrated emissivity profile within 40 kpc to that within 400 kpc; (3) the cuspiness of the gas density profile, which is the negative of the logarithmic derivative of the gas density with respect to the radius, measured at 0.04 r500; and (4) the central gas density, measured at 0.01 r500. We find that the sample of X-ray-selected clusters, as characterized by each of these metrics, contains a significantly larger fraction of cool-core clusters compared to the sample of SZ-selected clusters (44% ± 7% versus 28% ± 4% using the concentration parameter in the 0.15–1.0 r500 range, 61% ± 8% versus 36% ± 5% using the concentration parameter in the 40–400 kpc range, 64% ± 8% versus 38% ± 5% using the cuspiness, and 53% ± 7% versus 39 ± 5% using the central gas density). Qualitatively, cool-core clusters are more X-ray luminous at fixed mass. Hence, our X-ray, flux-limited sample, compared to the approximately mass-limited SZ sample, is overrepresented with cool-core clusters. We describe a simple quantitative model that uses the excess luminosity of cool-core clusters compared to non-cool-core clusters at fixed mass to successfully predict the observed fraction of cool-core clusters in X-ray-selected samples.}

We exploit deep Hubble Space Telescope ACS imaging in the F555W and F814W passbands of the central 1.2 Mpc diameter regions of the distant clusters to measure precise colors for the galaxies in these regions and statistically correct for contamination by field galaxies using observations of blank fields. We apply an identical analysis to ground-based photometry of the z ~ 0.1 sample. This comparison demonstrates that the number of faint, MV ~ -19, red galaxies relative to the bright population seen in the central regions of massive clusters has roughly doubled over the 4 Gyr between z ~ 0.5 and z ~ 0.1. We quantify this difference by measuring the dwarf-giant ratio on the red sequence, which increases by a factor of at least 2.2 ± 0.4 since z ~ 0.5. This is consistent with the idea that many faint, blue, star-forming galaxies in high-density environments are transforming onto the red sequence in the last half of the Hubble time.}

	title = {The Evolution of Early-Type Galaxies in Distant Clusters},
	journal = {\apj},
	abstract = {We present results from an optical-infrared photometric study of early-type (E+S0) galaxies in 19 galaxy clusters out to z = 0.9. The galaxy sample is selected on the basis of morphologies determined from Hubble Space Telescope (HST) WFPC2 images and is photometrically defined in the K band in order to minimize redshift-dependent selection biases. Using new ground-based photometry in five optical and infrared bands for each cluster, we examine the evolution of the color-magnitude relation for early-type cluster galaxies, considering its slope, intercept, and color scatter around the mean relation. New multiwavelength photometry of galaxies in the Coma Cluster is used to provide a baseline sample at z ≈ 0 with which to compare the distant clusters. The optical-IR colors of the early-type cluster galaxies become bluer with increasing redshift in a manner consistent with the passive evolution of an old stellar population formed at an early cosmic epoch. The degree of color evolution is similar for clusters at similar redshift and does not depend strongly on the optical richness or X-ray luminosity of the cluster, which suggests that the history of early-type galaxies is relatively insensitive to environment, at least above a certain density threshold. The slope of the color-magnitude relationship shows no significant change out to z = 0.9, which provides evidence that it arises from a correlation between galaxy mass and metallicity, not age. Finally, the intrinsic scatter in the optical-IR colors of the galaxies is small and nearly constant with redshift, which indicates that the majority of giant, early-type galaxies in clusters share a common star formation history, with little perturbation due to uncorrelated episodes of later star formation. Taken together, our results are consistent with models in which most early-type galaxies in rich clusters are old, formed the majority of their stars at high redshift in a well-synchronized fashion, and evolved quiescently thereafter. We consider several possible effects that may be introduced by the choice of morphologically recognizable elliptical and S0 galaxies in dense environments as a subject for study. In particular, the inclusion of S0 galaxies, which might be undergoing morphological transformation in clusters as part of the Butcher-Oemler effect, may influence the results of our investigation.}

The characteristic magnitude M* evolves passively out to z = 0.6, while the faint-end slope of the luminosity function is α ∼ −1 at all redshifts. Cluster galaxies must have been completely assembled down to MI ∼ −18 out to z = 0.6. We observe tight colour–magnitude relations over a luminosity range of up to 8 mag., consistent with the passive evolution of ancient stellar populations. This is found in all clusters, irrespective of their dynamical status (involved in a collision or not, or even within subclusters for the same object), and suggests that environment does not have a strong influence on galaxy properties. A red sequence luminosity function can be followed to the limits of our photometry: we see no evidence of a weakening of the red sequence to z = 0.6. The blue galaxy fraction rises with redshift, especially at fainter absolute magnitudes. We observe bright blue galaxies in clusters at z \\&gt; 0.4 that are not encountered locally.

The color-magnitude relation was determined from Advanced Camera for Surveys imaging in the WFC F775W (i\_775) and F850LP (z\_850) filters combined with ground-based spectroscopy. Early-type cluster candidates have been identified according to the Postman et al. morphological classification. In both clusters the bright red early-type population defines a tight color-magnitude relation very similar in color, although the two clusters present different X-ray luminosities and shapes, with RX J0849+4452 being three times more X-ray luminous and more compact, and having a temperature two times higher. The elliptical galaxy color-magnitude relations (CMR) in RX J0849+4452 and RX J0848+4453 show an intrinsic (i\_775-z\_850) color scatter of 0.026 +/- 0.012 mag and 0.024 +/- 0.015 mag, respectively, within 2 arcminutes (\textbackslashtextasciitilde1Mpc at z=1.26) from the cluster X-ray emission centers. Simple modeling of the scatters using stellar population models from Bruzual and Charlot, gives a mean luminosity-weighted age t > 2.5 Gyr (z\_f > 2.75). S0 galaxies follow the elliptical CMR; they show larger scatters about the CMR. The intrinsic scatter decreases and the CMR slopes are steeper at smaller radii, within both clusters. We conclude that old stellar populations in cluster elliptical galaxies are already in place at z=1.26, both in the more evolved cluster RX J0849+4452, and in its less evolved companion RX J0848+4453. Even at a lookback time of 9 Gyr, in the early merging and buildup of massive clusters, the bulk of the stellar content of the bright elliptical galaxy population was in place - apparently formed some 2.5\textbackslashtextasciitildeGyr earlier at z\textbackslashtextasciitilde3}},

We select galaxies based on morphological classifications extending about 3.5 mag down the galaxy luminosity function, augmented by spectroscopic membership information. At the core of the cluster is an extensive early-type galaxy population surrounding a central pair of galaxies that show signs of dynamical interaction. The early-type population defines a tight sequence in the CM diagram, with an intrinsic scatter in observed (i-z) of \$0.029\textbackslashpm0.007\$ mag based on 52 galaxies, or \$0.024\textbackslashpm0.008\$ mag for \$\textbackslashsim30\$ ellipticals. Simulations using the latest stellar population models indicate an age scatter for the ellipticals of about 34\%, with a mean age \$\textbackslashtaul\textbackslashgta2.6\$ Gyr (corresponding to \$z\_L\textbackslashgta2.7\$), and the last star formation occurring at \$z\_\{end\}\textbackslashgta1.5\$. Transforming to rest-frame \$(U-B)\$, we conclude that the slope and scatter in the CM relation for morphologically selected early-type galaxies show little or no evidence for evolution out to \$z\textbackslashapprox1.2\$.

abstract = {{Using galaxy clusters from the ESO Distant Cluster Survey, we study how the distribution of galaxies along the colour-magnitude relation has evolved since z\textbackslashtextasciitilde0.8. While red-sequence galaxies in all these clusters are well described by an old, passively evolving population, we confirm our previous finding of a significant evolution in their luminosity distribution as a function of redshift. When compared to galaxy clusters in the local Universe, the high redshift EDisCS clusters exhibit a significant "deficit" of faint red galaxies. Combining clusters in three different redshift bins, and defining as `faint' all galaxies in the range 0.4 > L/L* > 0.1, we find a clear decrease in the luminous-to-faint ratio of red galaxies from z\textbackslashtextasciitilde0.8 to z\textbackslashtextasciitilde0.4. The amount of such a decrease appears to be in qualitative agreement with predictions of a model where the blue bright galaxies that populate the colour-magnitude diagram of high redshift clusters, have their star formation suppressed by the hostile cluster environment. Although model results need to be interpreted with caution, our findings clearly indicate that the red-sequence population of high-redshift clusters does not contain all progenitors of nearby red-sequence cluster galaxies. A significant fraction of these must have moved onto the red-sequence below z\textbackslashtextasciitilde0.8.}},

At face value, the number density of blue galaxies has remained roughly constant since \$ z = 1\$, whereas that of red galaxies has been rising. Luminosity densities support both conclusions, but we note that most red-galaxy evolution occurs between our data and local surveys and in our highest redshift bin, where the data are weakest. We discuss the implications of having most red galaxies emerge after \$z = 1\$ from precursors among the blue population, taking into account the properties of local and distant E/S0s. We suggest a ``mixed'' scenario in which some blue galaxies have their star-formation quenched in gas-rich mergers, migrate to the red sequence with a variety of masses, and merge further on the red sequence in one or more purely stellar mergers. E/S0s of a given mass today will have formed via different routes, in a manner that may help to explain the fundamental plane and other local scaling laws.}},

However, they are not distant outliers from the Fundamental Plane and mass-to-light scaling relations defined by the bulk of the early-type galaxy population. They may host the most massive black holes in the Universe, and their abundance and properties can be used to constrain galaxy formation models. Clear outliers from the scaling relations tend to be objects in superposition (angular separations smaller than 1 arcsec), evidence for which comes sometimes from the spectra, sometimes from the images, and sometimes from both. The statistical properties of the superposed pairs, e.g., the distribution of pair separations and velocity dispersions, can be used to provide useful information about the expected distribution of image multiplicities, separations and flux ratios due to gravitational lensing by multiple lenses, and may also constrain models of their interaction rates.}},

abstract = {{We present a study of the optical properties of the 26 most massive galaxy clusters within the South Pole Telescope Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SPT-SZ) 2500 deg2 survey spanning the redshift range 0.10 < z < 1.13. We measure the radial profiles, the luminosity functions (LFs), and the halo occupation numbers (HONs) using optical data of typical depth m* + 2. The stacked radial profiles are consistent with a Navarro–Frenk–White profile of concentration |\$2.84\textasciicircum\{+0.40\}\_\{-0.37\}\$| for the red sequence (RS) and |\$2.36\textasciicircum\{+0.38\}\_\{-0.35\}\$| for the total population. Stacking the data in multiple redshift bins shows slight redshift evolution in the concentration when both the total population is used, and when only RS galaxies are used (at 2.1σ and 2.8σ, respectively). The stacked LF shows a faint end slope |\$\textbackslashalpha = -1.06\textasciicircum\{+0.04\}\_\{-0.03\}\$| for the total and |\$\textbackslashalpha = -0.80\textasciicircum\{+0.04\}\_\{-0.03\}\$| for the RS population. The redshift evolution of m* is consistent with a passively evolving composite stellar population (CSP) model. Adopting the CSP model predictions, we explore the redshift evolution of the Schechter parameters α and ϕ*. We find α for the total population to be consistent with no evolution (0.3σ), and mildly significant evidence of evolution for the red galaxies (1.1–2.1σ). The data show that the density ϕ*/E2(z) decreases with redshift, in tension with the self-similar expectation at a 2.4σ level for the total population. The measured HON–mass relation has a lower normalization than previous low redshift studies. Finally, our data support HON redshift evolution at a 2.1σ level, with clusters at higher redshift containing fewer galaxies than their low-z counterparts.}},

Using clusters selected by the South Pole Telescope survey and deep multiband optical data from the Blanco Cosmology Survey, we measure the radial profile, the luminosity function, the blue fraction and the halo occupation number of the galaxy populations of these four clusters with redshifts ranging from 0.3 to 1. Our goal is to understand whether there are differences among the galaxy populations of these SZE selected clusters and previously studied clusters selected in the optical and the X-ray. The radial distributions of galaxies in the four systems are consistent with NFW profiles with a galaxy concentration of 3 to 6. We show that the characteristic luminosities in \$griz\$ bands are consistent with passively evolving populations emerging from a single burst at redshift \$z=3\$. The faint end power law slope of the luminosity function is found to be on average \$\textbackslashalpha \textbackslashapprox -1.2\$ in griz. Halo occupation numbers (to \$m\textasciicircum*+2\$) for these systems appear to be consistent with those based on X-ray selected clusters. The blue fraction estimated to \$0.36L\textasciicircum*\$, for the three lower redshift systems, suggests an increase with redshift, although with the current sample the uncertainties are still large. Overall, this pilot study of the first four clusters provides no evidence that the galaxy populations in these systems differ significantly from those in previously studied cluster populations selected in the X-ray or the optical.}},

abstract = {{We present a new cluster-detection algorithm designed for the Panoramic Survey Telescope and Rapid Response System (Pan-STARRS) survey but with generic application to any multiband data. The method makes no prior assumptions about the properties of clusters other than (i) the similarity in colour of cluster galaxies (the ‘red sequence’); and (ii) an enhanced projected surface density. The detector has three main steps: (i) it identifies cluster members by photometrically filtering the input catalogue to isolate galaxies in colour–magnitude space; (ii) a Voronoi diagram identifies regions of high surface density; and (iii) galaxies are grouped into clusters with a Friends-of-Friends technique. Where multiple colours are available, we require systems to exhibit sequences in two colours. In this paper, we present the algorithm and demonstrate it on two data sets. The first is a 7-deg2 sample of the deep Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) equatorial stripe (Stripe 82), from which we detect 97 clusters with z≤ 0.6. Benefitting from deeper data, we are 100 per cent complete in the maxBCG optically selected cluster catalogue (based on shallower single-epoch SDSS data) and find an additional 78 previously unidentified clusters. The second data set is a mock Medium Deep Survey Pan-STARRS catalogue, based on the Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) model and a semi-analytic galaxy formation recipe. Knowledge of galaxy–halo memberships in the mock catalogue allows for the quantification of algorithm performance. We detect 305 mock clusters in haloes with mass >1013 h−1 M⊙ at z≲ 0.6 and determine a spurious detection rate of <1 per cent, consistent with tests on the Stripe 82 catalogue. The detector performs well in the recovery of model ΛCDM clusters. At the median redshift of the catalogue, the algorithm achieves >75 per cent completeness down to halo masses of 1013.4 h−1 M⊙ and recovers >75 per cent of the total stellar mass of clusters in haloes down to 1013.8 h−1 M⊙.

In this work, the red-sequence template is built using the broad-band optical+near infrared photometry of KiDS-VIKING and the overlapping spectroscopic data sets. The selection process involves estimating the red-sequence redshifts, assessing the purity of the sample, and estimating the underlying redshift distributions of redshift bins. After performing the selection, we mitigate the impact of survey properties on the observed number density of galaxies by assigning photometric weights to the galaxies. We measure the angular two-point correlation function of the red galaxies in four redshift bins, and constrain the large scale bias of our red-sequence sample assuming a fixed \$\textbackslashLambda\$CDM cosmology.

abstract = {{Formation of galaxy clusters corresponds to the collapse of the largest gravitationally bound overdensities in the initial density field and is accompanied by the most energetic phenomena since the Big Bang and by the complex interplay between gravity-induced dynamics of collapse and baryonic processes associated with galaxy formation. Galaxy clusters are, thus, at the cross-roads of cosmology and astrophysics and are unique laboratories for testing models of gravitational structure formation, galaxy evolution, thermodynamics of the intergalactic medium, and plasma physics. At the same time, their large masses make them a useful probe of growth of structure over cosmological time, thus providing cosmological constraints that are complementary to other probes. In this review, we describe our current understanding of cluster formation: from the general picture of collapse from initial density fluctuations in an expanding Universe to detailed simulations of cluster formation including the effects of galaxy formation. We outline both the areas in which highly accurate predictions of theoretical models can be obtained and areas where predictions are uncertain due to uncertain physics of galaxy formation and feedback. The former includes the description of the structural properties of the dark matter halos hosting clusters, their mass function, and clustering properties. Their study provides a foundation for cosmological applications of clusters and for testing the fundamental assumptions of the standard model of structure formation. The latter includes the description of the total gas and stellar fractions and the thermodynamical and nonthermal processes in the intracluster plasma. Their study serves as a testing ground for galaxy formation models and plasma physics. In this context, we identify a suitable radial range where the observed thermal properties of the intracluster plasma exhibit the most regular behavior and, thus, can be used to define robust observational proxies for the total cluster mass. Finally, we discuss the formation of clusters in nonstandard cosmological models, such as non-Gaussian models for the initial density field and models with modified gravity, along with prospects for testing these alternative scenarios with large cluster surveys in the near future.}},

abstract = {{The most successful cosmological models to date envision structure formation as a hierarchical process in which gravity is constantly drawing lumps of matter together to form increasingly larger structures. Clusters of galaxies currently sit atop this hierarchy as the largest objects that have had time to collapse under the influence of their own gravity. Thus their appearance on the cosmic scene is also relatively recent. Two features of clusters make them uniquely useful tracers of cosmic evolution. First, clusters are the biggest things whose masses we can reliably measure because they are the largest objects to have undergone gravitational relaxation and entered into virial equilibrium. Mass measurements of nearby clusters can therefore be used to determine the amount of structure in the universe on scales of 1014–1015M☉, and comparisons of the present-day cluster mass distribution with the mass distribution at earlier times can be used to measure the rate of structure formation, placing important constraints on cosmological models. Second, clusters are essentially “closed boxes” that retain all their gaseous matter, despite the enormous energy input associated with supernovae and active galactic nuclei, because the gravitational potential wells of clusters are so deep. The baryonic component of clusters therefore contains a wealth of information about the processes associated with galaxy formation, including the efficiency with which baryons are converted into stars and the effects of the resulting feedback processes on galaxy formation. This article reviews our theoretical understanding of both the dark-matter component and the baryonic component of clusters, providing a context for interpreting the flood of new cluster observations that are now arriving from the latest generation of x-ray observatories, large optical surveys, and measurements of cluster-induced distortions in the spectrum of the cosmic microwave background.}},

    abstract = "{We have undertaken a detailed comparison of the colours of early-type galaxies in the Virgo and Coma clusters. In Paper I (this issue), we presented our system of homogeneous U,V,J and K photometric measurements for these galaxies. In this paper, we use this data set to investigate the universality of the colour–magnitude correlation. Our work reassesses the anomaly noted by Aaronson, Persson \\&amp; Frogel. Following these authors, we initially compare the relative distances of the two clusters derived from the L – σ and U – V and V – K colour–magnitude correlations. However, in contrast to their result, we find that all three relations give compatible relative distance moduli: \\$\\Delta \\{m\\}\_\\{U-V\\}=4.01\\pm 0.20,\\,\\Delta \\{m\\}\_\\{V-K\\} =3.58\\pm 0.23,\\,\\Delta \\{m\\}\_\\{L-\\sigma \\} =3.62\\pm 0.16.\\$ A similar result is found by correlating the colours and velocity dispersions with photometric diameters. Again, we find that all three comparisons give consistent distance estimates: \\$\\Delta \\{m\\}\_\\{U-V \\} =3.87\\pm 0.15,\\,\\Delta \\{m\\}\_\\{V-K \\} =3.42\\pm 0.21,\\,\\Delta \\{m\\}\_\\{D-\\sigma \\} =3.67\\pm 0.11,\\$ with a mean relative distance modulus of \\$3.69\\pm 0.08.\\$ These results show that the colour–magnitude relation has the same form in both Coma and Virgo. An alternative approach is to compare, the colours of the galaxies directly through the distance- independent correlation between colour and velocity dispersion. We find that the median colours are offset by \\$-0.009 \\pm 0.012(U-V), 0.005 \\pm 0.016 (V-K) \\,\\text\\{and\\} -0.038 \\pm 0.012 (J-K),\\$ with an estimated systematic error of 0.02, 0.03 and 0.04 mag in each case. All of these offsets are therefore consistent with there being no intrinsic difference between the colours of early-type galaxies in Virgo and Coma. We conclude that the colour–magnitude relation has the same form in both clusters, and hence can provide a reliable cosmic distance estimator for clusters of galaxies, giving relative distances accurate to ~ 20 per cent per galaxy.In addition, our data constrain the intrinsic scatter of early-type galaxies about the mean colour–magnitude relation. We measure an rms scatter of typically 0.05 mag, of which ~ 0.03 mag can be accounted for by observational error. By examining the correlation of residuals, we show that this intrinsic variation is unlikely to be dominated by differences in the star formation histories of elliptical galaxies. We use the stellar population synthesis model of Bruzual to quantify the implications of this result. First, we present simple time-scale arguments to suggest that the spheroidal components of early-type galaxies are unlikely to have formed below a redshift of \\$2(\\{q\\}\_\\{0\\} = 0.5).\\$ Secondly, we show that our data are only marginally consistent with the strong bursts of star formation required to explain the spectra of galaxies in moderate-redshift clusters.}",

By using the bright member galaxies of a large sample of rich clusters identified from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, we obtain the bright end of composite luminosity functions of cluster galaxies, and study their dependence on cluster dynamical states. After a redshift-evolution correction of absolute magnitude, the luminosity function of member galaxies can be well fitted by a Schechter function when the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) are excluded. The absolute magnitudes of BCGs follow a Gaussian function with a characteristic width of about 0.36 mag. We find that the luminosity function of galaxies in more relaxed clusters has a fainter characteristic absolute magnitude (M*), and these clusters have fewer bright non-BCG member galaxies but a brighter BCG. Our results suggest the co-evolution of galaxy population with a cluster dynamical state and support the hierarchical formation scenario of the BCGs.}",

We present new spectroscopic confirmation for six of these high-redshift clusters, five of which are at z > 1.35. Using infrared luminosities measured with deep Spitzer/Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer observations at 24 μm, along with robust optical + IRAC photometric redshifts and spectral-energy-distribution-fitted stellar masses, we present the dust-obscured star-forming fractions, star formation rates, and specific star formation rates in these clusters as functions of redshift and projected clustercentric radius. We find that z ∼ 1.4 represents a transition redshift for the ISCS sample, with clear evidence of an unquenched era of cluster star formation at earlier times. Beyond this redshift, the fraction of star-forming cluster members increases monotonically toward the cluster centers. Indeed, the specific star formation rate in the cores of these distant clusters is consistent with field values at similar redshifts, indicating that at z > 1.4 environment-dependent quenching had not yet been established in ISCS clusters. By combining these observations with complementary studies showing a rapid increase in the active galactic nucleus (AGN) fraction, a stochastic star formation history, and a major merging episode at the same epoch in this cluster sample, we suggest that the starburst activity is likely merger-driven and that the subsequent quenching is due to feedback from merger-fueled AGNs. The totality of the evidence suggests we are witnessing the final quenching period that brings an end to the era of star formation in galaxy clusters and initiates the era of passive evolution.}

We are further able to show for our sample of 106 clusters that the distribution of gas in the ICM as a function of radial distance is well fitted by the dynamical mass distribution arising from our modified acceleration law without any additional dark matter component. In a previous work, we applied this theory to galaxy rotation curves and demonstrated good fits to our sample of 101 low surface brightness, high surface brightness and dwarf galaxies including 58 galaxies that were fitted photometrically with the single-parameter mass-to-light ratio (M/L)stars. The results obtained there were qualitatively similar to those obtained using Milgrom's phenomenological Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) model, although the determined galaxy masses were quantitatively different, and MOND does not show a return to Keplerian behaviour at extragalactic distances. The results obtained here are compared to those obtained using Milgrom's phenomenological MOND model which does not fit the X-ray galaxy cluster masses unless an auxiliary dark matter component is included.}",

We find that protoclusters are very extended, with 90 per cent of their mass spread across ∼35 h−1 Mpc comoving at z = 2 ( ∼ 30 arcmin). The ‘main halo’, which can manifest as a high-redshift cluster or group, is only a minor feature of the protocluster, containing less than 20 per cent of all protocluster galaxies at z = 2. Furthermore, many protoclusters do not contain a main halo that is massive enough to be identified as a high-redshift cluster. Protoclusters exist in a range of evolutionary states at high redshift, independent of the mass they will evolve to at z = 0. We show that the evolutionary state of a protocluster can be approximated by the mass ratio of the first and second most massive haloes within the protocluster, and the z = 0 mass of a protocluster can be estimated to within 0.2 dex accuracy if both the mass of the main halo and the evolutionary state are known. We also investigate the biases introduced by only observing star-forming protocluster members within small fields. The star formation rate required for line-emitting galaxies to be detected is typically high, which leads to the artificial loss of low-mass galaxies from the protocluster sample. This effect is stronger for observations of the centre of the protocluster, where the quenched galaxy fraction is higher. This loss of low-mass galaxies, relative to the field, distorts the size of the galaxy overdensity, which in turn can contribute to errors in predicting the z = 0 evolved mass.}",

	journal = {\aj},
	abstract = {Numerous methods for finding clusters at moderate to high redshifts have been proposed in recent years, at wavelengths ranging from radio to X-rays. In this paper we describe a new method for detecting clusters in two-band optical/near-IR imaging data. The method relies upon the observation that all rich clusters, at all redshifts observed so far, appear to have a red sequence of early-type galaxies. The emerging picture is that all rich clusters contain a core population of passively evolving elliptical galaxies that are coeval and formed at high redshifts. The proposed search method exploits this strong empirical fact by using the red sequence as a direct indicator of overdensity. The fundamental advantage of this approach is that with appropriate filters, cluster elliptical galaxies at a given redshift are redder than all normal galaxies at lower redshifts. A simple color cut thus virtually eliminates all foreground contamination, even at significant redshifts. In this paper, one of a series of two, we describe the underlying assumptions and basic techniques of the method in detail and contrast the method with those used by other authors. We provide a brief demonstration of the effectiveness of the technique using a real photometric sample with redshift data, and from this we conclude that the method offers a powerful yet simple way of identify galaxy clusters. We find that the method can reliably detect structures to masses as small as groups with velocity dispersions of only ∼300 km s-1, with redshifts for all detected structures estimated to an accuracy of ∼10%.}

	abstract = {We present first results on the cooling properties derived from Chandra X-ray observations of 83 high-redshift (0.3 < z < 1.2) massive galaxy clusters selected by their Sunyaev–Zel'dovich signature in the South Pole Telescope data. We measure each cluster's central cooling time, central entropy, and mass deposition rate, and compare these properties to those for local cluster samples. We find no significant evolution from z ∼ 0 to z ∼ 1 in the distribution of these properties, suggesting that cooling in cluster cores is stable over long periods of time. We also find that the average cool core entropy profile in the inner ∼100 kpc has not changed dramatically since z ∼ 1, implying that feedback must be providing nearly constant energy injection to maintain the observed “entropy floor” at ∼10 keV cm2. While the cooling properties appear roughly constant over long periods of time, we observe strong evolution in the gas density profile, with the normalized central density (ρg, 0/ρcrit) increasing by an order of magnitude from z ∼ 1 to z ∼ 0. When using metrics defined by the inner surface brightness profile of clusters, we find an apparent lack of classical, cuspy, cool-core clusters at z > 0.75, consistent with earlier reports for clusters at z > 0.5 using similar definitions. Our measurements indicate that cool cores have been steadily growing over the 8 Gyr spanned by our sample, consistent with a constant, ∼150 M☉ yr−1 cooling flow that is unable to cool below entropies of 10 keV cm2 and, instead, accumulates in the cluster center. We estimate that cool cores began to assemble in these massive systems at , which represents the first constraints on the onset of cooling in galaxy cluster cores. At high redshift (z  0.75), galaxy clusters may be classified as “cooling flows” (low central entropy, cooling time) but not “cool cores” (cuspy surface brightness profile), meaning that care must be taken when classifying these high-z systems. We investigate several potential biases that could conspire to mimic this cool core evolution and are unable to find a bias that has a similar redshift dependence and a substantial amplitude.}

	abstract = {We present a novel quantitative scheme of cluster classification based on the morphological properties that are manifested in X-ray images. We use a conventional radial surface brightness concentration parameter (cSB) as defined previously by others and a new asymmetry parameter, which we define in this paper. Our asymmetry parameter, which we refer to as photon asymmetry (Aphot), was developed as a robust substructure statistic for cluster observations with only a few thousand counts. To demonstrate that photon asymmetry exhibits better stability than currently popular power ratios and centroid shifts, we artificially degrade the X-ray image quality by (1) adding extra background counts, (2) eliminating a fraction of the counts, (3) increasing the width of the smoothing kernel, and (4) simulating cluster observations at higher redshift. The asymmetry statistic presented here has a smaller statistical uncertainty than competing substructure parameters, allowing for low levels of substructure to be measured with confidence. Aphot is less sensitive to the total number of counts than competing substructure statistics, making it an ideal candidate for quantifying substructure in samples of distant clusters covering a wide range of observational signal-to-noise ratios. Additionally, we show that the asymmetry-concentration classification separates relaxed, cool-core clusters from morphologically disturbed mergers, in agreement with by-eye classifications. Our algorithms, freely available as Python scripts (https://github.com/ndaniyar/aphot), are completely automatic and can be used to rapidly classify galaxy cluster morphology for large numbers of clusters without human intervention.}

   abstract = {Galaxies arrive on the red sequences of clusters at high redshift (z > 1) once their star formation is quenched and evolve passively thereafter. However, we have previously found that cluster red sequence galaxies (CRSGs) undergo significant morphological evolution subsequent to the cessation of star formation, at some point in the past 9-10 Gyr. Through a detailed study of a large sample of cluster red sequence galaxies spanning 0.2 < z < 1.4 we elucidate the details of this evolution. Below z ∼ 0.5-0.6 (in the last 5-6 Gyr) there is little or no morphological evolution in the population as a whole, unlike in the previous 4-5 Gyr. Over this earlier time (i) disc-like systems with Sérsic n < 2 progressively disappear, as (ii) the range of their axial ratios similarly decreases, removing the most elongated systems (those consistent with thin discs seen at an appreciable inclination angle) and (iii) radial colour gradients (bluer outwards) decrease in an absolute sense from significant age-related gradients to a residual level consistent with the metallicity-induced gradients seen in low-redshift cluster members. The distribution of their effective radii shows some evidence of evolution, consistent with growth of at most a factor <1.5 between z ∼ 1.4 and ∼0.5, significantly less than for comparable field galaxies, while the distribution of their central (<1 kpc) bulge surface densities shows no evolution at least at z < 1. A simple model involving the fading and thickening of a disc component after comparatively recent quenching (after z ∼ 1.5) around an otherwise passively evolving older spheroid component is consistent with all of these findings.},

   abstract = {© 2017 by the authors. Using 70 μm observations taken with the PACS instrument of the Herschel space telescope, the dust content of the nearby and interacting spiral galaxy NGC 3077 has been compared with the dust content of the isolated galaxies such as NGC 2841, NGC 3184 and NGC 3351. The dust content has allowed us to derive dust-to-gas ratios for the four spiral galaxies of our sample. We find that NGC 2841, NGC 3184 and NGC 3351 have dust masses of 6.5-9.1 times; 107 M⊙, which are a factor of ~10 higher than the value found for NGC 3077. This result shows that NGC 3077 is a dust deficient galaxy, as was expected, because this galaxy is affected by tidal interactions with its neighboring galaxies M81 and M82. NGC 3077 reveals a dust-to-gas ratio of 17.5%, much higher than the average ratio of 1.8% of the isolated galaxies, evidencing that NGC 3077 is also deficient in H2 + HI gas. Therefore, it seems that, in this galaxy, gas has been stripped more efficiently than dust.},

We present a study of diffuse extended ionized gas towards three clouds located in the Galactic Centre (GC). One line of sight (LOS) is towards the 20 km s −1 cloud (LOS−0.11) in the Sgr A region, another LOS is towards the 50 km s −1 cloud (LOS−0.02), also in Sgr A, while the third is towards the Sgr B2 cloud (LOS+0.693). The emission from the ionized gas is detected from Hnα and Hmβ radio recombination lines (RRLs). Henα and Hemβ RRL emission is detected with the same n and m as those from the hydrogen RRLs only towards LOS+0.693. RRLs probe gas with positive and negative velocities towards the two Sgr A sources. The Hmβ to Hnα ratios reveal that the ionized gas is emitted under local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions in these regions. We find a He to H mass fraction of 0.29±0.01 consistent with the typical GC value, supporting the idea that massive stars have increased the He abundance compared to its primordial value. Physical properties are derived for the studied sources. We propose that the negative velocity component of both Sgr A sources is part of gas streams considered previously to model the GC cloud kinematics. Associated massive stars with what are presumably the closest H II regions to LOS−0.11 (positive velocity gas), LOS−0.02, and LOS+0.693 could be the main sources of ultraviolet photons ionizing the gas. The negative velocity components of both Sgr A sources might be ionized by the same massive stars, but only if they are in the same gas stream.},

   abstract = {Cosmology and particle physics are deeply interrelated. Among the common problems are dark energy, dark matter and baryon asymmetry of the Universe. We discuss these problems in general terms, and concentrate on several particular hypotheses. On the dark matter side, we consider weakly interacting massive particles and axions/axion-like particles as cold dark matter, sterile neutrinos and gravitinos as warm dark matter. On the baryon asymmetry side, we discuss electroweak baryogenesis as a still-viable mechanism. We briefly describe diverse experimental and observational approaches towards checking these hypotheses. We then turn to the earliest cosmology. We give arguments showing that the hot stage was preceded by another epoch at which density perturbations and possibly primordial gravity waves were generated. The best guess here is inflation, which is consistent with everything we know of density perturbations, but there are alternative scenarios. Future measurements of the properties of density perturbations and possible discovery of primordial gravity waves have strong potential in this regard.},

Our best current estimate of the Hubble constant is 73 ± 2 (random) ± 4 (systematic) km s -1 Mpc-1. The importance of improved accuracy in the Hubble constant will increase over the next decade with new missions and experiments designed to increase the precision in other cosmological parameters.

   abstract = {A comparison between published field galaxy stellar mass functions (GSMFs) shows that the cosmic stellar mass density is in the range 4-8 per cent of the baryon density (assuming Ωb = 0.045). There remain significant sources of uncertainty for the dust correction and underlying stellar mass-to-light ratio even assuming a reasonable universal stellar initial mass function. We determine the z < 0.05 GSMF using the New York University Value-Added Galaxy Catalog sample of 49 968 galaxies derived from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and various estimates of stellar mass. The GSMF shows clear evidence for a low-mass upturn and is fitted with a double Schechter function that has α2 ≃ -1.6. At masses below ∼108.5 M⊙, the GSMF may be significantly incomplete because of missing low-surface-brightness galaxies. One interpretation of the stellar mass-metallicity relation is that it is primarily caused by a lower fraction of available baryons converted to stars in low-mass galaxies. Using this principle, we determine a simple relationship between baryonic mass and stellar mass and present an 'implied baryonic mass function'. This function has a faint-end slope, α2 ≃ -1.9. Thus, we find evidence that the slope of the low-mass end of the galaxy mass function could plausibly be as steep as the halo mass function. We illustrate the relationship between halo baryonic mass function → galaxy baryonic mass function → GSMF. This demonstrates the requirement for peak galaxy formation efficiency at baryonic masses ∼1011 M⊙ corresponding to a minimum in feedback effects. The baryonic-infall efficiency may have levelled off at lower masses. © 2008 RAS.},

   abstract = {We measure the stellar mass function (SMF) and stellar mass density of galaxies in the COSMOS field up to z ~ 6. We select them in the near-IR bands of the COSMOS2015 catalogue, which includes ultra-deep photometry from UltraVISTA-DR2, SPLASH, and Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam. At z> 2.5 we use new precise photometric redshifts with error σz = 0.03(1 + z) and an outlier fraction of 12%, estimated by means of the unique spectroscopic sample of COSMOS (~100 000 spectroscopic measurements in total, more than one thousand having robust zspec> 2.5). The increased exposure time in the DR2, along with our panchromatic detection strategy, allow us to improve the completeness at high z with respect to previous UltraVISTA catalogues (e.g. our sample is >75% complete at 1010 ℳ and z = 5). We also identify passive galaxies through a robust colour-colour selection, extending their SMF estimate up to z = 4. Our work provides a comprehensive view of galaxy-stellar-mass assembly between z = 0.1 and 6, for the first time using consistent estimates across the entire redshift range. We fit these measurements with a Schechter function, correcting for Eddington bias. We compare the SMF fit with the halo mass function predicted from ΛCDM simulations, finding that at z> 3 both functions decline with a similar slope in thehigh-mass end. This feature could be explained assuming that mechanisms quenching star formation in massive haloes become less effective at high redshifts; however further work needs to be done to confirm this scenario. Concerning the SMF low-mass end, it shows a progressive steepening as it moves towards higher redshifts, with α decreasing from -1.47+0.02-0.02-1.47-0.02+0.02 at z ≃ 0.1 to -2.11+0.30-0.13-2.11-0.13+0.30 at z ≃ 5. This slope depends on the characterisation of the observational uncertainties, which is crucial to properly remove the Eddington bias. We show that there is currently no consensus on the method to quantify such errors: Different error models result in different best-fit Schechter parameters.},

   abstract = {We present number counts, luminosity functions (LFs) and luminosity densities of galaxies obtained using the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Sixth Data Release (SDSS DR6) in all SDSS photometric bands. Thanks to the SDSS DR6, galaxy statistics have increased by a factor of ∼7 in the u band and by a factor between ∼3 and ∼5 in the rest of the SDSS bands with respect to the previous work of Blanton et al. In addition, we have ensured a high redshift completeness in our galaxy samples, mainly by minimizing the effect of brightness-dependent incompleteness. With these advances, we have estimated very accurate SDSS DR6 LFs at both the bright and the faint end. In the 0.1r band, our LF is well fitted by a Schechter LF with parameters Φ* = 0.93 ± 0.07, M* - 5log 10 h = -20.71 ± 0.04 and α = -1.26 ± 0.02. As compared with previous results, we find some notable differences. At the bright end of the 0.1u-band LF we find a remarkable excess, of ∼1.7 dex at, with respect to the best-fitting Schechter LF. This excess weakens in the 0.1g band, fading away towards the very red 0.1z band. A preliminary analysis on the nature of this bright-end bump reveals that it is composed of quasi-stellar objects/type 1 Seyferts (∼60 per cent), starbursts and star-forming galaxies (∼20 per cent) and normal galaxies (∼20 per cent). It seems, therefore, that an important fraction of this excess luminosity may come from nuclear activity. At the faint end of the SDSS DR6 LFs, where we can reach 0.5-1 mag deeper than the previous SDSS LF estimations, we obtain a steeper slope that increases from the 0.1u band, with α = -1.05 ± 0.05, to the very red 0.1z band, with α = -1.26 ± 0.03. We have also investigated the effect of galaxy evolution on our LFs. These state-of-the-art results may be used to constrain a variety of aspects of star formation histories and/or feedback processes in galaxy formation models. © 2009 RAS.},

Here, we introduce the first two simulations of the series, TNG100 and TNG300, and quantify the stellar mass content of about 4000 massive galaxy groups and clusters (1013 = M200c/M⊙ = 1015) at recent times (z = 1). The richest clusters have half of their total stellar mass bound to satellite galaxies, with the other half being associated with the central galaxy and the diffuse intracluster light. Haloes more massive than about 5 × 1014M⊙ have more diffuse stellar mass outside 100 kpc than within 100 kpc, with power-law slopes of the radial mass density distribution as shallow as the dark matter's (-3.5 ≲ α 3D ≲ -3). Total halo mass is a very good predictor of stellar mass, and vice versa: at z = 0, the 3D stellar mass measured within 30 kpc scales as α(M500c)0.49 with a⊙0.12 dex scatter. This is possibly too steep in comparison to the available observational constraints, even though the abundance of The Next Generation less-massive galaxies (≲1011M⊙ in stars) is in good agreement with the measured galaxy stellar mass functions at recent epochs. The 3D sizes of massive galaxies fall too on a tight (~0.16 dex scatter) power-law relation with halo mass, with rstars0.5 α (M200c)0.53. Even more fundamentally, halo mass alone is a good predictor for the whole stellar mass profiles beyond the inner few kiloparsecs, and we show how on average these can be precisely recovered given a single-mass measurement of the galaxy or its halo.},

We emphasize that the scaling relations followed by each galaxy type change very little with environment, with the exception of some minor but detectable effects. The shift in the population is apparent even at the densities of small groups and therefore cannot be exclusively due to physical processes operating in rich clusters. Third, we divide galaxies into four crude types-spiral, lenticular, elliptical, and merging systems-and describe some of their more detailed properties.

Despite its cosmological nature, little h commonly appears in the measured properties of individual galaxies. This can pose unique challenges for users of such data, particularly with survey data. In this paper we show how little h arises in the measurement of galaxies, how to compare like-properties from different datasets that have assumed different little h cosmologies, and how to fairly compare theoretical data with observed data, where little h can manifest in vastly different ways. This last point is particularly important when observations are used to calibrate galaxy formation models, as calibrating with the wrong (or no) little h can lead to disastrous results when the model is later converted to the correct h cosmology. We argue that in this modern age little h is an anachronism, being one of least uncertain parameters in astrophysics, and we propose that observers and theorists instead treat this uncertainty like any other. We conclude with a 'cheat sheet' of nine points that should be followed when dealing with little h in data analysis. © 2013 Astronomical Society of Australia.},

The best estimates obtained are 47 million times the solar luminosity per cu Mpc for the mean luminosity, a characteristic M/L ratio that is 120 times the solar value, and a galactic matter contribution of 0.08 to the critical mass-density ratio. It is shown that the statistical uncertainties in the galactic matter contribution probably do not exceed 50% and that the data nearly exclude a contribution of unity or more.

We examine spatial offsets between the position of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) and the centre of the gas distribution as traced by the SPT-SZ centroid and by the X-ray centroid/peak position from Chandra and XMM data. We show that the radial distribution of offsets provides no evidence that SPT SZ-selected cluster samples include a higher fraction of mergers than X-ray-selected cluster samples. We use the offsets to classify the dynamical state of the clusters, selecting the 43 most disturbed clusters, with half of those at z ≳ 0.5, a region seldom explored previously. We find that Schechter function fits to the galaxy population in disturbed clusters and relaxed clusters differ at z &gt; 0.55 but not at lower redshifts. Disturbed clusters at z &gt; 0.55 have steeper faint-end slopes and brighter characteristic magnitudes. Within the same redshift range, we find that the BCGs in relaxed clusters tend to be brighter than the BCGs in disturbed samples, while in agreement in the lower redshift bin. Possible explanations includes a higher merger rate, and a more efficient dynamical friction at high redshift.

The frequency spectrum of the FIRAS signal that has the spatial distribution seen by WMAP is shown to be consistent with CMB temperature fluctuations well into the Wien region of the spectrum. The consistency of these data, from very different instruments with very different observing strategies, provides compelling support for the interpretation that the signal seen by WMAP is temperature anisotropy of cosmological origin. The data also limit rms fluctuations in the Compton y parameter, observable via the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, to Dy ! (95% confidence level) on ∼5Њ angular scales.

   abstract = {We review the current understanding of the Diffuse Gamma-Ray Background (DGRB). The DGRB is what remains of the total measured gamma-ray emission after the subtraction of the resolved sources and of the diffuse Galactic foregrounds. It is interpreted as the cumulative emission of sources that are not bright enough to be detected individually. Yet, its exact composition remains unveiled. Well-established astrophysical source populations (e.g. blazars, misaligned AGNs, star-forming galaxies and millisecond pulsars) all represent guaranteed contributors to the DGRB. More exotic scenarios, such as Dark Matter annihilation or decay, may contribute as well. In this review, we describe how these components have been modeled in the literature and how the DGRB can be used to provide valuable information on each of them. We summarize the observational information currently available on the DGRB, paying particular attention to the most recent measurement of its intensity energy spectrum by the Fermi LAT Collaboration. We also discuss the novel analyses of the auto-correlation angular power spectrum of the DGRB and of its cross-correlation with tracers of the large-scale structure of the Universe. New data sets already (or soon) available are expected to provide further insight on the nature of this emission. By summarizing where we stand on the current knowledge of the DGRB, this review is intended both as a useful reference for those interested in the topic and as a means to trigger new ideas for further research.},

At ν= 150, 325, 408, 610, 1.4, 4.8 and 8.4GHz, our calculated contributions to the background sky temperature are 18, 2.8, 1.6, 0.71, 0.11, 0.0032 and 0.0059K, respectively. We then compare our results to absolute measurements from the Absolute Radiometer for Cosmology, Astrophysics and Diffuse Emission (ARCADE 2) experiment. If the ARCADE 2 measurements are correct and come from sources, then there must be an additional population of radio galaxies, fainter than where current data are probing.

   abstract = {Aims. We quantify the contributions of 24um galaxies to the Far-Infrared (FIR) Background at 70 and 160um. We provide new estimates of the Cosmic Infrared Background (CIB), and compare it with the Cosmic Optical Background (COB). Methods. Using Spitzer data at 24, 70 and 160um in three deep fields, we stacked more than 19000 MIPS 24um sources with S24>60uJy at 70 and 160um, and measured the resulting FIR flux densities. Results. This method allows a gain up to one order of magnitude in depth in the FIR. We find that the Mid-Infrared (MIR) 24um selected sources contribute to more than 70% of the CIB at 70 and 160um. This is the first direct measurement of the contribution of MIR-selected galaxies to the FIR CIB. Galaxies contributing the most to the total CIB are thus z~1 luminous infrared galaxies, which have intermediate stellar masses. We estimate that the CIB will be resolved at 0.9 mJy at 70 and 3 mJy at 160um. By combining the extrapolation of the 24um source counts below 60uJy, with 160/24 and 70/24 colors as measured with the stacking analysis, we obtain lower limits of 7.1+/-1.0 and 13.4+/-1.7 nW/m2/sr for the CIB at 70 and 160um, respectively. Conclusions. The MIPS surveys have resolved more than three quarters of the MIR and FIR CIB. By carefully integrating the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) SED, we also find that the CIB has the same brightness as the COB, around 24 nW/m2/sr. The EBL is produced on average by 115 infrared photons for one visible photon. Finally, the galaxy formation and evolution processes emitted a brightness equivalent to 5% of the primordial electromagnetic background (CMB).},

   abstract = {The cosmic microwave background radiation provides unique constraints on cosmological models. In this Letter we present a summary of the spatial properties of the cosmic microwave background radiation based on the full 4 years of COBE DMR observations, as detailed in a set of companion Letters. The anisotropy is consistent with a scale-invariant power law model and Gaussian statistics. With full use of the multi-frequency 4-year DMR data, including our estimate of the effects of Galactic emission, we find a power-law spectral index of $n=1.2\pm 0.3$ and a quadrupole normalization $Q_\{rms-PS\}=15.3^\{+3.8\}_\{-2.8\}$ $\mu$K. For $n=1$ the best-fit normalization is $Q_\{rms-PS\}\vert_\{n=1\}=18\pm 1.6$ $\mu$K. These values are consistent with both our previous 1-year and 2-year results. The results include use of the $\ell=2$ quadrupole term; exclusion of this term gives consistent results, but with larger uncertainties. The 4-year sky maps, presented in this Letter, portray an accurate overall visual impression of the anisotropy since the signal-to-noise ratio is ~2 per 10 degree sky map patch. The improved signal-to-noise ratio of the 4-year maps also allows for improvements in Galactic modeling and limits on non-Gaussian statistics.},

   abstract = {The Bullet Cluster has provided some of the best evidence for the Λcold dark matter (ΛCDM) model via direct empirical proof of the existence of collisionless dark matter, while posing a serious challenge owing to the unusually high inferred pairwise velocities of its progenitor clusters. Here, we investigate the probability of finding such a high-velocity pair in large-volume N-body simulations, particularly focusing on differences between halo-finding algorithms.We find that algorithms that do not account for the kinematics of infalling groups yield vastly different statistics and probabilities. When employing the ROCKSTAR halo finder that considers particle velocities, we find numerous Bullet-like pair candidates that closely match not only the high pairwise velocity, but also themass, mass ratio, separation distance, and collision angle of the initial conditions that have been shown to produce the Bullet Cluster in non-cosmological hydrodynamic simulations. The probability of finding a high pairwise velocity pair among haloes with Mhalo ≥ 1014 M⊙ is 4.6 × 10-4 using ROCKSTAR, while it is ≈34 × lower using a friends-of-friends (FoF)-based approach as in previous studies. This is because the typical spatial extent of Bullet progenitors is such that FoF tends to group them into a single halo despite clearly distinct kinematics. Further requiring an appropriately high average mass among the two progenitors, we find the comoving number density of potential Bullet-like candidates to be of the order of ≈ 10-10 Mpc-3. Our findings suggest that ΛCDM straightforwardly produces massive, high relative velocity halo pairs analogous to Bullet Cluster progenitors, and hence the Bullet Cluster does not present a challenge to the ΛCDM model.},

One cluster candidate, PLCKESZ G255.62-46.16, is located in the 2500deg2 SPT SZ survey region and was reported previously as SPT-CL J0411-4819. For the remaining four candidates, which are located outside of the SPT SZ survey region, we performed short, dedicated SPT observations. Each of these four candidates was strongly detected in maps made from these observations, with signal-to-noise ratios ranging from 6.3 to 13.8. We have observed these four candidates on the Magellan-Baade telescope and used these data to estimate cluster redshifts from the red sequence. Resulting redshifts range from 0.24 to 0.46. We report measurements of Y 075, the integrated Comptonization within a 075 radius, for all five candidates. We also report X-ray luminosities calculated from ROSAT All-Sky Survey catalog counts, as well as optical and improved SZ coordinates for each candidate. The combination of SPT SZ measurements, optical red-sequence measurements, and X-ray luminosity estimates demonstrates that these five Planck ESZ cluster candidates do indeed correspond to real galaxy clusters with redshifts and observable properties consistent with the rest of the ESZ sample. © 2011.

We use the optical/NIR data to establish whether each candidate is associated with an overdensity of galaxies and to estimate the cluster redshift. Most photometric redshifts are derived through a combination of three different cluster redshift estimators using red-sequence galaxies, resulting in an accuracy of Δz/(1 + z) = 0.017, determined through comparison with a subsample of 57 clusters for which we have spectroscopic redshifts. We successfully measure redshifts for 158 systems and present redshift lower limits for the remaining candidates. The redshift distribution of the confirmed clusters extends to z = 1.35 with a median of z med = 0.57. Approximately 18% of the sample with measured redshifts lies at z > 0.8. We estimate a lower limit to the purity of this SPT SZ-selected sample by assuming that all unconfirmed clusters are noise fluctuations in the SPT data. We show that the cumulative purity at detection significance ξ > 5(ξ > 4.5) is ≥95% (≥70%). We present the red brightest cluster galaxy (rBCG) positions for the sample and examine the offsets between the SPT candidate position and the rBCG. The radial distribution of offsets is similar to that seen in X-ray-selected cluster samples, providing no evidence that SZ-selected cluster samples include a different fraction of recent mergers from X-ray-selected cluster samples. © 2012.

   abstract = {We present a catalog of galaxy clusters selected via their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect signature from 2500 deg2 of South Pole Telescope (SPT) data. This work represents the complete sample of clusters detected at high significance in the 2500 deg2 SPT-SZ survey, which was completed in 2011. A total of 677 (409) cluster candidates are identified above a signal-to-noise threshold of ξ = 4.5 (5.0). Ground- and space-based optical and near-infrared (NIR) imaging confirms overdensities of similarly colored galaxies in the direction of 516 (or 76%) of the ξ > 4.5 candidates and 387 (or 95%) of the ξ > 5 candidates; the measured purity is consistent with expectations from simulations. Of these confirmed clusters, 415 were first identified in SPT data, including 251 new discoveries reported in this work. We estimate photometric redshifts for all candidates with identified optical and/or NIR counterparts; we additionally report redshifts derived from spectroscopic observations for 141 of these systems. The mass threshold of the catalog is roughly independent of redshift above z 0.25 leading to a sample of massive clusters that extends to high redshift. The median mass of the sample is M 500c(ρcrit) , the median redshift is z med = 0.55, and the highest-redshift systems are at z > 1.4. The combination of large redshift extent, clean selection, and high typical mass makes this cluster sample of particular interest for cosmological analyses and studies of cluster formation and evolution.},

   abstract = {We present the new constraints on the cosmic optical background (COB) obtained from an analysis of the Pioneer 10/11 Imaging Photopolarimeter (IPP) data. After careful examination of data quality, the usable measurements free from the zodiacal light are integrated into sky maps at the blue (∼0.44 μm) and red (∼0.64 μm) band. Accurate starlight subtraction is achieved by referring to all-sky star catalogs and a Galactic stellar population synthesis model down to 32.0mag. We find that the residual light is separated into two components: one component shows a clear correlation with thermal 100 μm brightness, while another betrays a constant level in the lowest 100 μm brightness region. The presence of the second component is significant after all the uncertainties and possible residual light in the Galaxy are taken into account, and thus it most likely has the extragalactic origin (i.e., the COB). The derived COB brightness is (1.8 ± 0.9) × 10-9 and (1.2 ± 0.9) × 10-9ergs-1cm -2sr-1Å-1 at the blue and red bands, respectively, or 7.9 ± 4.0 and 7.7 ± 5.8nWm-2sr -1. From comparison with the integrated brightness of galaxies, we conclude that bulk of the COB is comprised of normal galaxies which have already been resolved in the current deepest observations. There seems to be little room for contributions of other populations including "first stars" at these wavelengths. On the other hand, the first component of the IPP residual light represents the diffuse Galactic light (DGL) - scattered starlight by the interstellar dust. We derive mean DGL-to-100 μm brightness ratios of 2.1 × 10-3 and 4.6 × 10-3 at the two bands, which are roughly consistent with the previous observations toward the denser dust regions. Extended red emission in the diffuse interstellar medium is also confirmed. © 2011. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {There has been much debate about the origin of the diffuse $\gamma$--ray background in the MeV range. At lower energies, AGNs and Seyfert galaxies can explain the background, but not above $\simeq$0.3 MeV. Beyond $\sim$10 MeV blazars appear to account for the flux observed. That leaves an unexplained gap for which different candidates have been proposed, including annihilations of WIMPS. One candidate are Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia). Early studies concluded that they were able to account for the $\gamma$--ray background in the gap, while later work attributed a significantly lower contribution to them. All those estimates were based on SN Ia explosion models which did not reflect the full 3D hydrodynamics of SNe Ia explosions. In addition, new measurements obtained since 2010 have provided new, direct estimates of high-z SNe Ia rates beyond $z\sim$2. We take into account these new advances to see the predicted contribution to the gamma--ray background. We use here a wide variety of explosion models and a plethora of new measurements of SNe Ia rates. SNe Ia still fall short of the observed background. Only for a fit, which would imply $\sim$150\% systematic error in detecting SNe Ia events, do the theoretical predictions approach the observed fluxes. This fit is, however, at odds at the highest redshifts with recent SN Ia rates estimates. Other astrophysical sources such as FSRQs do match the observed flux levels in the MeV regime, while SNe Ia make up to 30--50\% of the observed flux.},

This paper gives an overview of recent progress in understanding the high-energy (>~10 keV) X-ray emission from AGNs and the synthesis of the CXB, with an emphasis on results from NASA's NuSTAR hard X-ray mission. We then discuss remaining challenges and open questions regarding the nature of AGN obscuration and AGN physics.

   abstract = {The cosmic optical background is an important observable that constrains energy production in stars and more exotic physical processes in the universe, and provides a crucial cosmological benchmark against which to judge theories of structure formation. Measurement of the absolute brightness of this background is complicated by local foregrounds like the Earth's atmosphere and sunlight reflected from local interplanetary dust, and large discrepancies in the inferred brightness of the optical background have resulted. Observations from probes far from the Earth are not affected by these bright foregrounds. Here we analyse the data from the Long Range Reconnaissance Imager (LORRI) instrument on NASA's New Horizons mission acquired during cruise phase outside the orbit of Jupiter, and find a statistical upper limit on the optical background's brightness similar to the integrated light from galaxies. We conclude that a carefully performed survey with LORRI could yield uncertainties comparable to those from galaxy counting measurements.},

We also present the expected variation in the spectrum of the CRB as a function of these parameters, as well as accounting for the expected variation in spectral index among the population of radio galaxies. The new estimate presented in this work shows better agreement with observational constraints from radio source-count measurements than previous calculations. In the energy regime where we expect cosmogenic photons dominantly attenuated by the CRB, our calculation of the attenuation length differs from previous estimates by a factor of up to 3, depending on energy and the specific model for comparison. These results imply a decrease in the expected number of cosmogenic photons with energies $\sim 10^\{19\}-10^\{20\}$ eV.},

   abstract = {Hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation have now reached sufficient volume to make precision predictions for clustering on cosmologically relevant scales. Here, we use our new IllustrisTNG simulations to study the non-linear correlation functions and power spectra of baryons, dark matter, galaxies, and haloes over an exceptionally large range of scales. We find that baryonic effects increase the clustering of dark matter on small scales and damp the total matter power spectrum on scales up to k ~ 10 h Mpc-1 by 20 per cent. The non-linear two-point correlation function of the stellar mass is close to a power-law over a wide range of scales and approximately invariant in time from very high redshift to the present. The two-point correlation function of the simulated galaxies agrees well with Sloan Digital Sky Survey at its mean redshift z ≃ 0.1, both as a function of stellar mass and when split according to galaxy colour, apart from a mild excess in the clustering of red galaxies in the stellar mass range of109-1010 h-2Mo˙. Given this agreement, the TNG simulations can make valuable theoretical predictions for the clustering bias of different galaxy samples. We find that the clustering length of the galaxy autocorrelation function depends strongly on stellar mass and redshift. Its power-law slope γ is nearly invariant with stellar mass, but declines from γ ~ 1.8 at redshift z = 0 to γ ~ 1.6 at redshift z ~ 1, beyond which the slope steepens again. We detect significant scale dependences in the bias of different observational tracers of largescale structure, extending well into the range of the baryonic acoustic oscillations and causing nominal (yet fortunately correctable) shifts of the acoustic peaks of around ~5 per cent.},

   abstract = {We use analytic computations to predict the power spectrum as well as the bispectrum of cosmic infrared background (CIB) anisotropies. Our approach is based on the halo model and takes into account the mean luminosity-mass relation. The model is used to forecast the possibility to simultaneously constrain cosmological, CIB, and halo occupation distribution (HOD) parameters in the presence of foregrounds. For the analysis, we use wavelengths in eight frequency channels between 200 and 900 GHz with survey specifications given by Planck and LiteBird. We explore the sensitivity to the model parameters up to multipoles of ι = 1000 using autocorrelation and cross-correlation between the different frequency bands. With this setting, cosmological, HOD, and CIB parameters can be constrained to a few per cent. Galactic dust is modelled by a power law and the shot-noise contribution as a frequency-dependent amplitude that are marginalized over. We find that dust residuals in the CIB maps only marginally influence constraints on standard cosmological parameters. Furthermore, the bispectrum yields tighter constraints (by a factor 4 in 1σ errors) on almost all model parameters, while the degeneracy directions are very similar to the ones of the power spectrum. The increase in sensitivity is most pronounced for the sum of the neutrino masses. Due to the similarity of degeneracies, a combination of both analysis is not needed for most parameters. This, however, might be due to the simplified bias description generally adopted in such halo model approaches.},

   abstract = {The friends-of-friends algorithm (hereafter FOF) is a percolation algorithm which is routinely used to identify dark matter halos from N-body simulations. We use results from percolation theory to show that the boundary of FOF halos does not correspond to a single density threshold but to a range of densities close to a critical value that depends upon the linking length parameter, b. We show that for the commonly used choice of b = 0.2, this critical density is equal to 81.62 times the mean matter density. Consequently, halos identified by the FOF algorithm enclose an average overdensity which depends on their density profile (concentration) and therefore changes with halo mass, contrary to the popular belief that the average overdensity is ∼180. We derive an analytical expression for the overdensity as a function of the linking length parameter b and the concentration of the halo. Results of tests carried out using simulated and actual FOF halos identified in cosmological simulations show excellent agreement with our analytical prediction. We also find that the mass of the halo that the FOF algorithm selects crucially depends upon mass resolution. We find a percolation-theory-motivated formula that is able to accurately correct for the dependence on number of particles for the mock realizations of spherical and triaxial Navarro-Frenk-White halos. However, we show that this correction breaks down when applied to the real cosmological FOF halos due to the presence of substructures. Given that abundance of substructure depends on redshift and cosmology, we expect that the resolution effects due to substructure on the FOF mass and halo mass function will also depend on redshift and cosmology and will be difficult to correct for in general. Finally, we discuss the implications of our results for the universality of the mass function. © 2011. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

   abstract = {We describe a simple and fast algorithm for identifying friends-of-friends features and prove its correctness. The algorithm avoids unnecessary expensive neighbor queries, uses minimal memory overhead, and rejects slowdown in high over-density regions. We define our algorithm formally based on pair enumeration, a problem that has been heavily studied in fast 2-point correlation codes and our reference implementation employs a dual KD-tree correlation function code. We construct features in a hierarchical tree structure, and use a splay operation to reduce the average cost of identifying the root of a feature from O[logL] to O[1] (L is the size of a feature) without additional memory costs. This reduces the overall time complexity of merging trees from O[LlogL] to O[L], reducing the number of operations per splay by orders of magnitude. We next introduce a pruning operation that skips merge operations between two fully self-connected KD-tree nodes. This improves the robustness of the algorithm, reducing the number of merge operations in high density peaks from O[δ2] to O[δ]. We show that for cosmological data set the algorithm eliminates more than half of merge operations for typically used linking lengths b∼0.2 (relative to mean separation). Furthermore, our algorithm is extremely simple and easy to implement on top of an existing pair enumeration code, reusing the optimization effort that has been invested in fast correlation function codes.},

   abstract = {We measure the mass function of dark matter halos in a large set of collisionless cosmological simulations of flat LCDM cosmology and investigate its evolution at z<~2. Halos are identified as isolated density peaks, and their masses are measured within a series of radii enclosing specific overdensities. We argue that these spherical overdensity masses are more directly linked to cluster observables than masses measured using the friends-of-friends algorithm (FOF), and are therefore preferable for accurate forecasts of halo abundances. Our simulation set allows us to calibrate the mass function at z=0 for virial masses in the range 10^\{11\} Msol/h < M < 10^\{15\} Msol/h, to <~ 5%. We derive fitting functions for the halo mass function in this mass range for a wide range of overdensities, both at z=0 and earlier epochs. In addition to these formulae, which improve on previous approximations by 10-20%, our main finding is that the mass function cannot be represented by a universal fitting function at this level of accuracy. The amplitude of the "universal" function decreases monotonically by ~20-50%, depending on the mass definition, from z=0 to 2.5. We also find evidence for redshift evolution in the overall shape of the mass function.},

   abstract = {The specific star formation rates of galaxies are influenced both by their mass and by their environment. Moreover, the mass function of groups and clusters serves as a powerful cosmological tool. It is thus important to quantify the accuracy to which group properties are extracted from redshift surveys. We test here the Friends-of-Friends (FoF) grouping algorithm, which depends on two linking lengths (LLs), plane-of-sky and line-of-sight (LOS), normalized to the mean nearest neighbour separation of field galaxies.We argue, on theoretical grounds, that LLs should be b⊥ = 0.11, and b|| = 1.3 to recover 95 per cent of all galaxies with projected radii within the virial radius r200 and 95 per cent of the galaxies along the LOS.We then predict that 80 to 90 per cent of the galaxies in FoF groups should lie within their parent real-space groups (RSGs), defined within their virial spheres. We test the FoF extraction for 16 × 16 pairs of LLs, using subsamples of galaxies, doubly complete in distance and luminosity, of a flux-limited mock Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxy catalogue. We find that massive RSGs aremore prone to fragmentation, while the fragments typically have lowestimated mass, with typically 30 per cent of groups of low and intermediate estimated mass being fragments. Group merging rises drastically with estimated mass. For groups of three or more galaxies, galaxy completeness and reliability are both typically better than 80 per cent (after discarding the fragments). Estimated masses of extracted groups are biased low, by up to a factor 4 at low richness, while the inefficiency of mass estimation improves from 0.85 dex to 0.2 dex when moving from low to high multiplicity groups. The optimal LLs depend on the scientific goal for the group catalogue. We propose b⊥ = 0.07, with b|| = 1.1 for studies of environmental effects, b|| = 2.5 for cosmographic studies and b|| = 5 for followups of individual groups. © 2014 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

Current evidence is presented, from the analysis of the orbits of more than two dozen stars and from the measurements of the size and motion of the central compact radio source, Sgr A*, that this radio source must be a massive black hole of about 4.4× 106 Ma, beyond any reasonable doubt. What is known about the structure and evolution of the dense nuclear star cluster surrounding this black hole is reported, including the astounding fact that stars have been forming in the vicinity of Sgr A* recently, apparently with a top-heavy stellar-mass function. A dense concentration of fainter stars centered in the immediate vicinity of the massive black hole are discussed, three of which have orbital peri-bothroi of less than one light day. This "S-star cluster" appears to consist mainly of young early-type stars, in contrast to the predicted properties of an equilibrium "stellar cusp" around a black hole. This constitutes a remarkable and presently not fully understood "paradox of youth." What is known about the emission properties of the accreting gas onto Sgr A* is also summarized and how this emission is beginning to delineate the physical properties in the hot accretion zone around the event horizon. © 2011 American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {We present the MAssive ClusterS and Intercluster Structures (MACSIS) project, a suite of 390 clusters simulated with baryonic physics that yields realistic massive galaxy clusters capable of matching a wide range of observed properties. MACSIS extends the recent BAryons and HAloes of MAssive Systems simulation to higher masses, enabling robust predictions for the redshift evolution of cluster properties and an assessment of the effect of selecting only the hottest systems. We study the observable-mass scaling relations and the X-ray luminosity- temperature relation over the complete observed cluster mass range. As expected, we find that the slope of these scaling relations and the evolution of their normalization with redshift depart significantly from the self-similar predictions.However, for a sample of hot clusters with core-excised temperatures kBT ≥ 5keV, the normalization and the slope of the observable- mass relations and their evolution are significantly closer to self-similar. The exception is the temperature-mass relation, for which the increased importance of non-thermal pressure support and biased X-ray temperatures leads to a greater departure from self-similarity in the hottest systems. As a consequence, these also affect the slope and evolution of the normalization in the luminosity-temperature relation. The median hot gas profiles show good agreement with observational data at z = 0 and z = 1, with their evolution again departing significantly from the self-similar prediction. However, selecting a hot sample of clusters yields profiles that evolve significantly closer to the self-similar prediction. In conclusion, our results show that understanding the selection function is vital for robust calibration of cluster properties with mass and redshift.},

   abstract = {We show that, observationally, the projected local density distribution in high-z clusters is shifted towards higher values compared to clusters at lower redshift. To search for the origin of this evolution, we analyse a sample of haloes selected from the Millennium simulation and populated using semi-analytic models, investigating the relation between observed projected density and physical three-dimensional (3D) density, using densities computed from the 10 and three closest neighbours. Both observationally and in the simulations,we study the relation between number of cluster members and cluster mass, and the number of members per unit of cluster mass. We find that the observed evolution of projected densities reflects a shift to higher values of the physical 3D density distribution. In turn, this must be related with the globally higher number of galaxies per unit of cluster volume N/V in the past. We show that the evolution of N/V is due to a combination of two effects: (i) distant clusters were denser in dark matter (DM) simply because the DM density within R200 (~ the cluster virial radius) is defined to be a fixed multiple of the critical density of the Universe, and (ii) the number of galaxies per unit of cluster DM mass is remarkably constant both with redshift and cluster mass if counting galaxies brighter than a passively evolving magnitude limit. Our results highlight that distant clusters were much denser environments than today's clusters, both in galaxy number and mass, and that the density conditions felt by galaxies in virialized systems do not depend on the system mass.},

	abstract = {We present composite 3.6 and 4.5 μm luminosity functions (LFs) for cluster galaxies measured from the Spitzer Deep, Wide-Field Survey for 0.3 < z < 2. We compare the evolution of m* for these LFs to models for passively evolving stellar populations to constrain the primary epoch of star formation in massive cluster galaxies. At low redshifts (z ≲ 1.3), our results agree well with models with no mass assembly and passively evolving stellar populations with a luminosity-weighted mean formation redshift zf = 2.4 assuming a Kroupa initial mass function (IMF). We conduct a thorough investigation of systematic biases that might influence our results, and estimate systematic uncertainties of Δzf = +0.16−0.18 (model normalization), Δzf = +0.40−0.05 (α), and Δzf = +0.30−0.45 (choice of stellar population model). For a Salpeter-type IMF, the typical formation epoch is thus strongly constrained to be z ∼ 2–3. Higher formation redshifts can only be made consistent with the data if one permits an evolving IMF that is bottom-light at high redshift, as suggested by van Dokkum. At high redshifts (z ≳ 1.3), we also witness a statistically significant (>5σ) disagreement between the measured LF and the continuation of the passive evolution model from lower redshifts. After considering potential systematic biases that might influence our highest redshift data points, we interpret the observed deviation as potential evidence for ongoing mass assembly at this epoch.}

   abstract = {This is the second in a series of papers in which we derive simultaneous constraints on cosmology and X-ray scaling relations using observations of massive, X-ray flux-selected galaxy clusters. The data set consists of 238 clusters with 0.1-2.4 keV luminosities >2.5 × 1044 h-270 erg s-1, and incorporates follow-up observations of 94 of those clusters using the Chandra X-ray Observatory or ROSAT (11 were observed with both). The clusters are drawn from three samples based on the ROSAT All-Sky Survey: the ROSAT Brightest Cluster Sample (78/37 clusters detected/followed-up), the ROSAT-ESO Flux-Limited X-ray sample (126/25) and the bright sub-sample of the Massive Cluster Survey (34/32). Our analysis accounts self-consistently for all selection effects, covariances and systematic uncertainties. Here we describe the reduction of the follow-up X-ray observations, present results on the cluster scaling relations, and discuss their implications. Our constraints on the luminosity-mass and temperature-mass relations, measured within r500, lead to three important results. First, the data support the conclusion that excess heating of the intracluster medium (or a combination of heating and condensation of the coldest gas) has altered its thermodynamic state from that expected in a simple, gravitationally dominated system; however, this excess heat is primarily limited to the central regions of clusters (r < 0.15r500). Secondly, the intrinsic scatter in the centre-excised luminosity-mass relation is remarkably small, being bounded at the <10 per cent level in current data; for the hot, massive clusters under investigation, this scatter is smaller than in either the temperature-mass or YX-mass relations (10-15 per cent). Thirdly, the evolution with redshift of the scaling relations is consistent with the predictions of simple, self-similar models of gravitational collapse, indicating that the mechanism responsible for heating the central regions of clusters was in operation before redshift 0.5 (the limit of our data) and that its effects on global cluster properties have not evolved strongly since then. Our results provide a new benchmark for comparison with numerical simulations of cluster formation and evolution. © 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2010 RAS.},

For confirmed candidates we have assembled deep three-band optical photometry using VLT/FORS2, deep near-infrared photometry in one or two bands using NTT/SOFI, deep optical spectroscopy using VLT/FORS2, wide field imaging in two or three bands using the ESO Wide Field Imager, and HST/ACS mosaic images for 10 of the most distant clusters. This first paper presents our sample and the VLT photometry we have obtained. We present images, colour-magnitude diagrams and richness estimates for our clusters, as well as giving redshifts and positions for the brightest cluster members.

   abstract = {Massive galaxy clusters are now found as early as -, 3 billion years after the Big Bang, containing stars that formed at even earlier epochs.1-3 The high-redshift progenitors of these galaxy clusters, termed 'protoclusters', are identified in cosmological simulations with the highest dark matter overdensities.4-6 While their observational signatures are less well defined compared to virialized clusters with a substantial hot intra-cluster medium (ICM), protoclusters are expected to contain extremely massive galaxies that can be observed as luminous starbursts.7 Recent claimed detections of protoclusters hosting such starbursts8-11 do not support the kind of rapid cluster core formation expected in simulations12 because these structures contain only a handful of starbursting galaxies spread throughout a broad structure, with poor evidence for eventual collapse into a protocluster. Here we report that the source SPT2349-56 consists of at least 14 gas-rich galaxies all lying at z = 4.31 based on sensitive observations of carbon monoxide and ionized carbon. We demonstrate that each of these galaxies is forming stars between 50 and 1000 times faster than our own Milky Way, and all are located within a projected region only -, 130 kiloparsecs in diameter. This galaxy surface density is more than 10 times the average blank field value (integrated over all redshifts) and >1000 times the average field volume density. The velocity dispersion (-, 410 km s-1) of these galaxies and enormous gas and star formation densities suggest that this system represents a galaxy cluster core at an advanced stage of formation when the Universe was only 1.4 billion years old. A comparison with other known protoclusters at high redshifts shows that SPT2349-56 is a uniquely massive and dense system that could be building one of the most massive structures in the Universe today.},

   abstract = {We present a catalog of galaxy clusters selected via their Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect signature from 2500 deg2 of South Pole Telescope (SPT) data. This work represents the complete sample of clusters detected at high significance in the 2500 deg2 SPT-SZ survey, which was completed in 2011. A total of 677 (409) cluster candidates are identified above a signal-to-noise threshold of ξ = 4.5 (5.0). Ground- and space-based optical and near-infrared (NIR) imaging confirms overdensities of similarly colored galaxies in the direction of 516 (or 76%) of the ξ > 4.5 candidates and 387 (or 95%) of the ξ > 5 candidates; the measured purity is consistent with expectations from simulations. Of these confirmed clusters, 415 were first identified in SPT data, including 251 new discoveries reported in this work. We estimate photometric redshifts for all candidates with identified optical and/or NIR counterparts; we additionally report redshifts derived from spectroscopic observations for 141 of these systems. The mass threshold of the catalog is roughly independent of redshift above z 0.25 leading to a sample of massive clusters that extends to high redshift. The median mass of the sample is M 500c(ρcrit) , the median redshift is z med = 0.55, and the highest-redshift systems are at z > 1.4. The combination of large redshift extent, clean selection, and high typical mass makes this cluster sample of particular interest for cosmological analyses and studies of cluster formation and evolution.},

   abstract = {We study the dynamical state and the integrated total mass profiles of 75 massive ( M 500 > 5 × 10 14 M ⊙ ) Sunyaev–Zeldovich(SZ)-selected clusters at 0.08 < z < 1.1. The sample is built from the Planck catalogue, with the addition of four SPT clusters at z > 0.9. Using XMM-Newton imaging observations, we characterise the dynamical state with the centroid shift ⟨ w ⟩, the concentration C SB , and their combination, M , which simultaneously probes the core and the large-scale gas morphology. Using spatially resolved spectroscopy and assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, we derive the total integrated mass profiles. The mass profile shape is quantified by the sparsity, that is the ratio of M 500 to M 2500 , the masses at density contrasts of 500 and 2500, respectively. We study the correlations between the various parameters and their dependence on redshift. We confirm that SZ-selected samples, thought to most accurately reflect the underlying cluster population, are dominated by disturbed and non-cool core objects at all redshifts. There is no significant evolution or mass dependence of either the cool core fraction or the centroid shift parameter. The M parameter evolves slightly with z , having a correlation coefficient of ρ = −0.2 ± 0.1 and a null hypothesis p -value of 0.01. In the high-mass regime considered here, the sparsity evolves minimally with redshift, increasing by 10% between z < 0.2 and z > 0.55, an effect that is significant at less than 2 σ . In contrast, the dependence of the sparsity on dynamical state is much stronger, increasing by a factor of ∼60% from the one third most relaxed to the one third most disturbed objects, an effect that is significant at more than 3 σ . This is the first observational evidence that the shape of the integrated total mass profile in massive clusters is principally governed by the dynamical state and is only mildly dependent on redshift. We discuss the consequences for the comparison between observations and theoretical predictions.},

   abstract = {We study velocity moments of elliptical galaxies in the Coma cluster using Jeans equations. The dark matter distribution in the cluster is modelled by a generalized formula based upon the results of cosmological N-body simulations. Its inner slope (cuspy or flat), concentration and mass within the virial radius are kept as free parameters, as well as the velocity anisotropy, assumed independent of position. We show that the study of line-of-sight velocity dispersion alone does not allow us to constrain the parameters. By a joint analysis of the observed profiles of velocity dispersion and kurtosis, we are able to break the degeneracy between the mass distribution and velocity anisotropy. We determine the dark matter distribution at radial distances larger than 3 per cent of the virial radius and we find that the galaxy orbits are close to isotropic. Due to limited resolution, different inner slopes are found to be consistent with the data and we observe a strong degeneracy between the inner slope a and concentration c; the best-fitting profiles have the two parameters related with c = 19-9.6α. Our best-fitting Navarro-Frenk-White profile has concentration c = 9, which is 50 per cent higher than standard values found in cosmological simulations for objects of similar mass. The total mass within the virial radius of 2.9h70-1 Mpc is 1.4 × 1015h70-1 M⊙ (with 30 per cent accuracy), 85 per cent of which is dark. At this distance from the cluster centre, the mass-to-light ratio in the blue band is 351h70 solar units. The total mass within the virial radius leads to estimates of the density parameter of the Universe, assuming that clusters trace the mass-to-light ratio and baryonic fraction of the Universe, with Ω 0 = 0.29 ± 0.1.},

   abstract = {We present the ellipticity distribution and its evolution for early-type galaxies in clusters from z∼ 0.8 to the current epoch, based on the WIde-field Nearby Galaxy-cluster Survey (0.04 ≤z≤ 0.07) and the ESO Distant Cluster Survey (0.4 ≤z≤ 0.8). We first investigate a mass-limited sample and we find that above a fixed mass limit (M*≥ 1010.2M⊙), the ellipticity (ε) distribution of early-type galaxies notably evolves with redshift. In the local Universe, there are proportionally more galaxies with higher ellipticity, hence flatter, than in distant clusters. This evolution is due partly to the change in the mass distribution and mainly to the change in the morphological mix with z among the early types, the fraction of ellipticals goes from ∼70 per cent at high z to ∼40 per cent at low z). Analysing separately the ellipticity distribution of the different morphological types, we find no evolution both for ellipticals and for S0s. However, for ellipticals a change with redshift in the median value of the distributions is detected. This is due to a larger population of very round (ε < 0.05) elliptical galaxies at low z. In order to compare our finding to previous studies, we also assemble a magnitude-'delimited' sample that consists of early-type galaxies on the red sequence with -19.3 > MB+ 1.208z > -21. Analysing this sample, we do not recover exactly the same results as the mass-limited sample. This indicates that the selection criteria are crucial to characterize the galactic properties: the choice of the magnitude-'delimited' sample implies the loss of many less-massive galaxies and so it biases the final conclusions. Moreover, although we are adopting the same selection criteria, our results in the magnitude-'delimited' sample are also not in agreement with those of Holden et al. This is due to the fact that our and their low-zsamples have a different magnitude distribution because the Holden et al. sample suffers from incompleteness at faint magnitudes. © 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society © 2011 RAS.},

These objects be- come more intriguing, and understanding of these new findings becomes more challenging. Recently we discovered a new type of large scale structure in the Virgo cluster of galaxies: it is composed of globular clusters. Globular clusters in Virgo are found wandering between galaxies (intracluster globular clusters) as well as in galaxies. These intracluster globular clusters fill a significant fraction in the area of the Virgo cluster and they are dominated by blue globular clusters. These intracluster globular clusters may be closely related with the first dwarf galaxies in the universe.},

   abstract = {We present results of the X-ray analyses of the nearby cluster of galaxies Abell 2399 (z=0.058) using the XMM-Newton and Suzaku satellites. This cluster is classified as a low surface brightness (LSB) cluster. It has a bimodal structure in X-rays, and the X-ray-emission peaks are significantly offset from the peaks in gas temperature. By de-projecting the annular spectra, the temperature and electron density in the central r 0.1r200 region are measured to be 3.6 keV and 1.4×103 cm3, respectively. This yields a very high gas entropy, 300 keVcm2, in the central region, comparable to the values observed in other LSB clusters. The scaled entropy of Abell 2399 is the highest among the REXCESS cluster sample. The spatial distribution of the member galaxies exhibits multiple substructures, the locations of which are significantly different from those in the X-ray image. We discovered a clear discontinuity in the X-ray brightness and temperature distributions in the western gas clump, which provides evidence of the presence of a cold front. Therefore, our results strongly suggest that A2399 has experienced a merger and that the high central entropy originates from the merger activity.},

   abstract = {By means of statistical analyses, we compute the luminosity function of
galaxies in clusters and explore its dependence on cluster global
properties. The data consist of two different samples of southern
clusters with published redshifts, taken from the Abell cluster catalog
and the APM cluster catalog. Galaxy assignment to the clusters and their
corresponding apparent magnitudes were derived from the Edinburgh-Durham
Southern Galaxy Catalogue. We have considered two limiting absolute
magnitudes, M < -16 and M < -17, comprising 16 and 55 clusters,
respectively. The galaxy luminosity function in clusters derived in this
work shows a large excess of faint galaxies compared with previous field
determinations. In spite of their different identification procedures,
we obtain similar galaxy luminosity functions in Abell and APM clusters.
A Schechter function with parameters M* ~= -20.0 +/- 0.1 and alpha ~=
-1.4 +/- 0.1 provides a satisfactory fit to the galaxy luminosity
function of the sample of 55 clusters. We also find a flatter galaxy
luminosity function in poor clusters ( alpha ~= -1.2). We have computed
errors through a Monte Carlo procedure that considers different possible
background corrections and errors in the photometry. Besides providing
reliable values of the uncertainties in the luminosity function fitting
parameters, this method poses confident limits on the effects of
possible systematics. Our results strongly argue against a universal
galaxy luminosity function. The high relative frequency of faint
galaxies in rich clusters reported in this work may provide constraints
on models for the origin and evolution of galaxies.},

We perform a combined weak- and strong-lensing analysis with wide-field BVR c i′z′ Subaru/Suprime-Cam observations and 16-band Hubble Space Telescope observations taken as part of the Cluster Lensing And Supernova survey with Hubble. We find consistent weak distortion and magnification measurements of background galaxies and combine these signals to construct an optimally estimated radial mass profile of the cluster and its surrounding large-scale structure out to 5 Mpc h -1. We find consistency between strong-lensing and weak-lensing in the region where these independent data overlap, <500 kpc h -1. The two-dimensional weak-lensing map reveals a clear filamentary structure traced by distinct mass halos. We model the lensing shear field with nine halos, including the main cluster, corresponding to mass peaks detected above 2.5σ κ. The total mass of the cluster as determined by the different methods is M vir = (2.8 ± 0.4) × 1015 M. Although this is the most massive cluster known at z > 0.5, in terms of extreme value statistics, we conclude that the mass of MACS J0717.5+3745 by itself is not in serious tension with ΛCDM, representing only a =2σ departure above the maximum simulated halo mass at this redshift. © 2013.

Combining with previous spectroscopic measurements of 15 other multiply imaged sources, we have obtained a sample of 102 secure multiple images with measured redshifts, the largest to date in a single strong lensing system. The newly confirmed sources are largely low-luminosity Lyman-α emitters with redshift in the range [3.08-6.15]. With such a large number of secure constraints, and a significantly improved sample of galaxy members in the cluster core, we have improved our previous strong lensing model and obtained a robust determination of the projected total mass distribution of MACS 0416. We find evidence of three cored dark-matter halos, adding to the known complexity of this merging system. The total mass density profile, as well as the sub-halo population, are found to be in good agreement with previous works.

   abstract = {The Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) provides a unique way to map the large-scale structure of the universe as traced by massive clusters of galaxies. As a spectral distortion of the cosmic microwave background, the SZE is insensitive to the redshift of the galaxy cluster, making it well-suited for studies of clusters at all redshifts, and especially at reasonably high redshifts (z > 1) where the abundance of clusters is critically dependent on the underlying cosmology. Recent high signal-to-noise detections of the SZE have enabled interesting constraints on the Hubble constant and on the matter density of the universe using small samples of galaxy clusters. Upcoming SZE surveys are expected to find hundreds to thousands of new galaxy clusters, with a mass selection function that is remarkably uniform with redshift. In this review we provide an overview of the SZE and its use for cosmological studies, with emphasis on the cosmology that can, in principle, be extracted from SZE survey yields. We discuss the observational and theoretical challenges that must be met before precise cosmological constraints can be extracted from the survey yields.},

The clusters are selected by their Rc-3.6 mum galaxy color-magnitude relation using the cluster red-sequence algorithm. Using this cluster sample, we compute the 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 mum cluster LFs. Similar to previous studies, we find that for the bands that trace stellar mass at these redshifts (3.6 and 4.5 mum) the evolution in M* is consistent with a passively evolving population of galaxies with a high formation redshift (zf>1.5). Using the 3.6 mum LF as a proxy for stellar luminosity, we remove this component from the MIR (5.8 and 8.0 mum) cluster LFs and measure the LF of dusty star formation/AGNs in clusters. We find that at z<0.4 the bright end of the cluster 8.0 mum LF is well described by a composite population of quiescent galaxies and regular star-forming galaxies with a mix consistent with typical cluster blue fractions; however, at z>0.4, an additional population of dusty starburst galaxies is required to properly model the 8.0 mum LFs. Comparison to field studies at similar redshifts shows a strong differential evolution in the field and cluster 8.0 mum LFs with redshift. At z~0.65 8.0 mum-detected galaxies are more abundant in clusters compared to the field, but thereafter the number of 8.0 mum sources in clusters declines with decreasing redshift, and by z~0.15, clusters are underdense relative to the field by a factor of ~5. The rapid differential evolution between the cluster and field LFs is qualitatively consistent with recent field galaxy studies that show that the star formation rates of galaxies in high-density environments are larger than those in low-density environments at higher redshift.},

Our catalogue consists of 439 clusters detected via their Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) signal down to a signal-to-noise ratio of 6, and is more than a factor of 2 larger than the 2013 Planck cluster cosmology sample. The counts are consistent with those from 2013 and yield compatible constraints under the same modelling assumptions. Taking advantage of the larger catalogue, we extend our analysis to the two-dimensional distribution in redshift and signal-to-noise. We use mass estimates from two recent studies of gravitational lensing of background galaxies by Planck clusters to provide priors on the hydrostatic bias parameter, (1-b). In addition, we use lensing of cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature fluctuations by Planck clusters as an independent constraint on this parameter. These various calibrations imply constraints on the present-day amplitude of matter fluctuations in varying degrees of tension with those from the Planck analysis of primary fluctuations in the CMB; for the lowest estimated values of (1-b) the tension is mild, only a little over one standard deviation, while it remains substantial (3.7σ) for the largest estimated value. We also examine constraints on extensions to the base flat ΛCDM model by combining the cluster and CMB constraints. The combination appears to favour non-minimal neutrino masses, but this possibility does little to relieve the overall tension because it simultaneously lowers the implied value of the Hubble parameter, thereby exacerbating the discrepancy with most current astrophysical estimates. Improving the precision of cluster mass calibrations from the current 10%-level to 1% would significantly strengthen these combined analyses and provide a stringent test of the base ΛCDM model.},

After applying a correction for telescope vignetting, the extensive plate overlap regions are used to transform sets of plates onto a common instrumental photometric system.

Observations are 95% complete and provide spectroscopic identification for 500 to 1000 members per cluster, and over 200 background lensed galaxies at z < 7. When combined with a homogeneous set of multi-wavelength ancillary observations, this project will allow a determination of cluster mass density profiles with dynamical and lensing methods and a characterisation of the inner structure of cluster dark matter halos with unprecedented accuracy.

   abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-α-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 Å for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21% with default Glide SP settings to 58% with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63% success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40% of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

   abstract = {One of the central features of the last 8 to 10 billion years of cosmic history has been the emergence of a well-populated red sequence of non-star-forming galaxies. A number of models of galaxy formation and evolution have been devised to attempt to explain this behavior. Most current models require feedback from supermassive black holes (AGN feedback) to quench star formation in galaxies in the centers of their dark matter halos (central galaxies). Such models make the strong prediction that all quenched central galaxies must have a large supermassive black hole (and, by association, a prominent bulge component). I show using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey that the observations are consistent with this prediction. Over 99.5% of red sequence galaxies with stellar masses in excess of 10^\{10\} M_\{\sun\} have a prominent bulge component (as defined by having a Sersic index n above 1.5). Those very rare red sequence central galaxies with little or no bulge (n<1.5) usually have detectable star formation or AGN activity; the fraction of truly quenched bulgeless central galaxies is <0.1% of the total red sequence population. I conclude that a bulge, and by implication a supermassive black hole, is an absolute requirement for full quenching of star formation in central galaxies. This is in agreement with the most basic prediction of the AGN feedback paradigm.},

   abstract = {Exploiting the deep high-resolution imaging of all five CANDELS fields, and accurate redshift information provided by 3D-HST, we investigate the relation between structure and stellar populations for a mass-selected sample of 6764 galaxies above 1010 M , spanning the redshift range 0.5 < z < 2.5. For the first time, we fit two-dimensional models comprising a single Sérsic fit and two-component (i.e., bulge + disk) decompositions not only to the H-band light distributions, but also to the stellar mass maps reconstructed from resolved stellar population modeling. We confirm that the increased bulge prominence among quiescent galaxies, as reported previously based on rest-optical observations, remains in place when considering the distributions of stellar mass. Moreover, we observe an increase of the typical Sérsic index and bulge-to-total ratio (with median B/T reaching 40%-50%) among star-forming galaxies above 1011 M . Given that quenching for these most massive systems is likely to be imminent, our findings suggest that significant bulge growth precedes a departure from the star-forming main sequence. We demonstrate that the bulge mass (and ideally knowledge of the bulge and total mass) is a more reliable predictor of the star-forming versus quiescent state of a galaxy than the total stellar mass. The same trends are predicted by the state-of-the-art, semi-analytic model by Somerville et al. In this model, bulges and black holes grow hand in hand through merging and/or disk instabilities, and feedback from active galactic nuclei shuts off star formation. Further observations will be required to pin down star formation quenching mechanisms, but our results imply that they must be internal to the galaxies and closely associated with bulge growth. © 2014.

   abstract = {The morphological types of galaxies in nine clusters in the redshift range 0.1<z<0.25 are derived from very good seeing images taken at the NOT and the La Silla Danish telescopes. With the purpose of investigating the evolution of the fraction of different morphological types with redshift, we compare our results with the morphological content of nine distant clusters studied by the MORPHS group, five clusters observed with HST-WFPC2 at redshift z = 0.2-0.3, and Dressler's (1980) large sample of nearby clusters. After having checked the reliability of our morphological classification both in an absolute sense and relative to the MORPHS scheme, we analyze the relative occurrence of elliptical, S0 and spiral galaxies as a function of the cluster properties and redshift. We find a large intrinsic scatter in the S0/E ratio, mostly related to the cluster morphology. In particular, in our cluster sample, clusters with a high concentration of ellipticals display a low S0/E ratio and, vice-versa, low concentration clusters have a high S0/E. At the same time, the trend of the morphological fractions and ratios with redshift clearly points to a morphological evolution: as the redshift decreases, the S0 population tends to grow at the expense of the spiral population, whereas the frequency of Es remains almost constant. We also analyze the morphology-density (MD) relation in our clusters and find that -similarly to higher redshift clusters- a good MD relation exists in the high-concentration clusters, while it is absent in the less concentrated clusters. Finally, the comparison of the MD relation in our clusters with that of the D97 sample suggests that the transformation of spirals into S0 galaxies becomes more efficient with decreasing local density.},

Knowledge of their properties provides many useful astrophysical and cosmological information. Aims. Our aim is to derive the luminosity and stellar mass profiles of the nearby galaxy clusters of the Omega-WINGS survey and to study the main scaling relations valid for such systems. Methods. We merged data from the WINGS and Omega-WINGS databases, sorted the sources according to the distance from the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and calculated the integrated luminosity profiles in the B and V bands, taking into account extinction, photometric and spatial completeness, K correction, and background contribution. Then, by exploiting the spectroscopic sample we derived the stellar mass profiles of the clusters. Results. We obtained the luminosity profiles of 46 galaxy clusters, reaching r200 in 30 cases, and the stellar mass profiles of 42 of our objects. We successfully fitted all the integrated luminosity growth profiles with one or two embedded Sérsic components, deriving the main clusters parameters. Finally, we checked the main scaling relation among the clusters parameters in comparison with those obtained for a selected sample of early-type galaxies (ETGs) of the same clusters. Conclusions. We found that the nearby galaxy clusters are non-homologous structures such as ETGs and exhibit a color-magnitude (CM) red-sequence relation very similar to that observed for galaxies in clusters. These properties are not expected in the current cluster formation scenarios. In particular the existence of a CM relation for clusters, shown here for the first time, suggests that the baryonic structures grow and evolve in a similar way at all scales.},

   abstract = {We find that satellite galaxies are responsible for all the environmental effects in our earlier work. The fraction of centrals that are red does not depend on their environment but only on their stellar masses, whereas that of the satellites depends on both. We define a relative satellite quenching efficiency εsat, which is the fraction of blue centrals that are quenched upon becoming the satellite of another galaxy. This is shown to be independent of stellar mass, but to depend strongly on local overdensity, δ, ranging between 0.2 and at least 0.8. The red fraction of satellites correlate much better with the local overdensity δ, a measure of location within the group, than with the richness of the group, i.e., dark matter halo mass. This, and the fact that satellite quenching depends on local density and not on either the stellar mass of the galaxy or the dark matter halo mass, gives clues as to the nature of the satellite-quenching process. We furthermore show that the action of mass quenching on satellite galaxies is also independent of the dark matter mass of the parent halo. We then apply the Peng etal. approach to predict the mass functions of central and satellite galaxies, split into passive and active galaxies, and show that these match very well the observed mass functions from SDSS, further strengthening the validity of this phenomenological approach. We highlight the fact that the observed M* is exactly the same for the star-forming centrals and satellites and the observed M* for the star-forming satellites is independent of halo mass above 1012 M ⊙, which emphasizes the universality of the mass-quenching process that we identified in Peng etal. Post-quenching merging modifies the mass function of the central galaxies but can increase the mass of typical centrals by only about 25%. © 2012. The American Astronomical Society.

   abstract = {The distribution of elements in galaxies provides a wealth of information about their production sites and their subsequent mixing into the interstellar medium. Here we investigate the elemental distributions of stars in the IllustrisTNG simulations. We analyse the abundance ratios of magnesium and europium in Milky Way-like galaxies from the TNG100 simulation (stellar masses log (M*/M⊙) ~ 9.7-11.2). Comparison of observed magnesium and europium for individual stars in the Milky Way with the stellar abundances in our more than 850 Milky Way-like galaxies provides stringent constraints on our chemical evolutionary methods. Here, we use the magnesium-to-iron ratio as a proxy for the effects of our SNII (core-collapse supernovae) and SNIa (Type Ia supernovae) metal return prescription and as a comparison to a variety of galactic observations. The europium-to-iron ratio tracks the rare ejecta from neutron star-neutron star mergers, the assumed primary site of europium production in our models, and is a sensitive probe of the effects of metal diffusion within the gas in our simulations. We find that europium abundances in MilkyWay-like galaxies show no correlation with assembly history, present-day galactic properties, and average galactic stellar population age. We reproduce the europium-to-iron spread at low metallicities observed in the Milky Way, and find it is sensitive to gas properties during redshifts z ≈ 2-4. We show that while the overall normalization of [Eu/Fe] is susceptible to resolution and post-processing assumptions, the relatively large spread of [Eu/Fe] at low [Fe/H] when compared to that at high [Fe/H] is quite robust.},

We estimate the fractions of red and blue galaxies within the main cluster and the detected substructures and study the trends of the colour fractions as a function of the projected distance from the cluster and substructure centres. Our results show that the colours of cluster and substructure members have consistent spatial distributions. In particular, the colour fractions of galaxies inside substructures follow the same spatial trends observed in the main clusters. Additionally, we find that at large cluster-centric distances (r ≥ r200) the fraction of blue galaxies in both the main clusters and in the substructures is always lower than the average fraction of UVJ-selected star-forming galaxies in the field as measured in the COSMOS/UltraVista data set. We finally estimate environmental quenching efficiencies in the clusters and in the substructures and find that at large distances from the cluster centres, the quenching efficiency of substructures becomes comparable to the quenching efficiency of clusters. Our results suggest that pre-processing plays a significant role in the formation and evolution of passive galaxies in clusters at low redshifts.},

   abstract = {We establish a controlled comparison between the properties of galactic stellar haloes obtained with hydrodynamical simulations and with 'particle tagging'. Tagging is a fast way to obtain stellar population dynamics: instead of tracking gas and star formation, it 'paints' stars directly on to a suitably defined subset of dark matter particles in a collisionless, dark-matter-only simulation. Our study shows that 'live' particle tagging schemes, where stellar masses are painted on to the dark matter particles dynamically throughout the simulation, can generate good fits to the hydrodynamical stellar density profiles of a central Milky Way-like galaxy and its most prominent substructure. Energy diffusion processes are crucial to reshaping the distribution of stars in infalling spheroidal systems and hence the final stellar halo. We conclude that the success of any particular tagging scheme hinges on this diffusion being taken into account, and discuss the role of different subgrid feedback prescriptions in driving this diffusion.},

   abstract = {We present six simulations of galactic stellar haloes formed by the tidal disruption of accreted dwarf galaxies in a fully cosmological setting. Our model is based on the Aquarius project, a suite of high-resolution N-body simulations of individual dark matter haloes. We tag subsets of particles in these simulations with stellar populations predicted by the galform semi-analytic model. Our method self-consistently tracks the dynamical evolution and disruption of satellites from high redshift. The luminosity function (LF) and structural properties of surviving satellites, which agree well with observations, suggest that this technique is appropriate. We find that accreted stellar haloes are assembled between 1 < z < 7 from less than five significant progenitors. These progenitors are old, metal-rich satellites with stellar masses similar to the brightest Milky Way dwarf spheroidals (107-108 M⊙). In contrast to previous stellar halo simulations, we find that several of these major contributors survive as self-bound systems to the present day. Both the number of these significant progenitors and their infall times are inherently stochastic. This results in great diversity among our stellar haloes, which amplifies small differences between the formation histories of their dark halo hosts. The masses (∼ 108-109 M⊙) and density/surface-brightness profiles of the stellar haloes (from 10 to 100 kpc) are consistent with expectations from the Milky Way and M31. Each halo has a complex structure, consisting of well-mixed components, tidal streams, shells and other subcomponents. This structure is not adequately described by smooth models. The central regions (<10 kpc) of our haloes are highly prolate (c/a ∼ 0.3), although we find one example of a massive accreted thick disc. Metallicity gradients in our haloes are typically significant only where the halo is built from a small number of satellites. We contrast the ages and metallicities of halo stars with surviving satellites, finding broad agreement with recent observations. © 2010 The Authors. Journal compilation © 2010 RAS.},

   abstract = {We investigate how environment affects satellite galaxies using their location within the projected phase space of their host haloes from the Wang et al.'s group catalogue. Using the Yonsei Zoom-in Cluster Simulations, we derive zones of constant mean infall time Tinf in projected phase space, and catalogue in which zone each observed galaxy falls. Within each zone, we compute the mean observed galaxy properties including specific star formation rate, luminosity-weighted age, stellar metallicity, and [α/Fe] abundance ratio. By comparing galaxies in different zones, we inspect how shifting the mean infall time from recent infallers (Tinf < 3 Gyr) to ancient infallers (Tinf > 5 Gyr) impacts galaxy properties at fixed stellar and halo mass. Ancient infallers are more quenched, and the impact of environmental quenching is visible down to low host masses (≤group masses). Meanwhile, the quenching of recent infallers is weakly dependent on host mass, indicating they have yet to respond strongly to their current environment. [α/Fe] and especially metallicity are less dependent on host mass, but show a dependence on Tinf. We discuss these results in the context of longer exposure times for ancient infallers to environmental effects, which grow more efficient in hosts with a deeper potential well and a denser intracluster medium. We also compare our satellites with a control field sample, and find that even the most recent infallers (Tinf < 2 Gyr) are more quenched than field galaxies, in particular for cluster mass hosts. This supports the role of pre-processing and/or faster quenching in satellites.},

@article{Garcia-Lorenzo2015,
   abstract = {Context. Ionized gas kinematics provide important clues to the dynamical structure of galaxies and hold constraints to the processes driving their evolution.
Aims. The motivation of this work is to provide an overall characterization of the kinematic behavior of the ionized gas of the galaxies included in the Calar Alto Legacy Integral field Area (CALIFA), offering kinematic clues to potential users of the CALIFA survey for including kinematical criteria in their selection of targets for specific studies. From the first 200 galaxies observed by CALIFA survey in its two configurations, we present the two-dimensional kinematic view of the 177 galaxies satisfaying a gas content/detection threshold.
Methods. After removing the stellar contribution, we used the cross-correlation technique to obtain the radial velocity of the dominant gaseous component for each spectrum in the CALIFA data cubes for different emission lines (namely, [O? ii] λλ3726,3729, [O? iii] λλ4959,5007, Hα+[N? ii] λλ6548,6584, and [SII]λλ6716,6730). The main kinematic parameters measured on the plane of the sky were directly derived from the radial velocities with no assumptions on the internal prevailing motions. Evidence of the presence of several gaseous components with different kinematics were detected by using [O? iii] λλ4959,5007 emission line profiles.
Results. At the velocity resolution of CALIFA, most objects in the sample show regular velocity fields, although the ionized-gas kinematics are rarely consistent with simple coplanar circular motions. Thirty-five percent of the objects present evidence of a displacement between the photometric and kinematic centers larger than the original spaxel radii. Only 17% of the objects in the sample exhibit kinematic lopsidedness when comparing receding and approaching sides of the velocity fields, but most of them are interacting galaxies exhibiting nuclear activity (AGN or LINER). Early-type (E+S0) galaxies in the sample present clear photometric-kinematic misaligments. There is evidence of asymmetries in the emission line profiles in 117 out of the 177 analyzed galaxies, suggesting the presence of kinematically distinct gaseous components located at different distances from the optical nucleus. The kinematic decoupling between the dominant and secondary component/s suggested by the observed asymmetries in the profiles can be characterized by a limited set of parameters.
Conclusions. This work constitutes the first determination of the ionized gas kinematics of the galaxies observed in the CALIFA survey. The derived velocity fields, the reported kinematic distortions/peculiarities and the identification of the presence of several gaseous components in different regions of the objects might be used as additional criteria for selecting galaxies for specific studies.},

   abstract = {We present the data release for Galaxy Zoo 2 (GZ2), a citizen science project with more than 16 million morphological classifications of 304 122 galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).Morphology is a powerful probe for quantifying a galaxy's dynamical history; however, automatic classifications of morphology (either by computer analysis of images or by using other physical parameters as proxies) still have drawbacks when compared to visual inspection. The large number of images available in current surveys makes visual inspection of each galaxy impractical for individual astronomers. GZ2 uses classifications from volunteer citizen scientists to measure morphologies for all galaxies in the DR7 Legacy survey with mr > 17, in addition to deeper images from SDSS Stripe 82. While the original GZ2 project identified galaxies as early-types, late-types or mergers, GZ2 measures finer morphological features. These include bars, bulges and the shapes of edge-on disks, as well as quantifying the relative strengths of galactic bulges and spiral arms. This paper presents the full public data release for the project, including measures of accuracy and bias. The majority (\{greater-than or approximate\}90 per cent) of GZ2 classifications agree with those made by professional astronomers, especially for morphological T-types, strong bars and arm curvature.

It is the result of a thorough revision of the major input physics, together with the inclusion of the pre-main sequence phase, not present in our previous releases of stellar models. Another innovative aspect is the possibility of promptly generating accurate opacity tables fully consistent with any selected initial chemical composition, by coupling the Opacity Project At Livermore (OPAL) data at high temperatures to the molecular opacities computed with our æsopus code. In this work, we present extended sets of stellar evolutionary models for various initial chemical compositions, while other sets with different metallicities and/or different distributions of heavy elements are being computed. For the present release of models, we adopt the solar distribution of heavy elements from the recent revision by Caffau et al., corresponding to a Sun's metallicity Z ≃ 0.0152. From all computed sets of stellar tracks, we also derive isochrones in several photometric systems.

ICRF2 contains precise positions of 3414 compact radio astronomical objects and has a positional noise floor of ∼40 μas and a directional stability of the frame axes of ∼10 μas. A set of 295 new "defining" sources was selected on the basis of positional stability and the lack of extensive intrinsic source structure. The positional stability of these 295 defining sources and their more uniform sky distribution eliminates the two greatest weaknesses of the first realization of the International Celestial Reference Frame (ICRF1). Alignment of ICRF2 with the International Celestial Reference System was made using 138 positionally stable sources common to both ICRF2 and ICRF1. The resulting ICRF2 was adopted by the International Astronomical Union as the new fundamental celestial reference frame, replacing ICRF1 as of 2010 January 1.},

   abstract = {We review the results on distances and absolute ages of galactic globular clusters (GCs) obtained after the release of the Hipparcos catalogue. Several methods for the Population II local distance scale are discussed, exploiting NEW RESULTS for RR Lyraes in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We find that the so-called Short and Long Distance Scales may be reconciled whether a consistent reddening scale is adopted for Cepheids and RR Lyrae variables in the LMC. Distances and ages for the 9 clusters discussed in Paper I are re-derived using an enlarged sample of local subdwarfs, which includes about 90% of the metal-poor dwarfs with accurate parallaxes (Delta p/p < 0.12) in the whole Hipparcos catalogue. On average, our revised distance moduli are decreased by 0.04 mag with respect to Paper I. The corresponding age of the GCs is t=11.5+-2.6 Gyr (95% confidence range). The relation between Mv(ZAHB) and metallicity for the nine programme clusters turns out to be Mv(ZAHB)=(0.18+-0.09)([Fe/H]+1.5)+(0.53+-0.12).Thanks to Hipparcos the major contribution to the total error budget associated with the subdwarf fitting technique has been moved from parallaxes to photometric calibrations, reddening and metallicity scale. This total uncertainty still amounts to about +-0.12 mag. Comparing the corresponding (true) LMC distance modulus 18.64+-0.12 mag with other existing determinations, we conclude that at present the best estimate for the distance of the LMC is: 18.54+-0.03+-0.06, suggesting that distances from the subdwarf fitting method are 1 sigma too long. Consequently, our best estimate for the age of the GCs is revised to: Age = 12.9+-2.9 Gyr (95% confidence range). The best relation between Mv(ZAHB) and [Fe/H] is: Mv(ZAHB) =(0.18+-0.09)([Fe/H]+1.5)+(0.63+-0.07).},

   abstract = {We present two new non-parametric methods for quantifying galaxy morphology: the relative distribution of the galaxy pixel flux values (the Gini coefficient or G) and the second-order moment of the brightest 20% of the galaxy's flux (M20). We test the robustness of G and M20 to decreasing signal-to-noise and spatial resolution, and find that both measures are reliable to within 10% at average signal-to-noise per pixel greater than 3 and resolutions better than 1000 pc and 500 pc, respectively. We have measured G and M20, as well as concentration (C), asymmetry (A), and clumpiness (S) in the rest-frame near-ultraviolet/optical wavelengths for 150 bright local "normal" Hubble type galaxies (E-Sd) galaxies and 104 0.05 < z < 0.25 ultra-luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs).We find that most local galaxies follow a tight sequence in G-M20-C, where early-types have high G and C and low M20 and late-type spirals have lower G and C and higher M20. The majority of ULIRGs lie above the normal galaxy G-M20 sequence, due to their high G and M20 values. Their high Gini coefficients arise from very bright nuclei, while the high second-order moments are produced by multiple nuclei and bright tidal tails. All of these features are signatures of recent and on-going mergers and interactions. We also find that in combination with A and S, G is more effective than C at distinguishing ULIRGs from the "normal" Hubble-types. Finally, we measure the morphologies of 45 1.7 < z < 3.8 galaxies from HST NICMOS observations of the Hubble Deep Field North. We find that many of the z $\sim$ 2 galaxies possess G and A higher than expected from degraded images of local elliptical and spiral galaxies, and have morphologies more like low-redshift single nucleus ULIRGs.},

We combine an accurate two-dimensional (2D) multicomponent photometric decomposition with the IFS kinematic properties of their bulges to understand their formation scenario. Our final sample is representative of S0s with high stellar masses (M*/M⊙ > 1010). They lay mainly on the red sequence and live in relatively isolated environments similar to that of the field and loose groups. We use our 2D photometric decomposition to define the size and photometric properties of the bulges, as well as their location within the galaxies. We perform mock spectroscopic simulations mimicking our observed galaxies to quantify the impact of the underlying disc on our bulge kinematic measurements (λ and υ/σ).We compare our bulge corrected kinematic measurements with the results from Schwarzschild dynamical modelling. The good agreement confirms the robustness of our results and allows us to use bulge deprojected values of λ and υ/σ. We find that the photometric (n and B/T) and kinematic (υ/σ and λ) properties of our field S0 bulges are not correlated. We demonstrate that this morpho-kinematic decoupling is intrinsic to the bulges and it is not due to projection effects. We conclude that photometric diagnostics to separate different types of bulges (disc-like versus classical) might not be useful for S0 galaxies. The morpho-kinematics properties of S0 bulges derived in this paper suggest that they are mainly formed by dissipational processes happening at high redshift, but dedicated high-resolution simulations are necessary to better identify their origin.},

   abstract = {We present a two-dimensional (2D) fitting algorithm (GALFIT, ver. 3) with new capabilities to study the structural components of galaxies and other astronomical objects in digital images. Our technique improves on previous 2D fitting algorithms by allowing for irregular, curved, logarithmic and power-law spirals, ring, and truncated shapes in otherwise traditional parametric functions like the Sérsic, Moffat, King, Ferrer, etc., profiles. One can mix and match these new shape features freely, with or without constraints, and apply them to an arbitrary number of model components of numerous profile types, so as to produce realistic-looking galaxy model images. Yet, despite the potential for extreme complexity, the meaning of the key parameters like the Sérsic index, effective radius, or luminosity remains intuitive and essentially unchanged. The new features have an interesting potential for use to quantify the degree of asymmetry of galaxies, to quantify low surface brightness tidal features beneath and beyond luminous galaxies, to allow more realistic decompositions of galaxy subcomponents in the presence of strong rings and spiral arms, and to enable ways to gauge the uncertainties when decomposing galaxy subcomponents. We illustrate these new features by way of several case studies that display various levels of complexity. © 2010. The American Astronomical Society. All rights reserved.},

author = {H. Neilsen, Jr. and Bernstein, Gary and Gruendl, Robert and Kent, Stephen},
abstractNote = {The Dark Energy Survey (DES) is an astronomical imaging survey being completed with the DECam imager on the Blanco telescope at CTIO. After each night of observing, the DES data management (DM) group performs an initial processing of that night's data, and uses the results to determine which exposures are of acceptable quality, and which need to be repeated. The primary measure by which we declare an image of acceptable quality is $\tau$, a scaling of the exposure time. This is the scale factor that needs to be applied to the open shutter time to reach the same photometric signal to noise ratio for faint point sources under a set of canonical good conditions. These conditions are defined to be seeing resulting in a PSF full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 0.9" and a pre-defined sky brightness which approximates the zenith sky brightness under fully dark conditions. Point source limiting magnitude and signal to noise should therefore vary with t in the same way they vary with exposure time. Measurements of point sources and $\tau$ in the first year of DES data confirm that they do. In the context of DES, the symbol $t_{eff}$ and the expression "effective exposure time" usually refer to the scaling factor, $\tau$, rather than the actual effective exposure time; the "effective exposure time" in this case refers to the effective duration of one second, rather than the effective duration of an exposure.},

   abstract = {We present an analysis of the growth of stellar mass with cosmic time partitioned according to galaxy morphology. Using a well-defined catalog of 2150 galaxies based, in part, on archival data in the GOODS fields, we assign morphological types in three broad classes (Ellipticals, Spirals, Peculiar/Irregulars) to a limit of z_AB=22.5 and make the resulting catalog publicly available. We combine redshift information, optical photometry from the GOODS catalog and deep K-band imaging to assign stellar masses. We find little evolution in the form of the galaxy stellar mass function from z~1 to z=0, especially at the high mass end where our results are most robust. Although the population of massive galaxies is relatively well established at z~1, its morphological mix continues to change, with an increasing proportion of early-type galaxies at later times. By constructing type-dependent stellar mass functions, we show that in each of three redshift intervals, E/S0's dominate the higher mass population, while spirals are favored at lower masses. This transition occurs at a stellar mass of 2--3 times 10^\{10\} Msun at z~0.3 (similar to local studies) but there is evidence that the relevant mass scale moves to higher mass at earlier epochs. Such evolution may represent the morphological extension of the ``downsizing'' phenomenon, in which the most massive galaxies stop forming stars first, with lower mass galaxies becoming quiescent later. We infer that more massive galaxies evolve into spheroidal systems at earlier times, and that this morphological transformation may only be completed 1--2 Gyr after the galaxies emerge from their active star forming phase. We discuss several lines of evidence suggesting that merging may play a key role in generating this pattern of evolution.},

   abstract = {As endpoints of the hierarchical mass-assembly process, the stellar populations of local earlytype galaxies encode the assembly history of galaxies over cosmic time. We useHorizon-AGN, a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation, to study the merger histories of local early-type galaxies and track how the morphological mix of their progenitors evolves over time. We provide a framework for alleviating 'progenitor bias' - the bias that occurs if one uses only early-type galaxies to study the progenitor population. Early types attain their final morphology at relatively early epochs - by z ~ 1, around 60 per cent of today's early types have had their last significant merger. At all redshifts, the majority of mergers have one late-type progenitor, with late-late mergers dominating at z > 1.5 and early-early mergers becoming significant only at z < 0.5. Progenitor bias is severe at all but the lowest redshifts - e.g. at z~0.6, less than 50 per cent of the stellar mass in today's early types is actually in progenitors with early-type morphology, while, at z~ 2, studying only early types misses almost all (80 per cent) of the stellar mass that eventually ends up in local early-type systems. At high redshift, almost all massive late-type galaxies, regardless of their local environment or star formation rate, are progenitors of local early-type galaxies, as are lowermass (M* < 1010.5 M⊙) late-types as long as they reside in high-density environments. In this new era of large observational surveys (e.g. LSST, JWST), this study provides a framework for studying how today's early-type galaxies have been built up over cosmic time.},

@book{Hubble1936,
   abstract = {No modern astronomer made a more profound contribution to our understanding of the cosmos than did Edwin Hubble, who first conclusively demonstrated that the universe is expanding. Basing his theory on the observation of the change in spectra of distant galaxies, called red shift, Hubble showed that this is a Doppler effect, or alteration in the wavelength of light, resulting from the rapid motion of celestial objects away from Earth. Hubble's discovery confirmed an equation previously arrived at by Einstein -- who, however, had not trusted his own figures until Hubble proved their accuracy. Hubble supported his theory with careful measurements, but found a rate of expansion (called Hubble's constant) that was far too high because he assumed that other galaxies were much nearer our Milky Way than they are. On the other hand, Hubble's law, relating the distance of a galaxy to its recession velocity, remains essentially unchanged. In 1935 Hubble described his principal observations and conclusions in the Silliman lectures at Yale University. These lectures were published the following year as The Realm of the Nebulae, which quickly became a classic work. It is here reprinted with an introduction by James E. Gunn.},

Seeing effects are computed for elliptically symmetric surface brightness distributions. The widely used assumption of circular symmetry when studying the effects of seeing on intrinsically elliptical sources is shown to produce significant discrepancies with respect to the true effects of seeing on these sources.

   abstract = {I describe a new, open-source astronomical image-fitting program called imfit, specialized for galaxies but potentially useful for other sources, which is fast, flexible, and highly extensible. A key characteristic of the program is an object-oriented design that allows new types of image components (two-dimensional surfacebrightness functions) to be easily written and added to the program. Image functions provided with imfit include the usual suspects for galaxy decompositions (Sérsic, exponential, Gaussian), along with Core-Sérsic and brokenexponential profiles, elliptical rings, and three components that perform line-of-sight integration through threedimensional luminosity-density models of disks and rings seen at arbitrary inclinations. Available minimization algorithms include Levenberg-Marquardt, Nelder-Mead simplex, and Differential Evolution, allowing trade-offs between speed and decreased sensitivity to local minima in the fit landscape. Minimization can be done using the standard χ2 statistic (using either data or model values to estimate per-pixel Gaussian errors, or else user-supplied error images) or Poisson-based maximum-likelihood statistics; the latter approach is particularly appropriate for cases of Poisson data in the low-count regime. I show that fitting low-signal-to-noise ratio galaxy images using χ2 minimization and individual-pixel Gaussian uncertainties can lead to significant biases in fitted parameter values, which are avoided if a Poisson-based statistic is used; this is true even when Gaussian read noise is present.},

We study galaxies in 105 galaxy clusters at $0.015<z<0.060$ detected from Sloan Digital Sky Survey data, in order to examine whether the fraction of star-forming galaxies ($f_\mathrm\{sf\}$) in 16 interacting clusters is enhanced compared with that of the other non-interacting clusters and to investigate the possible connection between the $f_\mathrm\{sf\}$ enhancement and the bar formation in interacting clusters. We find that $f_\mathrm\{sf\}$ is moderately higher ($\sim20\%$) in interacting clusters than in non-interacting clusters and that the enhancement of star formation in interacting clusters occurs only in moderate-mass disk-dominated galaxies ($10^\{10.0\} \le M_\mathrm\{star\}/M_\{\odot\} < 10^\{10.4\}$ and the bulge-to-total light ratio is $\le0.5$).

Stroe et al. revealed unexpected overdensities of candidate Hα emitters near the ~1-Mpc-wide shock fronts of the massive (~2 × 1015 M⊙) 'Sausage' merging cluster, CIZA J2242.8+5301. We used the Keck/Deep Imaging Multi-Object Spectrograph and the William Herschel Telescope/AutoFib2+WYFFOS to confirm 83 Hα emitters in and around the merging cluster. We find that cluster star-forming galaxies in the hottest X-ray gas and/or in the cluster subcores (away from the shock fronts) show high [S II]6716/[S II]6761 and high [S II] 6716/Hα, implying very low electron densities (<30 × lower than all other star-forming galaxies outside the cluster) and/or significant contribution from supernovae, respectively. All cluster star-forming galaxies near the cluster centre show evidence of significant outflows (blueshifted Na D ~200-300 km s-1), likely driven by supernovae. Strong outflows are also found for the cluster Hα active galactic nucleus (AGN). Hα star-forming galaxies in the merging cluster follow the z ~ 0 mass-metallicity relation, showing systematically higher metallicity (~0.15-0.2 dex) than Hα emitters outside the cluster (projected R > 2.5 Mpc). This suggests that the shock front may have triggered remaining metal-rich gas which galaxies were able to retain into forming stars. Our observations show that the merger of impressively massive (~1015 M⊙) clusters can provide the conditions for significant star formation and AGN activity, but, as we witness strong feedback by star-forming galaxies and AGN (and given how massive the merging cluster is), such sources will likely quench in a few 100 Myr.},

We investigate the role of mergers and shocks in shaping the Ha luminosity function, using custom-made narrow-band filters matching the cluster redshifts mounted on the Isaac Newton Telescope. We surveyed ~0.28 deg2 for each cluster and found 181 line emitters in the 'sausage' (volume of 3.371 × 103 Mpc3 for Hα at z = 0.1945) and 141 in the 'toothbrush' (4.546 × 103 Mpc3 for Hα at z = 0.225), out of which 49 ('sausage') and 30 ('toothbrush') are expected to be Hα. We build luminosity functions for the field-of-view down to an average limiting star formation rate of 0.14M⊙ yr-1, find good agreement with field luminosity functions at z = 0.2, but significant differences between the shapes of the luminosity functions for the two clusters. We discover extended, tens-of-kpc-wide Hα haloes in galaxies neighbouring relics, which were possibly disrupted by the passage of the shock wave.

Our numerical simulations show that the external pressure of the ICM, in which cluster member galaxies are embedded, can increase significantly during cluster merging. As such, efficient star formation can be triggered in gas-rich members as a result of the strong compression of their cold gas by the increased pressure. We also suggest that these star-forming galaxies can subsequently be transformed into post-starburst galaxies, with their spatial distribution within the cluster being different than that of the rest of the population. We discuss whether this possible merger-induced enhancement in the number of star-forming and post-star-forming cluster galaxies is consistent with the observed evolution of galaxies in merging clusters. © 2010.

The radio galaxies in A2125 extend over about 5 Mpc (assuming H0 = 75 km s-1 Mpc-1) along a band running from northeast to southwest of the cluster center. About half the radio galaxies are red and have optical spectra that resemble old stellar populations. The other half are blue with emission lines, most of which indicate an origin in star formation rather than AGN. Many of the blue galaxies are in a distinct clump located about 2 Mpc in projection from the cluster center. The excess population of radio galaxies in A2125 occurs entirely at radio luminosities less than 1023 W Hz-1, where one expects star formation to be primarily responsible for the radio emission. Most of these radio galaxies have optical properties most consistent with systems later than E/S0. However, the optical line luminosities are often weaker than one would expect for the star formation rates implied by the radio emission. Thus we suspect that dust obscuration, larger than is usually found locally, hides most of the star-forming regions optically. The existence of a cluster-cluster merger in progress in A2125 seems likely to play some role in these phenomena, although the details are obscure.},

   abstract = {Using our extensive radio, optical, near-IR and X-ray imaging and spectroscopy, we consider the reason for the unusually large number of radio detected galaxies, mostly found outside the cluster core, in Abell 2125 (z=0.2465, richness class 4). With 20-cm VLA data, we detect continuum emission from 90 cluster members. The multiwavelength properties of these galaxies suggest that most of the radio emission is due to an enhanced star-formation rate. The dynamical study of Miller et al (2004) suggests that Abell 2125 is undergoing a major cluster-cluster merger, with our view within 30 degrees of the merger axis and within 0.2 Gyr of core passage. The combination of projection effects and the physical processes at work during this special time in the cluster's evolution seem likely to be responsible for the unusual level of activity we see in the cluster. We argue that tidal effects on individual cluster members, often far from the cluster core, are responsible for the increased star formation. Our results are consistent with the idea that disk galaxies during this phase of a cluster's evolution undergo rapid evolution, through a burst of star formation, on their way to becoming S0's.},

   abstract = {A significant fraction of clusters of galaxies are observed to have substructure, which implies that merging between clusters and subclusters is a rather common physical process of cluster formation. It still remains unclear how cluster merging affects the evolution of cluster member galaxies. We report the results of numerical simulations, which show the dynamical evolution of a gas-rich late-type spiral in a merger between a small group of galaxies and a cluster. The simulations demonstrate that time-dependent tidal gravitational field of the merging excites non-axisymmetric structure of the galaxy, subsequently drives efficient transfer of gas to the central region, and finally triggers a secondary starburst. This result provides not only a new mechanism of starbursts but also a close physical relationship between the emergence of starburst galaxies and the formation of substructure in clusters. We accordingly interpret post-starburst galaxies located near substructure of the Coma cluster as one observational example indicating the global tidal effects of group-cluster merging. Our numerical results furthermore suggest a causal link between the observed excess of blue galaxies in distant clusters and cluster virialization process through hierarchical merging of subclusters.},

   abstract = {The presence of substructure in galaxy groups and clusters is believed to be a sign of recent galaxy accretion and can be used to probe not only the assembly history of these structures, but also the evolution of their member galaxies. Using the Dressler-Shectman (DS) test, we study substructure in a sample of intermediate-redshift (z∼ 0.4) galaxy groups from the Group Environment and Evolution Collaboration (GEEC) group catalogue. We find that four of the 15 rich GEEC groups, with an average velocity dispersion of ∼525kms -1, are identified as having significant substructure. The identified regions of localized substructure lie on the group outskirts and in some cases appear to be infalling. In a comparison of galaxy properties for the members of groups with and without substructure, we find that the groups with substructure have a significantly higher fraction of blue and star-forming galaxies and a parent colour distribution that resembles that of the field population rather than the overall group population. In addition, we observe correlations between the detection of substructure and other dynamical measures, such as velocity distributions and velocity dispersion profiles. Based on this analysis, we conclude that some galaxy groups contain significant substructure and that these groups have properties and galaxy populations that differ from groups with no detected substructure. These results indicate that the substructure galaxies, which lie preferentially on the group outskirts and could be infalling, do not exhibit signs of environmental effects, since little or no star formation quenching is observed in these systems. © 2012 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society © 2012 RAS.},

This cluster is among the better nearby candidates for rich cluster-cluster merger systems, with evidence including an elongated X-ray morphology, the presence of a radio halo, and substructure present in its galaxy distribution. Our radio observations reach an rms sensitivity of ~40 uJy/beam, enabling us to detect (at 5 sigma) star formation rates as low as 1.4 M(sun)/year from the center of the cluster out to a radial distance of 3 Mpc. The radio data are complemented by optical imaging and a large spectroscopic database, allowing us to separate all galaxies with MR < -20 into cluster members and foreground/background galaxies. The spectra are also used to associate the galaxies' radio emission with either star formation or AGN. We compare the resulting cluster radio galaxy population with those of nineteen other nearby Abell clusters, and find strong evidence for an increase in the frequency of radio galaxies in Abell 2255. This increase is seen in two separate types of galaxies: powerful radio AGN and optically-faint star forming galaxies. The optical spectra of the latter often indicate current or recent starbursts, and these galaxies appear to be distributed along an axis perpendicular to the probable merger axis. We assess these factors in light of models of galaxy evolution, and suggest that the cluster-cluster merger is responsible for triggering galaxy activity in Abell 2255.},

We have developed and applied a code for kinematic substructure detection to a sample of 412 galaxy clusters drawn from the Tempel et al. (2012) catalogue, finding a frequency of substructures of 45 per cent. We have extracted mean stellar ages with the starlight spectral synthesis code applied to Sloan Digital Sky Survey III spectra of the sample galaxies. We found lower mean stellar ages in unrelaxed clusters relative to relaxed clusters. For unrelaxed clusters, we separated primary and secondary subhaloes and found that, while relaxed clusters and primaries present similar masses and age distributions, secondaries present younger stellar populations, mainly due to low-mass galaxies (log M∗/M⊙ ≲ 11 dex). An age-clustercentric radius relation is seen for all subhaloes irrespective of the presence of substructures. We also observe relations between the mean stellar age and mass of relaxed and unrelaxed clusters, massive systems presenting higher mean ages. The locus of these relations is distinct between relaxed and unrelaxed clusters, but become indistinguishable when separating primaries and secondaries. Our results suggest that differences between relaxed and unrelaxed clusters are mainly driven by low-mass systems in the clusters outskirts, and that, while pre-processing can be seen in the subcomponents of dynamically young clusters, some evolution in the stellar populations must occur during the clusters relaxation.},

Exploiting constraints derived from Hubble Space Telescope images and Keck longslit spectroscopy, our finding of apparent debris trails and dramatically enhanced star formation rates in an additional seven RPS candidates support the hypothesis that RPS, and hence rapid galaxy evolution in high-density environments, is intricately linked to cluster collisions. Unexpectedly, we find the vast majority of RPS candidates in A1758N to be moving toward us, and in a shared direction as projected on the plane of the sky. We hypothesize that this directional bias is the result of two successive events: (1) the quenching, during and after the first core passage, of star formation in galaxies with an approximately isotropic velocity distribution within the central region of the merger, and (2) RPS events triggered in late-type galaxies falling into the merging system along a filament, possibly enhanced by a shock front expanding into the outskirts of the south-eastern subcluster. Since this explanation implies that the merger axis of A1758N must be significantly inclined with respect to the plane of the sky, our findings open the possibility of RPS events becoming important diagnostic tools to constrain the geometry of cluster collisions that, due to the orientation of the merger axis, lack the classic observational signatures of face-on mergers.},

Using nine different narrow-band filters, we select > 3000 Hα emitters within 19 clusters and their larger scale environment over a total volume of 1.3 × 105 Mpc3. The sample includes both relaxed and merging clusters, covering the 0.15- 0.31 redshift range and spanning from 5 × 1014 to 30 × 1014 M⊙. We find that the Hα luminosity function for merging clusters has a higher characteristic density φ* compared to relaxed clusters. φ* drops from cluster core to cluster outskirts for both merging and relaxed clusters, with the merging cluster values ~0.3 dex higher at each projected radius. The characteristic luminosity L* drops over the 0.5-2.0 Mpc distance from the cluster centre for merging clusters and increases for relaxed objects. Among disturbed objects, clusters hosting large-scale shock waves (traced by radio relics) are overdense in Ha emitters compared to those with turbulence in their intracluster medium (traced by radio haloes). We speculate that the increase in star formation activity in disturbed, young, massive galaxy clusters can be triggered by interactions between gas-rich galaxies, shocks and/or the intracluster medium, as well as accretion of filaments and galaxy groups. Our results indicate that disturbed clusters represent vastly different environments for galaxy evolution compared to relaxed clusters or average field environments.},

   abstract = {We present the mid-infrared (MIR) observation of a nearby galaxy cluster, A2255, by the AKARI space telescope. Using AKARI's continuous wavelength coverage between 3 and 24 μ m and the wide field of view, we investigate the properties of cluster member galaxies to see how the infall of the galaxies, the cluster substructures, and the cluster-cluster merger influence their evolution. We show that the excess of MIR (∼11μm) flux is a good indicator for discriminating galaxies at different evolutionary stages and for dividing galaxies into three classes accordingly: strong MIR-excess (N3-S11 > 0.2) galaxies that include both unobscured and obscured star-forming galaxies; weak MIR-excess (-2.0 < N3-S11 <-1.2) galaxies that are quiescent, old (>5 Gyr) galaxies where the MIR emission arises mainly from the circumstellar dust around AGB stars; and intermediate MIR-excess (-1.2 < N3-S11 < 0.2) galaxies in between the two classes that are less than a few Gyr old past the prime star formation activity. With the MIR-excess diagnostics, we investigate how local and cluster-scale environments affect the individual galaxies. We derive the total star formation rate (SFR) and the specific SFR of A2255 using the strong MIR-excess galaxies. The dust-free, total SFR of A2255 is ∼130M yr-1, which is consistent with the SFRs of other clusters of galaxies at similar redshifts and with similar masses. We find no strong evidence that supports enhanced star formation either inside the cluster or in the substructure region, suggesting that the infall or the cluster merging activities tend to suppress star formation. The intermediate MIR-excess galaxies, representing galaxies in transition from star-forming galaxies to quiescent galaxies, are located preferentially at the medium density region or cluster substructures with higher surface density of galaxies. Our findings suggest that galaxies are being transformed from star-forming galaxies into red, quiescent galaxies from the infall region through near the core which can be explained well by ram-pressure stripping as previous simulation results suggest.We conclude that the cluster merging and the group/galaxy infall suppress star formation and transform galaxies from star-forming galaxies into quiescent galaxies, most likely due to ram-pressure stripping. © 2011 The American Astronomical Society.

The absolute magnitudes of BCGs follow a Gaussian function with a characteristic width of about 0.36 mag. We find that the luminosity function of galaxies in more relaxed clusters has a fainter characteristic absolute magnitude (M*), and these clusters have fewer bright non-BCG member galaxies but a brighter BCG.

We develop a method to diagnose the substructure and dynamical state of galaxy clusters by using photometric data of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). To trace mass distribution, the brightness distribution ofmember galaxies is smoothed by using a Gaussian kernel with a weight of their optical luminosities. After deriving the asymmetry, the ridge flatness and the normalized deviation of the smoothed optical map, we define a relaxation parameter, G\{cyrillic\}, to quantify dynamical state of clusters. This method is applied to a test sample of 98 clusters of 0.05 < z 0.42 collected from literature with known dynamical states and can recognize dynamical state for relaxed (G\{cyrillic\} ≥ 0) and unrelaxed (G\{cyrillic\} < 0) clusters with a success rate of 94 per cent.We then calculate relaxation parameters of 2092 rich clusters previously identified from the SDSS, of which 28 per cent clusters are dynamically relaxed with G\{cyrillic\} ≥ 0.We find that the dominance and absolute magnitude of the brightest cluster galaxies closely correlate with dynamical states of clusters. The emission power of radio haloes is quantitatively related to cluster dynamical state, beside the known dependence on the X-ray luminosity. © 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.},

This review critically examines reports of IMF variations, with a view toward whether other explanations are sufficient given the evidence. Studies of the field, young clusters and associations, and old globular clusters suggest that the vast majority were drawn from a universal system IMF: a power law of Salpeter index (Γ = 1.35) above a few solar masses, and a log normal or shallower power law (Γ ̃ 0-0.25) for lower mass stars. The shape and universality of the substellar IMF is still under investigation. Observations of resolved stellar populations and the integrated properties of most galaxies are also consistent with a universal IMF, suggesting no gross variations over much of cosmic time. Indications of "nonstandard" IMFs in specific local and extragalactic environments clearly warrant further study. However, there is no clear evidence that the IMF varies strongly and systematically as a function of initial conditions after the first few generations of stars. © 2010 by Annual Reviews.},

We find that the Bar experienced a negligible star formation activity in the first few Gyr, followed by a dramatic enhancement from 6 to 4Gyr ago and a nearly constant activity since then. The two examined fields differ both in the rate of star formation and in the ratio of recent over past activity, but share the very low level of initial activity and its sudden increase around 5Gyr ago.

   abstract = {The stellar populations of galaxies hold vital clues to their formation histories. In this paper we present results based on modeling stacked spectra of early-type galaxies drawn from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey as a function of velocity dispersion, σ, from 90 km s-1 to 300 km s -1. The spectra are of extremely high quality, with typical signal-to-noise ratio of 1000 Å-1, and a wavelength coverage of 4000 Å -8800 Å. Our population synthesis model includes variation in 16 elements from C to Ba, a two-component star formation history, the shift in effective temperature, Δ T eff, of the stars with respect to a solar metallicity isochrone, and the stellar initial mass function, among other parameters. In our approach we fit the full optical spectra rather than a select number of spectral indices and are able to, for the first time, measure the abundances of the elements V, Cr, Mn, Co, and Ni from the integrated light of distant galaxies. Our main results are as follows: (1) light-weighted stellar ages range from 6-12 Gyr from low to high σ; (2) [Fe/H] varies by less than 0.1 dex across the entire sample; (3) Mg closely tracks O, and both increase from ≈0.0 at low σ to ∼0.25 at high σ; Si and Ti show a shallower rise with σ, and Ca tracks Fe rather than O; (4) the iron peak elements V, Cr, Mn, and Ni track Fe, while Co tracks O, suggesting that Co forms primarily in massive stars; (5) C and N track O over the full sample and [C/Fe] and [N/Fe] exceed 0.2 at high σ; and (6) the variation in Δ T eff with total metallicity closely follows theoretical predictions based on stellar evolution theory. This last result is significant because it implies that we are robustly solving not only for the detailed abundance patterns but also the detailed temperature distributions (i.e., isochrones) of the stars in these galaxies. A variety of tests reveal that the systematic uncertainties in our measurements are probably 0.05 dex or less. Our derived [Mg/Fe] and [O/Fe] abundance ratios are 0.05-0.1 dex lower than most previous determinations. Under the conventional interpretation that the variation in these ratios is due to star formation timescale variations, our results suggest longer star formation timescales for massive early-type galaxies than previous studies. Detailed chemical evolution models are necessary in order to translate the abundance ratio distributions of these galaxies into constraints on their formation histories. Alternatively, these data may provide useful constraints on the nucleosynthetic pathways for elements whose production is not well understood. © 2014. The American Astronomical Society.

Recent advances pertaining to the statistics of galaxy morphology include sophisticated measures of concentration (C), asymmetry (A) and clumpiness (S). In this study, these three parameters (CAS) have been applied to a suite of simulated galaxies and compared with observational results inferred from a sample of nearby galaxies. The simulations span a range of late-type systems, with masses between ∼1010 and ∼1012 M⊙, and employ star formation density thresholds between 0.1 and 100cm-3. We have found that the simulated galaxies possess comparable concentrations to their observed counterparts. However, the results of the CAS analysis revealed that the simulated galaxies are generally more asymmetric, and that the range of clumpiness values extends beyond the range of those observed. Strong correlations were obtained between the three CAS parameters and colour (B-V), consistent with observed galaxies. Furthermore, the simulated galaxies possess strong links between their CAS parameters and Hubble type, mostly in-line with their observed counterparts. © 2011 The Authors Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society © 2011 RAS.},

   abstract = {We present deep HST ACS/WFC photometry of the dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 1569, one of the closest and strongest nearby starburst galaxies. These data allow us, for the first time, to unequivocally detect the tip of the red giant branch and thereby determine the distance to NGC 1569. We find that this galaxy is 3.36 ± 0.20 Mpc away, considerably farther away than the typically assumed distance of 2.2 ± 0.6 Mpc. Previously thought to be an isolated galaxy due to its shorter distance, our new distance firmly establishes NGC 1569 as a member of the IC 342 group of galaxies. The higher density environment may help explain the starburst nature of NGC 1569, since starbursts are often triggered by galaxy interactions. On the other hand, the longer distance implies that NGC 1569 is an even more extreme starburst galaxy than previously believed. Previous estimates of the rate of star formation for stars younger than ≤1 Gyr become stronger by more than a factor of 2. Stars older than this were not constrained by previous studies. The dynamical masses of NGC 1569's three super star clusters, which are already known as some of the most massive ever discovered, increase by-53% to (6-7) x 10 5  M ⊙ . © 2008.

   abstract = {I start by providing an updated summary of the penalized pixel-fitting (PPXF) method that is used to extract the stellar and gas kinematics, as well as the stellar population of galaxies, via full spectrum fitting. I then focus on the problem of extracting the kinematics when the velocity dispersion s is smaller than the velocity sampling ΔV that is generally, by design, close to the instrumental dispersion σinst. The standard approach consists of convolving templates with a discretized kernel, while fitting for its parameters. This is obviously very inaccurate when σ≲ ΔV /2, due to undersampling. Oversampling can prevent this, but it has drawbacks. Here I present a more accurate and efficient alternative. It avoids the evaluation of the undersampled kernel and instead directly computes its well-sampled analytic Fourier transform, for use with the convolution theorem. A simple analytic transform exists when the kernel is described by the popular Gauss-Hermite parametrization (which includes the Gaussian as special case) for the line-of-sight velocity distribution. I describe how this idea was implemented in a significant upgrade to the publicly available PPXF software. The key advantage of the new approach is that it provides accurate velocities regardless of σ. This is important e.g. for spectroscopic surveys targeting galaxies with σ ≪σinst, for galaxy redshift determinations or for measuring line-of-sight velocities of individual stars. The proposed method could also be used to fix Gaussian convolution algorithms used in today's popular software packages.},

   abstract = {We use a suite of N-body simulations that incorporate massive neutrinos as an extra-set of particles to investigate their effect on the halo mass function. We show that for cosmologies with massive neutrinos the mass function of dark matter haloes selected using the spherical overdensity (SO) criterion is well reproduced by the fitting formula of Tinker et al. (2008) once the cold dark matter power spectrum is considered instead of the total matter power, as it is usually done. The differences between the two implementations, i.e. using P cdm(k) instead of Pm(k), are more pronounced for large values of the neutrino masses and in the high end of the halo mass function: in particular, the number of massive haloes is higher when Pcdm(k) is considered rather than Pm(k). As a quantitative application of our findings we consider a Planck-like SZ-clusters survey and show that the differences in predicted number counts can be as large as 30% for ∑m ν = 0.4 eV. Finally, we use the Planck-SZ clusters sample, with an approximate likelihood calculation, to derive Planck-like constraints on cosmological parameters. We find that, in a massive neutrino cosmology, our correction to the halo mass function produces a shift in the σ8(Ωm/0.27)γ relation which can be quantified as Δγ ∼ 0.05 and Δγ ∼ 0.14 assuming one (Nν = 1) or three (Nν = 3) degenerate massive neutrino, respectively. The shift results in a lower mean value of σ8 with Δσ8 = 0.01 for Nν = 1 and Δσ8 = 0.02 for Nν = 3, respectively. Such difference, in a cosmology with massive neutrinos, would increase the tension between cluster abundance and Planck CMB measurements. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab srl.},

   abstract = {We use the Millennium Simulation (MS) to study the statistics of Λ cold dark matter (ΛCDM) halo concentrations at z = 0. Our results confirm that the average halo concentration declines monotonically with mass; the concentration-mass relation is well fitted by a power law over three decades in mass, up to the most massive objects that form in a ΛCDM universe (∼ 10 15 h -1 M ⊙). This is in clear disagreement with the predictions of the model proposed by Bullock et al. for these rare objects, and agrees better with the original predictions of Navarro, Frenk & White. The large volume surveyed, together with the unprecedented numerical resolution of the MS, allows us to estimate with confidence the distribution of concentrations and, consequently, the abundance of systems with unusual properties. About one in a hundred cluster haloes (M 200 ≳ 3 × 10 14 h -1 M ⊙) have concentrations exceeding c 200 = 7.5, a result that may be useful in interpreting the likelihood of unusually strong massive gravitational lenses, such as Abell 1689, in the ΛCDM cosmogony. A similar fraction of about 1 per cent of galaxy-sized haloes (M 200 ∼ 10 12 h -1 M ⊙) have c 200 < 4.5 and this could be relevant to models that attempt to reconcile the ΛCDM cosmology with rotation curves of low surface brightness galaxies by appealing to haloes of unexpectedly low concentration. We find that halo concentrations are independent of spin once haloes manifestly out of equilibrium have been removed from the sample. Compared to their relaxed brethren, the concentrations of out-of-equilibrium haloes tend to be lower and have more scatter, while their spins tend to be higher. A number of previously noted trends within the halo population are induced primarily by these properties of unrelaxed systems. Finally, we compare the result of predicting halo concentrations using the mass assembly history of the main progenitor with predictions based on simple arguments regarding the assembly time of all progenitors. The latter are typically as good or better than the former, suggesting that halo concentration depends not only on the evolutionary path of a halo's main progenitor, but on how and when all of its constituents collapsed to form non-linear objects. © 2007 The Authors.

The approach is based on adaptive hierarchical refinement of friends-of-friends groups in six phase-space dimensions and one time dimension, which allows for robust (grid-independent, shape-independent, and noise-resilient) tracking of substructure; as such, it is named ROCKSTAR (Robust Overdensity Calculation using K-Space Topologically Adaptive Refinement). Our method is massively parallel (up to 105 CPUs) and runs on the largest current simulations (>1010 particles) with high efficiency (10 CPU hours and 60 gigabytes of memory required per billion particles analyzed). A previous paper has shown ROCKSTAR to have excellent recovery of halo properties; we expand on these comparisons with more tests and higher-resolution simulations. We show a significant improvement in substructure recovery compared to several other halo finders and discuss the theoretical and practical limits of simulations in this regard. Finally, we present results that demonstrate conclusively that dark matter halo cores are not at rest relative to the halo bulk or substructure average velocities and have coherent velocity offsets across a wide range of halo masses and redshifts. For massive clusters, these offsets can be up to 350 km s-1 at z = 0 and even higher at high redshifts. Our implementation is publicly available at http://code.google. com/p/rockstar. © 2013.

This initial suite consists of the first 24 halos of the $Caterpillar$ $Project$ (www.caterpillarproject.org) whose project goal of 60 - 70 halos will be made public when complete. We resolve $\sim$20,000 gravitationally bound subhalos within the virial radius of each host halo. Over the ranges set by our spatial resolution our convergence is excellent and improvements were made upon current state-of-the-art halo finders to better identify substructure at such high resolutions (e.g., on average we recover $\sim$4 subhalos in each host halo above 10$^8$ M$_\odot$ which would have otherwise not been found using conventional methods). For our relaxed halos, the inner profiles are reasonably fit by Einasto profiles ($\alpha$ = 0.169 $\pm$ 0.023) though this depends on the relaxed nature and assembly history of a given halo. Averaging over all halos, the substructure mass fraction is $f_\{m,subs\} = 0.121 \pm 0.041$, and mass function slope is d$N$/d$M\propto M^\{-1.88 \pm 0.10\}$ though we find scatter in the normalizations for fixed halo mass due to more concentrated hosts having less subhalos at fixed subhalo mass. There are no biases stemming from Lagrangian volume selection as all Lagrangian volume types are included in our sample. Our detailed contamination study of 264 low resolution halos has resulted in obtaining very large and unprecedented, high-resolution regions around our host halos for our target resolution (sphere of radius $\sim$$1.4 \pm 0.4$ Mpc) allowing for accurate studies of low mass dwarf galaxies at large galactocentric radii and the very first stellar systems at high redshift ($z \geq$ 10).},

   abstract = {We discuss the cosmological simulation code GADGET-2, a new massively parallel TreeSPH code, capable of following a collisionless fluid with the N-body method, and an ideal gas by means of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our implementation of SPH manifestly conserves energy and entropy in regions free of dissipation, while allowing for fully adaptive smoothing lengths. Gravitational forces are computed with a hierarchical multipole expansion, which can optionally be applied in the form of a TreePM algorithm, where only short-range forces are computed with the 'tree' method while long-range forces are determined with Fourier techniques. Time integration is based on a quasi-symplectic scheme where long-range and short-range forces can be integrated with different time-steps. Individual and adaptive short-range time-steps may also be employed. The domain decomposition used in the parallelization algorithm is based on a space-filling curve, resulting in high flexibility and tree force errors that do not depend on the way the domains are cut. The code is efficient in terms of memory consumption and required communication bandwidth. It has been used to compute the first cosmological N-body simulation with more than 1010 dark matter particles, reaching a homogeneous spatial dynamic range of 105 per dimension in a three-dimensional box. It has also been used to carry out very large cosmological SPH simulations that account for radiative cooling and star formation, reaching total particle numbers of more than 250 million. We present the algorithms used by the code and discuss their accuracy and performance using a number of test problems. GADGET-2 is publicly released to the research community. © 2005 RAS.},

   abstract = {We analyse two analytic fitting profiles to model the ram pressure exerted over satellites galaxies for different environments and epochs, using hydrodynamical resimulations of groups and clusters of galaxies to measure the ram pressure from the gas particle distribution. First, we compare the predictions given by a known $\beta$-profile model with the simulation measurements, finding that the profile is not in agreement with the expected behaviour by missing the dependence with the halo mass and halocentric distance. It features a systematic underestimation of the predicted ram pressure at high redshifts ($z > 1.5$), which increases towards the central regions of the halos and it is independent of halo mass, reaching differences larger than two decades for satellites at $r < 0.4 R_\mathrm\{vir\}$. This behaviour reverses as redshift decreases, featuring an increasing over-estimation with halocentric distance at $z = 0$. As an alternative, we introduce a new universal analytic model for the profiles consisting in a damped power law, and we provide a new set of fitted parameters which can recover the ram pressure dependence on halo mass and redshifts. Finally, we analyse the impact of these analytic profiles in the galaxy properties by applying a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation and evolution on top of the simulations. We find the number of galaxies experiencing large amounts of accumulated ram pressure stripping have low stellar mass ($M_\star \leq 10^9 \mathrm\{M\}_\odot$), and their specific star formation rates depend significantly on the ram pressure modelling, particularly at high redshifts ($z > 1.5$).},

Updated physics include: gas accretion, ejection due to feedback, and reincorporation via the galactic fountain; a new gas cooling--radio mode active galactic nucleus (AGN) heating cycle; AGN feedback in the quasar mode; a new treatment of gas in satellite galaxies; and galaxy mergers, disruption, and the build-up of intra-cluster stars.

Modern simulations model dark matter, dark energy and ordinary matter in an expanding space-time starting from well-defined initial conditions. The modelling of ordinary matter is most challenging due to the large array of physical processes affecting this component.

   abstract = {The field of galaxy formation and evolution synthesizes the physics of baryons and dark matter to describe the origin of systems such as the Milky Way and the enormous diversity of the galaxy population. The broad variation in possible formation histories and the wide range of cosmic environments make large statistical samples of galaxies essential for identifying the important physical mechanisms that govern their formation. Starting in the early 2020s, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will provide an unmatched dataset for galaxy evolution studies by observing the entire southern sky in ultraviolet, optical and near-infrared wavelengths, producing multi-epoch digital images over a 10-year nominal mission that when summed will provide the deepest, wide-angle view of our Universe ever assembled. Here, we discuss the importance of LSST for deepening our understanding of galaxy formation and evolution over cosmic time. We present some outstanding problems in the field that LSST will address, and we present a roadmap of some preparatory research efforts required to make effective use of the LSST dataset for galaxy formation science.},

   abstract = {Modeling galaxy formation in a cosmological context presents one of the greatest challenges in astrophysics today due to the vast range of scales and numerous physical processes involved. Here we review the current status of models that employ two leading techniques to simulate the physics of galaxy formation: semianalytic models and numerical hydrodynamic simulations. We focus on a set of observational targets that describe the evolution of the global and structural properties of galaxies from roughly cosmic high noon (z ∼ 2-3) to the present. Although minor discrepancies remain, overall, models show remarkable convergence among different methods and make predictions that are in qualitative agreement with observations. Modelers have converged on a core set of physical processes that are critical for shaping galaxy properties. This core set includes cosmological accretion, strong stellar-driven winds that are more efficient at low masses, black hole feedback that preferentially suppresses star formation at high masses, and structural and morphological evolution through merging and environmental processes. However, all cosmological models currently adopt phenomenological implementations of many of these core processes, which must be tuned to observations. Many details of how these diverse processes interact within a hierarchical structure formation setting remain poorly understood. Emerging multiscale simulations are helping to bridge the gap between stellar and cosmological scales, placing models on a firmer, more physically grounded footing. Concurrently, upcoming telescope facilities will provide new challenges and constraints for models, particularly by directly constraining inflows and outflows through observations of gas in and around galaxies.},

   abstract = {Over the past two decades, an avalanche of new data from multiwavelength imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy element production, and reionization of the Universe from the cosmic "dark ages" to the present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after the Big Bang, at z≈1.9, and declined exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9 Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a redshift z = 1.3. About 25% formed before the peak of the cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25% formed after z = 0.7. Less than ∼1% of today's stars formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The comoving rates of star formation and central black hole accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z = 6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological reionization.

   abstract = {We develop a model for the metal enrichment of the intracluster medium (ICM) that combines a cosmological non-radiative hydrodynamical N-body/SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamic) simulation of a cluster of galaxies, and a semi-analytic model of galaxy formation. The novel feature of our hybrid model is that the chemical properties of the diffuse gas in the underlying simulation are dynamically and consistently generated from stars in the galaxies. We follow the production of several chemical elements, provided by low- and intermediate-mass stars, core collapse and Type Ia supernovae. We analyse the spatial distribution of metals in the ICM, investigate the way in which the chemical enrichment proceeds and use iron emissivity as a tracer of gas motions. The similar abundance patterns developed by O and Fe indicate that both types of supernovae pollute the ICM in a similar fashion. Their radial abundance profiles are enhanced in the inner in the last Gyr because of the convergence of enriched gas clumps to the cluster centre; this increment cannot be explained by the metal ejection of cluster galaxies which is quite low at the present epoch. Our results support a scenario in which part of the central intracluster gas comes from gas clumps that, in the redshift range of z∼ 0.2 to 0.5, have been enriched to solar values and are at large distances from the cluster centre (from ∼1 to 6 h-1 Mpc) moving at very high velocities (from ∼1300 to 2500 km s-1). The turbulent gas motions within the cluster, originated in the inhomogeneous gas infall during the cluster assembly, are manifested in emission-weighted velocity maps as gradients that can be as large as over distances of a few hundred kpc. Gradients of this magnitude are also seen in velocity distributions along sightlines through the cluster centre. Doppler shifting and broadening suffered by the Fe K α 6.7-keV emission line along such sightlines could be used to probe these gas large-scale motions when they are produced within an area characterized by high iron line emissivity. © 2006 RAS.},

We show that the effective search volumes for the recently discovered SDSS--satellites depend strongly on their luminosity, with their maximum distance, $D_\{max\}$, substantially smaller than the Milky Way halo's virial radius. Calculating the maximum accessible volume, $V_\{max\}$, for all faint detected satellites, allows the calculation of the luminosity function for Milky Way satellite galaxies, accounting quantitatively for their detectability. We find that the number density of satellite galaxies continues to rise towards low luminosities, but may flatten at $M_V \sim -5$; within the uncertainties, the luminosity function can be described by a single power law $dN/dM_\{V\}= 10 \times 10^\{0.1 (M_V+5)\}$, spanning luminosities from $M_V=-2$ all the way to the luminosity of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Comparing these results to several semi-analytic galaxy formation models, we find that their predictions differ significantly from the data: either the shape of the luminosity function, or the surface brightness distributions of the models, do not match.},

These predictions are based on a newly available library of observed stellar spectra. We also compute the spectral evolution across a larger wavelength range, from 91 Å to 160 μm, at lower resolution. The model incorporates recent progress in stellar evolution theory and an observationally motivated prescription for thermally pulsing stars on the asymptotic giant branch. The latter is supported by observations of surface brightness fluctuations in nearby stellar populations. We show that this model reproduces well the observed optical and near-infrared colour-magnitude diagrams of Galactic star clusters of various ages and metallicities. Stochastic fluctuations in the numbers of stars in different evolutionary phases can account for the full range of observed integrated colours of star clusters in the Magellanic Clouds. The model reproduces in detail typical galaxy spectra from the Early Data Release (EDR) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We exemplify how this type of spectral fit can constrain physical parameters such as the star formation history, metallicity and dust content of galaxies. Our model is the first to enable accurate studies of absorption-line strengths in galaxies containing stars over the full range of ages. Using the highest-quality spectra of the SDSS EDR, we show that this model can reproduce simultaneously the observed strengths of those Lick indices that do not depend strongly on element abundance ratios. The interpretation of such indices with our model should be particularly useful for constraining the star formation histories and metallicities of galaxies.},

   abstract = {We present stellar locus regression (SLR), a method of directly adjusting the instrumental broadband optical colors of stars to bring them into accord with a universal stellar color-color locus, producing accurately calibrated colors for both stars and galaxies. This is achieved without first establishing individual zero points for each passband, and can be performed in real-time at the telescope. We demonstrate how SLR naturally makes one wholesale correction for differences in instrumental response, for atmospheric transparency, for atmospheric extinction, and for Galactic extinction. We perform an example SLR treatment of Sloan Digital Sky Survey data over a wide range of Galactic dust values and independently recover the direction and magnitude of the canonical Galactic reddening vector with 14-18 mmag rms uncertainties. We then isolate the effect of atmospheric extinction, showing that SLR accounts for this and returns precise colors over a wide range of air mass, with 5-14 mmag rms residuals. We demonstrate that SLR-corrected colors are sufficiently accurate to allow photometric redshift estimates for galaxy clusters (using red sequence galaxies) with an uncertainty σ(z)/(1 + z) = 0.6% per cluster for redshifts 0.09 < z < 0.25. Finally, we identify our objects in the 2MASS all-sky catalog, and produce i-band zero points typically accurate to 18 mmag using only SLR. We offer open-source access to our IDL routines, validated and verified for the implementation of this technique, at http://stellar-locus- regression.googlecode.com. © 2009.

   abstract = {We present a full-sky 100 km map that is a reprocessed composite of the COBE/DIRBE and IRAS/ ISSA maps, with the zodiacal foreground and conÐrmed point sources removed. Before using the ISSA maps, we remove the remaining artifacts from the IRAS scan pattern. Using the DIRBE 100 and 240 km data, we have constructed a map of the dust temperature so that the 100 km map may be converted to a map proportional to dust column density. The dust temperature varies from 17 to 21 K, which is modest but does modify the estimate of the dust column by a factor of 5. The result of these manipulations is a map with DIRBE quality calibration and IRAS resolution. A wealth of Ðlamentary detail is apparent on many di †erent scales at all Galactic latitudes. In high-latitude regions, the dust map correlates well with maps of H I emission, but deviations are coherent in the sky and are especially conspicuous in regions of saturation of H I emission toward denser clouds and of formation of in molecular clouds. In contrast, H 2 high-velocity H I clouds are deÐcient in dust emission, as expected. To generate the full-sky dust maps, we must Ðrst remove zodiacal light contamination, as well as a possible cosmic infrared background (CIB). This is done via a regression analysis of the 100 km DIRBE map against the Leiden-Dwingeloo map of H I emission, with corrections for the zodiacal light via a suitable expansion of the DIRBE 25 km Ñux. This procedure removes virtually all traces of the zodiacal foreground. For the 100 km map no signiÐcant CIB is detected. At longer wavelengths, where the zodia-cal contamination is weaker, we detect the CIB at surprisingly high Ñux levels of 32 ^ 13 nW m~2 sr~1 at 140 km and of 17 ^ 4 nW m~2 sr~1 at 240 km (95% conÐdence). This integrated Ñux D2 times that extrapolated from optical galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field. The primary use of these maps is likely to be as a new estimator of Galactic extinction. To calibrate our maps, we assume a standard reddening law and use the colors of elliptical galaxies to measure the reddening per unit Ñux density of 100 km emission. We Ðnd consistent calibration using the B[R color distribution of a sample of the 106 brightest cluster ellipticals, as well as a sample of 384 ellipticals with B[V and Mg line strength measurements. For the latter sample, we use the correlation of intrinsic B[V versus index to tighten the power of the test greatly. We demonstrate that the new maps are Mg 2 twice as accurate as the older Burstein-Heiles reddening estimates in regions of low and moderate reddening. The maps are expected to be signiÐcantly more accurate in regions of high reddening. These dust maps will also be useful for estimating millimeter emission that contaminates cosmic microwave background radiation experiments and for estimating soft X-ray absorption. We describe how to access our maps readily for general use.

   abstract = {The Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) are rich resources for studying stellar astrophysics and the structure and formation history of the Galaxy. As new surveys and instruments adopt similar filter sets, it is increasingly important to understand the properties of the ugriz JHK s stellar locus, both to inform studies of ''normal'' main-sequence stars and enable robust searches for point sources with unusual colors. Using a sample of $600,000 point sources detected by SDSS and 2MASS, we tabulate the position and width of the ugrizJHK s stellar locus as a function of g À i color, and provide accurate polynomial fits. We map the Morgan-Keenan spectral type sequence to the median stellar locus by using synthetic photometry of spectral standards and by analyzing 3000 SDSS stellar spectra with a custom spectral typing pipeline, described in the Appendix to this paper. We develop an algorithm to calculate a point source's minimum separation from the stellar locus in a seven-dimensional color space, and use it to robustly identify objects with unusual colors, as well as spurious SDSS/2MASS matches. Analysis of a final catalog of 2117 color outliers identifies 370 white-dwarf/M dwarf (WDMD) pairs, 93 QSOs, and 90 M giant/carbon star candidates, and demonstrates that WDMD pairs and QSOs can be distinguished on the basis of their J À K s and r À z colors. We also identify a group of objects with correlated offsets in the u À g versus g À r and g À r versus r À i color-color spaces, but subsequent follow-up is required to reveal the nature of these objects. Future applications of this algorithm to a matched SDSS-UKIDSS catalog may well identify additional classes of objects with unusual colors by probing new areas of color-magnitude space.},

   abstract = {We describe a standard star catalog constructed using multiple SDSS photometric observations (at least four per band, with a median of 10) in the ugriz system. The catalog includes 1.01 million nonvariable unresolved objects from the equatorial stripe 82 (j J2000:0 j< 1:266) in the right ascension range 20 h 34 m Y 4 h 00 m and with the corresponding r-band (approximately Johnson V-band) magnitudes in the range 14Y22. The distributions of measurements for individual sources demonstrate that the photometric pipeline correctly estimates random photometric errors, which are below 0.01 mag for stars brighter than 19.5, 20.5, 20.5, 20, and 18.5 in ugriz, respectively (about twice as good as for individual SDSS runs). Several independent tests of the internal consistency suggest that the spatial variation of pho-tometric zero points is not larger than $0.01 mag (rms). In addition to being the largest available data set with optical photometry internally consistent at the $1% level, this catalog provides a practical definition of the SDSS photomet-ric system. Using this catalog, we show that photometric zero points for SDSS observing runs can be calibrated within a nominal uncertainty of 2% even for data obtained through 1 mag thick clouds, and we demonstrate the existence of He and H white dwarf sequences using photometric data alone. Based on the properties of this catalog, we conclude that upcoming large-scale optical surveys such as the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope will be capable of delivering robust 1% photometry for billions of sources.},

   abstract = {We present measurements of dust reddening using the colors of stars with spectra in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. We measure reddening as the difference between the measured and predicted colors of a star, as derived from stellar parameters from the Sloan Extension for Galactic Understanding and Exploration Stellar Parameter Pipeline. We achieve uncertainties of 56, 34, 25, and 29mmag in the colors u - g, g - r, r - i, and i - z, per star, though the uncertainty varies depending on the stellar type and the magnitude of the star. The spectrum-based reddening measurements confirm our earlier "blue tip" reddening measurements, finding reddening coefficients different by -3%, 1%, 1%, and 2% in u - g, g - r, r - i, and i - z from those found by the blue tip method, after removing a 4% normalization difference. These results prefer an RV = 3.1 Fitzpatrick reddening law to O'Donnell or Cardelli et al. reddening laws. We provide a table of conversion coefficients from the Schlegel et al. (SFD) maps of E(B - V) to extinction in 88 bandpasses for four values of RV , using this reddening law and the 14% recalibration of SFD first reported by Schlafly et al. and confirmed in this work. © 2011.

   abstract = {We present a first cosmological analysis of a refined cluster catalog from the Red-Sequence Cluster Survey (RCS). The input cluster sample is derived from the deepest 72.07 deg 2 of the RCS images, which probe to the highest redshift and lowest mass limits. The catalog contains 956 clusters over 0:35 < z < 0:95, limited by cluster richness and richness error. The calibration of the survey images has been extensively cross-checked against publicly available Sloan Digital Sky Survey imaging, and the cluster redshifts and richness that result from this well-calibrated subset of data are robust. We analyze the cluster sample via a general self-calibration technique. We fit simultaneously for the matter density, m , the normalization of the power spectrum, 8 , and four parameters describing the calibration of cluster richness to mass, its evolution with redshift, and scatter in the mass-richness relation. The principal goal of this general analysis is to establish the consistency (or lack thereof) between the fitted parameters (both cosmological and cluster mass observables) and available results on both from independent measures. From an unconstrained analysis, the derived values of m and 8 are 0:31 þ0:11 À0:10 and 0:67 þ0:18 À0:13 , respectively. An analysis including Gaussian priors on the slope and zero point of the mass-richness relation gives very similar results: 0:30 þ0:12 À0:11 and 0:70 þ0:27 À0:15. Both analyses are in acceptable agreement with the current literature. The derived parameters describing the mass-richness relation in the unconstrained fit are also eminently reasonable and in good agreement with existing follow-up data on both the RCS-1 and other cluster samples. Our results directly demonstrate that future surveys (optical and otherwise), with much larger samples of clusters, can give constraints competitive with other probes of cosmology.},
