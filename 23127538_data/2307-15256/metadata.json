  "abstract": "The direct deep learning simulation for multi-scale problems remains a challenging issue. In this work, a novel higher-order multi-scale deep Ritz method (HOMS-DRM) is developed for thermal transfer equation of authentic composite materials with highly oscillatory and discontinuous coefficients. In this novel HOMS-DRM, higher-order multi-scale analysis and modeling are first employed to overcome limitations of prohibitive computation and Frequency Principle when direct deep learning simulation. Then, improved deep Ritz method are designed to high-accuracy and mesh-free simulation for macroscopic homogenized equation without multi-scale property and microscopic lower-order and higher-order cell problems with highly discontinuous coefficients. Moreover, the theoretical convergence of the proposed HOMS-DRM is rigorously demonstrated under appropriate assumptions. Finally, extensive numerical experiments are presented to show the computational accuracy of the proposed HOMS-DRM. This study offers a robust and high-accuracy multi-scale deep learning framework that enables the effective simulation and analysis of multi-scale problems of authentic composite materials.",
