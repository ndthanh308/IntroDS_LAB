  "abstract": "In this paper we study existence and uniqueness of solutions to Dirichlet problems as $$\n  \\begin{cases}\n  g(u) -{\\rm div}\\left(\\frac{D u}{\\sqrt{1+|D u|^2}}\\right) = f & \\text{in}\\;Ω,\\\\ \\newline\n  u=0 & \\text{on}\\;\\partialΩ,\n  \\end{cases} $$ where $Ω$ is an open bounded subset of $\\mathbb{R}^N$ ($N\\geq 2$) with Lipschitz boundary, $g:\\mathbb{R}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ is a continuous function and $f$ belongs to some Lebesgue spaces. In particular, under suitable saturation and sign assumptions, we explore the regularizing effect given by the absorption term $g(u)$ in order to get a solutions for data $f$ merely belonging to $L^1(Ω)$ and with no smallness assumptions on the norm. We also prove a sharp boundedness result for data in $L^{N}(Ω)$ as well as uniqueness if $g$ is increasing.",
