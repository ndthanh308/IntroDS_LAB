  "abstract": "The entrapment of bacteria near boundary surfaces is of biological and practical importance, yet the underlying physics is still not well understood. We demonstrate that it is crucial to include a commonly neglected entropic effect arising from the spatial variation of hydrodynamic interactions, through a model that provides analytic explanation of bacterial entrapment in two dimensionless parameters: $α_1$ the ratio of thermal energy to self-propulsion, and $α_2$ an intrinsic shape factor. For $α_1$ and $α_2$ that match an {\\it Escherichia coli} at room temperature, our model quantitatively reproduces existing experimental observations, including two key features that have not been previously resolved: The bacterial \"nose-down\" configuration, and the anticorrelation between the pitch angle and the wobbling angle. Furthermore, our model analytically predicts the existence of an entrapment zone in the parameter space defined by $\\{α_1,α_2\\}$.",
