  "abstract": "Let $p, k, q$ be positive integers with $p-2 \\geqslant k$ and let $K_{p,k}^{q}$ be the generalized pineapple graph which is obtained by joining independent set of $q$ vertices with $k$ vertices of a complete graph $K_{p}.$ In \\cite{TSH2}, Haemers et al. constructed graphs which cospectral with $K_{p,1}^{q}.$ In this paper, we determine all graphs which are cospectral with $K_{p,k}^{q}$ by considering the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix. Moreover, We extend the conclusions of Haemers et al. to a broader context.",
