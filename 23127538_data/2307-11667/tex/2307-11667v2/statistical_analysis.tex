Mean parameter values for the two resonator populations are summarized in Tab.~\ref{tab:ressum}. Though our small-geometry resonators are very sensitive to TLS loss, we see no statistical difference in TLS loss between the small-grain and large-grain devices, despite the difference in grain size (with the large grain size devices being almost twice as big in area). This difference in grain size is similar to that seen in Nb films in Ref.~\cite{Premkumar2021}, where a difference in grain size of a factor of two was correlated with a difference in qubit $T_1$ of almost two, and a difference in resonator TLS loss was also detected.

We refer to recent studies, especially the work by \citet{Lozano2022}, to estimate the number of devices required to adequately sample the device-to-device variation in $F\delta_{\mathrm{TLS}}^0$. With more than ten devices of each grain size, we exceed the number of devices for each variation (choice of control parameter value) in Refs.~\citet{Lozano2022, Alegria2023, Crowley2023, Jia2023}.

The median values of the losses for the untreated Ta resonators on silicon in Ref.~\citet{Lozano2022} are comparable to the large- and small-grain size median losses reported in Fig.~\ref{fig:boxwhiskers}(a). 

Figure.~\ref{fig:litscatterplot} shows that the difference between the large- and small-grain size losses in this study is imperceptible on the same scale as other A/B comparisons, e.g. Refs.~\citet{Alegria2023, Lozano2022}
