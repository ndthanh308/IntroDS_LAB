We perform transmission measurements on CPW resonators mounted to the mixing chamber (MXC) plate of a FormFactor (formerly Janis) JDry 250 dilution refrigerator (DR) at a mixing chamber temperature of $\sim$10 mK using a Keysight PNA N5222B vector network analyzer (VNA). The input power varied over ten orders of magnitude in estimated photon power to accurately extract the dominant two level system (TLS) loss~\cite{GaoThesis}. 

Nominally identical gold-plated oxygen-free high conductivity copper sample boxes house the resonator chips and are mounted to a plate perpendicular to the MXC plate with additional mu-metal shielding surrounding all samples. Two Radiall R583 six-way microwave switches allow multiple samples to be measured on the same pair of coaxial input and output lines.

The transmission data for each resonator ($S_{21}$ of the two-port $S$-parameter matrix measured by the VNA) is first normalized with a circle fit~\cite{Probst2015}, and then fit to a diameter-corrected asymmetric Lorentzian model of the form~\cite{Khalil2012},
%
    \begin{eqnarray}
       S_{21}(f) &=& 1 - \frac{Q_l\ /\ Q_c\ e^{i\phi}}{1 + 2iQ \frac{f - f_0}{f_0}}\label{eq:S21_DCM} \\
       Q_i^{-1} &=& Q_l^{-1} - \mathrm{Re}\left\{\hat{Q}^{-1}_c\right\} \label{eq:Ql_Qi_Qc} \\
       \hat{Q}_c^{-1} &=& Q_c^{-1} e^{i\phi} \label{eq:def_Qchat}
    \end{eqnarray}
%
where $f_0$ is the resonance frequency, $\phi$ is the asymmetry angle, $Q_c$ is coupling quality factor, $Q_l$ is the loaded quality factor, and $Q_i$ is the internal quality factor. These parameters are fit with their corresponding 95\% confidence intervals from a least squares fitting routine~\cite{BCQT_Code}. A secondary fit of the loss $\delta = Q_i^{-1}$ as a function of average number of photons $\left<n_{\mathrm{ph}}\right>$ and fixed temperature $T$ follows from the sum of the TLS loss contribution $\delta_{\mathrm{TLS}}$ and an offset term $1/Q_{\mathrm{HP}}$ that accounts for power-independent losses dominating at higher powers~\cite{McRae2020}
%
    \begin{eqnarray}
        \delta\left(\left<n_{\mathrm{ph}}\right>, T\right) &=&
        \delta_{\mathrm{TLS}}\left(\left<n_{\mathrm{ph}}\right>, T\right) + 1/Q_{\mathrm{HP}}
        \label{eq:def_delta_tot} \\
        \delta_{\mathrm{TLS}}\left(\left<n_{\mathrm{ph}}\right>, T\right)
        &=& F \delta_{\mathrm{TLS}}^0\frac{\tanh\left(\frac{\hbar\omega_0}{k_B T}\right)}%
        {\left(1 + \frac{\left<n_{\mathrm{ph}}\right>}{n_c}\right)^{\beta}}
        \label{eq:def_delta_tls}
    \end{eqnarray}
%
where $n_c$ is the critical photon number at which TLS saturate at low power, $\omega_0=2\pi f_0$ is the angular resonance frequency, $\beta$ is an exponent interpolating between the non-interacting TLS model $\beta=1/2$ and interacting TLS model $\beta < 1/2$~\cite{GaoThesis,Phillips1972, DeGraaf2018}, $\delta_{\mathrm{TLS}}^0$ is the intrinsic TLS loss, $F$ is the geometry-dependent filling factor, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, and $k_B$ is the Boltzmann constant.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:scurves}, we plot the loss power dependence for all large and small grain size devices used in this work. The high power losses are subtracted to emphasize the similar power dependence (line shape) and low power loss (TLS saturation loss) between the two samples, without the confounding factor of high-power losses which are known to be caused by a myriad of sources external to the device materials~\cite{McRae2020}. Figure~\ref{fig:boxwhiskers} further highlights this point, as the medians from the box and whisker plots of the intrinsic TLS losses for the large and small grain size Ta films coincide with one another and their respective histograms give similar variances.
