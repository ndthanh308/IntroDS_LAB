% Conclusion
We performed millikelvin microwave transmission measurements of $\alpha$-phase Ta microwave resonators with both large- and small-grain size sputter-deposited on c-axis sapphire at two different growth temperatures. Structural and chemical analysis reveal that the films differ only in their grain size and not in their surface oxide types and concentrations, and crystal structure. The extracted intrinsic TLS losses show no statistical difference between the two film types, suggesting that, in this materials regime, grain size does not significantly affect millikelvin, ultralow power dieletric loss. We encourage future A/B experimentation to continue to reduce the fabrication parameter space and to identify correlations between other room-temperature materials characterization parameters and low-power, low-temperature microwave performance of devices.
