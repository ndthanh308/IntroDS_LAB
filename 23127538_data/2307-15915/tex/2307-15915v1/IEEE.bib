	abstract = {Graph neural network, as a powerful graph representation technique based on deep learning, has shown superior performance and attracted considerable research interest. However, it has not been fully considered in graph neural network for heterogeneous graph which contains different types of nodes and links. The heterogeneity and rich semantic information bring great challenges for designing a graph neural network for heterogeneous graph. Recently, one of the most exciting advancements in deep learning is the attention mechanism, whose great potential has been well demonstrated in various areas. In this paper, we first propose a novel heterogeneous graph neural network based on the hierarchical attention, including node-level and semantic-level attentions. Specifically, the node-level attention aims to learn the importance between a node and its meta-path based neighbors, while the semantic-level attention is able to learn the importance of different meta-paths. With the learned importance from both node-level and semantic-level attention, the importance of node and meta-path can be fully considered. Then the proposed model can generate node embedding by aggregating features from meta-path based neighbors in a hierarchical manner. Extensive experimental results on three real-world heterogeneous graphs not only show the superior performance of our proposed model over the state-of-the-arts, but also demonstrate its potentially good interpretability for graph analysis.},

	abstract = {Similarity search is a primitive operation in database and Web search engines. With the advent of large-scale heterogeneous information networks that consist of multi-typed, interconnected objects, such as the bibliographic networks and social media networks, it is important to study similarity search in such networks. Intuitively, two objects are similar if they are linked by many paths in the network. However, most existing similarity measures are defined for homogeneous networks. Different semantic meanings behind paths are not taken into consideration. Thus they cannot be directly applied to heterogeneous networks.In this paper, we study similarity search that is defined among the same type of objects in heterogeneous networks. Moreover, by considering different linkage paths in a network, one could derive various similarity semantics. Therefore, we introduce the concept of meta path-based similarity, where a meta path is a path consisting of a sequence of relations defined between different object types (i.e., structural paths at the meta level). No matter whether a user would like to explicitly specify a path combination given sufficient domain knowledge, or choose the best path by experimental trials, or simply provide training examples to learn it, meta path forms a common base for a network-based similarity search engine. In particular, under the meta path framework we define a novel similarity measure called PathSim that is able to find peer objects in the network (e.g., find authors in the similar field and with similar reputation), which turns out to be more meaningful in many scenarios compared with random-walk based similarity measures. In order to support fast online query processing for PathSim queries, we develop an efficient solution that partially materializes short meta paths and then concatenates them online to compute top-k results. Experiments on real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed paradigm.},

	ABSTRACT = {Following advances in machine learning and deep learning processing, cyber security experts are committed to creating deep intelligent approaches for automatically detecting software vulnerabilities. Nowadays, many practices are for C and C++ programs, and methods rarely target PHP application. Moreover, many of these methods use LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) but not GNN (Graph Neural Networks) to learn the token dependencies within the source code through different transformations. That may lose a lot of semantic information in terms of code representation. This article presents a novel Graph Neural Network vulnerability detection approach, VulEye, for PHP applications. VulEye can assist security researchers in finding vulnerabilities in PHP projects quickly. VulEye first constructs the PDG (Program Dependence Graph) of the PHP source code, slices PDG with sensitive functions contained in the source code into sub-graphs called SDG (Sub-Dependence Graph), and then makes SDG the model input to train with a Graph Neural Network model which contains three stack units with a GCN layer, Top-k pooling layer, and attention layer, and finally uses MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) and softmax as a classifier to predict if the SDG is vulnerable. We evaluated VulEye on the PHP vulnerability test suite in Software Assurance Reference Dataset. The experiment reports show that the best macro-average F1 score of the VulEye reached 99% in the binary classification task and 95% in the multi-classes classification task. VulEye achieved the best result compared with the existing open-source vulnerability detection implements and other state-of-art deep learning models. Moreover, VulEye can also locate the precise area of the flaw, since our SDG contains code slices closely related to vulnerabilities with a key triggering sensitive/sink function.},

abstract = {With JavaScript being the most popular programming language on the web, several new JavaScript frameworks are released every year. A well designed framework may help developers create secure applications. The goal of our study is to understand how framework developers can best protect applications developed using their framework. In this work we studied how cross-site request forgery vulnerability is mitigated in several server-side JavaScript frameworks: Express.js, Koa.js, Hapi.js, Sails.js, and Meteor.js. We then analyzed open source applications developed with these frameworks using open source and custom written tools for automated static analysis and identified the percentage of protected applications for each framework. We correlated our analysis results to the implementation levels of mitigating controls in each framework and performed statistical analysis of our results to ensure no other confounding factors were involved. Based on the received outcomes we provide recommendations for framework developers on how to create frameworks that produce secure applications.}
