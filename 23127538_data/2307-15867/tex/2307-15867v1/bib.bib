	title = {Characterization of transient noise in Advanced {LIGO} relevant to gravitational wave signal {GW}150914},
	abstract = {On 14 September 2015, a gravitational wave signal from a coalescing black hole binary system was observed by the Advanced {LIGO} detectors. This paper describes the transient noise backgrounds used to determine the significance of the event (designated GW150914) and presents the results of investigations into potential correlated or uncorrelated sources of transient noise in the detectors around the time of the event. The detectors were operating nominally at the time of GW150914. We have ruled out environmental influences and non-Gaussian instrument noise at either {LIGO} detector as the cause of the observed gravitational wave signal.}

abstract = {The detection of gravitational waves with ground-based laser-interferometric detectors requires sensitivity to changes in distance much smaller than the diameter of atomic nuclei. Though sophisticated machinery and techniques have been developed over the past few decades to isolate such instruments from non-astrophysical noise, the detectors are still susceptible to instrumental and environmental noise transients known as “glitches,” which hinder searches for transient gravitational waves. The Gravity Spy project is an effort to comprehensively classify the glitches that afflict gravitational wave detectors into morphological families by combining the strengths of machine learning algorithms and citizen scientists. This paper presents the initial Gravity Spy dataset used for citizen scientist and machine learning classification – a static, accessible, documented dataset for testing machine learning supervised classification. Previous versions of this dataset used in [8, 53] did not include all current classes and also for some of the classes, some samples were pruned and added. This set consists of time–frequency images of {LIGO} glitches and their associated metadata. These glitches are organized by time–frequency morphology into 22 classes for which descriptions and representative images are presented. Results from the application of state-of-the-art supervised classification methods to this dataset are presented in order to provide baselines for future glitch classification work. Standard splitting for training, validation, and testing sets are also presented to facilitate the comparison between different machine learning methods. The baseline methods are selected from both traditional and more recent deep learning approaches. An ensemble framework is developed that demonstrates that combining various classifiers can yield a more accurate model for classification. The ensemble classifier, trained with the standard training set, achieves 98.21% accuracy on the standard test set.}

	abstract = {In order to increase the reach of the astrophysical searches, various sources of instrumental and environmental noise must be identified and ameliorated. Here we discuss efforts to understand the origin of noise manifested as short-duration bursts (glitches) and/or range-impacting features at {LIGO} Hanford. Several examples found at {LIGO} Hanford Observatory in O1 and O2 were identified including glitches due to an air compressor, ringing phone, airplanes, and an incorrect servo setting, and a decrease in detector sensitivity due to truck traffic.}

	journal = {Machine Learning: Science and Technology},
	abstract = {Gravitational-wave detectors are exquisitely sensitive instruments and routinely enable ground-breaking observations of novel astronomical phenomena. However, they also witness non-stationary, non-Gaussian noise that can be mistaken for astrophysical sources, lower detection confidence, or simply complicate the extraction of signal parameters from noisy data. To address this, we present iDQ, a supervised learning framework to autonomously detect noise artifacts in gravitational-wave detectors based only on auxiliary degrees of freedom insensitive to gravitational waves. iDQ has operated in low latency throughout the advanced detector era at each of the two {LIGO} interferometers, providing invaluable data quality information about each detection to date in real-time. We document the algorithm, describing the statistical framework and possible applications within gravitational-wave searches. In particular, we construct a likelihood-ratio test that simultaneously accounts for the presence of non-Gaussian noise artifacts and utilizes information from both the observed gravitational-wave strain signal and thousands of auxiliary degrees of freedom. We also present several examples of iDQ’s performance with modern interferometers, showing iDQ’s ability to autonomously reproduce known data quality monitors and identify noise artifacts not flagged by other analyses.}

	abstract = {The characterization of the Advanced {LIGO} detectors in the second and third observing runs has increased the sensitivity of the instruments, allowing for a higher number of detectable gravitational-wave signals, and provided confirmation of all observed gravitational-wave events. In this work, we present the methods used to characterize the {LIGO} detectors and curate the publicly available datasets, including the {LIGO} strain data and data quality products. We describe the essential role of these datasets in {LIGO}–Virgo Collaboration analyses of gravitational-waves from both transient and persistent sources and include details on the provenance of these datasets in order to support analyses of {LIGO} data by the broader community. Finally, we explain anticipated changes in the role of detector characterization and current efforts to prepare for the high rate of gravitational-wave alerts and events in future observing runs.}

	journal = {Classical and Quantum Gravity},
	abstract = {The first observing run of Advanced {LIGO} spanned 4 months, from 12 September 2015 to 19 January 2016, during which gravitational waves were directly detected from two binary black hole systems, namely GW150914 and GW151226. Confident detection of gravitational waves requires an understanding of instrumental transients and artifacts that can reduce the sensitivity of a search. Studies of the quality of the detector data yield insights into the cause of instrumental artifacts and data quality vetoes specific to a search are produced to mitigate the effects of problematic data. In this paper, the systematic removal of noisy data from analysis time is shown to improve the sensitivity of searches for compact binary coalescences. The output of the PyCBC pipeline, which is a python-based code package used to search for gravitational wave signals from compact binary coalescences, is used as a metric for improvement. GW150914 was a loud enough signal that removing noisy data did not improve its significance. However, the removal of data with excess noise decreased the false alarm rate of GW151226 by more than two orders of magnitude, from 1 in 770 yr to less than 1 in 186 000 yr.}

abstract = {We describe the PyCBC search for gravitational waves from compact-object binary coalescences in advanced gravitational-wave detector data. The search was used in the first Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory ({LIGO}) observing run and unambiguously identified two black hole binary mergers, GW150914 and GW151226. At its core, the PyCBC search performs a matched-filter search for binary merger signals using a bank of gravitational-wave template waveforms. We provide a complete description of the search pipeline including the steps used to mitigate the effects of noise transients in the data, identify candidate events and measure their statistical significance. The analysis is able to measure false-alarm rates as low as one per million years, required for confident detection of signals. Using data from initial {LIGO}'s sixth science run, we show that the new analysis reduces the background noise in the search, giving a  increase in sensitive volume for binary neutron star systems over previous searches.}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Letters},
abstract = {The rapid release of accurate sky localization for gravitational-wave (GW) candidates is crucial for multi-messenger observations. During the third observing run of Advanced {LIGO} and Advanced Virgo, automated GW alerts were publicly released within minutes of detection. Subsequent inspection and analysis resulted in the eventual retraction of a fraction of the candidates. Updates could be delayed by up to several days, sometimes issued during or after exhaustive multi-messenger follow-up campaigns. We introduce GWSkyNet, a real-time framework to distinguish between astrophysical events and instrumental artifacts using only publicly available information from the {LIGO}-Virgo open public alerts. This framework consists of a non-sequential convolutional neural network involving sky maps and metadata. GWSkyNet achieves a prediction accuracy of 93.5% on a testing data set.}

title = {{iDQ}: Statistical inference of non-gaussian noise with auxiliary degrees of freedom in gravitational-wave detectors},
journal = {Machine Learning: Science and Technology},
abstract = {Gravitational-wave detectors are exquisitely sensitive instruments and routinely enable ground-breaking observations of novel astronomical phenomena. However, they also witness non-stationary, non-Gaussian noise that can be mistaken for astrophysical sources, lower detection confidence, or simply complicate the extraction of signal parameters from noisy data. To address this, we present iDQ, a supervised learning framework to autonomously detect noise artifacts in gravitational-wave detectors based only on auxiliary degrees of freedom insensitive to gravitational waves. iDQ has operated in low latency throughout the advanced detector era at each of the two {LIGO} interferometers, providing invaluable data quality information about each detection to date in real-time. We document the algorithm, describing the statistical framework and possible applications within gravitational-wave searches. In particular, we construct a likelihood-ratio test that simultaneously accounts for the presence of non-Gaussian noise artifacts and utilizes information from both the observed gravitational-wave strain signal and thousands of auxiliary degrees of freedom. We also present several examples of iDQ’s performance with modern interferometers, showing iDQ’s ability to autonomously reproduce known data quality monitors and identify noise artifacts not flagged by other analyses.}

title = {A Machine Learning-based Source Property Inference for Compact Binary Mergers},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {The detection of the binary neutron star merger, GW170817, was the first success story of multi-messenger observations of compact binary mergers. The inferred merger rate, along with the increased sensitivity of the ground-based gravitational-wave (GW) network in the present {LIGO}/Virgo, and future {LIGO}/Virgo/KAGRA observing runs, strongly hints at detections of binaries that could potentially have an electromagnetic (EM) counterpart. A rapid assessment of properties that could lead to a counterpart is essential to aid time-sensitive follow-up operations, especially robotic telescopes. At minimum, the possibility of counterparts requires a neutron star (NS). Also, the tidal disruption physics is important to determine the remnant matter post-merger, the dynamics of which could result in the counterparts. The main challenge, however, is that the binary system parameters, such as masses and spins estimated from the real-time, GW template-based searches, are often dominated by statistical and systematic errors. Here, we present an approach that uses supervised machine learning to mitigate such selection effects to report the possibility of counterparts based on the presence of an NS component, and the presence of remnant matter post-merger in real time.}
