  "abstract": "The Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors have enabled the confident detection of dozens of mergers of black holes and neutron stars. However, the presence of detector noise transients (glitches) hinders the search for these gravitational wave (GW) signals. We prototyped a restructuring of Gravity Spy's classification model to distinguish between glitches and astrophysical signals. Our method is able to correctly classify three-quarters of retracted candidate events in O3b as non-astrophysical and 100\\% of the confirmed astrophysical events as true signals. This approach will inform candidate event validation efforts in the latest observing run.",
