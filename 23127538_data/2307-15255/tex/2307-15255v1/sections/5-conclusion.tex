\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

A new join optimization, predicate transfer, is proposed in this paper. Inspired by Yannakakis algorithm, predicate transfer generalizes Bloom join to transfer table-local filters to pre-filter multiple other tables. We laid out the design space of predicate transfer and described the heuristics used in our prototype. Evaluation showed an average $3.1\times$ speedup over Bloom join on TPC-H benchmark. 

Predicate transfer opens up substantial research opportunities, including better heuristics in the predicate transfer schedule, deeper theoretical analysis on the performance guarantees, and extending the technique to parallel and distributed environment. Discussions of these topics are left as future work.
