  "abstract": "We report on the temperature dependence of the low-frequency electronic noise in NiO$_x$/Ga$_2$O$_3$ p-n heterojunction diodes. The noise spectral density is of the 1/f-type near room temperature but shows signatures of Lorentzian components at elevated temperatures and at higher current levels (f is the frequency). We observed an intriguing non-monotonic dependence of the noise on temperature near T = 380$^\\circ$ K. The Raman spectroscopy of the device structure suggests material changes, which results in reduced noise above this temperature. The normalized noise spectral density in such diodes was determined to be on the order of 10$^{-14}$ cm$^2$/Hz (f = 10 Hz) at 0.1 A/cm$^2$ current density. In terms of the noise level, NiO$_x$/Ga$_2$O$_3$ p-n diodes occupy an intermediate position among devices of various designs implemented with different ultra-wide-band-gap (UWBG) semiconductors. The obtained results are important for understanding the electronic properties of the UWBG heterojunctions and contribute to the development of noise spectroscopy as the quality assessment tool for new electronic materials and device technologies.",
