\label{sec:setting}

We consider editing of \textit{factual knowledge}, where facts are expressed as triplets $(e, r, o)$ of a subject entity $e$ (e.g. \texttt{Lionel Messi}), a relation $r$ (e.g. \texttt{Team}), and an object $o$ (e.g. \texttt{Inter Miami}).
We distinguish between two edit types, based on the knowledge encoded in the model before the edit: (a) \textit{modification} of a fact that is already encoded in the model $(e, r, o) \rightarrow (e, r, o^*)$, that is, updating the object $o \rightarrow o^*$ for a given subject $e$ and relation $r$, and (b) \textit{injection} of a new fact $(e, r, o^*)$ that is not captured by the model. Moreover, we note that for one-to-one relations like \texttt{Date of birth}, where there is a single object for a given subject, an injection edit can be viewed as populating an empty object $(e, r, \emptyset) \rightarrow (e, r, o^*)$. In contrast, for one-to-many relations, such as \texttt{Sibling} and \texttt{Occupation}, an injection edit augments the set of objects $(e, r, \{o_1,..,o_n\}) \rightarrow (e, r, \{o_1,..,o_n, o^*\})$.
Whether an edit is viewed as a modification or injection, depends on whether that information was captured in the model before the edit. 
Moreover, evaluating if a specific fact (before or after an edit) is encoded by a model is typically done by testing if the model predicts the object for various input queries that represent the subject and relation (see more details in \S\ref{subsec:currentstate}).
