\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we proposed a novel approach to generate affine disjunctive invariants and loop summaries via Farkas' Lemma. 
Experimental results show that our approach is capable of deriving substantially more accurate affine disjunctive invariants and loop summaries against existing approaches. One future direction would be to consider extensions in Remark~\ref{rmk:extension}. Another interesting direction is to extend our approach to procedure summary.
