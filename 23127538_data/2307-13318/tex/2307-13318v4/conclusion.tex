\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we propose a novel approach to generate affine disjunctive invariants over affine loops. Our novelty lies in combining a control flow transformation to extract the interleaving relationships between loop paths and employing Farkas' Lemma to solve the disjunctive invariants of loops. Additionally, we apply invariant propagation techniques to mitigate the computational costs of exponential explosion. A thorough resolution of the infeasible implication in the application of Farkas' Lemma and an extension to nested loops through loop summary are proposed as optimizations for practical program verification.
Experimental results show that our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art software verifiers in affine disjunctive invariant generation over affine loops. 
One future direction would be to consider extensions mentioned in Remark~\ref{rmk:extension}.
