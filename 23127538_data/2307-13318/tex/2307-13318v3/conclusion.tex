\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we have proposed a novel approach to generate affine disjunctive invariants over affine loops via Farkas' Lemma. %We implemented our approach as a prototype tool based on the Clang Static Analyzer. 
We first established the transformation from an affine while loop into an equivalent affine transitions system so that existing aprpoaches in Farkas' Lemma can apply. Then we developed optimizations including invariant propagation to improve time efficiency, the tackling of infeasible implications to improve accuracy and the use of loop summary to extend our approach to nested loops. Experimental results show that our approach is competitive with state-of-the-art software verifiers on affine disjunctive invariant generation over affine loops. 

One future direction would be to consider extensions of our approach to have linear representations to handle properties in machine integers (such as distinguishing the case of integer overflow and different cases of remainder in handling the modulus information) and floating point numbers (see Remark~\ref{rmk:extension}). Another direction is to extend our approach to procedure summary.
