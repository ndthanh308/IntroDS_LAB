  "abstract": "In this study, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical analysis of a Fibonacci quasicrystalline stacking of ferromagnetic layers, potentially realizable using van der Waals magnetic materials. We construct a model of this magnetic heterostructure, which includes up to second neighbor interlayer magnetic interactions, that displays a complex relationship between geometric frustration and magnetic order in this quasicrystalline system. To navigate the parameter space and identify distinct magnetic phases, we employ a machine learning approach, which proves to be a powerful tool in revealing the complex magnetic behavior of this system. We offer a thorough description of the magnetic phase diagram as a function of the model parameters. Notably, we discover among other collinear and non-collinear phases, a unique ferromagnetic alternating helical phase. In this non-collinear quasiperiodic ferromagnetic configuration the magnetization decreases logarithmically with the stack height.",
