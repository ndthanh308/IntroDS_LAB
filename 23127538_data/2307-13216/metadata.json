  "abstract": "Whether SiC$_2$ is a parent species, that is formed in the photosphere or as a by-product of high-temperature dust formation, or a daughter species, formed in a chemistry driven by the photodestruction of parent species in the outer envelope, has been debated for a long time. Here, we analyze the ALMA observations of four SiC$_2$ transitions in the CSEs of three C-rich AGB stars (AI Vol, II Lup, and RAFGL 4211), and found that SiC$_2$ exhibits an annular, shell-like distribution in these targets, suggesting that SiC$_2$ can be a daughter species in the CSEs of carbon-rich AGB stars. The results can provide important references for future chemical models.",
