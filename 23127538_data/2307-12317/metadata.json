  "abstract": "The present study makes use of the adjoint modes of the Linearized Reactive Flow (LRF) equations to investigate the Intrinsic Thermoacoustic (ITA) feedback loop of a laminar premixed slit flame. The analysis shows that the ITA feedback loop is closed by vorticity generated in the boundary layer of the slit by impinging acoustic waves penetrating the slit. In this region, adjoint vorticity shows a high sensitivity of the flow. It is also hypothesised that the ITA eigenmode smoothly transitions to a purely hydrodynamic mode -- vortex shedding -- for a passive flame. The computational domain is chosen sufficiently short so as to isolate the ITA feedback loop from cavity modes. This analysis is made possible by the holistic character of the LRF model, i.e. a direct linearization of the non-linear reactive flow equations, including explicit finite rate chemistry and avoiding idealization of the flow.",
