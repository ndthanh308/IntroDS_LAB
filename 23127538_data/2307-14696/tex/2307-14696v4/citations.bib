  abstract = {Accurately inferring the state of a quantum device from the results of measurements is a crucial task in building quantum information processing hardware. The predominant state estimation procedure, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE), generally reports an estimate with zero eigenvalues. These cannot be justified. Furthermore, the MLE estimate is incompatible with error bars, so conclusions drawn from it are suspect. I propose an alternative procedure, Bayesian mean estimation (BME). BME never yields zero eigenvalues, its eigenvalues provide a bound on their own uncertainties, and under certain circumstances it is provably the most accurate procedure possible. I show how to implement BME numerically, and how to obtain natural error bars that are compatible with the estimate. Finally, I briefly discuss the differences between Bayesian and frequentist estimation techniques.},

But since qubits are noisy and error-prone, they will depend on fault-tolerant quantum error correction (FTQEC) to compute reliably. Quantum error correction can protect against general noise if---and only if---the error in each physical qubit operation is smaller than a certain threshold. The threshold for general errors is quantified by their diamond norm. Until now, qubits have been assessed primarily by randomized benchmarking, which reports a different error rate that is not sensitive to all errors, and cannot be compared directly to diamond norm thresholds. Here we use gate set tomography to completely characterize operations on a trapped-Yb               +               -ion qubit and demonstrate with greater than 95\% confidence that they satisfy a rigorous threshold for FTQEC (diamond norm {$\leq$}6.7 {\texttimes} 10               -4               ).},

  abstract = {Flexible characterization techniques that identify and quantify experimental imperfections under realistic assumptions are crucial for the development of quantum computers. Gate set tomography is a characterization approach that simultaneously and self-consistently extracts a tomographic description of the implementation of an entire set of quantum gates, as well as the initial state and measurement, from experimental data. Obtaining such a detailed picture of the experimental implementation is associated with high requirements on the number of sequences and their design, making gate set tomography a challenging task even for only two qubits. In this work, we show that low-rank approximations of gate sets can be obtained from significantly fewer gate sequences and that it is sufficient to draw them randomly. Such tomographic information is needed for the crucial task of dealing with coherent noise. To this end, we formulate the data processing problem of gate set tomography as a rank-constrained tensor completion problem. We provide an algorithm to solve this problem while respecting the usual positivity and normalization constraints of quantum mechanics by using second-order geometrical optimization methods on the complex Stiefel manifold. Besides the reduction in sequences, we demonstrate numerically that the algorithm does not rely on structured gate sets or an elaborate circuit design to robustly perform gate set tomography. Therefore, it is more flexible than traditional approaches. We also demonstrate how coherent errors in shadow estimation protocols can be mitigated using estimates from gate set tomography.},

  abstract = {Quantum gate set tomography (GST) has emerged as a promising method for the full characterization of quantum logic gates. In contrast to quantum process tomography (QPT), GST self-consistently and correctly accounts for state preparation and measurement (SPAM) errors. It therefore provides significantly more accurate estimates than QPT as gate fidelities increase into the fault-tolerant regime. We give a detailed review of GST and provide a self-contained guide to its implementation. The method is presented in a step-by-step fashion and relevant mathematical background material is included. Our goal is to demonstrate the utility of GST as both an accurate characterization technique and a simple and effective diagnostic tool. As an illustration, we compare the output of GST and QPT using simulated example data for a single qubit. In agreement with the original literature, we find that coherent errors are poorly estimated by QPT near quantum error correction thresholds, while GST is accurate in this regime.},

Our methods have several features that make them amenable to experimental implementation: they require only simple Pauli measurements, use fast convex optimization, are stable against noise, and can be applied to states that are only approximately low-rank. The acquired data can be used to certify that the state is indeed close to pure, so no a priori assumptions are needed. We present both theoretical bounds and numerical simulations.},

  abstract = {The non-Markovianity of quantum dynamics characterizes how a principal system interacts with its environment in an open quantum system. One of the essential characteristics of a Markovian process is that it can be arbitrarily divided into two or more legitimate completely-positive (CP) subprocesses (i.e., the main process has CP-divisibility). However, when at least one non-CP process exists among the divided processes, the dynamics is said to be non-Markovian. Herein, we propose two experimentally feasible methods for identifying non-Markovianity based on CP-divisibility. The first method is based on the non-Markovian process robustness, which proves that non-Markovianity can be treated as a quantum process capability and quantitatively characterizes the ability of a non-CP process to endure a minimum amount of CP operations required to become a CP process, where this non-CP process is determined by quantum process tomography (QPT) and inverse matrix calculation. The second method provides an efficient approach for identifying non-Markovian dynamics by tomographically analyzing a minimum of just two system output states of the dynamical process without the need for QPT. We demonstrate that both methods can be implemented using all-optical setups and can be applied to analyze the non-Markovianity of single-photon and two-photon dynamics in birefringent crystals. They also can be used to explore non-Markovianity and the related effects on quantum-information processing in other dynamical systems where state tomography is implementable.},

  abstract = {Laboratory hardware is rapidly progressing towards a state where quantum error-correcting codes can be realised. As such, we must learn how to deal with the complex nature of the noise that may occur in real physical systems. Single qubit Pauli errors are commonly used to study the behaviour of error-correcting codes, but in general we might expect the environment to introduce correlated errors to a system. Given some knowledge of structures that errors commonly take, it may be possible to adapt the error-correction procedure to compensate for this noise, but performing full state tomography on a physical system to analyse this structure quickly becomes impossible as the size increases beyond a few qubits. Here we develop and test new methods to analyse blue a particular class of spatially correlated errors by making use of parametrised families of decoding algorithms. We demonstrate our method numerically using a diffusive noise model. We show that information can be learnt about the parameters of the noise model, and additionally that the logical error rates can be improved. We conclude by discussing how our method could be utilised in a practical setting blue and propose extensions of our work to study more general error models.},

Early versions of GST emerged around 2012-13, and since then it has been refined, demonstrated, and used in a large number of experiments. This paper presents the foundations of GST in comprehensive detail. The most important feature of GST, compared to older state and process tomography protocols, is that it is calibration-free. GST does not rely on pre-calibrated state preparations and measurements. Instead, it characterizes all the operations in a gate set simultaneously and self-consistently, relative to each other. Long sequence GST can estimate gates with very high precision and efficiency, achieving Heisenberg scaling in regimes of practical interest. In this paper, we cover GST's intellectual history, the techniques and experiments used to achieve its intended purpose, data analysis, gauge freedom and fixing, error bars, and the interpretation of gauge-fixed estimates of gate sets. Our focus is fundamental mathematical aspects of GST, rather than implementation details, but we touch on some of the foundational algorithmic tricks used in the pyGSTi implementation.},

  abstract = {Crosstalk occurs in most quantum computing systems with more than one qubit. It can cause a variety of correlated and nonlocal                                                   crosstalk errors                                               that can be especially harmful to fault-tolerant quantum error correction, which generally relies on errors being local and relatively predictable. Mitigating crosstalk errors requires understanding, modeling, and detecting them. In this paper, we introduce a comprehensive framework for crosstalk errors and a protocol for detecting and localizing them. We give a rigorous definition of crosstalk errors that captures a wide range of disparate physical phenomena that have been called ``crosstalk'', and a concrete model for crosstalk-free quantum processors. Errors that violate this model are crosstalk errors. Next, we give an equivalent but purely operational (model-independent) definition of crosstalk errors. Using this definition, we construct a protocol for detecting a large class of crosstalk errors in a multi-qubit processor by finding conditional dependencies between observed experimental probabilities. It is highly efficient, in the sense that the number of unique experiments required scales at most cubically, and very often quadratically, with the number of qubits. We demonstrate the protocol using simulations of 2-qubit and 6-qubit processors.},

  abstract = {We propose and investigate a new method of quantum process tomography (QPT) which we call projected least squares (PLS). In short, PLS consists of first computing the least-squares estimator of the Choi matrix of an unknown channel, and subsequently projecting it onto the convex set of Choi matrices. We consider four experimental setups including direct QPT with Pauli eigenvectors as input and Pauli measurements, and ancilla-assisted QPT with mutually unbiased bases (MUB) measurements. In each case, we provide a closed form solution for the least-squares estimator of the Choi matrix. We propose a novel, two-step method for projecting these estimators onto the set of matrices representing physical quantum channels, and a fast numerical implementation in the form of the hyperplane intersection projection algorithm. We provide rigorous, non-asymptotic concentration bounds, sampling complexities and confidence regions for the Frobenius and trace-norm error of the estimators. For the Frobenius error, the bounds are linear in the rank of the Choi matrix, and for low ranks, they improve the error rates of the least squares estimator by a factor \$d\^{}2\$, where \$d\$ is the system dimension. We illustrate the method with numerical experiments involving channels on systems with up to 7 qubits, and find that PLS has highly competitive accuracy and computational tractability.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            In the scale-up of quantum computers, the framework underpinning fault-tolerance generally relies on the strong assumption that environmental noise affecting qubit logic is uncorrelated (Markovian). However, as physical devices progress well into the complex multi-qubit regime, attention is turning to understanding the appearance and mitigation of correlated --- or non-Markovian --- noise, which poses a serious challenge to the progression of quantum technology. This error type has previously remained elusive to characterisation techniques. Here, we develop a framework for characterising non-Markovian dynamics in quantum systems and experimentally test it on multi-qubit superconducting quantum devices. Where noisy processes cannot be accounted for using standard Markovian techniques, our reconstruction predicts the behaviour of the devices with an infidelity of 10               -3               . Our results show this characterisation technique leads to superior quantum control and extension of coherence time by effective decoupling from the non-Markovian environment. This framework, validated by our results, is applicable to any controlled quantum device and offers a significant step towards optimal device operation and noise reduction.},

Identifying parameters such as gate and readout error rates is critical to these models. We use a Bayesian inference approach to identify posterior distributions of these parameters such that they can be characterized more elaborately. By characterizing the device errors in this way, we can further improve the accuracy of quantum error mitigation. Experiments conducted on IBM's quantum computing devices suggest that our approach provides better error mitigation performance than existing techniques used by the vendor. Also, our approach outperforms the standard Bayesian inference method in some scenarios.},
