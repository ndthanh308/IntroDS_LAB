	abstract = "In an earlier paper (1999, Electron. J. Combin.6, R37), the author generalized Ehrhart's idea of counting lattice points in dilated rational polytopes: Given a rational polytope, that is, a polytope with rational vertices, we use its description as the intersection of halfspaces, which determine the facets of the polytope. Instead of just a single dilation factor, we allow different dilation factors for each of these facets. We proved that, if our polytope is a simplex, the lattice point counts in the interior and closure of such a vector-dilated simplex are quasipolynomials satisfying an Ehrhart-type reciprocity law. This generalizes the classical reciprocity law for rational polytopes. In the present paper we complete the picture by extending this result to general rational polytopes. As a corollary, we also generalize a reciprocity theorem of Stanley."

	abstract = "This paper discusses algorithms and software for the enumeration of all lattice points inside a rational convex polytope: we describe LattE, a computer package for lattice point enumeration which contains the first implementation of A. Barvinok?s algorithm (Math. Oper. Res. 19 (1994) 769). We report on computational experiments with multiway contingency tables, knapsack type problems, rational polygons, and flow polytopes. We prove that these kinds of symbolic?algebraic ideas surpass the traditional branch-and-bound enumeration and in some instances LattE is the only software capable of counting. Using LattE, we have also computed new formulas of Ehrhart (quasi-)polynomials for interesting families of polytopes (hypersimplices, truncated cubes, etc). We end with a survey of other ?algebraic?analytic? algorithms, including a ?homogeneous? variation of Barvinok?s algorithm which is very fast when the number of facet-defining inequalities is much smaller compared to the number of vertices."

In this work we study the quasipolynomial nature of the Kronecker function using elementary tools from polyhedral geometry. We write the Kronecker function in terms of coefficients of a vector partition function. This allows us to define a new family of coefficients, the atomic Kronecker coefficients. Our derivation is explicit and self-contained, and gives a new exact formula and an upper bound for the Kronecker coefficients in the first nontrivial case.}
