  "abstract": "The vector partition function $p_A$ associated to a $d \\times n$ matrix $A$ with integer entries is the function $\\mathbb{Z}^d \\to \\mathbb{N}$ defined by $\\mathbf{b} \\to \\#\\{\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{N}^n : A\\mathbf{x} = \\mathbf{b}\\}$. It is known that vector partition functions are piecewise quasi-polynomials whose domains of quasi-polynomiality are maximal cones (chambers) of a fan called the chamber complex of $A$.\n  In this article we introduce \\emph{external columns} and \\emph{external chambers} of vector partition functions. Our main result is that (up to a saturation condition) the quasi-polynomial associated to a chamber containing external columns arises from a vector partition function with $k$ fewer equations and variables. In the case that the chamber is external -- that is, when the number of external columns in a chamber is as large as possible without being trivial -- the quasi-polynomial arises from a coin exchange problem. By exploiting this we are able to obtain a determinantal formula, characterize when the quasi-polynomial is polynomial, and show that in this case it is actually given by a negative binomial coefficient. We then apply these results to the enumeration of loopless multigraphs satisfying some degree conditions. Finally, we suggest a generalization to a result of Baldoni and Vergne for polynomials arising from chambers that we call \\emph{semi-external chambers}.",
