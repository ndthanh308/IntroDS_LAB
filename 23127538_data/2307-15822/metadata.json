  "abstract": "We develop lower bounds for the energy of configurations in $\\mathbb{R}^d$ periodic with respect to a lattice. In certain cases, the construction of sharp bounds can be formulated as a finite dimensional, multivariate polynomial interpolation problem. We use this framework to show a scaling of the equitriangular lattice $A_2$ is universally optimal among all configurations of the form $ω_4+ A_2$ where $ω_4$ is a 4-point configuration in $\\mathbb{R}^2$. Likewise, we show a scaling and rotation of $A_2$ is universally optimal among all configurations of the form $ω_6+L$ where $ω_6$ is a 6-point configuration in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ and $L=\\mathbb{Z} \\times \\sqrt{3} \\mathbb{Z}$.",
