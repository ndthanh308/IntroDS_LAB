\begin{abstract}
We develop lower bounds for the energy of configurations in $\R^d$     periodic with respect to a lattice. 
In certain cases, the construction of sharp bounds can be formulated as a finite dimensional, multivariate polynomial interpolation problem. We use this framework to show a scaling of the equitriangular lattice $A_2$ is universally optimal among all configurations of the form $\omega_4+ A_2$ where $\omega_4$ is a 4-point configuration in $\R^2$. Likewise, we show a scaling and rotation of $A_2$ is universally optimal among all configurations of the form $\omega_6+L$ where $\omega_6$ is a 6-point configuration in $\R^2$ and $L=\Z \times \sqrt{3} \Z$.

% Introduction and Overview



 
\section{Introduction and Overview of Results}
Let  $\Lambda$ be a lattice in $\R^d$ (see subsection~\ref{lattbasics} for more about lattices) and let   $F:\R^d  \rightarrow (-\infty,\infty]$ be   lower-semicontinuous and $\Lambda$-periodic (i.e., $F(\cdot+v)=F$ for all $v\in \Lambda$). We refer to $\Lambda$ as the \textit{periodization lattice} and $F$ as the \textit{periodization kernel}. For a finite multiset $\omega_n=\{x_1,...,x_n\}\subseteq \R^d$ of cardinality $n$, we consider the \textit{$F$-energy} of $\omega_n$ defined by
\[
E_F(\omega_n):=\sum_{i=1}^n\sum_{\substack{j=1\\ j\neq i}}^n F(x_i-x_j).
\]
 Without loss of generality, we may assume that $\omega_n$ lies in some specified fundamental domain $\Omega_\Lambda:=\R^d/\Lambda$ since   replacing a point $x\in\omega_n$ with any point in $x+\Lambda$ does not change $E_F(\omega_n)$.
\\


The \textit{minimal discrete $n$-point $F$-energy} is    defined as
\begin{equation}\label{minEndef}
\mathcal{E}_F(n):= \inf \{E_F(\omega_n)\mid  \omega_n \subseteq \R^d, \, \lvert \omega_n\rvert=n\},
\end{equation}
where $\lvert \omega\rvert$ denotes the cardinality of a multiset $\omega$.    
An $n$-point configuration $\omega_n\subset \R^d$  satisfying $E_F(\omega_n)=\mathcal{E}_F(n)$ is called \textit{$F$-optimal}. Note that the lower-semicontinuity of $F$ and the compactness of $\Omega_\Lambda$ in the torus topology implies the existence of at least one $F$-optimal configuration. 



More specifically, we consider periodic potentials generated by  a function  $f: [0,\infty)\to [0,\infty]$ with $d$-rapid decay (i.e. $f(r^2) \in \mathcal{O}(r^{-s} ),  r \rightarrow \infty$, for some $s>d$) using 
\begin{equation}\label{Ffdef}
F_{f,\Lambda}(x):=\sum_{v\in \Lambda}f(|x+v|^2).
\end{equation}
The potential $F_{f,\Lambda}$ has the following  physical interpretation: if $f(r^2)$ represents the energy required to place a pair of unit charge particles a distance $r$ from each other, then $F_{f,\Lambda}(x)$ is the energy required to place such a particle at the point $x$ in the presence of existing particles at points of $\Lambda$.    We write the pair interaction in terms of the distance squared since it will be more compatible with the notion  of {\em universal optimality} described below. \\

 
The periodization of Gaussian potentials $f_a(r^2):=\exp(-ar^2)$ for $a>0$ leads to a type of lattice theta function (cf. \cite[Chapter 10]{MEbook}) and plays a central role in our analysis.  For convenience,  we write   $F_{a,\Lambda}:= F_{f_a,\Lambda}$ or just $F_a$ when the choice of lattice is unambiguous.  
\begin{definition}\label{UniOptDef} Let $\Lambda$ be a lattice in $\R^d$. \begin{itemize}
    \item 
We say that an $n$-point configuration $\omega_n\subset \R^d$ is \textit{$\Lambda$-universally optimal} if it is $F_{a,\Lambda}$-optimal for all $a>0$ (cf.,   \cite{Cohn_Kumar_2007}).

\item We say  $\Lambda$ is \textit{universally optimal} if for any sublattice 
$\Phi\subseteq \Lambda$ of index $n$, the $n$-point configuration $\Lambda\cap \Omega_\Phi$ is $\Phi$-universally optimal.
\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
If $\omega_n$ is $\Lambda$-universally optimal, then it follows from  a theorem of Bernstein \cite{Bernstein_1929} (see \cite{Cohn_Kumar_2007},\cite{MEbook}) that $\omega_n$ is $F_{f,\Lambda}$-optimal for any $f$ with $d$-rapid decay  that is  completely monotone on $(0,\infty)$.\footnote{Recall that a function $g$ is completely monotone on an interval $I$ if $(-1)^ng^{(n)}\geq 0$ on $I$ for all positive integers $n$.}



 As we discuss in the Appendix, it follows from classical results of  \cite{Fisher_1964}  that a lattice is universally optimal in the sense of Definition~\ref{UniOptDef} if and only if it is  universally optimal in the more general sense of  \cite{Cohn_Kumar_2007} or \cite{CKMRV_2022}, which we describe at the end of the section. 
 

 
 
 We further show that to establish the universal optimality of $\Lambda$, it is sufficient to prove that there is some sublattice $\Phi\subseteq \Lambda$ such that $\Lambda\cap \Omega_{m\Phi}$ is $m\Phi$-universally optimal for infinitely many $m\in \N$.  
 Observing that the notion of lattice universal optimality in Definition~\ref{UniOptDef} is invariant under linear similitudes, we find it convenient to consider the $\Phi$-universal optimality of configurations of the form \begin{equation}\label{genConfig}
 \omega(\Phi,\Lambda,m)= \left(\frac{1}{m}\Lambda\right)\cap\Omega_\Phi
 \end{equation}
 for a  sublattice $\Phi$ of a lattice $\Lambda$.
\\


It was shown in \cite{Cohn_Kumar_2007} that $\mathbb{Z}$ is universally optimal in $\R$ (see \cite{Su_2015} for a simple, alternate proof). Recently it was shown in \cite{CKMRV_2022} that the $E_8$ and Leech lattices are universally optimal in dimensions 8 and 24, respectively. 
It was further conjectured that the hexagonal $A_2$ lattice
\[
A_2:=\begin{bmatrix}
   1& 1/2\\
  0& \sqrt{3}/2
    \end{bmatrix}\mathbb{Z}^2,
    %=\begin{bmatrix} u_0 & u_1\end{bmatrix}\mathbb{Z}^2.
\] 
%with   fundamental domain $\Omega_0$ generated by  $u_0:=[1,0]^T, u_1:=[1/2, \sqrt{3}/2]^T$.
 is universally optimal in $\R^2$. Though $A_2$ has long been known to be optimal for circle packing (see \cite{Toth_1940}) and was proved to be universally optimal among lattices in \cite{Montgomery_88}, surprisingly, its conjectured universal optimality among all infinite configurations (of fixed density) remains open.
 
 The  proofs of universal optimality for $\Z$, $E_8$, and the Leech lattice given in  \cite{Cohn_Kumar_2007} and \cite{CKMRV_2022} are based on so-called ``linear programming bounds" originally developed in the context of coding theory for point configurations on the $d$-dimensional sphere 
(e.g., see \cite{DGS}, \cite{Levenshtein}, \cite{Yudin_92}) 
 and extended to bounds for the energy and sphere-packing density of point configurations in $\R^d$ in (e.g., see \cite{Cohn_2003}, \cite{Cohn_Kumar_2007}, and \cite{CKMRV_2022}). 
 In fact, these linear programming bounds for point configurations in $\R^d$ are first proved for general periodic configurations, which we adapt for a fixed periodization lattice $\Lambda$ in Proposition~\ref{linearprogramming}.\\


In Section~\ref{sec2},  we formulate linear programming bounds for lattice periodic configurations in $\R^d$ and find sufficient conditions on the periodization lattice to permit a certain polynomial structure (see Proposition~\ref{polystruct}).   Furthermore, we develop conditions for the $F$-optimality of  configurations of the form \eqref{genConfig} in terms of polynomial interpolation.    


We apply this framework  to the following four families of configurations (arising from scalings of $A_2$) using the notation of \eqref{genConfig}. 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item[(a)] $\Phi=A_2$ and $$\omega^*_{m^2}:=\omega(\Phi,A_2,m),$$ conjectured to be $A_2$-universally optimal.
    \item[(b)]  $\Phi=L$ and $$\omega^*_{2m^2}:=\omega(\Phi,A_2,m),$$ conjectured to be $L$-universally optimal.
     \item[(c)] $\Phi= \sqrt{3}R_{\pi/6}A_2$ (where $R_{\pi/6}$ denotes the $\pi/6$ rotation matrix) and    $$\omega^*_{3m^2}:=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}R_{-\pi/6}\omega(\Phi,A_2,m),$$ conjectured to be $A_2$-universally optimal (note $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}R_{-\pi/6}\Phi=A_2$).    
     \item[(d)] $\Phi= \sqrt{3}R_{\pi/6}L$ and   $$\omega^*_{6m^2}:=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}R_{-\pi/6}\omega(\Phi,A_2,m),$$ conjectured to be $L$-universally optimal (note $\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}R_{-\pi/6}\Phi=L$).
\end{enumerate}

The universal optimality of the configurations $\omega_{\kappa m^2}^*$ for $\kappa \in \{1,2,3,6\}$ is an immediate consequence of the conjectured universal optimality of $A_2$ should this be true.   Conversely, as discussed above, the universal optimality of $A_2$ would follow if analogous results are established for any of the four families $\omega^*_{m^2},\omega^*_{2m^2},\omega^*_{3m^2},\omega^*_{6m^2}$ for infinitely many $m\in \mathbb{N}$.\\

The proofs of universal optimality of two of the base cases, $\omega_2^*$ and $\omega_3^*$, follow immediately from results on theta functions, some classical and some from \cite{Baernstein_1997} (cf. \cite{Su_2015} or \cite{Faulhuber_2023} for proofs in the context of periodic energy). Our main results are proofs, utilizing the linear programming bounds, of the universal optimality of the next two base cases, $\omega_4^*$ and $\omega_6^*$:

\begin{theorem}\label{mainThm}
The configurations $\omega_{4}^*$ and $\omega_{6}^*$ are $A_2$ and $L$-universally optimal, respectively.
\end{theorem}
  
% Figure environment removed
%$A_2$ decomposes as $L \sqcup ([1/2,\sqrt{3}/2]^T +L)$. Let $\Omega_L$ be the fundamental region of $L$ generated by $u_0$ and $\ell_1=[0,\sqrt{3}]^T$. 


We can rephrase Theorem \ref{mainThm} in terms of the energies of infinite configurations, for which we follow the notation of  \cite{CKMRV_2022}.
Let $B(x,r)$ be the ball of radius $r>0$ centered at $x$. If $C$ is an infinite, multiset in $\R^d$ such that every ball intersects finitely many points, we call it an \textit{infinite configuration}. Define $C_r:C \cap B(0,r) $ and  the \textit{density of $C$} as
\[
\lim_{r\rightarrow \infty} \frac{\vert C_r \vert}{{\rm Vol}(B(0,r))},
\]
assuming the limit exists and is finite. Similarly to above, for a lower semi-continuous map $f:[0,\infty)\rightarrow [0,\infty]$ of $d$-rapid decay, we define the $f$-energy of an $n$-point configuration $\omega_n=\{ x_1,\dots,x_n\}\subseteq \R^d$ as 
\[
E_f(\omega_n):=\sum_{\substack{1\leq i,j\leq n \\ i\neq j}}f(\vert x_i-x_j\vert^2).
\]
and the infimum over all $n$-point configurations contained in some set $X$ as $\mathcal{E}_f(n,X)$, where we extend the definition to $n\not \in \N$ via linear interpolation. 
Then for a configuration $C$ of density $\rho$, the \textit{lower $f$-energy of $C$} is 
\[
E^{l}_f(C):=\liminf_{r\rightarrow \infty} \frac{E_f(C_r)}{\vert C_r\vert}.
\] 
If the limit exists, we'll write it as $E_f(C)$ and call it the \textit{$f$-energy of $C$}. A configuration $C'$ of density $\rho$ is \textit{universally optimal} if its $f$-energy exists and satisfies
\[
E_{f}(C') \leq E^{l}_{f}(C)
\] 
for every other infinite configuration $C$ of density $\rho$ and $f: x\rightarrow e^{-ax^2}$.
Similarly, a configuration $C'$ is universally optimal among $S$ if we further restrict $C$ to elements of $S$. 
We'll also say an infinite configuration $C$ is an \textit{$N$-point $\Lambda$-periodic configuration} if 
\[
C=\cup_{i=1}^{N} x_i+ \Lambda
\]
for some set of \textit{representatives} $\omega_N^C=\{x_1,\dots,x_n\}$. 
Then we have the following connection between the $f$-energy of $C$, and the $F_{f,\Lambda}$ energy of $\omega_N^C$ (cf.    \cite[Lemma 9.1]{Cohn_Kumar_2007} or \cite[Chapter 10]{MEbook}). 
\begin{proposition}
\label{periodictoaverage}
Let $C$ be an $N$-point $\Lambda$-periodic configuration with $\omega_N^C$ a set of representatives, and $f:x^2\rightarrow e^{-ax^2}$ for some $a>0$. Recall $F_{a,\Lambda}$ is the $\Lambda$-periodization of $f$. Then $E_f(C)$ exists and 
\[
E_f(C)= \frac{1}{N}\left(E_{F,\Lambda} (\omega_{N}^{X})+ N\sum_{0\neq v\in \Lambda} f(v)\right).
\]
\end{proposition}
Thus, Theorem \ref{mainThm} can be restated as follows: $A_2/2$ is universally optimal among all 4-point $A_2$-periodic configurations, and a rotation and scaling of $A_2$ is universal among all 6-point $L$-periodic configurations.

%Finally, we present numerical evidence for a proposed interpolant that would verify the $L$-universal optimality of $\omega_8$. 
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


%The optimality of these 4 and 6-point configurations extend existing results on the optimality of 2 and 3-point configurations arising from $A_2$, pictured below  (cf. \cite{Baernstein_1997} for the key result on the minimum of $F_{A_2,a}$ and \cite{Su_2015} for a proof in the context of periodic energy). The 3-point configuration can be obtained by intersecting $A_2$ with a fundamental domain of the sublattice $\sqrt{3}R_{\pi/6}A_2$. Similarly, an optimal 2-point configuration can be obtained by removing any     point from the optimal 3-point configuration.  
%$A_2$ decomposes as $L \sqcup ([1/2,\sqrt{3}/2]^T +L)$. Let $\Omega_L$ be the fundamental region of $L$ generated by $u_0$ and $\ell_1=[0,\sqrt{3}]^T$. Then Let $C$ be an $A_2$-invariant set. If $\lvert C \cap \Omega^*\rvert=n$, then $\lvert C\cap \Omega_l\rvert=2n$ and we have the following correspondence:
%\begin{observation}
%If $C$ is $A_2$ periodic and $2n$-point $L$ optimal, in the sense of minimizing energy on $\Omega_L$ for $F$, the $L$-periodization of some function $f$, then $C$ is also $n$-point $A_2$ optimal in that it minimizes energy on $\Omega^*$ for the $A_2$-periodization of $f$. The converse fails to hold.
%\end{observation}

\section{Lattices and Linear Programming Bounds for Periodic Energy \label{sec2}} 
\subsection{Preliminaries: Lattices and Fourier Series}
\label{lattbasics}
We first gather some basic definitions and properties of lattices in $\R^d$. 
\begin{definition}
Let  $\Lambda\subset \R^d$.
  \begin{itemize} 
  \item  $\Lambda$ is a {\em lattice in $\R^d$}  if 
   $\Lambda:= V \mathbb{Z}^d=\left\{\sum_{i=1}^da_iv_i\mid a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_d\in \mathbb{Z}\right\}$ for some nonsingular $d\times d$ matrix $V$  with columns $v_1, \ldots v_d$. We refer to $V$ as a {\em generator} for $\Lambda$.   
   \item Once a choice of generator $V$ is specified, we let  $\Omega_\Lambda:=V\mathbb[0,1)^d$  denote the parallelepiped {\em fundamental domain} for $\Lambda$. The {\em co-volume of $\Lambda$} defined by $\left|\Lambda\right|:=|\det V|$ is the volume  of $\Omega_\Lambda$  which is, in fact, the same for any  Lebesgue measurable fundamental domain\footnote{A {\em fundamental domain} for a group $G$ acting on a set $X$  is a subset of $X$ consisting of exactly one point from each $G$-orbit. Note that $X/G$ will be used to denote both a fundamental domain and the set of $G$ orbits in $X$.} for $\R^d/\Lambda$ where $\Lambda$ acts on $\R^d$ by translation.
   \item The {\em dual lattice} $\Lambda^*$ of a lattice $\Lambda$ with generator $V$ is the lattice generated by $V^{-T}=(V^T)^{-1}$ or, equivalently,
   $\Lambda^*:=\{v\in \R^d\mid w\cdot v\in \mathbb{Z} \text{ for all } w\in \Lambda    \}.$
   \item We denote by $S_\Lambda$ the {\em symmetry group of $\Lambda$} consisting of isometries on $\R^d$ fixing $\Lambda$  and   denote by $G_\Lambda$ the subgroup of $S_\Lambda$ fixing the origin (and thus can be considered as elements of the orthogonal group $O(d)$).     Note that $G_\Lambda=S_\Lambda/\Lambda$ where we identify $v\in\Lambda$ with  the translation $\cdot+v$.   Further, note that $G_{\Lambda^*}=G_{\Lambda}$  since elements of $O(d)$ preserve inner products. 
   \end{itemize}
\end{definition} 

 Let $\Lambda$ be a lattice in $\R^d$ with generator $V$  and fundamental domain $\Omega_\Lambda$.  We
 let $L^2(\Omega_\Lambda)$ denote the Hilbert space of complex-valued $\Lambda$-periodic functions on $\R^d$ with  inner product $\langle f,g\rangle=\int_{\Omega_\Lambda}f(x)\overline{g(x)}\, dx$. Then $\{e^{2\pi i v\cdot x}\mid v\in \Lambda^*\}$ 
forms an orthogonal basis of $L^2(\Omega_\Lambda)$ yielding the Fourier  expansion of a function $g\in L^2(\Omega_\Lambda)$:
\begin{equation}
    \label{FExp}
g(x)=\sum_{v\in \Lambda^*} \hat{g}_v e^{2\pi i v\cdot x}
\end{equation}
with Fourier coefficients   $\hat{g}_v:=\frac{1}{|\Lambda|}\int_{\Omega_\Lambda} g(x)$ for $v\in \Lambda^*$
where equality (and the implied unconditional limit on the right hand side) holds in $L^2(\Omega_\Lambda)$.  Of course, elements of $L^2(\Omega_\Lambda)$ are actually equivalence classes of functions.  If $g\in L^2(\Omega_\Lambda)$ contains an element of $C(\R^d)$, then we identify $g$ with its continuous representative and write $g\in L^2(\Omega_\Lambda)\cap C(\R^d)$.  
As will be the case in our applications, if $g\in L^2(\Omega_\Lambda)$ is such that $\sum_{v\in \Lambda^*}|\hat{g}_v|<\infty$, then the right-hand side of \eqref{FExp} converges uniformly and unconditionally to $g$ and so $g\in L^2(\Omega_\Lambda)\cap C(\R^d)$ and \eqref{FExp}   holds pointwise for every $x\in \R^d$. 

\subsection{Lattice symmetry, symmetrized basis functions, and polynomial structure}
\label{latticesymmetry}
Let $\Lambda$ be a lattice in $\R^d$, $f:\R^d\to\R$ have rapid $d$-decay, and  $\sigma\in G_\Lambda$. Since  $\sigma^{-1}\in G_\Lambda$ and $\sigma$ is an isometry, we have  
$$
F_{f,\Lambda}(\sigma x) =\sum_{v\in \sigma^{-1}\Lambda} f(\lvert \sigma x + \sigma v\rvert^2)
 =\sum_{v\in \Lambda} f(\lvert x + v\rvert^2) 
 =F_{f,\Lambda}(x).
$$  Then
$F_{f,\Lambda}$ is also $\Lambda$-periodic and we obtain: 
\begin{proposition}
\label{G2invariance}
Suppose $f:[0,\infty)\to[0,\infty]$ has $d$-rapid decay and  $\Lambda$ is a lattice in $\R^d$. Then for all $\sigma\in G_\Lambda$, $v\in\Lambda$ and $x\in \R^2$, we have $F_{f,\Lambda}(\sigma x+v)=F_{f,\Lambda}(x)$ showing that $F_{f,\Lambda}$ is $S_\Lambda$-invariant.   
\end{proposition}

 
 


We next recall that   $g \in L^2(\Omega_\Lambda)$ is $\sigma$-invariant for $\sigma\in G_\Lambda$ if and only if the Fourier coefficients of $g$ are $\sigma$-invariant, as described in the next proposition. 

\begin{proposition}
\label{groupCfs}
Suppose  $g \in L^2(\Omega_\Lambda)$ and $\sigma\in G_\Lambda$.  Then $g(\sigma x)=g(x)$ for a.e. $x\in\R^d$
  if and only if $\hat{g}_{\sigma v}=\hat{g}_{v}$ for all $v\in \Lambda^*$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Since $\sigma^{-1}\in G_{\Lambda^*}=G_\Lambda$, we have
$$g(\sigma x)=\sum_{v\in \Lambda^*} \hat{g}_{v} e^{2\pi i v\cdot (\sigma x)}=\sum_{v\in \sigma^{-1}\Lambda^*} \hat{g}_v e^{2\pi i (\sigma v)\cdot (\sigma x)}=\sum_{v\in \Lambda^*} \hat{g}_{\sigma v} e^{2\pi i v\cdot x}.$$ The proposition then follows from uniqueness properties of the Fourier expansion.
\end{proof}

Let  $\Gamma$ be a subgroup of  $ G_\Lambda$.  
For $v\in \Lambda^*$,
let $\CC_v^\Gamma$ be the $\Lambda$-periodic function defined by 
\begin{equation}\label{CCdef}
 \CC_v^{\Gamma}(x) :=
    \frac{1}{|\Gamma|}
    \sum_{\sigma\in \Gamma}
    e^{2\pi i (\sigma v)\cdot x}=
    \frac{1}{|\Gamma(v)|}
    \sum_{v'\in \Gamma(v)}
    e^{2\pi i   v'\cdot x}, 
    \quad x\in \R^d.
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma(v)$ denotes the  orbit $\Gamma(v)=\{\sigma v \mid \sigma\in \Gamma\}.$    We write $\CC_v$ for $\CC_v^\Gamma$ when $\Gamma$ is unambiguous.    
%Since clearly $\CC_{\sigma v}=\CC_{v}$ by definition, we will typically restrict our consideration of $v\in \Phi^*$ to fundamental domains of $\Phi^*$ mod the action of  $G_\Phi$, denoted $\Phi^*/ G$.
If $g\in L^2(\Omega_\Lambda)$ and $g$
is $G_\Lambda$-invariant (i.e., if $g(\sigma \cdot)=g$ for all $\sigma\in G_\Lambda$), then we may rewrite \eqref{FExp} as
\begin{equation}
    \label{FExpG}
g(x)=\sum_{v\in \Lambda^*/\Gamma} |\Gamma(v)| \,\hat{g}_v \,\CC_v^\Gamma(x).
\end{equation}

 %Let $\id$ denote the identity function on $\R^d$ and $\Gamma=\{\id, -\id\}$.   Then for $v\in \R^d$, $$\CC^\Gamma_v(x)=\cos(2\pi v\cdot x). $$

  We next consider the case of a {\em rectangular lattice} by which we mean a lattice of the form $\Lambda_R=(a_1\Z)\times \cdots (a_d\Z)$ with $a_1,\ldots,a_d>0$.  The symmetry group of a rectangular lattice in $\R^d$
  contains the subgroup $H$ of order $2^d$ generated by the coordinate reflections \begin{equation}
  \label{Rjdef}    
  R_j(x_1,\dots,x_j,\ldots,x_d)=(x_1,\dots,-x_j,\ldots,x_d),\qquad j=1,2,\ldots, d.
  \end{equation}
  Let   $v\in \Lambda^*=(1/a_1)\Z\times \cdots (1/a_d)\Z$, and note that $v=(k_1/a_1,k_2/a_2,\dots,k_d/a_d)$ for some $k_1,\dots,k_d \in \Z$.  A straightforward induction on $d$ gives  
        \begin{equation}
    \CC_v^{H}(x)=  \prod_{i=1}^{d} \cos(2\pi k_i x_i /a_i))
   = \prod_{i=1}^{d} T_{\vert k_i \vert}(\cos(2\pi x_i /a_i)).
  \end{equation}
Recall   the $\ell$th Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind defined by $\cos(\ell t)=T_\ell(\cos t)$ for $\ell=0,1,2,\ldots$.  We then have  the following proposition.
\begin{proposition}\label{rectvars}
Let $\Lambda_R=(a_1\Z)\times \cdots (a_d\Z)$ with $a_1,\ldots,a_d>0$.  If $v\in \Lambda_R^*$, then
$v=(k_1/a_1,k_2/a_2,\dots,k_d/a_d)$ for some $k_1,\dots,k_d \in \Z$ and
    \begin{equation}    \CC_v^{H}(x)
 = \prod_{i=1}^{d} T_{\vert k_i \vert}(t_i),
  \end{equation}
where $t_i=\cos(2\pi x_i /a_i)\in [-1,1]$ for $i=1,2,\ldots,d$. 
\end{proposition}

We next deduce a polynomial structure for $\CC_v^{\Lambda}$  for lattices $\Lambda$ that are invariant under the  coordinate reflections $R_j$; i.e., such that $H\subseteq G_\Lambda$.


\begin{proposition}
\label{polystruct}
Let $\Lambda\subseteq \R^d$ be a lattice such that $H\subseteq G_\Lambda$.  Then $\Lambda$ contains a rectangular lattice $\Lambda_R= (a_1\Z)\times \cdots \times (a_d\Z)$ and  
the function $\CC^{G_\Lambda}_{v}(x)$ is a polynomial in the  variables $t_j=\cos(2\pi x_j/a_j)$ for $j=1,2,\ldots,d$ and any $v\in \Lambda^*$. 
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
We first show that $\Lambda$ must contain some rectangular  sublattice (i.e., of the form $\Lambda_R=(a_1\Z)\times \cdots \times(a_d\Z)$).  Since $\Lambda$ is full-rank, for each   $j=1,2,\ldots,d$, there is some $w^j\in\Lambda$ such that $a_j:=2w^j\cdot e^j\neq 0$ where $e^j$ denotes the  $j$-th  coordinate unit vector.   Then $a_je^j=w^j-R_jw^j\in \Lambda$,
and so the rectangular lattice $(a_1\Z)\times \cdots \times(a_d\Z)$ is a sublattice of $\Lambda$. 

    Let $v\in \Lambda^*$. Since $\Lambda_R \subseteq \Lambda$, $\Lambda^*\subseteq \Lambda_R^*$, so $v\in \Lambda_R^*$. Let $C=\{\sigma_1,\dots,\sigma_{[G_\lambda:H]}\}$ be a set of right coset representatives of $H$ in $G_\Lambda$, so that $\vert C\vert \vert H\vert=\vert G\vert$.
    Then we have 
   \begin{equation}
       \begin{split}
        \CC^{G_\Lambda}_{v}&=\frac{1}{\vert G_\Lambda \vert}\sum_{g\in G_\Lambda}e^{2\pi i gv\cdot x}\\
        &= \frac{1}{\vert C\vert } \sum_{\sigma \in C} \frac{1}{\vert H \vert}\sum_{h\in H} e^{2\pi i h\sigma v\cdot x } \\
        &= \frac{1}{\vert C\vert } \sum_{\sigma \in C} \CC^H_{\sigma v}.
    \end{split}
    \end{equation} 
 Proposition~\ref{rectvars} implies  $\CC^H_{\sigma v}$ is polynomial in the variables $t_j=\cos(2\pi x_j/a_j)$ and thus  so is $\CC^{G_\Lambda}_{v}$.     
\end{proof}
Proposition \ref{polystruct} motivates the change of variables 
\begin{equation}
\label{littlettransformation}
t_i := \cos(2\pi x_i/a_i), \qquad i=1,...,d. 
\end{equation}
We then let $T_{a_1,...,a_d}: \R^d \rightarrow \R^d$ be defined by 
\begin{equation}
\label{Ttransformation}
T_{a_1,\dots,a_d}(x_1,...,x_d):=(t_1,\dots,t_d).
\end{equation}

For any function $h$ defined on a subset of $X\subseteq[0,a_1/2]\times \cdots [0,a_d/2]$, $\tilde{h}$ will refer to the function defined on $\tilde{X}\subseteq[-1,1]^d$ by the formula
\[
\tilde{h}(t)=h\left(\frac{a_1 \arccos t_1}{2\pi},\dots,\frac{a_d\arccos t_2}{2\pi}\right),
\]
which ensures $\tilde{h}(t)=h(x)$.

It follows by Proposition \ref{polystruct} that the maps \begin{equation}\label{tildeP}P^{\Phi}_v:=\tilde{\CC}^{G_\Phi}_{v}, \qquad v\in \Phi^*,\end{equation}  are polynomials in the variables $t_i,\dots, t_d$.
We shall also write $P_v$ when the choice of $\Phi$ is clear. Similarly,
the $T_{a_1,\dots,a_d}$ image of any subset $D\subseteq [0,1/2]\times [0,\sqrt{3}/2]$ will be denoted $\tilde{D}$. In any case where we do so, the choice of rectangular lattice (and hence the choice of $a_i$'s will be clear).\\

We also remark that the collection of polynomials $\{P_v^{G_\Phi} \mid v\in \Phi^*/G_\Phi\}$ is orthogonal with respect to the measure $(1-t_1^2)^{-1/2}\cdots (1-t_d^2)^{-1/2}dt_1\, \cdots\, dt_d$ on $[-1,1]^d$.

%The proof follows by induction. In the base case, we have $v=k/a$ so 
%\[
%\CC^{\Gamma}_{v}(x)=\frac12(e^{2\pi i k/a}+e^{-2\pi i k/a})= \cos(2\pi \vert k \vert/ a)= T_{\vert k\vert }(\cos(2\pi k/a)),
%\]
%merely by the definition of the Chebyshev polynomials. Now in general, let $\Gamma_1\leq \Gamma$ be the subgroup of maps fixing the $d$th coordinate, so 
%$G= \Gamma_1\sqcup \Gamma_1 \sigma'$ where $\sigma'$ is the map taking $(x_1,\dots,x_d)\rightarrow (x_1,x_2,\dots,-x_d)$. 
%Also let $p_{d-1}$ be the map projecting $x$ onto its first $d-1$ coordinates, and likewise for $\sigma \in \Gamma$, $\sigma_{d-1}$ will denote the map on $\R^{d-1}$ by restricting $\sigma$ to acting only the first $d-1$ coordinates. Note that $\{ \sigma_{d-1}: \sigma \in \Gamma_1\}$ is the set of coordinate symmetries for $\R^{d-1}$. Thus, we obtain 

%  \begin{align}
%    \CC_v^\Gamma(x)&=  \frac{1}{\vert \Gamma_1\vert}\sum_{\sigma \in \Gamma_1}\frac{e^{2\pi i \sigma v \cdot x}+ e^{2\pi i \sigma \sigma ' v \cdot x}}{2}\\
%    &= \frac{1}{\vert \Gamma_1\vert}\sum_{\sigma \in \Gamma_1} \cos (2\pi \vert k_d\vert x_d /a_d) e^{2\pi i \sigma_{d-1}p_{d-1(v)}\cdot p_{d-1}(x)}    \\
 %   &= \cos (2\pi \vert k_d\vert x_d /a_d) \frac{1}{\vert \Gamma_1\vert}\sum_{\sigma \in \Gamma_1} e^{2\pi i \sigma_{d-1}p_{d-1(v)}\cdot p_{d-1}(x)}\\
%&=T_{ \vert k_d\vert} (\cos(2\pi x_d /a_d)) \prod_{i=1}^{d-1} T_{\vert k_i \vert}(\cos(2\pi x_i /a_i)
%  \end{align}
%  as desired, and we have applied the inductive hypothesis to obtain the final equality. 

\subsection{Linear Programming Bounds for Periodic Energy}
\label{lpboundssection}
We say that  $g\in L^2(\Omega_\Lambda)$ is {\em positive semi-definite (PSD)} if the Fourier coefficients
$\hat{g}_v\ge 0$ for all $v\in\Lambda^*\setminus\{0\}$ and $\sum_{v\in\Lambda^*}\hat{g}_v<\infty$. (This is a slightly nonstandard choice of notation since we are not requiring $\hat{g}_0\ge 0$.)   If $g\in L^2(\Omega_\Lambda)$ is PSD, then  its Fourier series converges uniformly and so, without loss of generality, we may assume that a PSD $g\in L^2(\Omega_\Lambda)$ is continuous and equal to its Fourier series at every $x\in \R^d$. 

If $g\in L^2(\Omega_\Lambda)$ is PSD and $\omega_n$ is an arbitrary $n$-point configuration in $\R^d$, then the following fundamental lower bound holds: 
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
E_{g}(\omega_n)&=\sum_{x\neq y \in \omega_n} g(x-y) = -ng(0)+\sum_{x,y\in \omega_n} g(x-y)\\
&=-ng(0)+\sum_{v\in \Lambda^*}  \hat{g}_v \sum_{x,y\in \omega_n}  e^{2\pi i v\cdot x}e^{-2\pi i v\cdot y} \\
&=-ng(0)+\sum_{v\in \Lambda^*} \hat{g}_v \left\lvert \sum_{x\in \omega_n} e^{2\pi i v\cdot x} \right\rvert^2 
\\
&\geq n^2\hat{g}_0-ng(0) \label{LPg}.
\end{split}
\end{equation}
For $v\in \R^d$  we refer to 
$$M_v(\omega_n):= \sum_{x\in \omega_n} e^{2\pi i v\cdot x}, $$ as the {\em $v$-moment of $\omega_n$}.  Note that equality holds in \eqref{LPg} if and only if 
\begin{equation}\label{LPgEq}
    \hat{g}_v  M_v(\omega_n) = 0, \qquad v\in \Lambda^*\setminus\{0\}.
\end{equation}
The next proposition   follows immediately from \eqref{LPg} and the condition \eqref{LPgEq} for equality in \eqref{LPg}.  This proposition is essentially contained in the proof of the linear programming bounds of \cite[Proposition 9.3]{Cohn_Kumar_2007} and is closely related to Delsarte-Yudin energy bounds for spherical codes (cf. \cite[Chapters 5.5 and 10.4]{MEbook}). 

\begin{proposition}
\label{linearprogramming}
Let $F:\R^d\to [0,\infty]$ be $\Lambda$-periodic, and suppose $g\in L^2(\Omega_\Lambda)$ is PSD  such that $g\le F$. 
 Then for any $n$-point configuration $\omega_n $, we  have 
\begin{equation}
\label{linprogbounds}
E_F(\omega_n)\geq E_g(\omega_n) \geq n^2\hat{g}_0-ng(0)
\end{equation}
with equality holding throughout \eqref{linprogbounds} if and only if the following two conditions hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item[(a)] $g(x-y)=F(x-y)$ for all $x\neq y \in \omega_n$,
\item[(b)]   $\hat{g}_v M_v(\omega_n)=0$, for all $v\in \Lambda^*\setminus \{ 0\}$.
\end{enumerate}
If (a) and (b) hold, then $E_F(\omega_n)=\mathcal{E}_F(n)$. 
\end{proposition}


\begin{remark}
\label{GLambdainvariance}
  If $F:\R^d\to [0,\infty]$ is $\Lambda$-periodic and $G_\Lambda$-invariant and 
$g\in L^2(\Omega_\Lambda)$ is PSD such that $g\le F$, then the $S_\Lambda$-invariant
function 
\begin{equation*}
    g^{\rm sym}(x):=\frac{1}{|G_\Lambda|}\sum_{\sigma\in G_\Lambda}g((\sigma v)\cdot x), \qquad x\in\R^d 
\end{equation*}
is also PSD and satisfies $g^{\rm sym}\le F$.  Thus, we may restrict our search for functions $g$ to use in Proposition~\ref{linearprogramming} to those of the form given in \eqref{FExpG} in which case we only need verify the condition that $g\le F$ on the fundamental domain of the action of $S_\Lambda$ on $\R^d$. In particular, when $\Lambda=A_2$, we have the representative set
\[
\Delta_{A_2}:=\{ (x_1,x_2)\mid 0\leq x_1\leq \frac12,0\leq x_2\leq x_1/\sqrt{3}\}
\]
and when $\Lambda=L$, we'll consider the representative set $[0,1/2]\times[0,\sqrt{3}/2]$.
\end{remark}


\subsection{Moments for certain lattice configurations}
We consider moments of configurations obtained by restricting  scalings of a lattice $\Lambda$ to the fundamental domain of a sublattice $\Phi$.   
\begin{theorem}
\label{generalmoments}
Suppose $\Phi$ is a sublattice of a lattice $\Lambda$ in $\R^d$. Let $\omega_\Phi:=\Lambda\cap \Omega_\Phi$ and $\kappa:=|\omega_\Phi |$ denote the index of $\Phi$ in $\Lambda$.  For $m\in \N$, let
\begin{equation}\label{mukappa}
    \mu_{\kappa m^d}:=(\frac{1}{m}\Lambda)\cap\Omega_\Phi.\end{equation} Then for $v\in \Phi^*$, we have
\begin{equation}\label{MomentForm}
    M_v(\mu_{\kappa m^d})=\begin{cases} \kappa m^d,&  v\in m\Lambda^*,\\
    0,& \text{otherwise.}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Furthermore, if $G_\Phi\subset G_\Lambda$, then for any $v\in \Phi^*$ and $\sigma \in G_\Phi$, we have $M_{\sigma v}(\mu_{\kappa m^d})=M_v(\mu_{\kappa m^d})$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
Let  $\Lambda=V\Z^d$; i.e., $V$ is a generator for $\Lambda$.
 Since $\Phi$ is a sublattice of $\Lambda$, there is some integer $d\times d$ matrix $W$ such that $VW$ is a generator for $\Phi$. Then $W$ is an  that can be written in Smith Normal Form as $W=SDT$ where $S$ and $T$ are integer matrices with  determinant $\pm 1$ (equivalently, their inverses are also integer matrices) and $D$ is a diagonal matrix with positive integer diagonal entries $\lambda_1,\ldots, \lambda_d$.  Then $\widetilde V=VS$ is a generator for $\Lambda$ and $U=\widetilde V D$ is a generator for $\Phi$.  Choosing the fundamental domains $\Omega_\Lambda=\widetilde V[0,1)^d$ and $\Omega_\Phi=U[0,1)^d$  
 we may write 
 $$\mu_{\kappa m^d}=\{\frac{1}{m} \widetilde V j\mid j\in I_{m\lambda_1}\times\cdots \times I_{m\lambda_d}\}, $$ 
 where   $I_p:=\{0,1,2,\ldots,p-1\}$.
    Let $v\in\Phi^*$ so that $v=U^{-T}k={\widetilde V}^{-T}D^{-1}k$  for some $k=(k_1,k_2,\dots,k_d)\in \Z^d.$  Then $v\cdot (\frac{1}{m} \widetilde V j)=\frac{1}{m}j\cdot (D^{-1}k)$ and so
 \begin{align*}
     M_v(\mu_{\kappa m^d})&=
     \sum_{j\in I_{m\lambda_1}\times\cdots \times I_{m\lambda_d}} e^{2\pi i \frac{1}{m}j\cdot D^{-1}k}=
     \prod_{\ell=1}^d\left(\sum_{j_\ell=0}^{m\lambda_\ell -1}e^{2\pi i \frac{j_\ell k_\ell}{m\lambda_\ell}}\right)\\&=\begin{cases}
     m^d\lambda_1\cdots\lambda_d, & k\in mD\Z^d,\\
     0,& \text{otherwise},
 \end{cases}
 \end{align*}
 where we used the finite geometric sum formula in the last equality.  Noting that $\kappa=\lambda_1\cdots\lambda_d$ and that $v\in m\Lambda^*$ if and only if $k\in mD\Z^d$ establishes \eqref{MomentForm}.

 Finally, if   $\sigma\in G_\Phi$ and $G_\Phi\subset G_\Lambda$, then $\sigma v\in m\Lambda^*$ if and only if $v\in m\Lambda^*$ which completes the proof.
\end{proof}
We define the {\em index} of a configuration $\omega_n\subset \R^d$  with respect to a lattice $\Phi\subset \R^d$ by 
\begin{equation}\label{Idef}
   \mathcal{I}_\Phi(\omega_n)=\{v\in\Phi^*\mid M_v(\omega_n)=0\}.
\end{equation}
 It then follows from Theorem~\ref{generalmoments} that 
 $\mathcal{I}_\Phi(\mu_{\kappa m^d})=\Phi^*\setminus (m\Lambda^*)$.
\subsection{Lattice theta functions}

 
For $c>0$, the classical   Jacobi theta function of the third type, is defined by
\begin{equation}
\label{thetasmallaformula}
\theta(c;x):=\sum^{\infty}_{k=-\infty} e^{-\pi k^2 c}e^{2\pi i kx}, \qquad x\in \R.
\end{equation}

Via Poisson Summation on the integers, we have
\begin{equation}
\label{thetabigaformula}
\theta(c;x)=c^{-1/2} \sum^{\infty}_{k=-\infty} e^{-\frac{\pi(k+x)^2}{c}},
\end{equation}
and so
\[
F_{a, \mathbb{Z}}(x)= (a/\pi)^{1/2}\theta(\frac{\pi}{a};x).
\]
We note that $\theta(c;x)$ is $\mathbb{Z}$-periodic and $\theta(c;x)=\theta(c;-x)$ for any $x$.  In terms of our earlier language for periodizing gaussians by lattices, we have
\[
F_{a, \mathbb{Z}}(x)= \sqrt{\frac{a}{\pi}}\theta(\frac{\pi}{a};x).
\]

We'll also use 
\[
\tilde{\theta}(c;t):=\theta\left (c,\frac{\arccos t}{2\pi}\right), \quad t\in [-1,1].
\]
It follows from the symmetries of $\theta(c,x)$ that for all $x\in \R$,
\[
\tilde{\theta}(c;\cos 2\pi x)=\theta(c;x),
\]
and moreover, as shown below, $\tth$ is absolutely monotone  on $[-1,1]$. First, we recall the Jacobi triple product formula.
\begin{theorem}{Jacobi Triple Product Formula}
Let $z,q \in \mathbb{C}$ with $\lvert q \rvert<1$ and $z\neq 0$. Then
\[
\prod^{\infty}_{r=1}(1-q^{2r})(1+q^{2r-1}z^2)(1+q^{2r-1}z^{-2})=\sum^{\infty}_{k=-\infty} q^{k^2}z^{2k}.
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proposition}
\label{absmonotone}
For any $c>0$, $\tilde{\theta}(c; \cdot):[-1,1]\rightarrow(0,\infty)$ is strictly absolutely monotone on $[-1,1]$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Applying the Jacobi triple product with $q=e^{-\pi c}$ and $z=e^{\pi i x}$, we observe
\begin{align}
\theta(c;x)&=\prod^{\infty}_{r=1}(1-e^{-2\pi rc})(1+e^{-(2r-1)\pi c}e^{2\pi i x})
(1+e^{-2\pi rc})(1+e^{-(2r-1)\pi c}e^{-2\pi i x})\\
&= \prod^{\infty}_{r=1}(1-e^{-2\pi rc}) (1+2e^{-2\pi rc}\cos(2\pi x)+ e^{-2(2r-1)\pi c}).
\end{align}
So 
\[
\tilde{\theta}(c;t)= \prod^{\infty}_{r=1}(1-e^{-2\pi rc}) (1+2e^{-2\pi rc}t+ e^{-2(2r-1)\pi c}).
\]
It's elementary to verify that $\tilde{\theta}(c;\cdot)$ is entire and repeated applications of the product rule show the strict absolute monotonicity of $\tilde{\theta}$ on $[-1,1]$.   
\end{proof}
We also have 
\begin{proposition}
\label{logderivcm}
For all $n\in \mathbb{N} \cup \{0\}$ and $t\in [-1,1]$, $\tth$ satisfies 
\[
(-1)^n \left(\frac{\tth'}{\tth}\right)^{(n)}(t) >0. 
\]
In other words, $\frac{\tth'}{\tth}$ is strictly completely monotone.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Our proposition is equivalent to showing that $h'$ is strictly completely monotone, where $h:=\log \tth$.
Recall that $\tth$ can be expressed via the Jacobi triple product as
\[
\tth(c;t)= \prod^{\infty}_{r=1}(1-e^{-2\pi rc}) (1+2e^{-2\pi rc}t+ e^{-2(2r-1)\pi c}).
\]
so 
\[
h=\sum_{r=1}^{\infty} \log\left[ (1-e^{-2\pi rc}) (1+2e^{-2\pi rc}t+ e^{-2(2r-1)\pi c})\right].
\]
Let $h_r$ be the $r$th term in this sum.
It suffices to show that each $h_{r}'$ is strictly completely monotone.
Indeed, we have
\[
h_{r}'=\frac{2e^{-2\pi rc}}{1+2e^{-2\pi rc}t+ e^{-2(2r-1)\pi c}}
\]
so 
\[
[h_{r}']^{(n)}=\frac{(-1)^n[2e^{-2 \pi rc}]^{n+1}}{1+2e^{-2\pi rc}t+ e^{-2(2r-1)\pi c}}
\]
from which the claim follows since $1+2e^{-2\pi rc}t+ e^{-2(2r-1)\pi c}\geq 0$ for all $r,c>0$ and $t\geq-1$. 
\end{proof}

If $\Lambda_R=(a_1\Z)\times \cdots \times(a_d\Z)$ is a rectangular lattice, then $F_{a,\Lambda_R}(x)$ is a tensor product of such functions: 
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
  \label{recF}
  F_{a,\Phi}(x)&=\sum_{v\in\Phi}e^{-a\|x+v\|^2}
  =\sum_{k\in\Z^d}\prod_{i=1}^d e^{-aa_i(x_i/a_i +k_i)^2}\\&=\prod_{i=1}^d\left(\sum_{k_i\in\Z} e^{-aa_i(\frac{x_i}{a_i} +k_i)^2}\right)
  =\prod_{i=1}^dF_{aa_i,\Z}(x_i/a_i).
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
If $\Lambda$ contains a rectangular sublattice $\Lambda_R$, then we may write $F_\Lambda$ as a sum of such tensor products.

\begin{proposition}
\label{thetafnrectlattice}
Suppose $\Lambda$ is a lattice in $\R^d$ that contains a 
rectangular sublattice $\Lambda_R=(a_1\Z)\times \cdots\times (a_d\Z)$ and let $\omega_\Phi=\Lambda\cap \Omega_{\Lambda_R}$.   Then
\begin{equation}\label{Frec}
    F_{a,\Lambda}(x)
    =\sum_{y\in\omega_{\Lambda_R}} F_{a,\Lambda_R}(x+y).
\end{equation}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
The formula follows immediately from  $\Lambda=\omega_\Phi+\Phi$.
\end{proof}
\subsection{Polynomial interpolation and linear programming bounds for lattice configurations}
Combining the previous results in this section, we obtain the following general polynomial interpolation framework for linear programming bounds.  For  convenience, we shall write 
\begin{equation}
 W_\Phi := \Phi^*/G_\Phi \text{ and }  \Delta_\Phi:= \R^d/S_\Phi,
\end{equation}
to denote some choice of the respective fundamental domains for a lattice $\Phi\subset \R^d$.
\begin{theorem}
\label{genlinpoly}
Let $\Phi \subset \R^d$ be such that $H\subseteq 
G_\Phi$ where $H$ is the 
coordinate symmetry group (see Sec. 
\ref{latticesymmetry}) and suppose $F:\R^d\to (-\infty,\infty]$ is $S_\Phi$ invariant. By Proposition 
\ref{polystruct},  $\Phi$ contains a rectangular sublattice 
\[
a_1 \Z \times \cdots\times a_d \Z, 
\]
which induces the change of variables $T:=T_{a_1,\ldots,a_d}$ defined in \eqref{Ttransformation} and associated polynomials $P^{G_\Phi}_{v}$ defined in \eqref{tildeP}. 
Suppose $a>0$ and $(c_v)_{v\in W_\Phi}$ is such that (a) 
$c_v\ge 0$, for all nonzero $  v\in W_\Phi$ , (b) $\sum_{v\in W_\Phi}c_v<\infty$, and 
(c)  the continuous function
\[
\tg_a:= c_0+\sum_{v\in W\_Phi} c_v P^{G_\Phi}_{v}. 
\]
satisfies $\tg_{a}\leq \tf$ on $\tilde{\Delta}_\Phi$.
 
Then for any $n$-point configuration $\omega_n=\{x_1,\ldots,x_n\}\subset \R^d$, we have \begin{equation}
    \label{TildeLB}
E_{F_{a,\Phi}}(\omega_n) \geq 
E_{g_{a}}(\omega_n)=n^2 c_0- n \tg_{a}(1,\ldots, 1),
\end{equation}
where   equality holds   if and only if 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\tg_a(t)=\tf_{a,\Phi}(t)$ for all $t\in T(\{x_i-x_j\mid i\neq j \in\{1,\ldots,n\}\})$ and 
    \item $c_v M_{\sigma v}(\omega_n)=0$ for all $v\in W_\Phi$ and $\sigma \in G_{\Phi}$.
\end{enumerate}  
\end{theorem}

We now consider sufficient conditions to for the $F$-optimality  of configurations of the 
form $\mu_{\kappa m^d}=\frac{1}{m}\Lambda \cap \Omega_\Phi$ as in \eqref{mukappa}.   For such a configuration we define
\begin{equation}
    \tau_{\kappa m^d}:=(\frac{1}{m}\Lambda) \cap \Delta_\Phi),
    \end{equation}
which equals  $\mu_{\kappa m^d}\cap\Delta_\Phi$ if we choose $\Delta_\Phi\subset \Omega_\Phi.$

\begin{corollary}
\label{mukd}
Suppose $\Phi$,  $T:=T_{a_1,\ldots,a_d}$, $\tg_a$, and $F$ are as in Theorem \ref{genlinpoly} and   that $\Phi\subseteq \Lambda$, and $G_\Phi \subseteq G_\Lambda$ for some lattice $\Lambda\subset \R^d$. 
Then the configuration 
$\mu_{\kappa m^d}=\frac{1}{m}\Lambda \cap \Omega_\Phi$   defined in Prop. \ref{generalmoments} is $F$-optimal if
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $c_v=0$ for all   $v  \in \left(m \Lambda^*\right)\cap W_\Phi$, and 
    \item  $\tg_a(t) = \tf_{a,\Phi}(t)$ for all $t  \in \tilde {\tau}_{\kappa m^d}\setminus \{\mathbf{1}\}$ where 
     $\mathbf{1}=(1,1,\ldots,1)\in\R^d$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{corollary}
If such a $\tg_a$ exists, we refer to it as a `magic' interpolant. 


\section{The Linear Programming Framework for the families $\omega_{m^2},\omega_{2m^2},\omega_{3m^2},$ and $\omega_{6m^2}$}
\label{sec3}
We explicitly apply Corollary \ref{mukd} linear programming framework for the four families of periodic problems described in the introduction to obtain bivariate polynomial interpolation problems whose solutions would verify the $A_2$-universal optimality of $\omega_{m^2}$ and $\omega_{3m^2}$, and the $L$-universal optimality of $\omega_{2m^2}$ and $\omega_{6m^2}$. 
Observe that our four families of point configurations are of the form $\mu_{\kappa m^2}$ with the following choices of rectangular lattice $ \Phi \subseteq \Lambda$:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\omega^*_{m^2}$: $\Phi=A_2, \Lambda=A_2$
    \item $\omega^*_{2m^2}$: $\Phi=L, \Lambda=A_2$
    \item $\omega^*_{3m^2}$: $\Phi=A_2, \Lambda=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}A_2^{\pi/6}$
    \item $\omega^*_{3m^2}$: $\Phi=L, \Lambda=\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}A_2^{\pi/6}$.
\end{enumerate}
It is straightforward to check that in all cases, $\Phi$ and $\Lambda$ satisfy the conditions of Theorem \ref{genlinpoly}. 
Since both choices of $\Phi$, $A_2$ and $L$, contain $L$ as a rectangular sublattice, we will work with the following change of variables to induce our polynomial structure, as described in Proposition \ref{polystruct}:  
\begin{align}
(t_1,t_2):=\left(\cos(2\pi x_1),\cos \left(\frac{2\pi x_2}{\sqrt{3}}\right)\right).
\end{align}
We will use $T$ to denote
the change of variables $T(x)=(t_1(x_1),t_2(x_2))$.

Importantly, the maps $F_{a,\Phi}$ are also well-behaved under this change of variables, as seen through decomposing $F_{a,\Phi}$ into $\theta$ functions as described in Proposition \ref{Frec}.


When $\Phi=L$, we apply Prop. \ref{rectvars} to obtain 
\begin{align}\label{FaL}
F_{a,L}(x)=\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{3}a}\theta(\frac{\pi}{a};x_1)\theta(\frac{\pi}{3a};\frac{x_2}{ \sqrt{3}}).
\end{align}
As a result,
\begin{align*}
\tf_{a,L}(t_1,t_2)&:=F(\frac{ \arccos(t_1)}{2\pi},\frac{ \sqrt{3}\arccos(t_2)}{2\pi})\\
&=
\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{3}a }\theta(\frac{\pi}{a };\frac{\arccos(t_1)}{2\pi})\theta(\frac{\pi}{3a };\frac{\arccos(t_2)}{2\pi})\\
&=
\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{3}a }
\tth(\frac{\pi}{a };t_1)\tth(\frac{\pi}{3a };t_2)
\end{align*}
for $t_1,t_2 \in [-1,1]$.
Thus, for fixed $t_1\in [-1,1]$, $\tf_{a,L}$ is strictly absolutely monotone as a function of $t_2$ and vice versa. We will use the absolute monotonicity in $t_1$ and $t_2$ repeatedly, and the symmetry of this formula for $\tf$ is one of the main motivations for considering the sublattice $L$. 





On the other hand, when $\Phi= A_2$, we arrive at the following formula, a consequence of Proposition \ref{Frec}, which also appears in \cite{Baernstein_1997} and \cite{Su_2015}:
\begin{equation}\label{FaA2}
F(x):=F_{a,A_2}(x)=\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{3}a}\left(
\theta(\frac{\pi}{a};x_1) 
\theta(\frac{\pi}{3 a};\frac{x_2}{\sqrt{3}})+ 
\theta(\frac{\pi}{3 a};\frac{x_2}{\sqrt{3}}+\frac{1}{2})
\theta(\frac{\pi}{a};x_1+\frac{1}{2})\right),
\end{equation}
which gives
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
\tilde F(t)&:=F(\frac{\arccos t_1}{2\pi},\frac{ \sqrt{3}\arccos t_2}{2\pi})\\
&=\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{3}a}( \tilde{\theta}(\frac{\pi}{ a};t_1)  \tilde{\theta}(\frac{\pi}{ 3a};t_2 ) +\tilde{\theta}(\frac{\pi}{a};-t_1)\tilde{\theta}(\frac{\pi}{ 3a};-t_2)
 ).
\end{split} 
\end{equation}


The next corollary follows immediately from the absolute monotonicity of $\tth$ (see Proposition \ref{absmonotone}). 
\begin{corollary}
\label{evenpartials}
For any nonnegative integers $l_1$ and $l_2$ satisfying $l_1+l_2\equiv 0 \pmod 2$,
\[
\frac{\partial^{l_1+l_2}\tf}{\partial^{l_1} t_1 \partial^{l_2} t_2 }>0, \quad \forall t_1,t_2 \in [-1,1].
\]
\end{corollary}
Finally, we have the following lemma from \cite{Baernstein_1997} (also see \cite{Su_2015}). 
\begin{lemma}
\label{pospartials}
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1}(t_1,t_2)&> 0 \quad \forall t_1 \in [-1,1], \forall t_2 \in [-1,1]\\
\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_2}(t_1,t_2)&\geq 0 \quad \forall t_1 \in [-1,1], \forall t_2 \in [-1,1]
\end{align}
where the equality holds if and only if $t_1=-1$, $t_2=\frac12$.  In particular, these inequalities hold in the entire $t_1,t_2$ region.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Since even partial deriviatives of $\tf$ are positive and every point $(t_1,t_2)\in \td$ satisfies $t_1\geq -1$ and $t_2\geq \frac12$, it suffices to verify the inequalities 
\[
\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1}(t_1,t_2)> 0 , \frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_2}(t_1,t_2)\geq 0
\]
at $(-1,\frac1 2)$. See \cite{Baernstein_1997} or \cite{Su_2015}.  
\end{proof}
As observed in \cite{Su_2015} (also see \cite[Chapter 10]{MEbook} 
and \cite{Faulhuber_2023}), this Lemma \ref{pospartials} suffices to proves the $A_2$-universal optimality of the 2 and 3-point configurations discussed in the introduction (see section \ref{interp3msq} for more detail). 
%Indeed, the lemma implies that $\tf$ is minimized at $(-1,1/2)$, and so equivalently, $F$ is minimized at $(1/2, \sqrt{3}/6)$. But then it is elementary to check that every nonzero difference $x-y$ from the 2 and 3 point configurations equals (up to $S_{A_2}$ actions) $(1/2, \sqrt{3}/6)$, and so these configurations must minimize $F$-energy as claimed.\\


%\begin{proof}
%\begin{align}
%F(x)&=\sum_{v\in [u_0,l_0]\mathbb{Z}^2}e^{-a\lvert[ x_1,x_2]^T+v\rvert^2}\\
%&=\sum_{m,n \in \mathbb{Z}}e^{-a\lvert[ x_1,x_2]^T+mu_0+nl_0\rvert^2}\\
%&=\sum_{m,n \in \mathbb{Z}}e^{-a\left[ (x_1+  m)^2+(x_2+  \sqrt{3}n)^2\right]^2}\\
%&=\sum_{m \in \mathbb{Z}}e^{-a (x_1+  m)^2}
%\sum_{n\in \mathbb{Z}}e^{-a(x_2+  \sqrt{3}n)^2}\\
%&=\sum_{m \in \mathbb{Z}}e^{-a (x_1+  m)^2}
%\sum_{n\in \mathbb{Z}}e^{-a(x_2+  \sqrt{3}n)^2}\\
%&=\sum_{m \in \mathbb{Z}}e^{-a ^2 (x_1+ m)^2}
%\sum_{n\in \mathbb{Z}}e^{-3a(\frac{x_2}{\sqrt{3}}+n)^2}\\
%&=\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a }}
%\theta(\frac{\pi}{a };x_1)\sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a \sqrt{3}}}\theta(\frac{\pi}{3a };\frac{x_2}{  \sqrt{3}})\\
%&=\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{3}a }\theta(\frac{\pi}{a };x_1)\theta(\frac{\pi}{3a };\frac{x_2}{ \sqrt{3}}).
%\end{align}
%\end{proof}




We will also make the following choices of fundamental domains $\R^2/S_{\Phi}$ and $\Phi^*/ G_{\Phi}$. When $\Phi=L$, we take as a choice for  $\Phi^*/ G_{L}$ the set 
\[
W_{L}:=\left\{\begin{bmatrix}
    k_1\\
    k_2/\sqrt{3}
\end{bmatrix} \mid k_1,k_2\in \Z \text{ and }k_1,k_2\geq 0\right\}
\]
and $[0,1/2]\times[0,\sqrt{3}/2]$ for $\R^2/S_{L}$. Likewise for $A_2$, we take the sets 
\[
W_{A_2}:= \left\{
\begin{bmatrix}
    k_1\\
    k_2/\sqrt{3}
\end{bmatrix}\in L^*\mid 
 0\le k_2\le  k_1 \text{ and } k_1\equiv k_2  \pmod 2 \, \right\}
\]
and $\Delta_{A_2}$ (see Sec. \ref{lpboundssection}) for $\Phi^*/ G_{A_2}$ and $\R^2/S_{A_2}$, respectively. 

Finally, the following characterizations of the dual lattices $\Lambda$ will be useful for determining which degree polynomials are available to us for interpolation. First,
$L^*=\{[k_1,k_2/\sqrt{3}]^T \mid k_1,k_2\in \Z\}$. Then $A_2^*=\{ v\in L^*\mid v\cdot e_1 \equiv v\cdot \sqrt{3}e_2 \pmod 2\}$, and $\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}A_2^{\pi/6}\right)^*=\{ v\in A_2^*\mid v\cdot \sqrt{3}e_2 \equiv 0 \pmod 3\}$. Thus, the set of  all $v$ for which $c_v$ may be non-zero in the construction of an interpolant $\tg_a$ are expressed by the index sets defined
\small
\begin{align}
\mathcal{I}_{m^2}:=\mathcal{I}_{A_2}(\omega_{m^2}^*)\cap W_{A_2}& =  W_{A_2}/(mA_2^*)\\
&=\{[k_1,k_2/\sqrt{3}] \mid k_1,k_2 \geq 0, k_1 \equiv k_2 \bmod 2, [k_1,k_2]\neq m[j_1,j_2]\}\\
\mathcal{I}_{2m^2}:= \mathcal{I}_{L}(\omega_{2m^2}^*)\cap W_{L}&=W_{L}/(mA_2^*)\\
&=
\{[k_1,k_2/\sqrt{3}] \mid k_1,k_2 \geq 0, [k_1,k_2]\neq m[j_1,j_2] \text{ for some } j_1 \equiv j_2 (\bmod 2)\}
\\
\mathcal{I}_{3m^2}
:=\mathcal{I}_{A_2}(\omega_{3m^2}^*)\cap W_{A_2}&=  W_{A_2}/(mA_2^*)
\\
&=\{[k_1,k_2/\sqrt{3}] \mid k_1,k_2 \geq 0, k_1 \equiv k_2 \bmod 2, [k_1,k_2]\neq m[j_1,j_2] \text{ for some } j_2\equiv 0\bmod 3\}\\
\mathcal{I}_{6m^2}:=\mathcal{I}_{L}(\omega_{6m^2}^*)\cap W_{L}&=W_{L}/(mA_2^*)\\
&=
\{[k_1,k_2/\sqrt{3}] \mid k_1,k_2 \geq 0, [k_1,k_2]\neq m[j_1,j_2] \text{ for some } j_1 \equiv j_2 (\bmod 2), j_2 \equiv 0 \bmod 3\}.
\end{align}

\subsection{The Polynomials $P^{L}_{v}$ and  $P^{A_2}_{v}$}
\label{G2polynomials}
When $\Phi=L$, we have already shown that the functions are $P^{L}_v$ are tensors of Chebyshev Polynomials 
\[
P^{L}_v= T_{k_1}(t_1) T_{k_2}(t_2)
\]
where $v=[k_1,k_2/\sqrt{3}]^T$, $k_1,k_2\geq 0$ is an arbitrary element of $W_L$. 
(see Proposition \ref{rectvars}).\\
What can be said in the case when $\Phi=A_2$? These polynomials have been studied extensively (see \cite{Sun_2007}, \cite{Li_Sun_Xu_2012}, and references therein). Of particular importance to  $P^{A_2}_v$ are the polynomials $P_{v'}$ and $P_{v''}$, where $v'=[1,1/\sqrt{3}]^T$ is the shortest non-zero vector in $W_{A_2}$ and we'll let $v''=[2,0]^T$ be the next shortest vector. 
We have
\begin{align}
P_{v'}&=\frac13 (-1+2t_2(t_1+t_2)),\\
P_{v''}&=\frac13 (-1+2 t_1 (t_1-3 t_2+4 t_2^3)).
\end{align} 
It turns out that every other $P_{v}$ can be expressed as a bivariate polynomial in $P_{v'}$ and $P_{v''}$, i.e. for any $v\in A_2^*$, there exist coefficients $c_{i,j}$ (with only finitely many nonzero) such that 
\[
P_{v}=\sum_{i,j\geq 0}c_{i,j} (-1+2t_2(t_1+t_2))^i (-1+2 t_1 (t_1-3 t_2+4 t_2^3))^j
\]
First, note that since $P_{v'}$ and $P_{v''}$ contain only monomials of even total degree, the same is true of arbitrary $P_{v}$
To further understand these bivariate polynomials, we set $\alpha=P_{v'} $, $\beta=P_{v''}$ and introduce a notion of degree on monomials introduced in \cite{Patera_2010}:
\begin{definition}
The $A_2$-degree of a bivariate monomial $\alpha^{k_0}\beta^{k_1}$ is $2k_0+3k_1$.
\end{definition}
If $v\in W_{A_2}$, then $v=k_0 v' + k_1 v^*$ for some unique $k_0,k_1 \geq 0$, and so we can likewise introduce the notion of the $A_2$ degree of $v\in W_{A_2}$ as $2k_0+3k_1$. We will denote the degree function as $\mathcal{D}$ for both monomials and elements of $W_{A_2}$. 
Now we can introduce an ordering on monomials by $m$-degree and break ties via the power of $\alpha$. Then the leading term (by $A_2$-degree) of $P_v$ is $\alpha^{k_0}\beta^{k_1}$. Certainly, this is true for our first polynomials, $P_{0}=1$, $P_{v'}=\alpha$, and $P_{v''}=\beta$, and then an examination of the recursion generating the polynomials shows that the claim holds inductively  (cf. \cite{Li_Sun_Xu_2012}).

\subsection{Interpolation Nodes}
Our final step is to calculate for each family the nodes at which a hypothetical interpolant $\tg_a$ must interpolate $\tf_{a,\Phi}$ to meet the conditions of our linear programming bounds (including $0$ to simplify formulas). We end up with
\begin{align}
\tau_{\kappa m^2}&:=\omega_{\kappa m^2}\cap \Delta_{A_2}, \hspace{1cm}\kappa=1,3\\
\tau_{\kappa m^2}&:=\omega_{\kappa m^2}\cap ([0,1/2]\times[0,\sqrt{3}/2]),\hspace{1cm}\kappa=2,6.
\end{align}
Going straight from the definitions of $\omega_{\kappa m^2}$ and our $t_1,t_2$ change of variables, we then compute
\begin{align}
\tilde{\tau}_{m^2}&=\left\{ \left(\cos(\frac{\pi k_1}{m}),\cos(\frac{\pi k_2}{m})\right)\mid 0\leq 3k_2\leq k_1\leq m, k_1\equiv k_2 (\bmod 2) \right\}\\
\tilde{\tau}_{2m^2}&=\left\{ \left(\cos(\frac{\pi k_1}{m}),\cos(\frac{\pi k_2}{m})\right)\mid 0\leq k_1,k_2\leq m, k_1\equiv k_2 (\bmod 2) \right\}\\
\tilde{\tau}_{3m^2}&=\left\{ \left(\cos(\frac{\pi k_1}{m}),\cos(\frac{\pi k_2}{3m})\right)\mid 0\leq k_2\leq k_1\leq m, k_1\equiv k_2 (\bmod 2) \right\}\\
\tilde{\tau}_{6m^2}&=\left \{ \left(\cos(\frac{\pi k_1}{m}),\cos(\frac{\pi k_2}{3m})\right)\mid 0\leq 3k_1,k_2\leq 3m, k_1\equiv k_2 (\bmod 2) \right\}.
\end{align}

\subsection{Interpolation Problem for $\omega_{m^2}$} 
With all the machinery now set up, we address the family $\omega_{m^2}^*$ and its base case,  $\omega_{4}^*$.  Recall $v':=[1, 1/\sqrt{3}]$ is the shortest vector in $W_{A_2}$ and   
$P_{v'}=\frac13 (-1+2t_2(t_1+t_2))$. In Section~\ref{section4}, we prove the $A_2$-universal optimality of the base case $\omega_4^*$ by constructing for each $a>0$  a polynomial of the form
$g_a(t_1,t_2):=c_0+c_1 P_{v'}(t_1,t_2)$
with $c_1\ge 0$ such that $g_a\le F_{a,A_2}$.

% Figure environment removed

For general $m$, recalling  the background on $G_2$ polynomials in Sec. \ref{G2polynomials}, we note that 
\[
\{ v\in W_{A_2}\mid  \mathcal{D}(v) < 2m\}\subset \mathcal{I}_{m^2}.
\]
The containment holds because if $v=k_0 v'+k_1v''$ and $\mathcal{D}(v) < 2m$, then $k_0< m$, and so $v\not \in mA_2^*$ (i.e. $v \in \mathcal{I}_{m^2}$).
For the $m=2$ base case already discussed, 
our interpolant $\tg_a$ satisfies 
\[
\tg_a \in 
\text{span}\{ P_{v}: v\in \Delta_{A_2}, \mathcal{D}(v)< 2m \}.
\]
\subsection{Interpolation Problem for $\omega^*_{2m^2}$}
Now to the case of $\omega^*_{2m^2}$ with base case $\omega^*_{2}$.
% Figure environment removed


The universal optimality of $\omega^*_{2}$  follows from 
\[
F_{a,L}(x)=\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{3}a}
\theta(\frac{\pi}{a};x_1) 
\theta(\frac{\pi}{3 a};\frac{x_2}{\sqrt{3}}),
\]
which takes its minimum at $(1/2,\sqrt{3}/2)$ for all $a$, as $\theta(c,x)$ takes its minimum at $x=1/2$ for all $c>0$ (see Proposition \ref{absmonotone}). 
Since the $F_{a,L}$ energy of a two-point configuration is determined only by the difference of the two points in the configuration, the universal optimality of $\omega^*_2$ immediately follows, and the same argument can be used to show for any rectangular lattice (cf. \cite{Faulhuber_2023}) that a point at the origin and a point at the centroid of a rectangular fundamental domain yield a 2-point universally optimal configuration. 

For the general case, 
\[
\{ [k_1,k_2/\sqrt{3}]^T: 0\leq k_1,k_2 \text{ and } k_1+k_2< 2m\} \subseteq\mathcal{I}_{2m^2},
\]
and then
\[
\text{span}\{P_{v} \mid v=
[k_1,k_2/\sqrt{3}]^T: 0\leq k_1,k_2 \text{ and } 
k_1+k_2< 2m\}= \mathcal{P}_{2m-1}(t_1,t_2),
\]
where
$\mathcal{P}_n(t_1,t_2)$ is the set of bivariate polynomials of total degree at most $n$. 
For the first non-trivial case, $\omega^*_{8}$, 
we have numerical evidence that for each $a>0$, an interpolant $\tg_a$ exists in $P_{3}$ and satisfies the conditions of Corollary \ref{mukd}.

\subsection{Interpolation Problems for $\omega^*_{3m^2}$}
\label{interp3msq}
Now to the case of $\omega^*_{3m^2}$ with base case $\omega^*_{3}$.
% Figure environment removed
The universal optimality of $\omega^*_{3}$ (cf. \cite{Su_2015} and \cite{Faulhuber_2023}) follows from Lemma \ref{pospartials}, which is used to show %representation
%\[
%F(x):=F_{a,A_2}(x)=\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{3}a}\left(
%\theta(\frac{\pi}{a};x_1) 
%\theta(\frac{\pi}{3 a};\frac{x_2}{\sqrt{3}})+ 
%\theta(\frac{\pi}{3 a};\frac{x_2}{\sqrt{3}}+\frac{1}{2})
%\theta(\frac{\pi}{a};x_1+\frac{1}{2})\right).
%\]
%Baernstein uses the representation to shows that 
a global minimum of $F_{a,A_2}$ occurs at $(1/2,\sqrt{3}/6)$ for all $a$. This point, $(1/2,\sqrt{3}/6)$, is also the only difference $x-y$ (up to $S_{A_2}$ action) for $x,y\in \omega^*_6$. Thus for an arbitrary 6-point configuration $\omega_6$, we have
\[
E_F(\omega_6)\geq 6 F(1/2,\sqrt{3}/6)=E_F(\omega^*_6)
\]
and so $\omega^*_6$ is $A_2$-universally optimal. This same line of argument is also used in \cite{Su_2015} to show that the 2-point honeycomb configurations pictured below are $A_2$-universally optimal.

More generally, we suggest invoking $A_2$-degree as in the $m^2$ case to find a nice subset of $\mathcal{I}_{3m^2}$. We have the containment 
\[
\{ v\in W_{A_2}\mid  \mathcal{D}(v) < 3m\}\subset \mathcal{I}_{3m^2}.
\]
The containment holds because if $v=k_0 v'+k_1v''$ and $\mathcal{D}(v) < 3m$, then either $v\not \in mA_2^*$ or $v=m v'\not \in (\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}A_2^{\pi/6})^*$.

\subsection{Interpolation Problems for $\omega^*_{6m^2}$} \label{6ptInProb}
It remains to consider the family $\omega_6^*$ and its base case $\omega_{6}^*$, whose universal optimality involves our most complex application of the linear programming bounds.
In section \ref{section6}, we prove the $L$-universal optimality of $\omega^*_6$ by constructing for each $a>0$ an interpolant of the 
form 
\[
g_a(t_1,t_2)
=
b_{0,0}+b_{1,0}t_1 +b_{0,1}t_2+ b_{1,1}t_1t_2+b_{0,2}t^{2}_2
\]
where  $b_{i,j}\geq 0$ for $(i,j)\neq 0$. In that section, we will explain in greater detail why such a $\tg_a$ satisfies the conditions of Corollary \ref{mukd}.

% Figure environment removed
Finally, for arbitrary $m$, we propose a few nice subsets of $\mathcal{I}_{6m^2}$. First, we have the set
\[
\{
[k_1,k_2/\sqrt{3}]^T: 0\leq k_1 <2m, 0\leq k_2 < 3m
\}
\subseteq 
\mathcal{I}_{6m^2},
\]
and 
\[
\text{span}\{P_{v} \mid v=
[k_1,k_2/\sqrt{3}]^T: 0\leq k_1< 2m 0\leq k_2<3m \}= \mathcal{P}_{2m-1}(t_1)\times \mathcal{P}_{3m-1}(t_2).
\]
Working with such a tensor space of polynomials is natural due to the tensor product nature of 
\[
\tf_{a,L}(x)=\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{3}a}
\tth(\frac{\pi}{a};t_1) 
\tth(\frac{\pi}{3 a};t_2).
\]
Notably, our interpolant, $\tg_a$, for $\omega^*_6$ satisfies $\tg_a \in \mathcal{P}_{1}(t_1)\times \mathcal{P}_{2}(t_2)$.

\section{Universal Optimality of $\omega^*_{4}$}
\label{section4}
To prove $\omega^*_{4}$ is $A_2$-universally optimal, it remains to show
for each $a>0$ that there are $c_0,c_1\in \R$ with $c_1\geq 0$ such that the resulting interpolant $\tg_a(t_1,t_2):=c_0+c_1 P_{v'}=c_0+c_1/3(-1+t_2(t_1+t_2))$ satisfies $\tg_a\leq \tf_a$ on $\td$ with equality at $(-1,1)$  or, equivalently,   finding such an interpolant of the form 
\begin{equation}\label{ga4}\
\tg_a(t_1,t_2):= \tf_a(-1,1)+b_1 t_2(t_1+t_2)
\end{equation}
for $b_1\ge 0$. 
\\
Our formulas for $\tg_a$ are defined piecewise\footnote{We suspect that $b_1$ need not be defined piecewise. In fact the choice $b_1= \frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_2 }\bigg|_{-1,1}$ numerically appears to lead to $\tg_a\leq \tf_a$ for all $a>0$. But our most simple proofs come from this piecewise definition of $b_1$.} in $a$. We set 

\begin{equation}
\label{coeffchoice4pt}
b_1=
\begin{cases}
    2\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1 }\bigg|_{-1,1/2} & \text{if } 0< a< 21\\
    \frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_2 }\bigg|_{-1,1} & \text{if } a\geq 21.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

Due to the convergence properties of different formulas for $\theta$ (see \eqref{thetasmallaformula} and \eqref{thetabigaformula}), we find it convenient to rescale $\tf$ by a factor of $\sqrt{3}\pi/a$ for small $a$ case.  Defining
\begin{equation}\label{f1f2Def}
\begin{split}
    \tfo(t_1)&:=\begin{cases}
    \tth(\frac{\pi}{a };t_1),& 0<a\le\pi^2\\
    \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{a}}\tth(\frac{\pi}{a };t_1)& a>\pi^2,
    \end{cases}\\
   \tft(t_2)&:=\begin{cases}
    \tth(\frac{\pi}{a };t_2),& 0<a\le\pi^2\\
    \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{3a}}\tth(\frac{\pi}{a };t_2)& a>\pi^2.
    \end{cases}     
\end{split}
    \end{equation} 


 
With this rescaling convention, it follows from   \eqref{FaA2} that 
\begin{equation}\label{Ff1f2}
\tf(t_1,t_2) =\tfo(t_1)\tft(t_2)+\tfo(-t_1)\tft(-t_2). 
\end{equation}


\subsection{Constructing magic $\tg_a$}
For all $a>0$, we will establish
\begin{lemma}\label{3rdorderpartial}
For all points $(t_1',t_2')\in \td$,
$\displaystyle\frac{\partial^3 \tf}{\partial t_1 \partial t_{2}^2 }\bigg|_{t_1',t_2'} \geq 0.
$
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof} 
Since even partial derivatives of $\tf$ are positive, it suffices to check the inequality at the minimal $t_1$ and $t_2$ values, when $t_1=-1$ and $t_2'=\frac12$. This check is handled in in the appendix with large $a$ and small $a$ cases handled separately.
\end{proof}
Likewise, we have 
\begin{lemma}
\label{vertbdry}
Let $\tilde{h}$ be of the form 
$\tf(-1,1)+c_1 t_2(t_1+ t_2)$ such that 
$\tilde{h}(-1,1/2)\leq \tf(-1,1/2) $ and 
$\frac{\partial \tf-\tilde{h}}{\partial t_2}\bigg|_{-1,1}\leq 0$. 
Then for all $t_2\in [1/2,1]$, $\tf(-1,t_2)\geq \tilde{h}(-1,t_2)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We abuse notation here and use $\tf,\tilde{h}$ to refer to the one variable functions in $t_2$ obtained by fixing $t_1=-1$.
By assumption on the form of $\tilde{h}$, Lemma \ref{pospartials}, and the two assumed inequalities, we have $\tf(1/2)\geq \tilde{h}(1/2)$, $\tf'(1/2)=\tilde{h}'(1/2)=0$ $\tf(1)= \tilde{h}(1)$, and $\tf'(1)\leq \tilde{h}'(1)$. It follows that there are exists some point in $[1/2,1]$ at which $\tf''\leq \tilde{h}''$. Let $t_2'\leq t_2''$ be such that $t_2'$ and $t_2''$ respectively are the minimal and maximal points in $[1/2,1]$ at which $\tf''\leq \tilde{h}''$. For $t_2\geq t_2''$ we have $\tf''\geq \tilde{h}''$ and so we get $\tf\geq \tilde{h}$ by bounding $\tf-\tilde{h}$ below with a tangent line of $\tf-\tilde{h}$ at $1$. Similarly, for $t_2\leq t_2'$, we get the desired inequality with tangent approximation from $\frac12$. For $t_2 \in[ t_2'',t_2']$, we note that $\tf''=\tilde{h}''$ at the endpoints of the interval and $(\tf-\tilde{h}){''}$ is convex (since $\tf^{(4)}>0$), so $(\tf-\tilde{h})''\leq 0$ for the whole interval. Thus, $\tf(t_2)\geq \tilde{h}(t_2)$ by bounding the difference below with its secant line (since we've already established $\tf \geq \tilde{h}$ at the endpoints). 
\end{proof}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%SMALL A
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Small $a$}
Let $0<a\leq 21$. We will refer to $\tg_a$ as simply $\tg$.

Next, we claim that for this range of $a$, the following inequalities hold:
\[
\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_2}\bigg|_{-1,1},
4(\tf(-1,1)-\tf(-1,1/2))
\leq 
2\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1 }\bigg|_{-1,1/2} 
\leq \frac{\partial^2 (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1 \partial t_2}\bigg|_{-1,1/2}.
\]
Moreover, we claim that these 3 inequalities\footnote{Though in the small $a$ case, we have set $b_1=2\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1 }\bigg|_{-1,1/2}$ for simplicity, in fact, we could set $b_1$ to be any element of the (non-empty) interval
$\left[\max\left\{ \frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_2}\bigg|_{-1,1},
4(\tf(-1,1)-\tf(-1,1/2))\right\},2\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1 }\bigg|_{-1,1/2}\right]$ and the exact same proof would work.}
suffice to show $\tf \leq \tg$.

Let's first address why these 3 inequalities are sufficient. Assume they hold, then first off we certainly have $b_1 \geq 0$ since $b_1=2\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1 }\bigg|_{-1,1/2}\geq \frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_2}\bigg|_{-1,1}\geq 0$ where the first inequality holds by assumption and the next by Lemma \ref{pospartials}. Next, we have 
\[
(\tf-\tg)(-1,1/2)=\tf(-1,1/2)-\tf(-1,1)+\frac14 b_1\geq 0
\]
and likewise
\[
\frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_2}\bigg|_{-1,1}=\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_2}\bigg|_{-1,1}-b_1 \leq 0. 
\]

Applying Lemma \ref{vertbdry} and the previous two inequalities to $\tg$, we obtain $\tf\geq \tg$ for all points $(-1,t_2)$ with $t_2\in [1/2,1]$, and since $\tf-\tg$ is convex in $t_1$, it remains to show that $\frac{\partial( \tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\geq 0$ for all points of the form $(-1,t_2)$, $t_2\in[1/2,1]$ (recall the picture of $\td$, Figure \ref{4ptinterpolationpicture}). 
By Lemma \ref{3rdorderpartial}, $\frac{\partial( \tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}$ is convex in $t_2$ in $\td$, so we just need to show 
\[
\frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1 }\bigg|_{-1,1/2}\geq 0,
    \frac{\partial^2 (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1 \partial t_2}\bigg|_{-1,1/2}\geq 0.
\]
But these follow directly from our assumptions on $b_1$. 
Indeed,
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1 }\bigg|_{-1,1/2}&=\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1 }\bigg|_{-1,1/2}- \frac{b_1}{2} = 0\\
    \frac{\partial^2 (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1 \partial t_2}\bigg|_{-1,1/2}&=\frac{\partial^2 \tf}{\partial t_1 \partial t_2}\bigg|_{-1,1/2}-b_1 \geq 0.
\end{align}
Thus, it remains to establish the following\footnote{The reason we don't use this approach for all $a>9.6$ is Lemma \ref{inequalitystring} fails at roughly $a=22$. Namely, the terms $\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_2}\bigg|_{-1,1},
4(\tf(-1,1)-\tf(-1,1/2))$ both have lead exponential terms on the order of $e^{-a/4}$, while $\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1 }\bigg|_{-1,1/2}$ is on the order of $e^{-a/3}$.}
is the same as for $0<a<\pi^2$, but we use estimates on $\tth$ derived from the `large $a$' formula for $\tth$. So for this range it suffices to show in the appendix that Lemma \ref{inequalitystring} holds for $9.6\leq a\leq 21$. in the appendix:
\begin{lemma}
\label{inequalitystring}
For $0<a<\pi^2$, we have \[
\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_2}\bigg|_{-1,1},
4(\tf(-1,1)-\tf(-1,1/2))
\leq 
2\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1 }\bigg|_{-1,1/2} 
\leq \frac{\partial^2 (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1 \partial t_2}\bigg|_{-1,1/2}
\]
\end{lemma}
We handle the proof piecewise, splitting into 2 cases, $0<a\leq \pi^2$ and $\pi^2<a\leq21$ depending on which formulas we use for $\tfo$ and $\tft$.

First, we show
\begin{lemma}
\label{derivcomp}
\[
\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{(-1,1)}\geq \frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_2}\bigg|_{(-1,1)}
\]
\end{lemma}

The proof is contained in the appendix, using bounds also contained there. 

Now recall for this range of $a$ that
\[
b_1=\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_2}\bigg|_{-1,1}.
\]
We first show that this choice of $b_1$ ensures $(\tf-\tg)(-1,1/2)\geq0$:
\begin{lemma}
\label{bottominequality}
    For $a\geq 21$, $(\tf-\tg)(-1,1/2)\geq0$.
\end{lemma}
The proof is contained in the appendix using our bounds on $\theta$. 
Along with our selection of $b_1$, we can then apply Lemma $\ref{vertbdry}$ to conclude $\tf\geq \tg$ whenever $t_1=-1$ in $\td$. Similarly, the inequality $\tf\geq \tg$ for all points $(t_1,1)$ with $t_1\in [-1,1]$ is immediate from Lemma \ref{derivcomp}, our choice of $b_1$, and the convexity of the $\tf-\tg$ in $t_1$.\\


Next, we show that if $t_1\leq \cos(2\pi \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4})$, we have $\tf\geq \tg$ in $\td$, and in fact we'll show the stronger claim that $\tf\geq \tg$ in the region $[-1,\cos(2\pi \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4})]\times[1/2,1]$ (corresponding to rectangle A in Figure \ref{4ptproofstrat}). \\
To do so, we'll use that the log derivative of $\tth$ is strictly completely monotone (cf. Proposition \ref{logderivcm}. 
One consequence of this property is that if $H_{\tf}$ denotes the Hessian matrix of $\tf$, we have for all $t_1,t_2 \in [-1,1]$ that
\[
\det(H_{\tf}) <0.
\]
Indeed,
recalling the formulas,
\begin{align}
\label{tfformulaslargea}
f_1(x_1)= \sqrt{\frac{a}{\pi}}\theta(\frac{\pi}{a},x)=\sum^{\infty}_{k=-\infty} e^{-a(k+x)^2}\\
f_2(x_2)=\sqrt{\frac{3a}{\pi}}\theta(\frac{\pi}{3a},x)=\sum^{\infty}_{k=-\infty} e^{-3a(k+x)^2},
\end{align}
we obtain in the $A_2$ case,
\[
\tf(t_1,t_2)=\tfo(t_1)\tft(t_2)+\tfo(-t_1)\tft(-t_2).
\]

By Proposition \ref{logderivcm}, for $i\in\{1,2\}$,
\[
0> 
\left(\frac{\tilde{f}_i'}{\tilde{f}_i}\right)'
=
\frac{\tilde{f}_i''\tilde{f}_i
-(\tilde{f}_i')^2}{\tilde{f}_i^2}
\] 
and so 
\[
\tilde{f}_i''\tilde{f}_i < (\tilde{f}_i')^2
\]
Thus, we compute
\begin{align}
\det(H_{\tf}) &= \tfo(t_1)''\tft(t_2)\tft''(t_2)\tfo(t_1)-(\tfo'(t_1)\tft'(t_2))^2
+\\
&\tfo(-t_1)''\tft(-t_2)\tft''(-t_2)\tfo(-t_1)-(\tfo'(-t_1)\tft'(-t_2))^2\\
&=(\tfo''(t_1) \tfo(t_1))(\tft''(t_2) \tft(t_2))-\tfo'(t_1)^2\tft'(t_2)^2
+
\\
&(\tfo''(-t_1) \tfo(-t_1))(\tft''(-t_2) \tft(-t_2))-\tfo'(-t_1)^2\tft'(-t_2)^2\\
&< 0
\end{align}
as desired. 

\begin{definition}
\label{linearizedg}
Fix $b,c \in [-1.1]$. Then we define 
\[
\tg_{b,c}:=\tg-b_1 t_1t_2+b_1(bt_2+ct_1-bc).
\]
\end{definition}
Note that if $t_1\geq b$, $t_2\leq c$, then
\[
(t_1-b)(t_2-c)\leq 0
\]
and so $t_1t_2\leq bt_2+ct_1-bc$. Thus, if $t_1\geq b$, $t_2\leq c$, then
$\tg \leq \tg_{b,c}$ with equality if $t_1=b$ or $t_2=c$.

The useful thing about $\tg_{b,c}$ for any choice of $b,c$ is that it satisfies 
\[
\det(H_{\tf-\tg_{b,c}})= \det(H_{\tf})-2b_1 \tfo''(t_1)\tft(t_2)< \det(H_{\tf})<0.
\]
Thus, to check $\tf\geq \tg_{a,b}$ on a rectangular region, it suffices to consider the boundary by the second derivative test. If that rectangular region is chosen such that $g_{b,c}\geq \tg$, then we have a means of showing $\tf\geq \tg$ without needing to consider a full 2-dimensional region.

\begin{lemma}
\label{4ptlinearization}
    For $t_1,t_2\in [-1,\cos(2\pi \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4})]\times [\frac12,1]$, $\tf\geq \tg$. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    First, we show the inequality for the rectangle $[-1,\cos(2\pi \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4})] \times [.7,1]$, As explained above, it suffices to prove that $\tf \geq \tg_{-1,1}$ on the boundary of the rectangle. Since $\tg_{-1,1}=\tg\leq \tf$ when $t_1=-1$ or $t_2=1$, it suffices to prove the inequality for the other two sides. \\
    There, we use our approximations of $\theta$ and $b_1$ to provide a simple upper bound, call it $\tg_{-1,1}'$ for $\tg_{-1,1}$. The key feature of this upper bound is that $e^{a/4}\tg_{-1,1}'$ is linear in $a$. Meanwhile, as a lower bound for $\tf$, we use the function
\[
\tf_T:=(e^{-ax^2}+e^{-a(x-1)^2})e^{-3a u^2}+ e^{-a((\frac12-x)^2+3(\frac12-u)^2)}
\]
where
\[
x=\frac{\arccos(t_1)}{2\pi}, \hspace{.5 cm} u=\frac{\arccos(t_2)}{2\pi}.
\]
We know $\tf_T\leq \tf$ because we have simply truncated positive terms from the formulas for $f_1$ and $f_2$ to obtain $\tf_T$. It's also straightforward to see that at any point, $e^{a/4}\tf_T$ is convex in $a$.  
Thus, the difference $e^{a/4}(\tf_T- \tg_{-1,1}')$ is convex in $a$, and so to show that $\tf_T\geq \tg_{-1,1}$ at some $t_1',t_2'$ for all $a\geq 21$, it suffices to show $\tf_T(t_1',t_2')\geq \tg_{-1,1}'(t_1',t_2')$ when $a=21$ and also that  
\[
\frac{\partial \left[e^{a/4}(\tf_T- \tg_{-1,1}')\right]}{\partial a}\bigg|_{a=21,t_1=t_1',t_2=t_2'}\geq 0.
\]
These computations are carried out in the appendix. \\
For the remaining region $[-1,\cos(2\pi \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4})] \times [.5,.7]$, we carry out the same procedure with $\tg_{-1,.7}$ functioning as our upper bound for $\tg$ when $t_2\in [.6,.7]$ and  $\tg_{-1,.6}$ functioning as our upper bound when $t_2\in [.5,.6]$. For the former case, when $t_2=.7$ or $t_1=-1$, 
$\tg_{-1,.7}=\tg$, which we have just shown stays below $\tf$ on those segments. So it remains to show that the inequality holds on the sides where $t_1=\cos(2\pi \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4})$ and $t_2=.6$. Likewise, we only need to show the inequality $\tg_{-1,.6}\leq \tf_T$ when 
$t_1= \cos(2\pi \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4})$, $t_2\in[1/2,.6]$ and when $t_2=1/2$, $t_1\in [-1,\cos(2\pi \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4})]$.
These computations are carried out as in the previous case in the appendix.     
\end{proof}
Finally, we show that $\tf-\tg$ increases in $t_1$ for every point in $\td$ with $t_1\geq \cos(2\pi \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4})$.
\begin{lemma}
\label{largea4ptt1growth}
For all $a\geq 21$ and every $p=(t_1,t_2)\in \td$ with $t_1\geq  \cos(2\pi \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4})$, $\frac{\partial( \tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_p\geq 0$. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
Because of the convexity of the difference in $t_1$ and Lemma \ref{3rdorderpartial}, it suffices to show that at $P=( \cos(2\pi \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}), \cos(2\pi \frac{\sqrt{3}}{12})):=(t_1',t_2')$,
\[
\frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{P}\geq 0, \hspace{1 cm} \frac{\partial^2 (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1 \partial t_2}\bigg|_{P}\geq 0
\]
which is handled in the appendix. 
\end{proof}

% 6 POINT UNIVERSAL OPTIMALITY
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Universal Optimality of $\omega^*_6$}
\label{section6}

We consider the $m=1$ case of the interpolation problem from Section~\ref{6ptInProb}.
In this case we have interpolation conditions at the nodes $\tilde{\tau}_{6}=\{(-1,-1),(1,-\frac12),(-1,\frac12) \}$.  Using the same rescaling convention as in the previous section, we have
$$\tf(t_1,t_2)=\tfo(t_1)\tft(t_2),$$ where $\tfo,\tft$ are as in \eqref{f1f2Def}. For $m=1$, we 
  may choose an interpolant $\tg=\tg_a\in \mathcal{P}_1(t_1)\times \mathcal{P}_2(t_2)$; i.e $\tg$ of the form
 $$
\tg(t_1,t_2)=\sum_{i=0}^1\sum_{j=0}^2b_{i,j}t_1^it_2^j.
$$  We   require that $\tg$ and $\tf$ agree at the three points in $\tilde{\tau}_{6}$ and remark that the condition $\tg \leq \tf$ further requires  
 $\partial\tg/\partial t_2=\partial\tf/\partial t_2$ at the points $(-1,1/2)$ and $(1,-1/2)$ giving a total of 5 linearly independent conditions on $\mathcal{P}_1(t_1)\times \mathcal{P}_2(t_2)$.  

% Figure environment removed

 
Noting that $q(t_1,t_2)=(1+t_1)(t_2+1/2)^2$ vanishes on $\tilde{\tau}_{6}$ and that $\frac{\partial q}{\partial t_2}$ vanishes  on $\{(-1,1/2),(1,-1/2)\}$ shows that $\tg$ can be written as
\begin{equation}\label{tgH}
\begin{split}
  \tg(t_1,t_2)&=\frac{(1-t_1)}{2}\tfo(-1) H_{\{-1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\}}(\tft)(t_2)+ \frac{(1+t_1)}{2}\tfo(1) H_{\{-\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2}\}}(\tft)(t_2) + c q(t_1,t_2),    
\end{split}
\end{equation}
where $H_T(f)$ is the Hermite interpolant to $f$ on the node set $T$ which can be expressed in terms of divided differences (see Appendix~\ref{DivDiffSec}).   In particular, 
 $$
 H_{\{-1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}\}}(\tft)(t_2)=
 \tft(-1)+\tft[-1,\frac{1}{2}](t_2+1)+\tft[-1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}](t_2+1)(t_2-\frac{1}{2}),
 $$
and $H_{\{-\frac{1}{2},-\frac{1}{2}\}}(\tft)(t_2)=\tft(-\frac{1}{2})+\tft'(-\frac{1}{2})(t_2+\frac{1}{2})^2$.
Since $T_1(t)=t$ and $T_2(t)=2t^2-1$, it easily follows that $\tg$ is PSD if and only if $b_{i,j}\ge 0$ for $(i,j)\neq0$. From \eqref{tgH}, it follows that
$b_{1,2}=-\frac{1}{2}\tfo(-1)\tft[-1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}]+c$.  Observing that $q\ge 0$ on $[-1,1]^2$, we choose $c=\frac{1}{2}\tfo(-1)\tft[-1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}]$   as small as possible in which case $b_{1,2}=0$.

In addition,  the following derivative equality,   
\begin{equation}
\label{derivative equality}
\tfo(-1)\tft'(-1/2)=\tfo(1)\tft'(1/2).
\end{equation}
proved in \cite{Baernstein_1997} (also see  \cite{Su_2015}) implies that $b_{1,1}=b_{0,2}$. Hence we may   express $\tg$ in the form 
\begin{equation}
\tg(t_1,t_2) = 
    a_{0,0}+a_{1,0}t_1 +a_{0,1}t_2+ a_{0,2}(t_1t_2+t^{2}_2+1/4),
\end{equation}
where $a_{0,0}=b_{0,0}-b_{0,2}/4$ and $a_{i,j}=b_{i,j}$ otherwise. 

From \eqref{tgH}, we then  compute
\begin{align}
a_{0,1}&=\tfo(-1)\tft'(-1/2)\\
a_{0,0}&=\frac{\tfo(1)\tft(-1/2)+\tfo(-1)\tft(1/2)}{2} \\
a_{1,0}&=\frac{\tfo(1)\tft(-1/2)-\tfo(-1)\tft(1/2)}{2}+\frac{a_{0,1}}{2}\\
a_{0,2}&=\tfo(-1)\tft[-1,\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2}]=\frac49(\tfo(-1)\tft(-1)+a_{0,1}+a_{1,0}-a_{0,0}).
\end{align}



\subsection{Verifying properties of $\tg$}


It remains to verify that the $a_{i,j}$'s are nonnegative  and $\tg\leq \tf$.


\begin{lemma}
\label{leftboundary}
$\tf(-1,t_2)\geq \tg(-1,t_2)$ for all $ t_2\in[-1, 1]$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Note that $\tf(-1,t_2)=\tfo(-1)\tft(t_2)$ is strictly absolutely monotone as a function of $t_2$ on [-1,1] and so the inequality follows from  the error formula \eqref{ErrForm} with strict inequality if $t_2\neq -1,1/2$.
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
\label{nonnegcoeff}
$a_{0,0}, a_{1,0},a_{0,1},a_{0,2}\geq 0.$
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
That $a_{0,1}$, $a_{0,0}$, $a_{0,2}$ are nonnegative follows immediately from the absolute monotonicity of $\tfo$ and $\tft$. 

Finally, by lemma \ref{leftboundary}, $\tg(-1,-1/2)< \tf(-1,-1/2)$. Moreover, by definition, $\tg(1,-1/2)=\tf(1,-1/2)$. Since $(\tf-\tg)(t_1,-1/2)$ is convex in $t_1$, we must have 
\[
a_{1,0}-\frac12 a_{0,2}=\frac{\partial \tg}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,-1/2}\geq \frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,-1/2}>0.
\]
So $a_{1,0}-\frac12a_{0,2}>0$ which implies $a_{1,0}>0$ since we have already established $a_{0,2}\geq 0$. 
\end{proof}
 Thus, $\tg$ has a nonnegative Chebyshev expansion as desired.

\subsection{Necessary Conditions Fulfilled and $\tf\geq \tg$ when $\vert t_2\vert\in [1/2,1]$}
Finally, we must show $\tg\leq \tf$ on $[-1,1]^2$, which is by far our most technical task. Our equality conditions on $\tg$ yield  necessary inequality conditions (for $\tg \leq \tf$) on the derivatives of $\tg$.
First, we have the necessary conditions 
\begin{align}
    \label{necescondit1}
\frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,-1}\geq 0\\
    \label{necescondit2}
    \frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,\frac12} \geq 0
\end{align}
Likewise, we have 
\begin{align}
    \label{necescondit3}
     \frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{1,-\frac12}\leq 0
\end{align}
each of which we show is satisfied in the appendix.
These necessary conditions are actually sufficient to obtain $\tf \geq \tg$ when 
$\vert t_2\vert\in [1/2,1]$
without any more calculations.
\begin{proposition}
\label{horizslices1/2}
If $\frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_{1}}\bigg|_{(-1,t'_2)}\geq0$ and $\tfo(-1)\tft(t'_2)\geq \tg(-1,t'_2)$ for some $t'_2\in [-1,1]$, then
\[
\tfo(t_1)\tft(t'_2)\geq \tg(t_1,t'_2)
\]
for all $t_1\in [-1,1]$
with strict inequality if $t_1\neq -1$.
The same inequality holds if $\frac{\partial (\tfo\tft-\tg)}{\partial t_{1}}\bigg|_{(1,t_2)}\leq0$
and $\tfo(1)\tft(t_2)\geq\tg(1,t_2)$, with strict inequality if $t_1\neq 1$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Note that for fixed $t_2$, $\tg(t_1,t_2)$ is linear in $t_1$. Thus by the absolute monotonicity of $\tfo$, $\tf-\tg$ is convex in $t_1$. It follows that if $\frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_{1}}\bigg|_{(-1,t'_2)}\geq 0$ and $\tfo(-1)\tft(t'_2)=\tg(-1,t'_2)$, then 
\[
\tfo(t_1)\tft(t'_2)\geq \tg(t_1,t'_2)
\]
for all $t_1\in [-1,1]$ with strict inequality for $t_1>-1$. 
Again invoking the convexity of $\tf-\tg$ in $t_1$, we obtain the same conclusion if 
$\frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_{1}}\bigg|_{(1,t'_2)}\leq0$
and $\tfo(1)\tft(t'_2)\geq \tg(1,t_2)$ with strict inequality if $t_1\neq 1$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{t2>1/2}
$\tf(t_1,t_2)\geq \tg(t_1,t_2)$ in $\ts$ whenever $t_2\geq 1/2$, with equality only at $(-1,1/2)$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
From our necessary conditions, we have 
\[
%\frac{\partial(\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,-1}\geq 0, \hspace{.5 cm}
\frac{\partial(\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,1/2}\geq 0, \hspace{.5 cm}\frac{\partial(\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{1,-1/2}\leq 0. 
\]
Since $\frac{\partial(\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{t_1,-1/2}$ is increasing in $t_1$,  $\frac{\partial(\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{1,-1/2}\leq 0$ implies 
%$\displaystyle{\frac{\partial(\%tf-\tg)}{\partial %t_1}\bigg|_{-1,-1/2}\leq 0}$. 
$\frac{\partial(\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,-1/2}\leq 0$.
We also know that $\frac{\partial(\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,t_2}$ is convex in $t_2$ by the absolute monotonicity of $\tfo$ and $\tft$, from which we obtain $\frac{\partial(\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,t_2}\geq 0$ for all $t_2\geq 1/2$. Indeed, fixing $t_1=-1$, we can bound $\frac{\partial(\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}$ below for $t_2\geq 1/2$ by its tangent approximation, which is positive at $t_2=1/2$ and has positive slope since the average slope from $t_2=-1/2$ to $t_2=1/2$ is positive. Finally, lemma \ref{leftboundary} yields $\tf(-1,t_2)\geq \tg(-1,t_2)$ for all $t_2\in [1/2,1]$. Combining these two facts, we invoke lemma \ref{horizslices1/2} to assert $\tf-\tg\geq 0$ whenever $t_2\geq 1/2$. 
\end{proof}

Next, we have $\tf\geq \tg$ when $t_1=1$.  
\begin{proposition}
\label{rightboundary}
$\tfo(1)\tfo(t_2)\geq \tg(1,t_2)$ for all $t_2 \in [-1,1]$ with equality only at $t_2=-1,1/2$.
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
Suppose by way of contradiction that there exists $t_2'\in [-1,1]$ such that $t_2'\neq -\frac12$ and $\tfo(1)\tft(t_2') \leq \tg(1,t_2')$. Then there must be some point $-1/2\neq p\in[-1,1]$ such that $\tfo(1)\tft(p) \leq \tg(1,p)$. Indeed, either $t_2'$ is such a point, or $\tfo(1)\tft(t_2') < \tg(1,t_2')$. We have from our necessary derivative conditions and lemma \ref{t2>1/2} that $\tfo(1)\tft(\pm 1)> \tg(1,\pm 1)$, which yield two cases for $t_2'$. If $t_2'<-1/2$, then 
%by the intermediate value theorem applied to $t_2=t_2',-1$, 
there exists $p \in (-1,t_2')$ such that $\tfo(1)\tft(p)= \tg(1,p)$ by the intermediate value theorem. If $t_2'>-1/2$, instead apply the intermediate value theorem to $t_2=t_2',1$ to get our desired $p\in[1/2,1]$.\\
Similarly to the proof that $\tf\geq \tg$ for $t_2=-1$, $\tg(1,t_2)$ is a polynomial of degree at most 2, and interpolates $\tfo(1)\tfo(t_2)$ for $T=\{p,-1/2,-1/2\}$. By the uniqueness of hermite interpolants, $\tg$ satisfies the error formula, that is, 
\[
\tfo(1)\tft(t_2)-\tg(1,t_2)=\tfo(1)\tft^{(3)}(\xi) (t_2-p)(t_2+1/2)^2
\]
for some $\xi\in[-1,1]$ .
By absolute monotonicity of $\tft$, $\tfo(1)\tft^{(3)}(\xi)\geq 0$. But for $t_2=-1$, $(t_2-p)(t_2+1/2)^2< 0$, implying 
$\tfo(1)\tft(-1)<\tg(1,-1)$ a contradiction. We conclude $\tfo(1)\tfo(t_2)\geq \tg(1,t_2)$ for all $t_2 \in [-1,1]$ as desired.  
\end{proof}

\begin{proposition}
For all $(t_1,t_2)\in [-1,1]\times [-1,-1/2]$
$\tfo(t_1)\tfo(t_2)\geq \tg(t_1,t_2)$.
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
From lemma \ref{leftboundary}, we have $\tf\geq \tg$ for $t_1=-1$. By the necessary derivative conditions and lemma \ref{horizslices1/2}, we have the same inequality when $t_2=-1/2,-1$. Finally, by lemma \ref{rightboundary}, we have the inequality for $t_1=1$. All of these inequalities are strict in $[-1,1]\times [-1,1/2]$ except for at $(-1,-1)$ and $(1,-1/2)$.
Thus, it remains to show the inequality on the interior. For an 
arbitrary point $p=(p_1,p_2)$ on the interior, the line $l$ through $p$ and $(1,-1/2)$ has positive slope. Let its direction vector in the positive $t_1$ direction be $u_l$. 
%We may assume that $p$ is not on the line from $(-1,1)$ to $(1,-1/2)$ and then extend the result to these points by continuity once we have proved $\tf\geq \tg$ elsewhere. 
\\
Let $\tf^l(r)$ and $\tg^l$ be the one-variable functions obtained by parametrizing $\tf$ and $\tg$ along $l$ with constant speed so that $\tf^l(1)=\tf(1,-1/2)$ and $\tf^l(0)=\tf(p')$ for some $p'$ on the boundary of $[-1,1]\times[-1,1/2]$ where $t_1=-1$ or $t_2=-1$ . Since $l$ has positive slope, and $\tfo$, $\tft$ are both strictly absolutely monotone, $\tf^l$ is also strictly absolutely monotone on $[0,1]$. Likewise, $\tg^l$ is a polynomial of total degree at most 2 since
$ \tg$ is a polynomial of total degree 2.\\
We know for all $\epsilon>0$ sufficiently small that $(\tf^l-\tg^l)(\epsilon)>0$. Indeed, if $l$ does not go through $(-1,-1)$, then 
$(\tf^l-\tg^l)(0)>0$ and the result follows by continuity, and if $l$ does go through $(-1,1)$, then we can use the necessary derivative conditions to see 
\[
\nabla (\tf-\tg)\bigg|_{-1,-1} \cdot u_l> 0,
\]
from which the inequality holds for all desired $\epsilon$.
Similarly, the necessary derivative inequality and equality conditions at $(1,-1/2)$ imply
$\nabla (\tf-\tg)\bigg|_{-1,1/2} \cdot u_l< 0$. Together with the fact that $(\tf^l-\tg^l)(1)=0$, we get
$(\tf^l-\tg^l)(1-\epsilon)>0$ for all $\epsilon$ sufficiently small. 
\\
Now supposing for a contradiction that $\tf^L(r')<0$ for some $r'\in [0,1]$, we apply the intermediate value theorem twice to get some points $0<r_1<r'<r_2<1$ such that 
$(\tf^l-\tg^l)(r_1)=(\tf^l-\tg^l)(r_2)=0$. But now as with the previous lemmas, $\tg^l$ is a polynomial of degree at most 2 which interpolates $\tf^l$ for $T={r_1,r_2,1}$, leading to a contradiction with the error formula 
applied at $0$ to $\tf^l-\tg^l$.  We conclude that $\tf^l\geq \tg^l$ on $[0,1]$ as desired, and in fact, a similar argument shows we have strict inequality on $(0,1)$. 
\end{proof}
 
Thus, we have proved $\tf \geq \tg$ on $[-1,1]^2$ whenever $t_2\geq 1/2$ or $t_2 \leq -1/2$. Our proof of the inequality when $-1/2 \leq t_2\leq 1/2$, our so-called `critical region,' requires much more calculation.  

\subsection{The critical region for small $a$ ($a<\pi^2$)}
For $a<\pi^2$, we take a linear approximation approach. Recall that for fixed $t_2'$, $(\tf-\tg)(t_1,t_2')$ is convex in $t_1$. Thus, for $-1 \leq t_1'\leq 0$, 
\[
(\tf-\tg)(t_1',t_2')\geq (\tf-\tg)(-1,t_2')+ (t_1+1)\frac{\partial\tf -\tg}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,t_2'}=\tf(-1,t_2')+(t+1)\frac{\partial\tf }{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,t_2'}-\tg(t_1',t_2')
\]
since $\tg$ is linear in $t_1$. Since we already have $(\tf-\tg)(-1,t_2')\geq 0$, then if $(\tf-\tg)(-1,t_2')+ (t_1+1)\frac{\partial\tf -\tg}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,t_2'}\geq 0$ for $t_1=0$, also $(\tf-\tg)(-1,t_2')+ (t_1+1)\frac{\partial\tf -\tg}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,t_2'}$ for all $t_1\leq 0$. 
Thus, to show $(\tf-\tg)(t_1',t_2')\geq 0$ for all $t_1'\leq 0, \frac{-1}{2}\leq t_2 \leq \frac{1}{2}$, we need only show for all $t_2\in [\frac{-1}{2},\frac12]$ that
\[
(\tf-\tg)(-1,t_2')+ \frac{\partial\tf -\tg}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,t_2'}=\tf(-1,t_2')+\frac{\partial\tf }{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,t_2'}-\tg(0,t_2')\geq 0.
\]
Likewise, when $0\leq t_1'\leq 1$, 
\[
(\tf-\tg)(t_1',t_2')\geq (\tf-\tg)(1,t_2')+ (t_1-1)\frac{\partial\tf -\tg}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,t_2'}=\tf(1,t_2')+(t_1-1)\frac{\partial\tf }{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{1,t_2'}-\tg(t_1',t_2').
\]
Since we already have $(\tf-\tg)(1,t_2')\geq 0$, then if $(\tf-\tg)(1,t_2')+ (t_1-1)\frac{\partial\tf -\tg}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,t_2'}\geq 0$ for $t_1=0$, also $(\tf-\tg)(-1,t_2')+ (t_1-1)\frac{\partial\tf -\tg}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,t_2'}$ for all $t_1\geq 0$.
Thus, to show $(\tf-\tg)(t_1',t_2')\geq 0$ for all $t_1'\geq 0, \frac{-1}{2}\leq t_2 \leq \frac{1}{2}$, we need only show for all $t_2\in [\frac{-1}{2},\frac12]$ that
\[
(\tf-\tg)(1,t_2')+ \frac{\partial\tf -\tg}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{1,t_2'}=\tf(1,t_2')-\frac{\partial\tf }{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{1,t_2'}-\tg(0,t_2')\geq 0.
\]
Now we claim for all $t_2'$ that 
\[
\label{linapproxs}
\tf(-1,t_2')+\frac{\partial\tf }{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,t_2'}-\tg(0,t_2')\geq \tf(1,t_2')+\frac{\partial\tf }{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{1,t_2'}-\tg(0,t_2'),
\]
which would imply that showing $\tf(1,t_2')+\frac{\partial\tf }{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{1,t_2'}-\tg(0,t_2')\geq0$ suffices to prove $\tf\geq \tg$ in the entire critical region. 
Now \ref{linapproxs} holds because $\tf(-1,t_2')+\frac{\partial\tf }{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,t_2'}$ and $\tf(1,t_2')+\frac{\partial\tf }{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{1,t_2'}-\tg(0,t_2')$ are both tangent approximations of $\tf(0,t_2')$ from $t_1=-1,1$ respectively. Using the Lagrange Remainder of the Taylor Polynomial, we have 
\[
\tf(-1,t_2')+\frac{\partial\tf }{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,t_2'}= \tf(0,t_2')-\frac{\tfo''(\chi_1)}{2!}\geq \tf(0,t_2')-\frac{\tfo''(\chi_2)}{2!} =\tf(1,t_2')+\frac{\partial\tf }{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{1,t_2'}
\]
where $\xi_1\in[-1,0],\xi_2\in[0,1]$ and using absolute monotonicity of $\tfo$. 
\subsubsection{Proving the Linear Approximation Bound}
So it suffices to show $\phi(t_2):=\tf(1,t_2)-\frac{\partial\tf }{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{1,t_2}-\tg(0,t_2)\geq 0$ for all $t_2\in[-1/2,1/2]$. We can express $\phi$ as 
\[
\phi(t_2)=(\tfo(1)-\tfo'(1))\tft(t_2)-b_{0,0}-b_{0,1}t_2-b_{0,2}t_{2}^2.
\]
Using our technical bounds on $\tth$, we show in the appendix that for $a<\pi^2$, we have:
\begin{lemma}
$\tfo(1)-\tfo'(1)\geq 0$.
\end{lemma}
Thus, $\phi^{(3)} \geq 0$, and so the 2nd degree Taylor polynomial at $t_2=-\frac{1}{2}$ yields a lower bound on $\phi$ for $t_2\geq -1/2$:
\[
\phi(t_2)\geq A+B(t_2+1/2)+\frac{C}{2}(t_2+1/2)^2
\]
where 
\begin{align}
    A=\phi(-1/2)&=\left(\tfo(1)-\tfo'(1)\right)\tft(-1/2)-b_{0,0}+\frac{b_{0,1}}{2}-\frac{b_{0,2}}{4}\\
    &=\left(\tfo(1)-\tfo'(1)\right)\tft(-1/2)-a_{0,0}+\frac{b_{0,1}}{2}-\frac{b_{0,2}}{2}\\
    &= \left(\frac12\tfo(1)-\tfo'(1)\right)\tft(-1/2)+\frac16\tfo(-1)\tft'(1/2)-\tfo(-1)\left(\frac29 \tft(-1)+\frac{5}{18}\tft(1/2)\right)\\
    B=\phi'(-1/2)&=(\tfo(1)-\tfo'(1))\tft'(-1/2)-b_{0,1}+b_{0,2}\\
    &=b_{0,2}-\tfo'(1)\tft'(-1/2)\\
    &=\frac49 \tfo(-1)\left(\tft(-1)-\tft(1/2)+\frac32 \tft'(1/2)\right)-\tfo'(1)\tft'(1/2)\\
    C=\phi''(-1/2)&=\left(\tfo(1)-\tfo'(1)\right)\tft''(-1/2)-2b_{0,2}\\
    &=\left(\tfo(1)-\tfo'(1)\right)\tft''(-1/2)-\frac89\tfo(-1)\left(\tft(-1)-\tft(1/2)+\frac32 \tft'(1/2)\right).
\end{align}
With these representations, we'll produce lower bounds on $A$ and $C$ that show $A,C>0$. So then it suffices to show that the quadratic has no zeroes, i.e. if $B^2-2AC<0$. Moreover, if $B>0$, there's nothing to show (as $\phi$ would definitely be positive), so to bound $B^2$ above, we can bound $B$ below and then square that bound. Thus, an upper bound on $B^2-2AC$ is obtained by using our lower bound for $B$ and lower bounds for $A,C$, and we show this upper bound for $B^2-2AC$ is negative, completing the proof when $a< \pi^2$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{The critical region for $a\geq 9.6$}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Figure environment removed
The inequality $\tf \geq \tg$ for Regions A,B,C,D, and E from figure  \ref{proofstrategy6} is handled in lemmas \ref{linearization1}, \ref{t1deriv}, \ref{gradientcomp}, \ref{linearization2}, and \ref{logderivlemma}, respectively. 
We begin by showing $\tf\leq \tg$ using the same linearization approach as in the large $a$ case of the 4-point problem. 
Similarly as before, we define for $b,c\in [-1,1]$
\[
\tg_{b,c}:=\tg-b_{0,2}t_1t_2+b_{0,2}(bt_2+ct_2-bc),
\]
with the important resulting property that 
$\det(H_{\tf-\tg_{b,c}})<0$ everywhere. 
\begin{lemma}
\label{linearization1}
For all $(t_1,t_2)$ such that $-1\leq t_1 \leq -\sqrt{2}/2$, $0\leq t_2\leq \frac12$, $\tf \geq \tg$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
First, we show the inequality for $t_1\leq -\sqrt{2}/2$, $\frac14\leq t_2 \leq \frac12$. In this region, we have
 $\tg_{-1,.5}\geq \tg$ with equality when $t_2=1/2$ or $t_1=-1$. As in the 4-point case, it suffices to show that $\tg_{-1,.5} \leq \tf$ on the region, and it further suffices to show this inequality holds on the boundary.\\
For the sections of the boundary where $t_1=-1$, or $t_2=1/2$, we have $\tg_{-1,1/2}=\tg$ and so $\tg \leq \tf$ by lemmas \ref{leftboundary} and \ref{horizslices1/2}. For the other two sections of the boundary, $t_1=-\sqrt{2}/2$ and $t_2=\frac14$, we proceed analogously to the 4-point case. Using approximations of the $a_{i,j}$ coefficients (listed in the appendix) yields a relatively simple upper bound, again call it $\tg_{-1,1/2}'$ for $\tg_{-1,1/2}$, which is linear in $a$, up to a factor of $e^{-a/3}$. As a lower bound for $\tf$, we use the similar function
\[
\tf_T:=(e^{-ax^2}+e^{-a(x-1)^2})e^{-3a u^2}
\]
where as usual
\[
x=\frac{\arccos(t_1)}{2\pi}, \hspace{.5 cm} u=\frac{\arccos(t_2)}{2\pi}.
\]
and as before, $e^{a/3}\tf_T$ is convex in $a$. making the difference $e^{a/3}(\tf_T- \tg_{-1,1/2}')$ convex in $a$. So it suffices to show $\tf_T(t_1',t_2')\geq \tg_{t_1',t_2'}$ when $a=9.6$ and also that  
\[
\frac{\partial \left[e^{a/3}(\tf_T- \tg_{-1,1/2}')\right]}{\partial a}\bigg|_{a=9.6,t_1=t_1',t_2=t_2'}\geq 0.
\]
In the appendix, we carry out these two calculations in a computer assisted manner for the boundary portions  $\{(-\sqrt{2}/2,t_2)\mid \frac14\leq t_2 \leq \frac12\}$ and
$\{(t_1,\frac14)\mid -1\leq t_1 \leq -\sqrt{2}/2\}$, which complete the proof that $\tf \geq \tg$ for $(t_1,t_2)\in [-1,-\sqrt{2}/2]\times[\frac14,\frac12]$.
\\

To obtain $\tf \geq \tg$ for $(t_1,t_2)\in [-1,-\sqrt{2}/2]\times[0,\frac14]$, we conduct the same procedure with $\tg_{-1,\frac14}$ instead of $\tg_{-1,\frac12}$.
 Two sections of the boundary are immediate: when $t_1=-1$ or $t_2=\frac14$, $\tg=\tg_{-1,\frac14}$, and we have just established $\tf\geq \tg$ on those segments. The remaining two segments of the boundary are handled exactly as in the first section of the proof in the appendix.
\end{proof}


\begin{lemma}
\label{t1deriv}
For all $(t_1,t_2)$ such that $ -\sqrt{2}/2\leq t_1\leq 1$ and $0\leq t_2 \leq \frac12$, $\tf \geq \tg$. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
By the convexity of $\tf-\tg$ in $t_1$, it satisfies to show the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\tf(-\sqrt{2}/2,t_2)\geq \tg(-\sqrt{2}/2,t_2)$ for all $t_2\in [0,1/2]$
    \item $\frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-\sqrt{2}/2,t_2}\geq 0$ for $t_2\in[0,1/2]$.
\end{enumerate}
The first of these follows from lemma \ref{linearization1}. To prove the second, it actually suffices to just show that $\frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-\sqrt{2}/2,0}\geq 0$, which is handled in the appendix. This sufficiency is because $\frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\geq 0$ is convex in $t_2$ and satisfies $\frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-\sqrt{2}/2,-1/2}< 0$ (due to the necessary condition $\frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{1,-1/2}< 0$). 
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{gradientcomp}
For all $(t_1,t_2)$ such that $t_1\geq 0$ and $t_2\leq 0$, $\tf \geq \tg$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We claim that for this portion of the critical region, it suffices to show at each point that 
\[
L_1(t_1,t_2):=\frac{\tft'\tfo}{\tfo'\tft}-\frac{\frac{\partial \tg}{\partial t_2}}{\frac{\partial \tg}{\partial t_1}}> 0.
\]
Indeed, this would imply that $\tg$ increases along the level curves of $\tf$ as $t_1$ increases. First, we note that if we take a point $(t_1',t_2')$ on the boundary of the region where $t_2=-\frac12$ or $t_1=1$, then by the implicit function theorem, the equation $\tf=\tfo(t_1')\tft(t_2')$ implicitly defines a function $t_2=p(t_1)$ with negative slope from $(t_1',t_2')$ to a point on the portion of the boundary with $t_1=0$ or $t_2=0$. At any point on the curve, the vector $[\frac{\tft'}{\tft},-\frac{\tfo'}{\tfo}]^T$ is parallel and in the positive $t_1$ direction of $p$, so $\tg$ increases along $p$ if 
\[
\frac{\tft'}{\tft}\frac{\partial \tg}{\partial t_1}-\frac{\partial \tg}{\partial t_2}\frac{\tfo'}{\tfo}> 0
\]
as needed. Thus, if the previous inequality holds, then $\tf-\tg$ is minimized along the right and bottom boundaries of the region, where we have already showed it to be nonnegative in the previous section. We show $L_1(t_1,t_2)>0$ in the appendix. 
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{linearization2}
For all $(t_1,t_2)$ such that $-\sqrt{2}/2 \leq t_1 \leq 0$, $-\frac15 \leq t_2\leq 0$, $\tf \geq \tg$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
The proceeds very similarly to that of lemma \ref{linearization1}. We use $\tf_T$ in the same fashion, and when $-\sqrt{2}/2 \leq t_1 \leq 0$ and $-.1 \leq t_2\leq 0$, we use $\tg_{-\sqrt{2}/2,0}$. For 
$-\sqrt{2}/2 \leq t_1 \leq 0$ and $-.2 \leq t_2\leq -.1$, we use $\tg_{-\sqrt{2}/2,.1}$
The precise calculations are carried out in the appendix. 
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{logderivlemma}
For all $(t_1,t_2)$ such that $t_1\leq 0$ and $t_2\leq -.2$, $\tf \geq \tg$. Similarly, for all $(t_1,t_2)$ such that $t_1\leq -\sqrt{2}/2$ and $t_2\leq 0$, $\tf \geq \tg$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $S$ be the set described in the lemma set. Fix $-.5 \leq t_2'\leq 0$. We need to show $\tf\geq \tg$ on $S_{t_2'}:=\{t_1\mid (t_1,t_2') \in S \text{ and } g(t_1,t_2')\geq \tf(-1,t_2')\}$. Since $\tg$ is increasing in $t_1$ for $t_2\geq -1/2$, we have $S_{t_2'}$ is a closed interval. Either $S_{t_2'}$ is empty and there's nothing to show, or we have $\tf-\tg\geq 0$ at the right endpoint from our previous lemmas, namely \ref{gradientcomp} and \ref{linearization2}. Equivalently, at this right endpoint,
\[
0\leq \log(\frac{\tf}{\tg})=\log(\tfo)+\log(\tft)-\log(\tg).
\]
Thus, to prove $\tf\geq \tg$ for all $t_1\in S_{t_2'}$, it suffices to show 
\[
\frac{\partial \log(\frac{\tf}{\tg})}{\partial t_1}= \frac{\tfo'}{\tfo}-\frac{\frac{\partial \tg}{\partial t_1}}{\tg}\leq 0
\]
throughout $S$. 
Now $\frac{\tfo'}{\tfo}-\frac{\frac{\partial \tg}{\partial t_1}}{\tg}\leq 0$ is equivalent to 
\[
\frac{\tfo}{\tfo'}-\frac{\tg}{\frac{\partial \tg}{\partial t_1}}=\frac{\tfo}{\tfo'}-t_1-\frac{\tg(0,t_2)}{a_{1,0}+a_{0,2}t_2}\geq 0,
\]
since each of $\tfo,\tfo', \tg,\frac{\partial \tg}{\partial t_1}\geq 0.$ 
Notably, $\frac{\tfo}{\tfo'}-t_1$ is a function only in $t_1$, while $\frac{\tg(0,t_2)}{a_{1,0}+a_{0,2}t_2}$ depends only on $t_2$. Let 
\[
L_2(t_1,t_2):=\frac{\tfo}{\tfo'}-t_1-\frac{\tg(0,t_2)}{a_{1,0}+a_{0,2}t_2}.
\]
If we can show that $L_2$ is decreasing in $t_1$ and $t_2$, then to show $L_2\geq 0$ on all of $S$, we only need to show $L_2(-\sqrt{2}/2,0),L_2(0,-.2)\geq 0$, which we handle in the appendix.\\
So it remains to show $L_2$ is decreasing in both $t_1$ and $t_2$. 
\[
\frac{\partial L_2}{t_1}= (\frac{\tfo}{\tfo'})'-1=\frac{(\tfo')^2-\tfo''\tfo}{\tfo'^2}-1=1-\frac{\tfo''\tfo}{(\tfo')^2}-1<0
\]
as needed.
Similarly,
\[
\frac{\partial L_2}{t_2}=\frac{b_{0,0}b_{0,2}-b_{0,1}b_{1,0}-b_{0,2}t_2(2b_{1,0}+b_{0,2}t_2)}{(b_{1,0}+b_{0,2}t_2)^2}
\]
whose sign depends only on $N_2(t_2):=b_{0,0}b_{0,2}-b_{0,1}b_{1,0}-b_{0,2}t_2(2b_{1,0}+b_{0,2}t_2)$. Now 
\[
N_2'(t_2)=-2b_{0,2}(b_{1,0}+b_{0,2}t_2)=-2b_{0,2}\left(\frac{\partial \tg}{\partial t_1}\right)\leq 0
\]
for $t_2\geq \frac{-1}{2}$. So the negativity of $N_2(t_2)$ and (thus $\frac{\partial L_2}{t_2}$) follows from $N_2(-1/2)<0$, which we check in the appendix using our bounds on the $b_{i,j}$'s.

%\tg \leq \tg -a_{02}t_1t_2+a_{02}(-.1t_2 -.2t_1-.02).
%\]
%Let $\tg_{-.1,-.2}$ denote the right side of this inequality. As before, it suffices to show that $\tg_{-.1,-.2} \leq \tf$ on the region, and it further suffices to show the inequality holds on the boundary.
%We again bound $\tg_{-.1,-.2}$ above with $\tg^{'}_{-.1,-.2}$, where the coefficients $a_{i,j}$ are linear in $a$, up to a factor of $e^{-a/3}$. 
%Then we again have $e^{a/3}(\tf-\tg^{'}_{-.1,-.2})$ is convex in $a$. So to show $\tf-\tg_{-.1,-.2}\geq 0$ at some point for an arbitrary $a\geq 10$, it suffices to show $e^{a/3}(\tf-\tg^{'}_{-.1,-.2})\geq 0$ for $a=10$, with 
%\[
%\frac{\partial e^{a/3}(\tf-\tg^{'}_{-.1,-.2})}{\partial a}_\bigg|_{a=10} \geq 0.
%\]
%On each component of the boundary, these inequalities involve just one variable ($t_1$ or $t_2$), and so we carry these out in a computer assisted manner in the appendix.

\section{Divided differences and univariate  interpolation}\label{DivDiffSec}
We review some basic results concerning one-dimensional polynomial interpolation (e.g., see \cite[Section 5.6.2]{MEbook}).
Let $f\in C^m[a,b]$ for some $a,b$ be given along with some multiset
\[T=\{t_0,t_1,...,t_m\}\subseteq [a,b].
\]
 Then there then exists a unique polynomial $H_T(f)(t)$ of degree at most $m$ (called a {\em Hermite interpolant of $f$}) such that for each $\alpha\in T$, we have $H^{(\ell)}_T(f)(\alpha)=f^{(\ell)}(\alpha)$ for $0\leq \ell < k_\alpha$ where $k_\alpha$ denotes the multiplicity of $\alpha$ in $T$.  
Let $f[t_0,...,t_m]$  denote the coefficient of $t^m$ in $H_T(f)(t)$. This coefficient is called the $\textit{m-th divided difference}$ of $f$ for $T$. 
Then $H_T(f)$, may be expressed as
\[
H_T(f)(t)=\sum_{k=0}^{m}f[t_0,t_1,...,t_k]p_k(T;t)
\] where the {\em partial products} $p_k$ are defined  by
\[
p_0(T;t):=1 \text{ and } p_j(T;t):=\prod_{i<j}(t-t_i), \hspace{.2cm} j=1,2,...,m.
\]
Then a generalization of the mean value theorem  implies that there is some $\xi \in [a,b]$ such that 
\[
\frac{f^{(m)}(\xi)}{m!}=f[t_0,t_1,...,t_m].
\]


Putting these together, we arrive at the classical \textit{Hermite error formula}: 
\begin{equation}\label{ErrForm}
f(t)-H_T(f)(t)=f[t_0,t_1,...,t_m,t]\prod_{i=0}^{m}(t-t_i)=\frac{f^{(m+1)}(\xi)}{(m+1)!}\prod_{i=0}^{m}(t-t_i).    
\end{equation}
In the case that $f$ is absolutely monotone on $[a,b]$, such as with $\tfo$ and $\tft$, then the sign of $f(t)-H_T(f)(t)$   equals the sign of  $\prod^{m}_{i=0} (t-t_i)$. 

\section{Technical Estimates and Computations for $a<\pi^2$}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{$\theta$ estimates}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Recall that for $a<\pi^2$, we define 
$\tilde{f}_1(t_1)=\tth(\frac{\pi}{a };t_1)$ and
$\tilde{f}_2(t_2)=\tth(\frac{\pi}{3a };t_2)$. We then aim to find an interpolant for $\tfo(t_1)\tft(t_2)$ in the $L$ case and $\tfo(t_1)\tft(t_2)+\tfo(-t_1)\tft(-t_2)$ in the $A_2$ case.

For $0<a<\pi^2$, we will be using truncations of the formula 
\[
\theta(\frac{\pi}{a};x):=\sum^{\infty}_{k=-\infty} e^{-d k^2 }e^{2\pi i kx}=1+\sum_{k\geq 1} 2e^{-d k^2}\cos(2\pi kx).
\]
where $d:=\frac{\pi^2}{a}>1$, to obtain bounds on $\theta$. Thus, we will define
\begin{align}
\tfo(t_1,j)=\tfo(x_1,j)&:=1+\sum_{k= 1}^{j} 2e^{-d k^2}\cos(2\pi k x_1)\\
\tft(t_2,j)=f_2(\frac{x_2}{\sqrt{3}},j)&:=1+\sum_{k= 1}^{j} 2e^{\frac{-d k^2}{3}}\cos(\frac{2\pi k x_2}{\sqrt{3}})
\end{align}

Here are the relevant technical bounds on $\tfo$, $\tft$, and their derivatives. 
Let's first bound the tails of these series:
\begin{align}
    \left\lvert\sum_{k\geq 3} 2e^{-d k^2}\cos(2\pi kx) \right\rvert &\leq \sum_{k\geq 3} 2e^{-d k^2}\\
    &=2\sum_{k\geq 0} 2e^{-d (k+3)^2}\\
    &\leq 2e^{-4d}e^{-5}\sum_{k\geq 0}e^{-(k^2+6k)}\\
    &\leq 2e^{-4d}e^{-5}\sum_{k\geq 0}e^{-(7k)}\\
    &= e^{-4d}\frac{2}{e^5(1-e^{-7})}\leq \frac{e^{-4d}}{50}.
\end{align}
Similarly, we have 
\begin{align}
    \left\lvert\sum_{k\geq 5} 2e^{-d/3 k^2}\cos(2\pi kx) \right\rvert &\leq \sum_{k\geq 5} 2e^{-d/3 k^2}\\
    &=2\sum_{k\geq 0} 2e^{-d/3 (k+5)^2}\\
    &\leq 2e^{-16d/3}e^{-3}\sum_{k\geq 0}e^{-(k^2+10k)/3}\\
    &\leq 2e^{-16d/3}e^{-3}\sum_{k\geq 0}e^{-11k/3}\\
    &= e^{-16d/3}\frac{2}{e^3(1-e^{-11/3})}\leq \frac{e^{-16d/3}}{5}.
\end{align}
The following bounds on $\tfo$ and $\tft$ immediately follow:
\begin{proposition}
\label{6ptsmallthetavalbounds}
For any $t_1,t_2\in [-1,1]$, 
\begin{align}
   \tfo(t_1,2)-\frac{e^{-4d}}{50} &\leq \tfo(t_1)\leq \tfo(t_1,2)+\frac{e^{-4d}}{50}\\
   \tft(t_2,4)-\frac{e^{-16d/3}}{5}&\leq \tft(t_2)\leq \tft(t_2,4)+\frac{e^{-16d/3}}{5}
\end{align}
\end{proposition}
We also need bounds on the derivatives of $\tfo$ and $\tft$. With $x=\frac{\arccos(t)}{2\pi}$, then $\tilde{\theta}(c,t)=\theta(c,x)$, by the chain rule, we have 
\[
\frac{\partial \tth}{\partial t}=\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial x}\frac{\partial x}{\partial t}.
\]
So
\[
\frac{\partial \tth}{\partial t}(\frac{\pi}{a},t)=\left(-\sum_{k\geq 1} 2e^{-d k^2}(2\pi k)\sin (2\pi kx)\right)\frac{-1}{2\pi \sqrt{1-t^2}}=\frac{\sum_{k\geq 1} 2ke^{-d k^2}\sin (2\pi k x)}{\sin(2\pi x)}.
\]
For $t=\pm 1$ ($x=0,\frac12$), we need to use L'Hopital's rule. For example, when $t=1$, so $x=0$,
\[
\frac{\partial \tth}{\partial t}(\frac{\pi}{a },t)=\frac{\sum_{k\geq 1} 2ke^{-d k^2}(2\pi k)\cos (2\pi k x')}{(2\pi)\cos(2\pi x')}=\sum_{k\geq 1} 2k^2e^{-d k^2}
\]
and likewise, when $t=-1$
\[
\frac{\partial \tth}{\partial t}(\frac{\pi}{a },t)=\sum_{k\geq 1} (-1)^{n+1}2k^2e^{-d k^2}.
\]
Then we again bound the tails by comparison with geometric series. For example,
\begin{align}
\sum_{k\geq 3}2k^2 e^{-dk^2}&=\sum_{k\geq 0}2(k+3)^2 e^{-d(k+3)^2}\\
&=e^{-9d}2\sum_{k\geq 0}(k+3)^2 e^{-d(k^2+6k)}\\
&\leq e^{-4d}e^{-5} 2\sum_{k\geq 0}9e^{k}e^{-(k^2+6k)}\\
&\leq e^{-4d}18e^{-5}\sum_{k\geq0}e^{-6k}\\
&=\frac{18e^{-4d}}{e^{5}(1-e^{-6})}\\
&\leq \frac{e^{-4d}}{8}
\end{align}
To see this, we just used that $d>1$ and for all $k\geq 0$,
$(k+3)^2 \leq 9e^{k}$.
In the $d/3$ case, since $(k+6)^2\leq 36e^{k/3}$, we analogously have
\begin{align}
\sum_{k\geq 6}2k^2 e^{-d/3k^2}&=\sum_{k\geq 0}2(k+6)^2 e^{-d/3(k+6)^2}\\
&=e^{-25d/3}2e^{-11/3}\sum_{k\geq 0}(k+6)^2 e^{-d/3(k^2+12k)}\\
&\leq e^{-25d/3}2e^{-11/3}\sum_{k\geq 0}36e^{k/3} e^{-1/3(13k)}\\
&\leq e^{-25d/3}72e^{-11/3}\sum_{k\geq 0} e^{-4k}\\
&=e^{-25d/3}\frac{72}{e^{11/3}(1-e^{-4})}\\
&\leq 2e^{-25d/3}.
\end{align}
When $t=\pm \frac12$,
\[
\frac{\sum_{k>j} 2ke^{-d k^2}\sin (2\pi k x)}{\sin(2\pi x)}\leq 
\frac{\sum_{k>j} \left\lvert 2ke^{-d k^2}\sin (2\pi k x)\right\rvert }{\lvert \sin(2\pi x) \rvert}\leq \sum_{k>j} 4ke^{-d k^2}\leq  \sum_{k>j} 4k^2e^{-d k^2}
\]
and we can apply the previous bounds for $\sum_{k\geq 6}2k^2e^{-dk^2/3}$
Thus, we have for $d>1$ the following bounds, where again $\tfo'(t,j), \tft'(t,j)$ indicate the truncation of the sum involved in $\tfo'(t),\tft'(t)$ after $j$ terms:
\begin{proposition}
For $t_1=\pm 1$, $t_2\in\{-1,-\frac12,\frac12,1\}$
\begin{align}
\tfo'(t_1,2)-\frac{e^{-4d}}{8}&\leq \tfo'(t_1)\leq \tfo'(t_1,2)+\frac{e^{-4d}}{8}\\
\tft'(t_2,5)-4e^{-25d/3}&\leq \tft'(t_2)\leq \tft'(t_2,5)+4e^{-25d/3}
\end{align}
\end{proposition}
Finally, we need bounds for $\tft(\pm\frac12)$.
Again, using the chain rule, we obtain
\begin{align}
\tth''(d/3,-1/2)&=\left(\sum_{k\geq 2}2ke^{-\frac{d}{3}k^2}
\frac{\cot(2\pi x)\sin(2\pi kx)-k\cos(2\pi kx)}{\sin^2(2\pi x)}\right)
\bigg|_{x=-1/2}\\
&=\sum_{k\geq 2}-8/3k e^{-\frac{d}{3}k^2}\left (k \cos(2\pi k/3)+\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\sin(2\pi k/3)\right).
\end{align}
Likewise, 
\[
\tth''(d/3,1/2)=\sum_{k\geq 2}-8/3k e^{-\frac{d}{3}k^2}\left (k \cos(2\pi k/3)-\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\sin(2\pi k/3)\right)
\]
Note 
\[
\left\lvert-8/3k e^{-\frac{d}{3}k^2}\left (k \cos(2\pi k/3)+\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\sin(2\pi k/3)\right) \right \rvert \leq \frac83 k(k+1)e^{-\frac{d}{3}k^2}, 
\]
so using the fact that $(k+6)(k+7)\leq 42e^{k/3}$ for $k\geq 0$ yields 
\begin{align}
\left\lvert \sum_{k\geq 6} -8/3k e^{-\frac{d}{3}k^2}\left (k \cos(2\pi k/3)+\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\sin(2\pi k/3)\right)\right\rvert &\leq \sum_{k\geq 6}\frac83 k(k+1)e^{-\frac{d}{3}k^2}\\
&= \frac83 \sum_{k\geq 0}(k+6)(k+7)e^{-\frac{d}{3}(k+6)^2}\\
&\leq e^{-25d/3}\frac83 e^{-11/3}\sum_{k\geq 0}(k+6)(k+7)e^{-\frac{d}{3}(k^2+12k)}\\
&\leq e^{-25d/3}\frac83 e^{-11/3}\sum_{k\geq 0}42e^{k/3}e^{-(k^2+12k)/3}\\
&\leq e^{-25d/3}\frac83 e^{-11/3}\sum_{k\geq 0}42e^{-4k}\\
&=\frac{112e^{-25d/3}}{e^{11/3}(1-e^{-4})}\leq 5e^{-25d/3}.
\end{align}
Thus, we obtain our final bounds 
\begin{proposition}
\begin{align}
\tft''(\pm \frac12,5)-5e^{-25d/3}\leq \tft''(\pm \frac12)\leq \tft''(\pm \frac12,5)+5e^{-25d/3}
\end{align}
\end{proposition}
As a final remark, it is straightforward to check that each of these lower bounds is at least 0 for all $d>1$.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{$\tf \geq \tg$ for small $a$ and 4 points}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
First, we prove that 
$\frac{\partial^3 \tf}{\partial t_1 \partial t_{2}^2 }\bigg|_{-1,\frac12} \geq 0$ to complete the proof of Lemma \ref{3rdorderpartial}. We'll use the notation $\tfo^{u}(t), \tfo^{l}(t)$ to denote the upper and lower bounds given in the previous section and likewise for $\tft$. 
We  have 
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial^3 \tf}{\partial t_1 \partial t_{2}^2 }\bigg|_{-1,\frac12} 
&\geq \tfol'(-1)\tftl''(1/2)-\tfou'(1)\tftu''(-1/2)
\end{align}
\normalsize
In the accompanying mathematica notebook, we expand the products and simplify, resulting in an analytic expression whose positivity is easy to verify. 
Next, we prove Lemma \ref{inequalitystring}
\begin{proof}
\[ 
2\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1 }\bigg|_{-1,1/2} 
\leq \frac{\partial^2 \tf-\tg}{\partial t_1 \partial t_2}\bigg|_{-1,1/2}.
\]
Using the bounds from the previous section,,
\begin{align}
2\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1 }\bigg|_{-1,1/2} &\leq 2
\left [ \tfou'(-1)\tftu(1/2)-\tfol'(1)\tftl(-1/2)
\right],\\
\frac{\partial^2 \tf}{\partial t_1 \partial t_2 }\bigg|_{-1,1/2}&=\tfo'(-1)\tft'(1/2)+\tfo'(1)\tft'(-1/2)\\
    &\geq \tfol'(-1)'\tftl(1/2)+\tfol'(1)\tftl(-1/2).
\end{align}
We show the desired inequality in a similar fashion as with $\frac{\partial^3 \tf}{\partial t_1 \partial t_{2}^2 }\bigg|_{-1,\frac12}$ in the Mathematica file. 

It remains to show
\[
4(\tf(-1,1)-\tf(-1,1/2)), \frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_2}\bigg|_{-1,1}
\leq 
2\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1 }\bigg|_{-1,1/2}. 
\]
Again with our bounds we have:
\begin{align}
 4(\tf(-1,1)-\tf(-1,1/2)) &=4 \left[ \tfo(-1)(\tft(1)-\tft(-1/2))+ \tfo(1)(\tft(-1)-\tft(-1/2))\right] \\  
 &\leq 
 4\left[ 
\tfou(-1)(\tftu(1)-\tftl(-1/2)+\tfou(1)(\tftu(-1)-\tftl(-1/2))
 \right]\\
 2\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1 }\bigg|_{-1,1/2}
 &\geq 
2
\left [ \tfol'(-1)\tftl(1/2)-\tfou'(1)\tftu(-1/2)
\right].
\end{align}
The proof that the corresponding difference is nonnegative is in the notebook. 

Finally, 
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_2}\bigg|_{-1,1} \leq
    \tfou(-1)\tftu'(1)-\tfol(1)\tftl'(-1)
\end{align}
which we compare in mathematica with the upper bound for $2\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1 }\bigg|_{-1,1/2}$ given above.
\end{proof}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{$\tf \geq \tg$ for small $a$ and 6 points}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
First, we handle the necessary derivative conditions:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Satisfying Necessary Conditions}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Recall we aim to show 
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,-1}\geq 0\\
\frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,\frac12} \geq 0\\
\frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{1,-\frac12}\leq 0.
\end{align}
\begin{proof}
First, we'll compute bounds for $b_{1,0},b_{0,2}$.
Recall
\begin{align}
2b_{1,0}&=\tfo(1)\tft(-1/2)-\tfo(-1)\tft(1/2)+\tfo(-1)\tft'(1/2)\\
\frac94 b_{0,2}&= \tfo(-1)(\tft(-1)-\tft(\frac12)+\frac32 \tft'(\frac12)).
\end{align}

Thus, using our bounds,
\begin{align}
\tfol(1)\tftl(-1/2)-\tfou(-1)\tftu(1/2)+\tfol(-1)\tftl'(1/2)
\leq 
2a_{1,0}\\
2a_{1,0}
\leq \tfou(1)\tftu(-1/2)-\tfol(-1)\tftl(1/2)+\tfou(-1)\tftu'(1/2)\\
\tfol(-1)(\tftl(-1)-\tftu(1/2)+\frac32 \tftl'(1/2)) \leq 
\frac94 b_{0,2}
\leq \tfou(-1)(\tftu(-1)-\tftl(1/2)+\frac32 \tftu'(1/2)).
\end{align}
Call these upper and lower bounds $a^{u}_{i,j},a^{l}_{i,j}$ respectively. Now we compute
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,-1}&=
\tfo'(d,-1)\tft(d,-1,5) - (a_{1,0}-a_{0,2})\\
&\geq  \tfol'(-1)\tftl(-1)-a^{u}_{1,0}+a^{l}_{0,2}
\end{align}
which we show positivity of in the notebook. 

The other conditions are similar. We must check the positivity of the lower bound
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,\frac12} \geq
    \tfol'(-1)\tftl(\frac12)
    -a^{u}_{1,0}-\frac12 a^{u}_{0,2}
 \end{align}
 and the upper bound 
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{1,-\frac12}\leq 
    \tfou'(1)\tftu(-\frac12)
    -a^{l}_{1,0}+\frac12 a^{u}_{0,2}
\end{align}
which completes the proof of the necessary conditions in the small $a$ case. 
\end{proof}
 

\subsubsection{Computations for the Linear Approximation Bound}
It remains to show $\tfo(1)-\tfo'(1)>0$ and produce lower bounds on $A,B,C$ such that $A>0,C>0$ and $B^2-2AC<0$. Equivalently, with those same bounds, $\frac{B}{C}-\frac{2A}{B}>0$ (as we'll assume $B<0$ else there is nothing to show).

\begin{lemma}
The following inequalities hold:
\begin{enumerate}
\item$\tfo(1)-\tfo'(1)\geq 0$
\item $A,C>0$
\end{enumerate}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We'll first show the stronger statement that $\tfo(1)-2\tfo'(1)\geq 0$. 
from the aforementioned bounds,
\begin{align}
\tfo(1)-2\tfo'(1)&\geq \tfol(1)-\tfou'(1)
\end{align}
whose nonnegativity is in the mathematica notebook. 
Next we want a lower bound for $A$. Recall 
\begin{align}
2A&=\left(\tfo(1)-2\tfo'(1)\right)\tft(-1/2)+\frac13\tfo(-1)\tft'(1/2)-\tfo(-1)\left(\frac49 \tft(-1)+\frac{5}{9}\tft(1/2)\right)\\
&\geq \left(\tfol(1)-2\tfou'(1)\right)\tftl(-1/2)+\frac13\tfol(-1)\tftl'(1/2)-\tfou(-1)\left(\frac49 \tftu(-1)+\frac{5}{9}\tftu(1/2)\right) .\\
\end{align}

Finally, we generate a lower bound for $C$. Again recall
\begin{align}
    C&=\left(\tfo(1)-\tfo'(1)\right)\tft''(-1/2)-2b_{0,2}\\
    &\leq \left(\tfol(1)-\tfou'(1)\right)\tftu''(-1/2)-2b^{l}_{0,2}
\end{align}
We check the positivity of both bounds in the notbeook. 
\end{proof}

It remains to show 
We also need to provide a lower bound for $B$. Recall\\
\begin{align}
B&=b_{0,2}-\tfo'(1)\tft'(-1/2)\\
&\geq b^{l}_{0,2}-\tfou'(1)\tftu'(-1/2).
\end{align}
Utilizing the computations in the mathematica notebook we've found lower bounds for $A,B,C$, with the $A$ and $C$ bounds shown to be positive: 
\begin{align}
    A_L&:=2951/600 e^{-16 d/3}+ 4879/600 e^{-13 d/3} - 2429/200 e^{-4 d} + 
 2 e^{-3 d}\\
    B_L&:=14309/450e^{-16d/3} - 65/4e^{-13d/3}\\
    C_L&:= 3687/25e^{-7d} - 688/45e^{-19d/3} - 9377/225e^{-16d/3} - 
 24 e^{-3 d} + 16e^{-7d/3},
\end{align}
and either $B\geq0$ in which case the taylor polynomial is positive for $t_2\geq -\frac12$ or $B <0$ and so $B^2-2AC<B_L^2-2A_LC_L$, where $B_l$ is our lower bound for $B$. Thus, we'll assume $B<0$ and show $B_L^2-2A_LC_L<0$, which is equivalent to $B_L/C_L-2A_L/B_L>0$. We plug in $d=1$ and see it holds there. Then, we claim $B_L/C_L$ is increasing while $2A_L/B_L$ is decreasing, which would complete the proof. This final claim is proved in the mathematica notebook. For example, the sign of the derivative of $B_L/C_L=\frac{e^{13d/3}}{e^{13d/3}C_l}$ depends only on the sign of $(B_le^{13 d/3})' C_l - B_l (e^{13 d/3} C_l)'$, which we check to be positive for $d\geq 1$. 
The one proposition we use repeatedly for showing the positivity of various bounds is:
\begin{proposition}
Let 
$h(d)= a_1 e^{b_1 d}+\dots+ a_n e^{b_n d} $, where 
the $b_i$'s are increasing and there is some $j$ such that $a_1,\dots,a_{j-1} \leq 0\leq a_{j}, \dots, a_n$. Then $h(d)\geq 0$ for all $d\geq 1$ if and only if $h(1)\geq 0$. 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    Note $h(d)\geq 0$ if and only if $h(d) e^{-b_j d}\geq 0$. 
    \[
h(d)e^{-b_j d}= a_1 e^{(b_1-b_j) d}+\dots+ a_{j-1} e^{(b_{j-1}-b_j) d}
a_j+ \dots + a_n e^{b_n d}. 
    \]
    By our assumptions on the $a_{i}$'s and $b_{i}$'s, for $i<j$, $a_i$ and $b_i-b_j$ are both negative, so $a_i e^{(b_i-b_j)}$ is nondereasing. For $i\geq j$, both $a_i$ and $b_i-b_j$ are nonnegative, and so again $a_i e^{(b_i-b_j)}$ is nondecreasing. Thus, $h(d)e^{-b_j d}\geq 0 $ is nondecreasing, which suffices.  
\end{proof}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Technical Estimates and Computations for large $a$}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Throughout, assume that $a\geq 9.6$. We'll set $\epsilon=\frac{1}{1000}$ so that for all $a \geq  9.6$:
\begin{align}
    \epsilon \geq 2\sum_{n\geq 1} e^{-an} \text{ and }
    \epsilon \geq 5e^{-a}.
\end{align} Then set 
%$\delta=\frac15\geq  e^{-5a/12}(4+9\epsilon)$ for all $a\geq 9.6$ and
$\epsilon_2:=\frac{1}{100}\geq 4(1+\epsilon)^2\sum_{n\geq 1} e^{-2(9.6)n/3}$. \\

In the large $a$ case, it is preferable to use the following formula for $\theta$ because of its rapid convergence:
\[
\theta(c;x) =c^{-1/2} \sum^{\infty}_{k=-\infty} e^{-\frac{\pi(k+x)^2}{c}}.
\]
Thus, we'll use the formulas
\begin{align}
\tfo(x_1)= \sqrt{\frac{a}{\pi}}\theta(\frac{\pi}{a},x)=\sum^{\infty}_{k=-\infty} e^{-a(k+x)^2}\\
f_2(x_2)=\sqrt{\frac{3a}{\pi}}\theta(\frac{\pi}{3a},x)=\sum^{\infty}_{k=-\infty} e^{-3a(k+x)^2},
\end{align}
yielding in the $A_2$ case
\[
F(x)=\tfo(x_1)f_2(x_2)+\tfo(\frac12-x_1)f_2(\frac12-x_2),
\]
and in the $L$ case,
\[
F(x)=\tfo(x_1)f_2(x_2). 
\]

\subsection{Basic Lemmas and Other Estimates}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We first establish a couple basic workhorse lemmas bounding the tails of $\theta$ and $\tth'$ which we'll use repeatedly.

\begin{lemma}
\label{basicvalues}
For $0\leq x \leq \frac12$,
\begin{align}
e^{-a x^2}+e^{-a(x-1)^2} \leq \theta(\frac{\pi}{a},x)\leq (1+\epsilon) (e^{-a x^2}+ e^{-a(x-1)^2})&=(1+\epsilon)e^{-ax^2}(1+e^{-a(1-2x)})\leq 2(1+\epsilon)e^{-ax^2}
\\
e^{-a x^2} \leq \theta(\frac{\pi}{a},x)\leq e^{-a x^2}(1+ 2\sum_{n\geq 1}e^{-a (n^2-2nx)}).
\end{align}
In particular, for $u=\frac{\arccos(t_2)}{2\pi}$, $t_2\geq -\frac12$,
\begin{align}
e^{-3a u^2}&\leq \tft(t_2)\leq (1+\epsilon)e^{-3a u^2}\\
1&\leq \tfo(1),\tft(1)\leq 1+\epsilon\\
2e^{-a/4}&\leq \tfo(-1)\leq 2(1+\epsilon)e^{-a/4}\\
2e^{-3a/4}&\leq \tft(-1)\leq 2(1+\epsilon)e^{-3a/4}.
\end{align}

\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Recall $\theta(\frac{\pi}{a},x)=\sum_{n\in \mathbb{Z}}e^{-a(n+x)^2}$.
The lower bounds follow from simply truncating the series. To obtain the first upper bound, observe
\begin{align}
\sum_{n\in \mathbb{Z}}e^{-a(n+x)^2}&=\sum_{n\geq 0}e^{-a(n+x)^2} + \sum_{n\leq -1}e^{-a(n+x)^2}\\
&= e^{-ax^2}\sum_{n\geq 0}e^{-a(n^2+2 n x)}+e^{-a(x-1)^2}\sum_{n\geq 0}e^{-a(n^2+2(1-x)n)}\\
&\leq e^{-ax^2} \sum_{n\geq 0} e^{-a n^2}+e^{-a(x-1)^2}\sum_{n\geq 0}e^{-a(n^2)}\\
&\leq (e^{-ax^2}+e^{-a(1-x)^2})\sum_{n\geq 0}e^{-a n}\\
&\leq (1+\epsilon)(e^{-ax^2}+e^{-a(1-x)^2}).
\end{align}
The second upper bound follows in a similar fashion using the fact that for $n\geq 1$, the $n$th term is larger than the $-(n+1)$th term. The particular bounds all follow immediately except the first, where we use that  if $t_2\geq -\frac12$, $u\in[0,1/3]$ and so 
\[
2\sum_{n\geq 1}e^{-3a (n^2-2nx)}\leq 2\sum_{n\geq 1}e^{-3a(n-2n(1/3))}=2\sum_{n\geq 1}e^{-a}\leq \epsilon.
\]
\end{proof}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{lemma}
\label{basicderivs}
With  $x=\frac{\arccos(t)}{2\pi}$, 
\begin{align}
\frac{a e^{-a x^2}(x -(1-x)e^{-a(1-2x)})}{\pi \sin(2\pi x)}
\leq 
\frac{\partial \tth(\frac{\pi}{a},x)}{\partial t}
\leq 
\frac{a x e^{-a x^2}}{\pi \sin(2\pi x)}\\
\end{align}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Using $x=\frac{\arccos(t)}{2\pi}$, we have 
\[
\frac{\partial \tth(\frac{\pi}{a},x)}{\partial t}=\frac{\sum_{n\in \mathbb{Z}}-2a(n+x)e^{-a(n+x)^2} }{-2\pi \sin(2\pi x)}=\frac{a\sum_{n\in \mathbb{Z}}(n+x)e^{-a(n+x)^2} }{\pi \sin(2\pi x)}.
\]
Let $s_n=(n+x)e^{-a(n+x)^2}$.
Now to obtain the lower bound, we simply show check that for $n\geq 1$, $s_n+s_{-n-1}\geq 0$. Thus, $s_0+s_{-1}$ yields a lower bound. Similarly, we check $s_n+s_{-n}\leq 0$, so $s_{0}$ yields an upper bound. It will be independently useful that $s_0\geq s_{-1}$ for $\frac14\leq x\leq \frac12$. Indeed, in this case, taking $v=\frac12 -x$,
\[
ae^{-ax^2}(x-(1-x)e^{-a(1-2x)}=
ae^{-ax^2}(1/2-v-(1/2+v)e^{-2av})
\]
and 
$(1/2-v-(1/2+v)e^{-2av})$ is concave in $v$ for all 
$a\geq 9.6$, $v\in[0,\frac14]$, and so it suffices to check the inequality for $v=0,\frac14$, which are both immediate. 
\end{proof} 


We apply this lemma to obtain bounds on $\tth'(\pi/a,\pm1)$.
\begin{lemma}
\label{thetaderivpm1}
For $a\geq 9.6$, 
\begin{align}
 \frac{a}{2\pi^2}(a-2)e^{-a/4}
 &\leq \tth'(\frac{\pi}{a},-1)
 \leq
 \frac{a}{2\pi^2}(a-2+\epsilon)e^{-a/4}\\
\frac{(1-\epsilon_2)a}{2\pi^2}
 &\leq \tth'(\frac{\pi}{a},1)
 \leq
 \frac{a}{2\pi^2}.
\end{align}
For $a\geq 21$,
\begin{align}
 \frac{(1-\epsilon)a}{2\pi^2}
 &\leq \tth'(\frac{\pi}{a},1)
 \leq
 \frac{a}{2\pi^2}.
\end{align}.
\end{lemma}
 \begin{proof}
  We first have 
 \[
 \tth'(\pi/a,-1)=\frac{a}{2\pi^2}\sum_{n\in \mathbb{Z}}\left[ 2a(n+1/2)^2-1\right]e^{-a(n+1/2)^2}.
 \]
 We get an easy lower bound by just taking the $n=0,-1$ terms.
 For an upper bound, we bound the tail:
 \begin{align}
2\sum_{n\geq1}\left[ 2a(n+1/2)^2-1\right]e^{-a(n+1/2)^2}&
\leq e^{-a/4}4\sum_{n\geq1}\left[ a(n+1/2)^2-1\right]e^{-a(n^2+n)}\\
&\leq e^{-a/4}4\sum_{n\geq1}\left[ a(2n)^2\right]e^{-a(n^2+n)}\\
&\leq e^{-a/4}16\sum_{n\geq 1}an^2e^{-an^2}e^{-an}\\
&\leq e^{-a/4}16/1000\sum_{n\geq 1}e^{-an}\leq \epsilon e^{-a/4}
\end{align}
where we have used that $an^2e^{-an^2}\leq \frac{1}{1000}$ since
$be^{-b}\leq \frac{1}{1000}$ for $b\geq 9.6$.
Thus, we obtain the bounds 
\[
 \frac{a}{2\pi^2}(a-2)e^{-a/4}
 \leq \tth'(\pi/a,-1)
 \leq
 \frac{a}{2\pi^2}(a-2+\epsilon)e^{-a/4}.
\]

Next, 
\[
 \tth'(\pi/a,1)=\frac{a}{2\pi^2}\sum_{n\in \mathbb{Z}}\left[ 1-2an^2\right]e^{-an^2}.
 \]
 By just using the $n=0$ term, we get an easy upper bound. Now bounding the tail, we have

 \begin{align}
      \left\lvert 2 \sum_{n\geq 1}\left[ 1-2an^2\right]e^{-an^2}\right\rvert
      &\leq
      2\sum_{n\geq1}2an^2 e^{-an^2}\\
      &=4 \sum_{n\geq 1}an^2 e^{-an^2}\\
      &\leq 4\sum_{n\geq 1} e^{-2an^2/3}\\
      &\leq 4\sum_{n\geq 1} e^{-2an/3}\\
      &\leq 4\sum_{n\geq 1} e^{-2(9.6)n/3}\\
      &= \epsilon_2
 \end{align}
 since $be^{-b}\leq e^{-2b/3}$ for $b\geq 9.6$  
Thus, we have 
\begin{align}
\frac{(1-\epsilon_2)a}{2\pi^2}
 \leq &\tth'(\frac{\pi}{a},1)
 \leq
 \frac{a}{2\pi^2}
\end{align}
and when $a\geq 21$, we obtain that the tail is at most $4\sum_{n\geq 1} e^{-14n}<\epsilon$ in the same manner, and so in this case, 
\[
\frac{(1-\epsilon)a}{2\pi^2}
 \leq \tth'(\frac{\pi}{a},1)
 \leq
 \frac{a}{2\pi^2}
\]
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{thetaderivin[-1/2,1/2]}
For $a\geq 9.6$, $u=\frac{\arccos(t_2)}{2\pi}$ and $u\in [1/6,1/3]$ (i.e. $t_2\in [-1/2,1/2]$), 
\[
\tft'(t_2)\geq
\frac{3au e^{-3a u^2}(1-\epsilon)}{\pi \sin(2\pi u)}.
\]
In particular, 
$\tft'(\frac12)\geq \frac{(1-\epsilon)a e^{-a/12}}{\sqrt{3 \pi}}$, and $\tft'( -\frac12)\geq \frac{2(1-\epsilon)a e^{-a/3}}{\sqrt{3 \pi}}$.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
We have for $u\in [1/6,1/3]$ that $u-1\geq -5u$, $1-2u\geq \frac13$. Then applying the basic derivative lemma,
\[
\tth'(\frac{\pi}{3a},t_2)\geq \frac{3a e^{-a u^2}(u-(1-u)e^{-3a(1-2u)})}{\pi \sin(2\pi u)}\geq  \frac{3au e^{-a u^2}(1-5e^{-a})}{\pi \sin(2\pi u)}\geq  \frac{3au e^{-a u^2}(1-\epsilon)}{\pi \sin(2\pi u)} 
\]
as desired. 
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
\label{theta2ndderiv}
\begin{align}
\tft''(\frac12)
&\geq    \frac{4a}{\pi^2 }e^{-a/12} \left( -\frac12 + \frac{\pi}{6\sqrt{3}}+a/12  \right)
\\
%\tth''(\frac{\pi}{3a},-\frac12)
%&=\frac{4a}{\pi^2 }\sum_{n\in \mathbb{Z}} 
%e^{-3a(n+\frac13)^2} 
%\left( -\frac12 - \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{3}}%(n+\frac13)+3a(n+\frac13)^2  \right)
%\\
\tft''(-\frac12) 
&\leq 
\frac{4a}{\pi^2 }e^{-a/3} \left( \frac12 - \frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{3}}+a/3  \right)
\end{align}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
With $u=\frac{\arccos(t_2)}{2\pi}$, we compute
\[
\tth''(\frac{\pi}{3a},t_2)=\frac{3a}{\pi^2 \sin(2\pi u)^2}\sum_{n\in \mathbb{Z}}e^{-3a(n+u)^2} \left( -\frac12 + \pi\cot(2\pi u)(n+u)+3a(n+u)^2  \right)
\]
so that
\small
\begin{align}
\tth''(\frac{\pi}{3a},\frac12)&=\frac{4a}{\pi^2 }\sum_{n\in \mathbb{Z}} 
e^{-3a(n+\frac16)^2} 
\left( -\frac12 + \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{3}}(n+\frac16)+3a(n+\frac16)^2  \right)\\
&\geq    \frac{4a}{\pi^2 }e^{-a/12} \left( -\frac12 + \frac{\pi}{6\sqrt{3}}+a/12  \right)\\
\tth''(\frac{\pi}{3a},-\frac12)&=\frac{4a}{\pi^2 }\sum_{n\in \mathbb{Z}} 
e^{-3a(n+\frac13)^2} 
\left( -\frac12 - \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{3}}(n+\frac13)+3a(n+\frac13)^2  \right)\\
&=    
\frac{4a}{\pi^2 }e^{-a/3} \left( -\frac12 - \frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{3}}+a/3  \right) +
\frac{4a}{\pi^2 }
\sum_{n\neq 0}
e^{-3a(n+\frac13)^2} 
\left( -\frac12 - \frac{\pi}{\sqrt{3}}(n+\frac13)+3a(n+\frac13)^2  \right)\\
&\leq 
\frac{4a}{\pi^2 }e^{-a/3} \left( -\frac12 - \frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{3}}+a/3  \right) +
\frac{4a}{\pi^2 }
e^{-a/3}\sum_{n\neq 0}
e^{-3an^2+2n} \left(
\left| -\frac12\right|  +\left|\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{3}}(n+\frac13)\right|+\left|3a(n+\frac13)^2\right|  \right)\\
&\leq 
\frac{4a}{\pi^2 }e^{-a/3} \left( -\frac12 - \frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{3}}+a/3  \right) +
\frac{4a}{\pi^2 }
e^{-a/3}2\sum_{n\geq 1}
e^{-3an^2+2n} 8an^2\\
&\leq 
\frac{4a}{\pi^2 }e^{-a/3} \left( -\frac12 - \frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{3}}+a/3  \right) +
\frac{4a}{\pi^2 }
e^{-a/3}16\sum_{n\geq 1}
e^{-an^2} an^2\\
&\leq 
\frac{4a}{\pi^2 }e^{-a/3} \left( -\frac12 - \frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{3}}+a/3  \right) +
\frac{4a}{\pi^2 }
e^{-a/3}16\sum_{n\geq 1}
e^{\frac{-an^2}{2}}\\
&\leq 
\frac{4a}{\pi^2 }e^{-a/3} \left( -\frac12 - \frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{3}}+a/3  \right) +
\frac{4a}{\pi^2 }
e^{-a/3}\\
&=\frac{4a}{\pi^2 }e^{-a/3} \left( \frac12 - \frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{3}}+a/3  \right)
\end{align}
\normalsize
where for the first inequality we have just thrown away all the terms except for which $n=0$ (these are certainly all positive), and for the second string of inequalities, we have used that $be^{-b}\leq e^{-b/2}$ for $b\geq 9.6$ and then used a comparison with a geometric series to obtain $16\sum_{n\geq 1}
e^{\frac{-an^2}{2}}\leq 16\sum_{n\geq 1}
e^{\frac{-an}{2}}\leq 1$.
\end{proof}

\subsection{Intermediate $a$ and 4 points}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{calculations for Lemma \ref{inequalitystring}}
We'll prove Lemma \ref{inequalitystring} for $9.6<a\leq 21$.
\begin{proof}
First, we'll show
\[ 
2\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1 }\bigg|_{-1,1/2} 
\leq \frac{\partial^2 \tf-\tg}{\partial t_1 \partial t_2}\bigg|_{-1,1/2}.
\]

With the bounds from lemmas \ref{thetaderivin[-1/2,1/2]}, \ref{basicvalues}, \ref{thetaderivpm1}, we obtain
\begin{align}
    2\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1 }\bigg|_{-1,1/2} &\leq 2\left[
    \frac{a}{2\pi^2}(a-2+\epsilon)e^{-a/4}(1+\epsilon)e^{-a/12}-(1-\epsilon_2) \frac{a}{2\pi^2}e^{-a/3}  \right]\\
    &=\frac{e^{-a/3}}{\pi^2}\left[ 
    (a-2+\epsilon)(1+\epsilon)-(1-\epsilon_2)
    \right].\\
    \frac{\partial^2 \tf-\tg}{\partial t_1 \partial t_2}\bigg|_{-1,1/2}&\geq 
    %\frac{ae^{-a/12}(1-\epsilon)}{\pi\sqrt{3}}\frac{a e^{-a/4}(a-2)}{2\pi^2}
    %+
    %\frac{2ae^{-a/3}(1-\epsilon)}{\pi\sqrt{3}}\frac{a(1-\epsilon_2)}{2\pi^2}\\
     \frac{a^2 e^{-a/3}(1-\epsilon)(a-2\epsilon_2)}{2\pi^3 \sqrt{3}}.
\end{align}
Factoring out $\frac{ae^{-a/3}}{\pi^2}$ from each term, it suffices to show
\[
\frac{a(1-\epsilon)(a-2\epsilon_2)}{\sqrt{3}\pi}-\left( 2(a-2+\epsilon)-(1-\epsilon_2)\right) \geq 0
\]
and this is certainly true by just checking the  value and first derivative of this difference at $a=9.6$ are positive since it is quadratic in $a$ and convex. \\

Next we handle
\[
4(\tf(-1,1)-\tf(-1,1/2))
\leq 
2\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1 }\bigg|_{-1,1/2}.
\]
We have from Lemma \ref{basicvalues} and \ref{thetaderivpm1} that
\begin{align}
    4(\tf(-1,1)-\tf(-1,1/2))& \leq 4(2(1+\epsilon)^2(1+e^{-a/2})e^{-a/4}-3e^{-a/3})\\
    2\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1 }\bigg|_{-1,1/2}&\geq 2\left( \frac{a(a-2)e^{-a/4}}{2\pi^2}e^{-a/12}-\frac{a}{2\pi^2}(1+\epsilon)e^{-a/3}\right)\\
    &=\frac{a e^{-a/3}(a-3-\epsilon)}{\pi^2}.
\end{align}
 Adding $12e^{-a/3}$ to both sides, then factoring out  $e^{-a/4}$, it suffices to show 
\[
8(1+\epsilon)^2(1+e^{-a/2})\leq 8(1+\epsilon)^2(1+e^{-9.6/2}) \leq e^{-a/12}\left( 12+ \frac{a(a-3-\epsilon)}{\pi^2}\right).
\]
The first inequality is immediate, 

for the second we can check that on $[9.6,21]$, the final quantity is either increasing or concave, at any rate it doesn't have local minima, so it suffices to check the inequality at the endpoints $a=9.6,21$. All of the precise calculations are in the mathematica notebook. \\

Finally, we need to show $\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_2}\bigg|_{-1,1}
\leq 
2\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1 }\bigg|_{-1,1/2}$. We already have a lower bound for
$2\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1 }\bigg|_{-1,1/2}$ and from lemmas \ref{thetaderivpm1} and \ref{basicvalues}, we compute
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_2}\bigg|_{-1,1} \leq \frac{3ae^{-a/4}}{2\pi^2}
     \left( 
  (2+2\epsilon)-(3a-2)e^{-a/2}\right).
\end{align}
Factoring $\frac{a e^{-a/4}}{2\pi^2}$ from each bound, it suffices to show 
\begin{align}
   3(2+2\epsilon)-3(3a-2)e^{-a/2}
    \leq
    2(a-3-\epsilon)e^{-a/12}.
\end{align}


It's straightforward to show the 2nd quantity is concave, as handled in Mathematica, and \[
3(2+2\epsilon)-3(3a-2)e^{-b/2}\geq 
3(2+2\epsilon)-3(3a-2)e^{-a/2}
\]
for $a\in[9.6,21]$ and any constant $b$ satisfying $b\geq a$. So then it suffices to check 
\begin{align}
   3(2+2\epsilon)-3(3a-2)e^{-21/2}
    \leq
    2(a-3-\epsilon)\hspace{1cm} a=21,11\\
    3(2+2\epsilon)-3(3a-2)e^{-11/2}
    \leq
    2(a-3-\epsilon) \hspace{1cm} a=9.6 
\end{align}
which completes the proof.
\end{proof}

\subsubsection{Calculations for Lemma \ref{3rdorderpartial}}
Next, we show Lemma \ref{3rdorderpartial} for $a\geq 9.6$
\begin{proof}
We need to show 
\[
\tth'(\frac{\pi}{a},-1)\tth''(\frac{\pi}{3a},\frac12)-\tth'(\frac{\pi}{a},1)\tth''(\frac{\pi}{3a},-\frac12)\geq 0.
\]
\end{proof}
Using the bounds of lemmas \ref{thetaderivpm1} and \ref{theta2ndderiv}, we have:
\begin{align}
    \tth'(\frac{\pi}{a},-1)\tth''(\frac{\pi}{3a},\frac12)-\tth'(\frac{\pi}{a},1)\tth''(\frac{\pi}{3a},-\frac12)\geq
    \\
    \frac{a(a-2)e^{-a/4}}{2\pi^2}
      \frac{4a}{\pi^2 }e^{-a/12} \left( -\frac12 + \frac{\pi}{6\sqrt{3}}+a/12  \right)
    -
    \frac{a}{2\pi^2}
    \frac{4a}{\pi^2 }e^{-a/3} \left( \frac12 - \frac{\pi}{3\sqrt{3}}+a/3  \right)\\
    =\frac{a^2 e^{-a/3} (18 + 3 a^2 + 2 a (-18 + \sqrt{3} \pi))}{18\pi^4}.
\end{align}
The inner expression is quadratic in $a$ and it is straightforward to check that it's positive with positive slope at $a=9.6$, as done in the accompanying notebook.
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Large $a$ and 4 points}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Now we assume $a\geq 21$, and first present the proof of lemma 
\ref{derivcomp}
\begin{proof}
Using the bounds on $\tth$ given in the appendix lemmas \ref{basicvalues} and \ref{thetaderivpm1}, we obtain
 \begin{align}
     0&\leq \frac{ae^{-a/4}}{2\pi^2} \left(
     (a-2)-(2+2\epsilon)e^{-a/2}
     \right)
     \leq \frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{(-1,1)}
     \leq 
     \frac{ae^{-a/4}}{2\pi^2}(a-2+\epsilon)(1+\epsilon)
     \\
    0&\leq \frac{3(2-4\epsilon)ae^{-a/4}}{2\pi^2}
    \leq 
    \frac{3ae^{-a/4}}{2\pi^2}
     \left( 
     2(1-\epsilon)-(1+\epsilon)(3a-2+\epsilon)e^{-a/2}
     \right) 
     \leq \frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_2}\bigg|_{(-1,1)}
     \leq 
     \frac{3ae^{-a/4}}{\pi^2}
  (1+\epsilon).
 \end{align}
 Where for the first nontrivial $\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_2}\bigg|_{(-1,1)}$ inequality, we have used that 
 \[
(1+\epsilon)(3a-2+\epsilon)e^{-a/2}
\leq
3a(1+\epsilon)e^{-a/2}
\leq 
2\epsilon
 \]
 as verified in mathematica.
 Thus,
 \begin{align}
    \frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{(-1,1)}-\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_2}\bigg|_{(-1,1)} &\geq
    \frac{ae^{-a/4}}{2\pi^2}
    \left(
    a-2- 3(2+2\epsilon)-e^{-a/2}(2+2\epsilon)\right)\\
    &=\frac{ae^{-a/4}}{2\pi^2}\left( a-8-6\epsilon- e^{-a/2}(2+2\epsilon)\right)
 \end{align}
 which is clearly positive for $a\geq 21$.
\end{proof}

Next, we present the proof of Lemma \ref{bottominequality}:
\begin{proof}
Using appendix lemmas \ref{basicvalues} and \ref{thetaderivpm1}, 
\begin{align}
(\tf-\tg)(-1,1/2)&=\tf(-1,1/2)-\tf(-1,1)+\frac{b_1}{4}\\
&\geq 3e^{-a/3}- 2(1+\epsilon^2)e^{-a/4}-2(1+\epsilon)^2 e^{-3a/4}             +  \frac{3(2-4\epsilon)ae^{-a/4}}{2\pi^2}\\
&=e^{-a/4}\left[ 3e^{-a/12}-2(1+\epsilon)^2(1+e^{-a/2}) +
  \frac{3(2-4\epsilon)a}{2\pi^2}
\right]\\
&\leq e^{-a/4}\left[ 3e^{-a/12}-2(1+\epsilon)^3 +  \frac{3(2-4\epsilon)a}{2\pi^2}
\right].
\end{align}
The positivity depends only on the quantity inside the brackets, which is convex in $a$, so it suffices to check value and derivative at $a=21$, as handled in the mathematica notebook.  
\end{proof}

Now we present the remaining components of the proof of Lemma \ref{4ptlinearization}: 
\begin{proof}
Recall we have 
\[
\tf_T:=(e^{-ax^2}+e^{-a(x-1)^2})e^{-3a u^2}+ e^{-a((\frac12-x)^2+3(\frac12-u)^2}
\]
and note that for $a<t_1<0$, $0<t_2<b$, with $t_2+a<0$, we have the following upper bound for $\tg$
\begin{align}
\tg\leq \tg_{a,b}&:= \tf(-1,1) + b_1 t_2^2 +b_1(b t_1+a t_2-a b)\\
&\leq \tfou(-1)\tftu(1)+\tfou(1)\tftu(-1)+b_1^l t_2(t_2+a)+b_1^l(b t_1)-b c b_1^u\\
&\leq 2(1+\epsilon)^3 e^{-a/4}+b_1^l t_2(t_2+a)+b_1^l(b t_1)-b c b_1^u
\end{align}
where
\[
\tfou(-1)\tftu(1)+\tfou(1)\tftu(-1)= 2e^{-a/4}(1+\epsilon)^2(1+e^{-a/2})\leq 2e^{-a/4}(1+\epsilon)^3
\]
and $b_1^l$ and $b_1^u$ are our earlier lower and upper bounds on  
$\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_2}\bigg|_{(-1,1)}$, given again below
\[
\frac{3(2-4\epsilon)ae^{-a/4}}{2\pi^2}
     \leq \frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_2}\bigg|_{(-1,1)}
     \leq 
     \frac{3ae^{-a/4}}{\pi^2}
  (1+\epsilon).
\]
Note that the final bound for $\tg_{a,b}$ , call it $\tg_{a,b}'$, is linear in $a$, up to a factor of $e^{-a/4}$, as desired. In the mathematica notebook, we then show that when $a\geq21$
\begin{align}
\tg_{-1,1}' &\leq \tf_T  \text{ for } (\cos(2\pi \sqrt{3}/4, t_2), t_2 \in [.7,1] \text{ and } (t_1,.7), t_1 \in (-1, \cos(2\pi \sqrt{3}/4)\\
\tg_{-1,.7}' &\leq \tf_T  \text{ for } (\cos(2\pi \sqrt{3}/4, t_2), t_2 \in [.6,.7] \text{ and } (t_1,.6), t_1 \in (-1, \cos(2\pi \sqrt{3}/4)\\
\tg_{-1,.6}' &\leq \tf_T  \text{ for } (\cos(2\pi \sqrt{3}/4, t_2), t_2 \in [.5,.7] \text{ and } (t_1,.5), t_1 \in (-1, \cos(2\pi \sqrt{3}/4)\\
\end{align}
by showing the inequalities hold when $a=21$ and the corresponding differences are increasing in $a$ at $a=21$. 
\end{proof}

















Finally, we present the proof of Lemma \ref{largea4ptt1growth}.
\begin{proof}
    Recall it remains to show that at $P=( \cos(2\pi \frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}), \cos(2\pi \frac{\sqrt{3}}{12})):=(t_1',t_2')$,
\[
\frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{P}\geq 0, \hspace{1 cm} \frac{\partial^2 \tf-\tg}{\partial t_1 \partial t_2}\bigg|_{P}\geq 0.
\]

For the first inequality, we first have using lemmas \ref{basicderivs} and \ref{basicvalues}, $x=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4}$, $u=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{12}$
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \tf}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{P}&\geq \frac{a}{\pi \sin(2\pi x)}\left( e^{-ax^2}(x-(1-x)e^{-a(1-2x)}) e^{-3a u^2} -(\frac12-x)e^{-a(\frac12-x)^2}2(1+\epsilon)e^{-3a(1/2-u)^2} \right)\\
&= \frac{ae^{-a/4}}{\pi \sin(2\pi x)}\left((x-(1-x)e^{-a(1-2x)}) -(\frac12-x)2(1+\epsilon)e^{-a(1-x-3u)} \right)\\
&\geq  \frac{38ae^{-a/4}}{\pi 41}
\end{align}
using the fact that $x-(1-x)e^{-a(1-2x)}\geq .39$,  $(\frac12-x)2(1+\epsilon)e^{-a(1-x-3u})\leq \frac{1}{100}$, and $\sin(2\pi x)\leq .41$
 for $a\geq 21$.
On the other hand, 
since $\cos(2\pi u)\leq .62$,
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial \tg}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{P}&\leq .62 b_1 \\
&\leq \frac{a e^{-a/4} 3 (1+\epsilon).62}{\pi^2}.
\end{align}
Thus, 
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{P}&\geq
\frac{ae^{-a/4}}{\pi}\left( \frac{38}{41}-\frac{3(1+\epsilon).62}{\pi}\right)
\end{align}
and this inner quantity is positive. 

It remains to show $\frac{\partial^2 \tf-\tg}{\partial t_1 \partial t_2}\bigg|_{P}\geq 0$ in much the same fashion. 
Using the same bound on $b_1$, 
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial^2 \tg}{\partial t_1 \partial t_2}\bigg|_{P}&= b_1 \leq \frac{a e^{-a/4} 3 (1+\epsilon)}{ \pi^2}.
\end{align}

Now using Lemma \ref{basicderivs},
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial^2 \tf}{\partial t_1 \partial t_2}\bigg|_{P}&\geq \tfo'(\cos(2\pi x))\tft'(\cos(2\pi u))\\
&\geq \frac{39 ae^{-a x^2}}{41 \pi }\frac{3a e^{-3 a u^2}(u-(1-u)e^{-3a(1-2u)})}{\pi \sin(2\pi u)}\\
&\geq \frac{5*3*39 a^2e^{-a/4}}{4*41 \pi^2 }(u-(1-u)e^{-3a(1-2u)})\\
&\geq \frac{14*5*3*39 a^2e^{-a/4}}{100*4*41 \pi^2 }
\end{align}
since $\sin(2\pi u)\leq \frac{4}{5}$ and $u-(1-u)e^{-3a(1-2u)}\geq .14$.
Thus, 
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial^2 \tf-\tg}{\partial t_1 \partial t_2}\bigg|_{P}&\geq
\frac{14*5*3*39 a^2e^{-a/4}}{100*4*41 \pi^2 }- \frac{a e^{-a/4} 3 (1+\epsilon)}{ \pi^2}\\
&=\frac{a e^{-a/4}}{\pi^2}\left(\frac{14*5*3*39a}{100*4*41}-3(1+\epsilon)\right).
\end{align}
The inner quantity is increasing in $a$ and so it suffices to check at $a=21$ in the notebook. 
\end{proof}

Again, we take $a\geq 9.6$.

\subsubsection{Coefficient Bounds}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Our first task is using estimates on $\theta$ to bound the coefficients of $\tg$. 
\begin{lemma}{Bounds on $a_{i,j}$}
\label{abounds}
\begin{align}
   0\leq \frac{2(1-\epsilon)a}{\sqrt{3}\pi} \leq & e^{a/3 }a_{0,1}\leq \frac{2(1+\epsilon)a}{\sqrt{3}\pi}\\

\leq \frac89 \left( \frac98 \epsilon_2-(1+\epsilon) +\frac{\sqrt{3}a(1+\epsilon)}{2\pi}\right)\\
%(-2-7\epsilon + \frac{(3-2\epsilon) a}{\sqrt{3}\pi})\leq  & e^{a/3 }a_{0,2} \leq \frac49e^{-a/3}(-2+2\epsilon+\delta +\frac{(3+3\epsilon)a}{\sqrt{3}\pi})\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
0\leq \frac32-\frac29(1+\epsilon)+\frac{\sqrt{3}a(1-\epsilon)}{9\pi}
\leq &
e^{a/3 }b_{0,0}
\leq 
\frac32(1+3\epsilon)+\frac14 \epsilon_2 -\frac29(1+\epsilon) +\frac{\sqrt{3}a(1+\epsilon)}{9\pi}
%0\leq e^{-a/3}(\frac32 +\frac19(-2-7\epsilon)+ \frac{(3-2\epsilon) a}{\sqrt{3}\pi})\leq & e^{a/3 }b_{0,0}\leq e^{-a/3}(\frac32 +4\epsilon+ \frac19 (-2+2\epsilon+\delta) +\frac{(3+3\epsilon)a}{\sqrt{3}\pi}). 
\end{align}
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
We begin by using lemmas \ref{basicvalues} and \ref{thetaderivin[-1/2,1/2]} to multiply our bounds on $\tfo(1),\tft'(-\frac12)$ to obtain our bound on $a_{0,1}$.

Next, using this bound, combined with Lemma \ref{basicvalues} and our definition 
\[
a_{1,0}:=\frac{\tfo(1)\tft(-1/2)-\tfo(-1)\tft(1/2)}{2}+\frac{a_{0,1}}{2},
\] we obtain the bounds for $a_{1,0}$. We also use the fact that $e^2<e$ so that $(1+\epsilon)^2<1+3\epsilon$. 

The bounds for 
\[a_{0,0}:=\frac{\tfo(1)\tft(-1/2)+\tfo(-1)\tft(1/2)}{2}
\]
follow in the same manner. For $a_{0,2}$, we next compute that 
\[
0 \leq \frac49 \tfo(-1)\tft(-1)\leq\frac49 e^{-a}4(1+\epsilon)^2\leq e^{-a/3}\epsilon_2.
\]
Now using the definition,
\[
a_{0,2}=\frac49\tfo(-1)(\tft(-1)-\tft(1/2)+\frac32 \tft'(1/2))
\]
 we obtain the bounds for $a_{0,2}$.

Finally, the $a_{0,0}$ bound follows immediately from previous bounds and the definition $b_{0,0}:=a_{0,0}+a_{0,2}/4$.
\end{proof}
We use the notation $a_{i,j}^{u}$ $a_{i,j}^{l}$ for the upper and lower bounds respectively, and we note that the bounds are linear in $a$ up to a factor of $e^{-a/3}$, and so the nonnegativity follows from simply checking when $a=9.6$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Satisfying Necessary Conditions for large $a$}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Recall we aim to show 
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,-1}\geq 0\\
\frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,\frac12} \geq 0\\
\frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{1,-\frac12}\leq 0.
\end{align}
\begin{proof}
For the first condition, using Lemma \ref{abounds} and the absolute monotonicity of $\tth$, we have:
\begin{align}
    e^{a/3}\left(\frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,-1}\right)&\geq 
     e^{a/3}\left(\frac{\partial -\tg}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,-1}\right)\\
     &=
    e^{a/3}(b_{1,0}-b_{0,2})\\
    &\geq e^{a/3}b_{0,2}^{l}-e^{a/3}b^{u}_{1,0}.
\end{align}
But this last quantity is linear in $a$, and so it suffices to check it has a positive coefficient of $a$ and is positive when $a=9.6$., as handled in the mathematica notebook.\\

Now incorporating lemmas \ref{basicderivs} and \ref{thetaderivpm1},
\begin{align}
e^{a/3}\left( \frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-1,\frac12}\right) &\geq
e^{a/3}\frac{a(a-2)}{2\pi^2}e^{-a/4}e^{-a/12}-(e^{a/3}b^{u}_{1,0}+\frac{e^{a/3}}{2} b^{u}_{0,2})\\
&=\frac{a(a-2)}{2\pi^2}-(e^{a/3}b^{u}_{1,0}+\frac{e^{a/3}}{2} b^{u}_{0,2}).\\
\end{align}
This quantity is quadratic in $a$ and convex up, so it suffices to check it is positive with positive slope at $a=9.6$, again in the notebook.
Finally,
\begin{align}
e^{a/3}\left( \frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{1,-\frac12}\right) &\leq
e^{a/3}\frac{a}{2\pi^2}e^{-a/3}(1+\epsilon)-(e^{a/3}b^{l}_{1,0}-\frac{e^{a/3}}{2} b^{u}_{0,2})\\
&=\frac{(1+\epsilon)a}{2\pi^2}-(e^{a/3}b^{l}_{1,0}-\frac{e^{a/3}}{2} b^{u}_{0,2})\\
\end{align}
and this last quantity is linear in $a$, so we simply check it has a negative coefficient of $a$ and is negative for $a=9.6$ to ensure it is negative for all $a\geq 9.6$.
\end{proof}
 





%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Bounds for proofs of lemmas \ref{linearization1} and \ref{linearization2}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
It remains to show that 
%\[
%\tf_T\geq \tg_{a,b}'
%\hspace{.25cm}
%\text{ and } 
%\hspace{.25cm}
%\frac{\partial \left[e^{a/3}(\tf_T- \tg_{a,b}'\right]}{\partial a}\bigg|_{a=9.6}\geq 0
%\]
$\tf_T\geq \tg_{a,b}'$
for various $a,b$ and 
various line segments in the critical region $[-1,1]\times [-1/2,1/2]$, where $\tg_{a,b}'$ is an upper bound for $\tg_{a,b}$ obtained by replacing $a_{i,j}$'s with upper and lower bounds from Lemma \ref{abounds}. \\

In particular, when $a<t_1<0$, $0<t_2<b$, so $t_1t_2<0$, we define 
\begin{align}
\tg_{a,b}' &:= b^{u}_{0,0}+a_{1,0}^{l} t_1 a_{0,1}^{u}t_2+a_{0,2}^{u} t_2^2+ a_{0,2}^{l}(b t_2 +at_2 -a b),
\end{align}
and when $a<t_1<0$, $t_2<b\leq 0$, so $t_1t_2\geq 0$
\begin{align}
\tg_{a,b}' &:= b^{u}_{0,0}+a_{1,0}^{l} t_1 a_{0,1}^{l}t_2+a_{0,2}^{u} t_2^2+ a_{0,2}^{u}(b t_2 +at_2 -a b).
\end{align}
Note in both of these cases, $\tg_{a,b}'$  is linear in $a$ up to a factor of $e^{a/3}$. Specifically, to complete the proof of lemmas \ref{linearization1} and \ref{linearization2} we want for $a\geq 9.6$ that
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $\tf_T \geq g_{-1,1/2}'$ on $\{(-\sqrt{2}/2,t_2)\mid t_2\in[\frac14,\frac12]\} \cup \{(t_1,\frac14)\mid t_1\in[-1,-\sqrt{2}/2]\}$
    \item $\tf_T \geq g_{-1,1/4}'$ on $\{(-\sqrt{2}/2,t_2)\mid t_2\in[0,\frac14]\} \cup \{(t_1,0)\mid t_1\in[-1,-\sqrt{2}/2]\}$
    \item $\tf_T \geq g_{-\sqrt{2}/2,0}'$ on $\{(-\sqrt{2}/2,t_2)\mid t_2\in[-.1,0]\} \cup
    \{(0,t_2)\mid t_2\in[-.1,0]\}
    \cup
    \{(t_1,-.1) \mid t_1\in[-\sqrt{2}/2,0]\}$
    \item $\tf_T \geq g_{-\sqrt{2}/2,-.1}'$ on $\{(-\sqrt{2}/2,t_2)\mid t_2\in[-.2,-.1]\} \cup
    \{(0,t_2)\mid t_2\in[-.2,-.1]\}
    \cup
    \{(t_1,-.2)\mid t_1\in[-\sqrt{2}/2,0]\}$,
\end{enumerate}
as handled in the mathematica notebook by checking the positivity of these differences (times a factor of $e^{a/3}$ and their derivatives at $a=9.6$. 
%Note: For the horizontal line segments with $t_2=\frac14,-.1,-.18$, we use $u=\frac{21}{100},\frac{107}{400},\frac{7}{25}$, respectively in the formula for $\tf_T$ rather than the exact $u$ values like $\frac{\arccos{\frac14}}{2\pi}$.
%But because $\tf_T$ is decreasing in $u$, it suffices to take these upper bounds on the exact $u$-values, and it makes the calculations easier. 


%So then the computer check needs to go as follows:
%We take each of the segments which has either $t_1$ or $t_2$ varying in $[p_0,p_n]$. 
%Abusing notation, we treat $\tf_T$ and $\tg_T$ as one variable functions of $t$ since along each segment one of $t_1,t_2$ is fixed. 
%Then we partition the interval up into $p_0,p_1,..,p_n$ (not arbitrary, we specify how). 
%Both $\frac{\partial \tg^{u}_{a,b}}{\partial a}\bigg|_{a=9.6}$ and $\tg_{a,b}^{u}$ are convex in $t$ (linear in the case of $t_2$ being fixed), 
%thus attaining maximums only at endpoints. 
%Meanwhile, as we have shown in the previous lemma, $\frac{\partial e^{a/3}\tf_T}{\partial a}\bigg|_{a=9.6}$ and $\tf_T$ are both increasing in $t$, 
%so their minimum occurs at left endpoints. 
%Thus, we show that for each $i=0,1,...,n-1$, it suffices to show \[
%\tf_T(p_i)\geq \max\{\tg_{a,b}(p_i),\tg_{a,b}(p_{i+1})\}
%\] and similarly,
%\[
%\frac{\partial e^{a/3}\tf_T}{\partial a}\bigg|_{a=9.6,t=p_i}\geq
%\max \{ \frac{\partial \tg^{u}_{b,c}}{\partial a}\bigg|_{a=9.6,t=p_i},\frac{\partial \tg^{u}_{b,c}}{\partial a}\bigg|_{a=9.6,t=p_{i+1}} \}
%\]
\subsubsection{computations for proof of Lemma \ref{t1deriv}}
Recall it remains to show $\frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-\sqrt{2}/2,0}\geq 0$. By lemmas \ref{basicderivs}, \ref{basicvalues} and our coefficient estimates to show:
\begin{align}
    \frac{\partial (\tf-\tg)}{\partial t_1}\bigg|_{-\sqrt{2}/2,0}&= \tfo'(-\sqrt{2}/2)\tft(0)-b_{1,0}\\
    &\geq 
    \frac{(ae^{-a(3/8)^2}(3/8-5/8e^{-a/4}))}{\pi (1/\sqrt{2})}e^{-3a/16}-e^{-a/3}(-1/2+\frac32\epsilon+\frac{(1+\epsilon)a}{\sqrt{3\pi}})\\
    &=e^{-a/3}\left[\frac{\sqrt{2}a e^{a/192}(3-5e^{-a/4})}{8\pi}-(-1/2+\frac32 \epsilon+\frac{(1+\epsilon)a}{\sqrt{3\pi}})\right].
\end{align}
We claim that 
$$\frac{\sqrt{2}ae^{a/192}(3-5e^{-a/4})}{8\pi}-(-1/2+\frac32 \epsilon+\frac{(1+\epsilon)a}{\sqrt{3\pi}})$$
is positive for $a=9.6$ and increasing in $a$ for $a\geq 9.6$. The first of these conditions is a simple computer check contained in the mathematica notebook. For the latter,
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{da}&\left[    \frac{\sqrt{2}ae^{a/192}(3-5e^{-a/4})}{8\pi}-(-1/2+2\epsilon+\frac{(1+\epsilon)a}{\sqrt{3\pi}})\right]
\\
&=\frac{ \sqrt{2}e^{-47 a/
  192} (-960 + 235 a + 576 e^{a/4} + 3 a e^{a/4})}{8\pi}-\frac{(1+\epsilon)}{\sqrt{3}\pi}\\
  &> \frac{ \sqrt{2}e^{-47 a/
  192} (576 e^{a/4} + 3 a e^{a/4})}{8\pi}-\frac{(1+\epsilon)}{\sqrt{3}\pi}\\
  &=\frac{ \sqrt{2}(576 e^{a/192} + 3 a e^{a/192})}{8\pi}-\frac{(1+\epsilon)}{\sqrt{3}\pi}
\end{align}
where this last quantity is greater than $0$ because it's true for $a=9.6$ (see the notebook) and clearly increasing in $a$.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% 
\subsubsection{Positivity of $L_1$ for Lemma \ref{gradientcomp}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Recall to prove Lemma \ref{gradientcomp}, it suffices to show that 
\[
L_1(t_1,t_2):=\frac{\tft'\tfo}{\tfo'\tft}-\frac{\frac{\partial \tg}{\partial t_2}}{\frac{\partial \tg}{\partial t_1}}> 0.
\]
We first bound $\frac{\tfo\tft'}{\tfo'\tft}$below. 
Using the basic value lemma, $\tfo\geq e^{-ax^2}$. Since $\lvert t_2\rvert \leq  \frac12$, (i.e. $u\leq \frac13$), by Lemma \ref{basicvalues} it follows that
\begin{align}
    \tft \leq e^{-3a u^2}(1+\epsilon). 
\end{align}
With Lemma \ref{basicderivs}, $\tfo'\leq \frac{a x e^{-ax^2}}{\pi\sin(2\pi x)}$. Finally, with $u\in[1/4,1/3]$, we have
by Lemma \ref{thetaderivin[-1/2,1/2]},
\begin{align}
\tft' \geq 
\frac{3a u e^{-3au^2}(1-\epsilon)}{\pi \sin(2\pi u)}.
\end{align}
Combining these bounds, we obtain:
\begin{align}
    \frac{\tfo\tft'}{\tfo'\tft}\geq \frac{e^{-3a x^2}3a e^{-3au^2}u (1-\epsilon)}{\pi \sin(2\pi u)}\cdot \frac{\pi\sin(2\pi x)}{a x e^{-ax^2}e^{-3a u^2}(1+\epsilon)}=\frac{3u(1-\epsilon)\sin(2\pi x)}{(1+\epsilon)x\sin(2\pi u)}.
\end{align}
Next, a couple of observations:
\begin{lemma}
\label{sinfacts}
$\frac{\sin(2\pi x)}{x}=\frac{2\pi\sqrt{1-t_1^2}}{\arccos(t_1)}$ is concave in $t_1$.\\
Also, $\frac{u}{\sin(2\pi u)}$ is decreasing in $t_2$. 
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
Let $\phi(t)=\frac{\sqrt{1-t^2}}{\arccos{t_1}}$. 
Then
\[
\phi''(t)=-\frac{(-2 + 2 t^2 + t \sqrt{1 - t^2}\arccos(t) + \arccos(t)^2)}{((1 - t^2)^{
  3/2}\arccos(t)^3)}.
\]
Since the denominator is positive, it suffices to show positivity of the numerator for $t\in[-1,1]$. Equivalently, letting $y=\arccos[t]$, $y\in[0,\pi]$, we'll show positivity of 
\[
N_1(y):=-2 \sin(y)^2 + \cos(y)\sin(y)y + y^2.
\]
Now $N_1(0)=0$, $N_1'(0)=0$
and $N_1''(y)=4 \sin(y) (-y \cos(y) + \sin(y))\geq0$ since 
$1\geq y\cot(y)$ for $y\in(0,\pi]$ as $y\leq \tan(y)$ for $y\in[0,\pi/2)$ and $y\cot(y)\leq 0$ for $y\in [\pi/2,\pi)$.
So that proves the concavity part of the lemma. Now to get the decreasing part, it suffices to show $\frac{u}{\sin(u)}$ is increasing in $u$ for $u\in [0,\pi]$.
We have
\[
\left(\frac{u}{\sin( u)}\right)'=(1 - u \cot( u))\csc( u)\geq 0 
\]
since $1\geq u \cot( u)$ for $u\in [0,\pi]$ (identical to what we just showed with $y$ instead of $u$).
\end{proof}
Returning to the proof, we have 
\begin{align}
L_1\geq \frac{3u(1-\epsilon)\sin(2\pi x)}{(1+\epsilon)x\sin(2\pi u)}-\frac{\frac{\partial \tg}{\partial t_2}}{\frac{\partial \tg}{\partial t_1}}&=\frac{3u(1-\epsilon)\sin(2\pi x)}{(1+\epsilon)x\sin(2\pi u)}-\frac{b_{0,1}+b_{0,2}(t_1+2t_2)}{b_{1,0}+b_{0,2}t_2}\\ 
&=\frac{3u(1-\epsilon)\sin(2\pi x)}{(1+\epsilon)x\sin(2\pi u)}-\left(2+\frac{\tfo(-1)\tft(1/2)-\tfo(1)\tft(-1/2)+b_{0,2}t_1}{b_{1,0}+b_{0,2}t_2}\right)
\end{align}
where the second equality follows directly from the definitions of the $b_{i,j}$ constants.
By the concavity observation and the linearity of $\frac{\frac{\partial \tg}{\partial t_2}}{\frac{\partial \tg}{\partial t_1}}$ in $t_1$, it suffices to show check that this lower bound for $L_1$ is positive for $t_1=0,1$ as opposed to all $t_1\in[0,1]$. We'll also be using the bound developed in the proof of bounding $a_{1,0}$ in Lemma \ref{abounds} that 
\[
e^{-a/3}(1-3\epsilon) \leq \tfo(-1)\tft(1/2)-\tfo(1)\tft(-1/2)\leq e^{-a/3}(1+6\epsilon)
\]
\\
If $t_1=1$, then 
\begin{align}
\frac{\tfo(-1)\tft(1/2)-\tfo(1)\tft(-1/2)+b_{0,2}t_1}{b_{1,0}+b_{0,2}t_2}
%&=\frac{b_{0,1}+b_{0,2}(1+2t_2)}{b_{1,0}+b_{0,2}t_2}\\
&=
\frac{\tfo(-1)\tft(1/2)-\tfo(1)\tft(-1/2)+b_{0,2}}{b_{1,0}+b_{0,2}t_2}\\
&\leq \frac{1+6\epsilon +e^{a/3}b^{u}_{0,2}}{e^{a/3}(b^{l}_{1,0}+t_2b^{u}_{0,2})}\\
%&=\frac{1+4\epsilon +\frac49((3+3\epsilon)y-2+\epsilon+\delta)}{-1/2-2\epsilon+(1-\epsilon)y+\frac49((3+3\epsilon)y-2+2\epsilon+\delta)t_2}.
\end{align} 
Technically, this lower bound requires that $e^{a/3}(b^{l}_{1,0}+t_2b^{u}_{0,2})>0$ for all $t_2\in [-\frac12,0]$, but this quantity is linear in $a$ so it's easy to check (see the notebook).   
Thus, for $-1/2 \leq t_2\leq 0$,
\[
L_1\geq \frac{3u(1-\epsilon)2\pi}{(1+\epsilon)\sin(2\pi u)}-2-
\frac{1+6\epsilon +e^{a/3}b^{u}_{0,2}}{e^{a/3}(b^{l}_{1,0}+t_2b^{u}_{0,2})}
\]
and
we claim the last is decreasing in $a$, from which it would follow that it suffices to check that the bound is at least 0 only when $a=9.6$ (as the other terms have no dependence on $a$).

To that end, note that as a function of 
$a$
\[
\frac{1+5\epsilon +e^{a/3}b^{u}_{0,2}}{e^{a/3}(b^{l}_{1,0}+t_2b^{u}_{0,2})}
\]%$\frac{1+4\epsilon +\frac49(3+3\epsilon)y-2+2\epsilonlon+\delta)}{-1/2-2\epsilon+(1-\epsilon)y+\frac49(3+3\epsilon)y-2+2\epsilonlon+\delta)t_2}$ 
is rational (with numerator and denominator both linear) and so the sign of its derivative is independent of $a$. We check in the mathematica notebook that indeed it is decreasing in $a$. 
%\begin{align}
%&(1+5\epsilon +e^{a/3}b^{u}_{0,2})'(e^{a/3}(b^{l}_{1,0}+t_2b^{u}_{0,2}))-(1+5\epsilon +e^{a/3}b^{u}_{0,2})(e^{a/3}(b^{l}_{1,0}+t_2b^{u}_{0,2}))'\\
%&=\frac19 (-7 + 4 \delta (-1 + e) + \epsilon^2 (17 - 60 t_2) - 12 t_2 - 2 \epsilon (47 + 36 t_2))\\
%&\leq1/9 (-1 + 4 \delta (-1 + e) - 58\epsilon + 47 \epsilon^2)\\
%&\leq \frac19(-1+47\epsilon^2)<0
%\end{align}

%where he have plugged in $t_2=-\frac12$ because the quantity is clearly decreasing in $t_2$.

In sum, $L_1(1,t_2)\geq 0$ when $t_2\in[-1/2,0]$ if 
\[
\frac{3u(1-\epsilon)2\pi}{(1+\epsilon)\sin(2\pi u)}-2-
\frac{1+5\epsilon +e^{a/3}b^{u}_{0,2}}{e^{a/3}(b^{l}_{1,0}+t_2b^{u}_{0,2})}\geq 0
\]
%\frac{1+4\epsilon +\frac49((3+3\epsilon)y-2+\epsilon+\delta)}{-1/2-2\epsilon+(1-\epsilon)y+\frac49((3+3\epsilon)y-2+2\epsilon+\delta)t_2}\geq 0 
for $a=9.6$. 
(The $x$ terms have disappeared as we took the limit $x\rightarrow0$)\\

(In terms of verifying this with computer, BOTH TERMS ARE INCREASING IN $u$).\\

The case where $t_1=0$ is more simple. Here we again use 
\begin{align}
L(0,t_2)&\geq 
\frac{3u(1-\epsilon)\sin(2\pi x)}{(1+\epsilon)x\sin(2\pi u)}-\left(2+\frac{\tfo(-1)\tft(1/2)-\tfo(1)\tft(-1/2)+b_{0,2}t_1}{b_{1,0}+b_{0,2}t_2}\right)\\
&=\frac{12u(1-\epsilon)}{(1+\epsilon)\sin(2\pi u)}-\left(2+\frac{\tfo(-1)\tft(1/2)-\tfo(1)\tft(-1/2)}{b_{1,0}+b_{0,2}t_2}\right)\\
&\geq\frac{12u(1-\epsilon)}{(1+\epsilon)\sin(2\pi u)}-\left(2+\frac{1+6\epsilon}{e^{a/3}(b^{l}_{1,0}+b^{u}_{0,2}t_2)}\right)
\end{align}
and with the definitions of $b^l_{1,0}$ and $b^u_{0,2}$ this quantity is clearly increasing in $a$ and so it suffices to check when $a=9.6$ (the denominator is positive and increasing in a). Again, (In terms of verifying this with computer, BOTH TERMS ARE INCREASING IN $u$).\\

 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsubsection{Log Derivative Estimates for the proof of Lemma \ref{logderivlemma}}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
It remains to show:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $N(-1/2)<0$
    \item $L_2(-\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2},0)\geq0$
    \item $L_2(0,-\frac15)\geq 0$
\end{enumerate}
\begin{proof}
\begin{align}
N(-1/2)&=b_{0,0}b_{0,2}-b_{0,1}b_{1,0}+\frac{b_{0,2}}{2}(2b_{1,0}-\frac12b_{0,2})\\
&=b_{0,2}(b_{0,0}-\frac14b_{0,2}+b_{1,0})-b_{0,1}b_{1,0}\\
&=b_{0,2}(a_{0,0}+b_{1,0})-b_{0,1}b_{1,0}\\
&\leq b^{u}_{0,2}(a^{u}_{0,0}+b^{u}_{1,0})-b^{l}_{0,1}b^{l}_{1,0}\\
%&=e^{-2a/3}\left[\frac49(-2+2\epsilon+\delta +\frac{(3+3\epsilon)a}{\sqrt{3}\pi})(\frac{(3+3\epsilon)}{2}-1/2+2\epsilon+\frac{(1+\epsilon)a}{\sqrt{3}\pi} )-\frac{(2-\epsilon)a}{\sqrt{3}\pi}(-1/2-2\epsilon +\frac{(1-\epsilon)a}{\sqrt{3}\pi})\right]\\
%&=e^{-2a/3}\bigg[ (\frac{a}{\sqrt{3}\pi})^2((4/3+4/3\epsilon)(1+\epsilon)-(2-\epsilon)(1-\epsilon)))\\
%&+\frac{a}{\sqrt{3}\pi}(\frac49(1+\epsilon)(-2+2\epsilon+\delta)+ (4/3+4/3\epsilon)(1+7/2\epsilon)-(2-\epsilon)(-1/2-2\epsilon)\\
%&+\frac49(-2+2\epsilon+\delta)(1+7/2\epsilon)
%\bigg]
\end{align}
Now this last quantity is quadratic in $a$, concave down, along with negative and decreasing for $a$, as shown in the notebook.\\

Next, we show $L_2\geq 0$ at the two points in the lemma. 
Using lemmas \ref{basicderivs} and \ref{basicvalues}, we have
\begin{align}
L_2(t_1,t_2)&=\frac{\tfo(t_1)}{\tfo'(t_1)}-t_1-\frac{b_{0,0}+b_{0,1}t_2+b_{0,2}t_2^2}{b_{1,0}+b_{0,2}t_2}\\
&\geq \frac{e^{-a x^2}}{a x e^{-ax^2}/(\pi \sin(2\pi x)}-t_1-\frac{b_{0,0}+b_{0,1}t_2+b_{0,2}t_2^2}{b_{1,0}+b_{0,2}t_2}\\
&=\frac{\pi \sin(2\pi x)}{a x}-t_1-\frac{e^{a/3}(b_{0,0}+b_{0,1}t_2+b_{0,2}t_2^2)}{e^{a/3}(b_{1,0}+b_{0,2}t_2)}. 
\end{align}
Thus, the following implies that $L_2\geq 0$
\[
\pi \sin(2\pi x)(e^{a/3}(b_{1,0}+b_{0,2}t_2))-t_1 a x e^{a/3}(b_{1,0}+b_{0,2}t_2)- a x e^{a/3}(b_{0,0}+b_{0,1}t_2+b_{0,2}t_2^2)
\geq 0
\]
and this is easy to handle because it's  quadratic in $a$ once we input the corresponding bounds. For example, when $t_1=0,t_2=-\frac15$, we obtain
\begin{align}
    &\pi \sin(2\pi x)e^{a/3}(b_{1,0}+b_{0,2}t_2)-t_1 a x e^{a/3}(b_{1,0}+b_{0,2}t_2)- a x e^{a/3}(b_{0,0}+b_{0,1}t_2+b_{0,2}t_2^2)\\
    &=\pi e^{a/3}(b_{1,0}-\frac15b_{0,2})- a/4 e^{a/3}(b_{0,0}-\frac15b_{0,1}+\frac15^2b_{0,2})\\
    &\geq \pi e^{a/3}(b^{l}_{1,0}-\frac15b^{u}_{0,2})- a/4 e^{a/3}(b^{u}_{0,0}-\frac15b^{l}_{0,1}+\frac{1}{25}^2b^{u}_{0,2}),
\end{align}
so to show positivity for $a\geq 9.6$, we show positivity and positive slope for $a=10$ along with positive convexity.

The case where $t_1=-\sqrt{2}/2,t_2=0$ ($x=3/8$) is similar but requires a little more care. 

Unfortunately, the bound 
\[
\frac{\tfo(t_1)}{\tfo'(t_1)}\geq \frac{e^{-a x^2}}{a x e^{-ax^2}/(\pi \sin(2\pi x)}=\frac{\pi \sin(2\pi x)}{a x}
\]
is too coarse to work for all $a\geq 9.6$. Instead, we must use the more precise version of Lemma \ref{basicderivs}, truncating one fewer term of $\tfo$ to obtain 
\begin{align}
\frac{\tfo(t_1)}{\tfo'(t_1)}&\geq 
( e^{-ax^2}+e^{-a(x-1)^2} )
\frac{\pi \sin(2\pi x)}
{ a\left(xe^{-ax^2}+ (x-1)e^{-ax^2}+(x+1)e^{-a(x+1)^2}\right) }\\
&=\frac{\pi \sin(2\pi x)}{a} \frac{1+e^{-a(1-2x)}}{x-(1-x)e^{-a(1-2x)}+(x+1)e^{-a(1+2x)}}.
\end{align}
So for $t_1=-\sqrt{2}/2$, ($x=3/8$) we obtain
\begin{align}
\frac{\tfo(-\sqrt{2}/2)}{\tfo'(-\sqrt{2}/2)}&\geq 
\frac{\pi \sqrt{2}}{2a} \frac{1+e^{-a/4}}{\frac38-\frac58 e^{-a/4}+\frac{11}{8} e^{-7a/4}}\\
&= \frac{4\pi \sqrt{2}}{a}
\frac{1+e^{-a/4}}{3-e^{-a/4}(5-11 e^{-3a/2})}\\
&\geq \frac{4\pi \sqrt{2}}{a}
\frac{1+e^{-a/4}}{3-(5-\epsilon)e^{-a/4}}.
\end{align}
Thus, 
\[
L_2(-\sqrt{2}/2,0)\geq \frac{4\pi \sqrt{2}}{a}
\frac{1+e^{-a/4}}{3-(5-\epsilon)e^{-a/4}}+\sqrt{2}/2-\frac{e^{a/3}b_{0,0}^{u}}{e^{a/3}b_{1,0}^{l}}
\]
which is nonnegative if and only if
\[
4\pi \sqrt{2}(e^{a/3}b^{l}_{1,0})\frac{1+e^{-a/4}}{3-(5-\epsilon)e^{-a/4}}  +\sqrt{2}/2 a (e^{a/3}b^{l}_{1,0})-a(e^{a/3}b^{u}_{0,0}) \geq 0
\]

Now if $9.6 \leq  a\leq c$, then we have the inequality
\begin{align}
\label{L2 inequality}
4\pi \sqrt{2}(e^{a/3}b^{l}_{1,0})\frac{1+e^{-c/4}}{3-(5-\epsilon)e^{-c/4}}   \leq 
4\pi \sqrt{2}(e^{a/3}b^{l}_{1,0})\frac{1+e^{-a/4}}{3-(5-\epsilon)e^{-a/4}}  
\end{align}
since 
\[
\frac{1+e^{-c/4}}{3-(5-\epsilon)e^{-c/4}}
\]
is decreasing in $c$ for $c\geq 9.6$. So it remains to show in the accompanying mathematica document that for every $a\in \R$, there is some choice of $c\geq a$ such that the left hand side of \ref{L2 inequality}, call it $L_3(c)$, is positive. In particular, we do so by showing that for each $i=1,\dots,6$ and the sequence $a_0=9.6,9.8,10,10.2,11,12,\infty=a_6$, we have $L_3(a_i)\geq 0$ for $a\geq a_{i-1}$. 
Each of these checks is easy since $L_3$ is quadratic in $a$. 
\end{proof}

\section{Equivalence of Different Notions of Universal Optimality}
In this section, we prove that the definition of a lattice $\Lambda$ being universally optimal given in the introduction is equivalent to 
that given in \cite{CKMRV_2022}. We will use the language and definitions given after the statement of Theorem \ref{mainThm} in the introduction. 
We'll also need the following classical result from the statistical mechanics literature (cf. \cite{Fisher_1964} or \cite{Lewin_2022}).
\begin{lemma}
\label{basicfisherlemma}
Let $f$ be as above and $\Omega$ a bounded, jordan-measurable set set in $\R^d$ with $\lvert \Omega \rvert =1$. Then for any $\rho>0$ $N_k\rightarrow \infty$ and $\ell_k\rightarrow \infty$ such that $\frac{N_k}{\ell_{k}^d}\rightarrow \rho$, the limit
\[
\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \frac{\mathcal{E}_{f}(N_k, \ell_k \Omega)}{N_k}=C_{f,d,\rho}
\] 
exists and is independent of $\Omega$. 
\end{lemma}
Then we have the following proposition showing the equivalence of the different notions of universal optimality: 
\begin{proposition}
\label{defnequivalences}
Let $\Lambda\subseteq \R^d$ be a lattice of some density $\rho>0$. Then the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item $E_f(\Lambda)\leq E^{l}_f(C)$ for every infinite configuration $C$ of density $\rho$ and every $f:x^2\rightarrow e^{-ax^2}$
    \item For every sublattice $\Phi\subseteq \Lambda$, the configuration $\Lambda \cap \Omega_{\Phi}$ is $\Phi$-universally optimal.
    \item There is some sublattice $\Phi\subseteq \Lambda$ such that $\Lambda \cap \Omega_{m\Phi}$ is $m\Phi$-universally optimal for infinitely many $m\in \mathbb{N}$. 
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
First, we'll prove (1) implies (2). Take $\Lambda$ to be a lattice of density $\rho$ satifsying $E_f(\Lambda)\leq E_f(C)$ for every infinite configuration $C$ of density $\rho$ and every $f:x^2\rightarrow e^{-ax^2}$. Fix $f: x^2 \rightarrow e^{-ax^2}$ for some $a>0$ with $F$ its $\Lambda$-periodization. If $\Phi$ is of index $n$, then for an arbitrary configuration $\omega_n$, we define the $n$-point $\Phi$-periodic configuration $C_n= \omega_n + \Phi$. By assumption $E_{f}(\Lambda)\leq E_{f}(C_n)$. Noting that $\Lambda$ is also an $n$-point $\Phi$-periodic configuration, we apply Proposition \ref{periodictoaverage} to obtain
\begin{align}
E_{F,\Phi}(\Lambda \cap \Omega_{\Phi})&=N E_f(\Lambda)+N \sum_{0\neq v\in \Lambda}f(\lvert v \rvert^2)\\
&\leq N E_f(C_n)+N \sum_{0\neq v\in \Lambda}f(\lvert v \rvert^2)\\
&=E_{F,\Phi}(\omega_n).
\end{align}
Since $a$ and $\omega_n$ were arbitrary, we conclude $\Lambda \cap \Omega_{\Phi}$ is $\Phi$-universally optimal as desired.\\

Clearly (2) implies (3) so it remains to show (3) implies (1). To simplify notation, assume $\Lambda$ is of density 1 and generated by some matrix $V_\Lambda$. Again fix $f: x^2 \rightarrow e^{-ax^2}$ for some $a>0$. Let $\Phi\subseteq \Lambda$ be  of index $I$, generated by some matrix $V_\Phi$, and $\{N_k\}$ be our sequence of scalings for which $\Lambda$ yields an $N_k\Phi$-universally optimal configuration. We will tweak our notation so that $\Omega_\Phi=V[0,1]^d$, ensuring compactness and thus that $\mathcal{E}_f(N,\Omega_\Lambda)$ is actually achieved by the $f$-energy of some multiset. 
By Lemma \ref{basicfisherlemma},
certainly $C_{f,d,1}$ is a lower bound for  $E_f(C)$ for any $C$ of density 1, simply by the definition of average energy. Thus, we just have to show $E_f(\Lambda)\leq C_{f,d,1}$.

By Lemma \ref{periodictoaverage}, applied to the lattices $N_k\Phi$, and the $N_{k}^d I$ point configuration $\omega_{N_{k}^dI}:=\Lambda \cap \Omega_{N_k\Phi}$, we have
\begin{align}
E_f(\Lambda)&=\frac{1}{ IN_{k}^d }\left(E_{f,IN_K\Phi} (\omega_{IN_{k}^d})+ I N_{k}^d\sum_{0\neq v\in IN_k\Phi} f(\vert v \vert^2)\right)\\
&=\frac{E_{f,IN_K\Phi} (\omega_{IN_{k}^d})}{ IN_{k}^d }+ \sum_{0\neq v\in IN_k\Phi} f(\vert v \vert^2)\\
\end{align}

and since 
\[
\lim_{N_k\rightarrow \infty} \sum_{0\neq v\in IN_k\Phi} f(\vert v \vert^2)=0,
\] 
we have 
\[
E_f(\Lambda)=\lim_{N_k \rightarrow \infty}
\frac{E_{f,IN_K\Phi} (\omega_{IN_{k}^d})}{ IN_{k}^d }
\]
Now fix $\epsilon>0$, and let $\theta_k$ be an $IN_k^d$- point configuration in minimizing $f$-energy on (1-$\alpha_k$)$\Omega_{N_k\Phi}$, where 
\[
\alpha_k=\frac{1}{N_k^{\epsilon/(2(d+\epsilon))}}.
\]

Since $\alpha_k\rightarrow 0$, we have by Lemma \ref{basicfisherlemma}
\[
\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \frac{E_f(\theta_k)}{IN_k^d}=C_{f,d,1}. 
\]
By assumption, we also have $E_{f,N_K\Phi} (\omega_{IN_{k}^d}) \leq E_{f,N_K\Phi} (\theta_k)$ for all $N_k$. Thus, if we are able to show that \begin{align}
\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \frac{E_{f,N_K \Phi} (\theta_k)}{IN_k^d}\leq \lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \frac{E_f(\theta_k)}{IN_k^d},
\label{equivalenceinequality}
\end{align}
then we have the inequalities
\[
E_f(\Lambda)=\lim_{N_k \rightarrow \infty}
\frac{E_{f,IN_K\Phi} (\omega_{IN_{k}^d})}{ IN_{k}^d }
\leq
\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \frac{E_{f, N_K \Phi} (\theta_k)}{IN_k^d}
\leq 
\lim_{k\rightarrow \infty} \frac{E_f(\theta_k)}{IN_k^d}
=C_{f,d,1}. 
\]
as desired.
Now since 
\[
E_{f,N_K \Phi} (\theta_k) = E_f(\theta_k) +\sum_{x\neq y \in \theta_k} \sum_{v\neq 0 \in N_k\Phi} f(x-y+v),
\]
it suffices to show $\displaystyle{\sum_{x\neq y \in \theta_k} \sum_{v\neq 0 \in N_k \Phi} f(x-y+v)\in o(N_k^d)}$ as $N_k\rightarrow \infty$ in order to prove \ref{equivalenceinequality}. 




To do so, we note that $f$ satisfies the so-called \textit{weakly tempered inequality} (cf. \cite{Fisher_1964}), that is, there exist some $\epsilon, R_0, c>0, $ such that for any two $N_1,N_2$ point configurations $\mu_{N_1}-\{x_1,\dots,x_{N_1}\}, \mu_{N_2}=\{ x'_1,\dots, x'_{N_2} \}$, which are separated by distance at least $R\geq R_0$, we have 
\[
2\sum_{i=1}^{N_1}\sum_{j=1}^{N_2}f(\vert x_i-x'_j\vert^2) \leq \frac{N_1N_2c}{R^{d+\epsilon}} .
\]
In other words, the interaction energy between the two sets decays like $R^{d+\epsilon}$.



When $N_k$ is large enough, we can apply the weakly tempered inequality to the sets $\theta_k$ and $\theta_k+v$ for each $v\neq 0 \in N_k \Phi$. \\

We claim that there exists some $m>0$ such that for all $v\in N_k \Phi$,
\[
d(\theta_k, \theta_k+v) \geq \frac{m}{(IN_k)^{\epsilon/2}} \lVert v\rVert.
\]
To see why, let $S=[0,1]^d$, and note that if $\phi$ is the map with 
matrix representation $V_\Phi=[v_1,\dots v_d]$, then
for all $k\in \N$
and $v=b_1v_1+\dots b_dv_d\in \Phi$,   we have
\begin{align}
\theta_k&\subseteq \phi((1-\alpha_k)S)\\
\theta_k+v&\subseteq \phi((1-\alpha_k)S+b).
\end{align}
where $b=[b_1,...,b_d]^T\in \Z^d$
Now for $x \in (1-\alpha_k)S, y\in (1-\alpha_k)S+b$,

\begin{align}
\lvert x-y\rvert& \geq \lVert x-y\rVert_{\infty}\geq \max_{i=1,...,d} \vert b_i \vert -(1-\alpha_k) \\
&\geq \max_{i=1,...,d} \alpha_k\vert b_i \vert= \alpha_k \Vert b\Vert_\infty
\end{align}

 Now applying the bi-lipschitz property of $\phi$ and equivalence of norms on $\R^d$, we have for some $m_1,m_2,m_3>0$
\[
d(\theta_k,\theta_k+v) 
\geq 
m_1d( (1-\alpha_k)S, (1-\alpha_k)S+b)
\geq 
m_1\alpha_k \Vert b \Vert_{\infty}
\geq 
m_1m_2 \alpha_k\Vert v \Vert_{\infty}
\geq 
m_1m_3m_2\alpha_k \lvert v\rvert . 
\]

Thus, 
\[
d(\theta_k,\theta_k+v) \geq m_1m_2m_3 \alpha_k\lvert v \rvert=  m  \lvert v \rvert {N_k^{\epsilon/2}}=\frac{m \lvert v \rvert }{N_k^{\epsilon/2(d+\epsilon)}}
\]
as desired. Returning to 
$\displaystyle{\sum_{x\neq y \in C_{N_k}} \sum_{v\neq 0 \in N_k \Phi} f(x-y+v)}$
for $k$ large enough, we can use the weakly tempered definition to obtain:  
\begin{align}
\sum_{x\neq y \in \theta_k} \sum_{v\neq 0 \in N_k \Phi} f(\vert x-y+v\vert^2) 
&=
\sum_{v\neq 0 \in N_k \Phi}
\sum_{x\in \theta_k}
\sum_{y\in \theta_k+v/\{ x+v\}}  f(\vert x-y\rvert^2)\\ 
&\leq 
\sum_{v\neq 0 \in N_k \Phi}
\sum_{x\in \theta_k}
\sum_{y\in \theta_k+v}  f(\vert x-y\rvert^2) \\ 
&\leq \sum_{x\neq y \in C_{N_k}} \sum_{v\neq 0 \in N_k \Phi} N_k^{2d} c/d(\theta_k,\theta_k+v)^{d+\epsilon}\\
&\leq \sum_{v\neq 0 \in N_k \Phi} 
\frac{N_k^{2d} c
N_k^{\epsilon/2}}{(m\lvert v \rvert)^{d+\epsilon}}\\
&=\frac{c N_k^{(2d+\epsilon/2)}}{m^{d+\epsilon}}\sum_{v\neq 0 \in N_k \Phi} \frac{1}{\lvert v \rvert^{d+\epsilon}}\\
&=\frac{c N_k^{(2d+\epsilon/2)}}{m^{d+\epsilon}}\sum_{v\neq 0 \in  \Phi} \frac{1}{\lvert N_k v \rvert^{d+\epsilon}}\\
&=\frac{c N_k^{(2d+\epsilon/2)}}{m^{d+\epsilon}N_k^{d+\epsilon}}\sum_{v\neq 0 \in  \Phi} \frac{1}{\lvert v \rvert^{d+\epsilon}}\\
&=\frac{c N_k^{(d-\epsilon/2)}}{m^{d+\epsilon}}\sum_{v\neq 0 \in  \Phi} \frac{1}{\lvert v \rvert^{d+\epsilon}}\\
\end{align}
and this last quantity is of order $o(N_k^d)$ since the sum converges and no term but $N_k^{d-\epsilon/2}$ depends on $k$.  We should note we treat $y\in \theta_k+v/ \{ x+v\}$  in the multiset sense, decreasing the cardinality of $x+v$ in $\theta_k+v$ by one. The proof is complete.
