  "abstract": "The intrinsically superconducting Dirac semimetal 2M-WS$_{2}$ is a promising candidate to realize proximity-induced topological superconductivity in its protected surface states. A precise characterization of the bulk superconducting state is essential for understanding the nature of surface superconductivity in the system. Here, we perform a detailed experimental study of the temperature and nonmagnetic disorder dependence of the London penetration depth $λ$, the upper critical field $H_{c2}$, and the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ in 2M-WS$_{2}$. We observe a power-law dependence $λ(T) - λ(0) \\propto T^{3}$ at temperatures below $0.35~T_c$, which is remarkably different from the expected exponential attenuation of a fully gapped isotropic $s$-wave superconductor. We then probe the effect of controlled nonmagnetic disorder induced by 2.5 MeV electron irradiation at various doses and find a significant $T_c$ suppression rate. Together with the observed increase of the slope $dH_{c2}/dT|_{T=T_c}$ with irradiation, our results reveal a strongly anisotropic $s^{++}$ multiband superconducting state that takes the same sign on different Fermi sheets. Our results have direct consequences for the expected proximity-induced superconductivity of the topological surface states.",
