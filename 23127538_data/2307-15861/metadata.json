  "abstract": "In this work, the notions of normal cones at infinity to unbounded sets and limiting and singular subdifferentials at infinity for extended real value functions are introduced. Various calculus rules for these notions objects are established. A complete characterization of the Lipschitz continuity at infinity for lower semi-continuous functions is given. The obtained results are aimed ultimately at applications to diverse problems of optimization, such as optimality conditions, coercive properties, weak sharp minima and stability results.",
