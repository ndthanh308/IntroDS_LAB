\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
% Our work proposes a new method to enhance out-of-trajectory driving view synthesis by incorporating commonly used map priors in autonomous driving scenes into neural radiance fields. To prevent the training process from collapsing due to the gap between map priors (semantic level) and neural radiance fields (pixel level), we explicitly model the uncertainty in map priors and propose an uncertainty tempering scheme to guide the process.
% According to experimental results, the proposed method not only improves the semantic consistency of out-of-trajectory views, but also enhances the rendering quality of novel view trajectory interpolation. Our method can be integrated into most existing NeRF approaches with ease and has the potential to extend to other types of priors thanks to the uncertainty parameter.
% In the future, we plan to investigate further into incorporating perception algorithms in autonomous driving to improve neural radiance fields on-the-fly. These may include semantic segmentation, lane detection, mapping, and dynamic obstacle in-painting.

This paper proposed a new method to enhance out-of-trajectory driving view synthesis by incorporating commonly used map priors in autonomous driving scenes into neural radiance fields. To prevent the training process from collapsing due to the gap between map priors (semantic level) and neural radiance fields (pixel level), we explicitly model the uncertainty in map priors and propose an uncertainty tempering scheme to guide the process.
The results of our experiment show that our approach not only enhances the semantic consistency of views that deviate from the trajectory, but also improves the rendering quality of interpolating new views. Our method can be easily incorporated into most NeRF methods currently in use, and can be extended to other types of priors with the help of the uncertainty parameter.
Going forward, we aim to explore the incorporation of perception algorithms into self-driving cars, with the goal of enhancing real-time neural radiation fields. This could encompass various techniques such as semantic segmentation, lane detection, mapping, and dynamic obstacle in-painting.
