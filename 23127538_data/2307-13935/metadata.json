  "abstract": "The difference variational bicomplex, which is the natural setting for systems of difference equations, is constructed and used to examine the geometric and algebraic properties of various systems. Exactness of the bicomplex gives a coordinate-free setting for finite difference variational problems, Euler--Lagrange equations and Noether's theorem. We also examine the connection between the condition for existence of a Hamiltonian and the multisymplecticity of systems of partial difference equations. Furthermore, we define difference multimomentum maps of multisymplectic systems, which yield their conservation laws. To conclude, we demonstrate how multisymplectic integrators can be comprehended even on non-uniform meshes through a generalized difference variational bicomplex.",
