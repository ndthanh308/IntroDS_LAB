  "abstract": "Blockchain technologies open new opportunities for media copyright management. To provide an overview of the main initiatives in this blockchain application area, we have first reviewed the existing academic literature. The review shows literature is still scarce and immature in many aspects, which is more evident when comparing it to initiatives coming from the industry. Blockchain has been receiving significant inflows of venture capital and crowdfunding, which have boosted its progress in many fields, including its application to media management. Consequently, we have complemented the review with a business perspective. Existing reports about blockchain and media have been studied and consolidated into four prominent use cases. Moreover, each one has been illustrated through existing businesses already exploring them. Combining the academic and industry perspectives, we provide a more general and complete overview of current trends in media copyright management using blockchain technologies.",
