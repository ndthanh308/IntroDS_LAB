  "abstract": "CATASTROAGRI is an application developed to load, analyze and interactively visualize relevant data on catastrophic agricultural insurance. It also focuses on the analysis of an ARIMA (0,1,1) (0,1,1) model to identify and estimate patterns in the agricultural data of the Puno Region, it presents a decreasing trend because there is a significant relationship between successive values of the time series, We can also state that it is not stationary because the mean and variance do not remain constant over time and the series has periods, and it is observed that the cases are decreasing and increasing over the years, especially the amount to indemnify due to the behavior of the climate in the highlands. The results of the analysis show that agricultural insurance plays an important role in protecting farmers against losses caused by adverse climatic events. The importance of concentrating resources and indemnities on the most affected crops and in the provinces with the highest agricultural production is emphasized. The results of the users' evaluation showed a high level of satisfaction, as well as ease of use.",
