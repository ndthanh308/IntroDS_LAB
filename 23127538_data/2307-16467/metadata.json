  "abstract": "In this paper, we present a cosmology-independent method to constrain cosmological models from the latest 221 gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) sample, including 49 GRBs from Fermi catalog with the Amati relation (the $E_{\\rm p}$-${E}_{\\rm iso}$ correlation), which are calibrated by using a Gaussian process from the Pantheon+ type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) sample. With 182 GRBs at $0.8\\le z\\le8.2$ in the Hubble diagram and the latest observational Hubble data (OHD) by the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, we obtained $Ω_{\\rm m}$ = $0.348^{+0.048}_{-0.066}$ and $h$ = $0.680^{+0.029}_{-0.029}$ for the flat $Λ$CDM model, and $Ω_{\\rm m}$ = $0.318^{+0.067}_{-0.059}$, $h$ = $0.704^{+0.055}_{-0.068}$, $w$ = $-1.21^{+0.32}_{-0.67}$ for the flat $w$CDM model. These results are consistent with those in which the coefficients of the Amati relation and the cosmological parameters fitted simultaneously.",
