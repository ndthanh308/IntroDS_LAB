Recently, integrating video foundation models and large language models to build a video understanding system overcoming the limitations of specific pre-defined vision tasks. Yet, existing systems can only handle videos with very few frames. For long videos, the computation complexity, memory cost, and long-term temporal connection are the remaining challenges. Inspired by Atkinson-Shiffrin memory model, we develop an memory mechanism including a rapidly updated short-term memory and a compact thus sustained long-term memory. We employ tokens in Transformers as the carriers of memory. MovieChat achieves state-of-the-art performace in long video understanding.
