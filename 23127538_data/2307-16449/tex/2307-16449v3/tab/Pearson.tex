\caption{Pearson correlation coefficient of GPT-3.5~\cite{gpt3.5}, Claude~\cite{examplewebpage}, and human blind rating on score. We calculate the mean score across each score dimensions for MovieChat and previous methods~\cite{maaz2023video,li2023videochat,zhang2023llama, zhang2023video}, and then computes the Pearson correlation between these means for each pair of evaluation methods. The Pearson correlation coefficient, which ranges from -1 to +1, indicates a stronger positive linear relationship between the two sets of data when the coefficient is higher (closer to +1).}
