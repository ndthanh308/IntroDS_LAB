   \item Statements of the full set of assumptions of all theoretical results. \\
     \textbf{\textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}}. See the theorem statements and \cref{section:preliminaries}
   \item Complete proofs of all theoretical results. \\
     \textbf{\textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}}. See \cref{section:proofs}.
   \item Clear explanations of any assumptions. \\
     \textbf{\textcolor{ForestGreen}{Yes}}. See \cref{section:definitions,section:preliminaries} and the main text.
 \end{enumerate}


 \item For all figures and tables that present empirical results, check if you include:
