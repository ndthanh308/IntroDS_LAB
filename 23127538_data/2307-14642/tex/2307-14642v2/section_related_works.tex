\paragraph{Analyzing the Computational Properties of BBVI}
Since its inception by \citet{ranganath_black_2014,titsias_doubly_2014}, theoretical results on BBVI have been developing on two different axes: 
\begin{enumerate*}[label=\textbf{(\alph*)}]
    \item Analyzing the regularity of the ELBO such as convexity and smoothness \citep{challis_gaussian_2013,titsias_doubly_2014}, 
    \item and analyzing the variance of the Monte Carlo gradient estimators \citep{fan_fast_2015,xu_variance_2019,mohamed_monte_2020,buchholz_quasimonte_2018}.
\end{enumerate*}
While some convergence analyses of BBVI have been provided \citep{regier_fast_2017,khan_faster_2016,khan_kullbackleibler_2015,buchholz_quasimonte_2018,liu_quasimonte_2021,alquier_concentration_2020,fujisawa_multilevel_2021,alquier_nonexponentially_2021}, these works \textit{a priori} assumed the regularity of the ELBO and the gradient estimators.
Due to the difficulty of rigorously establishing these conditions, later works by \citet{hoffman_blackbox_2020,bhatia_statistical_2022} have worked with simplified or alternative implementations of BBVI.
Meanwhile, \citet{xu_computational_2022} showed these regularities can be realized asymptotically in high probability.
In expectation, however, it was only recently that regularity conditions on the ELBO~\citep{domke_provable_2020,kim_blackbox_2023} and the reparameterization gradient estimator~\citep{kim_practical_2023,domke_provable_2019} were shown to be realizable under mild conditions without modifying the algorithms used in practice.

\paragraph{Concurrent Results by \citet{domke_provable_2023a}}
While our work builds on top of the QV-based framework of \citet{domke_provable_2023}, a similar convergence result on the STL estimator appeared in its later version~\citep{domke_provable_2023a} concurrently with our work.
However, our results differ in several aspects:
\begin{enumerate}
    \setlength\itemsep{-.5ex}
    \item[\ding{182}] For the family-misspecification term \(T_{\text{\ding{184}}}\) we bound the term using the Fisher-Hyv\"arinen divergence \(D_{\mathrm{F}^4}\left(q_{\vlambda^*}, \pi\right)\), while \citet{domke_provable_2023a} involve the smoothness constant of the residual function \(r\left(\vz\right) \triangleq \log q_{\vlambda^*}\left(\vz\right) - \log \pi\left(\vz\right)\).
    
    \item[\ding{183}] For the Gaussian posterior case, the constants of \cref{thm:stl_upperbound} are tighter that of \citet{domke_provable_2023a} by a factor of \(\times 2\).
    
    \item[\ding{184}] We also provide an upper bound for the mean-field variational family in \cref{thm:stl_upperbound_mf}.
    
    \item[\ding{185}] We establish a lower bound on the gradient variance of STL, quantifying the tightness of the bounds.
\end{enumerate}
