  "abstract": "This study aimed to comprehensively investigate the post-COVID-19 effects on female fertility in patients with a history of severe COVID-19 infection. Data were collected from 340 patients who had previously experienced severe COVID-19 symptoms and sought medical assistance at private clinics and fertility centers in various provinces of Iraq. A comparative control group of 280 patients, who had not contracted COVID-19 or had mild cases, was included. The study assessed ovarian reserve, hormonal imbalances, and endometrial health in the post-recovery phase. The findings revealed a significant decrease in ovarian reserve, hormonal disturbances, and endometrial abnormalities among patients with a history of severe COVID-19 infection compared to the control group. This in-depth investigation sheds light on the potential long-term impacts of severe COVID-19 on female fertility. The results emphasize the need for further research and targeted interventions to support women affected by post-COVID-19 fertility issues. Understanding these effects is crucial for providing appropriate medical care and support to women on their reproductive journey after recovering from severe COVID-19.",
