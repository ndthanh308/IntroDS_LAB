Autonomous systems in the road transportation network require intelligent mechanisms that cope with uncertainty to 
foresee the future. In this paper, we propose a multi-stage probabilistic approach for trajectory forecasting: 
trajectory transformation to displacement space, clustering of displacement time series, trajectory proposals, and 
ranking proposals. We introduce a new deep feature clustering method, underlying self-conditioned GAN, which copes 
better with distribution shifts than traditional methods. 
Additionally, we propose novel distance-based ranking proposals to assign probabilities to the generated trajectories 
that are more efficient yet accurate than an auxiliary neural network. The overall system surpasses context-free deep
generative models in human and road agents trajectory data while performing similarly to point estimators when 
comparing the most probable trajectory.
