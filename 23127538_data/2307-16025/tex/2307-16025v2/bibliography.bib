abstract={Two graphene layers twisted at 0.93{\textdegree} host superconducting and correlated insulating states, expanding the ?magic? range of angles. The emergence of flat bands and correlated behaviors in ?magic angle? twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG) has sparked tremendous interest, though its many aspects are under intense debate. Here we report observation of both superconductivity and the Mott-like insulating state in a tBLG device with a twist angle of {\textasciitilde}0.93{\textdegree}, which is smaller than the magic angle by 15{\%}. At an electron concentration of {\textpm}5 electrons/moir{\'e} unit cell, we observe a narrow resistance peak with an activation energy gap {\textasciitilde}0.1 meV. This indicates additional correlated insulating state, and is consistent with theory predicting a high-energy flat band. At doping of {\textpm}12 electrons/moir{\'e} unit cell we observe resistance peaks arising from the Dirac points in the spectrum. Our results reveal that the ?magic? range of tBLG is in fact larger than what is previously expected, and provide a wealth of new information to help decipher the strongly correlated phenomena observed in tBLG.},

abstract={Superconductivity was recently discovered in rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG) in the absence of a moir{\'e} potential. Superconductivity is observed proximate to a metallic state with reduced isospin symmetry, but it remains unknown whether this is a coincidence or a key ingredient for superconductivity. Using a Hartree-Fock analysis and constraints from experiments, we argue that the symmetry breaking is inter-valley coherent (IVC) in nature. We evaluate IVC fluctuations as a possible pairing glue, and find that they lead to chiral unconventional superconductivity when the fluctuations are strong. We further elucidate how the inter-valley Hund's coupling determines the spin-structure of the IVC ground state and breaks the degeneracy between spin-singlet and triplet superconductivity. Remarkably, if the normal state is spin-unpolarized, we find that a ferromagnetic Hund's coupling favors spin-singlet superconductivity, in agreement with experiments. Instead, if the normal state is spin-polarized, then IVC fluctuations lead to spin-triplet pairing.},

          author = {Sergej Konschuh},
        abstract = {In this Thesis we explain the relatively large splitting in intrinsic graphene by using tight-binding method. We include the relevant \$s\$, \$p\$, and \$d\$ orbitals and obtain the orbital couplings necessary to account for the splitting by fitting the tight-binding model to first-principles alculations. Our formula for the intrinsic splitting shows that while the contribution from the spin-orbit coupling of the \$p\$ orbitals increases with increasing lattice constant (decreasing hopping energy), the contribution from the \$d\$ orbitals decreases. This predicted trend is well confirmed by first-principles calculations. By increasing artificially the lattice constant increases the splitting decreases first, demonstrating the dominance of the \$d\$ orbitals. After reaching a minimum the splitting increases, being dominated by the spin-orbit coupling of the \$p\$ orbitals. We also present explicit formulas for the extrinsic splitting, showing here that the contributions from the \$d\$ orbitals are negligible.
We have found that the physical mechanism for intrinsic spin-orbit coupling in bilayer graphene and other few-layer graphenes is alike in single graphene sheet and in addition manifesting in the band splitting of the same order. The symmetry of the few-layer graphenes structures is reflected in the inter-layer hopping, which consequently influences the shape of the \${$\backslash$}pi\$ bands around the K points. The neighboring inter-layer hopping repels corresponding \${$\backslash$}pi\$ bands away the Fermi-energy leading to  so-called high-energy bands. The low-energy bands at the Fermi energy involve intrinsic spin-orbit coupling splitting as in graphene that are of the same order of 24 micro eV. The splitting is significantly suppressed if the \$d\$ orbitals 
are excluded from the calculations. This coincidence with the spin-orbit coupling induced band gap in the single-layer graphene implies that the spin-orbit coupling effects in few-layer graphenes and graphite have the same physical origin.},

number={1},

abstract={The recent discovery of the Mott insulating and superconducting phases in twisted bilayer graphene has generated tremendous research interest. Here, we develop a weak coupling approach to the superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene, starting from the Fermi liquid regime. A key observation is that near half filling, the fermiology consists of well nested Fermi pockets derived from opposite valleys, leading to enhanced valley fluctuation, which in turn can mediate superconductivity. This scenario is studied within the random phase approximation. We find that inter-valley electron pairing with either chiral (d{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}id mixed with p−ip) or helical form factor is the dominant instability. An approximate SO(4) spin-valley symmetry implies a near degeneracy of spin-singlet and triplet pairing. On increasing interactions, commensurate inter-valley coherence wave (IVCW) order can arise, with simultaneous condensation at the three M points in the Brillouin Zone, and a 2{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}2 pattern in real space. In simple treatments though, this leads to a full gap at fillings{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}(1/2{\thinspace}+{\thinspace}1/8), slightly away from half-filling. The selection of spin-singlet or spin triplet orders, both for the IVCW and the superconductor, arise fcase corresponds to the Hundsrom SO(4) symmetry breaking terms. Mott insulators derived from phase fluctuating superconductors are also discussed, which exhibit both symmetry protected and intrinsic topological orders.},

abstract = {Advances in scaling down heterostructures and having an improved interface quality together with atomically thin two-dimensional materials suggest a novel approach to systematically design materials. A given material can be transformed through proximity effects whereby it acquires properties of its neighbors, for example, becoming superconducting, magnetic, topologically nontrivial, or with an enhanced spin–orbit coupling. Such proximity effects not only complement the conventional methods of designing materials by doping or functionalization but also can overcome their various limitations. In proximitized materials, it is possible to realize properties that are not present in any constituent region of the considered heterostructure. While the focus is on magnetic and spin–orbit proximity effects with their applications in spintronics, the outlined principles also provide a broader framework for employing other proximity effects to tailor materials and realize novel phenomena.}
