\begin{abstract}
Ex-so-tic van der Waals heterostructures take advantage of the electrically tunable layer polarization to swap proximity exchange and spin-orbit coupling in the electronically active region. Perhaps the simplest example is Bernal bilayer graphene (BBG) encapsulated by a layered magnet from one side and a strong spin-orbit material from the other. Taking WS$_2$/BBG/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ as a representative ex-so-tronic device, we employ realistic \emph{ab initio}-inspired Hamiltonians and effective electron-electron interactions to investigate the emergence of correlated phases within the random phase approximation. We find that for a given doping level, exchange and spin-orbit coupling induced Stoner and intervalley coherence instabilities can be swapped, allowing to explore the full spectrum of correlated phases within a single device.

\paragraph{Introduction.} 

While a variety of novel electronic correlation effects have initially been discovered in twisted graphene structures~\cite{Dean2013, Kim2016, Cao2018_1, Cao2018_2}, recent demonstrations of quarter and half-metallic states~\cite{Zhou2021_1, PhysRevB.105.L081407, PhysRevB.106.155115, PhysRevB.107.L121405, arxiv.2305.04950, Geisenhof2021} and superconductivity~\cite{Zhou2021_2, PhysRevLett.127.187001, PhysRevLett.127.247001, PhysRevB.105.134524, Chatterjee2022, PhysRevB.106.155115, PhysRevB.105.075432, arxiv.2203.09083} in rhombohedral trilayer graphene, as well as the observation of isospin magnetism and spin-polarized superconductivity in Bernal bilayer graphene (BBG)~\cite{Zhou2022, Zhang2023, Seiler2022, PhysRevB.105.L100503, delaBarrera2022, arxiv.2303.00742, PhysRevB.105.L201107, PhysRevB.106.L180502, PhysRevB.107.L201119}, are a clear evidence for correlated physics without moiré patterns. The common feature, boosting the electron-electron interactions in these systems, is the presence of van Hove singularities (vHS) near the charge neutrality point~\cite{Li2009, Bistritzer2011, PhysRevB.82.035409}. Particularly attractive is the tunability of the correlated phases by a displacement field, which can shift the electronic levels of the vHS.~\cite{Zhou2021_1, Zhou2021_2, Zhou2022, Zhang2023}.

The electronic states of 2D materials in van der Waals heterostructures can be also affected by proximity effects~\cite{Sierra2021}. Relatively strong spin interactions, for example, can be induced in materials such as graphene which exhibits weak spin-orbit coupling~\cite{PhysRevB.80.235431, PhysRevB.85.115423, PhysRevB.82.245412}. Indeed, proximity-induced spin-orbit (SO) and exchange (EX) interactions have been predicted theoretically~\cite{Gmitra2013, PhysRevB.99.085411, PhysRevB.104.195156, Gmitra2015, Gmitra2016, PhysRevB.104.075126, PhysRevLett.125.196402, PhysRevB.105.115126, PhysRevB.94.155441, PhysRevB.77.115406, Kochan2017, PhysRevB.104.075126, PhysRevLett.125.196402, PhysRevB.105.115126, ZollnerTwist} and confirmed experimentally~\cite{Garcia2018, Island2019, Hoque2021, Ghiasi2017, Ghiasi2019, Safeer2019, Herling2020, Wakamura2019, Wakamura2020, InglaAyns2021, Kaverzin2022, Karpiak2019} in BBG-based heterostructures. Specifically, valley-Zeeman, Kane-Mele, and Rashba SO couplings have been shown to emerge~\cite{Gmitra2013, Garcia2018, Island2019, Hoque2021, Ghiasi2017, Ghiasi2019, Safeer2019, Herling2020, Wakamura2019, Wakamura2020, InglaAyns2021, Kaverzin2022, PhysRevB.99.085411,PhysRevB.104.195156, Gmitra2015, Gmitra2016, PhysRevB.104.075126, PhysRevLett.125.196402, Gmitra2013, PhysRevB.105.115126}, along with (anti)ferromagnetic EX couplings~\cite{ZollnerTwist, PhysRevB.94.155441, PhysRevB.77.115406, PhysRevB.99.195452, PhysRevB.104.075126, PhysRevLett.125.196402, PhysRevB.105.115126, Kaverzin2022,Karpiak2019, ZollnerTwist}, typically causing spin splittings on the meV scale. 

Perhaps the most striking manifestation of the proximity effects is the possibility to swap the spin couplings, EX and SO, by a displacement field, whereby changing the spin Hamiltonian in the active layer. This effect arises due to the interplay of the short-range proximity interactions and layer polarization by the field. An experimentally relevant materials system to consider is that of BBG encapsulated from one side by a strong spin-orbit material, such as WS$_2$, and a magnetic semiconductor, such as Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ (CGT), from the other side. The resulting heterostructure, termed ex-so-tic~\cite{PhysRevLett.125.196402}, allows to imprint selectively either SO or EX coupling onto the Bloch states of the BBG.  

Given that BBG can host correlated phases, is it possible to swap between the phases induced be EX and SO coupling? As we show here, ex-so-tronic devices can indeed supply on-demand correlated phases, allowing to swap the effective single-particle excitation Hamiltonians enabled by the layer polarization effect. Although our conclusions are more general, we specifically study WS$_2$/BBG/CGT, for which an effective orbital and spin-interaction Hamiltonian has been derived from DFT~\cite{PhysRevB.104.075126, PhysRevLett.125.196402}. Employing random-phase approximation (RPA)~\cite{PhysRev.82.625, PhysRev.85.338, PhysRev.92.609, PhysRevLett.101.087004, Graser2009, PhysRevB.83.100515}, we first examine the particle-hole instabilities of pristine BBG, whose correlated phase diagram features intervalley coherence (IVC) ~\cite{PhysRevLett.103.216801} and Stoner instabilities~\cite{PhysRevB.105.134524, Chatterjee2022}. The spin interactions induced by proximity SO (see the latest works  ~\cite{PhysRevB.107.L201119,wang2023electrical,koh2023correlated,zhumagulov2023emergent}) and EX couplings remove the spin and valley degeneracies of IVC and Stoner phases and cause a plethora of emergent spin-valley correlated phases. In ex-so-tic heterostructures, such as in here employed WS$_2$/BBG/CGT, the phases can be effectively swapped, while the evidence of the interplay of SO and EX interactions can be seen in the single-particle (Hartee-Fock) excitation spectra which we also calculate. 

%=================================================================================================================

\paragraph{Model.} The orbital degrees of freedom of BBG are modeled by a realistic Bloch Hamiltonian~\cite{PhysRevB.85.115423, PhysRevLett.125.196402}:
\begin{equation}
\centering
    \hat{h}_0(\mathbf{k},\tau)\
=\begin{pmatrix}
  \Delta+V & \gamma_0 f(\mathbf{k})&\gamma_4 f^{*}(\mathbf{k})&\gamma_1 \\ 
  \gamma_0 f^{*}(\mathbf{k}) & +V&\gamma_3 f(\mathbf{k})&\gamma_4 f^{*}(\mathbf{k})\\
  \gamma_4 f(\mathbf{k})&\gamma_3 f^{*}(\mathbf{k})&-V&\gamma_0 f(\mathbf{k})\\
  \gamma_1&\gamma_4 f(\mathbf{k})&\gamma_0 f^{*}(\mathbf{k})&\Delta-V\\
\end{pmatrix}
\label{eq:kin-ham}
\end{equation}
in the basis of $p_z$ orbitals ordered as ($A_1, B_1, A_2, B_2$). Parameters $\gamma$
denote intra- ($\gamma_0$) and interlayer ($\gamma_1$, $\gamma_3$, $\gamma_4$) hoppings, see
Figs.~\ref{fig:scheme}~(b)~and~(c). 
Displacement field is accounted for by on-site energy $V$, while the asymmetry between A and B sublattice
is quantified by $\Delta$. Momenta $\mathbf{k}=(k_x, k_y)$ are measured from $K$ and $K'$ valleys, while, 
$f(\mathbf{k})=-\left(\sqrt{3}a/2\right)\left(\tau_x-ik_y\right)$ is the linearized nearest-neighbor tight-binding function; $a=2.46\,\AA$ is graphene's lattice constant and $\tau=\tau_{K/K'}=\pm1$ is the valley index. Since the SO coupling of pristine BBG is weak---about $24~\mu$eV~\cite{PhysRevB.85.115423}---we do not include it in the Hamiltonian.

To model proximitized BBG in a WS$_2$/BBG/CGT ex-so-tic heterostructure 
we need to include SO (due to WS$_2$) and EX (due to CGT) couplings, which were shown 
by \emph{ab initio} calculations and weak-antilocalization measurements~\cite{PhysRevB.105.115425} to be sizeable, on the order of 1~meV~\cite{PhysRevB.104.075126, PhysRevLett.125.196402}. The corresponding proximity induced spin interactions are described
near $K$ and $K'$ valleys by the Hamiltonian $\hat{h}_{\text{prox}}(\tau)=\sum_{l} \hat{h}^{l}_{\text{vz}}(\tau)+\hat{h}^{l}_{\text{ex}}(\tau)$, for valley-Zeeman (vz) spin-orbit and exchange (ex) coupling ~\cite{PhysRevB.105.115126, Gmitra2016,Kochan2017,Gmitra2013}:
\begin{align}
    \hat{h}^{l}_{\text{vz}}(\tau)&= \begin{pmatrix}
        \tau\,\lambda_{\text{vz}}^{A_l}\,s_z&0\\
        0&-\tau\,\lambda_{\text{vz}}^{B_l}\,s_z
    \end{pmatrix},\\
    \hat{h}^{l}_{\text{ex}}(\tau)&= \begin{pmatrix}
        -\lambda_{\text{ex}}^{A_l}\,s_z&0\\
        0&-\lambda_{\text{ex}}^{B_l}\,s_z
    \end{pmatrix},
    \label{eq:prox}
\end{align}
parameterized by the corresponding sublattice and layer-resolved couplings $\lambda^{A_l/B_l}_{\text{vz}}$ 
and $\lambda^{A_l/B_l}_{\text{ex}}$.
We denote by $s_{z}$ the spin Pauli matrix. Each $\hat{h}^l$ is a $4\times 4$ matrix in the spin-sublattice resolved basis $(A_{l\uparrow},A_{l\downarrow},B_{l\uparrow},B_{l\downarrow})$ within layer $l$ (bottom is $l=1$,
top $l=2$). Since spin-orbit coupling in graphene induced
by TMDCs is of the valley-Zeeman type \cite{Gmitra2015}, we set $\lambda^{A_l}_{\text{vz}} \approx 
-\lambda^{B_l}_{\text{vz}}$. 

The numerical values for the parameters of the single-particle Hamiltonian, 
$\hat{h}(\textbf{k},\tau)=\hat{h}_0(\textbf{k},\tau) + \hat{h}_{\text{prox}}(\tau)$,
are taken from the \emph{ab initio} results of Ref.~\cite{PhysRevLett.125.196402}.
The calculated
low-energy band dispersions for WS$_2$/BBG/CGT are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:scheme}(c).  
The signs of $V$ and electron doping $n_e$ determine the dominant proximity 
spin interaction. If both $V$ and $n_e$ positive or negative, the electrons at the Fermi level
experience proximity exchange coupling, while if the the signs of $V$ and $n_e$ are opposite, 
the electrons at the Fermi level have strong proximity spin-orbit coupling; we use labels (SO) 
and (EX) in Fig.~\ref{fig:scheme}(c) and below when needed to keep track of the dominant spin interaction.

To investigate correlation phenomena we introduce the many-particle Hamiltonian
operator as the sum of the kinetic and potential energies 
$\hat{H}=\hat{H}_{\text{kin}}+\hat{H}_{\text{int}}$, where
%%%
\begin{align}
    \hat{H}_{\text{kin}}&=\sum_{\textbf{k}\tau s,ij}
    \hat{c}^{\dagger}_{s\tau i}(\textbf{k})
    \left[ \hat{h}(\mathbf{k},\tau) - \mu\right]_{si,s'j}\hat{c}_{s'\tau j}(\textbf{k}),
    \label{eq:kin}\\
    %%%
    \hat{H}_{\text{int}}&=U_0\left(\hat{n}_{\uparrow K}\,\hat{n}_{\downarrow K}+\hat{n}_{\uparrow K^{\prime}}\,\hat{n}_{\downarrow K^{\prime}}\right)+
    U_1 \hat{n}_{K}\,\hat{n}_{K^{\prime}}.
    \label{eq:int}
\end{align} 
%%%
Here, $\hat{c}^{(\dagger)}_{s\tau i}(\textbf{k})$ 
is the annihilation (creation) operator for a Bloch electron with spin $s=\uparrow\hspace{-1.22mm}/\hspace{-1.22mm} \downarrow$ in valley $\tau={K/K^\prime}$ on BBG sublattice $i$ with valley-momentum $\textbf{k}$; $\mu$ is the chemical potential. 
The intra- and intervalley density interactions are described by repulsive (positive) couplings $U_0$ and $U_1$, respectively, while $\hat{n}_{s\tau}=\sum_{|\textbf{k}|<k_{c}}\sum_{i}\hat{c}^{\dagger}_{s\tau i}(\textbf{k})\hat{c}^{\phantom{\dagger}}_{s\tau i}(\textbf{k})$ stands for the spin-valley number operator in the $s\tau$-channel cut-off by a momentum $k_{c}$; the valley number operator then is 
$\hat{n}_{\tau}=\hat{n}_{\uparrow\tau}+\hat{n}_{\downarrow\tau}$. 


In the following, we consider SU(4)-symmetric interactions by setting 
$U_0 = U_1 = U=19$~eV~\cite{You2019, PhysRevB.105.134524, zhumagulov2023emergent}, and $k_{c}=0.06~\AA^{-1}$, which are consistent with the experimental pristine BBG phase diagram~\cite{Zhou2022, Zhang2023}. We use the same interaction parameters for the WS$_2$/BBG/CGT heterostructure. 
%===============================================================================================

\paragraph{Methodology.} To resolve the correlated phases of our models of pristine and proximitized BBG we employ the RPA. First, we evaluate the non-interacting generalized static Lindhard's susceptibility, $\chi^{0}$,~\cite{PhysRevLett.101.087004, Graser2009, PhysRevB.83.100515,supplemental} using the BBG Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_{\text{kin}}$, Eq.~(\ref{eq:kin}), at 0.4~K, considering 
different spin-valley modes $s\tau$ in the particle-hole channel. 
Second, we calculate the dressed susceptibility, $\chi=\left[1-\chi^{0}\Gamma\right]^{-1}\chi^{0}$, where $\Gamma$ is the irreducible vertex function corresponding to $\hat{H}_{\text{int}}$, Eq.~(\ref{eq:int}). 
Finally, we check for divergence of $\chi$: If the highest eigenvalue $\lambda_c$ of $\chi^{0}\Gamma$ becomes greater or equal to unity, a correlated phase corresponding to that eigenvalue emerges. 

In particular, we find all possible correlated phases $\hat{\Phi}$ of different spin-valley channels by first diagonalizing $\chi^{0}\Gamma$ at $\mu = 0$ and $V = 0$. 
Then, varying the doping and displacement field, we compute the corresponding $\chi^{0}$ and $\chi^{0}\Gamma$. For each $\hat{\Phi}$ found above we estimate the critical parameter $\lambda_c(\hat{\Phi})=\langle\hat{\Phi}|\chi^{0}\Gamma|\hat{\Phi}\rangle/{\lVert \hat{\Phi} \rVert^2}$. The dominant instability is realized by phase $\hat{\Phi}$ that at given
$\mu$ and $V$ has the highest $\lambda_c(\hat{\Phi})$. 
Each symmetry-breaking phase $\hat{\Phi}$ can be expressed in terms of $\hat{c}^{(\dagger)}_{s\tau i}(\textbf{k})$ operators,
\begin{equation}
\hat{\Phi}=\sum_{|\mathbf{k}|<k_c}\sum_{i} \hat{c}^\dagger_{s\tau i}(\mathbf{k})\,\left[\,M_\Phi\,\right]_{s\tau,s'\tau'}\,\hat{c}^{\phantom{\dagger}}_{s'\tau' i}(\mathbf{k}),   
\end{equation}
where the 
spin-valley resolved matrices $M_\Phi$ that are relevant for our model are listed in Table~\ref{tab}.
However, at the phase boundaries, 
the dominant phase can be unresolved due to the degeneracy of several $\lambda_c(\hat{\Phi})$.

Figure~\ref{fig:free} displays the obtained correlated phase diagram of pristine BBG. We
find IVC and Stoner instabilities, as also reported earlier~\cite{PhysRevB.105.134524, Chatterjee2022}. While the Stoner instability is local, the IVC state corresponds to a phase spatially
modulated by wave vector $\mathbf{q}=(2\pi/3a)(1,\sqrt{3})$ which connects $K$ and $K^\prime$ valleys. 
The fact that $\hat{H}_{\text{kin}}$ lacks particle-hole symmetry is reflected in the
different phases for the electron and hole doping ranges. Both IVC and Stoner phases exhibit degeneracies, as listed in Table I, due to not fully broken spin-valley symmetries.


Figure~\ref{fig:exc} shows the main result of the paper. There, we plot the correlated phase diagram of 
WS$_2$/BBG/CGT for different doping levels and displacement fields. Compared with the pristine 
case, the phase diagram of proximitized BBG is rather rich.  
Indeed, if the Fermi level crosses bands experiencing strong proximity SO coupling, 
the Stoner phase breaks up into two SVP$_{\pm}$ 
states---both displaying spin-valley polarization along the $\pm z$ direction---while IVC splits into 
spin-valley coherent states SVC$_{\pm}$. 
Resolving specific spin-valley states within the Stoner and IVC phases is attributed to the
valley-Zeeman SO coupling~\cite{Gmitra2015}. 
Similarly, if the Fermi level lies in bands which have strong EX coupling, 
the Stoner phase evolves into valley-polarized states, VP$_{\pm}$, while IVC 
is split into charge density waves, CDW$_{\pm}$. The multitude of spin-valley-split 
phases of proximitized BBG due to SO and EX interactions is summarized in Table~\ref{tab},
including the explicit forms of the phase operators $\hat{\Phi}$. 
Their expectation values in the corresponding ground states can serve as the conventional order parameters discriminating different phases. 


Let us take a closer look at vHS. If the singularity is split due to the valley-Zeeman
SO coupling, two SVC$_{\pm}$ phases 
appear. As the corresponding $M_{\text{SVC}_{\pm}}$ contain spin $s_x$ and $s_y$ matrices, 
and valley $\tau_x$ and $\tau_y$ matrices,
they can be described as inter-valley spin-flip hopping that retains the spin-valley quantum number,
i.e., the product of $s \tau$. Say, spin up at $K$ is degenerate with spin down at $K'$. Coupling the two enabled by 
the Coulomb interaction lowers the kinetic energy, resulting in an SVC correlated phase. 
Similarly, when vHS are split by EX interaction, two spin-polarized CDW$_{\pm}$ phases form up. Contrary to SVC$_{\pm}$, $M_{\text{CDW}_{\pm}}$ does not mixes spins---it involves $s_0$ and $s_z$ spin matrices---but similarly as SVC$_{\pm}$ it intertwines the valleys---matrix $\tau_x$. 
Because of that both SVC$_{\pm}$ and CDW$_{\pm}$ possess spatial modulations governed 
by wave vector $\mathbf{q}=\tfrac{2\pi}{3a}(1,\sqrt{3})$; the correlations 
effectively enlarge the BBG unit cell into a ``magnetic'' $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$-unit cell. As a consequence, the Brillouin zone gets smaller, while both valleys fold into the $\Gamma$ point. 
In what follows the $\mathbf{k}$ vector is measured with respect to the centre of such 
the reduced Brillouin zone. 

Finally, to find the effective single-particle excitation energies of the correlated phases
of our WS$_2$/BBG/CGT model we employ the Hartree-Fock (HF) method and solve the following eigen-problem:
\begin{align}
\left(\hat{H}_{\text{kin}}+\hat{\Sigma}\right)|\Tilde{u}_n(\mathbf{k})\rangle=\Tilde{\varepsilon}_{n\textbf{k}}|\Tilde{u}_n(\mathbf{k})\rangle,
\end{align}
where $\Tilde{\varepsilon}_{n\textbf{k}}$ and $|\Tilde{u}_n(\mathbf{k})\rangle$ are HF-corrected quasi-particle energies and wave-functions labelled by the band index $n$ and the $\mathbf{k}$-vector in the reduced Brillouin zone. Correspondingly, $\hat{\Sigma}$, represents the HF self-energy which mixes spin and valley indices, for details see~\cite{supplemental}.

To illustrate how our ex-so-tic heterostructure enables to swap two correlated phases, one induced
by valley-Zeeman SO and the other by EX coupling, we consider
one particular doping level, namely hole density $n_e=-0.183\cdot10^{12}$~cm$^{-2}$. At positive $V= 18.5$~meV, the most stable correlated phase (largest $\lambda_c$ and largest critical temperature) is a spin-valley coherence SVC$_{-}$. This phase arises due to the proximity spin-orbit coupling from WS$_2$, and couples the opposite spins at the two valleys. 
It is characterized by the flat band states close to the Fermi level exhibiting reduced spin polarization, which is not exactly zero because of the residual proximity exchange. 
Flipping the direction of the displacement field 
to $V=- 18.5$~meV, a different correlated phase emerges, CDW$_-$, in which the states at the Fermi level 
are fully spin-polarized, due to the proximity exchange from CGT. 

In Fig. \ref{fig:fermi} we also show the markedly different quasi-particle Fermi contours of the two swappable phases SVC$_{-}$ and CDW$_{-}$. To make this visualization, 
we plotted thermally broadened density of states (derivative of the Fermi-Dirac function) at $T=0.4$\,K:
\begin{equation}
    \rho_{n\textbf{k}}=-\frac{d f(\varepsilon)}{d\varepsilon}\Bigl|_{\Tilde{\varepsilon}_{n\textbf{k}}}=\frac{1}{k_BT} \left[4\cosh\left(\frac{\Tilde{\varepsilon}_{n\textbf{k}}- \mu}{2k_BT}\right)\right]^{-2}.
\end{equation}

Inspecting Fig.~\ref{fig:fermi} we see that the quasi-particle band structures for the two considered phases, and also the shapes of their Fermi contours demonstrate very pronounced spectral asymmetries 
at the corresponding Fermi levels. 
However, regions with more smeared portions of the Fermi surface (different from just contour plots) are 
visible in the centre of the reduced Brillouin zone.

Knowing the HF self-energies $\hat{\Sigma}$ we are able to estimate the magnitudes of the associated correlated gaps, 
$\Delta_{\hat{\Phi}}=
\sum_{s\tau,s'\tau'}\hat{\Phi}^{*}_{s'\tau',s\tau}
\hat{\Sigma}_{s\tau,s'\tau'}
/{\lVert \hat{\Phi} \rVert^2}$.
This yields for the considered SVP$_{-}$ and CDW$_{-}$ phases the following values: 
%for the band structure shown in the Figure \ref{fig:fermi}. 
$\Delta_{\text{SVP}_{-}}=0.109$~meV and $\Delta_{\text{CDW}_{-}}=0.085$~meV. 

To model an interacting system with a symmetry-broken phase at a self-consistent mean-field level, one can factorize $\hat{H}_{\text{int}}$, Eq.~(\ref{eq:int}), in terms of accessible $\hat{\Phi}$'s and for a given dominant phase approximate the interaction just by $\hat{H}_{\Delta}=\Delta_{\hat{\Phi}}\hat{\Phi}$.
For example, for a SVC$_{\pm}$ phase, one explores an effective Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_{\text{kin}}+\Delta_{\text{SVC}_{\pm}}\hat{\Phi}_{\text{SVC}_{\pm}}$
which promotes spin-flip-valley-flip hopping due to the interplay of intervalley electron-electron interactions and the valley-Zeeman SO coupling. Such a phase enables novel spin interactions and
is expected to result in new phenomena in spintronics \cite{RevModPhys.76.323}. 
In turn, a CDW$_{\pm}$ phase can be treated on the mean-field level by
$\hat{H}_{\text{kin}}+\Delta_{\text{CDW}_{\pm}}\hat{\Phi}_{\text{CDW}_{\pm}}$
which gives rise to spatial modulations of the already spin-split bands due to the proximity-induced 
EX interaction. 

\paragraph{Conclusion.} By performing realistic calculations at the RPA level, and by computing Hartree-Fock excitation spectra, we predict that the correlated states of ex-so-tic heterostructures
based on BBG can be swapped between SO and EX-driven phases. A single device can exhibit the full spectrum
of correlated phases, from uniform Stoner valley polarized, to spatially modulated spin-polarized CDW and 
spin-flip-valley-flip spin-valley coherences. 
While we specifically consider the DFT parametrization of one stacking of WS$_2$/BBG/CGT, 
our findings are more general, valid for twisted structures with modified proximity spin interactions, as well as for different encapsulating spin-orbit materials and magnetic semiconductors/insulators.
