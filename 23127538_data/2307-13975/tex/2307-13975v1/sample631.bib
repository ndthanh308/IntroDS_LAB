  abstract      = {We have generated synthetic images of {\ensuremath{\sim}}27 000 galaxies         from the IllustrisTNG and the original Illustris hydrodynamic         cosmological simulations, designed to match Pan-STARRS         observations of log$_{10}$(M$_{*}$/M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$)         {\ensuremath{\approx}} 9.8-11.3 galaxies at z         {\ensuremath{\approx}} 0.05. Most of our synthetic images were         created with the SKIRT radiative transfer code, including the         effects of dust attenuation and scattering, and performing the         radiative transfer directly on the Voronoi mesh used by the         simulations themselves. We have analysed both our synthetic and         real Pan-STARRS images with the newly developed statmorph code,         which calculates non-parametric morphological diagnostics -         including the Gini-M$_{20}$ and concentration-asymmetry-         smoothness statistics - and performs 2D S{\'e}rsic fits.         Overall, we find that the optical morphologies of IllustrisTNG         galaxies are in good agreement with observations, and represent         a substantial improvement compared to the original Illustris         simulation. In particular, the locus of the Gini-M$_{20}$         diagram is consistent with that inferred from observations,         while the median trends with stellar mass of all the         morphological, size and shape parameters considered in this work         lie within the {\ensuremath{\sim}}1{\ensuremath{\sigma}} scatter         of the observational trends. However, the IllustrisTNG model has         some difficulty with more stringent tests, such as producing a         strong morphology-colour relation. This results in a somewhat         higher fraction of red discs and blue spheroids compared to         observations. Similarly, the morphology-size relation is         problematic: while observations show that discs tend to be         larger than spheroids at a fixed stellar mass, such a trend is         not present in IllustrisTNG.},

We reduced the NIRCam imaging with the JWST         Calibration Pipeline, with custom modifications and reduction         steps designed to address additional features and challenges         with the data. Here we provide a detailed description of each         step in our reduction and a discussion of future expected         improvements. Our reduction process includes corrections for         known pre-launch issues such as 1/f noise, as well as in-flight         issues including snowballs, wisps, and astrometric alignment.         Many of our custom reduction processes were first developed with         pre-launch simulated NIRCam imaging over the full 10 CEERS         NIRCam pointings. We present a description of the creation and         reduction of this simulated dataset in the Appendix. We provide         mosaics of the real images in a public release, as well as our         reduction scripts with detailed explanations to allow users to         reproduce our final data products.

  abstract      = {A major problem in extragalactic astronomy is the inability to         distinguish in a robust, physical, and model-independent way how         galaxy populations are physically related to each other and to         their formation histories. A similar, but distinct, and also         long-standing question is whether the structural appearances of         galaxies, as seen through their stellar light distributions,         contain enough physical information to offer this         classification. We argue through the use of 240 images of nearby         galaxies that three model-independent parameters measured on a         single galaxy image reveal its major ongoing and past formation         modes and can be used as a robust classification system. These         parameters quantitatively measure: the concentration (C),         asymmetry (A), and clumpiness (S) of a galaxy's stellar light         distribution. When combined into a three-dimensional ``CAS''         volume all major classes of galaxies in various phases of         evolution are cleanly distinguished. We argue that these three         parameters correlate with important modes of galaxy evolution:         star formation and major merging activity. This is argued         through the strong correlation of H{\ensuremath{\alpha}}         equivalent width and broadband colors with the clumpiness         parameter S, the uniquely large asymmetries of 66 galaxies         undergoing mergers, and the correlation of bulge to total light         ratios, and stellar masses, with the concentration index. As an         obvious goal is to use this system at high redshifts to trace         evolution, we demonstrate that these parameters can be measured,         within a reasonable and quantifiable uncertainty with available         data out to z\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde3 using the Hubble         Space Telescope GOODS ACS and Hubble Deep Field images.},

  abstract      = {We present two new nonparametric methods for quantifying galaxy         morphology: the relative distribution of the galaxy pixel flux         values (the Gini coefficient or G) and the second-order moment         of the brightest 20\% of the galaxy's flux (M$_{20}$). We test         the robustness of G and M$_{20}$ to decreasing signal-to-noise         ratio (S/N) and spatial resolution and find that both measures         are reliable to within 10\% for images with average S/N per         pixel greater than 2 and resolutions better than 1000 and 500         pc, respectively. We have measured G and M$_{20}$, as well as         concentration (C), asymmetry (A), and clumpiness (S) in the         rest-frame near-ultraviolet/optical wavelengths for 148 bright         local ``normal`` Hubble-type galaxies (E-Sd) galaxies, 22 dwarf         irregulars, and 73 0.05<z<0.25 ultraluminous infrared galaxies         (ULIRGs). We find that most local galaxies follow a tight         sequence in G-M$_{20}$-C, where early types have high G and C         and low M$_{20}$ and late-type spirals have lower G and C and         higher M$_{20}$. The majority of ULIRGs lie above the normal         galaxy G-M$_{20}$ sequence because of their high G and M$_{20}$         values. Their high Gini coefficients arise from very bright         nuclei, while the high second-order moments are produced by         multiple nuclei and bright tidal tails. All of these features         are signatures of recent and on-going mergers and interactions.         We also find that in combination with A and S, G is more         effective than C at distinguishing ULIRGs from the ``normal''         Hubble types. Finally, we measure the morphologies of         491.7<z<3.8 galaxies from HST NICMOS observations of the Hubble         Deep Field North. We find that many of the         z\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde2 galaxies possess G and A         higher than expected from degraded images of local elliptical         and spiral galaxies and have morphologies more like low-redshift         ULIRGs.},

For the James Webb Space         Telescope, the WebbPSF program provides a PSF simulation tool in         a flexible and easy-to-use software package available to the         community and implemented in Python. The latest version of         WebbPSF adds new support for spectroscopic modes of JWST NIRISS,         MIRI, and NIRSpec, including modeling of slit losses and         diffractive line spread functions. It also provides additional         options for modeling instrument defocus and/or pupil         misalignments. The software infrastructure of WebbPSF has         received enhancements including improved parallelization, an         updated graphical interface, a better configuration system, and         improved documentation. We also present several comparisons of         WebbPSF simulated PSFs to observed PSFs obtained using JWST's         flight science instruments during recent cryovac tests.         Excellent agreement to first order is achieved for all imaging         modes cross-checked thus far, including tests for NIRCam, FGS,         NIRISS, and MIRI. These tests demonstrate that WebbPSF model         PSFs have good fidelity to the key properties of JWST's as-built         science instruments.},

Galaxy morphologies were characterized using non-parametric         statistics (Gini, M$_{20}$, Concentration, and Asymmetry)         derived from mock images computed using a 3D radiative transfer         technique and post-processed to approximate observational         surveys. The resulting morphologies were contrasted to         observational results from a sample of log         \_\{10\}(M\_\{*\}/\{M\}\_{\ensuremath{\odot}}) > 10 galaxies at         z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0.05 in the GAMA survey. We find that the         morphologies of EAGLE galaxies reproduce observations, except         for asymmetry values which are larger in the simulated galaxies.         Additionally, we study the effect of spatial resolution in the         computation of non-parametric morphologies, finding that Gini         and Asymmetry values are systematically reduced with decreasing         spatial resolution. Gini values for lower mass galaxies are         especially affected. Comparing against other large-scale         simulations, the non-parametric statistics of EAGLE galaxies         largely agree with those found in ILLUSTRISTNG. Additionally,         EAGLE galaxies mostly reproduce observed trends between         morphology and star formation rate and galaxy size. Finally, We         also find a significant correlation between optical and         kinematic estimators of morphologies, although galaxy         classification based on an optical or a kinematic criteria         results in different galaxy subsets. The correlation between         optical and kinematic morphologies is stronger in central         galaxies than in satellites, indicating differences in         morphological evolution.},

The         parameters include luminosity, color, and the image-structure         parameters: size, image concentration, asymmetry, and surface         brightness. Based on an initial calibration of this parameter         space using the ``normal`` Hubble types surveyed in 1996 by Frei         et al., we find that only a subset of the parameters provide         useful classification boundaries for this sample. Interestingly,         this subset does not include distance-dependent scale parameters         such as size or luminosity. The essential ingredient is the         combination of a spectral index (e.g., color) with parameters of         image structure and scale: concentration, asymmetry, and surface         brightness. We refer to the image structure parameters         (concentration and asymmetry) as indices of ``form.'' We define         a preliminary classification based on spectral index, form, and         surface brightness (a scale) that successfully separates normal         galaxies into three classes. We intentionally identify these         classes with the familiar labels of early, intermediate, and         late. This classification, or others based on the above four         parameters, can be used reliably to define comparable samples         over a broad range in redshift. The size and luminosity         distribution of such samples will not be biased by this         selection process except through astrophysical correlations         between spectral index, form, and surface brightness.},

  abstract      = {We present the results of a 42-orbit Hubble Space Telescope Wide-Field         Camera 3 (HST/WFC3) survey of the rest-frame optical         morphologies of star-forming galaxies with spectroscopic         redshifts in the range z = 1.5-3.6. The survey consists of 42         orbits of F160W imaging covering         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde65 arcmin$^{2}$ distributed         widely across the sky and reaching a depth of 27.9 AB for a         5{\ensuremath{\sigma}} detection within a 0.2 arcsec radius         aperture. Focusing on an optically selected sample of 306 star-         forming galaxies with stellar masses in the range M $_{*}$ =         {}10$^{9}$-{}10$^{11}$ M $_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$, we find that         typical circularized effective half-light radii range from         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.7 to 3.0 kpc and describe a         stellar mass-radius relation as early as z         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 3. While these galaxies are         best described by an exponential surface brightness profile         (S{\'e}rsic index n \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 1), their         distribution of axis ratios is strongly inconsistent with a         population of inclined exponential disks and is better         reproduced by triaxial stellar systems with minor/major and         intermediate/major axis ratios         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.3 and 0.7, respectively. While         rest-UV and rest-optical morphologies are generally similar for         a subset of galaxies with HST/Advanced Camera for Surveys         imaging data, differences are more pronounced at higher masses M         $_{*}$ > 3 {\texttimes} {}10$^{10}$ M $_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$.         Finally, we discuss galaxy morphology in the context of efforts         to constrain the merger fraction, finding that morphologically         identified mergers/non-mergers generally have insignificant         differences in terms of physical observables such as stellar         mass and star formation rate, although merger-like galaxies         selected according to some criteria have statistically smaller         effective radii and correspondingly larger         {\ensuremath{\Sigma}}$_{SFR}$.

  abstract      = {We present an investigation into the first 500 Myr of galaxy evolution         from the Cosmic Evolution Early Release Science (CEERS) survey.         CEERS, one of 13 JWST ERS programs, targets galaxy formation         from z\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.5 to z>10 using several         imaging and spectroscopic modes. We make use of the first epoch         of CEERS NIRCam imaging, spanning 35.5 sq. arcmin, to search for         candidate galaxies at z>9. Following a detailed data reduction         process implementing several custom steps to produce high-         quality reduced images, we perform multi-band photometry across         seven NIRCam broad and medium-band (and six Hubble broadband)         filters focusing on robust colors and accurate total fluxes. We         measure photometric redshifts and devise a robust set of         selection criteria to identify a sample of 26 galaxy candidates         at z\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde9-16. These objects are         compact with a median half-light radius of         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.5 kpc. We present an early         estimate of the z\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde11 rest-frame         ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function, finding that the number         density of galaxies at M\_UV \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde         -20 appears to evolve very little from         z\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde9 to         z\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde11. We also find that the         abundance (surface density [arcmin\^-2]) of our candidates         exceeds nearly all theoretical predictions. We explore potential         implications, including that at z>10 star formation may be         dominated by top-heavy initial mass functions, which would         result in an increased ratio of UV light per unit halo mass,         though a complete lack of dust attenuation and/or changing star-         formation physics may also play a role. While spectroscopic         confirmation of these sources is urgently required, our results         suggest that the deeper views to come with JWST should yield         prolific samples of ultra-high-redshift galaxies with which to         further explore these conclusions.},

  abstract      = {We describe a new program for determining photometric redshifts, dubbed         EAZY. The program is optimized for cases where spectroscopic         redshifts are not available, or are only available for a biased         subset of the galaxies. The code combines features from various         existing codes: it can fit linear combinations of templates, it         includes optional flux- and redshift-based priors, and its user         interface is modeled on the popular HYPERZ code. A novel feature         is that the default template set, as well as the default         functional forms of the priors, are not based on (usually highly         biased) spectroscopic samples, but on semianalytical models.         Furthermore, template mismatch is addressed by a novel rest-         frame template error function. This function gives different         wavelength regions different weights, and ensures that the         formal redshift uncertainties are realistic. We introduce a         redshift quality parameter, Q$_{z}$, which provides a robust         estimate of the reliability of the photometric redshift         estimate. Despite the fact that EAZY is not ``trained'' on         spectroscopic samples, the code (with default parameters)         performs very well on existing public data sets. For K-selected         samples in CDF-South and other deep fields, we find a 1         {\ensuremath{\sigma}} scatter in {\ensuremath{\Delta}} z/(1 + z)         of 0.034, and we provide updated photometric redshift catalogs         for the FIRES, MUSYC, and FIREWORKS surveys.},

Observed changes in galaxy structures reveal formation         processes that only galaxy structural analyses can provide. This         pedagogical review provides a detailed discussion of the major         methods used to study galaxies morphologically and structurally,         including the well-established visual method for morphology;         S{\'e}rsic fitting to measure galaxy sizes and surface         brightness profile shapes; and nonparametric structural methods         [such as the concentration (C), asymmetry (A), clumpiness (S)         (CAS) method and the Gini/M$_{20}$ parameters, as well as newer         structural indices]. These structural indices measure         fundamental properties of galaxies, such as their scale, star-         formation rate, and ongoing merger activity. Extensive         observational results demonstrate how broad galaxy morphologies         and structures change with time up to z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 3,         from small, compact and peculiar systems in the distant Universe         to the formation of the Hubble sequence, dominated by spirals         and ellipticals. Structural methods accurately identify galaxies         in mergers and allow measurements of the merger history out to z         {\ensuremath{\sim}} 3. I depict properties and evolution of         internal structures of galaxies, such as bulges, disks, bars,         and at z>1 large star-forming clumps. I describe the structure         and morphologies of host galaxies of active galactic nuclei and         starbursts/submillimeter galaxies, along with how morphological         galaxy quenching occurs. The role of environment in producing         structural changes in galaxies over cosmic time is also         discussed. Galaxy sizes can also change with time, with measured         sizes up to a factor of 2-5 smaller at high redshift at a given         stellar mass. I conclude with a discussion of how the evolving         trends, in sizes, structures, and morphologies, reveal the         formation mechanisms behind galaxies and provides a new and         unique way to test theories of galaxy formation.},

The all-reflective optical chain         of NIRSpec and the performance of its different components are         described, and some of the trade-offs made in designing the         instrument are touched upon. The faint-end spectrophotometric         sensitivity expected of NIRSpec, as well as its dependency on         the energetic particle environment that its two detector arrays         are likely to be subjected to in orbit are also discussed.},

  abstract      = {In this paper we present a new statistic for quantifying galaxy         morphology based on measurements of the Gini coefficient of         galaxy light distributions. This statistic is easy to measure         and is commonly used in econometrics to measure how wealth is         distributed in human populations. When applied to galaxy images,         the Gini coefficient provides a quantitative measure of the         inequality with which a galaxy's light is distributed among its         constituent pixels. We measure the Gini coefficient of local         galaxies in the Early Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky         Survey and demonstrate that this quantity is closely correlated         with measurements of central concentration, but with significant         scatter. This scatter is almost entirely due to variations in         the mean surface brightness of galaxies. By exploring the         distribution of galaxies in the three-dimensional parameter         space defined by the Gini coefficient, central concentration,         and mean surface brightness, we show that all nearby galaxies         lie on a well-defined two-dimensional surface (a slightly warped         plane) embedded within a three-dimensional parameter space. By         associating each galaxy sample with the equation of this plane,         we can encode the morphological composition of the entire SDSS         g*-band sample using the following three numbers: \{22.451,         5.366, 7.010\}. The i*-band sample is encoded as \{22.149,         5.373, and 7.627\}.},

  abstract      = {This paper begins a series in which we examine the structures of distant         galaxies to directly determine the history of their formation         modes. We start this series by examining the structures of         z$_{F850LP}$ < 27 galaxies in the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (UDF),         the deepest high-resolution optical image taken to date. We         investigate a few basic features of galaxy structure using this         image. These include: (1) the agreement of visual eye-ball         classifications and non-parametric quantitative (CAS,         Gini/M$_{20}$) methods; (2) how distant galaxy quantitative         structures can vary as a function of rest-frame wavelength; and         (3) the evolution of distant galaxy structures up to z         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 3. One of our major conclusions         is that the majority of galaxies with z$_{850}$ < 27 are         peculiar in appearance, and that galaxy assembly is rapidly         occurring at these magnitudes, even up to the present time. We         find a general agreement between galaxy classification by eye         and through quantitative methods, as well as a general agreement         between the CAS and the Gini/M$_{20}$ parameters. We find that         the Gini/M$_{20}$ method appears to find a larger number of         galaxy mergers than the CAS system, but contains a larger         contamination from non-mergers. We furthermore calculate the         merger rate of galaxies in the UDF up to z         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 3, finding an increase with         redshift as well as stellar mass, confirming previous work in         the Hubble Deep Field. We find that massive galaxies with         M$_{*}$ > {}10$^{10}$M$_{solar}$ undergo 4.3$^{-0.8}$$_{+0.8}$         major galaxy mergers at z < 3, with all of this merging         occurring at z > 1.},

  abstract      = {This paper presents direct evidence for hierarchical galaxy assembly out         to redshifts z\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde3. We identify         major mergers using the model-independent CAS (concentration,         asymmetry, clumpiness) physical morphological system on galaxies         detected, and photometrically selected, in the WFPC2 and NICMOS         Hubble Deep Field North. We specifically use the asymmetric         distributions of rest-frame optical light measured through the         asymmetry parameter (A) to determine the fraction of galaxies         undergoing major mergers as a function of redshift (z), stellar         mass (M$_{*}$), and absolute magnitude (M$_{B}$). We find that         the fraction of galaxies consistent with undergoing a major         merger increases with redshift for all galaxies, but most         significantly, at 5-10 {\ensuremath{\sigma}} confidence, for the         most luminous and massive systems. The highest merger fractions         we find are 40\%-50\% for galaxies with M$_{B}$<-21, or         M$_{*}$>{}10$^{10}$ M$_{solar}$ at z>2.5, e.g., objects         identified as Lyman-break galaxies. Using these results, we         model the merger fraction evolution in the form f$_{m}$(A,M$_{*}         $,M$_{B}$,z)=f$_{0}${\texttimes}(1+z)$^{m$_{A}$}$. We find         m$_{A}$ values \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde4-6 for the most         luminous and massive galaxies, while lower mass and less         luminous galaxies have smaller m$_{A}$ values. We use these         merger fractions, combined with merger timescales calculated         from N-body simulations, to derive galaxy merger rates to         z\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde3. We also use stellar masses         of HDF-N galaxies to determine the mass accretion rate of field         galaxies involved in major mergers. We find an average stellar         mass accretion rate of         M$_{G}$\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde4{\texttimes}{}10$^{8}$         M$_{solar}$ Gyr$^{-1}$ per galaxy at         z\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde1 for galaxies with stellar         masses M$_{*}$>{}10$^{9}$ M$_{solar}$. This accretion rate         changes with redshift as         M$_{G}$=1.6{\texttimes}{}10$^{8}$(1+z)$^{0.99+/-0.32}$         M$_{solar}$ Gyr$^{-1}$ per galaxy. We also find that the         fraction of stellar mass density in galaxies involved in major         mergers increases with redshift, with a peak mass fraction         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde0.5 for the brightest,         M$_{B}$<-21, and most massive, M$_{*}$>{}10$^{10}$ M$_{solar}$,         systems near z\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde2.5. By comparing         merger fractions predicted in cold dark matter semianalytic         models with our results we find a reasonably good agreement for         the largest and brightest systems, although we find more low-         mass galaxy mergers at lower redshifts than what these models         predict.},

  abstract = {The morphological properties of high-redshift galaxies are investigated         using a sample of 507 objects (I < 22.0 mag) from the Hubble         Space Telescope (HST) Medium Deep Survey. Independent visual         morphological classifications for each galaxy are used to         quantify the statistical uncertainties in the galaxy         classifications. Visual classifications are found to agree well         for I < 21 mag. Fainter than I = 21 mag significant         disagreements are seen in the independent visual classifications         of late-type systems with T > 7, merging systems, and peculiar         galaxies. The classifications of these systems are shown to be         some- what subjective. Objective classifications based upon         measurements of central concentration and asymmetry for the         Medium Deep Survey sample are presented. These classifications         are calibrated using measurements of structural parameters for         an artificially redshifted sample of local objects.         Morphologically segregated number counts using both sets of         visual classifications and objective classifications support the         conclusion that the observed galaxy counts agree with no-         evolution predictions for the elliptical and spiral populations,         as reported in Glazebrook et al. (1995a). A major conclusion is         that the large overdensity of merging/peculiar/irregular         galaxies relative to the predictions of no-evolution models         (reported by Glazebrook et al. 1995a) is confirmed. However, the         shape of the faint-end (I > 21.0 mag) number count relation for         peculiar objects is sensitive to the large systematic         uncertainties inherent in the visual classification of these         objects. Despite this caveat, the frequency of objects showing         clear evidence for tidal interactions (e.g., tidal tails) in the         HST sample is at least 50\% larger than it is among nearby         galaxies, at the 2 {\ensuremath{\sigma}} level. Relatively few         ``chain galaxies'' are seen among the sample of peculiar         objects, suggesting that these systems do not form a large         component of the peculiar galaxy population at I < 22 mag.},

We         use the Gini coefficient and M$_{20}$ to identify major mergers         and classify galaxy morphology for a volume-limited sample of         3009 galaxies brighter than 0.4L$^{*}$$_{B}$, assuming pure         luminosity evolution. We find that the merger fraction remains         roughly constant at 10\% +/- 2\% for 0.2 < z < 1.2. The fraction         of E/S0/Sa galaxies increases from 21\% +/- 3\% at z         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 1.1 to 44\% +/- 9\% at z         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 0.3, while the fraction of Sb-         Ir galaxies decreases from 64\% +/- 6\% at z         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 1.1 to 47\% +/- 9\% at z         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 0.3. The majority of z < 1.2         Spitzer MIPS 24 {\ensuremath{\mu}}m sources with L(IR) >         {}10$^{11}$ L$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ are disk galaxies, and         only \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde15\% are classified as         major merger candidates. Edge-on and dusty disk galaxies (Sb-Ir)         are almost a third of the red sequence at z         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 1.1, while E/S0/Sa make up over         90\% of the red sequence at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde         0.3. Approximately 2\% of our full sample are red mergers. We         conclude (1) the merger rate does not evolve strongly between         0.2 < z < 1.2; (2) the decrease in the volume-averaged star         formation rate density since z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde         1 is a result of declining star formation in disk galaxies         rather than a disappearing population of major mergers; (3) the         build-up of the red sequence at z < 1 can be explained by a         doubling in the number of spheroidal galaxies since z         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 1.2.},

We compare the distributions of the Gini         coefficient (G), the second-order moment of the brightest 20\%         of galaxy light (M$_{20}$), and concentration (C) for high- and         low-redshift galaxies with average signal-to-noise ratios per         pixel >2.5 and Petrosian radii >0.3''. Ten of the 82 LBGs have         M$_{20}$>=-1.1 and possess bright double or multiple nuclei,         implying a major-merger fraction of star-forming galaxies         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde10\%-25\% at M$_{FUV}$<-20,         depending on our incompleteness corrections.

The star-forming z\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde1.5 galaxy         sample has a morphological distribution that is similar to the         UDF z\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde4 LBGs, with an identical         fraction of major-merger candidates but fewer spheroids. The         observed morphological distributions are roughly consistent with         current hierarchical model predictions for the major-merger         rates and minor-merger-induced starbursts at         z\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde1.5 and         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde4. We also examine the rest-         frame FUV-NUV and FUV-B colors as a function of morphology and         find no strong correlations at either epoch.},

  abstract = {This contribution gives the results of a statistical investigation of         400 extragalactic nebulae for which Holetschek has determined         total visual magnitudes. The list is complete for the brighter         nebulae in the northern sky and is representative to 12.5 mag.         or fainter. The classification employed is based on the forms of         the photographic images. About 3 per cent are irregular, but the         remaining nebulae fall into a sequence of type forms         characterized by rotational symmetry about dominating nuclei.         The sequence is composed of two sections, the elliptical nebulae         and the spirals, which merge into each other. Luminosity         relations. - The distribution of magnitudes appears to be         uniform throughout the sequence. For each type or stage in the         sequence, the total magnitudes are related to the logarithms of         the maximum diameters by the formula, m$_{T}$ = C - 5 log d,         where C varies progressively from type to type, indicating a         variation in diameter for a given magnitude or vice versa. By         applying corrections to C, the nebulae can be reduced to a         standard type and then a single formula expresses the relation         for all nebulae from the Magellanic Clouds to the faintest that         can be classified. When the minor diameter is used, the value of         C is approximately constant throughout the entire sequence. The         coefficient of log d corresponds with the inverse-square law,         which suggests that the nebulae are all of the same order of         absolute luminosity and that apparent magnitudes are measures of         distance. This hypothesis is supported by similar results for         the nuclear magnitudes and the magnitudes of the brightest stars         involved, and by the small range in luminosities among nebulae         whose distances are already known. Distances and absolute         dimensions. - The mean absolute visual magnitude, as derived         from the nebulae whose distances are known, is -15.2. The         statistical expression for the distance in parsecs is then log D         = 4.04 + 0.2 m$_{T}$. where m$_{T}$ is the total apparent         magnitude. This leads to mean values for absolute dimensions at         various stages in the sequence of types. Masses appear to be of         the order of 2.6x{}10$^{8}$ M$_{sun}$. Distribution and density         of space. - To apparent magnitude about 16.7, corresponding to         an exposure of one hour on fast plates with the 60-inch         reflector, the numbers of nebulae to various limits of total         magnitude vary directly with the volumes of space represented by         the limits. This indicates an approximately uniform density of         space, of the order of one nebula per {}10$^{17}$ cubic parsecs         or 1.5x10$^{-31}$ in C.G.S. units. The corresponding radius of         curvature of the finite universe of general relativity is of the         order of 2.7x{}10$^{10}$ parsecs, or about 600 times the         distance at which normal nebulae can be detected with the         100-inch reflector.},

We         exploit deep, high-resolution, NIRCAM seven-band observations to         take a first look at the morphology of galaxies in the epoch of         reionization (z > 7), and its variation in the rest-frame         wavelength range between Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} and 6000-4000         {\r{A}}, at z = 7-12. We find no dramatic variations in         morphology with wavelength-of the kind that would have         overturned anything we have learned from the Hubble Space         Telescope. No significant trends between morphology and         wavelengths are detected using standard quantitative morphology         statistics. We detect signatures of mergers/interactions in 4/19         galaxies. Our results are consistent with a scenario in which         Lyman-break galaxies-observed when the universe is only 400-800         Myr old-are growing via a combination of rapid, galaxy-scale         star formation supplemented by the accretion of star-forming         clumps and interactions.},

Galaxies were selected         to be more massive than {}10$^{10}$ M $_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$         and have specific star formation rates (SFRs) above 1/t$_{H}$ .         We model the seven-band optical ACS + near-IR WFC3 spectral         energy distributions of individual bins of pixels, accounting         simultaneously for the galaxy-integrated photometric constraints         available over a longer wavelength range. We analyze variations         in rest-frame color, stellar surface mass density, age, and         extinction as a function of galactocentric radius and local         surface brightness/density, and measure structural parameters on         luminosity and stellar mass maps. We find evidence for redder         colors, older stellar ages, and increased dust extinction in the         nuclei of galaxies. Big star-forming clumps seen in star         formation tracers are less prominent or even invisible in the         inferred stellar mass distributions. Off-center clumps         contribute up to \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde20\% to the         integrated SFR, but only 7\% or less to the integrated mass of         all massive SFGs at z \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 1 and z         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 2, with the fractional         contributions being a decreasing function of wavelength used to         select the clumps. The stellar mass profiles tend to have         smaller sizes and M20 coefficients, and higher concentration and         Gini coefficients than the light distribution. Our results are         consistent with an inside-out disk growth scenario with brief         (100-200 Myr) episodic local enhancements in star formation         superposed on the underlying disk. Alternatively, the young ages         of off-center clumps may signal inward clump migration, provided         this happens efficiently on the order of an orbital timescale.},

  abstract      = {We have obtained spectra with the 10 m Keck telescope of a sample of 24         galaxies having colors consistent with star-forming galaxies at         redshifts 2 <\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde z         <\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 4.5 in the Hubble deep field         (HDF). Eleven of these galaxies are confirmed to be at high         redshift (z$_{med}$ = 3.0), one is at z = 0.5, and the other 12         have uncertain redshifts but have spectra consistent with their         being at z > 2. The spectra of the confirmed high-redshift         galaxies show a diversity of features, including weak         Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} emission, strong Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}}         breaks or damped Ly{\ensuremath{\alpha}} absorption profiles,         and the stellar and interstellar rest-UV absorption lines common         to local starburst galaxies and high-redshift star-forming         galaxies reported recently by others. The narrow profiles and         low equivalent widths of C IV, Si IV, and N V absorption lines         may imply low stellar metallicities. Combined with the five         high-redshift galaxies in the HDF previously confirmed with Keck         spectra by Steidel et al. (1996a), the 16 confirmed sources         yield a comoving volume density of n >= 2.4 {\texttimes}         10$^{-4}$ h$^{3}$$_{50}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ for q$_{0}$ = 0.05, or n >=         1.1 {\texttimes} 10$^{-3}$ h$^{3}$$_{50}$ Mpc$^{-3}$ for q$_{0}$         = 0.5. These densities are 3-4 times higher than the recent         estimates of Steidel et al. (1996b) based on ground-based         photometry with slightly brighter limits and are comparable to         estimates of the local volume density of galaxies brighter than         L$^{*}$. The high-redshift density measurement is only a lower         limit and could be almost 3 times higher still if all 29 of the         unconfirmed candidates in our original sample, including those         not observed, are indeed also at high redshift. The galaxies are         small but luminous, with half-light radii 1.8 < r$_{1/2}$ < 6.5         h$^{-1}$$_{50}$ kpc and absolute magnitudes -21.5 > M$_{B}$ >         -23. The HST images show a wide range of morphologies, including         several with very close, small knots of emission embedded in         wispy extended structures. Using rest-frame UV continuum fluxes         with no dust correction, we calculate star formation rates in         the range 7-24 or 3-9 h$^{-2}$$_{50}$ M$_{solar}$ yr$^{-1}$ for         q$_{0}$ = 0.05 and q$_{0}$ = 0.5, respectively. These rates         overlap those for local spiral and H II galaxies today, although         they could be more than twice as high if dust extinction in the         UV is significant. If the objects at z = 3 were simply to fade         by 5 mag (assuming a {}10$^{7}$ yr burst and passive evolution)         without mergers in the 14 Gyr between then and now (for q$_{0}$         = 0.05, h$_{50}$ = 1.0), they would resemble average dwarf         elliptical/spheroidal galaxies in both luminosity and size.         However, the variety of morphologies and the high number density         of z = 3 galaxies in the HDF suggest that they represent a range         of physical processes and stages of galaxy formation and         evolution, rather than any one class of object, such as massive         ellipticals. A key issue remains the measurement of masses.         These high-redshift objects are likely to be the low-mass,         starbursting building blocks of more massive galaxies seen         today.

Using the common indices of         central concentration (C) and rotational asymmetry (A) to         quantify morphology, we consider independently two phenomena         that give rise to this k-correction. Bandshifting, the decrease         in the rest-frame wavelength of light observed through optical         filters, is explored by measuring these indices in several         passbands for each galaxy, and it is found to be the primary         driver of changes in C and A. In general, the optical trend         found for decreasing C and increasing A when going to shorter         wavelengths extends to the FUV. However, the patchy nature of         recent star formation in late-type galaxies, which is         accentuated in the FUV, results in poor quantitative         correspondence between morphologies determined in the optical         and FUV. We then artificially redshift our FUV images into the         Hubble Deep Field (HDF) filters to simulate various cosmological         distance effects, such as surface brightness dimming and loss of         spatial resolution. Hubble types of many galaxies in our sample         are not readily identifiable at redshifts beyond         z\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde1, and the galaxies themselves         are difficult to detect beyond         z\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde3. Because only features of the         highest surface brightness remain visible at cosmological         distances, the change in C and A between simulated high-z         galaxies and their unredshifted counterparts depends on whether         their irregular features are primarily bright or faint. Our         simulations suggest that k-corrections alone are indeed capable         of producing the peculiar morphologies observed at high         redshift; for example, several spiral galaxies have C and A         indices typical of irregular or peculiar HDF objects viewed at         z>=2. We briefly discuss some elements of a scheme to classify         rest-frame UV images, mergers, protogalaxies, and other objects         for which classical Hubble types do not adequately encompass the         existing morphology.},

Our sample consists of 19 photometrically         selected bright galaxies with m $_{F444W}$ {\ensuremath{\leq}}         27.8 at 7 < z < 9 and m $_{F444W}$ < 28.2 at z         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 9-15. We measure the size of         the galaxies in five bands, from rest-frame optical         (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde4800 {\r{A}}) to the UV         (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde1600 {\r{A}}) based on the         S{\'e}rsic model, and analyse the size-luminosity relation as a         function of wavelength. Remarkably, the data quality of the         NIRCam imaging is sufficient to probe the half-light radius r         $_{ e }$ down to \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde100 pc at z >         7. Given the limited sample size and magnitude range, we first         fix the slope to that observed for larger samples in rest-frame         UV using Hubble Space Telescope samples. The median size r         $_{0}$ at the reference luminosity M = -21 decreases slightly         from rest-frame optical (600 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 80 pc) to UV         (450 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 130 pc). We then refit the size-         luminosity relation allowing the slope to vary. The slope is         consistent with {\ensuremath{\beta}}         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 0.2 for all bands except F150W,         where we find a marginally steeper slope of {\ensuremath{\beta}}         = 0.53 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.15. The steep UV slope is mainly         driven by the smallest and faintest galaxies. If confirmed by         larger samples, it implies that the UV size-luminosity relation         breaks toward the faint end, as suggested by lensing studies.},

The         modelling includes a subgrid prescription for dusty star-forming         regions, with both the subgrid obscuration of these regions and         the fraction of metals in diffuse interstellar dust calibrated         against far-infrared fluxes of local galaxies. The predicted         optical colours as a function of stellar mass agree well with         observation, with the skirt model showing marked improvement         over a simple dust-screen model. The orientation dependence of         attenuation is weaker than observed because eagle galaxies are         generally puffier than real galaxies, due to the pressure floor         imposed on the interstellar medium (ISM). The mock H         {\ensuremath{\alpha}} luminosity function agrees reasonably well         with the data, and we quantify the extent to which dust         obscuration affects observed H {\ensuremath{\alpha}} fluxes. The         distribution of D4000 break values is bimodal, as observed. In         the simulation, 20 per cent of galaxies deemed 'passive' for the         skirt model, I.e. exhibiting D4000 >1.8, are classified 'active'         when ISM dust attenuation is not included. The fraction of         galaxies with stellar mass greater than {}10$^{10}$         M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ that are deemed passive is slightly         smaller than observed, which is due to low levels of residual         star formation in these simulated galaxies.

  abstract      = {We introduce the Virgo Consortium's Evolution and Assembly of GaLaxies         and their Environments (EAGLE) project, a suite of         hydrodynamical simulations that follow the formation of galaxies         and supermassive black holes in cosmologically representative         volumes of a standard {\ensuremath{\Lambda}} cold dark matter         universe. We discuss the limitations of such simulations in         light of their finite resolution and poorly constrained subgrid         physics, and how these affect their predictive power. One major         improvement is our treatment of feedback from massive stars and         active galactic nuclei (AGN) in which thermal energy is injected         into the gas without the need to turn off cooling or decouple         hydrodynamical forces, allowing winds to develop without         predetermined speed or mass loading factors. Because the         feedback efficiencies cannot be predicted from first principles,         we calibrate them to the present-day galaxy stellar mass         function and the amplitude of the galaxy-central black hole mass         relation, also taking galaxy sizes into account. The observed         galaxy stellar mass function is reproduced to         {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} 0.2 dex over the full resolved mass         range, {}10$^{8}$ < M$_{*}$/M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$         {\ensuremath{\lesssim}} {}10$^{11}$, a level of agreement close         to that attained by semi-analytic models, and unprecedented for         hydrodynamical simulations. We compare our results to a         representative set of low-redshift observables not considered in         the calibration, and find good agreement with the observed         galaxy specific star formation rates, passive fractions, Tully-         Fisher relation, total stellar luminosities of galaxy clusters,         and column density distributions of intergalactic C IV and O VI.         While the mass-metallicity relations for gas and stars are         consistent with observations for M$_{*}$ {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}}         {}10$^{9}$ M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ (M$_{*}$         {\ensuremath{\gtrsim}} {}10$^{10}$ M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ at         intermediate resolution), they are insufficiently steep at lower         masses. For the reference model, the gas fractions and         temperatures are too high for clusters of galaxies, but for         galaxy groups these discrepancies can be resolved by adopting a         higher heating temperature in the subgrid prescription for AGN         feedback. The EAGLE simulation suite, which also includes         physics variations and higher resolution zoomed-in volumes         described elsewhere, constitutes a valuable new resource for         studies of galaxy formation.},

It has an         essential role in research analysis pipelines in fields as         diverse as physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology,         psychology, materials science, engineering, finance and         economics.

Here we review how a few fundamental array concepts         lead to a simple and powerful programming paradigm for         organizing, exploring and analysing scientific data. NumPy is         the foundation upon which the scientific Python ecosystem is         constructed. It is so pervasive that several projects, targeting         audiences with specialized needs, have developed their own         NumPy-like interfaces and array objects. Owing to its central         position in the ecosystem, NumPy increasingly acts as an         interoperability layer between such array computation libraries         and, together with its application programming interface (API),         provides a flexible framework to support the next decade of         scientific and industrial analysis.},

  abstract      = {Quantitative morphologies, such as asymmetry and concentration, have         long been used as an effective way to assess the distribution of         galaxy starlight in large samples. Application of such         quantitative indicators to other data products could provide a         tool capable of capturing the two-dimensional distribution of a         range of galactic properties, such as stellar mass or star-         formation rate maps. In this work, we utilize galaxies from the         Illustris and IllustrisTNG simulations to assess the         applicability of concentration and asymmetry indicators to the         stellar mass distribution in galaxies. Specifically, we test         whether the intrinsic values of concentration and asymmetry         (measured directly from the simulation stellar mass particle         maps) are recovered after the application of measurement         uncertainty and a point spread function (PSF). We find that         random noise has a non-negligible systematic effect on asymmetry         that scales inversely with signal-to-noise ratio (S/N),         particularly at an S/N less than 100. We evaluate different         methods to correct for the noise contribution to asymmetry at         very low S/N, where previous studies have been unable to explore         due to systematics. We present algebraic corrections for noise         and resolution to recover the intrinsic morphology parameters.         Using Illustris as a comparison data set, we evaluate the         robustness of these fits in the presence of a different physics         model, and confirm these correction methods can be applied to         other data sets. Lastly, we provide estimations for the         uncertainty on different correction methods at varying S/N and         resolution regimes.},

To construct this system we         statistically analyse a sample of >22000 galaxies at v < 15000         km s$^{-1}$ (z < 0.05) with Spearman rank and principal-         component analyses (PCAs). Fourteen major galaxy properties are         considered, including: Hubble type, size, colour, surface         brightness, magnitude, stellar mass, internal velocities, HI gas         content and an index that measures dynamical disturbances. We         find, to a high degree, that most galaxy properties are         correlated, with in particular Hubble type, colour and stellar         mass all strongly related. We argue that this tight three-way         correlation is a result of evolutionary processes that depend on         galaxy mass, as we show that the relation between colour and         mass is independent of Hubble type. Various PCAs reveal that         most of the variation in nearby galaxy properties can be         accounted for by eigenvectors dominated by (i) the scale of a         galaxy, such as its stellar mass, (ii) the spectral type and         (iii) the degree of dynamical disturbances. We suggest that         these three properties: mass, star formation and         interactions/mergers are the major features that determine a         galaxy's physical state, and should be used to classify         galaxies. As shown by Conselice et al., these properties are         measurable within the CAS (concentration, asymmetry, clumpiness)         structural system, thus providing an efficient mechanism for         classifying galaxies in optical light within a physical         meaningful framework. We furthermore discuss the fraction and         number density of galaxies in the nearby universe as a function         of Hubble type, for comparison with higher redshift populations.},

We show that         low-redshift galaxies divide into two distinct families at a         stellar mass of 3 {\texttimes} {}10$^{10}$ M$_{solar}$. Lower-         mass galaxies have young stellar populations, low surface mass         densities and the low concentrations typical of discs. Their         star formation histories are more strongly correlated with         surface mass density than with stellar mass. A significant         fraction of the lowest-mass galaxies in our sample have         experienced recent starbursts. At given stellar mass, the sizes         of low-mass galaxies are lognormally distributed with dispersion         {\ensuremath{\sigma}}(lnR$_{50}$)         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde 0.5, in excellent agreement         with the idea that they form with little angular momentum loss         through cooling and condensation in a gravitationally dominant         dark matter halo. Their median stellar surface mass density         scales with stellar mass as {\ensuremath{\mu}}$_{*}$\raisebox{-0         .5ex}\textasciitildeM$^{0.54}$$_{*}$, suggesting that the         stellar mass of a disc galaxy is proportional to the three         halves power of its halo mass. All of this suggests that the         efficiency of the conversion of baryons into stars in low-mass         galaxies increases in proportion to halo mass, perhaps as a         result of supernova feedback processes. At stellar masses above         3 {\texttimes} {}10$^{10}$ M$_{solar}$, there is a rapidly         increasing fraction of galaxies with old stellar populations,         high surface mass densities and the high concentrations typical         of bulges. In this regime, the size distribution remains         lognormal, but its dispersion decreases rapidly with increasing         mass and the median stellar mass surface density is         approximately constant. This suggests that the star formation         efficiency decreases in the highest-mass haloes, and that little         star formation occurs in massive galaxies after they have         assembled.},

Using this sample we determine         how galaxy structure and morphology evolve with time, and         investigate the nature of galaxy structure at high redshift. We         visually classify our sample into discs, ellipticals and         peculiar systems and correct for redshift effects on these         classifications through simulations. We find significant         evolution in the fractions of galaxies at a given visual         classification as a function of redshift. The peculiar         population is dominant at z > 2 with a substantial spheroid         population, and a negligible disc population. We compute the         transition redshift, z$_{trans}$, where the combined fraction of         spheroidal and disc galaxies is equal to that of the peculiar         population, as z$_{trans}$ = 1.86 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.62 for         galaxies in our stellar mass range. We find that this transition         changes as a function of stellar mass, with Hubble-type galaxies         becoming dominant at higher redshifts for higher mass galaxies         (z$_{trans}$ = 2.22 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.82), than for the lower         mass galaxies (z$_{trans}$ = 1.73 {\ensuremath{\pm}} 0.57).         Higher mass galaxies become morphologically settled before their         lower mass counterparts, a form of morphological downsizing. We         furthermore compare our visual classifications with the         S{\'e}rsic index, the concentration, asymmetry and clumpiness         (CAS) parameters, star formation rate and rest-frame U - B         colour. We find links between the colour of a galaxy, its star         formation rate and how extended or peculiar it appears. Finally,         we discuss the negligible z > 2 disc fraction based on visual         morphologies and speculate that this is an effect of forming         disc appearing peculiar through processes such as violent disc         instabilities or mergers. We conclude that to properly define         and measure high-redshift morphology and structure a new and         more exact classification scheme is needed.},

We also find that the stellar         ages of our sample are younger (<1 Gyr) and the stellar         metallicities are also lower. Morphological parameters from the         Deep Learning catalog indicate that our galaxies are more likely         to be mergers. These results suggest that their low-metallicity         regions may be related to interaction; the inflow of metal-poor         gas may dilute the interstellar medium and form new metal-poor         stars in these galaxies during interactions.},

We trace the bimodality of         the distribution from luminous to faint galaxies by fitting         double Gaussians to the color functions separated in absolute         magnitude bins. Color-magnitude (CM) relations are obtained for         red and blue distributions (early- and late-type, predominantly         field, galaxies) without using any cut in morphology. Instead,         the analysis is based on the assumption of normal Gaussian         distributions in color. We find that the CM relations are well         fitted by a straight line plus a tanh function. Both relations         can be described by a shallow CM trend (slopes of about -0.04,         -0.05) plus a steeper transition in the average galaxy         properties over about 2 mag. The midpoints of the transitions         (M$_{r}$=-19.8 and -20.8 for the red and blue distributions,         respectively) occur around 2{\texttimes}{}10$^{10}$ M$_{solar}$         after converting luminosities to stellar mass. Separate         luminosity functions are obtained for the two distributions. The         red distribution has a more luminous characteristic magnitude         and a shallower faint-end slope (M$^{*}$=-21.5,         {\ensuremath{\alpha}}=-0.8) compared to the blue distribution         ({\ensuremath{\alpha}}\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde-1.3,         depending on the parameterization). These are approximately         converted to galaxy stellar mass functions. The red distribution         galaxies have a higher number density per magnitude for masses         greater than about 3{\texttimes}{}10$^{10}$ M$_{solar}$. Using a         simple merger model, we show that the differences between the         two functions are consistent with the red distribution being         formed from major galaxy mergers.},

  abstract      = {Testing theories of hierarchical structure formation requires estimating         the distribution of galaxy morphologies and its change with         redshift. One aspect of this investigation involves identifying         galaxies with disturbed morphologies (e.g. merging galaxies).         This is often done by summarizing galaxy images using, e.g. the         concentration, asymmetry and clumpiness and Gini-M$_{20}$         statistics of Conselice and Lotz et al., respectively, and         associating particular statistic values with disturbance. We         introduce three statistics that enhance detection of disturbed         morphologies at high redshift (z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 2): the         multimode (M), intensity (I) and deviation (D) statistics. We         show their effectiveness by training a machine-learning         classifier, random forest, using 1639 galaxies observed in the H         band by the Hubble Space Telescope WFC3, galaxies that had been         previously classified by eye by the Cosmic Assembly Near-IR Deep         Extragalactic Legacy Survey collaboration. We find that the MID         statistics (and the A statistic of Conselice) are the most         useful for identifying disturbed morphologies.         We also explore whether human         annotators are useful for identifying disturbed morphologies. We         demonstrate that they show limited ability to detect disturbance         at high redshift, and that increasing their number beyond         {\ensuremath{\approx}}10 does not provably yield better         classification performance. We propose a simulation-based model-         fitting algorithm that mitigates these issues by bypassing         annotation.},

We classify our galaxies         into single exponential (T I), down-bending (T II), and up-         bending (T III) SBP types and derive their spin parameters and         radial profiles of age/metallicity-sensitive spectral features.         Most T II (T III) galaxies have down-bending (up-bending) star         formation rate (SFR) radial profiles, implying that abrupt         radial changes of SFR intensities contribute to the formation of         both T II and T III breaks. Nevertheless, a comparison between         our galaxies and simulations suggests that stellar migration         plays a significant role in weakening down-bending         {\ensuremath{\Sigma}}$_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ profile breaks.         While there is a correlation between the break strengths of SBPs         and age/metallicity-sensitive spectral features for T II         galaxies, no such correlation is found for T III galaxies,         indicating that stellar migration may not play a major role in         shaping T III breaks, as is also evidenced by a good         correspondence between the break strengths of         {\ensuremath{\Sigma}}$_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$ and SBPs of T III         galaxies. We do not find evidence for galaxy spin being a         relevant parameter for forming different SBP types, nor do we         find significant differences between the asymmetries of galaxies         with different SBP types, suggesting that environmental         disturbances or satellite accretion in the recent past do not         significantly influence the break formation. By dividing our         sample into early and late morphological types, we find that         galaxies with different SBP types follow nearly the same tight         stellar mass- ${R}_{25}$ relation, which makes the hypothesis         that stellar migration alone can transform SBP types from T II         to T I and then to T III highly unlikely.},

By combining accurate existing         visual classification catalogues with machine learning, we         provide the largest and most accurate morphological catalogue up         to date. The classifications are obtained with Deep Learning         algorithms using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). We use         two visual classification catalogues, GZ2 and Nair \& Abraham         (2010), for training CNNs with colour images in order to obtain         T-types and a series of GZ2 type questions (disc/features, edge-         on galaxies, bar signature, bulge prominence, roundness, and         mergers). We also provide an additional probability enabling a         separation between pure elliptical (E) from S0, where the T-type         model is not so efficient. For the T-type, our results show         smaller offset and scatter than previous models trained with         support vector machines.

  abstract      = {Classification of galaxy morphology is a challenging but meaningful task         for the enormous amount of data produced by the next-generation         telescope. By introducing the adaptive polar-coordinate         transformation, we develop a rotationally-invariant supervised         machine-learning (SML) method that ensures consistent         classifications when rotating galaxy images, which is always         required to be satisfied physically, but difficult to achieve         algorithmically. The adaptive polar-coordinate transformation,         compared with the conventional method of data augmentation by         including additional rotated images in the training set, is         proved to be an effective and efficient method in improving the         robustness of the SML methods. In the previous work, we         generated a catalog of galaxies with well-classified         morphologies via our developed unsupervised machine-learning         (UML) method. By using this UML data set as the training set, we         apply the new method to classify galaxies into five categories         (unclassifiable, irregulars, late-type disks, early-type disks,         and spheroids). In general, the result of our morphological         classifications following the sequence from irregulars to         spheroids agrees well with the expected trends of other galaxy         properties, including S{\'e}rsic indices, effective radii,         nonparametric statistics, and colors. Thus, we demonstrate that         the rotationally-invariant SML method, together with the         previously developed UML method, completes the entire task of         automatic classification of galaxy morphology.},

  abstract = {Surface photometry shows that most spiral and S0 galaxies have two main         components: a spheroidal component, and an exponential disk         component with radial surface-brightness distribution 1(R) = Ioe         5. The exponential disk is the subject of this paper. First, for         the exponential disk in centrifugal equilibrium with surface         density (R) = , we derive the circular-velocity field and the         mass- angular momentum distribution (h); (h) is the total mass         with angular momentum per unit mass less than h. (h) for the         exponential disk is almost identical with (k) for a family of         rigidly rotating spheres of uniform density. We then collect         photometric data for the disks of thirty-six spiral and S0         galaxies, and find the following: (i) Twenty-eight of the         thirty-six galaxies have approximately the same intensity scale         1o (21.65 B-mag per square second of arc), with a standard         deviation of only 0.30 mag per square second of arc, despite a         range of nearly 5 mag in absolute magnitude. This constancy of         1o produces the correlation between apparent magnitude and         angular diameter found by Hubble. (ii) S0-Sbc systems have any         value of the disk length scale between 1 and 5 kpc, while later-         type systems have predominantly low values of a (<2 kpc). (iii)         The relative brightness and size of the spheroidal and disk         components are only weakly with morphological type. If         conclusion (i) implies that s is approximately constant, then         the disk's total mass and angular momentum satisfy 7/4 If (h) is         invariant as a protogalaxy collapses to form a galaxy, then all         protogalaxies destined to be S0 or spiral galaxies have a         similar (h) (in dimensionless variables), at least for the range         of h corresponding to the disk. If (k) is not invariant, then         there exists a very efficient mechanism which establishes the         characteristic ) (h) for these systems as they form. The         exponential nature of the disk is not defined by i) alone; its         cause remains uncertain.},

We produce mock g-band         images comparable to observational surveys from the publicly         available Illustris simulation idealized mock images at z = 0.         We then measure non-parametric indicators: asymmetry, Gini,         M$_{20}$, clumpiness, and concentration for a set of galaxies         with M$_{*}$ > {}10$^{10}$ M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. We         correlate these automatic statistics with the recent merger         history of galaxies and with the presence of close companions.         Our main contribution is to assess in a cosmological framework,         the empirically derived non-parametric demarcation line and         average time-scales used to determine the merger rate         observationally. We found that 98 per cent of galaxies above the         demarcation line have a close companion or have experienced a         recent merger event. On average, merger signatures obtained from         the G-M$_{20}$ criterion anti-correlate clearly with the         elapsing time to the last merger event. We also find that the         asymmetry correlates with galaxy pair separation and relative         velocity, exhibiting the larger enhancements for those systems         with pair separations d < 50 h$^{-1}$ kpc and relative         velocities V < 350 km s$^{-1}$. We find that the G-M$_{20}$ is         most sensitive to recent mergers ({\ensuremath{\sim}}0.14 Gyr)         and to ongoing mergers with stellar mass ratios greater than         0.1. For this indicator, we compute a merger average         observability time-scale of {\ensuremath{\sim}}0.2 Gyr, in         agreement with previous results and demonstrate that the         morphologically derived merger rate recovers the intrinsic total         merger rate of the simulation and the merger rate as a function         of stellar mass.},

We         measure automated diagnostics of galaxy morphology in         cosmological simulations of the formation of 22 central galaxies         with 9.3 < log$_{10}$M$_{*}$/M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ < 10.7.         These high-spatial-resolution zoom-in calculations enable         accurate modelling of the rest-frame UV and optical morphology.         Even with small numbers of galaxies, we find that structural         evolution is neither universal nor monotonic: galaxy         interactions can trigger either bulge or disc formation, and         optically bulge-dominated galaxies at this mass may not remain         so forever. Simulated galaxies with M$_{*}$ >         {}10$^{10}$M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$ contain relatively more         disc-dominated light profiles than those with lower mass,         reflecting significant disc brightening in some haloes at 1 < z         < 2. By this epoch, simulated galaxies with specific star         formation rates below 10$^{- 9.7}$ yr$^{- 1}$ are more likely         than normal star-formers to have a broader mix of structural         types, especially at M$_{*}$ > {}10$^{10}$         M$_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$. We analyse a cosmological major         merger at z {\ensuremath{\sim}} 1.5 and find that the newly         proposed Multimode-Intensity-Deviation (MID) morphology         diagnostics trace later merger stages while Gini-M$_{20}$ trace         earlier ones. MID is sensitive also to clumpy star-forming         discs. The observability time of typical MID-enhanced events in         our simulation sample is <100 Myr. A larger sample of         cosmological assembly histories may be required to calibrate         such diagnostics in the face of their sensitivity to viewing         angle, segmentation algorithm, and various phenomena such as         clumpy star formation and minor mergers.},

The new system includes the         original and modified versions of the CASGM coefficients         (Concentration C$_{1}$, Asymmetry A$_{3}$, and Smoothness         S$_{3}$), and the new parameters entropy, H, and spirality         {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{{\ensuremath{\psi}}}$. The new         parameters A$_{3}$, S$_{3}$, and H are better to discriminate         galaxy classes than A$_{1}$, S$_{1}$, and G, respectively. The         new parameter {\ensuremath{\sigma}}$_{{\ensuremath{\psi}}}$         captures the amount of non-radial pattern on the image and is         almost linearly dependent on T-type. Using a sample of spiral         and elliptical galaxies from the Galaxy Zoo project as a         training set, we employed the Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)         technique to classify EFIGI (Baillard et al. 4458 galaxies),         Nair \& Abraham (14,123 galaxies), and SDSS Legacy (779,235         galaxies) samples. The cross-validation test shows that we can         achieve an accuracy of more than 90\% with our classification         scheme. Therefore, we are able to define a plane in the         morphometric parameter space that separates the elliptical and         spiral classes with a mismatch between classes smaller than         10\%. We use the distance to this plane as a morphometric index         (M$_{i}$) and we show that it follows the human based T-type         index very closely. We calculate morphometric index M$_{i}$ for         {\ensuremath{\sim}}780k galaxies from SDSS Legacy Survey-DR7. We         discuss how M$_{i}$ correlates with stellar population         parameters obtained using the spectra available from SDSS-DR7.},

We use the new         indicator, together with pre-existing diagnostics of galaxy         structure to study the role of galaxy mergers in inducing         (post-) starburst spectral signatures in local galaxies, and         investigate whether (post-) starburst galaxies play a role in         the build-up of the `red sequence'. Our morphological and         structural analysis of an evolutionary sample of 335 (post-)         starburst galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7 with         starburst ages 0 < t$_{SB}$ < 0.6 Gyr, shows that 45 per cent of         galaxies with young starbursts (t$_{SB}$ < 0.1 Gyr) show         signatures of an ongoing or past merger. This fraction declines         with starburst age, and we find a good agreement between         automated and visual classifications. The majority of the oldest         (post-) starburst galaxies in our sample (t$_{SB}$         {\ensuremath{\sim}} 0.6 Gyr) have structural properties         characteristic of early-type discs and are not as highly         concentrated as the fully quenched galaxies commonly found on         the `red sequence' in the present day Universe. This suggests         that, if (post-) starburst galaxies are a transition phase         between active star-formation and quiescence, they do not attain         the structure of presently quenched galaxies within the first         0.6 Gyr after the starburst.},

This is the biggest visually classified sample observed         with JWST yet, $\sim20$ times larger than previous studies, and         allows us to examine in detail how galaxy structure has changed         over this critical epoch. All sources were classified by six         individual classifiers using a simple classification scheme         aimed to produce disk/spheroid/peculiar classifications, whereby         we determine how the relative number of these morphologies         evolves since the Universe's first billion years. Additionally,         we explore structural and quantitative morphology measurements         using textsc\{Morfometryka\}, and show that         galaxies at $z > 3$ are not dominated by irregular and peculiar         structures, either visually or quantitatively, as previously         thought. We find a strong dominance of morphologically selected         disk galaxies up to $z = 8$, a far higher redshift than         previously thought possible. We also find that the stellar mass         and star formation rate densities are dominated by disk galaxies         up to $z \sim 6$, demonstrating that most stars in the universe         were likely formed in a disk galaxy. We compare our results to         theory to show that the fraction of types we find is predicted         by cosmological simulations, and that the Hubble Sequence was         already in place as early as one billion years after the Big         Bang.

We measure the         half-light radius, the concentration index, the asymmetry index,         the smoothness index, the Gini coefficient, and the M$_{20}$         indicator in various wavebands from UV to submm wavelengths, and         in stellar mass, dust mass, and star formation rate maps. We         find that the interstellar dust in galaxies is distributed in a         more extended, less centrally concentrated, more asymmetric, and         more clumpy way than the stars are. This is particularly evident         when comparing morphological indicators based on the stellar         mass and dust mass maps. This should serve as a warning sign         against treating the dust in galaxies as a simple smooth         component. We argue that the nonparametric galaxy morphology of         galaxies from UV to submm wavelengths is an interesting test for         cosmological hydrodynamics simulations.},

To         interpret our galaxy structure measurements, we also run and         analyze 250 simulation realizations from IllustrisTNG to         determine the timescale of mergers for the CAS system. We         measure that from z = 0-3, the median asymmetry merger timescale         is ${0.50}_{-0.18}^{+0.33}$ Gyr, and find that it does not vary         with redshift. Using these data, we find that galaxies become         progressively asymmetric at a given mass at higher redshifts,         and we derive merger rates that scale as $\sim         {\left(1+z\right)}^{1.87\pm 0.04}$ Gyr$^{-1}$, which agrees well         with recent machine-learning and galaxy-pair approaches,         removing previous inconsistencies. We also show that far-         infrared selected galaxies that are invisible to the Hubble         Space Telescope have a negligible effect on our measurements. We         also find that galaxies are more concentrated at higher         redshifts. We interpret this as a sign that their formation         occurs from a smaller initial galaxy that later grows into a         larger one through mergers, consistent with the size growth of         galaxies from the inside out, suggesting that the centers are         the oldest parts of most galaxies.},

  abstract      = {Over the past two decades, an avalanche of new data from multiwavelength         imaging and spectroscopic surveys has revolutionized our view of         galaxy formation and evolution. Here we review the range of         complementary techniques and theoretical tools that allow         astronomers to map the cosmic history of star formation, heavy         element production, and reionization of the Universe from the         cosmic {\textquotedblleft}dark ages{\textquotedblright} to the         present epoch. A consistent picture is emerging, whereby the         star-formation rate density peaked approximately 3.5 Gyr after         the Big Bang, at z{\ensuremath{\approx}}1.9, and declined         exponentially at later times, with an e-folding timescale of 3.9         Gyr. Half of the stellar mass observed today was formed before a         redshift z = 1.3. About 25\% formed before the peak of the         cosmic star-formation rate density, and another 25\% formed         after z = 0.7. Less than {\ensuremath{\sim}}1\% of today's stars         formed during the epoch of reionization. Under the assumption of         a universal initial mass function, the global stellar mass         density inferred at any epoch matches reasonably well the time         integral of all the preceding star-formation activity. The         comoving rates of star formation and central black hole         accretion follow a similar rise and fall, offering evidence for         coevolution of black holes and their host galaxies. The rise of         the mean metallicity of the Universe to about 0.001 solar by z =         6, one Gyr after the Big Bang, appears to have been accompanied         by the production of fewer than ten hydrogen Lyman-continuum         photons per baryon, a rather tight budget for cosmological         reionization.},

We apply this         statistic to a sample of local galaxies with archival images at         1500 and 2500 {\r{A}} from the Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope and         ground-based B-band observations in order to investigate how the         internal dispersion between these colors relates to global         galaxy properties (e.g., luminosity, color, and morphological         type). In general, the dispersion in the internal galaxy colors         correlates with transformations in the galaxy morphology as a         function of wavelength; i.e., our internal color dispersion         statistic quantifies the morphological K-correction. Mid-type         spiral galaxies exhibit the highest dispersion in their         ultraviolet-optical internal colors, which stems from         differences in the stellar content that constitute the bulge,         disk, and spiral-arm components. Irregular and late-type spiral         galaxies show moderate internal color dispersion, although with         lower values relative to the mid-type spirals. This implies that         young stars generally dominate the ultraviolet-optical galaxy         colors, modulo variations in the dust, gas, and stellar         distributions. Elliptical, lenticular, and early-type spiral         galaxies generally have low or negligible internal color         dispersion, which indicates that the stars contributing to the         ultraviolet-optical emission have a very homogeneous         distribution. We discuss the application of the internal color         dispersion to high-redshift galaxies in deep Hubble Space         Telescope images. By simulating the appearance of the local         galaxy sample at cosmological distances, many of the galaxies         have luminosities that are sufficiently bright at rest-frame         optical wavelengths to be detected within the limits of the         currently deepest near-infrared surveys, even with no evolution.         Under the assumption that the luminosity and color evolution of         the local galaxies conform with the measured values of high-         redshift objects, we show that galaxies' intrinsic internal         color dispersion remains measurable out to         z\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde3.},

We find evidence that dustier galaxies         have more nebulous UV morphologies and that larger, more         luminous galaxies may drive stronger outflows, but we otherwise         conclude that UV morphology is either statistically decoupled         from the majority of physical observables or determined by too         complex a combination of physical processes to provide         characterizations with predictive power. Given the absence of         strong correlations between UV morphology and physical         parameters such as star formation rates, we are therefore unable         to support the hypothesis that morphologically irregular         galaxies predominantly represent major galaxy mergers. Comparing         galaxy samples, we find that IR-selected BzK galaxies and radio-         selected submillimeter galaxies have UV morphologies similar to         the optically selected sample, while distant red galaxies are         more nebulous.},

We         explore the dependence of the various morphological parameters         on wavelength and morphological type. Our goal is to quantify         the difference in morphology between the stellar and nebular         components. We derive the nonparametric morphological indicators         of 364 galaxies from the CALIFA Survey. To calculate those         indicators, we apply the StatMorph package on the high-quality         integral field spectroscopic data cubes, as well as to the most         prominent nebular emission-line maps, namely         [OIII]$\lambda$5007, H$\alpha$, and [NII]$\lambda$6583. We show         that the physical size of galaxies, M$_{20}$ index, and         concentration have a strong gradient from blue to red optical         wavelengths. We find that the light distribution of the nebular         emission is less concentrated than the stellar continuum. A         comparison between the nonparametric indicators and the galaxy         physical properties revealed a very strong correlation of the         concentration with the specific star-formation rate and         morphological type. Furthermore, we explore how the galaxy         inclination affects our results. We find that edge-on galaxies         show a more rapid change in physical size and concentration with         increasing wavelength due to the increase in optical free path.         We conclude that the apparent morphology of galaxies originates         from the pure stellar distribution, but the morphology of the         ISM presents differences with respect to the morphology of the         stellar component. Our analysis also highlights the importance         of dust attenuation and galaxy inclination in the measurement of         nonparametric morphological indicators, especially in the the         wavelength range 4000-5000 {\r{A}}.},

  abstract      = {The Chinese Space Station Optical Survey (CSS-OS) is a planned full sky         survey operated by the Chinese Space Station Telescope (CSST).         It can simultaneously perform the photometric imaging and         spectroscopic slitless surveys, and will probe weak and strong         gravitational lensing, galaxy clustering, individual galaxies         and galaxy clusters, active galactic nucleus, and so on. It aims         to explore the properties of dark matter and dark energy and         other important cosmological problems. In this work, we focus on         two main CSS-OS scientific goals, i.e., the weak gravitational         lensing (WL) and galaxy clustering surveys. We generate the mock         CSS-OS data based on the observational COSMOS and zCOSMOS         catalogs. We investigate the constraints on the cosmological         parameters from the CSS-OS using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo         method. The intrinsic alignments, galaxy bias, velocity         dispersion, and systematics from instrumental effects in the         CSST WL and galaxy clustering surveys are also included, and         their impacts on the constraint results are discussed. We find         that the CSS-OS can improve the constraints on the cosmological         parameters by a factor of a few (even one order of magnitude in         the optimistic case), compared to the current WL and galaxy         clustering surveys. The constraints can be further enhanced when         performing joint analysis with the WL, galaxy clustering, and         galaxy-galaxy lensing data. Therefore, the CSS-OS is expected to         be a powerful survey for exploring the universe. Since some         assumptions may be still optimistic and simple, it is possible         that the results from the real survey could be worse. We will         study these issues in detail with the help of simulations in the         future.},

  abstract      = {We present a comprehensive analysis of the evolution of the         morphological and structural properties of a large sample of         galaxies at z = 3-9 using early James Webb Space Telescope         (JWST) CEERS NIRCam observations. Our sample consists of 850         galaxies at z > 3 detected in both Hubble Space Telescope         (HST)/WFC3 and CEERS JWST/NIRCam images, enabling a comparison         of HST and JWST morphologies. We conduct a set of visual         classifications, with each galaxy in the sample classified three         times. We also measure quantitative morphologies across all         NIRCam filters. We find that galaxies at z > 3 have a wide         diversity of morphologies. Galaxies with disks make up 60\% of         galaxies at z = 3, and this fraction drops to         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde30\% at z = 6-9, while galaxies         with spheroids make up \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde30\%-40\%         across the redshift range, and pure spheroids with no evidence         for disks or irregular features make up         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde20\%. The fraction of galaxies         with irregular features is roughly constant at all redshifts         (\raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde40\%-50\%), while those that         are purely irregular increases from         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde12\% to         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde20\% at z > 4.5. We note that         these are apparent fractions, as many observational effects         impact the visibility of morphological features at high         redshift. On average, Spheroid-only galaxies have a higher         S{\'e}rsic index, smaller size, and higher axis ratio than disk         or irregular galaxies. Across all redshifts, smaller spheroid         and disk galaxies tend to be rounder. Overall, these trends         suggest that galaxies with established disks and spheroids exist         across the full redshift range of this study, and further work         with large samples at higher redshift is needed to quantify when         these features first formed.},

  abstract      = {A key obstacle to understanding the galaxy merger rate and its role in         galaxy evolution is the difficulty in constraining the merger         properties and time-scales from instantaneous snapshots of the         real Universe. The most common way to identify galaxy mergers is         by morphology, yet current theoretical calculations of the time-         scales for galaxy disturbances are quite crude. We present a         morphological analysis of a large suite of GADGET         N-body/hydrodynamical equal-mass gas-rich disc galaxy mergers         which have been processed through the Monte Carlo radiative         transfer code SUNRISE. With the resulting images, we examine the         dependence of quantitative morphology (G, M$_{20}$, C, A) in the         SDSS g band on merger stage, dust, viewing angle, orbital         parameters, gas properties, supernova feedback and total mass.         We find that mergers appear most disturbed in G - M$_{20}$ and         asymmetry at the first pass and at the final coalescence of         their nuclei, but can have normal quantitative morphologies at         other merger stages. The merger observability time-scales depend         on the method used to identify the merger as well as the gas         fraction, pericentric distance and relative orientation of the         merging galaxies. Enhanced star formation peaks after and lasts         significantly longer than strong morphological disturbances.         Despite their massive bulges, the majority of merger remnants         appear disc-like and dusty in g-band light because of the         presence of a low-mass star-forming disc.},

  abstract      = {We present the results of a systematic search for candidate quiescent         galaxies in the distant universe in 11 JWST fields with publicly         available observations collected during the first 3 months of         operations and covering an effective sky area of         \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde145 arcmin$^{2}$. We         homogeneously reduce the new JWST data and combine them with         existing observations from the Hubble Space Telescope. We select         a robust sample of \raisebox{-0.5ex}\textasciitilde80 candidate         quiescent and quenching galaxies at 3 < z < 5 using two methods:         (1) based on their rest-frame UVJ colors, and (2) a novel         quantitative approach based on Gaussian mixture modeling of the         near-UV - U, U - V, and V - J rest-frame color space, which is         more sensitive to recently quenched objects. We measure comoving         number densities of massive (M $_{{\ensuremath{\star}}}$         {\ensuremath{\geq}} 10$^{10.6}$ M $_{{\ensuremath{\odot}}}$)         quiescent galaxies consistent with previous estimates relying on         ground-based observations, after homogenizing the results in the         literature with our mass and redshift intervals. However, we         find significant field-to-field variations of the number         densities up to a factor of 2-3, highlighting the effect of         cosmic variance and suggesting the presence of overdensities of         red quiescent galaxies at z > 3, as could be expected for highly         clustered massive systems. Importantly, JWST enables the robust         identification of quenching/quiescent galaxy candidates at lower         masses and higher redshifts than before, challenging standard         formation scenarios. All data products, including the literature         compilation, are made publicly available.},
