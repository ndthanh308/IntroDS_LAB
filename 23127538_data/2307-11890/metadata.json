  "abstract": "Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) have attracted increasing interest as a unique class of topological quantum materials. One distinct property of HOTIs is the crystalline symmetry-imposed topological state at the lower-dimensional outer boundary, e.g. the zero-dimensional (0D) corner state of a 2D HOTI, used exclusively as a universal signature to identify higher-order topology but yet with uncertainty. Strikingly, we discover the existence of inner topological point states (TPS) in a 2D HOTI, as the embedded \"end\" states of 1D first-order TI, as exemplified by those located at the vacancies in a Kekule lattice. Significantly, we demonstrate that such inner TPS can be unambiguously distinguished from the trivial point-defect states, by their unique topology-endowed inter-TPS interaction and correlated magnetic response in spectroscopy measurements, overcoming an outstanding experimental challenge. Furthermore, based on first-principles calculations, we propose γ-graphyne as a promising material to observe the higher-order TPS. Our findings shed new light on our fundamental understanding of HOTIs, and also open an avenue to experimentally distinguishing and tuning TPS in the interior of a 2D sample for potential applications.",
