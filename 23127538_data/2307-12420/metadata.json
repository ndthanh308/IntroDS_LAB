  "abstract": "We consider the torus reduction of heterotic supergravity in the presence of four-derivative corrections. In particular, the reduction on $T^n$ generically leads to a half-maximal supergravity coupled to $n$ vector multiplets, and we show that it is consistent to truncate out said vector multiplets. This is done by the analysis of both the bosonic equations of motion and the Killing spinor equations. As an application of the consistent truncation, we examine the four-derivative corrected BPS black string that reduces to a black hole in minimal nine-dimensional supergravity.",
