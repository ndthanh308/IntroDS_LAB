\section{Introduction}

This paper is about using low precision arithmetic in the computation of
a Newton step. In many cases the cost of the factorization of the Jacobian is
$O(N^3)$, where $N$ is the number of unknowns, and this dominates the cost of
the computation. Therefore, computation of the factorization in lower precision
offers significant savings in cost.

The new algorithms in this paper
are based on prior results from \cite{ctk:fajulia, ctk:sirev20}.
In that older work we implemented Newton's method for the nonlinear equation
in two precisions. We evaluated the nonlinear residual in double precision 
and stored and factored the Jacobian in a lower precision 
(either single or half). 
The resulting algorithm is
a nonlinear version of the
classic iterative refinement method from linear algebra
\cite{higham,wilkinson63}.

In \cite{ctk:sirev20} we observed that using
half precision, while offering the potential of faster computation, 
degraded
the performance of the nonlinear iteration for ill-conditioned problems.
In this paper we suggest a way to address that issue by storing copies
of the Jacobian in both single and half precision, factoring the Jacobian
in half precision, and solving the equation for the Newton step
in single precision using the half precision factorization within 
iterative refinement (IR). We can make this process more robust by using the
GMRES-IR method of \cite{CarsonHigham1,CarsonHigham}, where the low
precision factorization is used as a preconditioner for a GMRES 
iteration for the high precision problem. 

We view this as an inexact Newton method \cite{demboes,ctk:roots} 
and the nonlinear convergence analysis will depend on the performance
of the underlying linear iterative method, which will be IR or GMRES-IR.
