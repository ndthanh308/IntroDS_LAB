We presented a Dijkstra-inspired calculational proof format with an
associated proof checker in ACL2s that has been used at Northeastern
University to teach over a thousand freshman-level undergraduate
students how to reason about computation.  For future work, we plan to
develop a ``professional'' version of the proof checker that is
interactive, automatically generates proof obligations (\eg, for
inductive proofs), proves easy cases automatically, and intelligently
generates aspects of proofs and hints.  We believe that such
functionality can be of immense use for proof engineers writing ACL2s
proofs.
