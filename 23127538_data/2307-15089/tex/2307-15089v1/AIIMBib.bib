	abstract = {We introduce the problem of robust subgroup discovery, i.e., finding a set of interpretable descriptions of subsets that 1) stand out with respect to one or more target attributes, 2) are statistically robust, and 3) non-redundant. Many attempts have been made to mine either locally robust subgroups or to tackle the pattern explosion, but we are the first to address both challenges at the same time from a global modelling perspective. First, we formulate the broad model class of subgroup lists, i.e., ordered sets of subgroups, for univariate and multivariate targets that can consist of nominal or numeric variables, including traditional top-1 subgroup discovery in its definition. This novel model class allows us to formalise the problem of optimal robust subgroup discovery using the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, where we resort to optimal Normalised Maximum Likelihood and Bayesian encodings for nominal and numeric targets, respectively. Second, finding optimal subgroup lists is NP-hard. Therefore, we propose SSD++, a greedy heuristic that finds good subgroup lists and guarantees that the most significant subgroup found according to the MDL criterion is added in each iteration. In fact, the greedy gain is shown to be equivalent to a Bayesian one-sample proportion, multinomial, or t-test between the subgroup and dataset marginal target distributions plus a multiple hypothesis testing penalty. Furthermore, we empirically show on 54 datasets that SSD++ outperforms previous subgroup discovery methods in terms of quality, generalisation on unseen data, and subgroup list size.},

	abstract = {Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) usually enroll heterogeneous study population, and thus it is interesting to identify subgroups of patients for whom the treatment may be beneficial or harmful. A variety of methods have been developed to do such kind of post hoc analyses. Conventional generalized linear model is able to include prognostic variables as a main effect and predictive variables in an interaction with treatment variable. A statistically significant and large interaction effect usually indicates potential subgroups that may have different responses to the treatment. However, the conventional regression method requires to specify the interaction term, which requires knowledge of predictive variables or becomes infeasible when there is a large number of feature variables. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) method does variable selection by shrinking less clear effects (including interaction effects) to zero and in this way selects only certain variables and interactions for the model. There are many tree-based methods for subgroup identification. For example, model-based recursive partitioning incorporates parametric models such as generalized linear models into trees. The model incorporated is usually a simple model with only the treatment as covariate. Predictive and prognostic variables are found and incorporated automatically via the tree. The present article gives an overview of these methods and explains how to perform them using the free software environment for statistical computing R (version 3.3.2). A simulated dataset is employed for illustrating the performance of these methods.},

	abstract = {Interpretable classifiers have recently witnessed an increase in attention from the data mining community because they are inherently easier to understand and explain than their more complex counterparts. Examples of interpretable classification models include decision trees, rule sets, and rule lists. Learning such models often involves optimizing hyperparameters, which typically requires substantial amounts of data and may result in relatively large models. In this paper, we consider the problem of learning compact yet accurate probabilistic rule lists for multiclass classification. Specifically, we propose a novel formalization based on probabilistic rule lists and the minimum description length ({MDL}) principle. This results in virtually parameter-free model selection that naturally allows to trade-off model complexity with goodness of fit, by which overfitting and the need for hyperparameter tuning are effectively avoided. Finally, we introduce the Classy algorithm, which greedily finds rule lists according to the proposed criterion. We empirically demonstrate that Classy selects small probabilistic rule lists that outperform state-of-the-art classifiers when it comes to the combination of predictive performance and interpretability. We show that Classy is insensitive to its only parameter, i.e., the candidate set, and that compression on the training set correlates with classification performance, validating our {MDL}-based selection criterion.},

	abstract = {Rater agreement is important in clinical research, and Cohen’s Kappa is a widely used method for assessing inter-rater reliability; however, there are well documented statistical problems associated with the measure. In order to assess its utility, we evaluated it against Gwet’s AC1 and compared the results. This study was carried out across 67 patients (56\% males) aged 18 to 67, with a mean SD of 44.13 ± 12.68 years. Nine raters (7 psychiatrists, a psychiatry resident and a social worker) participated as interviewers, either for the first or the second interviews, which were held 4 to 6 weeks apart. The interviews were held in order to establish a personality disorder (PD) diagnosis using DSM-IV criteria. Cohen’s Kappa and Gwet’s AC1 were used and the level of agreement between raters was assessed in terms of a simple categorical diagnosis (i.e., the presence or absence of a disorder). Data were also compared with a previous analysis in order to evaluate the effects of trait prevalence. Gwet’s AC1 was shown to have higher inter-rater reliability coefficients for all the PD criteria, ranging from .752 to 1.000, whereas Cohen’s Kappa ranged from 0 to 1.00. Cohen’s Kappa values were high and close to the percentage of agreement when the prevalence was high, whereas Gwet’s AC1 values appeared not to change much with a change in prevalence, but remained close to the percentage of agreement. For example a Schizoid sample revealed a mean Cohen’s Kappa of .726 and a Gwet’s AC1of .853 , which fell within the different level of agreement according to criteria developed by Landis and Koch, and Altman and Fleiss. Based on the different formulae used to calculate the level of chance-corrected agreement, Gwet’s AC1 was shown to provide a more stable inter-rater reliability coefficient than Cohen’s Kappa. It was also found to be less affected by prevalence and marginal probability than that of Cohen’s Kappa, and therefore should be considered for use with inter-rater reliability analysis.},

    abstract = { Lung cancer remains the most common cause of cancer death worldwide. Recent advances in lung cancer screening, radiotherapy, surgical techniques, and systemic therapy have led to increasing complexity in diagnosis, treatment decision-making, and assessment of recurrence. Artificial intelligence (AI)–based prediction models are being developed to address these issues and may have a future role in screening, diagnosis, treatment selection, and decision-making around salvage therapy. Imaging plays an essential role in all components of lung cancer management and has the potential to play a key role in AI applications. Artificial intelligence has demonstrated value in prognostic biomarker discovery in lung cancer diagnosis, treatment, and response assessment, putting it at the forefront of the next phase of personalized medicine. However, although exploratory studies demonstrate potential utility, there is a need for rigorous validation and standardization before AI can be utilized in clinical decision-making. In this review, we will provide a summary of the current literature implementing AI for outcome prediction in lung cancer. We will describe the anticipated impact of AI on the management of patients with lung cancer and discuss the challenges of clinical implementation of these techniques. }

Worldwide, an estimated 19.3 million new cancer cases (18.1 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths (9.9 million excluding nonmelanoma skin cancer) occurred in 2020. Female breast cancer has surpassed lung cancer as the most commonly diagnosed cancer, with an estimated 2.3 million new cases (11.7\%), followed by lung (11.4\%), colorectal (10.0 \%), prostate (7.3\%), and stomach (5.6\%) cancers. Lung cancer remained the leading cause of cancer death, with an estimated 1.8 million deaths (18\%), followed by colorectal (9.4\%), liver (8.3\%), stomach (7.7\%), and female breast (6.9\%) cancers. Overall incidence was from 2-fold to 3-fold higher in transitioned versus transitioning countries for both sexes, whereas mortality varied {\textless}2-fold for men and little for women. Death rates for female breast and cervical cancers, however, were considerably higher in transitioning versus transitioned countries (15.0 vs 12.8 per 100,000 and 12.4 vs 5.2 per 100,000, respectively). The global cancer burden is expected to be 28.4 million cases in 2040, a 47\% rise from 2020, with a larger increase in transitioning (64\% to 95\%) versus transitioned (32\% to 56\%) countries due to demographic changes, although this may be further exacerbated by increasing risk factors associated with globalization and a growing economy. Efforts to build a sustainable infrastructure for the dissemination of cancer prevention measures and provision of cancer care in transitioning countries is critical for global cancer control.},

In this paper, we investigate how to utilize EHR to tailor treatments to individual patients based on their likelihood to respond to a therapy. We construct a heterogeneous graph which includes two domains (patients and drugs) and encodes three relationships (patient similarity, drug similarity, and patient-drug prior associations). We describe a novel approach for performing a label propagation procedure to spread the label information representing the effectiveness of different drugs for different patients over this heterogeneous graph. The proposed method has been applied on a real-world EHR dataset to help identify personalized treatments for hypercholesterolemia. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach and suggest that the combination of appropriate patient similarity and drug similarity analytics could lead to actionable insights for personalized medicine. Particularly, by leveraging drug similarity in combination with patient similarity, our method could perform well even on new or rarely used drugs for which there are few records of known past performance.},

	abstract = {Predicting patients' risk of developing certain diseases is an important research topic in healthcare. Accurately identifying and ranking the similarity among patients based on their historical records is a key step in personalized healthcare. The electric health records (EHRs), which are irregularly sampled and have varied patient visit lengths, cannot be directly used to measure patient similarity due to the lack of an appropriate representation. Moreover, there needs an effective approach to measure patient similarity on EHRs. In this paper, we propose two novel deep similarity learning frameworks which simultaneously learn patient representations and measure pairwise similarity. We use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to capture local important information in EHRs and then feed the learned representation into triplet loss or softmax cross entropy loss. After training, we can obtain pairwise distances and similarity scores. Utilizing the similarity information, we then perform disease predictions and patient clustering. Experimental results show that CNN can better represent the longitudinal EHR sequences, and our proposed frameworks outperform state-of-the-art distance metric learning methods.},

	abstract = {The automatic extraction of a patient’s natural history from Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is a critical step towards building intelligent systems that can reason about clinical variables and support decision making. Although EHRs contain a large amount of valuable information about the patient’s medical care, this information can only be fully understood when analyzed in a temporal context. Any intelligent system should then be able to extract medical concepts, date expressions, temporal relations and the temporal ordering of medical events from the free texts of EHRs; yet, this task is hard to tackle, due to the domain specific nature of EHRs, writing quality and lack of structure of these texts, and more generally the presence of redundant information. In this paper, we introduce a new Natural Language Processing (NLP) framework, capable of extracting the aforementioned elements from EHRs written in Spanish using rule-based methods. We focus on building medical timelines, which include disease diagnosis and its progression over time. By using a large dataset of EHRs comprising information about patients suffering from lung cancer, we show that our framework has an adequate level of performance by correctly building the timeline for 843 patients from a pool of 989 patients, achieving a precision of 0.852.},

	abstract = {Background
Individual participant data meta-analyses of postoperative chemotherapy have shown improved survival for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We aimed to do a systematic review and individual participant data meta-analysis to establish the effect of preoperative chemotherapy for patients with resectable NSCLC.

Methods
We systematically searched for trials that started after January, 1965. Updated individual participant data were centrally collected, checked, and analysed. Results from individual randomised controlled trials (both published and unpublished) were combined using a two-stage fixed-effect model. Our primary outcome, overall survival, was defined as the time from randomisation until death (any cause), with living patients censored on the date of last follow-up. Secondary outcomes were recurrence-free survival, time to locoregional and distant recurrence, cause-specific survival, complete and overall resection rates, and postoperative mortality. Prespecified analyses explored any variation in effect by trial and patient characteristics. All analyses were by intention to treat.

Findings
Analyses of 15 randomised controlled trials (2385 patients) showed a significant benefit of preoperative chemotherapy on survival (hazard ratio [HR] 0·87, 95\% CI 0·78–0·96, p=0·007), a 13\% reduction in the relative risk of death (no evidence of a difference between trials; p=0·18, I2=25\%). This finding represents an absolute survival improvement of 5\% at 5 years, from 40\% to 45\%. There was no clear evidence of a difference in the effect on survival by chemotherapy regimen or scheduling, number of drugs, platinum agent used, or whether postoperative radiotherapy was given. There was no clear evidence that particular types of patient defined by age, sex, performance status, histology, or clinical stage benefited more or less from preoperative chemotherapy. Recurrence-free survival (HR 0·85, 95\% CI 0·76–0·94, p=0·002) and time to distant recurrence (0·69, 0·58–0·82, p{\textless}0·0001) results were both significantly in favour of preoperative chemotherapy although most patients included were stage IB–IIIA. Results for time to locoregional recurrence (0·88, 0·73–1·07, p=0·20), although in favour of preoperative chemotherapy, were not statistically significant.

Interpretation
Findings, which are based on 92\% of all patients who were randomised, and mainly stage IB–IIIA, show preoperative chemotherapy significantly improves overall survival, time to distant recurrence, and recurrence-free survival in resectable NSCLC. The findings suggest this is a valid treatment option for most of these patients. Toxic effects could not be assessed.

	abstract = {Background
Retrospective evidence indicates that disease progression after first-line chemotherapy for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) occurs most often at sites of disease known to exist at baseline. However, the potential benefit of aggressive local consolidative therapy (LCT) on progression-free survival (PFS) for patients with oligometastatic NSCLC is unknown.

Methods
We conducted a multicenter randomized study (NCT01725165; currently ongoing but not recruiting participants) to assess the effect of LCT on progression-free survival ((PFS). Eligible patients hadwere (1) histologic confirmation of (2) stage IV NSCLC, (3) ≤3 disease sites after systemic therapy, and (4) no disease progression before randomization. Front line therapy was ≥4 cycles of platinum doublet therapy or ≥3 months of inhibitors of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) for patients with EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements. Patients were randomized to either LCT ([chemo]radiation or resection of all lesions) +/− maintenance therapy versus maintenance therapy/observation only. Maintenance therapy was recommended based on a list of approved regimens, and observation was defined as close surveillance without cytotoxic therapy. Randomization was not masked and was balanced dynamically on five factors: number of metastases, response to initial therapy, central nervous system metastases, intrathoracic nodal status, and EGFR/ALK status. The primary endpoint was PFS, powered to detect an increase from 4 months to 7 months (hazard ratio [HR\vphantom{\{}\}=0.57) using intent-to-treat analysis. The plan was to study 94 randomized patients, with an interim analysis at 44 events. PFS, overall survival (OS), and time to develop a new lesion were compared between arms with log-rank tests.

Results
The study was terminated early after treatment of 49 patients (25 LCT, 24 control), when at a median follow-up time for PFS of 18.7 months, the median PFS time in the LCT group was 11.9 months (90\% confidence interval [CI] 5.72 ,20.90) versus 3.9 months (90\% CI 2.30, 6.64) in the maintenance group (HR=0.35, 90\% CI 0.18,0.66, log rank p=0.005). Toxicity was similar between groups, with no grade 4–5 events. Grade 3 or higher adverse events in the maintenance therapy arm were fatigue (n=1) and anemia (n=1). In the LCT arm, Grade 3 events were: esophagitis (n=2), anemia (n=1), pneumothorax (n=1), and abdominal pain (n=1). Overall survival data are immature, with only 14 deaths recorded.

Interpretation
LCT +/− maintenance therapy for patients with ≤3 metastases from NSCLC that did not progress after initial systemic therapy improved PFS relative to maintenance therapy alone. These findings imply that aggressive local therapy should be further explored in phase III trials as a standard treatment option in this clinical scenario.},

	abstract = {The oligometastatic state represents a distinct entity among those with metastatic disease and consists of patients with metastases limited in number and location, representing an intermediate state between locally confined and widely metastatic cancer. Although similar, “oligorecurrence” (limited number of metachronous metastases under conditions of a controlled primary lesion) and “oligoprogressive” (disease progression at a limited number of sites with disease controlled at other disease sites) states are distinct entities. In non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the oligometastatic state is relatively common, with 20\% to 50\% of patients having oligometastatic disease at diagnosis. This subgroup of patients when receiving ablative therapy, such as surgery or stereotactic body radiation radiotherapy, can obtain markedly long progression-free and overall survival. The role of radical treatment for intracranial oligometastases is well established. Fewer data exist regarding radical treatment of extracranial metastases in lung cancer; however, retrospective series using surgery or stereotactic body radiotherapy for extracranial oligometastatic disease in NSCLC have shown excellent local control, with a suggestion of improvement in progression-free survival. In the present report, we have reviewed the data on the treatment of brain metastases in oligometastatic NSCLC and the results of ablative treatment of extracranial sites. Recently, the first randomized trial comparing ablative treatment versus control in oligometastatic disease was reported, and those data are reviewed in the context of smaller series. Finally, areas of controversy are discussed and a therapeutic approach for patients with oligometastatic disease is proposed.},

	abstract = {The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual has become the benchmark for classifying patients with cancer, defining prognosis, and determining the best treatment approaches. Many view the primary role of the tumor, lymph node, metastasis (TNM) system as that of a standardized classification system for evaluating cancer at a population level in terms of the extent of disease, both at initial presentation and after surgical treatment, and the overall impact of improvements in cancer treatment. The rapid evolution of knowledge in cancer biology and the discovery and validation of biologic factors that predict cancer outcome and response to treatment with better accuracy have led some cancer experts to question the utility of a TNM-based approach in clinical care at an individualized patient level. In the Eighth Edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, the goal of including relevant, nonanatomic (including molecular) factors has been foremost, although changes are made only when there is strong evidence for inclusion. The editorial board viewed this iteration as a proactive effort to continue to build the important bridge from a “population-based” to a more “personalized” approach to patient classification, one that forms the conceptual framework and foundation of cancer staging in the era of precision molecular oncology. The AJCC promulgates best staging practices through each new edition in an effort to provide cancer care providers with a powerful, knowledge-based resource for the battle against cancer. In this commentary, the authors highlight the overall organizational and structural changes as well as “what's new” in the Eighth Edition. It is hoped that this information will provide the reader with a better understanding of the rationale behind the aggregate proposed changes and the exciting developments in the upcoming edition.

	abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women. Clinical staging plays a crucial role in predicting survivor as well as influencing management option in lung cancer patients. Guidelines are constantly being reviewed as more data becomes available to provide the most accurate prognostic markers, hence aiding in the clinical detection and staging of lung cancer. Since its introduction in the 1970s, the TNM staging has undergone significant revisions with the latest, 8th edition, being effective internationally from 2018. This edition re-categorizes the tumour size and other non-quantitative tumour descriptors (T), and further subclassifies extra-thoracic metastases (M). The clinical nodal (N) classifier is unchanged as the earlier version correlates well with prognosis. The downstream effects on staging to accommodate for the new T and M classifications are highlighted. The survival is inversely proportional to every centimeter increase in tumour size up till 7 cm, where the same prognosis as a T4 disease is reached. Hence, some of the T-classifiers based on size of the tumour is upstaged to reflect that. Invasion of the diaphragm is considered T4 instead of T3. On the other hand, involvement of the main bronchus regardless of tumour distance to carina as well as atelectasis is down-staged from a T3 to a T2 disease. Since the 7th edition, new entities of lung tumour known as adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) have been introduced. The T-defining features are also described in this manuscript. Extrathoracic metastases that were classified as M1b in the 7th edition is further subcategorized into M1b and M1c in the 8th edition, to better define oligometastasis which has a better prognosis, and may benefit from more aggressive local therapy. This overview aims to provide radiologists with a description of the changes in the latest edition including staging of subsolid and multiple nodules, outline potential limitations of this 8th edition, as well as discussion on the implications on treatment.},

Joinpoint analysis was used to extend international lung cancer incidence rates by the latest data from Cancer Incidence in Five Continents over the 35-year period 1973–2007 from 24 populations from Americas, Asia, Europe, and Oceania. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASRs) of lung cancer were from 33.3 to 66.8 per 100,000 among males and 10.5 to 37.4 per 100,000 among females in most of Americas, Europe, and Oceania populations during the period 2003–2007. In Asia, ASRs in China (Hong Kong) were the highest, up to 53.3 per 100,000 in males and 21.9 per 100,000 in females during the period 2003–2007. The international trends between 1973 and 2007 showed that ASRs of lung cancer among males were declining in 13 of 18 selected Americas, Oceania, and Europe populations, with AAPC from −0.7\% to −2.9\%, whereas the rates among females in 18 selected populations were increasing, with AAPC from 1.3\% to 5.0\%. The increasing and decreasing trends of ASRs of lung cancer in Asia have a geographic variation but no gender differences. Although the decreasing trends in ASRs of lung cancer for males were observed, the ASRs were higher than females. The declining trends in males were mainly attributed to tobacco control, whereas the increasing trends in females should be given more concern and need to be further studied in etiology factors.},

Incidence data (through 2017) were collected by the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program; the National Program of Cancer Registries; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. Mortality data (through 2018) were collected by the National Center for Health Statistics. In 2021, 1,898,160 new cancer cases and 608,570 cancer deaths are projected to occur in the United States. After increasing for most of the 20th century, the cancer death rate has fallen continuously from its peak in 1991 through 2018, for a total decline of 31\%, because of reductions in smoking and improvements in early detection and treatment. This translates to 3.2 million fewer cancer deaths than would have occurred if peak rates had persisted. Long-term declines in mortality for the 4 leading cancers have halted for prostate cancer and slowed for breast and colorectal cancers, but accelerated for lung cancer, which accounted for almost one-half of the total mortality decline from 2014 to 2018. The pace of the annual decline in lung cancer mortality doubled from 3.1\% during 2009 through 2013 to 5.5\% during 2014 through 2018 in men, from 1.8\% to 4.4\% in women, and from 2.4\% to 5\% overall. This trend coincides with steady declines in incidence (2.2\%-2.3\%) but rapid gains in survival specifically for nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). For example, NSCLC 2-year relative survival increased from 34\% for persons diagnosed during 2009 through 2010 to 42\% during 2015 through 2016, including absolute increases of 5\% to 6\% for every stage of diagnosis; survival for small cell lung cancer remained at 14\% to 15\%. Improved treatment accelerated progress against lung cancer and drove a record drop in overall cancer mortality, despite slowing momentum for other common cancers.},

	abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. From the estimation of cases that will be in 2021, more than 230,000 new cases are expected to be of lung cancer patients, with an estimation of more than 131,000 deaths. Improving the survival rates or the patient's quality of life is partially covered by a common element: treatments. Collective knowledge about cancer treatment recommendations is typically included in clinical guidelines, intended to optimize patient care and assist clinicians in lung cancer treatment. These guidelines define a set of treatment paths, where recommendations depend on cancer disease aspects and individual features for a concrete patient. Although oncologists are expected to follow clinical guidelines, the inter and intrapatients' variability of response to the possible treatment combinations, makes it necessary to personalize different treatment-patterns on certain cases. Additionally, clinical guidelines are not frequently updated with new findings or lack a consistent methodology when they are frequently updated. For that reason, the analysis of patterns on both patients treated following the standard of care, or outside it, would allow to validate clinical guidelines and identify potential new treatment recommendations. In this work, we have analysed whether actual treatments prescribed to lung cancer patients follow clinical guidelines or not. Using a machine learning method that provides as output association rules (Apriori), we identify patterns based on cancer stage. These preliminary results show that treatments patterns found mostly match with clinical guidelines recommendations, validating the information included in the consulted guidelines.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ALEX study demonstrated significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) with alectinib versus crizotinib in treatment-naive ALK-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) at the primary data cut-off (9 February 2017). We report mature PFS (cut-off: 30 November 2018) and overall survival (OS) data up to 5 years (cut-off: 29 November 2019).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with stage III/IV ALK-positive NSCLC were randomized to receive twice-daily alectinib 600 mg (n = 152) or crizotinib 250 mg (n = 151) until disease progression, toxicity, withdrawal or death. Primary end point: investigator-assessed PFS. Secondary end points included objective response rate, OS and safety.
RESULTS: Mature PFS data showed significantly prolonged investigator-assessed PFS with alectinib [hazard ratio (HR) 0.43, 95\% confidence interval (CI) 0.32-0.58; median PFS 34.8 versus 10.9 months crizotinib]. Median duration of OS follow-up: 48.2 months alectinib, 23.3 months crizotinib. OS data remain immature (37\% of events). Median OS was not reached with alectinib versus 57.4 months with crizotinib (stratified HR 0.67, 95\% CI 0.46-0.98). The 5-year OS rate was 62.5\% (95\% CI 54.3-70.8) with alectinib and 45.5\% (95\% CI 33.6-57.4) with crizotinib, with 34.9\% and 8.6\% of patients still on study treatment, respectively. The OS benefit of alectinib was seen in patients with central nervous system metastases at baseline [HR 0.58 (95\% CI 0.34-1.00)] and those without [HR 0.76 (95\% CI 0.45-1.26)]. Median treatment duration was longer with alectinib (28.1 versus 10.8 months), and no new safety signals were observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Mature PFS data from ALEX confirmed significant improvement in PFS for alectinib over crizotinib in ALK-positive NSCLC. OS data remain immature, with a higher 5-year OS rate with alectinib versus crizotinib. This is the first global randomized study to show clinically meaningful improvement in OS for a next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitor versus crizotinib in treatment-naive ALK-positive NSCLC.

METHODS: Pretreated (cohort B) and treatment-naive (cohort C) patients with BRAF V600E-mutant mNSCLC received dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily and trametinib 2 mg once daily. The primary end point was investigator-assessed overall response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1. Secondary end points were duration of response, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety.
RESULTS: At data cutoff, for cohorts B (57 patients) and C (36 patients), the median follow-up was 16.6 (range: 0.5-78.5) and 16.3 (range: 0.4-80) months, overall response rate (95\% confidence interval [CI]) was 68.4\% (54.8-80.1) and 63.9\% (46.2-79.2), median progression-free survival (95\% CI) was 10.2 (6.9-16.7) and 10.8 (7.0-14.5) months, and median overall survival (95\% CI) was 18.2 (14.3-28.6) and 17.3 (12.3-40.2) months, respectively. The 4- and 5-year survival rates were 26\% and 19\% in pretreated patients and 34\% and 22\% in treatment-naive patients, respectively. A total of 17 patients (18\%) were still alive. The most frequent adverse event was pyrexia (56\%). Exploratory genomic analysis indicated that the presence of coexisting genomic alterations might influence clinical outcomes in these patients; however, these results require further investigation.
CONCLUSIONS: Dabrafenib plus trametinib therapy was found to have substantial and durable clinical benefit, with a manageable safety profile, in patients with BRAF V600E-mutant mNSCLC, regardless of previous treatment.},

We report updated results, including a pooled analysis of the two studies. Methods Patients with stage IIIB/IV squamous (N = 272) or nonsquamous (N = 582) NSCLC and disease progression during or after prior platinum-based chemotherapy were randomly assigned 1:1 to nivolumab (3 mg/kg every 2 weeks) or docetaxel (75 mg/m2 every 3 weeks). Minimum follow-up for survival was 24.2 months. Results Two-year overall survival rates with nivolumab versus docetaxel were 23\% (95\% CI, 16\% to 30\%) versus 8\% (95\% CI, 4\% to 13\%) in squamous NSCLC and 29\% (95\% CI, 24\% to 34\%) versus 16\% (95\% CI, 12\% to 20\%) in nonsquamous NSCLC; relative reductions in the risk of death with nivolumab versus docetaxel remained similar to those reported in the primary analyses. Durable responses were observed with nivolumab; 10 (37\%) of 27 confirmed responders with squamous NSCLC and 19 (34\%) of 56 with nonsquamous NSCLC had ongoing responses after 2 years' minimum follow-up. No patient in either docetaxel group had an ongoing response. In the pooled analysis, the relative reduction in the risk of death with nivolumab versus docetaxel was 28\% (hazard ratio, 0.72; 95\% CI, 0.62 to 0.84), and rates of treatment-related adverse events were lower with nivolumab than with docetaxel (any grade, 68\% v 88\%; grade 3 to 4, 10\% v 55\%). Conclusion Nivolumab provides long-term clinical benefit and a favorable tolerability profile compared with docetaxel in previously treated patients with advanced NSCLC.},

METHODS: Patients with stage IV NSCLC treated with an ALK inhibitor at the University of Colorado Cancer Center from 2009 through November 2017 were identified retrospectively. OS curves were constructed by using Kaplan-Meier methods. Multivariate Cox proportional hazard analysis was used to determine the relationship of variables with OS.
RESULTS: Of the 110 patients with ALK-positive NSCLC who were identified, 105 received crizotinib as their initial ALK inhibitor. With a median follow-up time of 47 months, the median OS time from diagnosis of stage IV disease was 81 months (6.8 years). Brain metastases at diagnosis of stage IV disease (hazard ratio = 1.01, p = 0.971) and year of stage IV presentation (p = 0.887) did not influence OS. More organs with tumor at diagnosis of stage IV disease was associated with worse OS (HR = 1.49 for each additional organ with disease, including the CNS [p = 0.002]). Each additional month of pemetrexed-based therapy was associated with a 7\% relative decrease in risk of death.
CONCLUSION: Patients with stage IV ALK-positive NSCLC can have prolonged OS. Brain metastases at diagnosis of stage IV disease does not influence OS. Having more organs involved with tumor at stage IV presentation is associated with worse outcomes. Prolonged benefit from pemetrexed is associated with better outcomes.},

Background: Although patient questionnaires are commonly used to assess healthcare experiences (e.g., satisfaction with care), patient-reported outcome (PRO) measures assessing symptoms and physical functioning have not conventionally been used for quality assessment. More typically, quality of care is measured with administrative data, such as hospital readmission rates. There is an opportunity to advance the science of quality measurement by integrating a patient-centered approach. Methods: ASCO established a multi-stakeholder PRO Workgroup (including extensive patient input) to develop and test PRO-based performance measures (PRO-PMs). The ASCO PRO Workgroup outlined three initial PRO-PMs to test for patients receiving moderately/highly emetogenic chemotherapy: 1) process: proportion self-reporting symptoms at, or within 2 weeks, of last visit; 2) outcome: proportion experiencing moderate/high levels of nausea; and 3) outcome: proportion reporting moderate/high pain. We will give an update on progress of the ASCO PRO Workgroup and outline next steps needed to implement PRO measures as a quality metric. Results: Three key methodological advancements are needed before PRO measures can be used as a quality metric. First, areas of cancer care delivery need to be identified that are important to patients when considering quality of care and are amenable to performance evaluation with PRO measures (e.g., symptom control). Second, existing PRO questionnaires need to be systematically identified and evaluated for potential quality use. The review should evaluate psychometric properties, validity and reliability, and feasibility for clinical use. Third, testing is needed in representative practice settings to iteratively refine: 1) logistical strategy for systematically collecting this information at the practice level; 2) approaches for minimizing missing data, particularly from underserved populations; and 3) adjustments for patient characteristics (case-mix). Conclusions: Methodological advancements are necessary before PRO measures can be implemented as a quality metric. PRO measures have the potential to provide quality assessments that are useful to patients making health care decisions.},

	abstract = {Rationale: The level of adherence to lung cancer treatment guidelines in the United States is unclear. In addition, it is unclear whether previously identified disparities by racial or ethnic group and by age persist across all clinical subgroups.Objectives: To assess the level of adherence to the minimal lung cancer treatment recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines (guideline-concordant treatment) in the United States, and to assess the persistence of disparities by racial or ethnic group and by age across all clinical subgroups.Methods: We evaluated whether 441,812 lung cancer cases in the National Cancer Database diagnosed between 2010 and 2014 received guideline-concordant treatment. Logistic regression models were used to assess possible disparities in receiving guideline-concordant treatment by racial or ethnic group and by age across all clinical subgroups, and whether these persist after adjusting for patient, tumor, and health care provider characteristics.Results: Overall, 62.1\% of subjects received guideline-concordant treatment (range across clinical subgroups = 50.4-76.3\%). However, 21.6\% received no treatment (range = 10.3-31.4\%) and 16.3\% received less intensive treatment than recommended (range = 6.4-21.6\%). Among the most common less intensive treatments for all subgroups was "conventionally fractionated radiotherapy only" (range = 2.5-16.0\%), as was "chemotherapy only" for nonmetastatic subgroups (range = 1.2-13.7\%), and "conventionally fractionated radiotherapy and chemotherapy" for localized non-small-cell lung cancer (5.9\%). Guideline-concordant treatment was less likely with increasing age, despite adjusting for relevant covariates (age ≥ 80 yr compared with {\textless}50 yr: adjusted odds ratio = 0.12, 95\% confidence interval = 0.12-0.13). This disparity was present in all clinical subgroups. In addition, non-Hispanic black patients were less likely to receive guideline-concordant treatment than non-Hispanic white patients (adjusted odds ratio = 0.78, 95\% confidence interval = 0.76-0.80). This disparity was present in all clinical subgroups, although statistically nonsignificant for extensive disease small-cell lung cancer.Conclusions: Between 2010 and 2014, many patients with lung cancer in the United States received no treatment or less intensive treatment than recommended. Particularly, elderly patients with lung cancer and non-Hispanic black patients are less likely to receive guideline-concordant treatment. Patterns of care among those receiving less intensive treatment than recommended suggest room for improved uptake of treatments such as stereotactic body radiation therapy for subjects with localized non-small-cell lung cancer.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The role of pre-operative chemotherapy in the treatment of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was not clear. A systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis were therefore undertaken to evaluate the available evidence from randomised trials.
OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effect of pre-operative chemotherapy on survival in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. If adequate data are available, to investigate whether or not pre-defined patient subgroups benefit more or less from pre-operative chemotherapy.
SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE and CANCERLIT searches for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) were supplemented by information from trial registers and by handsearching relevant meeting proceedings and by discussion with relevant trialists and organisations.
SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs were eligible for inclusion provided the patients had been randomised between chemotherapy followed by surgery versus surgery alone and that the method of randomisation precluded prior knowledge of the treatment to be assigned.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: A systematic review and meta-analysis based on aggregate data extracted from trial publications was carried out to assess the effectiveness of pre-operative chemotherapy in NSCLC. This involved identifying eligible RCTs and extracting aggregate data from the abstracts or reports of these RCTs. Hazard ratios were calculated from published summary statistics and then combined to give pooled estimates of treatment efficacy.
MAIN RESULTS: Twelve eligible RCTs were identified. Data were available from seven RCTs including 988 patients (75\% of eligible patients). Pre-operative chemotherapy increased survival with a hazard ratio of 0.82 (95\%CI 0.69-0.97) P = 0.022. This is equivalent to an absolute benefit of 6\%, increasing overall survival across all stages of disease from 14\% to 20\% at 5 years. There was no evidence of statistical heterogeneity (P = 0.980, I(2 )= 0).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This analysis shows a significant increase in survival attributable to pre-operative chemotherapy. This is currently the best estimate of the effectiveness of this therapy, but is based on a small number of trials and patients. This analysis was unable to address important questions such as whether particular types of patients may benefit more or less from pre-operative chemotherapy or whether the early stopping of a number of included RCTs impacted on the results. These issues may be addressed by an ongoing individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION/BACKGROUND: An individual patient data metaanalysis was performed to determine clinical outcomes, and to propose a risk stratification system, related to the comprehensive treatment of patients with oligometastatic NSCLC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: After a systematic review of the literature, data were obtained on 757 NSCLC patients with 1 to 5 synchronous or metachronous metastases treated with surgical metastectomy, stereotactic radiotherapy/radiosurgery, or radical external-beam radiotherapy, and curative treatment of the primary lung cancer, from hospitals worldwide. Factors predictive of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival were evaluated using Cox regression. Risk groups were defined using recursive partitioning analysis (RPA). Analyses were conducted on training and validating sets (two-thirds and one-third of patients, respectively).
RESULTS: Median OS was 26 months, 1-year OS 70.2\%, and 5-year OS 29.4\%. Surgery was the most commonly used treatment for the primary tumor (635 patients [83.9\%]) and metastases (339 patients [62.3\%]). Factors predictive of OS were: synchronous versus metachronous metastases (P {\textless} .001), N-stage (P = .002), and adenocarcinoma histology (P = .036); the model remained predictive in the validation set (c-statistic = 0.682). In RPA, 3 risk groups were identified: low-risk, metachronous metastases (5-year OS, 47.8\%); intermediate risk, synchronous metastases and N0 disease (5-year OS, 36.2\%); and high risk, synchronous metastases and N1/N2 disease (5-year OS, 13.8\%).
CONCLUSION: Significant OS differences were observed in oligometastatic patients stratified according to type of metastatic presentation, and N status. Long-term survival is common in selected patients with metachronous oligometastases. We propose this risk classification scheme be used in guiding selection of patients for clinical trials of ablative treatment.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE Pembrolizumab monotherapy has demonstrated durable antitumor activity in advanced programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)–expressing non‒small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We report 5-year outcomes from the phase Ib KEYNOTE-001 study. These data provide the longest efficacy and safety follow-up for patients with NSCLC treated with pembrolizumab monotherapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS Eligible patients had confirmed locally advanced/metastatic NSCLC and provided a contemporaneous tumor sample for PD-L1 evaluation by immunohistochemistry using the 22C3 antibody. Patients received intravenous pembrolizumab 2 mg/kg every 3 weeks or 10 mg/kg every 2 or 3 weeks. Investigators assessed response per immune-related response criteria. The primary efficacy end point was objective response rate. Overall survival (OS) and duration of response were secondary end points. RESULTS We enrolled 101 treatment-naive and 449 previously treated patients. Median follow-up was 60.6 months (range, 51.8 to 77.9 months). At data cutoff—November 5, 2018—450 patients (82\%) had died. Median OS was 22.3 months (95\% CI, 17.1 to 32.3 months) in treatment-naive patients and 10.5 months (95\% CI, 8.6 to 13.2 months) in previously treated patients. Estimated 5-year OS was 23.2\% for treatment-naive patients and 15.5\% for previously treated patients. In patients with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 50\% or greater, 5-year OS was 29.6\% and 25.0\% in treatment-naive and previously treated patients, respectively. Compared with analysis at 3 years, only three new-onset treatment-related grade 3 adverse events occurred (hypertension, glucose intolerance, and hypersensitivity reaction, all resolved). No late-onset grade 4 or 5 treatment-related adverse events occurred. CONCLUSION Pembrolizumab monotherapy provided durable antitumor activity and high 5-year OS rates in patients with treatment-naive or previously treated advanced NSCLC. Of note, the 5-year OS rate exceeded 25\% among patients with a PD-L1 tumor proportion score of 50\% or greater. Pembrolizumab had a tolerable long-term safety profile with little evidence of late-onset or new toxicity.},

	abstract = {Importance: Previous comparisons of surgery and stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for early-stage (ES) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) did not account for the extent of regional lymph node examination (LNE) during surgery.
Objective: To compare long-term overall survival (OS) of patients with ES NSCLC after surgery vs SBRT when the extent of regional LNE in patients undergoing surgery is thoroughly considered.
Design, Setting, and Participants: Cohort study with survival comparisons using the multivariable Cox proportional hazards model and after propensity score matching. Data from the National Cancer Database were analyzed from October 28, 2018, through April 18, 2019. Patients with ES NSCLC diagnosed between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2015, who underwent any curative-intent surgery or SBRT were included.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Long-term OS.
Results: Of 104 709 total patients, 91 330 underwent surgery (42 508 [46.5\%] male; median [interquartile range] age, 68 [61-75] years) and 13 379 received SBRT (6065 [45.3\%] male; median [interquartile range] age, 75 [68-81] years). Surgery, especially lobectomy (hazard ratio [HR], 0.53; 95\% CI, 0.50-0.56), and regional LNE, especially when more than 10 lymph nodes were examined (HR, 0.73; 95\% CI, 0.69-0.77), were associated with better long-term OS (P {\textless} .001). Pneumonectomy was not associated with reduced mortality risk when 0 nodes were examined (HR for stage T1, 1.43; 95\% CI, 0.67-3.06; P = .35; HR for stage T2-T3, 0.62; 95\% CI, 0.34-1.13; P = .12) or when more than 15 nodes were examined for stage T1 disease in patients younger than 80 years (HR, 0.77; 95\% CI, 0.54-1.09; P = .14) or when patients aged 80 years or older received regional LNE of any extent ({\textgreater}15 nodes examined: HR for stage T1, 0.65; 95\% CI, 0.16-2.64; P = .54; HR for stage T2-T3, 0.90; 95\% CI, 0.50-1.60; P = .71). Less extensive surgery was not associated with improved OS when 0 nodes were examined in patients aged 80 years or older with stage T2 to T3 tumors (HR for lobectomy, 0.90; 95\% CI, 0.65-1.25; P = .53) and in selected operable patients older than 75 years with stage T1 tumors (HR for lobectomy, 1.07; 95\% CI, 0.57-2.00; P = .84).
Conclusions and Relevance: This study found that, overall, surgery coupled with regional LNE of appropriate extent was associated with the best long-term OS in patients with ES NSCLC.},

However, there is considerable ambiguity concerning the exact meaning of the term and the optimum method of measuring the process and outcomes of patient-centred care. This paper reviews the conceptual and empirical literature in order to develop a model of the various aspects of the doctor-patient relationship encompassed by the concept of 'patient-centredness' and to assess the advantages and disadvantages of alternative methods of measurement. Five conceptual dimensions are identified: biopsychosocial perspective; 'patient-as-person'; sharing power and responsibility; therapeutic alliance; and 'doctor-as-person'. Two main approaches to measurement are evaluated: self-report instruments and external observation methods. A number of recommendations concerning the measurement of patient-centredness are made.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Osimertinib is a third-generation, irreversible tyrosine kinase inhibitor of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR-TKI) that selectively inhibits both EGFR-TKI–sensitizing and EGFR T790M resistance mutations. A phase 3 trial compared firstline osimertinib with other EGFR-TKIs in patients with EGFR mutation–positive advanced non–small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The trial showed longer progressionfree survival with osimertinib than with the comparator EGFR-TKIs (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.46). Data from the final analysis of overall survival have not been reported. The authors’ full names, academic degrees, and affiliations are listed in the Appendix.

METHODS In this trial, we randomly assigned 556 patients with previously untreated advanced NSCLC with an EGFR mutation (exon 19 deletion or L858R allele) in a 1:1 ratio to receive either osimertinib (80 mg once daily) or one of two other EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib at a dose of 250 mg once daily or erlotinib at a dose of 150 mg once daily, with patients receiving these drugs combined in a single comparator group). Overall survival was a secondary end point. This article was published on November 21, 2019, and updated on December 4, 2019, at NEJM.org. N Engl J Med 2020;382:41-50. DOI: 10.1056/NEJMoa1913662 Copyright © 2019 Massachusetts Medical Society.
RESULTS The median overall survival was 38.6 months (95\% confidence interval [CI], 34.5 to 41.8) in the osimertinib group and 31.8 months (95\% CI, 26.6 to 36.0) in the comparator group (hazard ratio for death, 0.80; 95.05\% CI, 0.64 to 1.00; P = 0.046). At 3 years, 79 of 279 patients (28\%) in the osimertinib group and 26 of 277 (9\%) in the comparator group were continuing to receive a trial regimen; the median exposure was 20.7 months and 11.5 months, respectively. Adverse events of grade 3 or higher were reported in 42\% of the patients in the osimertinib group and in 47\% of those in the comparator group.
CONCLUSIONS Among patients with previously untreated advanced NSCLC with an EGFR mutation, those who received osimertinib had longer overall survival than those who received a comparator EGFR-TKI. The safety profile for osimertinib was similar to that of the comparator EGFR-TKIs, despite a longer duration of exposure in the osimertinib group.

            Feature selection is a pre-processing technique used to remove unnecessary characteristics, and speed up the algorithm's work process. A part of the technique is carried out by calculating the information gain value of each dataset characteristic. Also, the determined threshold rate from the information gain value is used in feature selection. However, the threshold value is used freely or through a rate of 0.05. Therefore this study proposed the threshold rate determination using the information gain value’s standard deviation generated by each feature in the dataset. The threshold value determination was tested on 10 original datasets transformed by FFT and IFFT and classified using Random Forest. On processing the transformed dataset with the proposed threshold this study resulted in lower accuracy and longer execution time compared to the same process with Correlation-Base Feature Selection (CBF) and a standard 0.05 threshold method. Similarly, the required accuracy value is lower when using transformed features. The study showed that by processing the original dataset with a standard deviation threshold resulted in better feature selection accuracy of Random Forest classification. Furthermore, by using the transformed feature with the proposed threshold excluding the imaginary numbers leads to a faster average time than the three methods compared.},

Abundant literature has been dedicated to this research and tremendous progress has been made, ranging from efficient and scalable algorithms for frequent itemset mining in transaction databases to numerous research frontiers, such as sequential pattern mining, structured pattern mining, correlation mining, associative classification, and frequent pattern-based clustering, as well as their broad applications. In this article, we provide a brief overview of the current status of frequent pattern mining and discuss a few promising research directions. We believe that frequent pattern mining research has substantially broadened the scope of data analysis and will have deep impact on data mining methodologies and applications in the long run. However, there are still some challenging research issues that need to be solved before frequent pattern mining can claim a cornerstone approach in data mining applications.},

The main step of the subgroup discovery process, the induction of subgroup descriptions, is performed by a heuristic beam search algorithm, using a novel parametrized definition of rule quality which is analyzed in detail. The other important steps of the proposed subgroup discovery process are the detection of statistically significant properties of selected subgroups and subgroup visualization: statistically significant properties are used to enrich the descriptions of induced subgroups, while the visualization shows subgroup properties in the form of distributions of the numbers of examples in the subgroups. The approach is illustrated by the results obtained for a medical problem of early detection of patient risk groups.},

	shorttitle = {Mining social media},
	abstract = {Social media is the key component of social networks and organizational social applications. The emergence of new systems and services has created a number of novel social and ubiquitous environments for mining information, data, and, finally, knowledge. This connects but also transcends private and business applications featuring a range of different types of networks and organizational contexts. Important structures concern subgroups emerging in those applications as communities (connecting people), roles and key actors in the networks and communities, and opinions, beliefs, and sentiments of the set of actors. Collective intelligence can then be considered as an emerging phenomenon of the different interactions. This focus article considers mining approaches concerning social media in social networks and organizations and the analysis of such data. We first summarize important terms and concepts. Next, we describe and discuss key actor identification and characterization, sentiment mining and analysis, and community mining. In the sequel we consider different application areas and briefly discuss two exemplary ubiquitous and social applications—the social conference guidance system Conferator, and the {MyGroup} system for supporting working groups. Furthermore, we describe the {VIKAMINE} system for mining communities and subgroups in social media in the sketched application domains. Finally, we conclude with a discussion and outlook. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

	doi = {10.1109/TII.2014.2311968},
	abstract = {This work presents data mining methods for discovering unusual consumption patterns and their associated descriptive models from smart electricity meter data. At present, data mining and knowledge discovery in electricity meter data suffer from three notable weaknesses: 1) insufficient focus on intelligent data analysis of subgroups (subsets) whose patterns vary significantly from aggregate patterns embodied in an entire dataset; 2) a lack of effort towards generating intuitively understandable and practically applicable knowledge for industrial practitioners to identify such subgroups; and 3) limited knowledge regarding the link between unusual consumption patterns and household consumers' socio-demographic characteristics. This paper addresses these practically important but technically challenging issues by applying subgroup discovery algorithms to a real smart electricity meter dataset. Subgroups whose patterns are unusual and whose sizes are large enough are discovered, and their descriptive and predictive models are generated. Furthermore, to enrich subgroup discovery algorithms, three new-quality measures for real-valued targets are proposed. The comparative studies empirically evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of subgroup discovery on classification accuracy, predictive power, and computational resources. The methodologies and algorithms presented are generic, and therefore applicable to a wider range of data mining problems.},
