	abstract = {The American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging manual has become the benchmark for classifying patients with cancer, defining prognosis, and determining the best treatment approaches. Many view the primary role of the tumor, lymph node, metastasis (TNM) system as that of a standardized classification system for evaluating cancer at a population level in terms of the extent of disease, both at initial presentation and after surgical treatment, and the overall impact of improvements in cancer treatment. The rapid evolution of knowledge in cancer biology and the discovery and validation of biologic factors that predict cancer outcome and response to treatment with better accuracy have led some cancer experts to question the utility of a TNM-based approach in clinical care at an individualized patient level. In the Eighth Edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual, the goal of including relevant, nonanatomic (including molecular) factors has been foremost, although changes are made only when there is strong evidence for inclusion. The editorial board viewed this iteration as a proactive effort to continue to build the important bridge from a “population-based” to a more “personalized” approach to patient classification, one that forms the conceptual framework and foundation of cancer staging in the era of precision molecular oncology. The AJCC promulgates best staging practices through each new edition in an effort to provide cancer care providers with a powerful, knowledge-based resource for the battle against cancer. In this commentary, the authors highlight the overall organizational and structural changes as well as “what's new” in the Eighth Edition. It is hoped that this information will provide the reader with a better understanding of the rationale behind the aggregate proposed changes and the exciting developments in the upcoming edition.

	abstract = {Abstract 
            Feature selection is a pre-processing technique used to remove unnecessary characteristics, and speed up the algorithm's work process. A part of the technique is carried out by calculating the information gain value of each dataset characteristic. Also, the determined threshold rate from the information gain value is used in feature selection. However, the threshold value is used freely or through a rate of 0.05. Therefore this study proposed the threshold rate determination using the information gain value’s standard deviation generated by each feature in the dataset. The threshold value determination was tested on 10 original datasets transformed by FFT and IFFT and classified using Random Forest. On processing the transformed dataset with the proposed threshold this study resulted in lower accuracy and longer execution time compared to the same process with Correlation-Base Feature Selection (CBF) and a standard 0.05 threshold method. Similarly, the required accuracy value is lower when using transformed features. The study showed that by processing the original dataset with a standard deviation threshold resulted in better feature selection accuracy of Random Forest classification. Furthermore, by using the transformed feature with the proposed threshold excluding the imaginary numbers leads to a faster average time than the three methods compared.},
