  "abstract": "In this work I discuss briefly the calculation of the algebraic entropy for systems of quad equations. In particular, I observe that since systems of multilinear equations can have algebraic solution, in some cases one might need to restrict the direction of evolution only to the pair of vertices yielding a birational evolution. Some examples from the exiting literature are presented and discussed within this framework.",
