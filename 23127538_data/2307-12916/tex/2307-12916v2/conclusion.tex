\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we study various relaxations of MMS. First we prove the existence of $1$-out-of-$4\ceil{\frac{n}{3}}$ MMS allocations which improves the state-of-the-art $1$-out-of-$\floor{\frac{3n}{2}}$ factor by~\cite{Hosseini2021OrdinalMS}. Since even the non-existence of $1$-out-of-$(n+1)$ MMS allocations is open to this date, one obvious future direction is to reduce the gap between the lower and upper bounds for ordinal MMS by improving either of the bounds.

Furthermore, we introduce a general framework of \emph{approximate MMS with agent priority ranking} which captures both ordinal approximation and multiplicative approximations of MMS as special cases. This framework introduces so many directions since by setting $T \defeq (\tau_1, \ldots, \tau_n)$ for different values of $\tau_1, \ldots, \tau_n$, different MMS guarantees would be addressed. In particular we prove the existence of $T$-MMS allocations where $\tau_i \ge \max(\frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{12n}, \frac{2n}{2n+i-1})$ for all $i$. 

Finally, by ordering the agents randomly, we can get allocations that are $(\frac{3}{4} + \frac{1}{12n})$-MMS ex-post and $(0.8253 + \frac{1}{36n})$-MMS ex-ante, touching upon the sought-after ``best-of-both-worlds'' guarantees. While improving the ex-post guarantee for MMS is very interesting and challenging on its own, improving ex-ante guatantees while having $\frac{3}{4}$-MMS ex-post is another interesting direction.
