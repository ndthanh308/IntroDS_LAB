\ordNorm*
\begin{proof}
    Let $\ins$ be an arbitrary instance. We create a $d$-normalized ordered instance $\mathcal{I}'' = (N, M, V'')$ such that from any $1$-out-of-$d$ MMS allocation for $\mathcal{I}''$, one can obtain a $1$-out-of-$d$ MMS allocation for the original instance $\mathcal{I}$.

    First of all, we can ignore all agents $i$ with $\MMS^d_i=0$ since no good needs to be allocated to them. Recall that for all $i \in N$, $P^i = (P^i_1, \ldots, P^i_d)$ is a $d$-MMS partition of agent $i$. For all $i \in N$ and $g \in M$, we define $v'_{i,g} = v_i(g)/v_i(P^i_j)$ where $j$ is such that $g \in P^i_j$. Now for all $i \in N$, let $v'_i: 2^M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ be defined as an additive function such that $v'_i(S)=\sum_{g \in S} v'_{i,g}$.  Note that $v'_{i,g} \leq v_i(g)/\MMS^d_i(M)$ for all $g \in M$ and thus,
    \begin{align}
        v_i(S) \geq v'_i(S) \cdot \MMS^d_i(M). \label{ineq-apx}
    \end{align}
    Since $v'_i(P^i_j)=1$ for all $i \in N$ and  $j \in [d]$, $\mathcal{I}' = (N, M, V')$ is a $d$-normalized instance. If a $1$-out-of-$d$ MMS allocation exists for $\mathcal{I}$, let $X$ be one such allocation. By Inequality \eqref{ineq-apx}, $v_i(X_i) \geq v'_i(X_i) \cdot \MMS^d_i(M) \geq \MMS^d_i(M)$. Thus, every allocation that is $1$-out-of-$d$ MMS for $\mathcal{I}'$ is $1$-out-of-$d$ MMS for $\mathcal{I}$ as well.
    For all agents $i$ and $g \in [m]$, let $v''_{i,g}$ be the $g$-th number in the multiset of $\{v_i(1), \ldots, v_i(m)\}$. Let $v''_i: 2^M \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$ be defined as an additive function such that $v''_i(S)=\sum_{g \in S} v''_{i,g}$. Let $\mathcal{I''} = (N,M,V'')$. Note that $\mathcal{I}''$ is ordered and $d$-normalized.
    Barman and Krishnamurthy \cite{barman2020approximation} proved that for any allocation $X$ in $\mathcal{I''}$, there exists and allocation $Y$ in $\mathcal{I'}$ such that $v'_i(Y_i) \geq v''_i(X_i)$. Therefore, from any $1$-out-of-$d$ MMS allocation in $\mathcal{I}''$, one can obtain a $1$-out-of-$d$ MMS allocation in $\mathcal{I'}$ and as already shown before, it gives a $1$-out-of-$d$ MMS allocation for $\mathcal{I}$.
\end{proof}
