  "abstract": "The availability of time-variability information of a channel between a network node and a user equipment at the network side allows a 5G network to optimally configure its parameters to maximize both user and system performance. In the Release 18 enhancements of 5G-Advanced, a time-domain channel property (TDCP) feedback that indicates the degree of time-variability of the channel is being standardized. In this article, we describe the standardized TDCP feedback and its applications. The benefit of the feedback is further illustrated through numerical evaluations.",
