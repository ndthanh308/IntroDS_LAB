  "abstract": "We consider a heavy external object moving in an ideal gas of light particles. Collisions with the gas particles transfer momentum to the object, leading to a force that is proportional to the object's velocity but in the opposite direction. In an ideal classical gas at temperature $T$, the force acting on the object is proportional to $\\sqrt{T}$. Quantum statistics causes a deviation from the $\\sqrt{T}$-dependence and shows that the force scales with $T^2$ at low temperatures. At $T=0$, the force vanishes in a Bose gas but is finite in a Fermi gas.",
