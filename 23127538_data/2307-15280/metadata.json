  "abstract": "In this study, we develop an active reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) prototype compliant with the 5G New Radio standard at 3.5~GHz. The experimental results clearly indicate that active RIS plays a vital role in enhancing MIMO performance, surpassing passive RIS. Furthermore, when considering factors such as complexity, energy consumption, and performance, the comparative evaluation between passive RIS and active RIS reinforces the critical role of active RIS in MIMO systems. These findings underscore the practical significance of active RIS in improving MIMO gain in 5G scenarios.",
