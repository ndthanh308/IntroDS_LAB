  "abstract": "This paper presents a global stability result on perturbations near a background magnetic field to the 2D incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations with only magnetic diffusion on the periodic domain. The stability result provides a significant example for the stabilizing effects of the magnetic field on electrically conducting fluids. In addition, we obtain an explicit large-time decay rate of the solutions.",
