  "abstract": "We introduce ÌròyìnSpeech, a new corpus influenced by the desire to increase the amount of high quality, contemporary Yorùbá speech data, which can be used for both Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) tasks. We curated about 23000 text sentences from news and creative writing domains with the open license CC-BY-4.0. To encourage a participatory approach to data creation, we provide 5000 curated sentences to the Mozilla Common Voice platform to crowd-source the recording and validation of Yorùbá speech data. In total, we created about 42 hours of speech data recorded by 80 volunteers in-house, and 6 hours of validated recordings on Mozilla Common Voice platform. Our TTS evaluation suggests that a high-fidelity, general domain, single-speaker Yorùbá voice is possible with as little as 5 hours of speech. Similarly, for ASR we obtained a baseline word error rate (WER) of 23.8.",
