  "abstract": "By chiral effects one understands manifestations of chiral gauge anomaly and of gravitational chiral anomaly in hydrodynamics. In recent two-three years our understanding of the chiral effects has considerably changed. Here we present mini-review of two topics. First, shift in understanding symmetry which underlies the chiral magnetic effect and, second, interpretation of the chiral kinematical effect uncovered recently.",
