  "abstract": "In e-commerce, head queries account for the vast majority of gross merchandise sales and improvements to head queries are highly impactful to the business. While most supervised approaches to search perform better in head queries vs. tail queries, we propose a method that further improves head query performance dramatically. We propose XWalk, a random-walk based graph approach to candidate retrieval for product search that borrows from recommendation system techniques. XWalk is highly efficient to train and inference in a large-scale high traffic e-commerce setting, and shows substantial improvements in head query performance over state-of-the-art neural retreivers. Ensembling XWalk with a neural and/or lexical retriever combines the best of both worlds and the resulting retrieval system outperforms all other methods in both offline relevance-based evaluation and in online A/B tests.",
