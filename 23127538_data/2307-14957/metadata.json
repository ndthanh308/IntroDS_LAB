  "abstract": "The structure of type A and B trace anomalies is reanalyzed in terms of the universal behaviour of dimension -2 invariant amplitudes. Based on it a general argument for trace anomaly matching between the unbroken and broken phases of a CFT is given. The structure of moduli trace anomalies and their transformations under source reparametrizations is discussed in detail.",
