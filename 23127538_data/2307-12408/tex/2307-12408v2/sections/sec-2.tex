\section{Perspectives}
In a recent paper, Disarlo, Koberda and Gonz\'{a}lez \cite{disarlo2023model} establish a model theoretic connection between the mapping class groups and the curve graph of non-sporadic finite-type surfaces, which is motivated by Ivanov's metaconjecture \cite{ivanov2006fifteen}. Following their ideas, another way to ask Question \ref{q1} is the following:
\begin{ques}
Given a graph on countable vertices, how can one detect if it is the curve graph of an orientable surface?
\end{ques}

Another notion that is closely related to the extreme amenability is the amenability of a topological group, \emph{i.e.} every continuous group action on a compact Hausdorff space admits an invariant probability measure over the space. Although the non extreme amenability is already clear, it remains unknown if there are amenable big mapping class groups. For every but finitely many finite-type orientable surfaces, the mapping class group is non-amenable because as a discrete group, it contains a non-abelian free subgroup on two generators. If the surface is of infinite type, the amenability of its mapping class group is less clear. For the surfaces $\Sigma$ of infinite type having a non-displaceable subsurface $S$ of finite type, one can construct a \emph{blown-up projection complex} from the curve graphs of the $\MCG(\Sigma)$-orbit of $S$, see for example \cite{horbez_qing_rafi_2022,domat2022big}. Equipped with the combinatorial metric, the blown-up projection complex is a separable geodesic Gromov-hyperbolic space on which the mapping class group $\MCG(\Sigma)$ acts continuously by isometries and the $\MCG(\Sigma)$-action is of general type (or sometimes non-elementary). However, an amenable group can never have a continuous action of general type on a separable geodesic Gromov-hyperbolic space by isometries. This implies that these big mapping class groups are not amenable.
