  abstract = {Despite its great success, machine learning can have its limits when dealing with insufficient training data. A potential solution is the additional integration of prior knowledge into the training process which leads to the notion of informed machine learning. In this paper, we present a structured overview of various approaches in this field. We provide a definition and propose a concept for informed machine learning which illustrates its building blocks and distinguishes it from conventional machine learning. We introduce a taxonomy that serves as a classification framework for informed machine learning approaches. It considers the source of knowledge, its representation, and its integration into the machine learning pipeline. Based on this taxonomy, we survey related research and describe how different knowledge representations such as algebraic equations, logic rules, or simulation results can be used in learning systems. This evaluation of numerous papers on the basis of our taxonomy uncovers key methods in the field of informed machine learning.},

  abstract = {We propose a differential evolution-based algorithm for constrained global optimization. Although differential evolution has been used as the underlying global solver, central to our approach is the penalty function that we introduce. The adaptive nature of the penalty function makes the results of the algorithm mostly insensitive to low values of the penalty parameter. We have also demonstrated both empirically and theoretically that the high value of the penalty parameter is detrimental to convergence, specially for functions with multiple local minimizers. Hence, the penalty function can dispense with the penalty parameter. We have extensively tested our penalty function-based DE algorithm on a set of 24 benchmark test problems. Results obtained are compared with those of some recent algorithms.},

We prove that the general constrained optimization problem is equivalent to a bound constrained problem in the sense that they have the same global solutions. The global minimizer of the penalty function subject to a set of bound constraints may be obtained by a population-based meta-heuristic. Further, a hybrid self-adaptive penalty firefly algorithm, with a local intensification search, is designed, and its convergence analysis is established. The numerical experiments and a comparison with other penalty-based approaches show the effectiveness of the new self-adaptive penalty algorithm in solving constrained global optimization problems.},

Traditional physics-based modeling approaches require domain expertise and are often difficult to tune or adapt to new systems. In this paper, we show how to model discrete ordinary differential equations (ODE) with algebraic nonlinearities as deep neural networks with varying degrees of prior knowledge. We derive the stability guarantees of the network layers based on the implicit constraints imposed on the weight's eigenvalues. Moreover, we show how to use barrier methods to generically handle additional inequality constraints. We demonstrate the prediction accuracy of learned neural ODEs evaluated on open-loop simulations compared to ground truth dynamics with bi-linear terms.},

  abstract = {Chemical kinetics mechanisms are essential for understanding, analyzing, and simulating complex combustion phenomena. In this study, a Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (Neural ODE) framework is employed to optimize kinetics parameters of reaction mechanisms. Given experimental or high-cost simulated observations as training data, the proposed algorithm can optimally recover the hidden characteristics in the data. Different datasets of various sizes, types, and noise levels are tested. A classic toy problem of stiff Robertson ODE is first used to demonstrate the learning capability, efficiency, and robustness of the Neural ODE approach. A 41-species, 232-reactions JP-10 skeletal mechanism and a 34-species, 121-reactions n-heptane skeletal mechanism are then optimized with species' temporal profiles and ignition delay times, respectively. Results show that the proposed algorithm can optimize stiff chemical models with sufficient accuracy and efficiency. It is noted that the trained mechanism not only fits the data perfectly but also retains its physical interpretability, which can be further integrated and validated in practical turbulent combustion simulations.},

  abstract = {The state of health (SOH) of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is a critical parameter of the battery management system. Because of the complex internal electrochemical properties of LIBs and uncertain external working environment, it is difficult to achieve an accurate SOH determination. In this paper, we have proposed a novel SOH estimation method by using a prior knowledge-based neural network (PKNN) and the Markov chain for a single LIB. First, we extract multiple features to capture the battery aging process. Due to its effective fitting ability for complex nonlinear problems, the neural network with a prior knowledge-based optimization strategy is adopted for the battery SOH prediction. The Markov chain, with the advantageous prediction performance for the long-term system, is established to modify the PKNN estimation results based on the prediction error. Experimental results show that the maximum estimation error of the SOH is reduced to less than 1.7\% by adopting the proposed method. By comparing with the group method of data handling and the back-propagation neural network in conjunction with the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm, the proposed estimation method obtains the highest SOH accuracy.},
