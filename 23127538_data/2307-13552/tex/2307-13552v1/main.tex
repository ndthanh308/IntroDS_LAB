%\title{Learning to Play the Rubik's Cube From Image to Solutions with PDDL}

\maketitle
\begin{abstract}


\begin{quote}

Rubik's Cube (RC) is a well-known and computationally challenging puzzle that has motivated AI researchers to explore  efficient alternative representations and problem-solving methods. The ideal situation for planning here is that a problem be solved optimally and efficiently represented in a standard notation using a general-purpose solver and heuristics. The fastest solver today for RC is DeepCubeA with a custom representation, and another approach is with Scorpion planner with State-Action-Space+ (SAS+) representation. In this paper, we present the first RC representation in the popular PDDL language so that the domain becomes more accessible to PDDL planners, competitions, and knowledge engineering tools, and is more human-readable. We then bridge across existing approaches  and compare performance.
We find that in one comparable experiment, DeepCubeA\footnote{DeepCubeA trained with 12 RC actions} solves all problems with varying complexities, albeit only 18\% are optimal plans. For the same problem set, Scorpion with SAS+ representation and pattern database heuristics solves 61.50\% problems, while FastDownward with PDDL representation and FF heuristic solves 56.50\% problems, out of which all the plans generated were optimal. Our study provides valuable insights into the trade-offs between representational choice and plan optimality that can help researchers design future strategies for challenging domains combining general-purpose solving methods (planning, reinforcement learning), heuristics, and representations (standard or custom).

% Solution method - Solver, representation, and Heuristic.

% Rubik's Cube is a well-known and computationally challenging puzzle, which has led researchers in the fields of planning and learning to explore more efficient alternative representations and methods for problem-solving. State-Action-Space+ (SAS+) and Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) are two common representations used in automated planning. \citet{buchner2022comparison} have developed a SAS+ representation for Rubik's Cube and discovered that pattern databases exhibit superior performance. SAS+ employs a state-variable formalism, while PDDL uses a more expressive predicate logic formalism. PDDL provides greater expressivity, standardization, tool support, and is more human-readable compared to SAS+. In this study, we present the first PDDL formulation for the 3x3 Rubik's Cube and conduct a comparative analysis of the two formal languages, along with DeepCubeA \citep{agostinelli2019solving}, a Reinforcement Learning (RL) approach to solving the Rubik's Cube. Our findings indicate that DeepCubeA solves all problems with varying complexities, albeit only 18\% are optimal plans. For the same problem set, SAS+ representation using pattern databases achieves 61.50\% optimal plans, and PDDL representation with the FF heuristic obtains 56.50\% optimal plans. Our study has yielded significant findings regarding the performance of various formal languages and methods used for solving Rubik's Cube problems. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of these different approaches and provide valuable insights into the trade-offs between representational complexity and plan optimality.



% Ultimately, these results can inform the development of more efficient algorithms and representations for solving complex planning problems beyond the Rubik's Cube.


%Rubik's Cube is a popular puzzle that is also computationally hard to solve. As a result,  researchers in both planning and learning - especially reinforcement and deep-learning, communities have attempted to solve its problems by focusing on efficiency but creating alternative representations and methods. Two popular representations for planning problems are State-Action-Space+ (SAS+) and Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL), which are used for modeling and solving problems in the field of automated planning. \citet{buchner2022comparison} have created a SAS+ representation for Rubik's Cube and have found that pattern databases show the best performance in solving Rubik's Cube problems. SAS+ represents planning problems in a state-variable formalism, whereas PDDL is a more expressive language for representing planning problems in a predicate logic formalism. PDDL also offers more expressivity, standardization, tool support, and is human readable as opposed to SAS+. In this paper, we introduce the first PDDL formulation for the 3x3 Rubik's Cube and perform a comparative analysis of the above two formal languages as well as DeepCubeA \cite{agostinelli2019solving}, which is a Reinforcement Learning (RL) based approach for solving the Rubik's Cube. We find that DeepCubeA solves 100\% of the problems with varying complexity, although, a majority of them are non-optimal. For the same problem set, SAS+ representation with pattern databases achieves 61.50\% optimal plans and PDDL representation with FF heuristic \footnote{https://www.fast-downward.org/Doc/Evaluator#FF_heuristic} obtains 56.50\% optimal plans. 


%We then create a common set of benchmark problems and evaluate different planners and heuristics. We find that 

%Consequently, it is hard to draw on their lessons to cross-fertilize new ideas. 

%within a given time and storage budget,  the largest number of problems are solved with the Merge and Shrink abstraction heuristic while when the problem is converted to  SAS+ representation,  pattern database (PDB) heuristics are most effective. 

% --- Abstract 2 
% Rubik's Cube is a popular puzzle that is also computationally hard to solve. In the following work, we introduce the PDDL formulation for the 3-dimensional Rubik's Cube, which is first of it's type to the best of our knowledge. We evaluate the performance of our model with different heuristics which have been employed for solving Rubik's Cube. Additionally, We perform a comparative study of two different representations for Rubik's Cube, namely, PDDL and SAS\textsuperscript{+}. We see that Merge & Shrink abstraction heuristic provides the maximum success rate in case of PDDL model, while the pattern database (PDB) heuristics, the state-of-the-art for solving Rubik’s Cube, were successful with SAS\textsuperscript{+} representation.

% Our system has types of two audiences: (a) planning researchers who can explore a hard problem and improve their planning algorithms, and (b)  RC learners who want to learn how to solve the puzzle at their own pace and can now modify an initial plan (e.g., manually, using other algorithms) and see their execution.

% --- Abstract 1
 %We show how to solve Rubik's Cube with a Planner where the domain and problem are encoded in PDDL. For a planning problem, we just need to provide the criteria on the goal state and describe the problem environment with set of possible actions, and then call the planner on an initial state to find a plan or set of plans to reach the goal state. 
% Further, we show how to capture the initial state as an image and convert it to a problem specification with the aim to solve it.
