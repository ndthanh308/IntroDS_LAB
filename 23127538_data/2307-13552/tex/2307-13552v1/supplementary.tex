        \section{Introduction}
        In the following supplementary material we provide additional plots for comparison of the number of states expanded, runtime and memory usage comparisons plotted against every heuristic we considered in our paper. Also we provide these plots for dataset \textit{d1} and these are consistent with the conclusions mentioned in our paper. We have provided a description of these figures in Table \ref{tab: fig_description}
        \section{Hardware}
        We hve used two servers to run our experiments. One with 48-core nodes each hosting 2 V100 32G GPUs and 128GB of RAM. Another with 256-cores, eight A100 40GB GPUs and 1TB of RAM. The processor speed is 2.8 GHz.
