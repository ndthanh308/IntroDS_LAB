abstract = {We introduce an efficient method for translating planning tasks specified in the standard PDDL formalism into a concise grounded representation that uses finite-domain state variables instead of the straight-forward propositional encoding. Translation is performed in four stages. Firstly, we transform the input task into an equivalent normal form expressed in a restricted fragment of PDDL. Secondly, we synthesize invariants of the planning task that identify groups of mutually exclusive propositions which can be represented by a single finite-domain variable. Thirdly, we perform an efficient relaxed reachability analysis using logic programming techniques to obtain a grounded representation of the input. Finally, we combine the results of the third and fourth stage to generate the final grounded finite-domain representation. The presented approach has originally been implemented as part of the Fast Downward planning system for the 4th International Planning Competition (IPC4). Since then, it has been used in a number of other contexts with considerable success, and the use of concise finite-domain representations has become a common feature of state-of-the-art planners.},

abstract = {A concept of expressive equivalence for planning formalisms based on polynomial transformations is defined. It is argued that this definition is reasonable and useful both from a theoretical and from a practical perspective; if two languages are equivalent, then theoretical results carry over and, more practically, we can model an application problem in one language and then easily use a planner for the other language. In order to cope with the problem of exponentially sized solutions for planning problems an even stronger concept of expressive equivalence is introduced, using the novel ESP reduction. Four different formalisms for propositional planning are then analyzed, namely two variants of STRIPS, ground TWEAK and the SAS+ formalism. Although these may seem to exhibit different degrees of expressive power, it is proven that they are, in fact, expressively equivalent under ESP reduction. This means that neither negative goals, partial initial states nor multi-valued state variables increase the expressiveness of “standard” propositional STRIPS.}

    abstract = "{This paper provides a complete presentation of the syntax, semantics, and some of the properties of ADL, a formalism for representing and reasoning about the effects of actions. ADL is based on the state-transition model of action, combining much of the expressive power of the situation calculus with the notational and computational benefits of the STRIPS language. In combining these elements, ADL attempts to strike a better balance in the tradeoff between the expressiveness of a logical formalism and the computational complexity of reasoning with that formalism. ADL is defined from a semantic standpoint as a set of constraints on the general state-transition model of action. These constraints are general enough to enable situation-dependent effects to be described while being strong enough to provide a simple solution to the frame problem. The syntax of ADL can vary, allowing different syntactical variants to be developed without altering the underlying semantics. The syntax presented here resembles the STRIPS operator language augmented with conditional add and delete lists. Reasoning is accomplished by transforming ADL schemas into regression operators. It is shown that regression operators provide a sound and complete means for reasoning about the effects of actions represented in ADL. It is also shown that, in general, comparable progression operators cannot be constructed from ADL schemas. This result is surprising, since progression operators are conceptually the inverse of regression operators. Reasoning can also be accomplished by axiomatizing ADL schemas in the situation calculus. It is shown that a restricted form of the situation calculus can be defined that is effectively equivalent to ADL in that ADL schemas can be translated into equivalent sets of axioms in this restricted form, and vice versa. The restricted form is interesting in its own right, since it incorporates a solution to the frame problem that does not explicitly rely on circumscription. This solution is derived from the semantics of ADL.}",

    abstract = {Fast Downward is a classical planning system based on heuristic search. It can deal with general deterministic planning problems encoded in the propositional fragment of PDDL2.2, including advanced features like ADL conditions and effects and derived predicates (axioms). Like other well-known planners such as HSP and FF, Fast Downward is a progression planner, searching the space of world states of a planning task in the forward direction. However, unlike other PDDL planning systems, Fast Downward does not use the propositional PDDL representation of a planning task directly. Instead, the input is first translated into an alternative representation called multivalued planning tasks, which makes many of the implicit constraints of a propositional planning task explicit. Exploiting this alternative representation, Fast Downward uses hierarchical decompositions of planning tasks for computing its heuristic function, called the causal graph heuristic, which is very different from traditional HSP-like heuristics based on ignoring negative interactions of operators.In this article, we give a full account of Fast Downward's approach to solving multivalued planning tasks. We extend our earlier discussion of the causal graph heuristic to tasks involving axioms and conditional effects and present some novel techniques for search control that are used within Fast Downward's best-first search algorithm: preferred operators transfer the idea of helpful actions from local search to global best-first search, deferred evaluation of heuristic functions mitigates the negative effect of large branching factors on search performance, and multiheuristic best-first search combines several heuristic evaluation functions within a single search algorithm in an orthogonal way. We also describe efficient data structures for fast state expansion (successor generators and axiom evaluators) and present a new non-heuristic search algorithm called focused iterative-broadening search, which utilizes the information encoded in causal graphs in a novel way.Fast Downward has proven remarkably successful: It won the "classical" (i. e., propositional, non-optimising) track of the 4th International Planning Competition at ICAPS 2004, following in the footsteps of planners such as FF and LPG. Our experiments show that it also performs very well on the benchmarks of the earlier planning competitions and provide some insights about the usefulness of the new search enhancements.},
