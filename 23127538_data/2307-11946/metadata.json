  "abstract": "Let $G$ and $H$ be two vertex disjoint graphs. The {\\em union} $G\\cup H$ is the graph with $V(G\\cup H)=V(G)\\cup (H)$ and $E(G\\cup H)=E(G)\\cup E(H)$. The {\\em join} $G+H$ is the graph with $V(G+H)=V(G)+V(H)$ and $E(G+H)=E(G)\\cup E(H)\\cup\\{xy\\;|\\; x\\in V(G), y\\in V(H)$$\\}$. We use $P_k$ to denote a {\\em path} on $k$ vertices, use {\\em fork} to denote the graph obtained from $K_{1,3}$ by subdividing an edge once, and use {\\em crown} to denote the graph $K_1+K_{1,3}$. In this paper, we show that (\\romannumeral 1) $χ(G)\\le\\frac{3}{2}(ω^2(G)-ω(G))$ if $G$ is (crown, $P_5$)-free, (\\romannumeral 2) $χ(G)\\le\\frac{1}{2}(ω^2(G)+ω(G))$ if $G$ is (crown, fork)-free, and (\\romannumeral 3) $χ(G)\\le\\frac{1}{2}ω^2(G)+\\frac{3}{2}ω(G)+1$ if $G$ is (crown, $P_3\\cup P_2$)-free.",
