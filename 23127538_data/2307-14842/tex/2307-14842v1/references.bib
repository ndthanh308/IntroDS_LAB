abstract = {We perform a realistic estimate of the emission of TeV-PeV gamma rays and neutrinos by galactic matter irradiated by cosmic rays. Our calculation is directly based on profiles of matter in the galactic disk compiled by Bloemen. Our results can be compared with recent experimental limits. We investigate the consequences of hints associated with COS-B data, that cosmic ray spectrum is harder in the outer Galaxy and find that present air shower data rule out a straigtforward extrapolation of a hard spectrum up to 100 TeV. We show that we need neutrino telescopes of order 1 km2 area to map the galaxy in TeV neutrinos.}

abstract = {A supermassive black hole, obscured by cosmic dust, powers the nearby active galaxy NGC 1068. Neutrinos, which rarely interact with matter, could provide information on the galaxy’s active core. We searched for neutrino emission from astrophysical objects using data recorded with the IceCube neutrino detector between 2011 and 2020. The positions of 110 known gamma-ray sources were individually searched for neutrino detections above atmospheric and cosmic backgrounds. We found that NGC 1068 has an excess of 79−20+22 neutrinos at tera–electron volt energies, with a global significance of 4.2σ, which we interpret as associated with the active galaxy. The flux of high-energy neutrinos that we measured from NGC 1068 is more than an order of magnitude higher than the upper limit on emissions of tera–electron volt gamma rays from this source. Observations have shown a diffuse background of high-energy neutrinos, which is known to be of extragalactic origin. However, it has been difficult to identify individual sources that contribute to this background. The IceCube Collaboration reanalyzed the arrival directions of astrophysical neutrinos and then searched for point sources (see the Perspective by Murase). They identified evidence for neutrino emission from NGC 1068 (also known as Messier 77), a nearby active galaxy. Its properties are quite different from TXS 0506+056, which was found to be a neutrino source in 2018, leading the investigators to suggest that there might be more than one population contributing to the neutrino background. —KTS The arrival directions of astrophysical neutrinos indicate point source neutrino emission from NGC 1068.}}

abstract = {Neutrinos interact only very weakly with matter, but giant detectors have succeeded in detecting small numbers of astrophysical neutrinos. Aside from a diffuse background, only two individual sources have been identified: the Sun and a nearby supernova in 1987. A multiteam collaboration detected a high-energy neutrino event whose arrival direction was consistent with a known blazar—a type of quasar with a relativistic jet oriented directly along our line of sight. The blazar, TXS 0506+056, was found to be undergoing a gamma-ray flare, prompting an extensive multiwavelength campaign. Motivated by this discovery, the IceCube collaboration examined lower-energy neutrinos detected over the previous several years, finding an excess emission at the location of the blazar. Thus, blazars are a source of astrophysical neutrinos. Science, this issue p. 147, p. eaat1378 A blazar has been found to be a point source of astrophysical neutrinos, emitted over several years. A high-energy neutrino event detected by IceCube on 22 September 2017 was coincident in direction and time with a gamma-ray flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056. Prompted by this association, we investigated 9.5 years of IceCube neutrino observations to search for excess emission at the position of the blazar. We found an excess of high-energy neutrino events, with respect to atmospheric backgrounds, at that position between September 2014 and March 2015. Allowing for time-variable flux, this constitutes 3.5σ evidence for neutrino emission from the direction of TXS 0506+056, independent of and prior to the 2017 flaring episode. This suggests that blazars are identifiable sources of the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux.}}

abstract = {Neutrinos are thought to be produced in astrophysical sources outside our solar system but, up until recently, they had only been observed from one supernova in 1987. Aartsen et al. (10.1126/science.1242856; see the cover) report data obtained between 2010 and 2012 with the IceCube neutrino detector that reveal the presence of a high-energy neutrino flux containing the most energetic neutrinos ever observed, including 28 events at energies between 30 and 1200 TeV. Although the origin of this flux is unknown, the findings are consistent with expectations for a neutrino population with origins outside the solar system. The IceCube observatory at the South Pole detected neutrinos from outside our solar system. We report on results of an all-sky search for high-energy neutrino events interacting within the IceCube neutrino detector conducted between May 2010 and May 2012. The search follows up on the previous detection of two PeV neutrino events, with improved sensitivity and extended energy coverage down to about 30 TeV. Twenty-six additional events were observed, substantially more than expected from atmospheric backgrounds. Combined, both searches reject a purely atmospheric origin for the 28 events at the 4σ level. These 28 events, which include the highest energy neutrinos ever observed, have flavors, directions, and energies inconsistent with those expected from the atmospheric muon and neutrino backgrounds. These properties are, however, consistent with generic predictions for an additional component of extraterrestrial origin.}}
