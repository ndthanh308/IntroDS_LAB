  "abstract": "We calculate the two-point massless QCD correlator of nonlocal (composite) vector quark currents with chains of fermion one-loop radiative corrections inserted into gluon lines. The correlator depends on the Bjorken fraction $x$ related to the composite current and, under large-$β_0$ approximation, gives the main contributions in each order of perturbation theory. In the mentioned approximation, these contributions dominate the endpoint behavior of the leading-twist distribution amplitudes of light mesons in the framework of QCD sum rules. Based on this, we analyze the endpoint behavior of these distribution amplitudes for $π$ and longitudinally polarized $ρ^\\|$ mesons and find inequalities for their moments.",
