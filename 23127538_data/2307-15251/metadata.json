  "abstract": "Convolutional neural networks (CNN) and Transformer have wildly succeeded in multimedia applications. However, more effort needs to be made to harmonize these two architectures effectively to satisfy speech enhancement. This paper aims to unify these two architectures and presents a Parallel Conformer for speech enhancement. In particular, the CNN and the self-attention (SA) in the Transformer are fully exploited for local format patterns and global structure representations. Based on the small receptive field size of CNN and the high computational complexity of SA, we specially designed a multi-branch dilated convolution (MBDC) and a self-channel-time-frequency attention (Self-CTFA) module. MBDC contains three convolutional layers with different dilation rates for the feature from local to non-local processing. Experimental results show that our method performs better than state-of-the-art methods in most evaluation criteria while maintaining the lowest model parameters.",
