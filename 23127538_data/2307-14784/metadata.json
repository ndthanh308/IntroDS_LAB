  "abstract": "Microwave power absorption by a two-layer system deposited on a metallic surface has been studied in the experimental setup emulating the response to a radar signal. Layers containing hexaferrite and iron powder in a dried paint of thickness under 1mm have been used. The data is analyzed within a theoretical model derived for a bilayer system from the transmission line theory. A good agreement between experimental and theoretical results is found. The advantage of using a bilayer system over a single-layer system has been demonstrated. How the maximum microwave absorption (minimum reflection loss) can be achieved through the optimization of the filling factors and thicknesses of the two layers is shown.",
