abstract = {Persistent homology, while ostensibly measuring changes in topology, captures multiscale geometrical information. It is a natural tool for the analysis of point patterns. In this paper we explore the statistical power of the persistent homology rank functions. For a point pattern X we construct a filtration of spaces by taking the union of balls of radius a centred on points in X, Xa=∪x∈XB(x,a). The rank function βk(X):{(a,b)∈R2:a≤b}→R is then defined by βk(X)(a,b)=rank(ι∗:Hk(Xa)→Hk(Xb)) where ι∗ is the induced map on homology from the inclusion map on spaces. We consider the rank functions as lying in a Hilbert space and show that under reasonable conditions the rank functions from multiple simulations or experiments will lie in an affine subspace. This enables us to perform functional principal component analysis which we apply to experimental data from colloids at different effective temperatures and to sphere packings with different volume fractions. We also investigate the potential of rank functions in providing a test of complete spatial randomness of 2D point patterns using the distances to an empirically computed mean rank function of binomial point patterns in the unit square.}

Since this summary lies in a vector space, it is easy to combine with tools from statistics and machine learning, in contrast to the standard topological summaries. Viewed as a random variable with values in a Banach space, this summary obeys a strong law of large numbers and a central limit theorem. We show how a number of standard statistical tests can be used for statistical inference using this summary. We also prove that this summary is stable and that it can be used to provide lower bounds for the bottleneck and Wasserstein distances.},

abstract = {Since at least half of the d edges incident to a vertex v of a simple d-polytope P either all point “up” or all point “down,” v must be the unique “bottom” or “top” vertex of a face of P of dimension at least d2. Thus the number of P's vertices is at most twice the number of such high-dimensional faces, which is at most ∑d/2 ≤ i ≤ d(nd−v) = 0(n⌊d/2⌋), if P has n facets. This, in a nutshell, provides a proof of the asymptotic version of the famous upper bound theorem: A convex d-polytope with n facets (or, dually, with n vertices) has O(n[d2]) faces, when d is constant.}
