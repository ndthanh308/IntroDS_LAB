abstract="The interior media of stars and planets are often virtually perfect conductors and possess magnetic fields. These fields are said to be ``frozen`` into the medium (for instance, plasma or magma) in spite of temperatures of a million degrees. Mathematically this means that any motion of the medium transports the fields by a diffeomorphism action preserving the mutual alocation of the fields' trajectories. Such a transform may diminish the field magnetic energy. The topological structure of the field provides obstacles to the full dissipation of the magnetic energy of the star or planet.",

The application to thermonuclear devices has already been made the subject of a report by A. A. Ware and is only briefly sketched here. The stress in the present report is on the theoretical aspects.

The discussion of liquid flow is somewhat compressed. It includes, in addition to problems of flow through ducts and around bodies, the theory of various kinds of instability, due to velocity shears, temperature gradients or magnetic stresses. Many examples of the last type of instability also occur in ionized gases.

The discussion of phenomena in ionized gases is preceded by an account of the factors determining electric currents, particularly in a gas at low density. The topics treated include hydromagnetic waves of small and finite amplitudes, the control of thermonuclear devices, and the generation of electricity from fast-moving plasmas.

The final section is concerned with geophysical phenomena arising from the emission by the sun of streams of charged particles. The discussion does not extend down to the ionosphere, in which processes are not genuinely hydromagnetic. It is concerned with the generation of solar streams, with their effects in interplanetary space, and with their interaction with the distant geomagnetic field during magnetic storms.}

The three-dimensional divergence-free eigensolutions of this problem are examples of the so-called Beltrami fields or linear force-free fields, which arise in various physics areas such as solar physics, plasma physics, and fluid mechanics. The present analysis is restricted to bounded simply-connected domains. Finite element discretizations of two weak formulations of the spectral problem are proposed and analyzed. Optimal-order spectral convergence is proved, as well as absence of spurious modes. The results of some numerical tests are also reported.},

abstract = {In this Letter we extend the proof, by Faraco and Lindberg (2020), of Taylor’s conjecture in multiply connected domains to cover arbitrary vector potentials and remove the need to impose restrictions on the magnetic field to ensure gauge invariance of the helicity integral. This extension allows us to treat general magnetic fields in closed domains that are important in laboratory plasmas and brings closure to a conjecture whose resolution has been open for almost 50 years.}
