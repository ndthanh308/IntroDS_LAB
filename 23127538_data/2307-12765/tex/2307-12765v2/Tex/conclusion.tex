\section{conclusion}
In this paper, a set of well-known HGNN models are quantitatively characterized on GPU to disclose the execution patterns, performance bottlenecks, and acceleration opportunities of HGNNs.
Then, a high-performance HGNN accelerator, HiHGNN, is designed to exploit the high-degree parallelism and data reusability in HGNNs. HiHGNN achieves higher performance and energy efficiency compared with the high-end GPU A100. We believe that our findings and design will attract more scholars to participate in designing the architecture for increasingly important HGNNs.
