  "abstract": "In this study, analytical models for space charge limited current (SCLC) transport in a porous (or disordered) trap-limited dielectric are derived for both planar and cylindrical configuration. By considering the porous solid as a fractional object characterized by a parameter a less than 1, we formulate its fractional capacitance and determine the SCLC transport by using the transit time approach. At a equal to 1, it will recover the well-known Mott Gurney (MG) law and Mark Helfrich (MH) law for trap-free and trap-limited cases, respectively. For cylindrical geometry, our findings show an analytical form that is not available from the traditional methods. We anticipate the proposed analytical model will serve as a useful tool for characterizing the current-voltage measurements in SCLC transport in dielectric breakdown and organic electronics, where spatial porosity of the materials is inevitable. The introduced fractional parameter a extracted from such characterization can facilitate the quantitative determination of the relationship between spatial porosity and charge mobility.",
