\begin{abstract}
% \philipp{Explainability techniques are rapidly being developed to improve human-AI decision-making across various collaborative work settings, such as radiology and wildlife conservation. Consequently, previous research has evaluated how these techniques in various domains impact humans' decision-making behavior, such as their reliance on AI, with the aim of designing more human-centered computer-supported collaborative tools. Moreover, not only is AI susceptible to incorrect AI advice, but there is also the potential for these explanations to be incorrect. Thus, it is crucial to understand how these imperfect explanations affect human AI decision-making. In this work, we contribute a robust, mixed-methods user study with 136 participants to evaluate how imperfect explanations influence humans' decision-making behavior in a bird classification task taking into account their level of expertise and an explanation's level of assertiveness. Our findings reveal the impact of imperfect explanations and humans' level of expertise on their reliance on AI. Hence, we shed light on this emerging field of computer-supported collaborative work and provide guidelines for designers of human-AI collaboration systems.}

Explainability techniques are rapidly being developed to improve human-AI decision-making across various cooperative work settings. Consequently, previous research has evaluated how decision-makers collaborate with imperfect AI by investigating appropriate reliance and task performance with the aim of designing more human-centered computer-supported collaborative tools. Several human-centered explainable AI (XAI) techniques have been proposed in hopes of improving decision-makers' collaboration with AI; however, these techniques are grounded in findings from previous studies that primarily focus on the impact of incorrect AI advice. Few studies acknowledge the possibility of the explanations being incorrect even if the AI advice is correct. Thus, it is crucial to understand how imperfect XAI affects human-AI decision-making. In this work, we contribute a robust, mixed-methods user study with 136 participants to evaluate how incorrect explanations influence humans' decision-making behavior in a bird species identification task, taking into account their level of expertise and an explanation's level of assertiveness. Our findings reveal the influence of imperfect XAI and humans' level of expertise on their reliance on AI and human-AI team performance. We also discuss how explanations can deceive decision-makers during human-AI collaboration. Hence, we shed light on the impacts of imperfect XAI in the field of computer-supported cooperative work and provide guidelines for designers of human-AI collaboration systems.

%   \caption{Ornithologists and citizen scientists collaborate with the same imperfect artificial intelligence (AI) systems. However, citizen scientists have a different level of expertise than ornithologists, which could cause them to under-rely on the AI advice, such as in this case with the Canada Warbler. In this example, the example-based explanation, which was generated based on a content-based image retrieval technique, shows a different bird species than the Canada Warbler. This incorrect explanation can cause non-experts, such as citizen scientists, to under rely on AI even when the prediction is correct. Experts may be more confident with their own knowledge, thus correctly classifying the bird despite the incorrect explanation.
