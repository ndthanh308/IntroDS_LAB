  "abstract": "Exploiting a mapping between transport theory and fluid dynamics, we show how a fluid-dynamic description of the diffusion of charm quarks in the QCD plasma is feasible. We show results for spectra of charmed hadrons obtained with a fluid-dynamic description of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) coupled with the conservation of a heavy-quark - antiquark current. We compare our calculations with the most recent experimental data in order to provide further constraints on the transport coefficients of the QGP.",
