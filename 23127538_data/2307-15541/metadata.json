  "abstract": "We conducted an investigation into Affleck-Dine baryogenesis within the context of D-term inflation, specifically focusing on its relationship with a recent reheating formalism. It was found that by considering a specific reheating temperature, the observed baryon asymmetry can be accounted through Affleck-Dine baryogenesis. Additionally, the majority of gravitinos are inferred to be generated from the decay of the next-to-lightest supersymmetric particle, with Q-balls potentially serving as a source of gravitinos via NSP decay. The temperature at which decay occurs depends on the charge of the Q-balls, which is determined by the fragmentation of the Affleck-Dine condensate. Remarkably, the gravitino mass required for dark matter aligns naturally with the theoretical gravitino mass.",
