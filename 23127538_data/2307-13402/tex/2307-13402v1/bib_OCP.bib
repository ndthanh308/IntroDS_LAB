As applications, we give detailed proofs of very general necessary conditions for various types of extremal problems, such as the problems of mathematical programming, of optimal control (in particular, we include a proof of Pontryagin's maximum principle), and of minimax problems.},

For its numerical integration, symplectic methods are a natural choice. This article investigates to which extent the excellent performance of symplectic integrators for long-time integrations in astronomy and molecular dynamics carries over to problems in optimal control. Numerical experiments supported by a backward error analysis show that for problems in low dimension close to a critical value of the Hamiltonian, symplectic integrators have a clear advantage. This is illustrated using the Martinet case in sub-Riemannian geometry. For problems like the orbital transfer of a spacecraft or the control of a submerged rigid body, such an advantage cannot be observed. The Hamiltonian system is a boundary value problem and the time interval is in general not large enough so that symplectic integrators could benefit from their structure preservation of the flow.

However, it is natural to want to use the discrete NLP multipliers to estimate the adjoint variables. It has been shown earlier in the literature for a large collection of numerical discretizations that order of the state and control variables found are generally independent of the implementation of the chosen discretization if no post processing is used to find the control. This is not always true for the adjoint estimation problem. The compressed trapezoidal discretization is used in some commercial codes. In this paper we show that the second order adjoint estimate result for the uncompressed trapezoidal method does not hold for the compressed trapezoidal method. We also show how to recover the lost order and carefully analyze convergence. Some related results are also discussed.},

  abstract = {In this article we derive a Pontryagin maximum principle (PMP) for discrete-time optimal control problems on matrix Lie groups. The PMP provides first order necessary conditions for optimality; these necessary conditions typically yield two point boundary value problems, and these boundary value problems can then be solved to extract optimal control trajectories. Constrained optimal control problems for mechanical systems, in general, can only be solved numerically, and this motivates the need to derive discrete-time models that are accurate and preserve the non-flat manifold structures of the underlying continuous-time controlled systems. The PMPs for discrete-time systems evolving on Euclidean spaces are not readily applicable to discrete-time models evolving on non-flat manifolds. In this article we bridge this gap and establish a discrete-time PMP on matrix Lie groups. Our discrete-time models are derived via discrete mechanics, (a structure preserving discretization scheme) leading to the preservation of the underlying manifold under the dynamics, thereby resulting in greater numerical accuracy of our technique. This PMP caters to a class of constrained optimal control problems that includes point-wise state and control action constraints, and encompasses a large class of control problems that arise in various field of engineering and the applied sciences.},

In this part, we develop the variational structure of implicit Lagrangian systems. Specifically, we show that the implicit Euler\textendash Lagrange equations can be formulated using an extended variational principle of Hamilton called the Hamilton\textendash Pontryagin principle. This variational formulation incorporates, in a natural way, the generalized Legendre transformation, which enables one to treat degenerate Lagrangian systems. The definition of this generalized Legendre transformation makes use of natural maps between iterated tangent and cotangent spaces. Then, we develop an extension of the classical Lagrange\textendash d'Alembert principle called the Lagrange\textendash d'Alembert\textendash Pontryagin principle for implicit Lagrangian systems with constraints and external forces. A particularly interesting case is that of nonholonomic mechanical systems that can have both constraints and external forces. In addition, we define a constrained Dirac structure on the constraint momentum space, namely the image of the Legendre transformation (which, in the degenerate case, need not equal the whole cotangent bundle). We construct an implicit constrained Lagrangian system associated with this constrained Dirac structure by making use of an Ehresmann connection. Two examples, namely a vertical rolling disk on a plane and an L\textendash C circuit are given to illustrate the results.},
