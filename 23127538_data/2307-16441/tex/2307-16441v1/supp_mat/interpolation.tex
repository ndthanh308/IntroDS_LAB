    \captionof{figure}{Latent code $z$ interpolation results. For each image, we sample two latent codes  $z_{\mathrm{start}}, z_{\mathrm{end}} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ and linearly interpolate, obtaining $z_i = (1 - \alpha) \cdot z_{\mathrm{start}} + \alpha \cdot z_{\mathrm{end}}$. The strokes smoothly transition changing position but focusing on the same object.}
