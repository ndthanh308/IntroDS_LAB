    \captionof{figure}{Next predicted stroke probability distribution. For each method, we show the probability that a given pixel will be occupied by a predicted stroke for the given context. The context (outlined in blue in the first column) is kept fixed and we sample $n=500$ continuations for each method to estimate the probability distribution.}
