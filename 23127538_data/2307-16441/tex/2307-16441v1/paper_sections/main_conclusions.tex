\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec_conclusion}

In this paper we introduce the novel task of interactive neural painting, where a user tries to reproduce a scene on a painting and the objective is to give (multiple) suggestions about the next strokes to paint, thus helping the user in producing its artwork. The proposed method is based on a conditional transformer VAE architecture, which is demonstrated on two novel datasets. Our experiments show that our model: correctly paints the reference image, outputs strokes whose characteristics are close to demonstration data, gives diverse yet plausible brush-stroke suggestions; and outperforms the analyzed baselines on a large set of metrics and on a user study. We hope that our work can stimulate further research in this domain.
