  "abstract": "The large time $t$ asymptotics for scalar, constant coefficient,linear, third order, dispersive equations are obtained for asymptotically time-periodic Dirichlet boundary data and zero initial data on the half-line modeling a wavemaker acting upon an initially quiescent medium. The asymptotic Dirichlet-to-Neumann (D-N) map is constructed by expanding upon the recently developed $Q$-equation method. The D-N map is proven to be unique if and only if the radiation condition that selects the unique wavenumber branch of the dispersion relation for a sinusoidal, time-dependent boundary condition holds: (i) for frequencies in a finite interval, the wavenumber is real and corresponds to positive group velocity, (ii) for frequencies outside the interval, the wavenumber is complex with positive imaginary part. For fixed spatial location $x$, the corresponding asymptotic solution is (i) a traveling wave or (ii) a spatially decaying, time-periodic wave. Uniform-in-$x$ asymptotic solutions for the physical cases of the linearized Korteweg-de Vries and Benjamin-Bona-Mahony (BBM) equations are obtained via integral asymptotics. The linearized BBM asymptotics are found to quantitatively agree with viscous core-annular fluid experiments.",
