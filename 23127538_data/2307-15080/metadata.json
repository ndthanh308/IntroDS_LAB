  "abstract": "In this paper, the major upgrades and technical improvements of the buffer gas handling system for the cryogenic stopping cell of the FRS Ion Catcher at GSI/FAIR (in Darmstadt, Germany) are described. The upgrades include implementation of new gas lines and gas purifiers to achieve a higher buffer gas cleanliness for a more efficient extraction of reactive ions as well as suppression of the molecular background ionized in the stopping cell. Furthermore, additional techniques have been implemented for improved monitoring and quantification of the purity of the helium buffer gas.",
