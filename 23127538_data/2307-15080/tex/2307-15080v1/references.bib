  abstract = {ISOLDE, the Isotope Separation On-Line facility, at CERN is a leading facility for the production of beams of exotic radioactive isotopes. Currently over 1000 different isotopes with half lives down to milliseconds can be extracted with beam intensities of up to 10{\^{ }}11 ions per second. However, due to the reactive target environment not all isotopes are extractable in sufficient amounts.
In this work the extraction of short lived carbon and boron isotopes is investigated. Therefore a variety of experimental and computanional techniques have been used.},

  abstract = {In order to formulate a statistical model of nuclear properties we combine the Thomas-Fermi assumption of two fermions per h3 of phase space with an effective interaction between nucleons that contains seven adjustable parameters. After allowing for shell effects, an even-odd correction and a congruence energy (“Wigner Term”), six of the seven parameters were fitted to 1654 ground state masses of nuclei with N, Z ⩾ 8, together with a constraint that ensures agreement with measured values of the nuclear surface diffuseness. The RMS deviation in the fit to masses was 0.655 MeV, and the calculated values exhibit no drastic discrepancies even for A = 3. Calculated sizes of nuclear charge distributions agree closely with measurements. Calculated fission barriers were compared with 40 measured values down to 75Br. For Z ⩾ 88 the agreement is almost perfect. For Z < 88 the trend of the measurements seems to confirm the expectation that the congruence energy should double its magnitude for strongly necked-in saddle-point shapes. A seventh (density-dependence) parameter in the effective interaction can be adjusted to ensure fair agreement with the measured energy-dependence of the optical model potential in the range from −70 MeV to 180 MeV. The model is used to predict properties of nuclear and neutron matter (including their compressibilities). A table of some 9000 calculated ground state masses of nuclei up to Z = 135 has been prepared.},

The inhomogeneous source terms contain shell-dependent symmetry energy expressions (quadratic in isospin), and include, as well, an independently derived shell-model Coulomb energy equation which describes all known Coulomb displacement energies with a standard deviation of σc = 41 keV. Perturbations of higher order in isospin, previously recognized as a cause of systematic effects in long-range mass extrapolations, are also incorporated. The most general solutions of the inhomogeneous difference equation have been deduced from a χ2-minimization procedure based on the recent atomic mass adjustment of Wapstra, Audi, and Hoekstra. Subjecting the solutions further to the condition of charge symmetry preserves the accuracy of Coulomb energies and allows mass predictions for nuclei with both N ⩾ Z and Z > N. The solutions correspond to a mass equation with 470 parameters. Using this equation, 4385 mass values have been calculated for nuclei with A ⩾ 16 (except N = Z = odd for A < 40), with a standard deviation of σm = 194 keV from the experimental masses.},

Six coefficients in the polynomial in the gross part are fixed somewhat arbitrarily in order to avoid their drift to unreasonable values in the optimization procedure, while the remaining six coefficients, treated as adjustable parameters, and 269 shell parameters are determined from simultaneous considerations of fit to experimental data, charge symmetry, and reasonableness of the behavior of the shell parameters as functions of Z and N.

A judicious division of the input data into subsets of neutron-rich and proton-rich nuclei had to be introduced to reduce systematic errors in long-range extrapolations. Approximately 5600 mass-excess values for nuclei with 2 ⩽ Z ⩽ 103, 4 ⩽ N ⩽ 157, and N ⩾ Z (except N = Z = odd for A < 40) have been calculated. The standard deviation for reproducing the known mass-excess values is σm ≈ 103 keV.

It also reflects the outcome of an earlier town meeting of the nuclear astrophysics community organized by the Joint Institute for Nuclear Astrophysics (JINA) on October 9–10, 2012 Detroit, Michigan, with the purpose of developing a vision for nuclear astrophysics in light of the recent NRC decadal surveys in nuclear physics (NP2010) and astronomy (ASTRO2010). The white paper is furthermore informed by the town meeting of the Association of Research at University Nuclear Accelerators (ARUNA) that took place at the University of Notre Dame on June 12–13, 2014. In summary we find that nuclear astrophysics is a modern and vibrant field addressing fundamental science questions at the intersection of nuclear physics and astrophysics. These questions relate to the origin of the elements, the nuclear engines that drive life and death of stars, and the properties of dense matter. A broad range of nuclear accelerator facilities, astronomical observatories, theory efforts, and computational capabilities are needed.

The large acceptances allow one to produce RI beams efficiently by using in-flight fission of uranium ions, being achieved by using superconducting quadrupoles with a large aperture. The tandem separator scheme allows one to deliver tagged RI beam.

The overall efficiency is hence limited mostly by the stopping efficiency, which could be increased in the future by operating at higher gas cell pressures. From extraction time measurements of polyatomic ions formed in the gas cell extraction times of atomic ions of 20–50ms can be derived.

  abstract = {The GSI projectile fragment separator FRS has demonstrated with many pioneering experiments the research potential of in-flight separators at relativistic energies. Although the present facility has contributed much to the progress in the field of nuclear structure physics, major improvements are desirable in the future. The characteristics of the proposed next-generation facility at GSI, the Super-FRS, will be presented and compared to other projects. The Super-FRS is a large-acceptance superconducting fragment separator followed by different experimental branches including a combination with a new storage-cooler ring system. This system consists of a collector ring (CR) and a new experimental storage ring (NESR) which allow precision mass and lifetime measurements as well as in-ring reaction studies. The NESR can be operated in combination with an electron ring to measure electron scattering with exotic nuclei. This electron heavy-ion collider will open up new fields for nuclear structure research.},

  abstract  = {The in-flight or direct production of secondary beams of radioactive ions is discussed. Two reaction mechanisms, fragmentation and fission of fast projectiles, have been shown to be very effective at producing beams of an extremely broad range of interesting nuclei. The resulting nuclei have large forward momenta with relatively sharp angular distributions peaked close to zero degrees. Such narrow distributions are readily collected and purified with magnetic devices by exploiting atomic energy-loss processes in profiled energy degraders. With large aperture magnets and high energy primary beams, collection of nearly the full momentum and angular distribution of a given fragment are now possible, although the beam emittance may be poor and depends on the production mechanism. The features of the production reaction mechanisms, separation techniques, and a survey of the present and proposed devices are presented.},

  abstract = {This contribution discusses the characteristics of different types of nuclear reactions and the influence of the beam energy in view of future prospects for secondary-beam production. First, electronic interactions in the target are considered because they define the usable target thickness. Rather high beam energies are advantageous. Secondly, the nuclear-reaction aspects are discussed. Three reaction mechanisms provide the most promising prospects for the production of secondary beams. Fusion is best suited for the production of nuclei near the proton drip line and for the heaviest elements. Fission specifically populates mid-mass neutron-rich isotopes. Fragmentation and spallation reactions represent rather universal production mechanisms for both neutron-deficient and neutron-rich exotic nuclei, since the fluctuations in the N-over-Z ratio are very important. Due to these large fluctuations, this is the most promising reaction mechanism to reach extremely exotic nuclei over the whole mass range, if sufficiently high primary-beam intensities are available. In particular, it seems to be a unique process for the production of extremely neutron-rich isotopes of elements above the region of fission fragments. These considerations are verified with experimental data. In particular, a systematic overview on the production of residual nuclei in reactions at relativistic energies has been obtained in several experiments recently performed at GSI in inverse kinematics. They allow to give a rather realistic estimate on the prospects for secondary-beam production in next-generation facilities.},

  abstract = {The production rates of neutron-rich fission products for the next-generation radioactive beam facility EURISOL [EU-RTD Project EURISOL (HPRI-CT-1999-50001)] are mainly limited by the maximum amount of power deposited by protons in the target. An alternative approach is to use neutron beams to induce fission in actinide targets. This has the advantage of reducing: the energy deposited by the proton beam in the target; contamination from neutron-deficient isobars that would be produced by spallation; and mechanical stress on the target. At ISOLDE CERN [E. Kugler, Hyperfine Interact. 129 (2000) 23], tests have been made on standard ISOLDE actinide targets using fast-neutron bunches produced by bombarding thick, high-Z metal converters with 1 and 1.4 GeV proton pulses. This paper reviews the first applications of converters used at ISOLDE. It highlights the different geometries and the techniques used to compare fission yields produced by the proton beam directly on the target with neutron-induced fission. Results from the six targets already tested, namely UC2/graphite and ThO2 targets with tungsten and tantalum converters, are presented. To gain further knowledge for the design of a dedicated target as required by the TARGISOL project [EU-RTD Project TARGISOL (HPRI-CT-2001-50033)], the results are compared to simulations, using the MARS [N.V.

Additional measurements of the ion's velocity and energy enable the charge state of the recoil to be uniquely defined and thus permit precision mass measurements given sufficient statistics. The performance of the spectrometer has been investigated in both off-line (using alpha sources) and on-line tests. The design resolution of ΔM/M = 12000 (fwhm) has been achieved. Initial performance results of the spectrometer are described with emphasis placed on the techniques used to achieve the overall high mass resolution and large solid angle/momentum acceptance.},

In certain sasfilled photoelectric cells the self maintained discharge starts in absolute darkness only with a time lag, depending on the applied voltage. A very small illumination diminishes this time lag considerably. Below the starting potential a current due to thermionic emission of the cathode is flowing, the characteristic showing peculiar discontinuities. In connection with earlier experiments these phenomena are explained by the influence of the cell window acting as a third electrode with a large coefficient of secondary emission. When due attention is paid to the influence of a preceding discharge, the time lag diminishes as the temperature of the cell is increased.},

J. J. Thomson’s studies of rays of negatively- and positively-charged particles led to his characterization of the former as electrons and the latter as atomic/molecular fragments that he identified via the first mass spectrometer. In the following survey I traced the evolution of mass spectrometry and the role it played in the direct demonstration of the isotopic composition of the elements. While its potential utility as an analytical tool was recognized by J. J. Thomson, its practical application had to await the development of ancillary laboratory techniques. With respect to investigations of isotopes, complementary but distinct routes were followed by physicists and chemists during the two decades after WWI. The last section of this report recounts my personal experiences with mass spectrometry and with several of the principal personae during the years 1930–1935.},

During the on-line measurements the ions with total energies of around 200keV/u were thermalised in helium buffer gas at 40–60mbar. In the following they were guided by a combination of electric RF- and DC-fields until they were transported by the gas flow through the extraction nozzle. After being extracted by a supersonic gas jet the ions were separated from the buffer gas and guided by the extraction RFQ towards subsequent detection systems.

One can see a renaissance in np correlation studies in relation to the significant progress in radioactive ion beam facilities and detection techniques. The np pairs can couple isospin T = 1 (isovector) or 0 (isoscalar). In the isovector channel, the angular momentum zero component is expected to be the most important one. On the other hand, as one may infer from the general properties of the np two-body interaction, in the isoscalar channel, both the np pairs with minimum ( J = 1) and maximum ( J = 2 j ) spin values can be important. In this contribution, we will discuss the possible evidence for np pair coupling from a different perspective and analyze its influence on interesting phenomena including the Wigner effect and mass correlations in odd–odd nuclei. In particular, we will explain the spin-aligned pair coupling scheme and quartet coupling involving pairs with maximum ( J = 2 j ) spin values.},

For example, theoretical models have predicted an “island of stability” in the region of the superheavy elements due to the closure of spherical proton and neutron shells. Depending on the model, these are expected at Z = 114, 120 or even 126 and N = 172 or 184. Valuable information on the road to the island of stability is derived from high-precision mass measurements, which give direct access to binding energies of short-lived trans-uranium nuclei. Recently, direct mass measurements at \{SHIPTRAP\} have been extended to nobelium and lawrencium isotopes around the deformed shell gap N = 152. In order to further extend mass measurements to the region of superheavy elements, new technical developments are required to increase the performance of our setup. The sensitivity will increase through the implementation of a new detection method, where observation of one single ion is sufficient. Together with the use of a more efficient gas stopping cell, this will us allow to significantly enhance the overall efficiency of SHIPTRAP. },

  abstract = {Abstract The study of nuclei farther from the valley of β -stability than ever before goes hand-in-hand with shorter-lived nuclei produced in smaller abundances than their less exotic counterparts. The measurement, to high precision, of nuclear masses therefore requires innovations in technique in order to keep up. TRIUMF’s Ion Trap for Atomic and Nuclear science (TITAN) facility deploys three ion traps, with a fourth in the commissioning phase, to perform and support Penning trap mass spectrometry and in-trap decay spectroscopy on some of the shortest-lived nuclei ever studied. We report on recent advances and updates to the \{TITAN\} facility since the 2012 \{EMIS\} conference. TITAN’s charge breeding capabilities have been improved and in-trap decay spectroscopy can be performed in TITAN’s Electron Beam Ion Trap (EBIT). Higher charge states can improve the precision of mass measurements, reduce the beam-time requirements for a given measurement, improve beam purity, and open the door to access isotopes not available from the \{ISOL\} method via in-trap decay and recapture. This was recently demonstrated during TITAN’s mass measurement of 30 Al. The EBIT’s decay spectroscopy setup was commissioned with a successful branching ratio and half-life measurement of 124 Cs. Charge breeding in the \{EBIT\} increases the energy spread of the ion bunch sent to the Penning trap for mass measurement, so a new Cooler \{PEnning\} Trap (CPET), which aims to cool highly charged ions with an electron plasma, is undergoing offline commissioning. Already \{CPET\} has demonstrated the trapping and self-cooling of a room-temperature electron plasma that was stored for several minutes. A new detector has been installed inside the \{CPET\} magnetic field which will allow for in-magnet charged particle detection. },

All nuclides for which any experimental information is known were considered. NUBASE2016 covers all data published by October 2016 in primary (journal articles) and secondary (mainly laboratory reports and conference proceedings) references, together with the corresponding bibliographical information. During the development of NUBASE2016, the data available in the ‘Evaluated Nuclear Structure Data File’ (ENSDF) database were consulted and critically assessed for their validity and completeness. Furthermore, a large amount of new data and some older experimental results that were missing from ENSDF were compiled, evaluated and included in NUBASE2016. The atomic mass values were taken from the ‘Atomic Mass Evaluation’ (AME2016, second and third parts of the present issue). In cases where no experimental data were available for a particular nuclide, trends in the behavior of specific properties in neighboring nuclides (TNN) were examined. This approach allowed to estimate values for a range of properties that are labeled in NUBASE2016 as ‘non-experimental’ (flagged ‘#’). Evaluation procedures and policies used during the development of this database are presented, together with a detailed table of recommended values and their uncertainties.

An advanced experimental program including new and unique concepts promises a new quality in investigations of nuclei far away from stability. A brief overview on the facility is presented with emphasis on the radioactive-beam facility. The experimental program and its related instrumentation is discussed briefly."

It builds on advanced techniques implemented in the prototype version of the CSC, which has recently been commissioned as part of the FRS Ion Catcher with 238U projectile and fission fragments produced at 1000MeV/u. These techniques include cryogenic operation to ensure a high purity of the stopping gas and high-density operation enabled using an RF carpet with a small electrode structure size. The next generation CSC implements several novel concepts (e.g. perpendicular extraction) which lead to enhanced performance compared to the prototype CSC: (i) extremely short extraction times, (ii) higher rate capability, (iii) increased areal density without deteriorating extraction times, efficiencies or rate capability, (iv) minimized RF power, (v) precise range measurement of the ions and (vii) improved cleanliness of the CSC."

abstract = "A new probability distribution function (PDF) called hyper-Exponentially Modified Gaussian (hyper-EMG) is introduced for the analysis of high-resolution spectra from multiple-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometers. The hyper-EMG consists of a central Gaussian distribution modified by multiple exponential tails with different strengths at one or both sides. The basic statistical properties of the new PDF are given and the analysis of mass spectra containing separated and overlapping peaks is presented. The main requirement is to accurately determine the positions and areas of the individual mass peaks. From the distances of positions the mass values can be determined, from the areas the population of different ground and isomeric states can be obtained. The hyper-EMG has been applied to high-resolution time and mass spectra characterized by mass resolving powers of 140,000 and 520,000 obtained with Cs+133 and K+39 ions, respectively. From the measured mass distribution of K+39 ions, an overlapping distribution of two peaks with an area ratio of 1:10 and a mass difference of 2.6ppm (parts-per-million) is generated and analyzed. The results reveal significant advantages of the new PDF for the evaluation of overlapping distributions for accurate mass and area determinations compared with commonly used PDFs which are more than one order of magnitude less accurate. It is obvious that the hyper-EMG can be favorably applied also to other fields."

After various storage times, the remaining mother nuclides were mass separated from accompanying isobaric contaminations by the multi-reflection time-of-flight mass separator (MR-ToF MS), allowing for a background-free ion counting. A feasibility study with several online measurements shows that the applications of the ISOLTRAP setup can be further extended by exploiting the high resolving power of the MR-ToF MS in combination with in-trap decay and single-ion counting."

abstract="A novel method for simultaneous measurement of masses, Q-values, isomer excitation energies, half-lives and decay branching ratios of exotic nuclei has been demonstrated. The method includes first use of a stopping cell as an ion trap, combining storage of mother and daughter nuclides for variable durations in a cryogenic stopping cell (CSC), and afterwards the identification and counting of them by a multiple-reflection time-of-flight mass spectrometer (MR-TOF-MS). We utilized our method to record the decay and growth of the 216Po and 212Pb isotopes (alpha decay) and of the 119m2Sb isomer ({\$}t{\_}{\{}1/2{\}} = 850{\backslash}pm 90{\$}t1/2=850{\textpm}90ms) and 119gSb isotope (isomer transition), obtaining half-lives consistent with literature values. The amount of non-nuclear-decay losses in the CSC up to {\$}{\backslash}sim 10{\$}∼10s is negligible, which exhibits its extraordinary cleanliness. For 119Sb isotopes, we present the first direct measurements of the mass of its ground state, and the excitation energy and decay branching ratios of its second isomeric state (119m2Sb). This resolves discrepancies in previous excitation energy data, and is the first direct evidence that the 119m2Sb isomer decays dominantly via {\$}{\backslash}gamma{\$}$\gamma$emission. These results pave the way for the measurement of branching ratios of exotic nuclei.",

abstract = "The Geiger–Nuttall (GN) law relates the partial α-decay half-life with the energy of the escaping α particle and contains for every isotopic chain two experimentally determined coefficients. The expression is supported by several phenomenological approaches, however its coefficients lack a fully microscopic basis. In this paper we will show that: (1) the empirical coefficients that appear in the GN law have a deep physical meaning, and (2) the GN law is successful within the restricted experimental data sets available so far, but is not valid in general. We will show that, when the dependence of logarithm values of the α formation probability on the neutron number is not linear or constant, the GN law is broken. For the α decay of neutron-deficient nucleus 186Po, the difference between the experimental half-life and that predicted by the GN law is as large as one order of magnitude."

We show in a qualitative way that the α-cluster preformation probability (Pα) is significantly changed if protons or neutrons forming the α particle occupy different orbits. In the contrast, Pα along an isotopic chain or an isotonic chain increases when approaching the N=Z line, showing a N/Z-dependence. Through a detailed analysis of Pα, it is found that the α-decay data of 110Te, 110,112,113I, 113,115Xe, and 112Cs can be further updated. Predictions on the α-decay half-lives are also given for nuclei in the island of light α-emitters which have not yet been observed up to now."

The alpha decay half lives for parent nuclei with atomic number Z=106 onwards were compared with experimental data and are found to be in good agreement with each other. A semi-empirical formula for alpha decay half lives has been formulated by making least squares fit to the available experimental data. The new semi-empirical formula was used for calculating half lives of isotopes of nuclei in the chosen range 100⩽Z⩽120. These results when compared with the corresponding experimental half life values and the values calculated using GLDM and Viola–Seaborg systematics showed good agreement."

abstract = "The r-process of nucleosynthesis is the process which is responsible for the synthesis of approximately half of the nuclear species in nature that are more massive than iron. This process of heavy-element synthesis involves the progressive buildup of heavier isotopes via neut ron captures proceeding on neutron-rich isotopes, interspersed by beta decays. Its abudance features clearly reflect nuclear propeties — the maxima are related to the magic neutron numbers N = 50, 82 and 126. It probes our knowledge of the properties of nuclei far from the region of beta stability, even through the position of the neutron drip line. The r-process also forms the important long-lived nuclear chronometers 232Th, 238U and 235U that are utilized for dating the Galaxy. While the astrophysical site foprocess nucleosynthesis is not yet identified, its association with massive stars undergoing type II supernova events is strongly suggested. This can be deduced from the observation that r-process nuclei are already present in the oldest and most metal-deficient stars, which are the tracers of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. The massive stars that become type II supernovae evolve fastest and contribute their ejecta to the interstellar medium at the earliest beginnings of the chemical evolution of the Galaxy. When utilizing the knowledge of the r-process production ratios of the long-lived chronometer nuclei, their observed ratios in primitive meteorites and our (limited) knowledge of star formation throughout galactic evolution, one can put limits on the duration of galactic nucleosynthesis, the age of the Galaxy and the universe. The latter has a large uncertainty but is comparable with ages estimated from globular clusters and cosmology. This paper will provide a review of the basic physics underlying the r-process, the operation of the mechanisms for r-process nucleosynthesis, the possible astrophysical sites, their time evolution in galactic evolution models, and the inferred ages of the Galaxy."

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {The slow neutron capture process in massive stars (weak s process) produces most of the s-process isotopes between iron and strontium. Neutrons are provided by the 22Ne(α,n)25Mg reaction, which is activated at the end of the convective He-burning core and in the subsequent convective C-burning shell. The s-process-rich material in the supernova ejecta carries the signature of these two phases. In the past years, new measurements of neutron capture cross sections of isotopes beyond iron significantly changed the predicted weak s-process distribution. The reason is that the variation of the Maxwellian-averaged cross sections (MACS) is propagated to heavier isotopes along the s path. In the light of these results, we present updated nucleosynthesis calculations for a 25 M
            ☉ star of Population I (solar metallicity) in convective He-burning core and convective C-burning shell conditions. In comparison with previous simulations based on the Bao et al. compilation, the new measurement of neutron capture cross sections leads to an increase of s-process yields from nickel up to selenium. The variation of the cross section of one isotope along the s-process path is propagated to heavier isotopes, where the propagation efficiency is higher for low cross sections. New 74Ge, 75As, and 78Se MACS result in a higher production of germanium, arsenic, and selenium, thereby reducing the s-process yields of heavier elements by propagation. Results are reported for the He core and for the C shell. In shell C-burning, the s-process nucleosynthesis is more uncertain than in the He core, due to higher MACS uncertainties at higher temperatures. We also analyze the impact of using the new lower solar abundances for CNO isotopes on the s-process predictions, where CNO is the source of 22Ne, and we show that beyond Zn this is affecting the s-process yields more than nuclear or stellar model uncertainties considered in this paper. In particular, using the new updated initial composition, we obtain a high s-process production (overproduction higher than 16O, ∼100) for Cu, Ga, Ge, and As. Using the older abundances by Anders & Grevesse, also Se, Br, Kr, and Rb are efficiently produced. Our results have important implications in explaining the origin of copper in the solar abundance distribution, pointing to a prevailing contribution from the weak s-process in agreement with spectroscopic observations and Galactic chemical evolution calculations. Because of the improvement due to the new MACS for nickel and copper isotopes, the nucleosynthesis of copper is less affected by nuclear uncertainties compared to heavier s-process elements. An experimental determination of the 63Ni MACS is required for a further improvement of the abundance prediction of copper. The available spectroscopic observations of germanium and gallium in stars are also discussed, where most of the cosmic abundances of these elements derives from the s-process in massive stars.}

For a given signal-to-noise ratio and resolution, the FT-ICR method generates a spectrum in a time which is two orders of magnitude shorter than that required in conventional slow-sweep ICR detection.

The lower lifetime limit of the presently existing methods for mass measurements on these nuclides at the ESR is about a few seconds. We have developed and investigated an isochronous operational mode of the ESR, that makes mass measurements of nuclides with lifetimes down to a few μs feasible. It has been commissioned in experiments using long-lived nuclides with known masses. A mass resolving power of about 150000 has been achieved in a first pilot experiment. A suitable detector system has been implemented and commissioned at the ESR that allows measurements of the revolution period of single particles within a few turns in the ESR."

However, the short-lived beta-decaying nuclei have to be produced on-line in order to provide a large enough sample to carry out the experiments. At the new ISAC (Isotope Separator and Accelerator) facility at the TRIUMF national laboratory in Vancouver, Canada, ideal conditions are provided for the production of some of the most interesting nuclides in that respect. The experimental information that is needed are branching ratio, half-life and Q-value of the specific beta decay. For the first two components experiments have already been carried out or are in preparation at ISAC (Ball et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 86 (2001) 1454, and experiments E823 and E909 approved at TRIUMF), for the third one, we are proposing to set up a unique facility capable of high accuracy mass measurements δm/m⩽1×10−8 on very short-lived isotopes (T1/2⩽50ms) employing a Penning trap spectrometer coupled to an electron beam ion trap (EBIT) for charge breeding. The main goal of TITAN is mass measurements, however, the unique combination of the systems will allow to carry out high precision measurements in other fields of nuclear and also atomic physics."

The Coulomb exchange contributions are calculated exactly. We use extended Skyrme energy density functionals (EDFs) with proton–neutron-mixed densities, to which we add new terms breaking the isospin symmetry. Two parameters associated with the new terms are determined by fitting mirror and triplet displacement energies (MDEs and TDEs) of isospin multiplets. The new EDFs reproduce MDEs for the T=12 doublets and T=1 triplets, and TDEs for the T=1 triplets. Relative strengths of the obtained isospin-symmetry-breaking terms are not consistent with the differences in the NN scattering lengths, ann, app, and anp. Based on low-energy experimental data, it seems thus impossible to delineate the strong-force ISB effects from beyond-mean-field Coulomb-energy corrections."

The Advanced Rare Isotope Separator (ARIS) has been designed as a three-stage fragment separator for the efficient collection and purification of the rare isotope beams of interest. A vertically bending preseparator (first stage) with production target and beam dump is fully integrated into a production target facility hot cell with remote handling. The new separator compresses the accepted momentum width of up to ±5\% of the beam by a factor of three in the standard operational mode. Provisions for alternate operational modes for specific cases are included in the design. This preseparator is followed by two, horizontally-bending separator stages (second and third stages) utilizing the magnets from the existing A1900 fragment separator at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL). These stages can alternatively be coupled to a single high-resolution separator stage, resulting in the flexibility to optimize the operation for different experiments, including momentum tagging and in-flight particle identification of rare isotope beams. The design of ARIS will be presented with an emphasis on beam physics characteristics, and anticipated operational modes will be described."

abstract = "Unlike their lighter counterparts, most odd-odd N = Z nuclei with mass A > 40 have ground states with isospin T = 1, suggesting an increased role for the isovector pairing interaction. A simple SO(5) seniority-like model of this interaction reveals a striking and heretofore unnoticed interplay between like-particle and neutron-proton isovector pairing near N = Z that is reflected in the number of each kind of pair as a function of A and T. Large scale shell-model calculations exhibit the same trends, despite the simultaneous presence of isoscalar pairs, deformation, and other correlations."

abstract = "A cranked shell model approach for the description of rotational bands in N ≈ Z nuclei is formulated. The isovector neutron-proton pairing is taken into account explicitly. The concept of spontaneous breaking and subsequent restoration of the isospin symmetry turns out to be crucial. The general rules to construct the near yrast spectra for rotating nuclei are presented. For the model case of particles in a j-shell, it is shown that excitation spectra and the alignment processes are well described as compared to the exact shell model calculation. Realistic cranked shell model calculations are able to describe the experimental spectra of 72,73Kr and 74Rb isotopes."

The projectile fragments were thermalized in 51cm of helium at 1bar and were transported by electric fields and gas flow into an expansion chamber through a supersonic nozzle, guided by an radio frequency quadrupole (RFQ) guide and collected on a metallic wire. The extraction efficiency was measured for different implantation rates, different electrical field distributions inside the gas cell, and different values of beam degrader thicknesses. The extraction measurements were compared with the experimental stopping efficiency and measurement of ionization induced in the helium gas. Mechanisms responsible for ion losses were identified and possible improvements of the gas cell performance were discussed.}

The National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) has designed and fabricated a new cryogenic gas stopper to maximize efficiency and beam rate capability in order to increase scientific reach at the facility. The Advanced Cryogenic Gas Stopper (ACGS) will increase extraction efficiency, reduce transport time, reduce molecular contamination of the isotope of interest, and minimize space charge effects. A novel 4-phase Radio Frequency wire-carpet generates a traveling electrical wave for fast ion transport, cryogenic cooling of the helium gas chamber reduces unwanted molecular formation, and the new planar geometry with the wire-carpet in the mid-plane of stopper alleviates space charge effects. Prototype testing of ACGS components have shown wire-carpet transport efficiencies greater than 95\% and transport speeds up to 100 m/s. This presentation will show the first online tests with radioactive beams and report the efficiencies of the ACGS.}

The cell has a stopping volume with a length of 1 m and a diameter of 25 cm. It is aimed at operation with high-density helium gas (up to 0.2 mg/cm3). Ours is the first realisation of a stopping cell in which the required purity of the helium stopping gas is ensured by operation at cryogenic temperatures. On the exit side, the ions are guided to the exit hole by an RF carpet with 4 electrodes per mm, operating at a frequency of 5.8 MHz. We present the first commissioning results of the cryogenic stopping cell. Using 219Rn ions emitted as alpha-decay recoils from a 223Ra source, a combined ion survival and extraction efficiency between 10 and 25\% is measured for helium gas at a temperature of 85 K and with a density up to 0.07 mg/cm3 (equivalent to a pressure of 430 mbar at room temperature). This density is almost two times higher than demonstrated up to now for RF ion repelling structures in helium gas. Given the operational and design parameters of the system, it is projected that this technology is useful up to a helium gas density of at least 0.2 mg/cm3.}
