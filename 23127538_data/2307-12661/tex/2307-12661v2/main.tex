\begin{abstract}
	This article presents a novel numerically tractable technique for synthesizing Lyapunov functions for equilibria of nonlinear vector fields. In broad strokes, corresponding to an isolated equilibrium point of a given vector field, a selection is made of a compact neighborhood of the equilibrium and a dictionary of functions in which a Lyapunov function is expected to lie. Then an algorithmic procedure based on the recent work \cite{ref:DasAraCheCha-22} is deployed on the preceding neighborhood-dictionary pair and charged with the task of finding a function satisfying a compact family of inequalities that defines the behavior of a Lyapunov function on the selected neighborhood. The technique applies to continuous nonlinear vector fields without special algebraic structures and does not even require their analytical expressions to proceed. Several numerical examples are presented to illustrate our results.

%\begin{itemize}[label=\(\circ\), leftmargin=*]
%	\item Use the macro \texttt{\textbackslash{}pmat} for matrices: check the style file for the syntax.
%
%	\item Never use vertical bars in tables unless absolutely necessary --- \textbf{vertical bars are for prisons}. Here's one example lifted from the numerical section:
%		\begin{table}[H]
%		    \begin{center}
%		    \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.5}
%			    \begin{tabular}{cl}
%				    \toprule
%					$\damp$ & Lyapunov Function $x\mapsto\lyapfn(x)$ \\
%					\midrule
%				    1 & $0.7819\state_1^2 - 0.3008\state_1\state_2 + 0.6712\state_2^2$ \\
%				    2 & $0.8149\state_1^2 -0.2985\state_1\state_2 + 0.6150\state_2^2$ \\
%				    3 & $0.8336\state_1^2 -0.2966\state_1\state_2 + 0.5640\state_2^2$ \\
%				    \bottomrule
%			    \end{tabular}

%			\caption{\label{table_pendulum} Lyapunov function $x\mapsto\lyapfn(x)$ for different values of $\damp$ for damped pendulum }

%
%		Here's a template for such tables from the \texttt{booktabs} package:\\
%		\begin{center}
%		\begin{tabular}{@{}llr@{}} \toprule
%			\multicolumn{2}{c}{Item} \\ \cmidrule(r){1-2}
%			Animal & Description & Price (\$)\\ \midrule
%			Gnat & per gram & 13.65 \\
%			& each & 0.01 \\
%			Gnu & stuffed & 92.50 \\
%			Emu & stuffed & 33.33 \\
%			Armadillo & frozen & 8.99 \\ \bottomrule
%		\end{tabular}
%		\end{center}
%
%	\item Use the macro \texttt{\textbackslash{}inprod} to match vertical spacing.
%	\item Use the commands of the package \texttt{derivative} to stay consistent.
%	\item Don't be sloppy: \(V(x)\) is the value of \(V\) at \(x\), let's write either \(x\mapsto V(x)\) or \(V(\cdot)\) for functions. Match parentheses according to the vertical extent of their contents, but don't blindly employ \texttt{\textbackslash{}left(, \textbackslash{}right)}, etc. Check how the previous sections are written. Each sentence should terminate with a period: `.'
%	\item Numbers and legends in the figures should be \textbf{eminently} readable.
%	\item ``Van der Pol'' \(\to\) ``van der Pol''.
%	\item There should \textbf{never} be a space \emph{before} a colon `:', but a spaace \emph{after} a colon should \textbf{never} be omitted.
%
%	\item Each example should begin with a description of the system under consideration and then a selection of a candidate Lyapunov triplet. Refer to the appropriate sections as needed. Then present the outcome of your numerical experiments in a scientific way; provide ``proof'' of convergence --- several sample paths of the annealing algorithm would suffice. Then provide a figure of the constructed Lyapunov function in 3D (to be done).

\section{Concluding remarks}
\label{s:concl}
%% =============================================================================

We have given an exposition of a numerically tractable technique for finding Lyapunov functions to test two types of stability properties of equilibria of continuous finite-dimensional vector fields. These two properties are representational, and our technique carries over to other qualitative properties of equilibria that are captured (equivalently) by means of appropriate pointwise behavior of Lyapunov-like functions. Indeed, the technique readily applies to robust and stochastic versions of stability and, as such, will be useful for verifying input-to-state stability (ISS) and its allied versions in the robust setting, as well as for verifying different types of stochastic stability. Extensions of our results to the synthesis of control Lyapunov functions can also be readily carried out by means of our techniques. Results along some of the aforementioned directions will be reported subsequently.
