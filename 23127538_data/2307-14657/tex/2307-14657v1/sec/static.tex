\subsubsection{Feature importance} 
The values in the table are averaged across all the rounds.
I would discuss general importance and then one vs all classifiers to show that
for some families the importance of the features is not the same.

Correlate with VT score

\subsubsection{Singleton} 
Binary classification: here we are using previously trained classifiers to
predict on unseen samples that are not classified by AVClass in any family we
used to train our models. Average accuracy is 94.28 (i.e., it drops slightly
less than 2\% with respect to the classifier trained on the 670 families)

\subsubsection{Unseen families}
Binary classification: here we are using previously trained classifiers to
predict on samples that belong to families that we did not use in our study
(e.g., those families do not reach 100 samples. Average accuracy drops
significantly to 81.50\% with std 2.27\% (i.e., )
