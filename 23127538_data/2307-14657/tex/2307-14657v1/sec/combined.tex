\section{Combining static and dynamic features} 
\label{sec:static}

\subsection{Feature merging}
Explain the that we take the top 70,170,..,670 according to dynamic analysis and
compute static features accordingly. We then run the classifier for both binary
and family classification

\subsection{Binary classification}
Results clearly improve for binary classification. The reported confusion matrix
refers to the case with 70 families (best case). For 670 families accuracy drops
just of 1.5\%

\subsection{Family classification}
Results clearly improve for a few families (e.g., 70,170). But then it looks
like the contribution of dynamic features does not add anything to static.
Results are available for the best and worst families for all the cases (e.g.,
70,170, and so on). However since the number of families is different, it's
difficult to have a single table.
