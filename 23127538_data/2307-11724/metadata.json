  "abstract": "We describe the application of the quantum mechanical bootstrap to the solution of one-dimensional scattering problems. By fixing a boundary and modulating the Robin parameter of the boundary conditions we are able to extract the reflection coefficient for various potentials and compare to physical expectations. This includes an application of semidefinite programming to solving a half-line Schrodinger problem with arbitrary Robin boundary conditions. Finally, the WKB approximation is used to numerically determine the scattering behavior of the exponential potential of Liouville theory.",
