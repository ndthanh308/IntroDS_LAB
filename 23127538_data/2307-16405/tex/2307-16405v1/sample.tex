\begin{abstract}%   <- trailing '%' for backward compatibility of .sty file
Causal discovery aims at revealing causal relations from observational data, which is a fundamental task in science and engineering. We describe \textit{causal-learn}, an open-source Python library for causal discovery. This library focuses on bringing a comprehensive collection of causal discovery methods to both practitioners and researchers. It provides easy-to-use APIs for non-specialists, modular building blocks for developers, detailed documentation for learners, and comprehensive methods for all. Different from previous packages in R or Java, \textit{causal-learn} is fully developed in Python, which could be more in tune with the recent preference shift in programming languages within related communities. The library is available at \url{https://github.com/py-why/causal-learn}.
