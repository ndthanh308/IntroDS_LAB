\section{Example}



In this section, let us demonstrate how \textit{causal-learn} discovers causal relations from observational data in one line of code. First, we could easily install the library via pip:
\begin{lstlisting}
pip install causal-learn
\end{lstlisting}
Then we are ready to take a look into the causal world. Causal discovery in Python is as simple as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
# apply PC with default parameters
cg = pc(data)

# visualization
cg.draw_pydot_graph()
\end{lstlisting}
The visualization of the returned causal graph is shown in Figure \ref{fig:example}.
