\section{Conclusion}

\looseness=-1
The \textit{causal-learn} library serves as a comprehensive toolset for causal discovery, significantly advancing the field of causal analysis and its applications in domains such as machine learning. It provides a robust platform for not only applying causal analysis techniques but also for facilitating the development of novel or enhanced algorithms. This is achieved by providing an infrastructure fully in Python that allows users to efficiently modify, extend, and tailor existing implementations, contribute new ones, and maintain high-quality standards. Given the current demand for causal learning and the rapid progress in this field, coupled with the active development and contribution from our team and the community, the \textit{causal-learn} library is poised to bring causality into an indispensable component across diverse disciplines.
