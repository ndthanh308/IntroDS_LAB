\bbot\ is a platform capable of both field monitoring and weed management developed at the University of Bonn.
The base platform is a Thorvald system~\cite{grimstad2017thorvald} which is a lightweight four-wheel-drive (4WD) and four-wheel-steering (4WS) system.
With considerable modifications, we adapted this platform to an arable farming and phenotyping robot suitable for operation in the real phenotyping fields.

These modifications were carried out to ensure they met European farming standards for the distance between rows.
Based on these specifications the width from wheel-centre-to-wheel-centre was set to $1.5m$.
To ensure we could monitor the different growth cycles of our primary crops (sugar beet, wheat, and corn) the vertical clearance is set to $0.57m$.
The length of BonnBot-I, $1.39m$, was selected to ensure there was adequate space to install replicating weeding tools.
These dimensions also act to increase the stability of the platform on the uneven terrain witnessed in arable farmland.
An overview of the \bbot\ platform is provided in~\figref{fig:fields}.

% \TODO{CM to ALL: I would remove the paragraph below.
% Key to deploying \bbot\ is the sensor array enabling navigation, data capture, crop monitoring and weed management at the same time.
% Hence, \bbot\ houses sensors of multiple interests: localization, navigation and crop monitoring encouraging operations in a vast variety of crop-fields with different growth-stages, number of crop-rows. 
% Additionally, benefiting our novel weeding tool implement, we are able to conduct selective and precision plant-level interventions in arable fields.
% For more platform details see~\ref{fig:fields}, on the left is a detailed schematic of the robot and on the right is a 3D generated model. These images detail the construction level specifics of \bbot\.
% In the following we elaborate more on sensor setup and weeding implement.}

% The placement of the GPS antennas was chosen to be consistent with a second purely phenotyping platform. 
% The purely phenotyping platform was chosen to have a vertical clearance of $1.6m$ and to ensure consistency between the two platforms the antennas of \bbot\ were mounted at the same position.}
% \TODO{CM to AA: I suggest we mainly talk about the dimensions of the weeding platform. I've commented the previous text and then talked about there being another robot for phenotyping that constrained where the GPS antennas had to be mounted.}
% \textcolor{blue}{
% the phenotyping version of this robot had to be able to sense a variety of crops at different stages of growth.
% This led to the choice of a vertical clearance of $1.6m$.
% The length of the robot was then set to ensure room for weeding tools and was set to $1.4m$, this also reduced issues for instability.}
% \TODO{The above dimensions need to have the real numbers for vertical clearance and area for the weeding tools. Workshop?}
% This led to the overall dimensions of the robot of $1.62 \times 1.8 \times 2.175m$ (width, length, height), as shown in Figure~\ref{}.
% With these parameters, this lightweight robot could be mounted on a regular truck provided that the GPS antennas were rotated, see Figure~\ref{}.
% \TODO{We need the details of the truck with dimensions, etc. Workshop?}
