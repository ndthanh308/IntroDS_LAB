\begin{abstract}

Cultivation and weeding are two of the primary tasks performed by farmers today.
A recent challenge for weeding is the desire to reduce herbicide and pesticide treatments while maintaining crop quality and quantity.
In this paper we introduce \bbot\ a precise weed management platform which can also performs field monitoring.
Driven by crop monitoring approaches which can accurately locate and classify plants (weed and crop) we further improve their performance by fusing the platform available GNSS and wheel odometry.
This improves tracking accuracy of our crop monitoring approach from a normalized average error of $8.3\%$ to $3.5\%$, evaluated on a new publicly available corn dataset.
We also present a novel arrangement of weeding tools mounted on linear actuators evaluated in simulated environments.
We replicate weed distributions from a real field, using the results from our monitoring approach, and show the validity of our work-space division techniques which require significantly less movement (a $50\%$ reduction) to achieve similar results.
Overall, \bbot\ is a significant step forward in precise weed management with a novel method of selectively spraying and controlling weeds in an arable field.

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conc}

In this paper, we introduced \bbot\ a crop monitoring and weeding platform specifically designed for European phenotyping fields.
We showed how \bbot\ can greatly improving crop monitoring, reducing the NAE from $8.3\%$ to $3.5\%$, by combining the extra localization sensors it has available.
Furthermore, we present a novel arrangement of weeding tools mounted on linear actuators along with three associated target planning approaches.
These target planning approaches were evaluated in simulated environments which are able to mirror real-world weed distributions by using the results from our field monitoring approach.
Experiments on these simulated real-world fields demonstrated the validity of our proposed work-space division techniques and showed that they led to significantly less movement ($10m$ compared to $5m$) when compared to distance-based target assignment.
Finally, we found that while the real-world data was generally uniform in future any planning systems should be evaluated on real-world weed distributions.

\begin{comment}
In this paper, we introduced \bbot\ a crop monitoring and weeding platform specifically designed for European phenotyping fields.
\bbot\ can operate on a wide range of crop fields and in different growth-stages and conduct precision plant-level weed management using its novel multi-head weeding tool.
We showed how sensor fusion can greatly improving crop monitoring from an NAE of $8.3\%$ to $3.5\%$.
We also present a novel arrangement of weeding tools mounted on linear actuators along with associated planning approaches.
Three approaches for target management were proposed and then evaluated in simulated environments which replicated real-world weed distributions by using the results from our field monitoring approach.
Experiments on these simulated real-world fields demonstrated the validity of our proposed work-space division techniques and showed that they led to significantly less movement ($10m$ compared to $5m$) when compared to distance-based target assignment.
%Overall, \bbot\ is a significant step forward in precise weed management with a novel method of selectively spraying and controlling weeds in an arable field.
%Also, we introduced a weeding simulation framework capable of replicating real field plant distributions which is used for developing and evaluating our weeding strategies.
%We discussed three techniques for target management which outlines path planning on real data showing their validity in balancing the load of intervention between axes of weeding tool.
%An important conclusion from our results on, real-world weed distributions, is that any future work should not assume that weed distributions are uniform.
Finally, we found that while the real-world data was generally uniform, in future any planning systems should allow for areas in the field that contain more aggressive weed densities.
