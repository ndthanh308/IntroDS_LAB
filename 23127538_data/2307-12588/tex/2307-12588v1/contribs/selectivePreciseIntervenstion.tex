\bbot\ is equipped with a novel weeding tool design enabling high precision plant-level field interventions. 
It consists of a set of replicated linear actuators and is controlled via the intervention controller unit consisting of several components which are elaborated in the following sections.
%The weeding implement is controlled via the intervention controller unit consisting of several components which are elaborated in the following sections.
We briefly explain the conceptual design of the weeding tool, its requirements and operation assumptions.
Then, we introduce our method for managing targets in the work-space of the weeding tools.
Finally, we elaborate on path planning strategies used for controlling intervention heads in action.

% To properly deploy proposed weeding implement one important challenges is how to efficiently plan paths for intervention heads, such that we minimize the number of not managed weeds in a weeding scenario.

% We define the weeding scenario as below:
% \RNum{1} weeds get detected, classified an tracked within the view-able area of down facing camera $C_{detect}$ via monitoring system explained in~\secref{subsec:cropWeedMonitoring}.
% \RNum{2} the track-lets of each detected instance is being passed to a proper weeding actuator weeding-tool manager node.
% \RNum{3} each intervention path planner plans an optimal path and action time relative to meta information of each track-let like: weed type, size and category as it is explained in ??? in more details. 
% \RNum{4} goal target commands gets published through ROS, sending nozzle on actuator $i$ to requested target $j$.
% \RNum{5} valve of nozzles get activated based on heads pose relative to target weed (stem or bbox?)
