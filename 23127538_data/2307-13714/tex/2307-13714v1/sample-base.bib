BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.}, booktitle={Proceedings of the 2021 ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency}, publisher={Association for Computing Machinery}, author={Bender, Emily M. and Gebru, Timnit and McMillan-Major, Angelina and Shmitchell, Shmargaret}, year={2021}, pages={610–623}, collection={FAccT ’21} }

According to veritistic unitarianism, justification is a distinct epistemic value from truth but derives its value from that of true belief. This is explicit in reliabilism and implicit in many varieties of foundationalism and coherentism. Deontological evidentialism rejects veritistic consequentialism but has trouble accounting for evidence‐gathering virtues. The claim that “pragmatic” epistemic virtues are unrelated to truth is examined but found unpersuasive or readily accommodated with minor tweakings of the veritistic perspective.}, booktitle={Pathways to Knowledge: Private and Public}, publisher={Oxford University Press}, author={Goldman, Alvin I.}, year={2002}, month={Jan} }

 @book{Ranciere_1998, address={Minneapolis}, title={Disagreement: Politics and Philosophy}, ISBN={978-0-8166-2844-5}, abstractNote={Is there any such thing as political philosophy? So begins this provocative book by one of the foremost figures in Continental thought. Here, Jacques Rancière brings a new and highly useful set of terms to the vexed debate about political effectiveness and the end of politics.What precisely is at stake in the relationship between philosophy and the adjective political? In Disagreement, Rancière explores the apparent contradiction between these terms and reveals the uneasy meaning of their union in the phrase political philosophya juncture related to age-old attempts in philosophy to answer Platos devaluing of politics as a democratic egalitarian process.According to Rancière, the phrase also expresses the paradox of politics itself: the absence of a proper foundation. Politics, he argues, begins when the demos (the excessive or unrepresented part of society) seeks to disrupt the order of domination and distribution of goods naturalized by police and legal institutions. In addition, the notion of equality operates as a game of contestation that constantly substitutes litigation for political action and community. This game, Rancière maintains, operates by a primary logic of misunderstanding. In turn, political philosophy has always tried to substitute the politics of truth for the politics of appearances.Disagreement investigates the various transformations of this regime of truth and their effects on practical politics. Rancière then distinguishes what we mean by democracy from the practices of a consensual system in order to unravel the ramifications of the fashionable phrase the end of politics. His conclusions will be of interest to readers concerned with political questions from the broadest to the most specific and local.}, publisher={University of Minnesota Press}, author={Ranciere, Jacques}, year={1998}, month={Nov}, language={Englisch} }

The need to further problematise and critically examine participation is nonetheless apparent. This special issue aims to shed light on participation as it unfolds over time during, between and beyond participatory events such as these. Here, we build an overview of existing directions taken by researchers to address the unfolding of participation in IT design over time. We do this by examining existing PD literature and the four contributions to this special issue. We identify two common temporalities in PD, the future-oriented and the project-based, and propose five lenses that may aid researchers in exploring and understanding the temporal dimensions of participation in their projects: the phasic, emergent, retrospective, prospective and long-term lenses. We end with propositions and opportunities for future research directions in PD, highlighting the multi-faceted nature of the temporality of participation.}, number={1}, journal={CoDesign}, publisher={Taylor & Francis}, author={Saad-Sulonen, Joanna and Eriksson, Eva and Halskov, Kim and Karasti, Helena and Vines, John}, year={2018}, month={Jan}, pages={4–16} }

abstract = {Decolonizing discourses teach us that we need to move away from the universalizing ‘grand narratives’ of knowledge production and focus on contextualizing diverse and situated experiences, epistemologies and narratives. Yet, few contributions actively demonstrate what a shift to decolonizing design means in practice. Participatory Design (PD) approaches are particularly well-suited to contributing to contemporary debates of decolonization in design due to PD’s long-standing political traditions and values of equality and empowerment, but even here empirical methods and techniques to fully realize pluriversality in design are lacking. In line with the CHI 2021 theme of Making Waves. Combining Strengths, this interactive workshop will invigorate the debates and practices in HCI of decolonization by bringing together and demonstrating how designers and researchers in diverse global contexts are working with and adapting modes, concepts, methodologies and sensibilities into decolonizing design practices. Not only will this workshop provide new ways of thinking in HCI but also fuse theories and practices to develop truly transcultural approaches to HCI.},

 @book{Fricker_2009, address={Oxford}, title={Epistemic Injustice: Power and the Ethics of Knowing: Power \& the Ethics of Knowing}, ISBN={978-0-19-957052-2}, abstractNote={In this exploration of new territory between ethics and epistemology, Miranda Fricker argues that there is a distinctively epistemic type of injustice, in which someone is wronged specifically in their capacity as a knower. Justice is one of the oldest and most central themes in philosophy, but in order to reveal the ethical dimension of our epistemic practices the focus must shift to injustice. Fricker adjusts the philosophical lens so that we see through to the negative space that is epistemic injustice. The book explores two different types of epistemic injustice, each driven by a form of prejudice, and from this exploration comes a positive account of two corrective ethical-intellectual virtues. The characterization of these phenomena casts light on many issues, such as social power, prejudice, virtue, and the genealogy of knowledge, and it proposes a virtue epistemological account of testimony. In this ground-breaking book, the entanglements of reason and social power are traced in a new way, to reveal the different forms of epistemic injustice and their place in the broad pattern of social injustice.}, publisher={Oxford University Press, USA}, author={Fricker, Miranda}, year={2009}, month={Sep}, language={Englisch} }

While this discourse initially focused on the impact on Western societies, attention is increasingly turning to the consequences for countries and communities in the (Global) Souths. Criticism has mainly focused on the activities of the private sector. In this paper, however, we argue that publicly funded knowledge and technology production projects must also be examined through the lens of this critique. A research project designing and prototyping a diversity-aware social platform with pilot sites in China, Denmark, the United Kingdom, India, Italy, Mexico, Mongolia, and Paraguay is taken as a use case to ask the question: What do we need to do to meet diverse needs and develop innovative knowledge and products that benefit partners from the South and North alike? Our goal is to identify key efforts that are required to break the prevailing cycle of data colonialism and ethnocentric design. We present data from four different pilot sites and reflect on the original concept, as well as progress and results achieved to date. We then compare the experiences and draw five lessons that we believe will help future projects foster more equitable collaboration and achieve outcomes that benefit diverse local communities.}, journal={AoIR Selected Papers of Internet Research}, author={Helm, Paula and Goetzen, Amalia De and Cernuzzi, Luca and Diwakar, Shyam and Hume, Alethia and Ruiz-Correa, Salvador and Gommesen, Niels and Gatica-Perez, Daniel}, year={2022}, language={en} }

Preexisting bias has its roots in social institutions, practices, and attitudes. Technical bias arises from technical constraints of considerations. Emergent bias arises in a context of use. Although others have pointed to bias inparticular computer systems and have noted the general problem, we know of no comparable work that examines this phenomenon comprehensively and which offers a framework for understanding and remedying it. We conclude by suggesting that freedom from bias should by counted amoung the select set of criteria—including reliability, accuracy, and efficiency—according to which the quality of systems in use in society should be judged.}, number={3}, journal={ACM Transactions on Information Systems}, author={Friedman, Batya and Nissenbaum, Helen}, year={1996}, month={Jul}, pages={330–347} }

Perhaps most visible in the rise of platform technologies, big data and concerns about a new era of monopolies, scalability thinking has also permeated public policy in the search for solutions to ?grand societal challenges?, ?mission-oriented innovation? or transformations through experimental ?living labs?. In this paper, we explore this scalability zeitgeist as a key ordering logic of current initiatives in innovation and public policy. We are interested in how the explicit preoccupation with scalability reconfigures political and economic power by invading problem diagnoses and normative understandings of how society and social change function. The paper explores three empirical sites ? platform technologies, living labs and experimental development economics ? to analyze how scalability thinking is rationalized and operationalized. We suggest that social analysis of science and technology needs to come to terms with the ?politics of scaling? as a powerful corollary of the ?politics of technology?, lest we accept the permanent absence from key sites where decisions about the future are made. We focus in on three constitutive elements of the politics of scaling: solutionism, experimentalism and future-oriented valuation. Our analysis seeks to expand our vocabulary for understanding and questioning current modes of innovation that increasingly value scaling as an end in itself, and to open up new spaces for alternative trajectories of social transformation.}, number={1}, journal={Social Studies of Science}, publisher={SAGE Publications Ltd}, author={Pfotenhauer, Sebastian and Laurent, Brice and Papageorgiou, Kyriaki and Stilgoe, and Jack}, year={2022}, month={Feb}, pages={3–34}, language={en} }

Imaginaries of innovation and the ‘MIT model’ in three political cultures}, volume={47}, DOI={10.1177/0306312717706110}, abstractNote={Innovation studies continue to struggle with an apparent disconnect between innovation’s supposedly universal dynamics and a sense that policy frameworks and associated instruments of innovation are often ineffectual or even harmful when transported across regions or countries. Using a cross-country comparative analysis of three implementations of the ‘MIT model’ of innovation in the UK, Portugal and Singapore, we show how key features in the design, implementation and performance of the model cannot be explained as mere variations on an identical solution to the same underlying problem. We draw on the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries to show how implementations of the ‘same’ innovation model – and with it the notion of ‘innovation’ itself – are co-produced with locally specific diagnoses of a societal deficiency and equally specific understandings of acceptable remedies. Our analysis thus flips the conventional notion of ‘best-practice transfer’ on its head: Instead of asking ‘how well’ an innovation model has been implemented, we analyze the differences among the three importations to reveal the idiosyncratic ways in which each country imagines the purpose of innovation. We replace the notion of innovation as a ‘panacea’ – a universal fix for all social woes – with that of innovation-as-diagnosis in which a particular ‘cure’ is ‘prescribed’ for a ‘diagnosed’ societal ‘pathology,’ which may in turn trigger ‘reactions’ within the receiving body. This approach offers new possibilities for theorizing how and where culture matters in innovation policy. It suggests that the ‘successes’ and ‘failures’ of innovation models are not a matter of how well societies are able to implement a sound, universal model, but more about how effectively they articulate their imaginaries of innovation and tailor their strategies accordingly.}, number={6}, journal={Social Studies of Science}, author={Pfotenhauer, Sebastian and Jasanoff, Sheila}, year={2017}, pages={783–810} }

 @article{Harding_1995, title={“Strong Objectivity”: A Response to the New Objectivity Question}, volume={104}, ISSN={0039-7857}, abstractNote={Where the old “objectivity question” asked, “Objectivity or relativism: which side are you on?”, the new one refuses this choice, seeking instead to bypass widely recognized problems with the conceptual framework that restricts the choices to these two. It asks, “How can the notion of objectivity be updated and made useful for contemporary knowledge-seeking projects?” One response to this question is the “strong objectivity” program that draws on feminist standpoint epistemology to provide a kind of logic of discovery for maximizing our ability to block “might makes right” in the sciences. It does so by delinking the neutrality ideal from standards for maximizing objectivity, since neutrality is now widely recognized as not only not necessary, not only not helpful, but, worst of all, an obstacle to maximizing objectivity when knowledge-distorting interests and values have constituted a research project. Strong objectivity provides a method for correcting this kind of situation. However, standpoint approaches have their own limitations which are quite different from the misreadings of them upon which most critics have tended to focus. Unfortunately, historically limited epistemologies and philosophies of science are all we get to choose from at this moment in history.}, number={3}, journal={Synthese}, publisher={Springer}, author={Harding, Sandra}, year={1995}, pages={331–349} }

abstract = {The past 3 years of work in NLP have been characterized by the development and deployment of ever larger language models, especially for English. BERT, its variants, GPT-2/3, and others, most recently Switch-C, have pushed the boundaries of the possible both through architectural innovations and through sheer size. Using these pretrained models and the methodology of fine-tuning them for specific tasks, researchers have extended the state of the art on a wide array of tasks as measured by leaderboards on specific benchmarks for English. In this paper, we take a step back and ask: How big is too big? What are the possible risks associated with this technology and what paths are available for mitigating those risks? We provide recommendations including weighing the environmental and financial costs first, investing resources into curating and carefully documenting datasets rather than ingesting everything on the web, carrying out pre-development exercises evaluating how the planned approach fits into research and development goals and supports stakeholder values, and encouraging research directions beyond ever larger language models.},

 @book{Engel_2016, address={Cheltenham, UK}, edition={Reprint edition}, title={Global Clusters of Innovation: Entrepreneurial Engines of Economic Growth Around the World}, ISBN={978-1-78643-434-0}, abstractNote={Entrepreneurship and innovation are the drivers of value creation in the twenty-first century. In the geography of the global economy there are “hot spots” where new technologies germinate at an astounding rate and pools of capital, expertise, and talent foster the development of new industries, and new ways of doing business. These clusters of innovation have key attributes distinct from traditional industrial clusters that allow them to extend beyond geographic boundaries and serve as models for economic expansion in both developed and developing countries. How do these clusters emerge? What is the role of individual institutions such as governments, universities, major corporations, investors, and the individual entrepreneur? Are there systemic underpinnings, an invisible hand, that encourage these communities?The book begins with a presentation of the Clusters of Innovation Framework> that identifies the salient components, behaviors, and linkages that characterize an innovation cluster, followed by an analysis of the archetypal cluster, Silicon Valley. Subsequent chapters probe how these characteristics apply in a diverse selection of economic communities in Germany, Belgium, Spain, the United Kingdom, Israel, Japan, Taiwan, China, Colombia, Mexico, and Brazil. Concluding chapters investigate the role of transregional organizations as cross-border disseminators of best practices in entrepreneurship and innovation.Students and professors of economics, business, public policy, management, entrepreneurship, and innovation will find this book a useful resource. Corporate executives, university administrators, government officials, policy makers, and entrepreneurs will also find it an insightful guide.Contributors: O. Berry, D. Chapman, J.-M. Chen, S.H.

While the impact of the Digital Age on Western politics has been extensively debated, there is still little appreciation of how it has been felt in developing countries such as Kenya, where Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp and other online platforms are increasingly a part of everyday life.Written by a respected Kenyan activist and researcher at the forefront of political online struggles, this book presents a unique contribution to the debate on digital democracy. For traditionally marginalised groups, particularly women and people with disabilities, digital spaces have allowed Kenyans to build new communities which transcend old ethnic and gender divisions. But the picture is far from wholly positive.Digital Democracy, Analogue Politics explores the drastic efforts being made by elites to contain online activism, as well as how “fake news”, a failed digital vote-counting system and the incumbent president’s recruitment of Cambridge Analytica contributed to tensions around the 2017 elections.
