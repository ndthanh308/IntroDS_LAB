\section{Conclusion}
We have proposed a formal extension of \nnef that takes
into account the \emph{execution model} of a description and
allows for the modification of a description of a trained model
to define  traceable distribution
and parallelisation optimizations that preserves the semantics
while improving the execution time compared to a pure sequential aproach.
We have also proposed a code generation strategy based on barriers
for exchanging data between items.
%As a future work, we would like to extend the \nnef tools to parse our extensions
%and define an automatic code generation in \cuda.
%We will also improve the \gpu utilization to ensure more predictable behaviour.
%We will in particular reuse works from
%\cite{AmertA21,AmertTVBSA21}.
As a future work, a working group has been set up to propose an ONNX aeronautics profile.
