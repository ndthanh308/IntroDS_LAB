  Implementing deep neural networks in safety critical systems,
  in particular in the aeronautical domain,
  will require to offer adequate specification paradigms to 
  preserve
  the semantics of the trained model on the final hardware platform.

   
  In this extended abstract, we briefly sketch how to formally represent neural networks with the \nnef format. We show that \nnef semantic is incomplete and
we propose some principles to extend the semantics in order to have a non ambiguous description.
%
%  
%  In this paper, we are proposing first, to formally defined the semantics of feed forward convolutionnal neural networks and secondly to extend the \nnef language in order to allow traceable distribution
%  and parallelisation optimizations of a trained model.
 %  
%  All implementation details will be done for the final paper.
  
  % Shall we give the reference to the ARXIV paper?


  % We propose to extend the \nnef language
  % in order to allow traceable distribution
  % and parallelisation optimizations of a trained model.
  % We show how such a specification can be
  % implemented in \cuda on a \xavier platform.
