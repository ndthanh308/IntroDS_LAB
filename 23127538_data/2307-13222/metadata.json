  "abstract": "$\\mathcal{H}Φ$ [$aitch$-$phi$] is an open-source software package of numerically exact and stochastic calculations for a wide range of quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we present the newly added functions and the implemented methods in vers. 2 and 3. In ver. 2, we implement spectrum calculations by the shifted Krylov method, and low-energy excited state calculations by the locally optimal blocking preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG) method. In ver. 3, we implement the full diagonalization method using ScaLAPACK and GPGPU computing via MAGMA. We also implement a real-time evolution method and the canonical thermal pure quantum (cTPQ) state method for finite-temperature calculations. The Wannier90 format for specifying the Hamiltonians is also implemented. Using the Wannier90 format, it is possible to perform the calculations for the $ab$ $initio$ low-energy effective Hamiltonians of solids obtained by the open-source software RESPACK. We also update Standard mode $\\unicode{x2014}$simplified input format in $\\mathcal{H}Φ$$\\unicode{x2014}$ to use these functions and methods. We explain the basics of the implemented methods and how to use them.",
