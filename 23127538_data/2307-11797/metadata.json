  "abstract": "In this paper, we prove the existence of $k$ families of smooth unbounded domains $Ω_s\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{N+1}$ with $N\\geq1$, where \\begin{equation} Ω_s=\\left\\{(x,t)\\in \\mathbb{R}^N\\times \\mathbb{R}:\\vert x\\vert<1+s\\cos \\left(\\frac{2π}{T(s)}t\\right)+s w_s\\left(\\frac{2π}{T(s)}t\\right)\\right\\},\\nonumber \\end{equation} such that \\begin{equation} -Δu=λu\\,\\, \\text{in}\\,\\,Ω, \\,\\, \\partial_νu=0,\\,\\,u=\\text{const}\\,\\,\\text{on}\\,\\,\\partialΩ\\nonumber \\end{equation} admits a bounded sign-changing solution with exactly $k+1$ nodal domains. These results can be regarded as counterexamples to the Schiffer conjecture on unbounded domain. These results also indicate that there exist non-spherical unbounded regions without Pompeiu property. Our construction shows that the condition \"$\\partialΩ$ is homeomorphic to the unit sphere\" is necessary for Williams conjecture to hold. In addition, these conclusions may have potential applications in remote sensing or CT.",
