Step adjustment is a critical component for dynamic locomotion of humanoid robots. 
In this work, we present a novel approach for enabling step adjustment on humanoid hardware, including cross-over steps, as well as a better understanding of how reachability constraints affect the ability to regain balance.
We also propose a novel method for varying the transfer duration for stability, as well as using the hip and ankle strategy for balance.
From this approach, it becomes apparent that constraining the footstep adjustment significantly affects the recovery dynamics, and should be accounted for.
We also show from hardware tests and software simulations that the inclusion of cross-over steps enables a much greater ability to recover from inward disturbances.
Transfer adjustment is also extremely beneficial for recovering from large disturbances. 
In the future, we hope to include environmental constraints, such that the robot can perform step adjustment when navigating complex terrain.
