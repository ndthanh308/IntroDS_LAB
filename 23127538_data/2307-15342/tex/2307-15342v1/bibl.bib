Numerical simulations are performed for this model with multiple taxis, in order to assess the solution behavior under several scenarios of taxis and growth for tumor and endothelial cells. An extension of the model to incorporate the macroscopic evolution of normal tissue and necrotic matter provides a basis for performing tumor grading.}
