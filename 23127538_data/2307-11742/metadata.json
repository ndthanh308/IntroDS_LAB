  "abstract": "Polyhydride superconductors have been shown to possess metallic properties with a Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-type superconducting ground state. Here, we provide evidence for unconventional transport associated with a pseudogap phase in cubic cerium superhydride CeH$_{10}$ ($\\textit{T}$$_C$ = 116 K) at pressure of 115-125 GPa. A large negative magnetoresistance in the non-superconducting state below 90 K, quasi $\\textit{T}$-linear electrical resistance, and a sign-change of its temperature dependence mark the emergence of this phase. We studied the magnetic phase diagrams and the upper critical fields $\\textit{B}$$_{C2}$(T) of CeH$_{10}$, CeH$_9$, and CeD$_9$ in pulsed fields up to 70 T. $\\textit{B}$$_{C2}$(T) of CeH$_9$ and CeD$_9$ exhibits pronounced saturation at low temperatures in accordance with the Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg model, whereas CeH$_{10}$ stands out in particular, as it does not obey this model. Our observations, therefore, reveal the unconventional nature of non-superconducting state of cerium superhydride CeH$_{10}$.",
