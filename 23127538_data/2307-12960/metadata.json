  "abstract": "For arbitrary non-equilibrium transformations in complex systems, we show that the distance between the current state and a target state can be decomposed into two terms: one corresponding to an independent estimate of the distance, and another corresponding to interactions, quantified using the relative mutual information between the variables. This decomposition is a special case of a more general decomposition involving successive orders of correlation or interactions among the degrees of freedom of the system. To illustrate its practical significance, we study the thermal relaxation of two interacting, optically trapped colloidal particles, where increasing pairwise interaction strength is shown to prolong the longevity of the time-dependent non-equilibrium state. Additionally, we study a system with both pairwise and triplet interactions, where our approach identifies their distinct contributions to the transformation. In more general setups where it is possible to control the strength of different orders of interactions, our findings provide a way to disentangle their effects and identify interactions that facilitate the transformation.",
