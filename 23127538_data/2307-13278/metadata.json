  "abstract": "In the past twenty years, hadron spectroscopy has made immense progress. Experimental facilities have observed different multiquark states during these years. There are different models and phenomenological potentials to study the nature of interquark interaction. In this work, we have reviewed different quark potentials and models used in hadron spectroscopy.",
