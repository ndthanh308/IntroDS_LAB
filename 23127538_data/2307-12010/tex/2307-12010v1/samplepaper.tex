\begin{abstract}
% Face recognition is a common technique used for identity authentication or verification, where a verifier checks whether a face image matches anyone stored in a database. In case the database is held by another party, say a cloud server, neither party wants to reveal its data due to privacy concerns. We propose \sys, a privacy-preserving face recognition system using homomorphic encryption~(HE) and secure multi-party computation~(MPC). 
% To improve the performance of \sys, we design a new encoding strategy by exploiting the properties of HE, which reduces communication costs and enables efficient similarity checks between face images without expensive homomorphic rotation. 
% Moreover, \sys~leaks less information than the state-of-the-art. 
% We find that existing approaches reveal the similarity between the queried image and each image in the database to the verifier. 
% In CryptoMask, we design a secure result-revealing protocol that only reveals `1' or `0', \ie~there is one image matching the query or not, to the verifier. 
% %We additionally give some optimizations over computation and communication to improve the efficiency of CryptoMask. 
% Extensive experiments illustrate that CryptoMask outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of both computation and communication. For a database with 100 million 512-dimensional face features, CryptoMask offers ${\thicksim}5 \times$ and ${\thicksim}144 \times$ speeds-up in terms of computation and communication, respectively.


% Face recognition is a widely-used technique for identity authentication or verification, where a verifier checks whether a face image matches anyone stored in a database. However, in scenarios where the database is held by a third party, such as a cloud server, both parties are concerned about data privacy. 
% To address this concern, we propose \sys, a privacy-preserving face recognition system that employs homomorphic encryption (HE) and secure multi-party computation (MPC). We have designed a new encoding strategy that leverages HE properties to reduce communication costs and enable efficient similarity checks between face images, without expensive homomorphic rotation. 
% Additionally, \sys~leaks less information than existing state-of-the-art approaches, as it only reveals `1' or `0' to the verifier in our secure result-revealing protocol that determines if there is one image matching the query or not. We have conducted extensive experiments that demonstrate \sys's superior performance in terms of computation and communication. For a database with 100 million 512-dimensional face features, \sys~offers ${\thicksim}5 \times$ and ${\thicksim}144 \times$  speed-ups in terms of computation and communication, respectively.

\sys~only reveals whether there is an image matching the query or not, whereas existing approaches additionally leak sensitive intermediate distance information. We conduct extensive experiments that demonstrate \sys's superior performance in terms of computation and communication. For a database with 100 million 512-dimensional face vectors, \sys~offers ${\thicksim}5 \times$ and ${\thicksim}144 \times$  speed-ups in terms of computation and communication, respectively.
