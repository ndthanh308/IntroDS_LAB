  "abstract": "Discovering a high-performing sparse network within a massive neural network is advantageous for deploying them on devices with limited storage, such as mobile phones. Additionally, model explainability is essential to fostering trust in AI. The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) finds a network within a deep network with comparable or superior performance to the original model. However, limited study has been conducted on the success or failure of LTH in terms of explainability. In this work, we examine why the performance of the pruned networks gradually increases or decreases. Using Grad-CAM and Post-hoc concept bottleneck models (PCBMs), respectively, we investigate the explainability of pruned networks in terms of pixels and high-level concepts. We perform extensive experiments across vision and medical imaging datasets. As more weights are pruned, the performance of the network degrades. The discovered concepts and pixels from the pruned networks are inconsistent with the original network -- a possible reason for the drop in performance.",
