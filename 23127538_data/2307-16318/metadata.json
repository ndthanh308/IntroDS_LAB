  "abstract": "The robot exploration task has been widely studied with applications spanning from novel environment mapping to item delivery. For some time-critical tasks, such as rescue catastrophes, the agent is required to explore as efficiently as possible. Recently, Visit Frequency-based map representation achieved great success in such scenarios by discouraging repetitive visits with a frequency-based penalty. However, its relatively large size and single-agent settings hinder its further development. In this context, we propose Integrated Visit Frequency Map, which encodes identical information as Visit Frequency Map with a more compact size, and a visit frequency-based multi-agent information exchange and control scheme that is able to accommodate both representations. Through tests in diverse settings, the results indicate our proposed methods can achieve a comparable level of performance of VFM with lower bandwidth requirements and generalize well to different multi-agent setups including real-world environments.",
