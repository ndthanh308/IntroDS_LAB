	abstract = {With the advantages of high-performance, easy to build and relatively low cost, the multigap resistive plate chamber has been arousing broad interests over the last few decades. It has become a new standard technology for the time of ﬂight system in high energy physics experiments. In this article, we will give a description of the structure and the operating principles of the MRPC detector and focus on reviewing the applications on the time of ﬂight system in several famous experiments. The performances, including time resolution and particle identiﬁcation, are discussed in detail. Some recent advances and points of view for the future development of the next generation MRPC are also outlined.},

	abstract = {One of the problems in the analysis of nucleus–nucleus collisions is to get information on the value of the impact parameter b. This work consists in the application of pattern recognition techniques aimed at associating values of b to groups of events. To this end, a support vector machine (SVM) classiﬁer is adopted to analyse multifragmentation reactions. This method allows us to backtrace the values of b through a particular multidimensional analysis. The SVM classiﬁcation consists of two main phases. In the ﬁrst one, known as the training phase, the classiﬁer learns to discriminate events that are generated by a model. In this case we used a classical molecular dynamics (CMD) model for the reaction: 58Ni + 48Ca at 25 A MeV. To check the classiﬁcation of events in the second one, known as the test phase, what has been learned is tested on new events generated by the same model. These new results have been compared to those obtained through others techniques of backtracing the impact parameter (estimate function of b and PCA analysis). This approach better classiﬁes central and peripheral collisions with respect to other techniques. We have ﬁnally performed the SVM classiﬁcation on the experimental data measured by the NUCL-EX Collaboration with CHIMERA apparatus for the previous reaction and we show some results of the method.},

	abstract = {This paper reports the layout of the endcap Time of Flight (eTOF) wall for the External target Experiment (CEE) at the Heavy Ion Research Facility at the Lanzhou—Cooling Storage Ring (HIRFL-CSR), and highlights the forward application of a new sealed technology of Multi-gap Resistive Plate Chamber (MRPC). The sealed MRPC, which uses an integral 3D-printed frame glued with the outermost glass electrodes, can operate in an extremely low gas flux. A sealed MRPC prototype has been assembled and tested under cosmic rays, and performs stably at a 97.5\% efficiency and a 60 ps time resolution. The sealed design, with a small gas volume and good air-tightness, shows its advantages in low gas consumption, little environmental impact, fast high voltage application and others.},

	abstract = {The Cooling Storage Ring (CSR) External-target Experiment (CEE) will be the ﬁrst large-scale nuclear physics experimental device at the CSR of the Heavy-Ion Research Facility in Lanzhou (HIRFL) in China. A new T0 detector has been proposed to measure the multiplicity, angular distribution and timing information of charged particles produced in heavy-ion collisions at the target region. Multi-gap resistive plate chamber (MRPC) technology was chosen as part of the construction of the T0 detector, which provides precision event collision times (T0) and collision geometry information. The prototype was tested with hadron and heavy-ion beams to study its performance. By comparing the experimental results with a Monte Carlo simulation, the time resolution of the MRPCs are found to be better than ∼ 50 ps. The timing performance of the T0 detector, including both detector and readout electronics, is found to fulﬁl the requirements of the CEE.},

	abstract = {The FairRoot framework is an object oriented simulation, reconstruction and data analysis framework based on ROOT. It includes core services for detector simulation and oﬄine analysis. The framework delivers base classes which enable the users to easily construct their experimental setup in a fast and convenient way. By using the Virtual Monte Carlo concept it is possible to perform the simulations using either Geant3 or Geant4 without changing the user code or the geometry description. Using and extending the task mechanism of ROOT it is possible to implement complex analysis tasks in a convenient way. Moreover, using the FairCuda interface of the framework it is possible to run some of these tasks also on GPU. Data IO, as well as parameter handling and data base connections are also handled by the framework. Since some of the experiments will not have an experimental setup with a conventional trigger system, the framework can handle also free ﬂowing input streams of detector data. For this mode of operation the framework provides classes to create the needed time sorted input streams of detector data out of the event based simulation data . There are also tools to do radiation studies and to visualize the simulated data. A CMake-CDash based building and monitoring system is also part of the FairRoot services which helps to build and test the framework on many diﬀerent platforms in an automatic way, including also Continuous Integration.},
