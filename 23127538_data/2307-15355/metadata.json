  "abstract": "The impact parameter characterizes the centrality in nucleus-nucleus collision geometry. The determination of impact parameters in real experiments is usually based on the reconstructed particle attributes or the derived event-level observables. For the scheduled Cooler-storage-ring External-target Experiment (CEE), the low beam energy reduces correlation between the impact parameter and charged particle multiplicity, which decreases the validity of the explicit determination methods. This work investigates a few neural network-based models that directly take the digitized signals from the external Time-of-flight detectors as input. The model with the best performance shows a mean absolute error of 0.479 fm with simulated U-U collisions at 0.5 AGeV. The performances of the models implemented with digi inputs are compared with reference models with phase space inputs, showing the capability of neural networks to handle the original but potentially interrelated digitized signal information.",
