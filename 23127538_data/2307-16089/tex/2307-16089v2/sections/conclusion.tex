\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We proposed \manner{}, a modular framework for multi-aspect neural news recommendation. It learns aspect-specialized news encoders with supervised contrastive learning, and linearly combines the corresponding aspect-specific similarity scores for final ranking. \manner{}'s modular design allows defining ad-hoc multi-aspect ranking functions (i.e. diversification or personalization) at inference time. \manner{} can be seamlessly extended to new aspects, without the need to train dedicated models for changes in the recommendation objective. Our experiments show that \manner{} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NNRs on (i) standard content-based recommendation, as well as on single- and multi-aspect (ii) diversification and (iii) personalization of recommendations. Our detailed analyses show that, by weighing the importance of individual aspects, we can identify on-the-fly optimal trade-offs between content-based recommendation performance and aspect-based customization. Lastly, we show that, if equipped with a multilingual PLM, \manner{} can successfully cross-lingually transfer aspect-specific news encoders. This supports use cases where aspect-specific labels (e.g., sentiment) are not available for news in the target languages of interest. We hope that our work stimulates more research towards modular, easily extendable, and reusable news recommenders.
