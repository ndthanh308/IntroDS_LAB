\section{Datasets}
\label{sec:appendix_datasets}

We conduct our experiments on two public news recommendation datasets: MINDlarge (denoted MIND) \cite{wu2020mind} and Adressa-1 week (denoted Adressa) \cite{gulla2017adressa}. Since \citet{wu2020mind} do not release test labels for MIND, we use the provided validation portion for testing, and split the respective training set into temporally disjoint training (first four days of data) and validation portions (the last day). Following established practices on splitting the Adressa dataset \cite{hu2020graph,xu2023group}, we use the data of the first five days to construct user histories and the clicks of the sixth day to build the training dataset. We randomly sample 20\% of the last day's clicks to create the validation set, and treat the remaining samples of the last day as the test set.\footnote{Note that during validation and testing, we reconstruct user histories with all the samples of the first six days of data.} Since Adressa contains only positive samples (i.e., no data about users' seen but not clicked news), we randomly sample 20 news as negatives for each clicked article to build impressions following \citet{yi2021efficient}. Table \ref{tab:mind_dataset} summarizes the statistics of both datasets.

Regarding aspects, the topical category annotations are provided in both datasets. As no sentiment labels exist in neither MIND nor Adressa, we use a multilingual XLM-RoBERTa Base model \cite{conneau2020unsupervised} trained on tweets and fine-tuned for sentiment analysis \cite{barbieri2022xlm} to classify news into three classes: positive (pos), neutral, and negative (neg). We compute real-valued scores using the model's confidence scores $s_i$ for class $i$, and the predicted sentiment class label $\hat{l}$ as follows:
%
\begin{equation}
\small
    s_{sent}  \hspace{-0.2em} =  \hspace{-0.2em}
        \begin{cases}
            (+1) \times s_{pos} \text{, if } \hat{l} \hspace{-0.2em} =  \hspace{-0.2em} pos \\  
            (-1) \times s_{neg} \text{, if } \hat{l} \hspace{-0.2em} =  \hspace{-0.2em} neg \\  
            (1 - s_{neutral})  \hspace{-0.2em} \times \hspace{-0.2em} (s_{pos} - s_{neg}) \text{, otherwise} \\  
        \end{cases}
\end{equation}
