\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We proposed \manner{}, a modular framework for multi-aspect neural news recommendation. It learns aspect-specialized NEs with supervised contrastive learning, and linearly combines the corresponding aspect-specific similarity scores for final ranking. Its modular design allows defining ad-hoc multi-aspect ranking functions at inference.

Our experiments show that \manner{} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NNRs on both (i) standard content-based recommendation, and on single- and multi-aspect (ii) diversification and (iii) personalization of recommendations. Moreover, we can identify on-the-fly optimal trade-offs between content-based recommendation performance and aspect-based customization.

Equipped with a multilingual PLM, \manner{} can successfully cross-lingually transfer aspect-specific NEs. This supports use cases where aspect-specific labels (e.g., sentiment) are not available for news in the target languages of interest. We hope that our work stimulates more research towards modular, easily extendable, and reusable news recommenders.
