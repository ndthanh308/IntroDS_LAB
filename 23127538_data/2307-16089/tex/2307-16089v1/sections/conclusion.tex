\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have proposed \manner{}, a modular framework for multi-aspect neural news recommendation, in which we leverage metric-based contrastive learning to obtain aspect-specialized news encoders, and flexibly combine the corresponding aspect-specific similarity scores for final ranking. The modular design of \manner{} allows defining ad-hoc multi-aspect ranking functions (i.e. diversification or personalization) at inference time, and the seamless extension of the framework to support new aspects, without the need to train dedicated NNR models for changes in the recommendation objective. Our experiments show that \manner{} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NNRs on (i) standard content-based recommendation, as well as on single- and multi-aspect (ii) diversification and (iii) personalization of recommendations. At the same time, our detailed analyses show that, by weighing the importance of individual aspects, we can identify optimal trade-offs between content-based recommendation performance and aspect-based customization. Further, we show that, if equipped with a multilingual PLM, \manner{} can successfully cross-lingually transfer aspect-specific news encoders, supporting use cases where aspect-specific labels (e.g., sentiment) are not available for target-language data.
