\begin{abstract}
Recent neural news recommenders (NNR) extend content-based recommendation
by (1) aligning additional \textit{aspects} such as topic or sentiment between the candidate news and user history or (2) diversifying recommendations w.r.t. these aspects. This customization is achieved by ``hardcoding'' additional constraints into NNR's architecture and/or training objectives: any change in the desired recommendation behavior thus requires the model to be retrained with a modified objective, impeding wide adoption of multi-aspect news recommenders.  
In this work, we introduce \manner{}, a modular framework for flexible \textit{multi-aspect} (neural) news recommendation that supports ad-hoc customization over individual aspects at inference time.
%, avoiding expensive retraining of the entire NNR model. 
With metric-based learning at its core, \manner{} obtains aspect-specialized news encoders and then flexibly combines aspect-specific similarity scores for final ranking. Evaluation on two standard news recommendation benchmarks (one in English, one in Norwegian) shows that \manner{} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art NNRs on both standard content-based recommendation and single- and multi-aspect customization. Moreover, with \manner{} we can trivially scale the importance and find the optimal trade-off between content-based recommendation performance and aspect-based diversity of recommendations. Finally, we show that both \manner{}'s content-based recommendation and aspect customization are robust to domain- and language transfer.   
 %by scaling the importance of individual aspects, we can identify an optimal trade-off between content-based recommendation performance and aspect-based diversity of recommendations. Importantly, our cross-lingual experiments results reveal that \manner{} combining aspect-specific news encoders trained on a mixture of different source- and target-language datasets performs similarly to the model fully trained on the target-language dataset on both content-based recommendation and aspect customization.
