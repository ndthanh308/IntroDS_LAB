  "abstract": "A light breeze rising over calm water initiates an intricate chain of events that culminates in a centimeters-deep turbulent shear layer capped by gravity-capillary ripples. At first, viscous stress accelerates a laminar wind-drift layer until small surface ripples appear. Then a second \"wave-catalyzed\" instability grows in the wind-drift layer, before sharpening into along-wind jets and downwelling plumes, and finally devolving into three-dimensional turbulence. This paper elucidates the evolution of wind-drift layers after ripple inception using wave-averaged numerical simulations with a random initial condition and a constant-amplitude representation of the incipient surface ripples. Our model reproduces qualitative aspects of laboratory measurements similar those reported by Veron & Melville (2001), validating the wave-averaged approach. But we also find that our results are disturbingly sensitive to the amplitude of the prescribed surface wave field, raising the question whether wave-averaged models are truly \"predictive\" if they do not also describe the evolution of the coupled evolution of the surface waves together with the flow beneath.",
