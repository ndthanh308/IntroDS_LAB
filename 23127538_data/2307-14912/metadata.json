  "abstract": "Fanfiction, a popular form of creative writing set within established fictional universes, has gained a substantial online following. However, ensuring the well-being and safety of participants has become a critical concern in this community. The detection of triggering content, material that may cause emotional distress or trauma to readers, poses a significant challenge. In this paper, we describe our approach for the Trigger Detection shared task at PAN CLEF 2023, where we want to detect multiple triggering content in a given Fanfiction document. For this, we build a hierarchical model that uses recurrence over Transformer-based language models. In our approach, we first split long documents into smaller sized segments and use them to fine-tune a Transformer model. Then, we extract feature embeddings from the fine-tuned Transformer model, which are used as input in the training of multiple LSTM models for trigger detection in a multi-label setting. Our model achieves an F1-macro score of 0.372 and F1-micro score of 0.736 on the validation set, which are higher than the baseline results shared at PAN CLEF 2023.",
