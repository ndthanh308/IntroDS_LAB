  "abstract": "We present a JWST/MRS spectrum of the quasar J1120+0641 at z=7.0848, the first spectroscopic observation of a reionisation-era quasar in the rest-frame infrared ($0.6<λ<3.4μ$m). In the context of the mysterious fast assembly of the first supermassive black holes at z>7, our observations enable for the first time the detection of hot torus dust, the H$α$ emission line, and the Paschen-series broad emission lines in a quasar at z>7. Hot torus dust is clearly detected as an upturn in the continuum emission at $λ_{\\text{rest}}\\simeq1.3μ$m, leading to a black-body temperature of $T=1413.5^{+5.7}_{-7.4}$K. Compared to similarly-luminous quasars at 0<z<6, the hot dust in J1120+0641 is somewhat elevated in temperature (top 1%). The temperature is more typical among 6<z<6.5 quasars (top 25%), leading us to postulate a weak evolution in the hot dust temperature at z>6 ($2σ$ significance). We measure the black hole mass of J1120+0641 based on the H$α$ Balmer line, $M_{\\text{BH}}=1.52\\pm0.17\\cdot 10^9 M_\\odot$, which is in good agreement with the previous rest-UV MgII black hole mass measurement. The black hole mass based on the Paschen-series lines is also consistent, indicating no significant extinction in the rest-frame UV measurement. The broad H$α$, Pa-$α$ and Pa-$β$ emission lines are consistent with an origin in a common broad-line region (BLR) with density log$N_H/\\text{cm}^{-3}\\geq 12$, ionisation parameter $-7<$log$U<-4$, and extinction E(B-V)$\\lesssim 0.1$mag. These BLR parameters are consistent with similarly-bright quasars at 0<z<4. Overall, we find that both J1120+0641's hot dust torus and hydrogen BLR properties show no significant peculiarity when compared to luminous quasars down to z=0. The quasar accretion structures must have therefore assembled very quickly, as they appear fully \"mature\" less than 760 million years after the Big Bang.",
