  "abstract": "Numerous distributed applications, such as cloud computing and distributed ledgers, necessitate the system to invoke asynchronous consensus objects an unbounded number of times, where the completion of one consensus instance is followed by the invocation of another. With only a constant number of objects available, object reuse becomes vital.\n  We investigate the challenge of object recycling in the presence of Byzantine processes, which can deviate from the algorithm code in any manner. Our solution must also be self-stabilizing, as it is a powerful notion of fault tolerance. Self-stabilizing systems can recover automatically after the occurrence of arbitrary transient faults, in addition to tolerating communication and (Byzantine or crash) process failures, provided the algorithm code remains intact.\n  We provide a recycling mechanism for asynchronous objects that enables their reuse once their task has ended, and all non-faulty processes have retrieved the decided values. This mechanism relies on synchrony assumptions and builds on a new self-stabilizing Byzantine-tolerant synchronous multivalued consensus algorithm, along with a novel composition of existing techniques.",
