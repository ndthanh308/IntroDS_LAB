  "abstract": "We present the preliminary timing analysis of confirmed intermediate polar UU Col and possible intermediate polar Swift J0939.7-3224 in the optical band with the help of long-term, high-cadence continuous photometry from Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). For UU Col, we revise previously reported orbital and spin periods as 3.464 $\\pm$ 0.005 h and 863.74 $\\pm$ 0.08 s, respectively. Using the second harmonic of the beat frequency, the beat period is estimated as $\\sim$928 s. These findings indicate that UU Col is a disc-fed dominated disc-overflow accretor. For J0939, we establish the spin period as 2671.8 $\\pm$ 0.8 s and refine the provisionally suggested orbital period as 8.49 $\\pm$ 0.03 h. The absence of beat frequency in J0939 signifies that it might be a pure disc-fed accretor; however, an X-ray study of this source will help to understand its true nature.",
