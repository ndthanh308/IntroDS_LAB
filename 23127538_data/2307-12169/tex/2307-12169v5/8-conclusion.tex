\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we examine and analyze the traffic pattern of LLM training with hybrid parallelism. We propose a novel \textit{Rail-only architecture} that aligns with LLMs' distinct characteristics and demands. Our architecture leads to 38\% to 77\% cost reductions and 37\% to 75\% power savings while maintaining identical performance to the state-of-the-art GPU networks.
