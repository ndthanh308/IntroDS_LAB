%%%%%%%% mlsys 2024 EXAMPLE LATEX SUBMISSION FILE %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\documentclass{article}

% Recommended, but optional, packages for figures and better typesetting:
\usepackage{microtype}
\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{subfigure}
\usepackage{booktabs} % for professional tables

% hyperref makes hyperlinks in the resulting PDF.
% If your build breaks (sometimes temporarily if a hyperlink spans a page)
% please comment out the following usepackage line and replace
% \usepackage{mlsys2024} with \usepackage[nohyperref]{mlsys2024} above.
\usepackage{hyperref}

% Attempt to make hyperref and algorithmic work together better:
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

% Use the following line for the initial blind version submitted for review:
\usepackage[accepted]{mlsys2024}
\input{command}

% If accepted, instead use the following line for the camera-ready submission:
% \usepackage[accepted]{mlsys2024}

% The \mlsystitle you define below is probably too long as a header.
% Therefore, a short form for the running title is supplied here:
\mlsystitlerunning{Submission and Formatting Instructions for MLSys 2024}
% \renewcommand{\vspace}[1]{\null}

% It is OKAY to include author information, even for blind
% submissions: the style file will automatically remove it for you
% unless you've provided the [accepted] option to the mlsys2024
% package.

% List of affiliations: The first argument should be a (short)
% identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country

% You can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order.
% Ideally, you should not use this facility. Affiliations will be numbered
% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.

% This document was modified from the file originally made available by
% Pat Langley and Andrea Danyluk for ICML-2K. This version was created
% by Iain Murray in 2018. It was modified from a version from Dan Roy in
% 2017, which was based on a version from Lise Getoor and Tobias
% Scheffer, which was slightly modified from the 2010 version by
% Thorsten Joachims & Johannes Fuernkranz, slightly modified from the
% 2009 version by Kiri Wagstaff and Sam Roweis's 2008 version, which is
% slightly modified from Prasad Tadepalli's 2007 version which is a
% lightly changed version of the previous year's version by Andrew
% Moore, which was in turn edited from those of Kristian Kersting and
% Codrina Lauth. Alex Smola contributed to the algorithmic style files.
