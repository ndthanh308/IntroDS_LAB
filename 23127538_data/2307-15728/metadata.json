  "abstract": "We present a device architecture of hybrid-edge and dual-gated quantum point contact. We demonstrate improved electrostatic control over the separation, position, and coupling of each broken-symmetry compressible strip in graphene. Via low-temperature magneto-transport measurement, we demonstrate selective manipulation over the evolution, hybridization, and transmission of arbitrarily chosen quantum Hall states in the channel. With gate-tunable tunneling spectroscopy, we characterize the energy gap of each symmetry-broken quantum Hall state with high resolution on the order of ~0.1 meV.",
