\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:concl}

We have successfully developed and deployed an innovative system named \systemname, consisting of a data-driven dashboard and a mobile web application, to encourage sustainable practices among our campus community. In a real-life scenario, our system played a central role in a highly successful two-week food waste reduction campaign, which attracted more than 200 participants. After the campaign concluded, we gathered feedback from 53 users, and the results emphasized the effectiveness of both the system and the campaign in raising awareness about food waste issues and cultivating food-saving habits among the respondents. Meanwhile, the user feedback highlighted valuable areas for improvement and offered crucial insights that will guide the enhancement of our system in future iterations.

In our ongoing pursuit of fostering sustainable habits, we recognize the significance of continuously iterating and adapting our system to meet the evolving needs of our users and address environmental challenges. Furthermore, we acknowledge the importance of integrating the system into broader policy-level interventions to sustain long-term food-saving behavior and have a more substantial impact on the campus community. We hope that our efforts will resonate beyond our campus, inspiring other communities to adopt similar initiatives and contribute to the global goal of sustainability.
