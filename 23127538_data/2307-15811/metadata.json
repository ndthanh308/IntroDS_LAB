  "abstract": "We are concerned with the existence of blowing-up solutions to the following boundary value problem $$-Δu= λV(x) e^u-4πN δ_0\\;\\mbox{ in } B_1,\\quad u=0 \\;\\mbox{ on }\\partial B_1,$$ where $B_1$ is the unit ball in $\\mathbb R^2$ centered at the origin, $V(x)$ is a positive smooth potential, $N$ is a positive integer ($N\\geq 1$). Here $δ_0$ defines the Dirac measure with pole at $0$, and $λ>0$ is a small parameter. We assume that $N=1$ and, under some suitable assumptions on the derivatives of the potential $V$ at $0$, we find a solution which exhibits a non-simple blow-up profile as $λ\\to 0^+$.",
