  "abstract": "We derive equations of motion for dissipative spin hydrodynamics from kinetic theory up to first order in a gradient expansion. Choosing a specific form of the matching conditions, relating the change in the spin potential to the spin diffusion and spin energy, we then show that the equations of motion, linearized around homogeneous global equilibrium, are causal and stable in any Lorentz frame, if certain sufficient conditions on the transport coefficients are fulfilled.",
