This paper focuses on the screener's search behavior given an ISO.
%
The creation of the ISO itself can be modeled as a fair set selection or, if order matters, fair ranking problem \cite{Zehlike2023_FairRanking_P1, Zehlike2023_FairRanking_P2, DBLP:journals/vldb/PitouraSK22} in which the goal is to learn a fair ISO from data using, e.g., probability-based \cite{DBLP:conf/ssdbm/YangS17, DBLP:conf/cikm/ZehlikeB0HMB17} and exposure-based \cite{DBLP:journals/cacm/Baeza-Yates18, DBLP:journals/sigir/JoachimsGPHG17} methods.
Similarly, other works, e.g., \cite{DBLP:conf/wsdm/KokkodisPI15, DBLP:conf/kdd/Kokkodis18, Hadass_2004_TheEffectInternetRecruiting} study how IAS, like online job markets, enable the creation of candidate pools and, in turn, the ISO.
%
Instead, motivated by our experience at G, we are interested in how a screener, particularly a human one, searches the ISO.
With some exceptions \cite{DBLP:conf/chi/EchterhoffYM22, PeiEAAMO2023, Ovaisi_10.1145/3652864, DBLP:conf/wsdm/WangGBMN18},
most fairness works avoid studying the user of the ISO, e.g., treating position bias as a technical bias.
%
Our screener-centric approach is similar to web search click models that were the first to formalize \cite{CraswellZTR08_ExperimentsClickPositionBias} and test \cite{DBLP:journals/jcmc/PanHJLGG07, DBLP:conf/clef/GrotovCMSXR15, DBLP:conf/www/RichardsonDR07} how users search over an ISO.
Different from these works, we consider a user that ``clicks'' on more than one item, and formalize such user under a utility-maximizing framework with fairness constraints, relating the insights from these works to candidate screening as well as to fair set selection works \cite{stoyanovich2018online}.

The works on click models provide empirical evidence for the position bias, though precede the fairness literature.
Two recent works provide empirical evidence for position bias in candidate screening due the ISO with a focus on individual fairness \cite{DBLP:conf/innovations/DworkHPRZ12}.
%
\citet{DBLP:conf/chi/EchterhoffYM22} collaborate with a college to study anchoring bias \cite{tversky_judgment_1974} in admissions officers. 
They find that the same applicant is better off if it is preceded by worst rather than better applicants, and propose an algorithm to balance out the anchoring bias when presenting applications to the admissions officer.
%
\citet{PeiEAAMO2023} also collaborate with a college to study how the platform used by professors for evaluating homeworks affects student grades. 
They run experiments varying the order in which the homeworks are presented by the platform, and show that the default alphabetical order unfairly rewards students with the same work quality due to their last names.
%
We differ from these works by defining the ISO as a parameter in the problem formulation and using simulations flexible enough to capture these and other screening scenarios.
% Other recent works like \citet{Ovaisi_10.1145/3652864} study explicitly position bias and propose a post-processing technique to account for its potential unfairness. We also differ from this work by defining the ISO as a parameter of interest as well as by modeling the user.

Our best-$k$ and good-$k$ formulations (Section~\ref{sec:ProblemFormulation.Objectives}) belong to the fair set selection literature \cite{DBLP:conf/eaamo/BueningSBGD22}. 
The reference problem is the secretary problem (SP) \cite{ferguson1989solved} where we select a candidate in a randomly ordered sequence committing to the acceptance or rejection decision after each evaluation.
% \footnote{When order matters, the reference problem is the top-$k$ selection \cite{fagin2001optimal}.}
The past literature has already analyzed the fairness implication of the SP, even in the $k$-choice extension \cite{stoyanovich2018online}.
However, our best-$k$ and good-$k$ formulations, differently from the SP, focus on the screening process, not the interview phase. 
We assume an offline set selection, meaning each candidate is individually evaluated by the screener and each decision is irrevocable. 
Such setting emphasizes the ISO's role.
Past works on the SP online setting assume the additive utility we employ in the best-$k$ formulation \cite{stoyanovich2018online, mehrotra2021mitigating}.
This fact shows how peculiar our good-$k$ formulation is relative to previously analyzed settings.
