\label{sec:Introduction}

Candidate screening is a complex, human-dependent task. 
It consists of a decision-maker or user, which we refer to as the \textit{screener}, tasked with selecting $k$ candidates from a candidate pool. 
Common candidate screening processes include the evaluation of resumes for a job interview \cite{Pisanelli2022_YourCV} or application packages for college admission \cite{SukumarMH18_PeacanPie}. 
The screener usually evaluates the candidate pool using limited information and under strict time constraints.
Information access systems (IAS), such as online platforms like LinkedIn and database queries like Taleo, play a central role today in candidate screening by allowing screeners to search more efficiently the candidate pool.
Enabled by machine learning (ML) \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2307-03195}, IAS often present candidates according to an estimated relevance or, at least, according to a relevant characteristic chosen by the screener \cite{DBLP:books/aw/Baeza-YatesR99}.
An industry around algorithmic candidate screening has emerged in recent years \cite{DBLP:journals/air/WillKL23}, though poor fairness results \cite{DBLP:conf/fat/WilsonG0MBSTP21,Wehner20,Sonderling22,Raghavan2020AlgortihmicHiring,DBLP:journals/datamine/RheaMDSSSKS22,jintelligence9030046,DBLP:journals/patterns/SloaneMC22, Fabris2023_DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2309-13933} and calls to consider the behavior of the human user \cite{Carricco2018EUHumanCentred, DBLP:conf/aaai/Ruggieri0PST23, bringas2022fairness, DBLP:journals/ethicsit/AlvarezCEFFFGMPLRSSZR24} continue to drive research on the social impact of IAS.

In this paper, we investigate the role of the \textit{initial screening order} (ISO) on the set selection problem implicit in the task of candidate screening. 
The ISO refers to the order in which the candidates appear in the candidate pool.
It can be chosen by or provided to the screener enabled via an IAS \cite{DBLP:journals/ftir/Ekstrand0B022}.
We develop a utility-based framework to understand the search behavior of the screener when going over the ISO, and use it to implement extensive simulations that study the influence of the ISO.
We find that the ISO can impact the optimality (i.e., choosing the best candidates) and fairness (i.e., treating similar candidates similarly) of the selected $k$ candidates, especially when the screener is human.
This is mainly because of the \textit{position bias} inherent to the ISO.
Here, position bias refers to the penalty (or premium) a candidate experiences due to where it falls on the ISO, as humans are predisposed to favor the items placed at the top of a list \cite{DBLP:journals/cacm/Baeza-Yates18, 10.1093/qje/qjr028}.

We motivate the ISO problem further in Section \ref{sec:Generali} based on our collaboration with an European company.
In Section~\ref{sec:ProblemFormulation}, we describe how the screener searches the ISO for an optimal and fair set of $k$ candidates w.r.t. a representational quota $q$ of protected candidates.
We define two problem formulations. 
In the best-$k$ the screener selects the $k$ top candidates, whereas in the good-$k$ the screener selects the $k$ first good-enough candidates fitting some minimum candidate quality measure.
We devise algorithmic solutions for both problems.
The good-$k$ is noteworthy as it allows the screener to partially search the candidate pool; the set selection problem formulation often assumes a full search.
%
In Section~\ref{sec:HumanScreener}, we analyze the algorithmic and human-like screeners to understand the impact of the ISO when a human is involved. 
The former refers to a consistent screener; the latter refers to an inconsistent screener whose evaluation of candidates suffers over time due to the fatigue of performing a repetitive task.
%
In Section~\ref{sec:Experiments}, we enhance our analysis of these two screeners through simulations that mimic multiple screening settings.
Our results confirm the role of position bias inherent to the ISO and raise new fairness concerns.
For instance, we find that the human-like screener violates individual fairness by not evaluating similar candidates similarly \cite{DBLP:conf/innovations/DworkHPRZ12} while still meeting the quota $q$, and that the algorithmic screener misses the best candidate depending on its search procedure.
%
In Section~\ref{sec:Discussion}, we conclude by discussing the limitations and extensions of our work.\footnote{We provide additional material in the Appendix.}

Our work is the first to formalize the ISO problem.
Our main contributions are threefold.
\textit{First}, we formalize the role of the ISO in two search behaviors of the screener with the best-$k$ and good-$k$ problems.
\textit{Second}, we introduce a human-like screener and compare it theoretically and experimentally to its algorithmic counterpart.
\textit{Third}, we provide a flexible simulation tool for studying the ISO problem able to inform practitioners without needing to run real-world screening scenarios.
