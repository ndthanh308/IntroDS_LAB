\begin{abstract}
    We investigate the role of the initial screening order (ISO) in candidate screening. The ISO refers to the order in which the screener searches the candidate pool when selecting $k$ candidates. Today, it is common for the ISO to be the product of an information access system, such as an online platform or a database query. The ISO has been largely overlooked in the literature, despite its impact on the optimality and fairness of the selected $k$ candidates, especially under a human screener. We define two problem formulations describing the search behavior of the screener given an ISO: the best-$k$, where it selects the top $k$ candidates; and the good-$k$, where it selects the first good-enough $k$ candidates. To study the impact of the ISO, we introduce a human-like screener and compare it to its algorithmic counterpart, where the human-like screener is conceived to be inconsistent over time. Our analysis, in particular, shows that the ISO, under a human-like screener solving for the good-$k$ problem, hinders individual fairness despite meeting group fairness, and hampers the optimality of the selected $k$ candidates. This is due to position bias, where a candidate's evaluation is affected by its position within the ISO. We report extensive simulated experiments exploring the parameters of the best-$k$ and good-$k$ problems for both screeners. Our simulation framework is flexible enough to account for multiple candidate screening tasks, being an alternative to running real-world procedures.

\section*{Ethical Considerations}
We did not face ethical challenges when drafting the paper. Results are based on simulated data intended to illustrate our theoretical analysis. During our collaboration with company G, in particular, which occurred before the drafting of this paper, we followed G's ethical guidelines at all times. We concluded our collaboration with G with an internal report that we presented and discussed with all stakeholders. No sensitive data (or data at all) from company G was used for this work. At no point did we receive monetary compensation from G. The views reflected are entirely our own. Further, we believe that this work shows the importance of considering the human user in the formulation of the candidate screening problem. We stress that our distinction between an algorithmic screener and a human-like screener is to show the importance of considering the latter kind and not to endorse the former kind. We strongly believe that candidate screening is a complex, human-dependent and human-centered process that should not be left as an automated decision-making problem.
