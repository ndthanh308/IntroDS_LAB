This work borrows from a previous collaborative effort at a European Fortune Global 500.
We refer to this company as G.
The purpose was to study G's hiring process as an algorithmic fairness problem.
We worked closely with 
% Advanced Analytics (AA) and ISO
Human Resources (HR), focusing on candidate screening.
In this phase of G's hiring process, an HR officer reduces the candidate pool for a job opening into a smaller pool of suitable candidates based on each candidate's profile.
The candidate pool was stored in Oracle's Taleo,
% \footnote{Visit \url{https://www.oracle.com/human-capital-management/taleo/}.} 
a hiring platform used by HR officers to, among other things, obtain the ISO.
For more details on our collaboration, see Appendix~\ref{Appendix.MoreOnG}.

The following \textit{five stylized facts} summarize key practices by the HR officers (henceforth, screeners) that motivated the ISO problem.
%
% \begin{itemize}
    % \item[G1] 
    \textit{\textbf{G1}} \textit{Varying ISOs.} 
    Screeners chose the ISO. The choice was restricted by the sorting fields of the hiring platform, such as using the candidates' last name. 
    %
    % \item[G2] 
    \textit{\textbf{G2}} \textit{Two ways to search the candidate pool.} 
    % Screeners chose how to search the ISO.
    Two search practices became apparent: full or partial search of the candidate pool.
    % based on the desired number of suitable candidates. 
    %
    % \item[G3] 
    \textit{\textbf{G3}} \textit{Meeting the set of minimum basic requirements.} 
    Screeners were able to differentiate candidates relative to each other, but their focus was on finding candidates that met these requirements. 
    Order within the selected $k$ candidates was not necessarily important.
    %
    % \item[G4] 
    \textit{\textbf{G4}} \textit{Diverse suitable candidates.}
    % G already had in place 
    Fairness goals already existed in the form of representation quotas, often around gender, that were enforced by the screeners. 
    % This meant screeners prioritized suitable candidates from the protected group when selecting candidates. 
    %
    % \item[G5] 
    \textit{\textbf{G5}} \textit{A consistent notion of time.}
    % Given the amount of information to be processed for each candidate, 
    Screeners aimed at spending one minute per candidate.
% \end{itemize}

Although G1-5 are specific to G, they highlight salient aspects of real-world candidate screening problems likely to hold in similar settings involving humans searching a pool of candidates (see, e.g., \cite{DBLP:journals/jcmc/PanHJLGG07, DBLP:conf/clef/GrotovCMSXR15, DBLP:conf/www/RichardsonDR07, DBLP:conf/chi/EchterhoffYM22, PeiEAAMO2023}).
G4-5 are standard to the fair set selection problem, especially under an algorithmic screener, while G1-3 introduce new considerations to such problem formulation, especially under a human screener.
We come back to G1-5 in Sections \ref{sec:ProblemFormulation} and \ref{sec:HumanScreener}.
