\begin{abstract}
    We investigate the role of the initial screening order (ISO) in candidate screening tasks, such as employee hiring and academic admissions, in which a screener is tasked with selecting $k$ candidates from a candidate pool. The ISO refers to the order in which the screener searches the candidate pool. Today, it is common for the ISO to be the product of an information access system, such as an online platform or a database query. The ISO has been largely overlooked in the literature, despite its potential impact on the optimality and fairness of the chosen $k$ candidates, especially under a human screener. We define two problem formulations describing the search behavior of the screener under the ISO: the best-$k$, where the screener selects the $k$ best candidates; and the good-$k$, where the screener selects the $k$ first good-enough candidates. To study the impact of the ISO, we introduce a human-like screener and compare it to its algorithmic counterpart, where the human-like screener is conceived to be inconsistent over time due to fatigue. In particular, our analysis shows that the ISO, under a human-like screener solving for the good-$k$ problem, hinders individual fairness despite meeting group level fairness, and hampers the optimality of the selected $k$ candidates. This is due to position bias, where a candidate's evaluation is affected by its position within the ISO. We report extensive simulated experiments exploring the parameters of the best-$k$ and good-$k$ problems for the algorithmic and human-like screeners. The simulation framework is flexible enough to account for multiple screening settings, being an alternative to running real-world candidate screening procedures. This work is motivated by a real-world candidate screening problem studied in collaboration with an European company.

\section*{Ethical Considerations}

% \paragraph{Ethical considerations}
% 1) a description of the ethical concerns the authors mitigated while conducting the work (as part of an ethical considerations statement)
We did not face any ethical challenges when drafting the paper.  
Results are based on simulated data intended to illustrate our theoretical analysis. During our collaboration with company G, in particular, which occurred before the drafting of this paper, we followed G's ethical guidelines at all times. We concluded our collaboration with G with an internal report that we presented and discussed with all stakeholders. No sensitive data (or data at all) from company G was used for this work. At no point did we receive monetary compensation from G. Our research has been funded by public institutions. The views reflected are entirely our own.

% \paragraph{Researcher positionality}
% % 2) reflections on how their background and experiences inform or shape the work (as part of a researcher positionality statement)
% The authors come from a mixed of backgrounds, both personal and academic. To ensure anonymity, we do not disclose here further information about the authors, but we are committed to provide the necessary details if this submission is successful. We will provide a positionality statement per author. 

% \paragraph{Adverse impact}
% % 3) reflection on the adverse, unintended impact the work might have once published (as part of an adverse impact statement)
We believe that this work shows the importance of considering the human user in the formulation of the candidate screening problem. We want to stress that our distinction between an algorithmic screener and a human-like screener was to show the importance of considering the latter kind and not to endorse the former kind. We strongly believe that candidate screening is a complex, human-dependent and human-centered process that should not be left as an automated decision-making problem.
