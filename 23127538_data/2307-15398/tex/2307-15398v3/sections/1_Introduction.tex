\label{sec:Introduction}

Candidate screening is a complex, human-dependent process. 
It consists of a decision-maker, which we refer to as the \textit{screener}, tasked with choosing $k$ suitable candidates from a candidate pool. 
Common candidate screening processes include the evaluation of resumes for a job interview \cite{Pisanelli2022_YourCV} or application packages for university admission \cite{SukumarMH18_PeacanPie}. 
The screener usually evaluates the candidate pool using limited information and under strict time constraints. 
Because of this, as with other repetitive tasks performed by humans \cite{Kahneman2011Thinking, Kahneman2021Noise}, candidate screening is prone to biased decision-making \cite{Pisanelli2022_YourCV, DBLP:conf/chi/EchterhoffYM22}. 
An industry around automating candidate screening using Machine Learning (ML) has emerged in recent years \cite{DBLP:journals/air/WillKL23},
though with limited results in terms of fairness \cite{DBLP:conf/fat/WilsonG0MBSTP21,Wehner20,Sonderling22,Raghavan2020AlgortihmicHiring,DBLP:journals/datamine/RheaMDSSSKS22,jintelligence9030046,DBLP:journals/patterns/SloaneMC22, Fabris2023_DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2309-13933}. 
The future of automated decision-making (ADM) for candidate screening is an open question as ADM systems for this task are increasingly required by stakeholders, 
such as regulators, 
to consider how humans interact with their output \cite{Carricco2018EUHumanCentred, DBLP:conf/aaai/Ruggieri0PST23}. 

In this paper, we investigate the role of the \textit{initial screening order} (ISO) in the fair set selection problem within candidate screening. 
The ISO refers to the order in which the candidates appear in the candidate pool.
It can be chosen by 
% (like sorting candidates by their last name) 
or provided to 
% (like using the ranking of candidates from a search engine) 
the screener.
We find that the ISO has an impact in terms of optimality (choosing the best candidates) and fairness (treating similar candidates similarly) on the selected set of candidates by the screener,
especially when the screener is human (e.g., \cite{PeiEAAMO2023, DBLP:conf/chi/EchterhoffYM22}).
This is mainly because of the \textit{position bias} inherent to the ISO.
Position bias refers to the penalty (or premium) each candidate experiences due to where it falls on the ISO \cite{DBLP:journals/cacm/Baeza-Yates18}.
Humans are predisposed to favor the items being placed at the top of a list as we tend to read from top to bottom \cite{DBLP:journals/cacm/Baeza-Yates18, 10.1093/qje/qjr028}.
% The ISO determines when the screener comes across a specific candidate;
Clearly, there is a benefit for those candidates that appear at the start of the ISO.
We further motivate the ISO problem in Section \ref{sec:Generali}.

Our results are based on a modeling framework for understanding how a screener interacts with an ISO along with a simulations framework that implements extensively the problem formulations for practical insights on the influence of the ISO.
We start with Section~\ref{sec:ProblemFormulation},
in which we describe how a screener explores the ISO in search of an optimal and fair (at the group-level w.r.t. a representational quota $q$) set of $k$ candidates.
We define two problem formulations.
In the best-$k$ the screener selects the $k$ top candidates, while
in the good-$k$ the screener selects the $k$ first good-enough candidates w.r.t. some minimum score for measuring candidate quality.
We devise algorithmic solutions for both problem formulations.
The good-$k$ is noteworthy as it allows the screener to partially search the candidate pool;
set selection problem formulations often assume a full search by the screener.
We discuss this further in Sections \ref{sec:RelatedWork} and \ref{sec:Add_RelatedWork}.
% To the best of our knowledge, this paper provides the first formalization for the good-$k$.

To better understand the impact of the ISO when a human screener is involved, 
in Section~\ref{sec:HumanScreener} we introduce and analyse the algorithmic and human-like screeners. 
The former refers to a consistent screener (like a ML model);
the latter refers to an inconsistent screener (like a human) whose evaluation of candidates suffers over time due to fatigue (see, e.g., \citet{Kahneman2011Thinking}).
We enhance our analysis of these two screeners in Section~\ref{sec:Experiments} through simulated experiments that mimic multiple screening settings and help us understand the impact of the ISO.
The results, although specific to our assumptions, confirm the role of position bias inherent to the ISO.
We find, for instance, that the human-like screener can violate individual fairness \cite{DBLP:conf/innovations/DworkHPRZ12} by not evaluating similar candidates similarly while still meeting $q$. 
We also find that the algorithmic screener can miss the best candidate depending on its search procedure.
In short, we find that where a candidate falls within the ISO can determine its chances of getting selected,
highlighting the influence of position bias.
We conclude in Section~\ref{sec:Discussion} by discussing the limitations of our work, future work, and key takeaways.
% Importantly, we argue that our simulations framework, which is open source, represents a tool for studying screening processes under the ISO.
% The code in-itself is a valuable contribution considering how difficult it can be to run real world screening seeings (see, e.g., \cite{PeiEAAMO2023, DBLP:conf/chi/EchterhoffYM22}). 

Our main contributions are threefold.
First, 
% we provide insights from a real-world candidate screening problem, summarized as stylized facts, that are important to the fair set selection literature.
% Second, 
we formalize the role of the ISO in two possible objectives of the screener with the best-$k$ and good-$k$ problems. 
% With the good-$k$ we also introduce a screener that can search partially the candidate pool.
% In particular, we point out that for good-$k$ the optimality can be reached by a partial search of the candidate pool
%
Second, we formulate a human-like screener and compare it to its algorithmic counterpart both theoretically and with experiments.
%
Third, with the simulations framework, we provide a useful, open source tool for studying the ISO problem and inform stakeholders without needing to run real world screening scenarios, which can be both costly and time consuming.
