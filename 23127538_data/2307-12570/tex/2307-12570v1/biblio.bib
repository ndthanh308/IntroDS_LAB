	Abstract = {Behavior of particles, drops and bubbles in two phase liquid?liquid systems is important in many fields of chemical and metallurgical engineering. This work examines the behavior of a rigid sphere in the vicinity of a liquid?liquid interface.
A rigid sphere approaching the liquid?liquid interface may either attain an equilibrium at the interface or may pass through it, depending on forces acting on the sphere. A geometrical model is developed for the sphere resting at an interface. Mathematical analysis employing this model successfully predicts the angle subtended with the axis of symmetry by the interface in contact with the sphere. It is also predicts height zc of the plane interface above the uniform film thickness zone and a critical radius (Rcrit, below which no sphere would pass through the interface. The solution is presented in algebraic and graphical forms. Predictions are verified experimentally.
Photographic observations of the gravity fall of rigid spheres in two phase liquid?liquid systems reveal that the sphere carry a column of the upper phase liquid while passing through the interface Acceleration of the sphere oversome distance is followed by the rupture of this column of liquid. The sphere, still enveloped in a layer of the upper liquid, ultimately attains an almost constant velocity. This entire phenomenon is illustrared by graphs and photographs.},

	Abstract = { ABSTRACT The numerical results obtained by Mougin &amp; Magnaudet (Phys. Rev. Lett. vol. 88, 2002a, 14502) for the flow past a freely moving spheroidal bubble with a prescribed spheroidal shape are processed to analyse the evolution of the forces and torques experienced by the bubble when it rises along a planar zigzag and a circular helix. It is found that, as soon as the wake becomes three-dimensional, a lateral force with a strength comparable with that of the buoyancy force occurs. This force, together with the corresponding torque, drives the horizontal movements of the bubble. The force and torque balances reveal how these wake-induced effects are balanced by added-mass effects to make possible the existence of zigzag and helical motions along which the angle between the velocity and the symmetry axis of the bubble remains small. The evolution of the wake during the zigzag indicates that the sign of the trailing vortices, and thus that of the wake-induced force and torque, is governed by the rotation of the bubble and reveals the sensitivity of the wake dynamics to the changes in the bubble velocity and rotation rate. },

The boundary representation now includes the muscular heart wall. The fixed topology of the boundary representation is exploited in the solution of the nonlinear equations which implicitly define the boundary forces. An improved numerical representation of the δ-function is introduced. A fast Laplace-solver is used. The results of calculations with a natural valve and with a prosthetic valve are presented.},

@article{uhlmann2005,
	Abstract = {We present an improved method for computing incompressible viscous flow around suspended rigid particles using a fixed and uniform computational grid. The main idea is to incorporate Peskin's regularized delta function approach [Acta Numerica 11 (2002) 1] into a direct formulation of the fluid--solid interaction force in order to allow for a smooth transfer between Eulerian and Lagrangian representations while at the same time avoiding strong restrictions of the time step. This technique was implemented in a finite-difference and fractional-step context. A variety of two- and three-dimensional simulations are presented, ranging from the flow around a single cylinder to the sedimentation of 1000 spherical particles. The accuracy and efficiency of the current method are clearly demonstrated.},
