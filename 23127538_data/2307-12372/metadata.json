  "abstract": "Recently a novel surface pair-density-wave (PDW) superconducting state has been discovered in Refs. [Phys. Rev. Lett. \\textbf{122}, 165302 (2019)] and Phys. Rev. B \\textbf{101}, 054506 (2020)], which may go through a distinct multiple phase transition (MPT) when the superconductivity fades away from bulk to the boundary (e.g. edges and corners). Based on the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations for the attractive tight-binding Hubbard modal in a one-dimensional chain, we demonstrate that the surface PDW state has a non-gapless quasiparticle spectrum, which is contrary to the conventional surface superconducting state. Moreover, we find that the MPT is associated with a zero-bias fast oscillating pattern in the LDOS near the surface. Our findings provide a potential experimental clue to identify the surface PDW state.",
