	abstract = {As the temperature of a cooling object decreases as it relaxes to thermal equilibrium, it is intuitively assumed that a hot object should take longer to cool than a warm one. Yet, some 2,300 years ago, Aristotle observed that “to cool hot water quickly, begin by putting it in the sun”1,2. In the 1960s, this counterintuitive phenomenon was rediscovered as the statement that “hot water can freeze faster than cold water” and has become known as the Mpemba effect3; it has since been the subject of much experimental investigation4–8 and some controversy8,9. Although many specific mechanisms have been proposed6,7,10–16, no general consensus exists as to the underlying cause. Here we demonstrate the Mpemba effect in a controlled setting—the thermal quench of a colloidal system immersed in water, which serves as a heat bath. Our results are reproducible and agree quantitatively with calculations based on a recently proposed theoretical framework17. By carefully choosing parameters, we observe cooling that is exponentially faster than that observed using typical parameters, in accord with the recently predicted strong Mpemba effect18. Our experiments outline the generic conditions needed to accelerate heat removal and relaxation to thermal equilibrium and support the idea that the Mpemba effect is not simply a scientific curiosity concerning how water freezes into ice—one of the many anomalous features of water19—but rather the prototype for a wide range of anomalous relaxation phenomena of broad technological importance.},

	abstract = {Significance
            It is commonly expected that cooling a hot system takes a longer time than cooling an identical system initiated at a lower temperature. Surprisingly, this is not always the case; in various systems, including water and magnetic alloys, it has been observed that a hot system can be cooled faster. These anomalous cooling effects are referred to as “the Mpemba effect”, and so far they lack a generic details-independent explanation. Based on recent developments in the theory of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, we propose a generic mechanism for similar effects, demonstrate it in various systems, and predict a similar anomalous behavior in heating.
          , 
            Under certain conditions, it takes a shorter time to cool a hot system than to cool the same system initiated at a lower temperature. This phenomenon—the “Mpemba effect”—was first observed in water and has recently been reported in other systems. Whereas several detail-dependent explanations were suggested for some of these observations, no common underlying mechanism is known. Using the theoretical framework of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, we present a widely applicable mechanism for a similar effect, the Markovian Mpemba effect, derive a sufficient condition for its appearance, and demonstrate it explicitly in three paradigmatic systems: the Ising model, diffusion dynamics, and a three-state system. In addition, we predict an inverse Markovian Mpemba effect in heating: Under proper conditions, a cold system can heat up faster than the same system initiated at a higher temperature. We numerically demonstrate that this inverse effect is expected in a 1D antiferromagnet nearest-neighbors interacting Ising chain in the presence of an external magnetic field. Our results shed light on the mechanism behind anomalous heating and cooling and suggest that it should be possible to observe these in a variety of systems.},

	abstract = {Autonomous Maxwell demon is a new type of information engine proposed by Mandal and Jarzynski, which can produce work by exploiting an information tape. Here, we show that a stochastic resetting mechanism can be used to improve the performance of autonomous Maxwell demons notably. Generally, the performance is composed of two important features, the time cost for an autonomous demon to reach its functional state and its efficacious working region in its functional state. Here, we provide a set of design principles for the system, which are capable of improving the two important features. On the one hand, one can drive any autonomous demon system to its functional periodic steady state at a fastest pace for any initial distribution through resetting the demon for a predetermined critical time and closing the reset after that. On the other hand, the system can reach a new functional state when the resetting is always on, in which case the efficacious region of the demon being extended significantly. Moreover, a dual function region in a new phase diagram of the demon with resetting has been found. Remarkably, in this dual function region the demon with resetting can realize anomalous output of work and erasure of information on the tape simultaneously, violating the second law of thermodynamics apparently. To this question, we derive a new modified Clausius inequality to restore the second law by taking the cost of resetting into account.},

Notably, fundamental limits pertaining to power and efficiency have been intensively studied, as well as trade-off relations between these two quantities. This Letter aims to shed further light on the ultimate limits of heat engines by exploring the relationship between the geometric length along the path of cyclic heat engines operating at arbitrary speeds and their power and efficiency. We reveal that the power of a heat engine is always upper bounded by the product of its geometric length and the statistics of energy. This finding implies that increasing both the energy gap and the energy fluctuation is necessary for achieving high power output. Moreover, we establish a trade-off relation between power and efficiency using the geometric length and the timescale of the heat engine. Our results provide a comprehensive framework for the performance of cyclic heat engines and are universally applicable to both classical and quantum heat engines driven far from equilibrium.},

As a paradigm, we consider a particle initially driven by a non-conservative force along a one-dimensional periodic potential. We show that for an asymmetric potential relaxation from a strongly driven initial state is faster than from a more weakly driven one at least for one of the two possible directions of driving.

	abstract = {Any physical system evolves at a finite speed that is constrained not only by the energetic cost but also by the topological structure of the underlying dynamics. In this Letter, by considering such structural information, we derive a unified topological speed limit for the evolution of physical states using an optimal transport approach. We prove that the minimum time required for changing states is lower bounded by the discrete Wasserstein distance, which encodes the topological information of the system, and the time-averaged velocity. The bound obtained is tight and applicable to a wide range of dynamics, from deterministic to stochastic, and classical to quantum systems. In addition, the bound provides insight into the design principles of the optimal process that attains the maximum speed. We demonstrate the application of our results to chemical reaction networks and interacting many-body quantum systems.},

	abstract = {Thermodynamics serves as a universal means for studying physical systems from an energy perspective. In recent years, with the establishment of the field of stochastic and quantum thermodynamics, the ideas of thermodynamics have been generalized to small fluctuating systems. Independently developed in mathematics and statistics, the optimal transport theory concerns the means by which one can optimally transport a source distribution to a target distribution, deriving a useful metric between probability distributions, called the Wasserstein distance. Despite their seemingly unrelated nature, an intimate connection between these fields has been unveiled in the context of continuous-state Langevin dynamics, providing several important implications for nonequilibrium systems. In this study, we elucidate an analogous connection for discrete cases by developing a thermodynamic framework for discrete optimal transport. We first introduce a novel quantity called dynamical state mobility, which significantly improves the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and provides insights into the precision of currents in nonequilibrium Markov jump processes. We then derive variational formulas that connect the discrete Wasserstein distances to stochastic and quantum thermodynamics of discrete Markovian dynamics described by master equations. Specifically, we rigorously prove that the Wasserstein distance equals the minimum product of irreversible entropy production and dynamical state mobility over all admissible Markovian dynamics. These formulas not only unify the relationship between thermodynamics and the optimal transport theory for discrete and continuous cases, but also generalize it to the quantum case. In addition, we demonstrate that the obtained variational formulas lead to remarkable applications in stochastic and quantum thermodynamics, such as stringent thermodynamic speed limits and the finite-time Landauer principle. These bounds are tight and can be saturated for arbitrary temperatures, even in the zero-temperature limit. Notably, the finite-time Landauer principle can explain finite dissipation even at extremely low temperatures, which cannot be explained by the conventional Landauer principle.},

In a modern standpoint, it is regarded as a feedback control mechanism and the limits of thermodynamics are recast incorporating information-to-energy conversion. We derive a trade-off relation between information-theoretic quantities empowering the design of an efficient Maxwell’s demon in a quantum system. The demon is experimentally implemented as a spin-1/2 quantum memory that acquires information, and employs it to control the dynamics of another spin-1/2 system, through a natural interaction. Noise and imperfections in this protocol are investigated by the assessment of its effectiveness. This realization provides experimental evidence that the irreversibility in a nonequilibrium dynamics can be mitigated by assessing microscopic information and applying a feed-forward strategy at the quantum scale.},

Under the condition of the periodic steady state having been reached, the time durations of the heating and cooling relaxation processes are determined by exploring a distance-from-equilibrium equivalent to the Kullback-Leibler divergence. We then numerically evaluate and compare the averages and variances of both the work and the power output of two scenarios with and without the Mpemba effect.

	abstract = {Under static conditions, a system satisfying detailed balance generically relaxes to an equilibrium state in which there are no currents. To generate persistent currents, either detailed balance must be broken or the system must be driven in a time-dependent manner. A stationary system that violates detailed balance evolves to a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) characterized by fixed currents. Conversely, a system that satisfies instantaneous detailed balance but is driven by the time-periodic variation of external parameters—also known as a stochastic pump (SP)—reaches a periodic state with nonvanishing currents. In both cases, these currents are maintained at the cost of entropy production. Are these two paradigmatic scenarios effectively equivalent? For discrete-state systems, we establish a mapping between nonequilibrium stationary states and stochastic pumps. Given a NESS characterized by a particular set of stationary probabilities, currents, and entropy production rates, we show how to construct a SP with exactly the same (time-averaged) values. The mapping works in the opposite direction as well. These results establish a proof of principle: They show that stochastic pumps are able to mimic the behavior of nonequilibrium steady states, and vice versa, within the theoretical framework of discrete-state stochastic thermodynamics. Nonequilibrium steady states and stochastic pumps are often used to model, respectively, biomolecular motors driven by chemical reactions and artificial molecular machines steered by the variation of external, macroscopic parameters. Our results loosely suggest that anything a biomolecular machine can do, an artificial molecular machine can do equally well. We illustrate this principle by showing that kinetic proofreading, a NESS mechanism that explains the low error rates in biochemical reactions, can be effectively mimicked by a constrained periodic driving.},

Our study reveals a general relation among energy dissipation rate, adaptation speed and the maximum adaptation accuracy. This energy–speed–accuracy relation is tested in the Escherichia coli chemosensory system, which exhibits near-perfect chemoreceptor adaptation. We identify key requirements for the underlying biochemical network to achieve accurate adaptation with a given energy budget. Moreover, direct measurements confirm the prediction that adaptation slows down as cells gradually de-energize in a nutrient-poor medium without compromising adaptation accuracy. Our work provides a general framework to study cost-performance trade-offs for cellular regulatory functions and information processing.},

Here we use the principle underlying the uncertainty relation to quantify the transport efficiency of molecular motors for varying ATP concentration ([ATP]) and applied load (f). Our analyses of experimental data find that transport efficiencies of the motors studied here are semioptimized under the cellular condition. The efficiency is significantly deteriorated for a kinesin-1 mutant that has a longer neck-linker, which underscores the importance of molecular structure. It is remarkable to recognize that, among many possible directions for optimization, biological motors have evolved to optimize the transport efficiency in particular.},

Lett. 127, 060401 (2021)] it was shown that under certain circumstances it was possible to exponentially accelerate the approach to stationarity by performing a unitary transformation of the initial state. This phenomenon can be regarded as the quantum version of the so-called Mpemba effect. The transformation of the initial state removes its overlap with the dynamical mode of the open system dynamics that possesses the slowest decay rate and, thus, determines the spectral gap. Whereas this transformation can be exactly constructed in some cases, it is, in practice, challenging to implement. Here we show that even far simpler transformations constructed by a global unitary spin rotation allow to exponentially speed up relaxation. We demonstrate this using simple dissipative quantum spin systems, which are relevant for current quantum simulation and computation platforms based on trapped atoms and ions.},

These phenomena are typically associated with phase transitions, e.g., the emergence of metastable regimes near a first-order transition or scaling dynamics in the vicinity of critical points. Despite being of fundamental interest the associated divergent timescales are a hindrance when trying to explore steady-state properties. Here we show that the relaxation dynamics of Markovian open quantum systems can be accelerated exponentially by devising an optimal unitary transformation that is applied to the quantum system immediately before the actual dynamics. This initial “rotation” is engineered in such a way that the state of the quantum system no longer excites the slowest decaying dynamical mode. We illustrate our idea—which is inspired by the so-called Mpemba effect, i.e., water freezing faster when initially heated up—by showing how to achieve an exponential speeding-up in the convergence to stationarity in Dicke models, and how to avoid metastable regimes in an all-to-all interacting spin system.},

The value of the minimum entropy production is expressed in terms of the graph-distance based Wasserstein distance between the initial and final configuration. This yields a new kind of speed limit relating dissipation, the average number of transitions and the Wasserstein distance. It also allows us to formulate the optimal transport problem on a graph via continuous-time interpolating dynamics, in complete analogy to the continuous space setting.

However, if we fix a given target state and a set of external control variables, it is not well-understood (i) how to design a protocol to drive the system toward the desired state nor (ii) the cost of persistently perturbing the stationary distribution. In this work, we derive a bound that relates the proximity to the chosen target with the dissipation associated with the external drive, showing that high-dimensional external control can guide systems toward target distribution but with an inevitable cost.

This principle guided the development of Monte Carlo sampling techniques, of which the Metropolis–Hastings (MH) algorithm is the famous representative. It is also known that DB is sufficient but not necessary. We construct irreversible deformation of a given reversible algorithm capable of dramatic improvement of sampling from known distribution. Our transformation modifies transition rates keeping the structure of transitions intact. To illustrate the general scheme we design an Irreversible version of Metropolis–Hastings (IMH) and test it on an example of a spin cluster. Standard MH for the model suffers from critical slowdown, while IMH is free from critical slowdown.},

DSC and WAXD measurements were performed to investigate crystallization behavior and structure of polylactide (PLA) with different thermal histories. A similar Mpemba effect was found during the crystallization process, which showed that the PLA sample quenched from “hot” crystallizes faster than that quenched from the “cold”. The obtained crystallization half-times of isothermal crystallization, and the crystallization temperatures, glass transition temperatures, and melting points during the cold nonisothermal crystallization process with a high heating rate, decrease with holding temperature. The Mpempa effect was discussed and attributed to the temperature dependent chain conformation or local structure of the amorphous and confined effect on the conformation adjustment before PLA crystallization. The unusual crystallization phenomenon of PLA would be helpful to understand the polymer crystallization and control the crystalline structure of PLA.},

The old puzzling observation (also called Mpemba effect) that when a sample of hot water and another sample of cold water are put in a freezer to equilibrate, the hot water sometimes overtakes as they cool, has been highlighted recently. In the extensively studied colossal magnetoresistance manganites, cooling in a magnetic field (H) often results in an inhomogeneous mixture of transformed equilibrium phase and a kinetically arrested non-equilibrium phase which relaxes slowly towards equilibrium at fixed H and temperature (T). Here we show that the magnetization decay rate at the same H and T is larger for the state that was initially farther from equilibrium, and it continues to relax faster even after these have become equal. Our result should help propose an explanation, for Mpemba effect, that does not attribute it to any artifact.},

	abstract = {The exact mechanism of the Mpemba effect of water was recently investigated microscopically and explained on the basis of the cooperative relationship between intramolecular polar-covalent bonds (O-H) and intermolecular hydrogen bonds (O:H). We posited that this relationship might exist in clathrate hydrates since they consist of hydrogen-bonded host water frameworks and enclathrated guest molecules. The formation of tetrahydrofuran (THF) hydrate, which is the simplest clathrate hydrate, was investigated by using differential scanning calorimetry and Raman spectroscopy. THF hydrates show the Mpemba effect at lower initial temperatures, but formation times were delayed at higher initial temperatures because the evaporated THF molecules should be liquefied to correspond to the stoichiometric concentration of guest molecules to form sII clathrate hydrates. However, even though the formation time was delayed at higher initial temperatures, the rates of heat emission during THF hydrate formation, measured in a bulk state, roughly increased as the initial temperature increased. Moreover, we observed that the O: H stretching phonons of water in the THF hydrate showed a blue shift, and the O-H stretching mode showed a redshift as temperature decreased. Both the rate of heat emission and the Raman shift of these two bonds imply that a cooperative relationship between the covalent bond and the hydrogen bond exists in THF hydrate as pure water. The formation kinetics of THF hydrate therefore might depend on its initial temperature, thus showing Mpemba-like behavior.},

In both cases, the system seems to pose a memory of its thermal history; a paradoxical result that is reconciled if the dissipative state of the system is not described uniquely by the system’s average temperature. A vibrational mode projection algorithm is used to track the dissipation pathway, showing that dissipation is dependent strongly on the development of an athermal phonon population.

The lasers are simultaneously applied and uniformly illuminate the atoms; their frequencies are chosen so that the atoms are cooled by the radiative processes, and their intensities are either suddenly switched or slowly ramped across the self-ordering transition.

For a fixed final temperature, a system with higher starting temperature equilibrates faster than the one prepared at a lower temperature, implying the presence of ME. The observation is extremely counter-intuitive, particularly because of the fact that the model has no in-built frustration or metastability that typically is thought to provide ME.

Especially we find that the biggest difference is for 80–160 cm–1 which upon quenching from colder water is much lower than that in ice, while it is much higher than in ice when quenching from warm water. We find that the range of 100–160 cm–1 corresponds to framework vibrations within a hexamer, suggesting that the water hexamer serves as a nucleus for crystallization. We tested this by fixing one hexamer and quenching slowly from 370 K, leading to increased correlation with pure ice. We also showed that the structure quenched from 370 K evolves to the ice faster than 300 K case.

In this paper, we consider the inelastic driven Maxwell gas, a simplified model for a granular gas, where the rate of collision is assumed to be independent of the relative velocity. Through an exact analysis, we determine the conditions under which the Mpemba effect is present in this model. For monodispersed gases, we show that the Mpemba effect is present only when the initial states are allowed to be nonstationary, while for bidispersed gases, it is present for some steady-state initial states. We also demonstrate the existence of the strong Mpemba effect for bidispersed Maxwell gas, wherein the system at higher temperature relaxes to a final steady state at an exponentially faster rate leading to smaller equilibration time.},

We also observe a strong version of anomalous heating, where a cold system heats up exponentially faster than systems prepared under slightly different conditions.},

	abstract = {The Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive relaxation phenomenon, where a system prepared at a hot temperature cools down faster than an identical system initiated at a cold temperature when both are quenched to an even colder bath. Such nonmonotonic relaxations are observed in various systems, including water, magnetic alloys, polymers, and driven granular gases. We analyze the Mpemba effect in Markovian dynamics and discover that a stronger version of the effect often exists for a carefully chosen set of initial temperatures. In this strong Mpemba effect, the relaxation time jumps to a smaller value leading to exponentially faster equilibration dynamics. The number of such special initial temperatures defines the Mpemba index, whose parity is a topological property of the system. To demonstrate these concepts, we first analyze the different types of Mpemba relaxations in the mean-field antiferromagnetic Ising model, which demonstrates a surprisingly rich Mpemba-phase diagram. Moreover, we show that the strong effect survives the thermodynamic limit and that it is tightly connected with thermal overshoot; in the relaxation process, the temperature of the relaxing system can decay nonmonotonically as a function of time. Using the parity of the Mpemba index, we then study the occurrence of the strong Mpemba effect in a large class of thermal quench processes and show that it happens with nonzero probability even in the thermodynamic limit. This study is done by introducing the isotropic model for which we obtain analytical lower bound estimates for the probability of the strong Mpemba effects. Consequently, we expect that such exponentially faster relaxations can be observed experimentally in a wide variety of systems.},

To provide a self-contained presentation, the text begins with a survey of classical probability theory and with an introduction to the foundations of quantum mechanics, with particular emphasis on its statistical interpretation and on the formulation of generalized measurement theory through quantum operations and effects. The fundamentals of density matrix theory, quantum Markov processes, and completely positive dynamical semigroups are developed. The most important master equations used in quantum optics and condensed matter theory are derived and applied to the study of many examples. Special attention is paid to the Markovian and non-Markovian theory of environment induced decoherence, its role in the dynamical description of the measurement process, and to the experimental observation of decohering electromagnetic field states. The book includes the modern formulation of open quantum systems in terms of stochastic processes in Hilbert space. Stochastic wave function methods and Monte Carlo algorithms are designed and applied to important examples from quantum optics and atomic physics. The fundamentals of the treatment of non-Markovian quantum processes in open systems are developed on the basis of various mathematical techniques, such as projection superoperator methods and influence functional techniques. In addition, the book expounds the relativistic theory of quantum measurements and the density matrix theory of relativistic quantum electrodynamics.},

We illustrate the full counting statistics for different choices of the jumping rates. We also show examples of thermodynamic uncertainty relations.

Here, we relate the trace distance and the Hilbert-Schmidt distance with a bound that is particularly strong when either ρ or σ is low rank. Our bound is stronger than the bound one could obtain via the norm equivalence of the Frobenius and trace norms.

	abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics such as work, heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy balance can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. For a basic Markovian dynamics implemented either on the continuum level with Langevin equations or on a discrete set of states as a master equation, thermodynamic consistency imposes a local-detailed balance constraint on noise and rates, respectively. Various integral and detailed fluctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized fluctuation–dissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramifications and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between specified states in finite time, the role of measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility. Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones such as molecular motors, and heat engines such as thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production.},

For certain cases of such interaction reciprocal relations have been deduced by earlier writers, e.g., Thomson's theory of thermoelectric phenomena and Helmholtz' theory for the e.m.f. of electrolytic cells with liquid junction. These earlier derivations may be classed as quasi-thermodynamic; in fact, Thomson himself pointed out that his argument was incomplete, and that his relation ought to be established on an experimental basis. A general class of such relations will be derived by a new theoretical treatment from the principle of microscopic reversibility. (§§1-2.) The analogy with a chemical monomolecular triangle reaction is discussed; in this case a a simple kinetic consideration assuming microscopic reversibility yields a reciprocal relation that is not necessary for fulfilling the requirements of thermodynamics (§3). Reciprocal relations for heat conduction in an anisotropic medium are derived from the assumption of microscopic reversibility, applied to fluctuations. (§4.) The reciprocal relations can be expressed in terms of a potential, the dissipation-function. Lord Rayleigh's "principle of the least dissipation of energy" is generalized to include the case of anisotropic heat conduction. A further generalization is announced. (§5.) The conditions for stationary flow are formulated; the connection with earlier quasi-thermodynamic theories is discussed. (§6.) The principle of dynamical reversibility does not apply when (external) magnetic fields or Coriolis forces are present, and the reciprocal relations break down. (§7.)},

Here, we introduce Waddington-OT, an approach for studying developmental time courses to infer ancestor-descendant fates and model the regulatory programs that underlie them. We apply the method to reconstruct the landscape of reprogramming from 315,000 single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) profiles, collected at half-day intervals across 18 days. The results reveal a wider range of developmental programs than previously characterized. Cells gradually adopt either a terminal stromal state or a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition state. The latter gives rise to populations related to pluripotent, extra-embryonic, and neural cells, with each harboring multiple finer subpopulations. The analysis predicts transcription factors and paracrine signals that affect fates and experiments validate that the TF Obox6 and the cytokine GDF9 enhance reprogramming efficiency. Our approach sheds light on the process and outcome of reprogramming and provides a framework applicable to diverse temporal processes in biology.},

In this Letter we develop a new method for solving the discrete version of this problem using techniques derived from statistical physics. We derive a strongly concave free energy function that captures the constraints of the OT problem at a finite temperature. Its maximum defines an optimal transport plan, or registration between the two discrete probability measures that are compared, as well as a pseudodistance between those measures that satisfies the triangular inequalities. The computation of this pseudodistance is fast and numerically stable. The temperature dependent OT pseudodistance is shown to decrease monotonically with respect to the inverse of the temperature and to converge to the standard OT distance at zero temperature, providing a robust framework for temperature annealing. We illustrate applications of this framework to the problem of image comparison.},

	abstract = {Image registration is the process of establishing a common geometric reference frame between two or more image data sets possibly taken at different times. In this paper we present a method for computing elastic registration and warping maps based on the Monge–Kantorovich theory of optimal mass transport. This mass transport method has a number of important characteristics. First, it is parameter free. Moreover, it utilizes all of the grayscale data in both images, places the two images on equal footing and is symmetrical: the optimal mapping from image A to image B being the inverse of the optimal mapping from B to A. The method does not require that landmarks be specified, and the minimizer of the distance functional involved is unique; there are no other local minimizers. Finally, optimal transport naturally takes into account changes in density that result from changes in area or volume. Although the optimal transport method is certainly not appropriate for all registration and warping problems, this mass preservation property makes the Monge–Kantorovich approach quite useful for an interesting class of warping problems, as we show in this paper. Our method for finding the registration mapping is based on a partial differential equation approach to the minimization of the L2 Kantorovich–Wasserstein or “Earth Mover's Distance” under a mass preservation constraint. We show how this approach leads to practical algorithms, and demonstrate our method with a number of examples, including those from the medical field. We also extend this method to take into account changes in intensity, and show that it is well suited for applications such as image morphing.},

A basic assumption is that the expression for Shannon entropy is the appropriate description for the entropy of a nonequilibrium system in such a setting. Here we measure experimentally this function in a system that is in local but not global equilibrium. Our system is a micron-scale colloidal particle in water, in a virtual double-well potential created by a feedback trap. We measure the work to erase a fraction of a bit of information and show that it is bounded by the Shannon entropy for a two-state system. Further, by measuring directly the reversibility of slow protocols, we can distinguish unambiguously between protocols that can and cannot reach the expected thermodynamic bounds.},

More recently, this historically theoretical pursuit has become relevant in practical situations where information is manipulated at small scales, such as in molecular and cell biology, artificial nano-devices or quantum computation. Here we give an introduction to a novel theoretical framework for the thermodynamics of information based on stochastic thermodynamics and fluctuation theorems, review some recent experimental results, and present an overview of the state of the art in the field.},

In the derivation, certain average products of fluctuations are considered. As a consequence of the general relation S=k logW between entropy and probability, different (coupled) irreversible processes must be compared in terms of entropy changes. If the displacement from thermodynamic equilibrium is described by a set of variables α1,⋯,αn, and the relations between the rates ˙α1,⋯,˙αn and the "forces" ∂Sdα1,⋯,∂Sdαn are linear, there exists a quadratic dissipation-function, 2Φ(˙α,˙α)≡Σρj˙αij˙αi=dSdt=˙S(α,˙α)≡Σ(∂Sdαj)˙αj (denoting definition by ≡). The symmetry conditions demanded by microscopic reversibility are equivalent to the variation-principle ˙S(α,˙α)−Φ(˙α,˙α)=maximum, which determines ˙α1,⋯,˙αn for prescribed α1,⋯,αn. The dissipation-function has a statistical significance similar to that of the entropy. External magnetic fields, and also Coriolis forces, destroy the symmetry in past and future; reciprocal relations involving reversal of the field are formulated.},

We find that nonequilibrium current fluctuations are always more likely than what is expected from a linear-response analysis. As a small-fluctuations corollary, we derive a recently conjectured uncertainty bound on the variance of current fluctuations.},

The stochastic model is based on the master equation approach and is intimately related to the grand canonical ensemble of statistical mechanics. We show that it is possible to analytically calculate the joint probability function of the random variables describing the number of molecules in each state of the system for general linear networks. Definitions of reaction chemical potentials and conductances follow from inherent properties of this model, providing a description of energy dissipation in the system. We are also able to suggest novel methods for experimentally determining reaction fluxes and biochemical affinities at nonequilibrium steady state as well as the overall network connectivity.},

In extended quantum systems, this problem is intrinsically bound to the subsystem of interest. Hence, in this work, we borrow methods from the theory of entanglement in many-body quantum systems to introduce a subsystem measure of symmetry breaking that we dub entanglement asymmetry. As a prototypical illustration, we study the entanglement asymmetry in a quantum quench of a spin chain in which an initially broken global U(1) symmetry is restored dynamically. We adapt the quasiparticle picture for entanglement evolution to the analytic determination of the entanglement asymmetry. We find, expectedly, that larger is the subsystem, slower is the restoration, but also the counterintuitive result that more the symmetry is initially broken, faster it is restored, a sort of quantum Mpemba effect, a phenomenon that we show to occur in a large variety of systems.},

	abstract = {The ability to reroute and control flow is vital to the function of venation networks across a wide range of organisms. By modifying individual edges in these networks, either by adjusting edge conductances or creating and destroying edges, organisms robustly control the propagation of inputs to perform specific tasks. However, a fundamental disconnect exists between the structure and function: networks with different local architectures can perform the same functions. Here, we answer the question of how changes at the level of individual edges collectively create functionality at the scale of an entire network. Using persistent homology, we analyze networks tuned to perform complex tasks. We find that the responses of such networks encode a hidden topological structure composed of sectors of nearly uniform pressure. Although these sectors are not apparent in the underlying network structure, they correlate strongly with the tuned function. The connectivity of these sectors, rather than that of individual nodes, provides a quantitative relationship between structure and function in flow networks.},

	abstract = {Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are invaluable tools for exploring stationary properties of physical systems, especially in situations where direct sampling is unfeasible. Common implementations of Monte Carlo algorithms employ reversible Markov chains. Reversible chains obey detailed balance and thus ensure that the system will eventually relax to equilibrium, though detailed balance is not necessary for convergence to equilibrium. We review nonreversible Markov chains, which violate detailed balance and yet still relax to a given target stationary distribution. In particular cases, nonreversible Markov chains are substantially better at sampling than the conventional reversible Markov chains with up to a square root improvement in the convergence time to the steady state. One kind of nonreversible Markov chain is constructed from the reversible ones by enlarging the state space and by modifying and adding extra transition rates to create non-reversible moves. Because of the augmentation of the state space, such chains are often referred to as lifted Markov Chains. We illustrate the use of lifted Markov chains for efficient sampling on several examples. The examples include sampling on a ring, sampling on a torus, the Ising model on a complete graph, and the one-dimensional Ising model. We also provide a pseudocode implementation, review related work, and discuss the applicability of such methods.},

Specifically, the gas particles interact among them via elastic collisions and with a background fluid at equilibrium. Thus, within the framework of kinetic theory, our gas is described by an Enskog–Fokker–Planck equation. The analysis is carried out using the first Sonine approximation, in which the evolution of temperature is coupled to that of excess kurtosis. This coupling leads to the emergence of the Mpemba effect, which is observed at an early stage of relaxation and when the initial temperatures of the two samples are close enough. This allows for the development of a simple theory, linearizing the temperature evolution around a reference temperature, namely, the initial temperature closer to the asymptotic equilibrium value. The linear theory provides a semiquantitative description of the effect, including expressions for crossover time and maximum temperature difference. We also discuss the limitations of our linearized theory.},
