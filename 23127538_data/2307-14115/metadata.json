  "abstract": "In this article, the structure of the Clifford-Weyl superalgebras and their associated Lie superalgebras will be investigated. These superalgebras have a natural supersymmetric inner product which is invariant under their Lie superalgebra structures. The Clifford-Weyl superalgebras can be realized as tensor product of the algebra of alternating and symmetric tensors respectively, on the even and odd parts of their underlying superspace. For Physical applications in elementary particles, we add star structures to these algebras and investigate the basic relations. Ortho-symplectic Lie algebras are naturally present in these algebras and their representations on these algebras can be described easily.",
