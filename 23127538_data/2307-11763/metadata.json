  "abstract": "As robots become increasingly prevalent in work-oriented collaborations, trust has emerged as a critical factor in their acceptance and effectiveness. However, trust is dynamic and can erode when mistakes are made. Despite emerging research on trust repair in human-robot interaction, significant questions remain about identifying reliable approaches to restoring trust in robots after trust violations occur. To address this problem, my research aims to identify effective strategies for designing robots capable of trust repair in human-robot interaction (HRI) and to explore the underlying mechanisms that make these strategies successful. This paper provides an overview of the fundamental concepts and key components of the trust repair process in HRI, as well as a summary of my current published work in this area. Additionally, I discuss the research questions that will guide my future work and the potential contributions that this research could make to the field.",
