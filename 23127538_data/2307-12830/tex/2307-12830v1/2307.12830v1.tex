\begin{abstract}
%
We study the effects of a spatially homogenous magnetic field in Bianchi-I cosmological models.
In particular, we consider the case of a pure magnetic field and two models with dust and a massless
scalar field (stiff matter), respectively.
In all these cases, we analyze the approach to the singularity in some detail and comment on the
issue of the singularity crossing.

\section{Introduction}
%
\label{s:intro}
%
Almost all of modern cosmology is based on the spatially homogeneous
and isotropic Friedmann--Lema\^itre cosmological models.
Indeed, the Friedmann{--}Lema\^itre cosmology for an expanding or contracting spatially homogeneous and isotropic
universe is very successful in describing the global evolution of the universe
from inflation to the present epoch of cosmic acceleration.
Moreover, inhomogeneities in our universe are described by means of the theory of cosmological perturbations
on the Friedmann background, which explains the origin of large-scale structures in the contemporary universe
starting from quantum fluctuations in the very early universe.
\par
However, there are very interesting features in gravity and cosmology beyond the Friedmann models
and perturbations on such backgrounds. 
The study of spatially homogeneous but anisotropic models (see, e.g.,~Refs.~\cite{Land-Lif,Ryan,Bel-Hen})
originating in the work of Bianchi, published as early as in the year 1898~\cite{Bianchi}, presents great interest
from both the mathematical and physical points of view. Bianchi elaborated on the complete classification of
the three-dimensional homogeneous Riemann spaces and three-dimensional Lie groups long before Einstein
put forward General Relativity in 1915.
Bianchi classification was then modernized, simplified, and applied to cosmology in the 50s and 60s~\cite{Held,Kras,Ellis}. 
\par
The simplest spatially homogeneous and anisotropic cosmology is given by the Bianchi-I model. 
Its isometry group contains three generators, Killing vector fields, which commute with each other.
The metric has the following form:
\begin{equation}\label{Bianchi-I}
ds^2 = dt^2 - a^2(t)\,dx^2 - b^2(t)\,dy^2 - c^2(t)\,dz^2
\ .
\end{equation}
One can see that Eq.~\eqref{Bianchi-I} reduces to a flat Friedmann metric in the limiting case when
all of the scale factors $a(t)$, $b(t)$, and $c(t)$ coincide.  
\par
The first general exact solution for the metric~\eqref{Bianchi-I} in empty space was found by Kasner~\cite{Kasner},
in fact before Friedmann's works. The Kasner solution has been rediscovered many times, and its importance was only appreciated later. 
A particular form of Kasner's solution for the Bianchi-I universe had been discovered earlier in Refs.~\cite{Weyl,Levi-Civita}.  
In 1963, Khalatnikov and Lifshitz began employing the Bianchi universes (Bianchi-I, in particular) for studying the problem of the cosmological singularity~\cite{Lif-Khal}.
At the end of the 1960s, Belinski, Khalatnikov, and Lifshitz discovered the phenomenon of the oscillatory approach to the cosmological singularity~\cite{BKL,BKL1}.
Using the Hamiltonian formalism, Misner described this phenomenon as the Mixmaster
Universe~\cite{Misner}.
Later, it was understood that, when the universe approaches the singularity, its dynamics becomes chaotic~\cite{chaos,chaos1}.
Finally, the connection between the chaotic behavior in cosmological models and
infinite-dimensional Lie algebras~\cite{Kac} was discovered at the beginning of the
new millennium~\cite{DHN,DHN1,DHN2}. Thus, the study of Bianchi cosmologies, starting from the empty Bianchi-I model,
has already led to some unexpected discoveries.
In the meantime, exact solutions for the Bianchi-I universe filled with matter
were also studied.
First of all, we mention the Heckmann--Schucking solution, which describes the Bianchi-I universe filled with dust~\cite{Heck-Schuck}. 
The Heckmann--Schucking universe behaves as the Kasner universe at the beginning of evolution,
after which isotropization takes place so that the universe approaches an isotropic Friedmann
regime while expanding.
The generalization of the Heckmann--Schucking solution to other kinds of isotropic perfect fluids
was obtained by Jacobs~\cite{Jacobs0,Jacobs,Jacobs1}, and other generalizations were found more
recently~\cite{Khal-Kam,Kam-Ming}. 
\par
While exact solutions with a highly anisotropic geometry do exist even in empty space or in a universe
filled with isotropic matter, the situation becomes even more riveting in the presence of spatially homogenous but anisotropic matter.
A magnetic field is an interesting example of such a source.
Indeed, papers devoted to the Bianchi-I universes being filled with a spatially homogeneous magnetic field oriented along one of the coordinate axes in Eq.~\eqref{Bianchi-I}, sometimes with additional types of matter, were published already in the early
60s~\cite{Rosen,Rosen1,Dorosh,Shikin,Thorne,Jacobs}.  
\par
The interest in solutions involving magnetic fields is not purely academic.
The existence of large-scale magnetic fields in our universe is an important and
enigmatic phenomenon (see, e.g.,~Ref.~\cite{Barrow-magn}).
Their origin is not known and is being widely discussed.
Thus, even if it is unrealistic to describe the present-day Universe with the Bianchi-I metric, models where this metric is sustained by a magnetic field can be useful to shed light
on processes that occurred in the very early universe.
In spite of the long history of studies of cosmic magnetic fields in general and in the
Bianchi-I universe in particular, to our knowledge, there is no detailed description of the qualitative behavior of the corresponding solutions.
Besides, it would be interesting to try and bridge the established (and sometimes, implicit)
knowledge about solutions with magnetic fields with innovative approaches to the
problem of the singularities in gravity and theoretical cosmology.
In this paper, we shall try to fill some gaps and look for new ways in this direction.
\par
The structure of the paper is the following: in Sec.~\ref{s:BianchiIB}, we consider the
Bianchi-I model, filled with a spatially homogeneous magnetic field directed
along the $z$ axis of Eq.~\eqref{Bianchi-I}. 
We then consider two other models in Sec.~\ref{s:BianchiIBF}, one in which dust is added and one
with an additional massless scalar field (or, in other words, stiff matter).
Sec.~\ref{s:sing} is devoted to the possibility of crossing the singularity in these models,
and Sec.~\ref{s:conc} contains some concluding remarks.

\section{Bianchi-I model with spatially homogeneous magnetic field}
%
\label{s:BianchiIB}
%
%
Let us consider the Bianchi-I universe with metric~\eqref{Bianchi-I}.
The Lagrangian of the electromagnetic field is (in the Gaussian system)~\cite{Land-Lif}
\begin{equation}\label{elec}
L_{\rm em} = -\frac{1}{16 \pi}\,F_{ik}\,F^{ik},
\end{equation}  
where Latin indices are four-dimensional.~\footnote{Of course, $x^i=(t,x,y,z)$
in Eq.~\eqref{Bianchi-I}, $i=\overline{0,3}$.} 
The energy-momentum tensor of the electromagnetic field with the Lagrangian~\eqref{elec} has the form
\begin{equation}\label{elec1}
T_{\ k}^{i}
= \frac{1}{4\,\pi} \left(-F^{il}\,F_{kl}
+ \frac{1}{4} \, \delta_k^i\, F_{lm}\, F^{lm}\right).
\end{equation}
In particular, we consider the case with no electric field and a homogeneous magnetic field
along $z$.
Hence, the only non-zero component of the electromagnetic field tensor is $F_{12}$. 
The sourceless Maxwell equation for the electromagnetic field is given by
\begin{equation}\label{elec2}
F_{[ij;k]} = 0,
\end{equation} 
where semicolons denote covariant derivatives for metric~\eqref{Bianchi-I} and
square brackets imply antisymmetrization.
Since there is no torsion, the symmetric connection terms cancel out and
Eq.~\eqref{elec2} simplifies to 
%\begin{equation}\label{elec3}
$F_{[ij,k]} = 0$.
%\ . \end{equation} 
Choosing the triplet of indices $0$, $1$, and $2$, we see that 
%\begin{equation} \label{elec4}
$F_{12,0} = 0$,
%\end{equation}
which means that $F_{12}$ is constant. 
For diagonal spacetime~\eqref{Bianchi-I}, the only non-vanishing component of the
fully contravariant electromagnetic field tensor is thus given~by 
\begin{equation}\label{elec5}
F^{12} = g^{11}\,g^{22}\,F_{12} \sim a^{-2}\,b^{-2}.
\end{equation}
That means that all the contributions to the mixed components of the energy-momentum tensor
in Eq.~\eqref{elec1} are proportional to $a^{-2}\,b^{-2}$.
On choosing a convenient parametrization, we can then write 
\begin{equation}\label{elec6}
T_{\ 0}^0 = -T_{\ 1}^1 = -T_{\ 2}^2 = T^3_{\ 3} = \frac{B_0^2}{a^2 b^2},
\end{equation}
where $B_0^2$ is a positive constant characterizing the intensity of the magnetic field.
It is easy to see that the trace $T$ of the energy-momentum tensor~\eqref{elec6} vanishes,
as it should. 
\par
It is convenient to write down the Einstein equations, 
\begin{equation}\label{Ein}
G^i_{\ j} \equiv R^i_{\ j} - \frac{1}{2}\,{\cal R}\,\delta^i_{\ j} = T^i_{\ j},
\end{equation}
using the parametrization for the scale factors as %given by
\begin{equation} \begin{split}\label{magn9} a(t) &= R(t) \, \e^{\alpha(t)+\beta(t)}, \\  b(t) &= R(t) \, \e^{\alpha(t)-\beta(t)}, \\
c(t) &= R(t) \, \e^{-2\alpha(t)}.
\end{split} \end{equation}
The components of the Ricci tensor then read
\begin{eqnarray}
 R_{\ 0}^0
&\!\!=\!\!&
- 3 \frac{\ddot{R}}{R} -6 \dot{\alpha}^2 - 2 \dot{\beta}^2,
 \label{magn10}
 \\
 R_{\ 1}^1
 &\!\!=\!\!&
- \frac{\ddot{R}}{R} - 2 \frac{\dot{R}^2}{R^2} - \ddot{\alpha} - 3 \dot{\alpha} \frac{\dot{R}}{R} - \ddot{\beta} - 3 \dot{\beta} \frac{\dot{R}}{R},
 \label{magn11}
 \\
 R_{\ 2}^2
 &\!\!=\!\!&
 - \frac{\ddot{R}}{R} - 2 \frac{\dot{R}^2}{R^2} - \ddot{\alpha} - 3 \dot{\alpha} \frac{\dot{R}}{R} + \ddot{\beta} + 3 \dot{\beta} \frac{\dot{R}}{R},
 \label{magn12}
 \\
R_{\ 3}^3
&\!\!=\!\!&
- \frac{\ddot{R}}{R} - 2 \frac{\dot{R}^2}{R^2} + 2 \ddot{\alpha} + 6 \dot{\alpha}\frac{\dot{R}}{R},
\label{magn13}
\end{eqnarray}
and Einstein's equations are given by
\begin{equation}\label{magn14}
G_{\ 0}^0 = -G^1_{\ 1} = -G^2_{\ 2} = G_{\ 3}^3
= \frac{B_0^2}{R^4}\, \e^{-4\alpha}.
\end{equation}
Note also that the scalar curvature is %given by
\begin{equation}\label{Ricci}
{\cal R} = - 6 \frac{\ddot{R}}{R} - 6 \frac{\dot{R}^2}{R^2} - 6\dot{\alpha}^2 - 2 \dot{\beta}^2,
\end{equation}
which must vanish since $T=0$.

%\newpage
Taking the difference of the mixed $11$ and $22${--}components of Einstein's equations~\eqref{magn14}
with the expressions~\eqref{magn11} and~\eqref{magn12} for the Ricci tensor, we obtain
\begin{equation}\label{magn19}
R_{\ 1}^1-R_{\ 2}^2 = - 2\ddot{\beta} - 6\, \dot{\beta}\frac{\dot{R}}{R} = 0.
\end{equation}
Hence,
\begin{equation}\label{magn20}
\dot{\beta} = \frac{\beta_0}{R^3},
\end{equation}
just like in the Kasner and Heckmann-Schucking solutions, see~Ref.~\cite{Khal-Kam}. 
\par
Likewise, combining Eqs~\eqref{magn11}, \eqref{magn12}, and~\eqref{magn13} yields
\begin{equation}\label{magn21}
R_{\ 1}^1+R_{\ 2}^2-2R_{\ 3}^3
= -6\ddot{\alpha}-18\,\dot{\alpha}\frac{\dot{R}}{R} = -\frac{4B_0^2}{R^4}\, \e^{-4\alpha},
\end{equation}
or
\begin{equation}
\ddot{\alpha}+3\dot{\alpha}\frac{\dot{R}}{R} = \frac{2\,B_0^2}{3\,R^4}\, \e^{-4\alpha}.
\label{magn22}
\end{equation}
Moreover,  
\begin{equation}
R_{\ 1}^1+R_{\ 2}^2+2 R_{\ 3}^3
= -4 \frac{\ddot{R}}{R} - 8\frac{\dot{R}^2}{R^2} + 6\dot{\alpha} \frac{\dot{R}}{R} +2 \ddot{\alpha} = 0
\label{magn23}
\end{equation}
yields
\begin{equation}
\ddot{\alpha}+3\dot{\alpha}\frac{\dot{R}}{R} = 2\frac{\ddot{R}}{R}+4\frac{\dot{R}^2}{R^2}.
\label{magn24}
\end{equation}
By multiplying for the spatial volume, $V=R^3$, the equation above can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}\label{magn26}
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\dot{\alpha} R^3\right)
=\frac{d}{dt}\left(2 \dot{R}\,R^2\right), \end{equation}
whose integration gives 
\begin{equation}\label{magn28}
\dot{\alpha} = \frac{2\dot{R}}{R}+\frac{\alpha_0}{R^3},
\end{equation}
where $\alpha_0$ is a constant.
Combining Eqs.~\eqref{magn22} and \eqref{magn24} leads to
\begin{equation}\label{magn29}
\frac{1}{R^3}\,\frac{d^2R^3}{dt^2}
= \frac{B_0^2}{R^4}\, \e^{-4\alpha}.
\end{equation}
Thus, we can determine $\alpha(t)$ for a given $R=R(t)$ and we further notice that
the second time derivative of the spatial volume, $V=R^3$, must always be positive.

Substituting Eqs.~\eqref{magn10}, \eqref{Ricci}, \eqref{magn20}, \eqref{magn28} and~\eqref{magn29}
into the $(00)${--}component of the Einstein Eqs.~\eqref{magn14}, we obtain 
\begin{equation}\label{magn30}
\frac{1}{R^3}\,\frac{d^2R^3}{dt^2}
+ 9 \frac{\dot{R}^2}{R^2}+12 \frac{\alpha_0}{R^3}\frac{\dot{R}}{R}+3\,\frac{\alpha_0^2}{R^6} + \frac{\beta_0^2}{R^6} = 0,
\end{equation}
which can be written as the differential equation for the spatial volume
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{\ddot{V}}{V}
%+
%\frac{\dot{V}^2}{V^2}+4\,\frac{\alpha_0}{V}\,\frac{\dot{V}}{V}+3\,\frac{\alpha_0^2}{V^2}
%+\frac{\beta_0^2}{V^2}
%=
%0
%\ .
%\label{magn32}
%\end{equation}
% This equations gives 
\begin{equation}\label{magn33}
V\,\ddot{V}+\dot{V}^2+4 \alpha_0 \dot{V} + 3\alpha_0^2 + \beta_0^2 = 0.
\end{equation}
Remarkably, this equation is integrable, but it is useful to perform a qualitative analysis first. 
\par
First of all, let us note that not all solutions of Eq.~\eqref{magn33} solve
the complete system of Einstein and Maxwell equations.
In fact, Eq.~\eqref{magn33} gives 
\begin{equation}\label{magn40}
\ddot{V} = -\frac{1}{V}
\left(\dot{V}^2 + 4 \alpha_0\,\dot{V}+3 \alpha_0^2 + \beta_0^2 \right),
\end{equation}
which must be positive according to Eq.~\eqref{magn29}. 
Since $V$ should always be nonnegative, the positivity of $\ddot{V}$ implies that the 
product $\alpha_0 \dot V<0$, with $\alpha_0\neq 0$ and
\begin{equation}\label{magn41}
-2\alpha_0 -\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2} \, 
\leq \, \dot{V} \leq -2\alpha_0+\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2},
\end{equation}
which is only possible for
\begin{equation}\label{magn42}
\alpha_0^2 \geq \beta_0^2.
\end{equation}
%
%
\subsection{Contracting universe}
%
Let us first consider $\alpha_0>0$, corresponding to a contracting universe
with $\dot V<0$.
One can start at a certain moment in time with a positive value of $V$ and a negative value of
$\dot{V}$ satisfying the inequality~\eqref{magn42}.
Since $\ddot{V}>0$, the time derivative of $V$ grows, remaining negative, and the absolute value of $\dot{V}$ decreases,
always satisfying the constraint
\begin{equation}\label{magn43}
\bigl| \dot{V} \bigr| \, \geq \, 2 \alpha_0 - \sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}
\equiv W_1.
\end{equation}
The universe will therefore reach the singularity characterised by $V = 0$ in
a finite period of time.
\par
Now, we can consider two times $t_1$ and $t_2$ such that 
\begin{equation}\label{time}
V(t_1) = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad 
%\end{equation} and  \begin{equation}\label{time1}
\dot{V}(t_2) = -W_1,
\end{equation}
and we would like to understand which happens first. 
%Firstly, let us s
Suppose that $t_1 < t_2$, so that $V$ vanishes while $\dot{V}$ still satisfies
the inequality~\eqref{magn41} with $|\dot{V}|$ larger than the critical value $W_1$
from Eq.~\eqref{magn43}.
The time $t_1$ cannot be infinite because the absolute value of the time derivative is larger
than $W_1$ and the function $V=V(t)$ reaches zero in a finite period of time.
\par
In particular, one can approximate the volume function for $t\lesssim t_1$ with the expression 
\begin{equation}\label{dif3}
V \simeq \sigma \,(t_1-t)^{\lambda},
\end{equation}  
where $\sigma$ and $\lambda$ are positive constants.
For $\lambda > 1$, the velocity becomes 
\begin{equation}\label{dif4}
\dot{V} \simeq -\lambda\, \sigma \,(t_1-t)^{\lambda -1} \to 0 \quad {\rm for} \ t \to t_1,
\end{equation}
which contradicts the condition~\eqref{magn43}. 
On the other hand, if $\lambda < 1$, the velocity in Eq.~\eqref{dif4} diverges for $t\to t_1$, which
violates the bound~\eqref{magn41}.
The only choice left is $\lambda=1$, in which case we need another term in the expansion
around $t_1$, namely,
\begin{equation} \label{dif5}
V \simeq \sigma \,(t_1-t) + \eta_1 \,(t_1 -t)^{\mu}
\ ,
\end{equation}
where $\eta_1$ is a positive constant and $\mu > 1$. 
%Then, \begin{equation} \label{dif6} \dot{V} \simeq -\sigma - \mu\, \eta_1 \,(t_1-t)^{\mu-1} \end{equation}
%and  \begin{equation}\label{dif7} \ddot{V} \simeq \mu\, \eta_1 \, (\mu-1)\,(t_1 - t)^{\mu-2}. \end{equation}
Substituting the corresponding expressions for $V$, $\dot{V}$, and $\ddot{V}$ %~\eqref{dif5}-\eqref{dif7} 
into Eq.~\eqref{magn33}, we have
\begin{widetext}
%\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{equation}\label{dif8}
\mu \, \eta_1 \,\left(\mu-1\right) \left[\sigma (t_1-t) + \eta_1 (t_1-t)^{\mu}\right]
(t_1-t)^{\mu-2}
%&\!\!\simeq\!\!&
\simeq 
-\left[\sigma +\mu\, \eta_1 \, (t_1-t)^{\mu-1} -2\alpha_0 \right]^2 %+ 4\alpha_0 \Bigl(A+\mu B_1\,(t_1-t)^{\mu-1}\Bigr)
%\nonumber \\ &&
%\\ & \quad 
+\alpha_0^2 - \beta_0^2
\ . 
\end{equation}
%\end{eqnarray}
\end{widetext}
The leading term in the left-hand side above behaves as $(t_1-t)^{\mu-1}$,
which vanishes for $t\to t_1$.
The leading term in the right-hand side is instead a constant, which should therefore vanish, to wit
\begin{equation}\label{dif9}
\sigma^2-4\alpha_0\sigma +3\alpha_0^2 + \beta_0^2 = 0.
\end{equation}
One of the solutions of this equation is 
\begin{equation}\label{dif10}
\sigma = W_1,
\end{equation}
which means that $\dot{V}$ reaches the critical value $W_1$ at the same time when the 
volume $V$ vanishes, so that $t_1=t_2$. 
Next, we equate terms of order $(t_1-t)^{\mu-1}$ in Eq.~\eqref{dif8},
\begin{equation}\label{dif11}
\mu\, \eta_1 (\mu-1)\, \sigma
= -2\mu\, \eta_1 (\sigma -2 \alpha_0), %\,\mu\, \eta,
\end{equation}
which gives 
\begin{equation}\label{dif12}
\mu = 1 + \frac{2\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2 \,}}{2\alpha_0-\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2 \,}}.
\end{equation}
One can see that 
\begin{equation}\label{dif13}
1 < \mu \leq 3, \end{equation}
whereas the constant $\eta_1$ takes different values depending on the initial conditions.
\par 
We could also consider the case of $\dot V$ reaching the critical value $-W_1$
at the moment $t_2<t_1 $ while the volume $V(t_2) > 0$.
A simple analysis similar to that presented above shows that this case is excluded.
Thus, we can say that, for any contracting evolution, the universe hits the singularity 
$V=0$ at some finite time $t_1$ when the velocity $\dot{V}$ reaches the critical value
$-W_1$.  
\par 
From the (approximate) evolution law of the volume, we can determine the anisotropy factors
$\alpha(t)$ and $\beta(t)$.
Using the result~\eqref{magn20}, we immediately find 
\begin{equation}\label{dif14}
\beta(t) = \beta_0 \int \frac{d t}{V} \simeq
-\frac{\beta_0\,\ln(t_1-t)}{2\alpha_0-\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}}.
\end{equation}
Analogously, from Eq.~\eqref{magn28} we get
\begin{equation}\label{dif15}
\alpha(t) \simeq
\left(\frac23 -\frac{\alpha_0}{2\alpha_0-\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}}\right)\ln(t_1-t). 
\end{equation} 
For definiteness, let us set $\beta_0 \geq 0$.
Using definitions~\eqref{magn9}, we can write the three scale factors 
in the Kasner form
\begin{eqnarray}\label{dif19}
a(t)
&\!\!\sim\!\!&
\left(t_1-t\right)^{p_1}, \nonumber \\
b(t)
&\!\!\sim\!\!&
\left(t_1-t\right)^{p_2}, \\
c(t)
&\!\!\sim\!\!&
\left(t_1-t\right)^{p_3}, \nonumber \end{eqnarray}
where \begin{eqnarray}\label{dif20}
p_1
&\!\!=\!\!& 
\frac{\alpha_0-\beta_0-\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}}{2\alpha_0-\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}} < 0,
\nonumber
\\
p_2
&\!\!=\!\!&
\frac{\alpha_0+\beta_0-\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}}{2\alpha_0-\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}} > 0,
\\
p_3
&\!\!=\!\!&
\frac{\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}}{2\alpha_0-\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}} >0.
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
It is straightforward to check that the exponents $p_1$, $p_2$, and $p_3$ indeed satisfy the Kasner relations,
i.e.,
\begin{equation}
p_1+p_2+p_3 = p_1^2+p_2^2+p_3^2=1,
\label{dif21}
\end{equation}
which means that the presence of the magnetic field does not change the character of the singularity.
%It is easy to understand 
The reason for such a behavior is not hard to guess.
Substituting the expressions for $V$ and $\ddot{V}$ into Eq.~\eqref{magn29},
one obtains that the magnetic field contributes to Einstein's equations as
\begin{equation}\label{dif22}
\frac{B_0^2}{a^2 b^2}
\sim \frac{\mu\,\eta_1}{\sigma} \, (\mu-1)\,(t_1-t)^{\mu-3}
\ ,
\end{equation}
where $\mu-3 > -2$.
Therefore, the term~\eqref{dif22} is weaker than the anisotropy, which contributes a term of order
$(t_1-t)^{-2}$ and dominates near the singularity. The presence of matter less stiff than stiff matter is well known to
leave the Kasner type of singularity unaffected~\cite{Bel-Khal}.
%
%
\subsection{Expanding universe}
% 
Let us consider now the expanding universe.
In this case, the constant $\alpha_0<0$ and the time derivative $\dot{V}$ will correspondingly be positive.
The expansion will last for $t\to\infty$ with the time derivative $\dot{V}$ approaching the critical value 
\begin{equation}\label{V2}
W_2 = -2 \alpha_0 + \sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}
 >0.
\end{equation}
Thus, the behavior of $V=V(t)$ can be approximated in the limit $t\to\infty$ as 
\begin{equation}\label{dif23}
V \simeq W_2\,t-\eta_2\,t^{\nu}
\ ,
\end{equation} 
where $\eta_2$ is a positive constant and $0 < \nu < 1$.
Then,
%\begin{equation}\label{dif24} \dot{V} \simeq W_2-\nu\, \eta_2\,t^{\nu-1} \end{equation}   and \begin{equation}\label{dif25} \ddot{V} \simeq -\nu\,(\nu-1)\,\eta_2\,t^{\nu-2}. \end{equation} Substituting the expressions~\eqref{dif23}-\eqref{dif25} 
substituting the corresponding expressions for $V$, $\dot{V}$, and $\ddot{V}$ in Eq.~\eqref{magn33}, we find again
\begin{equation}\label{dif26}
\nu = 1 + \frac{2\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2\, }}{2 \alpha_0 - \sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}}
\ ,
\end{equation}
with $\dfrac13 \leq \nu < 1$.
%\begin{equation}\label{dif27} \frac13 \leq \nu < 1. \end{equation}
The anisotropy factors then read
\begin{equation}\label{dif29}
\alpha= \left(\frac23+\frac{\alpha_0}{\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}-2\alpha_0} \right) \ln{t}
\end{equation} and 
\begin{equation}\label{dif28}
\beta = \frac{\beta_0\, \ln{t}}{\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}-2\alpha_0}.
\end{equation}
Correspondingly, the scale factors take again the Kasner form
%\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{equation}\label{dif30}
a(t) \sim 
%&\!\!\sim\!\!&
t^{p_1}, \quad 
%\nonumber \\
b(t) \sim 
%&\!\!\sim\!\!&
t^{p_2}, \quad 
%\\
c(t) \sim 
%&\!\!\sim\!\!&
t^{p_3},
%\nonumber
\end{equation} %\end{eqnarray}
where 
\begin{eqnarray}
p_1
&\!\!=\!\!&
\frac{\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}-\alpha_0+\beta_0}{\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}-2\alpha_0},
\nonumber
\\
p_2
&\!\!=\!\!&
\frac{\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}-\alpha_0-\beta_0}{\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}-2\alpha_0},
\label{dif31}
\\
p_3
&\!\!=\!\!&
-\frac{\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}}{\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}-2\alpha_0},
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray} 
which also satisfy Kasner relations~\eqref{dif21}.
The presence of the magnetic field does not influence the asymptotic structure of the metric at $t \to\infty$,
which therefore does not isotropize, unlike the Heckmann-Schucking solution with dust~\cite{Heck-Schuck,Khal-Kam}. The reason for this phenomenon is clear. 
The energy density of the magnetic field at $t \to\infty$ is given by
\begin{equation}\label{dif32}
\frac{B_0^2}{a^2b^2} \simeq \nu\,(\nu-1)\,\frac{\eta_2}{W_2}\,t^{\nu-3},  
\end{equation} 
where $\nu-3 < -2$.
Hence it remains weaker than the anisotropy term. 
\par
Now we can try to understand what happens with the expanding universe in its distant past.
One can suppose that it was born from the initial singularity at $t=0$, when its volume $V(0)=0$
and its time derivative had the smallest critical value, 
\begin{equation}
\dot V(0) = W_3 \equiv -2\alpha_0-\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}>0.
\label{dif33}
\end{equation}
In this case, the scale factors will be of the form in Eq.~\eqref{dif30} with the Kasner exponents
\begin{eqnarray}\label{dif34}
p'_1 
&\!\!=\!\!&
\frac{\alpha_0-\beta_0+\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}}{2\alpha_0+\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}},
\nonumber
\\
p'_2
&\!\!=\!\!&
\frac{\alpha_0+\beta_0+\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}}{2\alpha_0+\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}},
\\
p'_3
&\!\!=\!\!&
\frac{\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}}{2\alpha_0+\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}}.
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray} 
They again satisfy the Kasner relations~\eqref{dif21}.
\par
To establish a relation between the set of Kasner indices at the beginning
and at the end of the evolution, it is convenient to use the
Lifshitz--Khalatnikov parametrization~\cite{Lif-Khal}. 
If the Kasner indices are ordered as 
\begin{equation}
p_1 \leq p_2 \leq p_3,
\label{dif35}
\end{equation}
they can be represented by means of a real parameter $u\geq 1$ according to
\begin{eqnarray}
p_1
&\!\!=\!\!&
-\frac{u}{1+u+u^2}, \nonumber \\
p_2
&\!\!=\!\!&
\frac{1+u}{1+u+u^2},
\label{dif36} \\
p_3
&\!\!=\!\!&
\frac{u\,(1+u)}{1+u+u^2}.
\nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
The ordering~\eqref{dif35} can be obtained, for example, by 
setting the anisotropy parameters
\begin{equation}
\alpha_0 < 0,
\quad
\beta_0 < 0,
\quad
|\beta_0| < \frac35\,|\alpha_0|.
\label{dif37}
\end{equation}
In particular, this choice implies that the universe expands in the $y$ and $z$ directions,
but does so more rapidly along the direction $z$ of the magnetic field, while it contracts along the $x$ axis.
Combining Eqs.~\eqref{dif34} and~\eqref{dif37}, we obtain
\begin{equation}
u' = \frac{p_3'}{p_2'} =
\frac{\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}}{|\alpha_0|+|\beta_0|-\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}}.
\label{dif38}
\end{equation}
It is convenient to introduce the parameter 
\begin{equation}
\xi = \frac{|\beta_0|}{|\alpha_0|},
\end{equation}
which, when plugged into Eq.~\eqref{dif38}, results in the relation
\begin{equation}
\xi = \frac{(u'+1)^2-u'^2}{(u'+1)^2+u'^2}.
\label{dif39}
\end{equation} 
Note that if the parameter $\xi$ satisfies the conditions~\eqref{dif37}, then 
$u'$ satisfies the conditions $1 < u' < \infty$. 
%\begin{equation}\label{dif390} 1 < u' < \infty. \end{equation}
Let us look now at the Kasner exponents~\eqref{dif31} describing the final stage of the cosmological evolution. 
In this case the order of the exponents is 
\begin{equation}
p_3 \leq p_1 \leq p_2.
\label{dif40}
\end{equation}
Correspondingly, we can represent them as 
\begin{eqnarray}
p_1
&\!\!=\!\!&
\frac{1+u}{1+u+u^2}, \label{dif41} \nonumber \\
p_2
&\!\!=\!\!&
\frac{u\,(1+u)}{1+u+u^2}, \\
p_3 
&\!\!=\!\!&
-\frac{u}{1+u+u^2}, \nonumber 
\end{eqnarray}
Thus,
\begin{equation}
u = \frac{p_2}{p_1} =
\frac{\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}-\alpha_0-\beta_0}{\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}-\alpha_0+\beta_0}.
\label{dif42}
\end{equation}
Substituting the formulas~\eqref{dif38} and \eqref{dif39} into the equation above, we find
\begin{equation}
u = \frac{1+u'}{u'} < 2.
\label{dif43}
\end{equation}
Inversely,
\begin{equation}
u' = \frac{1}{u-1}.
\label{dif44}
\end{equation}
For the inverse evolution towards the singularity, as one usually analyses the oscillating approach towards
the cosmological singularity~\cite{BKL,Bel-Hen}, one can see that the universe passes through two
transformations in the transition from the parameter $u$ to the parameter $u'$ according to Eq.~\eqref{dif44}.
The first transformation is characterized by the shift $u \to u-1$, in which the roles of the $x$ and $z$ axes,
corresponding to the exponents $p_1$ and $p_3$, are exchanged.
This transformation is called ``change of the Kasner epoch''~\cite{BKL}.
As a result of this transformation, we arrive at a value of the parameter $u-1<1$, see Eq.~\eqref{dif43}.
The next transformation is defined by $u-1 \to \dfrac{1}{u-1}$,
which exchanges the roles of the axes $y$ and $z$,
and is called  ``change of Kasner era''.
\par
We see that our solution displays a transition between two Kasner regimes
chacterized by the same law which is found in an empty Bianchi-II universe. For a detailed description of the dynamics in the Bianchi-II universe in General Relativity
and other gravity models see Ref.~\cite{Giani-Kam}. In Bianchi-VIII or Bianchi-IX models, the universe passes through an infinite series
of changes of the Kasner epochs and eras.
In our case, for the choice of parameters in Eq.~\eqref{dif37}, the law of the transformation
for the Kasner exponents~\eqref{dif44} includes one change of the Kasner epoch
and one change of the Kasner era. 

We can also consider the opposite relation between the anisotropy parameters, to wit
\begin{equation}
\alpha_0 < 0, \quad \beta_0 < 0,
\quad \frac35\,|\alpha_0| < |\beta_0| < 1,
\label{dif45}
\end{equation}
or, in other words, $\dfrac35 < \xi < 1$. 
%\begin{equation} \frac35 < \xi < 1. \label{dif46} \end{equation}
In this case, we have
\begin{equation}
u' = \frac{p_2'}{p_3'},
\label{dif49}
\end{equation}
which corresponds to
\begin{equation}
\xi = \frac{(u'+1)^2-1}{(u'+1)^2+1},
\label{dif50}
\end{equation}
and $u = u'+1$
%\begin{equation}\label{dif51} u = u'+1,  \end{equation}
or, inversely, $u'=u-1$.
%\begin{equation} u'=u-1. \label{dif52} \end{equation}
The last two relations show that we now have only a change of the Kasner epoch.

\subsection{Exact evolution}
% 
Let us come back to %differential 
Eq.~\eqref{magn33} in the form of
\begin{align}\label{exact}
& \frac{d}{dt}\left(V\,\dot{V}+4\alpha_0\, V\right) = -3\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2, \\ \nonumber
&
\end{align}
%This can be integrated once to yield
%\begin{equation}\label{exact1} V\,\dot{V} +4\alpha_0 V = -\bigl(3\alpha_0^2+\beta_0^2\bigr) t. \end{equation}
which can be integrated and, by defining $V(t) = X(t)\, t$, written as %and defining $V = Xt$, reads 
%\begin{equation}
% t\,\dot{X} + X+4\,\alpha_0+\frac{3\,\alpha_0^2+\beta_0^2}{X}
% =
% 0
% \ ,
% \label{magn45}
% \end{equation}
%or 
\begin{equation} \label{magn46}
\frac{X\,dX}{X^2+4\alpha_0\,X+3\alpha_0^2+\beta_0^2}
= -\frac{dt}{t}.
\end{equation}
Integrating the equation above, we obtain
% \begin{eqnarray}
% &&\frac12\ln[(X+2\alpha_0)^2-(\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2)]\nonumber \\
% &&+\frac{\alpha_0}{\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}}\ln\frac{X+2\alpha_0+\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}}{X+2\alpha_0-\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}}=D-\ln t,
% \label{magn47}
% \end{eqnarray}
% where $D$ is an integration constant. We rewrite the solution \eqref{magn47}
%in a more convenient form introducing a moment $t_0$ when the the function $X$ and, hence, $V$ vanish. Then
\begin{widetext}
\begin{equation}\label{magn48}
\frac12\ln\left(1+\frac{X^2+4\alpha_0X}{3\alpha_0^2+\beta_0^2}\right)
+\frac{\alpha_0}{\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}}
\left[\ln\biggl(1+\frac{X}{2\alpha_0+\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}}\biggr)
- \ln\biggl(1+\frac{X}{2\alpha_0-\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}}\biggr)
\right]
=
\ln\left(\frac{t_0}{t}\right). 
\end{equation}
\end{widetext}
where integration constants are chosen so that $t_0>0$ is the time at which the volume $V$ (hence $X$)
vanishes.
\par
Unfortunately, Eq.~\eqref{magn48} cannot be inverted to find $X$ as a function of $t$.
Thus, we cannot use this equation to find exact expressions for the anisotropy factors.
However, we can use it to study the approach to the singularity for $t\to t_0$ when $X \to 0$.
Expanding the left-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{magn48}, we see that the leading term is proportional to $X^2$, and the equation reduces to 
\begin{equation}\label{magn49}
X^2(t)
\simeq
2\left(3\alpha_0^2 + \beta_0^2 \right)\frac{t_0-t}{t_0}.
\end{equation} 
This implies
\begin{equation}\label{magn50}
V(t) \simeq \sqrt{2\bigl(3\alpha_0^2 + \beta_0^2 \bigr)t_0\,(t_0-t)} \end{equation}
and 
\begin{equation}\label{magn50}
\dot{V} \simeq -\sqrt{\frac{\bigl(3\alpha_0^2 + \beta_0^2 \bigr)t_0}{2(t_0-t)}} \to -\infty,
\end{equation}
which obviously breaks the inequality~\eqref{magn41}.
The solution~\eqref{magn49} therefore corresponds to initial conditions
which are incompatible with the the existence of a homogenous
magnetic field. 
\par
However, the solution~\eqref{magn48} admits a different regime corresponding
to a volume singularity given by $t \to 0$ with $X(0)$ finite.
To describe this regime, one can confront the terms proportional to $\ln t$ in the
left-hand side and the right-hand side of Eq.~\eqref{magn48}.
In this case, the function $X(t)$ tends to a positive constant which can be found
from a quadratic equation and corresponds to the extremal points of the
inequality~\eqref{magn41}. 
Thus, the regime of the approach to the singularity described above is compatible
with the general solution of Eq.~\eqref{exact} and arises in the vicinity of the point
$t = 0$.

\section{Bianchi-I models with magnetic field and additional perfect fluids}
%
\label{s:BianchiIBF}
%
% 
In the previous section, we analysed cosmological models just sourced by
a magnetic field. 
Now, we will briefly consider two models in which we add dust and a massless scalar field (stiff matter), respectively.
% 
%
\subsection{Model with dust}
%
The energy density of dust is 
\begin{equation}
\rho %= \frac{\rho_0}{abc} 
= \frac{\rho_0}{R^3}, 
%= \frac{\rho_0}{V},
\label{magn-dust} \end{equation} 
where $\rho_0$ is a positive constant.
It follows immediately from the Einstein equations that the scalar curvature
in the presence of dust is
\begin{equation}
{\cal R} = -\rho.
\label{magn-dust1}
\end{equation} 
It is easy to see that Eq.~\eqref{magn19} does not changed in the presence of dust and the anisotropy function $\beta$ is still given by Eq.~\eqref{magn20}.
Eq.~\eqref{magn23} instead changes because the scalar curvature does not vanish, see Eq.~\eqref{magn-dust1}, and reads
\begin{eqnarray}\label{magn-dust2}
R_{\ 1}^1+R_{\ 2}^2+2\,R_{\ 3}^3
&\!\!=\!\!&
-4 \frac{\ddot{R}}{R}-8\frac{\dot{R}^2}{R^2}+6\dot{\alpha} \frac{\dot{R}}{R}+2\ddot{\alpha}
\nonumber \\
&\!\!=\!\!&
2{\cal R} = - \frac{2\rho_0}{R^3}. 
\end{eqnarray}
This equation can be rewritten as
\begin{equation}\label{magn-dust3}
\frac{d}{dt}\left(\dot{\alpha}R^3\right)
= \frac23\frac{d^2R^3}{dt^2}-\rho_0,
\end{equation}
which yields
\begin{equation}\label{magn-dust4}
\dot{\alpha} = 2 \frac{\dot{R}}{R}-\frac{\rho_0 t}{R^3} +\frac{\alpha_0}{R^3}. \end{equation}
Eqs.~\eqref{magn21} and \eqref{magn22} are still valid and we obtain 
\begin{equation}
\frac{B_0^2}{R^4}\, \e^{-4\alpha}
= \frac{1}{R^3}\,\frac{d^2R^3}{dt^2}-\frac{\rho_0}{R^3},
\label{magn-dust5}
\end{equation}
which implies
\begin{equation}
\frac{d^2R^3}{dt^2} > \rho_0. 
\label{magn-dust6}
\end{equation}
By performing the analysis as in the case without dust,
we obtain the equation for the volume variable 
%\begin{eqnarray}
\begin{equation}\label{magn-dust7} \begin{split}
V\,\ddot{V} =
%&\!\!=\!\!&
& -\dot{V}^2 + 4\bigl(\rho_0t-\alpha_0\bigr)\dot{V}
-3\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2
%\nonumber \\ &&
\\ & + \, 3\rho_0
\bigl(2\alpha_0-\rho_0 t\bigr)t,
\end{split} \end{equation} %\end{eqnarray}
which we cannot solve exactly.
\par
An axisymmetric solution is known in the literature~\cite{Dorosh,Shikin,Thorne},
corresponding to $\beta_0 = 0$, which is rather cumbersome and implicit.
Thus, we shall just undertake a simple qualitative analysis of Eq.~\eqref{magn-dust7}. 
One can see that, when the universe approaches the singularity $V=R^3=0$, the terms proportional to $\rho_0$ in Eq.~\eqref{magn-dust7} become negligible, and we come back to the situation where the dust was absent.
Thus, we have a Kasner type of singularity with a positive Kasner exponent corresponding to the axis along which the magnetic field is directed.
When the volume of the universe grows towards infinity, we encounter the opposite situation.
The term $3\rho_0 t^2$ dominates since $V(t) \sim t^2$, and we have isoptropization just like in the standard Heckmann-Schucking solution.
% 
%
%
%
\subsection{Model with massless scalar field}
%
%
Let us consider the Bianchi-I universe filled with the magnetic field as in the preceding
sections and a homogeneous massless scalar field, $\phi=\phi(t)$.
For a massless scalar field, the pressure equals the energy density and the perfect fluid
with such an equation of state is called stiff matter.
The Klein-Gordon equation for $\phi$ in the Bianchi-I universe has the form
\begin{equation}
\ddot{\phi}+3\,\frac{\dot{R}}{R}\,\dot{\phi} = 0,
\label{KG}
\end{equation}
whose general solution is given by 
\begin{equation}
\dot{\phi} = \frac{\tilde{\phi}_0}{R^3}
= \frac{\tilde{\phi}_0}{V},
\label{KG1} \end{equation}
where $\tilde{\phi}_0$ is a constant.
One can see that $\dot\phi$ behaves in the same way as the time derivative of the anisotropy factor $\beta$. It is convenient to rescale $\tilde{\phi}_0=\sqrt{2}\,\phi_0$, so that the scalar field energy-momentum tensor reads
\begin{equation}
T_{\ 0}^0 = -T_{\ 1}^1 = -T_{\ 2}^2 = -T_{\ 3}^3 = \frac{\phi_0^2}{V^2},
\label{KG2}
\end{equation}
while the scalar curvature reads
\begin{equation}
{\cal R} = \frac{2\phi_0^2}{V^2} .
\label{KG3}
\end{equation}
Obviously, the presence of $\phi$ does not change Eqs.~\eqref{magn21} and \eqref{magn22}.
Moreover, due to the special form of the spatial components in Eq.~\eqref{KG2} and
\eqref{KG3}, Eq.~\eqref{magn23} also does not change its form.
Therefore, the results in Eqs.~\eqref{magn28} and \eqref{magn29} still hold.
However, the scalar field contributes to the $00$ component of the Einstein equations~\eqref{Ein}.
From Eq.~\eqref{KG2}, we see that $\phi_0$ enters the equation for the volume~\eqref{magn33}
on an equal footing with the parameter $\beta_0$.
Thus, the new equation for $V$ is given by
\begin{equation}
V\,\ddot{V}+\dot{V}^2+4\alpha_0\,\dot{V}+3\alpha_0^2+\beta_0^2+\phi_0^2 = 0.
\label{KG5}
\end{equation}
That means that we can use the formulas in Sec.~\ref{s:BianchiIB} with $\beta_0^2$
replaced by $\beta_0^2+\phi_0^2$.
\par
There is no need to rewrite all of the formulas from Sec.~\ref{s:BianchiIB} explicitly,
but we just focus on the expressions for the scale factors for the expanding universe
in the vicinity of the singularity.
By expanding around $t=0$, we obtain the Kasner form~\eqref{dif30} with
\begin{eqnarray}
p_1
&\!\!=\!\!&
\frac{\alpha_0-\beta_0+\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2-\phi_0^2}}{2\alpha_0+\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2-\phi_0^2}}, \nonumber \\
p_2
&\!\!=\!\!&
\frac{\alpha_0+\beta_0+\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2-\phi_0^2}}{2\alpha_0+\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2-\phi_0^2}},
\label{KG7} \\ p_3
&\!\!=\!\!&
-\frac{\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2-\phi_0^2}}{2\alpha_0+\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2-\phi_0^2}}, \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where we have chosen $\alpha_0 < 0$ and $\beta_0 \leq 0$.
It is well known~\cite{Bel-Khal} that the presence of the massless scalar field changes the
relations for the Kasner exponents.
While they still satisfy
\begin{equation}
p_1+p_2+p_3 = 1,
\label{KG8}
\end{equation}
the sum of their squares is smaller then one.
Namely, using the formulas~\eqref{KG7}, we obtain
\begin{equation}
p_1^2+p_2^2+p_3^2 = 1-q^2,
\label{KG9} \end{equation}
with the parameter 
\begin{equation}
q^2 = \frac{2\phi_0^2}{4\alpha_0^2+4\alpha_0\,\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2-\phi_0^2}+\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2-\phi_0^2}
\label{KG10} \end{equation}
satisfying the inequalities
\begin{equation}
0 \leq q^2 < \frac12.
\label{KG11} \end{equation}
It is worth noting that, in the case of a universe filled only with the massless scalar field, the parameter $q^2$
must satisfy the less stringent bounds~\cite{Bel-Khal}:
\begin{equation}
0 \leq q^2 \leq \frac23.
\label{KG12}
\end{equation}
One can grasp where the root of the difference lies between Eqs.~\eqref{KG11} and \eqref{KG12}.
The parameter $q^2$ indicates some kind of isotropization for the universe.
The limiting value $q^2 = 2/3$ in Eq.~\eqref{KG12} means that $p_1=p_2=p_3=1/3$,
i.e., that the expansion of the universe is totally isotropic.
The presence of a magnetic field in the $z$ direction makes such a high degree of
isotropization impossible, which is then reflected in Eq.~\eqref{KG11}. 
\par
Finally, the Kasner exponents for the universe when its volume tends to infinity are given by
\begin{eqnarray}
p'_1
&\!\!=\!\!&
\frac{\alpha_0-\beta_0-\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2-\phi_0^2}}{2\alpha_0-\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2-\phi_0^2}},
\nonumber \\ p'_2
&\!\!=\!\!&
\frac{\alpha_0+\beta_0-\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2-\phi_0^2}}{2\alpha_0-\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2-\phi_0^2}},
\label{KG13}
\\ p'_3
&\!\!=\!\!&
\frac{\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2-\phi_0^2}}{2\alpha_0-\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2-\phi_0^2}},
\nonumber \end{eqnarray}
so that 
\begin{equation}
(p'_1)^2+(p'_2)^2+(p'_3)^2 = 1-(q')^2,
\label{KG14}
\end{equation}
where 
\begin{equation}\label{KG15} \begin{split}
(q')^2 & =
\frac{2\phi_0^2}{4\alpha_0^2-4\alpha_0\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2-\phi_0^2}+\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2-\phi_0^2} \\ & < q^2.
\end{split} \end{equation}
The value of $q^2$ therefore decreases, going from the singularity towards an infinite expansion, and the degree of anisotropy increases, in contrast to the isotropization induced by the presence of dust in the Heckmann-Schucking solution.
This effect was noticed in the study of the anisotropic universe only with the scalar field~\cite{Bel-Khal,Khal-Kam}.

\section{Singularities and their crossing} \label{s:sing}
%
% 
The existence of singularities in cosmological models has attracted the attention of
researchers working in General Relativity and its modifications for a long time. 
In fact, the question of the initial singularity was already discussed
in the seminal paper by Robertson~\cite{Robertson}, where the early
development of Friedmann-type cosmologies was reviewed and generalized.
The connection between the presence and sign of the spatial curvature,
the value of the cosmological constant, and the dependence of the pressure
on the scale factor of the universe were studied there in detail with regard
to the appearance of a singularity.
It is interesting that Robertson also considered the scenario of a cyclic evolution,
described by some trigonometric law, in which the universe emerges from a singularity,
expands to the maximum value of its radius, then contracts back, and the process repeats itself indefinitely.  
It appears that the fact that the universe goes through this singularity
did not disturb him too much.
Another type of cosmological singularity, which can arise in the future
for some finite values of the scale factor of the universe and can be rather
soft, was described in Ref.~\cite{Barrow-soft}.
The interest in such singularities essentially increased during the last few
years (see, e.g., the review~\cite{my-review} and references therein).
\par
In contrast with the crossing of soft singularities, the idea of crossing the Big~Bang--Big~Crunch
singularity appears rather counter-intuitive.
For many years, the desire to look for models free of such singularities dominated,
although the idea of the possible transition from the Big Crunch to the Big~Bang was studied in some cosmological models.
First of all, we would like to mention the string or pre-Big Bang scenario~\cite{Gasp-Ven,Lidsey,Gasp-Ven1}.
It is important to note that in this framework, not only isotropic Friedmann models,
but also anisotropic Bianchi-I models~\cite{Copeland,Copeland1} were studied.
In these works, the universe was filled with dilaton supplemented by an antisymmetric tensor field, which influenced its dynamics.
Another approach to the problem of the singularity, also inspired by superstring theories, was developed
in Refs.~\cite{Khoury,Khoury1,Khoury2}.
In Ref.~\cite{Khoury1}, the authors treated the singularity as the transition between
a contracting Big Crunch phase and an expanding Big Bang phase.
A crucial role in their analysis was played by a massless scalar field, a modulus.
The theory was reformulated in such a way as to define variables that remain finite as the scale factor shrinks to zero.
That suggests a natural way to match the solutions before and after the singularity.
The general features of the approach in Refs.~\cite{Khoury,Khoury1,Khoury2}
are the role played by the scalar field and the construction of variables which are finite 
at the singularity crossing.
These features are also essential for the approach developed in Refs.~\cite{KPTVV-sing,we-Bianchi,we-Bianchi1,we-KS}. 
\par
Recently, other approaches to the problem of the description of such a crossing
were elaborated in Refs.~\cite{Bars,Bars1,Wetterich,Wetterich1,Prester,Prester1,Mercati,Mercati1}.
Behind these approaches are basically two general ideas.
Firstly, to cross the singularity, one must give a prescription matching non-singular,
finite quantities before and after such a crossing.
Secondly, such a description can be achieved by using a convenient choice of
field parametrizations. 
In Ref.~\cite{KPTVV-sing}, a version of the description of the crossing of singularities
in universes filled with scalar fields was elaborated based on the transition between the Jordan and the Einstein frames.
The main idea of Ref.~\cite{KPTVV-sing} was the following:
when in the Einstein frame the universe arrives at the Big Bang{--}Big Crunch singularity, from the point of view of
the evolution of its counterpart in the Jordan frame, its geometry is regular, but the effective Planck mass is zero.
The solution to the equations of motion in the Jordan frame is smooth at this point,
and using the relations between the solutions of the cosmological equations
in the two frames, one can describe the crossing of the cosmological singularity
in a uniquely determined way.
In Ref.~\cite{Starobinsky1981}, it was pointed out that in a homogeneous and isotropic universe,
one can indeed cross the point where the effective gravitational constant changes sign. 
However, the presence of anisotropies or inhomogeneities changes the situation
drastically because when the value of the effective Planck mass tends to zero,
hence the effective gravitational constant diverges, these anisotropies and
inhomogeneities grow indefinitely.
In Ref.~\cite{we-Bianchi}, the authors investigated this phenomenon, suggesting a simple field
reparametrization that allows one to describe the Big Bang{--}Big Crunch singularity crossing
in the Bianchi-I model filled with a minimally coupled scalar field.
Further studies of the description of the Big Bang--Big Crunch singularity
crossing in anisotropic models were undertaken in Refs.~\cite{we-Bianchi1,we-KS}. 
An attempt to develop a general approach to the problem of the treatment
of the singularities in classical and quantum cosmology based on the
reparmetrizations in the field space was also undertaken in Refs.~\cite{Ibere,Ibere1,Ibere2}.   
\par
Taking into account all of the above, we shall try to describe what happens with
our solution when the Bianchi-I universe filled with a magnetic field encounters
the singularity. 
Let us  tackle the problem by studying the behaviour of the differential equations
``behind the singularity'', where these equations and their solutions remain
mathematically well defined but variables can take on a different meaning from
their original one.
For example, the variable $V$, defined as a volume, can become negative.
Let us come back to Eq.~\eqref{magn40}, describing the contraction of the universe
when the parameter $\alpha_0$ is positive. 
We have seen that such a universe reaches $V(t_1)=0$ when the velocity of the
contraction $\dot V(t_1)=-W_1=-2\alpha_0+\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}$.
If we continue the solution for $t > t_1$, the variable $V$ becomes negative,
its time derivative remains negative, and it does not satisfy the inequality~\eqref{magn41}.
It follows from Eq.~\eqref{magn40} that the second derivative $\ddot{V}$ remains
positive.
Thus, the variable $V$ undergoes some kind of ``negative expansion'' for a period of
time during which it remains negative, while its absolute value grows.
Since $\ddot{V}>0$, at some moment, say $t=t_3$, the time derivative passes
through the value $\dot{V}(t_3)=0$ and becomes positive.
Correspondingly, the function  $V=V(t)$ also starts to increase
(its absolute value is decreasing, so we can speak about ``negative contraction'').
At a later moment $t=t_4$, the volume $V$ should vanish.
However, the velocity $\dot{V}>0$ and we cannot enter into the interval~\eqref{magn41}
if the parameter $\alpha_0$ is positive, hence the critical
$-W_1=-2\alpha_0+\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}$ is negative.
This implies that we encounter a singularity of another type when $V \sim \sqrt{t_4-t}$,
which we have described before.
And it is impossible to cross this singularity coming back to the ``normal'' part of the
phase space $(V,\dot{V})$ of our problem, where we were before the first encounter
with the singularity and where the magnetic field was well defined. 
\par
Nevertheless, a nice way to come back to the ``normal universe'' after this journey
behind the ``looking glass'' still exists.
It consists of a simple prescription: we can change the sign of the constant $\alpha_0$.
The reasonable moment for this change is exactly at $t=t_3$, because the parameter
$\alpha_0$ enters into Eq.~\eqref{magn40} either squared or multiplied by $\dot{V}$
and the velocity $\dot{V}(t_3)=0$.
To keep the parameters $\alpha_0$ and $\beta_0$ on equal footing, we can change
the sign of the parameter $\beta_0$ as well. 
After that, the universe goes towards the singularity, where $V(t_4) = 0$,
$\dot{V}(t_4)=W_3=-2\alpha_0-\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2} > 0$, and crosses into
the ``normal'' part of the phase space expanding. 
\par
Now, it is interesting to compare the anisotropy parameters of the universe before
it hits the singularity and after it jumps out of it.
Using the formula~\eqref{dif10}, we found the expressions~\eqref{dif19}-\eqref{dif20}
for the scale factors $a(t)$, $b(t)$ and $c(t)$, when the universe is contracting towards
the singularity at $t=t_2$.
Let us choose
\begin{equation}
\beta_0 =\xi \, \alpha_0, \qquad 
\label{dif53}
%\end{equation} where  \begin{equation}
0 \leq \xi \leq \frac35.
%\label{dif54}
\end{equation}
In this case, $p_3 > p_2$ %in Eq.~\eqref{dif55} 
and 
\begin{equation}
u = \frac{\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}}{\alpha_0+\beta_0-\sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}},
\label{dif55}
\end{equation}
so $\xi$ is
%\begin{equation} \xi = \frac{(u+1)^2-u^2}{(u+1)^2+u^2}, \label{dif56} \end{equation}
just like in Eq.~\eqref{dif39}. 
Simple calculations then show that the Kasner indices of the universe that go out from
the region behind the singularity coincide with those it had before the
encounter with the singularity.
It is not clear how we can interpret the period of time that the universe has spent behind the singularity. 
\par
One can suggest another way to describe the transition through the singularity.
The Einstein equations for our system are invariant under a change in the sign
of the scale factors.
Indeed, these equations only contain terms like ${\ddot{a}}/{a}$, 
${\dot{a}}/{a}$ or $a^2$.
Thus, we can change the signs of all three scale factors so that the volume becomes positive again.
To make the equation~\eqref{magn40} for the volume invariant with respect to
the change of sign of $V$, we should also change the sign of the parameter $\alpha_0$.
In this way, the positive time derivative of the volume $\dot{V}$ immediately acquires
a lower critical value $2|\alpha_0| - \sqrt{\alpha_0^2-\beta_0^2}$ and an unlimited expansion begins.  
\par
Both prescriptions described above imply the same evolution after the singular
bounce, but these two bounces have a slightly different origin.

\section{Concluding remarks}
%
\label{s:conc}
%
% 
We have studied in detail some features of the Bianchi-I universe filled with a spatially homogeneous magnetic field.
Here we would like to briefly mention other recent works in which different aspects of the Bianchi-I geometry were studied.
First of all, let us note that the role of the time coordinate and of one of the spatial
coordinates in the expression for the metric~\eqref{Bianchi-I} can be
exchanged~\cite{Land-Lif}.
This possibility was already considered in the earliest works~\cite{Kasner,Weyl,Levi-Civita}
and the study of the spatial Kasner-like geometries (in particular, in the presence of thin or thick walls or slabs) still attracts researchers~\cite{Amundsen,Fulling0,Fulling,Kam-Vard,Kam-Vard1}.   
The study of geodesics in the Kasner universe was presented in Ref.~\cite{Harvey}.
Applications of Kasner-type spacetimes to cosmic jets were done in Refs.~\cite{Mashhoon,Mashhoon1},
and the behavior of fields and particles with spin in Bianchi-I universes was studied~\cite{Saha,Kam-Ter}.
In recent papers~\cite{Parnovsky,Parnovsky1}, the comparison of the Bianchi-I geometry
with the real very early universe and our late time universe was undertaken,
while Ref.~\cite{Horn} was devoted to the study of Horndeski gravity in the Bianchi-I universe.
Thus, the study of the simplest non-isotropic cosmological models still flourishes
and can bring surprises.
