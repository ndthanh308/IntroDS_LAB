\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:hybrid_augment_conclusion}
In this paper, inspired by the frequency-centric explanations of how CNNs generalize, we propose two augmentations methods \textit{HybridAugment} and \textit{HybridAugment++}. The former aims to reduce the reliance of CNN generalization on high-frequency information in images, whereas the latter does the same but also promotes the use of phase information rather than the amplitude component. This unification of two distinct frequency-based analyses into a data augmentation method leads to results competitive to or better than state-of-the-art on clean accuracy, corruption and adversarial performance and out-of-distribution detection.
