%%%%%%%%% ABSTRACT
\begin{abstract}
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are known to exhibit poor generalization performance under distribution shifts. Their generalization have been studied extensively, and one line of work approaches the problem from a frequency-centric perspective. These studies highlight the fact that humans and CNNs might focus on different frequency components of an image. First, inspired by these observations, we propose a simple yet effective data augmentation method \textit{HybridAugment} that reduces the reliance of CNNs on high-frequency components, and thus improves their robustness while keeping their clean accuracy high. Second, we propose \textit{HybridAugment++}, which is a hierarchical augmentation method that attempts to unify various frequency-spectrum augmentations. \textit{HybridAugment++} builds on \textit{HybridAugment}, and also reduces the reliance of CNNs on the amplitude component of images, and promotes phase information instead. This unification results in competitive to or better than state-of-the-art results on clean accuracy (CIFAR-10/100 and ImageNet), corruption benchmarks (ImageNet-C, CIFAR-10-C and CIFAR-100-C), adversarial robustness on CIFAR-10 and out-of-distribution detection on various datasets. \textit{HybridAugment} and \textit{HybridAugment++} are implemented in a few lines of code, does not require extra data, ensemble models or additional networks \footnote{Our code is available at \url{https://github.com/MKYucel/hybrid_augment}.}.
