\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we describe the Co-Attention Graph Pooling (CAGPool) method for processing pairs of graph-structured data in an efficient and effective way. 
CAGPool combines the co-attention mechanism and pooling by node selection to enable a graph neural network to identify important sub-graphs for prediction tasks while maintaining the computational simplicity of Siamese networks. 
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on two real-world benchmark datasets, showing that it outperforms baselines even without using additional information commonly utilized by other methods. 
We believe that CAGPool has the potential to be beneficial in a wide range of applications, including the urgent development of COVID-19 treatments, where the ability to identify key sub-graphs in paired data can help prevent unintended side effects.
