  "abstract": "In this paper I will unite two games,\n  symplectic billiards and tiling billiards. The new\n  game is called symplectic tiling billiards.\n  I will prove a result about periodic orbits of\n  symplectic tiling billiards in a\n  very special case and then show how this result\n  combines with the construction in\n  Thurston's paper {\\it Shapes of Polyhedra\\/} to\n  give hyperbolic structures on moduli spaces\n  of planar equilateral polygons. One corollary\n  is that the configuration space of the hexagonal\n  planar linkage with unit-length rods (modulo\n  isometry) has an\n  algebraically defined hyperbolic structure in which\n  it is a $10$-cusped hyperbolic $3$-manifold\n  that is tiled by $15$ regular ideal octahedra.\n  The $10$ cusps correspond to the $10$ maximally degenerate\n  configurations.",
