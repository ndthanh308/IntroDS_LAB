        abstract = {By releasing this dataset, we aim at providing a new testbed for computer vision techniques using Deep Learning. The main peculiarity is the shift from the domain of "natural images" proper of common benchmark dataset to biological imaging. We anticipate that the advantages of doing so could be two-fold: i) fostering research in biomedical-related fields - for which popular pre-trained models perform typically poorly - and ii) promoting methodological research in deep learning by addressing peculiar requirements of these images. Possible applications include but are not limited to semantic segmentation, object detection and object counting.
        The data consist of 283 high-resolution pictures (1600x1200 pixels) of mice brain slices acquired through a fluorescence microscope. The final goal is to individuate and count neurons highlighted in the pictures by means of a marker, so to assess the result of a biological experiment. For more information, please refer to Hitrec, T. et al. 2019. Neural control of fasting-induced torpor in mice. Scientific reports, 9(1), pp.1-12.
        The corresponding ground-truth labels were generated through a hybrid approach involving semi-automatic and manual semantic segmentation. The result consists of black (0) and white (255) images having pixel-level annotations of where the neurons are located.
        The collection of original images was supported by funding from the University of Bologna (RFO 2018) and the European Space Agency (Research agreement collaboration 4000123556).},

abstract = {{Counting cells in fluorescent microscopy is a tedious, time-consuming task that researchers have to accomplish to assess the effects of different experimental conditions on biological structures of interest. Although such objects are generally easy to identify, the process of manually annotating cells is sometimes subject to fatigue errors and suffers from arbitrariness due to the operator’s interpretation of the borderline cases. We propose a Deep Learning approach that exploits a fully-convolutional network in a binary segmentation fashion to localize the objects of interest. Counts are then retrieved as the number of detected items. Specifically, we introduce a Unet-like architecture, cell ResUnet (c-ResUnet), and compare its performance against 3 similar architectures. In addition, we evaluate through ablation studies the impact of two design choices, (i) artifacts oversampling and (ii) weight maps that penalize the errors on cells boundaries increasingly with overcrowding. In summary, the c-ResUnet outperforms the competitors with respect to both detection and counting metrics (respectively, F1 score = 0.81 and MAE = 3.09). Also, the introduction of weight maps contribute to enhance performances, especially in presence of clumping cells, artifacts and confounding biological structures. Posterior qualitative assessment by domain experts corroborates previous results, suggesting human-level performance inasmuch even erroneous predictions seem to fall within the limits of operator interpretation. Finally, we release the pre-trained model and the annotated dataset to foster research in this and related fields.}},
