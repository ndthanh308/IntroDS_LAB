  "abstract": "Recent JWST observations of the z=10.6 galaxy GN-z11 have revealed a very high gas-phase nitrogen abundance (higher than four times the solar value), a very small half-light radius(~ 60 pc), and a large stellar mass (M_s ~ 10^9 M_sun) for its size. We consider that this object is a forming galactic nucleus or ultra-compact dwarf galaxy rather than a proto globular cluster, and thereby investigate the chemical abundance pattern using one-zone chemical evolution models.The principal results of the models are as follows. The observed log (N/O) > -0.24, log (C/O)>-0.78, and 12+log (O/H) ~ 7.8 can be self-consistently reproduced by the models both with very short star formation timescales (< 10^7 yr) and with top-heavy stellar initial mass functions (IMFs). The adopted assumption of no chemical enrichment by massive (m>25 M_sun) core collapse supernovae (CCSNe) is also important for the reproduction of high gas-phase log (N/O), because such CCSNe can decrease high log (N/O) of gas polluted by OB and Wolf-Rayet stars. GN-z11 can have a significant fraction (>0.5) of nitrogen-rich ([N/Fe]>0.5) stars, which implies a possible link between nitrogen-rich stellar populations of the inner Galaxy and giant elliptical galaxies and high-z objects with high gas-phase log (N/O) like GN-z11.",
