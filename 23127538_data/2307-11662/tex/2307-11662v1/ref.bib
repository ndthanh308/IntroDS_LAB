This paper first analyzes the technical principles of blockchain and the deficiencies of online teaching and cross regional teaching in cultural and creative design education, and then applies blockchain technology in learning resource management, learning process tracking, learning evaluation, learning path shaping, teaching management and assessment. It is concluded that blockchain technology can effectively optimize the teaching structure and teaching management of cultural and creative design education, and promote the design education field to adapt to the contemporary development. Finally, it puts forward the future prospects.}, number={04}, journal={International Journal of Emerging Technologies in Learning (iJET)}, author={Liu, Jun and Zhu, Tiejun}, year={2021}, month={Feb.}, pages={pp. 228–239} }
