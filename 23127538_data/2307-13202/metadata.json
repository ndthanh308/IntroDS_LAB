  "abstract": "Entropic uncertainty relations demonstrate the intrinsic uncertainty of nature from an information-theory perspective. Recently, a quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relation for multiple measurements was proposed by Wu $et\\ al.$ [Phys Rev A. 106. 062219 (2022)]. Interestingly, the quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relation for multiple measurement settings can be further generalized. In this work, we propose two complementary multipartite quantum-memory-assisted entropic uncertainty relations and our lower bounds depend on values of complementarity of the observables, (conditional) von-Neumann entropies, Holevo quantities, and mutual information. As an illustration, we provide several typical cases to exhibit that our bounds are tighter and outperform the previous bounds.",
