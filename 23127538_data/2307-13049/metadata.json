  "abstract": "In this work, we present an Opto-Electro-Mechanical Modulator (OEMM) for RF-to-optical transduction realized via an ultra-coherent nanomembrane resonator capacitively coupled to an rf injection circuit made of a microfabricated read-out able to improve the electro-optomechanical interaction. This device configuration can be embedded in a Fabry-Perot cavity for electromagnetic cooling of the LC circuit in a dilution refrigerator exploiting the opto-electro-mechanical interaction. To this aim, an optically measured steady-state frequency shift of 380 Hz was seen with a polarization voltage of 30 V and a $Q$-factor of the assembled device above $10^6$ at room temperature. The rf-sputtered titanium nitride layer can be made superconductive to develop efficient quantum~transducers.",
