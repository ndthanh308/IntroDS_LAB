  "abstract": "We provide direct evidence of the effects of interface engineering of various substrates by Microbubble lithography (MBL). We choose a model organic plastic (or polymer) poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), with conductivity of 140 S/cm, as a representative organic system to showcase our technique. Thus, we fabricate permanent patterns of PEDOT:PSS on glass, followed by a flexible PDMS substrate, and observe conductivity enhancement of 5 times on the former (694 S/cm), and 20 times (2844 S/cm) on the latter, without the use of external doping agents or invasive chemical treatment. Probing the patterned interface, we observe that MBL is able to tune the conformational states of PEDOT:PSS from coils in the pristine form, to extended coils on glass, and almost linear structures in PDMS due to its more malleable liquid-like interface. This results in higher ordering and vanishing grain boundaries leading to the highest conductivity of PEDOT:PSS on PDMS substrates.",
