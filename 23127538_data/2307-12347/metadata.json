  "abstract": "We combine mid-infrared diagnostics obtained from integral-field unit observations taken with MIRI/MRS on JWST with cold molecular gas information derived from ALMA observations of CO(1-0) emission to investigate the star formation rate and efficiency within the central $\\sim$ 1.5 kpc$\\times$1.3 kpc region of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 7469 on $\\sim$ 100 pc scales. The active nucleus leaves a notable imprint on its immediate surroundings by elevating the temperature of the warm molecular gas, driving an ionized gas outflow on sub-kpc scales, and selectively destroying small dust grains. These effects, nevertheless, have relatively little impact on the cold circumnuclear medium or its ability to form stars. Most of the star formation in NGC 7469 is confined to a clumpy starburst ring, but the star formation efficiency remains quite elevated even for the nuclear region that is most affected by the active nucleus.",
