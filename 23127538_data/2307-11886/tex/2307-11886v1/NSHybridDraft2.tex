\section{Introduction}

Neutron matter at densities present in the cores of neutron stars is
difficult to study for two reasons: first of all, nucleons at low
energy are described dominantly by the strong force, which is hard to
tackle due to the nonperturbativity of QCD at strong coupling.
The other reason making the study difficult, is that phenomenological
models that can capture nuclear physics at low densities are
practically impossible to extract reliably to large densities due to
the bottom-up approach of such models with a large number of effective
couplings that all, in principle, depend on the density.
Although perturbative QCD at extremely large densities is able to
predict reliably an equation of state \cite{Kurkela:2009gj}, such
densities are orders of magnitudes larger than what is needed for
neutron stars (and possibly so large that matter prefers to collapse
into black holes). 

Holographic QCD models are currently the best suited tools to provide
predictions for nuclear matter at such intermediate, but large,
densities, and hence are advantageous, at least in the large density
region, for computing the equation of state of matter.
Holographic QCD models are a branch of AdS/CFT models after Maldacena
\cite{Maldacena:1997re} and Witten's work \cite{Witten:1998zw} which
are focused on the strong sector, viz.~Quantum Chromodynamics and they
come generally in two kinds: 
top-down models derived from string theory constructions, or bottom-up
models attempting to mimic the strong gluodynamics of QCD with an
appropriate 5-dimensional curved background.
In this work, we shall concentrate on the top-down model known as the
Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto (WSS) model \cite{Witten:1998zw,Sakai:2004cn,Sakai:2005yt},
which is especially predictive 
because it contains only two adjustable parameters, the Kaluza-Klein
scale ($M_{\rm KK}$) and the 't Hooft coupling $\lambda=g^2N_c$.
Usually these parameters are fitted to the meson sector of the theory,
reproducing the pion decay constant and the rho-meson mass
\cite{Sakai:2004cn}. 
In this paper, we shall employ a different calibration of the model,
which we will justify by the fact that we are working exclusively with
baryons, see below for more discussion on the justification.

Holographic QCD models have been employed earlier in the literature in
order to describe neutron stars, in the WSS model
with taking the symmetry energy into account \cite{Kovensky:2021kzl},
in V-QCD \cite{Demircik:2022uol} which is a highly customized
phenomenological version of holographic QCD based on the Veneziano
limit -- i.e.~the limit of a large number of color as well as a large
number of quark flavors, in a D3/D7 model
\cite{BitaghsirFadafan:2019ofb,BitaghsirFadafan:2020otb}, as 
well as in a hard-wall model \cite{Bartolini:2022rkl} (see Ref.~\cite{Jarvinen:2021jbd} for a review on the topic).
Baryons in the WSS model are instantons in the 4-dimensional subspace
spanned by the spatial and holographic directions of the 5-dimensional
curved AdS-like spacetime and are initially best understood via the
BPST flat-instanton approximation \cite{Hata:2007mb}, which is later
shown to be valid only in the large 't Hooft coupling limit
\cite{Bolognesi:2013nja}.
In the context of neutron stars it was shown that the instanton in the
pointlike approximation fails to describe tidal deformabilities and
baryon masses at the same time \cite{Zhang:2019tqd}.
Using instead the homogeneous Ansatz for nuclear matter has previously
been quite successful in describing neutron stars, at least barring
changing the meson fit of the WSS model to one more appropriate for
baryonic matter at finite densities \cite{Kovensky:2021kzl}.
Although the work \cite{Kovensky:2021kzl} holographically takes the
symmetry energy \cite{Kovensky:2021ddl}, charge neutrality 
and $\beta$-equilibrium into account and dynamically determines the
crust of the star, their approach has been plagued with
unrealistically large symmetry energies, a factor of 30 bigger than
its phenomenological value, which in turn shows up as large deviations
of physical neutron stars with respect to isospin symmetric neutron
stars, for example in the mass-radius data.

In a recent paper \cite{Bartolini:2022gdf}, the present authors have
employed a conceptually simpler approach to computing the symmetry
energy in the WSS model in the approximation of using the homogeneous Ansatz
and have shown that it can obtain realistic values, if the model is
calibrated with a smaller Kaluza-Klein scale and a larger 't Hooft
coupling, than the usual meson fit.
Not only is the WSS model able to reproduce the $\sim32$MeV symmetry
energy at saturation density, but the slope and second derivatives of
the symmetry energy as a function of the density can be made to be
consistent with all current experimental constraints -- coming both
from nuclear physics as well as from neutron star data.
In this paper, we use this result of a realistic symmetry energy as a
function of the density and to ensure this is the case, we choose to
bootstrap the model by setting the saturation energy to the physically
accepted one ($\sim0.15\fm^{-3}$), which fixes the Kaluza-Klein scale
and then adjust the 't Hooft coupling to obtain the correct value of
the symmetry energy at saturation density.
It turns out that this calibration scheme gives values of the
couplings very close to
those for which the symmetry energy passes all current experimental
bounds as a function of the density.
As the final ingredient in obtaining realistic neutron stars, requiring a
physical equation of state from very low to very high (medium)
densities, we take the hybrid approach in this paper, by
patching/gluing a very reliable equation of state from nuclear physics
at low densities together with our equation of state obtained from the
WSS model in our calibration.

This paper is organized as follows.
In Sec.~\ref{sec:WSS} we introduce the WSS model as well as our
notation.
We review the static homogeneous Ansatz in Sec.~\ref{sec:static_homo},
and include time dependence in Sec.~\ref{sec:dynamic_homo}.
In Sec.~\ref{sec:beta_eq}, we review the relations for obtaining
charge neutrality, $\beta$-equilibrium and the corresponding
thermodynamic relations.
We then describe our fit and the hybrid equation of state in
Sec.~\ref{sec:EOS} and present the results of the neutron star
mass-radius diagrams in Sec.~\ref{sec:neutron_stars}.
We conclude the paper in Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusion} with a discussion
and outlook.


\section{Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model}\label{sec:WSS}

The holographic model we choose to employ for the description of
nuclear matter at high density is the Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model
\cite{Sakai:2004cn,Sakai:2005yt}, a top-down model of holographic QCD
based on the engineering of a couple of stacks of $N_f$
$D8/\overline{D8}$-branes on the supergravity background sourced by
$N_c$ $D4$-branes.
We will work in the configuration of antipodal branes and in the
confined geometry phase, so that the flavor branes will extend all the
way down to the tip of the cigar subspace, spanning all the
holographic direction.

In absence of a mass term for quarks (which we will neglect), the
theory after dimensional reduction to five dimensions is given by a
Dirac-Born-Infeld action supplemented by a Chern-Simons term.
Replacing the Dirac-Born-Infeld action at quadratic order in the field
strength, results in a Yang-Mills theory in curved space, with the
addition of the topological Chern-Simons term, so that the full action
within these approximations read
\beq
S=-\kappa \Tr\int\d^4x\d z\left[\frac{1}{2}h(z)\mathcal{F}_{\mu\nu}^2+k(z)\mathcal{F}_{\mu z}^2\right]+\frac{N_c}{24\pi^2}\int_{M_5}\omega_5,
\eeq
with the parameter $\kappa$ and the warp factors $k(z),h(z)$ given by
\beq
k(z)=1+z^2,\qquad
h(z)=\left(1+z^2\right)^{-\frac{1}{3}},\qquad
\kappa=\frac{\lambda N_c}{216\pi^3},
\eeq
where $\lambda$ is the 't Hooft coupling and $N_c$ is the number of
colors.
The $\U(2)$ gauge field 1-form $\calA$ is split into $\SU(2)$ and $\U(1)$
factors as
\beq
\calA = A^a \frac{\tau^a}{2} + \widehat{A}\frac{\mathbf{1}_2}{2},
\label{eq:notation}
\eeq
the field strength is given by $\calF=\d\calA+\calA\wedge\calA$,
$\tau^a$ are the standard Pauli spin matrices,
and the spacetime indices are denotes as
\beq
\alpha,\beta,\ldots = {0,M} \quad ;\quad M,N,\ldots = {i,z} \quad;\quad i,j,\ldots = {1,2,3}.
\eeq
The Chern-Simons 5-form $\omega_5$ is given by
\beq
\omega_5=\Tr\left(\mathcal{A}\wedge\mathcal{F}^2-\frac{\i}{2}\mathcal{A}^3\wedge\mathcal{F}-\frac{1}{10}\mathcal{A}^5\right),
\eeq
where the powers of forms are understood by the wedge product.
The $\U(N_f)$ gauge field describes flavor degrees of freedom: In the
present work we will assume the presence of two light flavors, thus
setting $N_f=2$ and neglecting contributions from the presence of the
strange quark, leaving their inclusion for future improvements. 
With the notation \eqref{eq:notation} we can rewrite the Chen-Simons term as
\beq
S_{\rm CS}=\frac{N_c}{24\pi^2}\int_{M_5}\Tr\left[3\widehat{A}\wedge F^2+\widehat{A}\wedge\widehat{F}^2+\d\left(\widehat{A}\wedge\left(2F\wedge A-\frac{\i}{2}A^3\right)\right)\right].
\eeq
We will assume the gauge fields $\widehat{A}_i,A_i$ to vanish at
$z=\pm \infty$, hence we drop the total derivative term. 
The top-down nature of the model enables it to only rely on two free
parameters to be fitted: the 't Hooft coupling $\lambda$ and the
Kaluza-Klein scale $M_{\rm KK}$. Note that the scale does not appear in
any of our expressions when doing calculations within the model: it is
the only mass scale of the model, and we can freely choose to work in
units of $M_{\rm KK}$, and then restore the correct power of $M_{\rm KK}$ to
obtain the results in physical units.


\section{Holographic nuclear matter: static homogeneous Ansatz}\label{sec:static_homo}

In the context of holographic QCD, baryons are described as
topological solitons of the flavor fields, and the
Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model is no exception \cite{Bolognesi:2013nja}. 
The Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto soliton can be approximated as a BPST
instanton \cite{Hata:2007mb,Hashimoto:2008zw} in the limit of large $\lambda$: its
instanton number is then identified as the baryon number, allowing for
the description of nuclei on top of single baryons.

To exactly describe infinite nuclear matter in this model is to solve
a many-soliton problem in five-dimensional curved space time: this
task is too hard to be carried out for any practical application, so
what is done in most cases is to rely on some combination of
approximations and educated guesses. A possibility is to arrange
individual solitons in a lattice \cite{Baldino:2021uie}, minimizing
the free energy density to determine the elementary cell shape and
size (hence the density): this kind of approach is generally more
reliable at low density, when the individual baryons are well
separated, and approximations made to compute the interactions between
solitons are well under control. 

At densities around nuclear saturation and above, another possible
approximation exists: since nucleons are tightly packed, we can
approximate their spatial distribution in three-dimensional space to
be homogeneous, forming a uniform distribution of continuous nuclear
matter. 
In this process every information about individual baryons is lost, in
favor of intensive quantities such as the baryonic and isospin
densities. The great simplification that this  
approach produces lies in the reduction of complicated sets of PDEs to
more manageable sets of ODEs, the only remaining variable being the
holographic coordinate $z$ (and time, whose inclusion we will discuss
in the next section).  
The homogeneous Ansatz in the static approximation is given by the
gauge field configuration 
\begin{align}
  \calA^{\rm cl}_0 = \tfrac12\wha_0 \mathds{1},\quad
  \calA^{\rm cl}_i = -\tfrac12H\tau^i,\quad
  \calA^{\rm cl}_z = 0,
  \label{eq:HomStatic}
\end{align}
with $\wha_0=\wha_0(z), H=H(z)$ being functions of only the holographic coordinate $z$.

The function $H(z)$ encodes baryonic density, as it can be thought of
as the space-averaged many-soliton distribution. It does so in a
nontrivial way if we allow it to be discontinuous: for simplicity we
will assume a discontinuity is present in the function $H(z)$ at
$z=0$, which is the coordinate at which single solitons sit to
minimize energy, however it is possible to consider configurations
with more discontinuities located at finite $z=\pm z_0$ (see
Ref.~\cite{CruzRojas:2023ugm} for the treatment in both the
Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto and the VQCD models). 
The baryon density $d$ is given as 
\begin{align}
  d&=\frac{1}{32\pi^2}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\d z\;\epsilon^{MNPQ}\Tr F_{MN}F_{PQ}\nonumber\\
  &=-\frac{3}{8\pi^2}\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}\d z\; H'H^2 \nonumber \\
  &=-\frac{1}{8\pi^2}\left[H^3\right]^{z=+\infty}_{z=0^+}-\frac{1}{8\pi^2}\left[H^3\right]_{z=-\infty}^{z=0^-}.
\end{align}
We see immediately that a continuous function $H(z)$ would not be able
to describe nuclear matter at any finite density: it has to be an odd,
discontinuous function of $z$. We choose the function $H(z)$ to be
vanishing at the UV boundary $z=\pm \infty$, so that we are left with
an IR boundary condition for $H(z)$ reading 
\beq
H(0^\pm) = \pm\left(4\pi^2 d\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}.
\eeq
From now on, we will always perform integrals over $z$ on the "positive
$z$" half of the connected branes, accounting for the symmetry of the
integrands with an overall factor of two. Note that despite the
discontinuity in $H(z)$, the field strengths $F_{MN}^a$ are still
continuous, even functions of $z$ (though in general not
differentiable at $z=0$). 

The asymptotic UV value assumed by the function $\wha_0(z)$ is mapped
into the baryonic chemical potential as per the standard holographic
dictionary: we can then impose boundary conditions  
\begin{align}
  &\wha'_0(0) = 0,\qquad& \wha_0(\infty) &= \mu,\\
  &H(0)=\left(4\pi^2 d\right)^{\frac{1}{3}},\qquad& H(\infty)&=0,
\end{align}
and numerically solve the equations of motion 
\begin{align}
  h H^3 - \frac12\p_z(k H') - \frac{N_c}{32\pi^2\kappa}H^2\hat{a}_0' &= 0,\\
  \p_z(k\hat{a}_0') + \frac{3N_c}{16\pi^2}H^2H' &= 0.
\end{align}
With the normalization chosen for the asymptotics of $\wha_0$, the
baryon number chemical potential $\mu_B$ is given by 
\beq
\mu_B = \frac{N_c}{2}\mu.
\eeq
For every value of the parameter $\mu$, the corresponding
thermodynamic equilibrium value of the density $d(\mu)$ is given by
minimizing the free energy $\Omega$, holographically dual to the
on-shell action as $\Omega = - S^{\text{on-shell}}$. The baryonic phase is
favored over the vacuum when $\Omega(d,\mu)\leq 0$, a condition that
is satisfied for $d(\mu)\geq d_0(\mu_{\rm onset})$. The value $d_0$ is the
model prediction for nuclear saturation density of symmetric matter,
and will play an important role in our choice for the fit of the free
parameters $\lambda,M_{\rm KK}$. 



\section{Isospin asymmetry: time-dependent homogeneous Ansatz}\label{sec:dynamic_homo}

The time-independent configuration introduced in the previous section
only accounts for symmetric baryonic matter. 
This can be understood by thinking about the single-baryon: a single
static soliton is a classical object, that carries no information
about the nucleon states. To have a spectrum including isospin states
we have to perform moduli space quantization \cite{Hata:2007mb}: an
arbitrary rotation in $\SU(2)$-space that corresponds to a zeromode is
introduced by performing the transformation $\tau^i\rightarrow a
\tau^i a^{-1}$. The orientation matrix $a$ is then promoted to a
time-dependent operator $a(t)$, in terms of which it is possible to
compute an effective quantum mechanical Hamiltonian that will give the
single-baryon spectrum. 
The same procedure can be applied to the homogeneous Ansatz, as
described in detail in Ref.~\cite{Bartolini:2022gdf}. In particular, the
homogeneous Ansatz is similar in its structure to the BPST instanton,
but simpler in that it lacks the position and size moduli. 
We then follow the same procedure in the treatment of rotational
moduli $a(t)\in\SU(2)$, and we define the angular velocity $\chi^i$
as: 
\beq
\chi^i \equiv -\i\Tr\left(a^{-1}\dot{a}\tau^i\right).
\eeq
The introduction of the $\SU(2)$ moduli and their time dependence turns
on new components of the gauge field, so that the new homogeneous
Ansatz for the iso-rotating configuration is given by 
\begin{align}
  \calA_0 = G a\bchi\cdot\btau a + \tfrac12\wha_0,\qquad
  \calA_i = -\tfrac12(H a \tau^i a+L\chi^i),\qquad
  \calA_z = 0,
  \label{eq:Ansatzchi}
\end{align} 
supplemented with the boundary conditions
$L(0)=G'(0)=L(+\infty)=G(+\infty)=0$.  
The classical action obtained from the time-dependent homogeneous
Ansatz is 
\begin{align}
  S_{\rm YM} = -\kappa\int\d^4x\int_0^\infty\d z\bigg[
    -&8hH^2\left(G+\frac12\right)^2\bchi\cdot\bchi
    +3hH^4\non
    &+k\left[(L')^2  - 4(G')^2 + 8(KH)^2\right]\bchi\cdot\bchi
    +3k(H')^2
    -k(\hat{a}_0')^2
    \bigg],\non
  S_{\rm CS} = -\frac{3N_c}{8\pi^2}\int\d^4x\int_0^\infty\d z&\hat{a}_0H'H^2+\frac{N_c}{4\pi^2}\int\d^4x\int_0^\infty\d z
  \left(LH'-L'GH\right)H\bchi\cdot\bchi,
\end{align}
from which the equations of motion for the fields
$H(z),\wha_0(z),L(z),G(z)$ can be derived: 
\begin{align}
  h H^3 - \frac12\p_z(k H') - \frac{N_c}{32\pi^2\kappa}H^2\hat{a}_0' &= 0,\\
  \p_z(k\hat{a}_0') + \frac{3N_c}{16\pi^2}H^2H' &= 0,\\
  \p_z(k G') - 2h H^2\left(G + \frac12\right) + \frac{N_c}{32\pi^2\kappa} H^2L' &= 0,\\
  \p_z(k L') + \frac{N_c}{8\pi^2\kappa} H\left[H G' + (1 + 2G)H'\right] &=0.
\end{align}

The field $A_0$ encodes via the holographic dictionary the information on
the isospin density $n_I$ and chemical potential $\mu_I$. This can be
understood as follows: $G(z)$ can be thought of as a holographic profile for
the angular velocity $\chi^i$, which can be traded for the
corresponding angular momentum and then canonically quantized in the
moduli space approximation. The resulting operator is identified with
both spin and isospin operators (an artifact of the spherical symmetry
of the setup). 
When we do this, the resulting quantum Hamiltonian operator is given
by  
\beq	
H= \frac{I^2}{2V\Lambda} + VU,
\eeq
with $V$ being the three-dimensional (infinite) volume, $I^2$ is the
squared isospin operator, and $\Lambda$ and $U$  given by 
\begin{align}
  \Lambda &= 2\kappa
  \int_0^{\infty}\left[2h H^2(2G+1)^2 + k((L')^2 + 4(G')^2)\right]\d z,\non
  U &= \kappa
  \int_0^{\infty}\left[3h H^4 + 3k(H')^2 + k(\wha_0')^2\right]\d z.\label{eq:LambdaU}
\end{align}
They are respectively the moment of inertia of a rigid rotor and its
internal energy density, which in our physical setup corresponds to
the energy density of symmetric nuclear matter. 

From this Hamiltonian operator, we obtain the energy per nucleon of an
isospin state $|i,i_3\rangle$, from which we can read off the
symmetry-energy parameter of infinite nuclear matter $S_N(d)$: 
\beq
\frac{E}{A} =\frac{U}{d} + S_N(d)\beta^2
+ \mathcal{O}(V^{-1}),\qquad
S_N(d) = \frac{d}{8\Lambda},
\eeq
with $\beta=(N-Z)/A$ being the isospin asymmetry parameter.

We will also need the energy density since our final aim is to obtain
an equation of state for isospin asymmetric nuclear matter in
$\beta$-equilibrium with leptons. 
From the expressions above, the energy density of isospin-asymmetric
matter is obtained from $U,\Lambda$ as 
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{E}=\frac{E}{V}=&\frac{i_3^2}{2V^2\Lambda} + U
  = \frac{1}{2\Lambda}n_I^2 + U.\label{eq:epsilonnIU}
\end{align}
The isospin chemical potential $\mu_I$ can be obtained from the
expression above by differentiating with respect to $n_I$, so that  
\beq\label{eq:muI}
\mu_I = \frac{\partial\mathcal{E} }{\partial n_I} = \frac{n_I}{\Lambda}.
\eeq
Note that we have defined $n_I$ from the isospin quantum number $i_3$,
which assume values  $\pm 1/2$ for the ground states. We choose to
identify the positive eigenvalue to correspond to the proton, and the
negative one to the neutron, following conventions from nuclear
physics. 
With this choices, if the nuclear matter is rich in neutrons (as we
expect it to be following beta equilibrium and charge neutrality), we
will have $n_I < 0$ and correspondingly also the isospin chemical
potential $\mu_I$ will be negative due to Eq.~\eqref{eq:muI}. 


\section{\texorpdfstring{$\beta$}{beta}-equilibrated matter}\label{sec:beta_eq}

The presence of the symmetry energy favors isospin-symmetric matter:
the neutron rich matter that composes the core neutron stars is the
result of the presence of negatively charged leptons that impose
electric charge neutrality to the system. The leptons with their
(anti)neutrinos, the neutrons and the protons are in equilibrium with
respect to $\beta$-decay. This condition, together with charge
neutrality, is sufficient to calculate the fractions of each particle
species at any given density. 
As discussed in Ref.~\cite{Bartolini:2022gdf} with the same normalizations
used in this work, the imposition of $\beta$-equilibrium (together
with the decoupling of the neutrinos) and electric charge neutrality
lead respectively to the conditions 
\beq
\mu_\ell &=& \mu_N - \mu_P = -\mu_I, \qquad
\ell=e,\mu, 
\label{eq:beta_equilibrium}\\
\frac{1}{2} d +n_I &=& {\textstyle\sum}_\ell n_\ell,
\label{eq:charge_neutral}
\eeq
where $\mu_X$ is the chemical potential of the particle species $X$
and we accounted for the presence of electrons ($e$) and muons ($\mu$)
in equilibrium with protons ($P$) and neutrons ($N$), while neglecting
the presence of the heavier taus ($\tau$). 

The leptonic number densities $n_\ell$ are taken as originating from the
free energy of a (massive) Fermi gas: 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Omegalepton}
\Omega_\ell = -\frac{1}{24\pi^2}\Theta\left(\mu_\ell-m_\ell\right)\left[\left(2\mu_\ell^2-5m_\ell^2\right)\mu_\ell\sqrt{\mu_\ell\ell^2-m_\ell^2}+3m_\ell^4\log\left(\frac{\sqrt{\mu_\ell^4-m_\ell^4}+\mu_\ell}{m_\ell}\right)\right],
\end{equation}
from which follows
\beq
n_\ell(\mu_\ell)=\Theta_H(\mu_\ell-m_\ell)\frac{(\mu_\ell^2-m_\ell^2)^{\frac32}}{3\pi^2}.
\label{eq:Fermi_rho}
\eeq
We will approximate the electrons to be massless, while keeping the
muons massive with $m_\mu^{\rm phys}=105.66$MeV, while the parameter
appearing in the equations is the corresponding value in units of
$M_{\rm KK}$, $m_\mu = m_\mu^{\rm phys} M_{\rm KK}^{-1}$.\footnote{Note
that by doing this we are introducing another energy scale in the
model: since the value of $m_\mu$ depends on the choice of the value
$M_{\rm KK}$, such parameter can no longer be factorized out from
the equations.}

Inserting Eq.~\eqref{eq:Fermi_rho} into the charge-neutrality
condition \eqref{eq:charge_neutral} and using the $\beta$-equilibrium
condition \eqref{eq:beta_equilibrium}, we obtain an implicit solution
for the isospin density, $n_I$, as a function of the baryon density $d$:
\begin{align}
  \frac{n_I^3}{3\pi^2\Lambda^3}
  \left[\Theta_H(-n_I)
    +(1-R^{-2}m_\mu^2)^{\frac32}\Theta_H(-R-m_\mu)
    \right] 	\mathop+n_I + \frac12 d = 0, \qquad R\equiv n_I/\Lambda.
\end{align}
From $n_I(d)$ it is then possible to compute the density of every
particle species as 
\begin{align}
  n_P(d)&=\frac{1}{2}d + n_I(d), \label{eq:populationP}\\
  n_N(d)&=\frac{1}{2}d - n_I(d),\label{eq:populationN}\\
  n_e(d)&=\frac{1}{3\pi^2}\left(\mu_I(d)^2\right)^{\frac{3}{2}},\label{eq:populatione}\\
  n_\mu(d)&=\frac{1}{3\pi^2}\left(\mu_I(d)^2-m_\mu^2\right)^{\frac{3}{2}}.\label{eq:populationmu}
\end{align}

To build an equation of state for the matter we just described, we
need now to compute the total energy density and pressure. The
building blocks are the energy densities $U$ and pressure $P_0$ of
symmetric nuclear matter, the contributions $\mathcal{E}_I$ and $P_I$
due to isospin asymmetry, and the contributions $\mathcal{E}_\ell,
P_\ell$ of leptons. 

We already know an expression for $U$ from Eq.~\eqref{eq:LambdaU}, which
we can use to compute the pressure $P_0$ using $\mu_B$ and $d$ 
\beq
P_0 = -U + \mu_B d.
\eeq
For the contributions arising from isospin asymmetry, we make use of 
the known relations \eqref{eq:muI}, \eqref{eq:epsilonnIU}:
\beq
\mathcal{E}_{I}&=& \frac{1}{2\Lambda} n_I^2,\\
P_{I}&=& -\mathcal{E}_I + \mu_I n_I = \frac{1}{2\Lambda}n_I^2 = \mathcal{E}_{I}.
\eeq
Finally, for the leptons we can use the fact that in a homogeneous
system $P=-\Omega$ holds, so that we can compute $P_\ell$ directly
from Eq.~\eqref{eq:Omegalepton}, from which the energy density follows
\begin{align}
  \mathcal{E}_e+	\mathcal{E}_\mu &= \Omega_e+\Omega_\mu +\mu_e n_e + \mu_\mu n_\mu\non
  &=  \Omega_e+\Omega_\mu -\mu_I n_P\non
  &= \Omega_e+\Omega_\mu -\frac{n_I}{\Lambda}\left( \frac{1}{2}d+n_I\right),
\end{align}
where we have made use of charge neutrality and $\beta$-equilibrium.
As a result, we can finally write the total energy density and
pressure as 
\beq
\mathcal{E}&=& U+\mathcal{E}_I+\mathcal{E}_e+\mathcal{E}_\mu,\\
P &=& P_0 + P_I-\Omega_e - \Omega_\mu,
\eeq
with every quantity involved being a function of only the baryon
density $d$. 

\section{Nuclear matter fit and hybrid equation of state}\label{sec:EOS}

% Figure environment removed
It is well known that the most common fit of the Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto
model ($M_{\rm KK}=949$MeV, $\lambda=16.6$) performs very well in the
mesonic sector, but that its quantitative reliability when employed to
compute quantities of the baryonic sector is somewhat lacking (in
particular the masses of the baryons are largely overestimated,
together with the binding energies of nuclei). 
When we move to the dense nuclear matter described by the homogeneous
Ansatz, the situation gets worse and contact with phenomenology is
lost. For example, the saturation density for $\lambda = 16.6$ is
found to be $d_0^{\lambda=16.6} = 0.00385 M_{\rm KK}^{3}$, while the
symmetry energy at saturation is of order
$S_N^{\lambda=16.6}(d_0^{\lambda=16.6})\simeq 0.1 M_{\rm KK}$: when
the value $M_{\rm KK}=949$MeV is plugged into these expressions, the
results are respectively $d_0=0.43\fm^{-3}$ and $S_N(d_0)=97$MeV.  
If we ignore these issues and try to build the core of neutron stars
with this fit, we unsurprisingly find that they never reach
$1.5$M$_{\odot}$, and their radius can at most be slightly larger than
$7$km.  
Realistic values for the highest mass for a stable star and for the
average radii have been obtained with a fully holographic equation of
state (though with the phenomenological input of the surface tension
of the domain wall between nuclear matter and vacuum) from the
Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model in Ref.~\cite{Kovensky:2021kzl}: to obtain a
realistic-looking neutron star while keeping $M_{\rm KK}=949$MeV, it
is necessary to decrease $\lambda$ to around the value $\lambda=10$, with
the results being highly sensitive to changes around this
value. Realistic masses and radii for neutron stars as functions of the model
parameters $\lambda,M_{KK}$ within this setup have been further explored
in Ref.~\cite{Kovensky:2021wzu}. However, even producing stars with adequate radii
and masses, nuclear matter inside the stars of Ref.~\cite{Kovensky:2021kzl} 
fails to be as rich in neutrons as we expect in neutron stars:
this is due to the
extremely high value of the symmetry energy, which pushes matter
towards isospin symmetric configurations, and remains true even if we adopt
the lower values of symmetry energies found in Ref.~\cite{Bartolini:2022gdf}, as
long as we adopt fits defined in the ``QCD window'' introduced in Ref.~\cite{Kovensky:2021wzu}.
Our aim is to describe realistic neutron star cores and connect the
equation of state from holography with a phenomenologically accurate
equation of state at lower energy densities: within this approach, it
makes little sense to employ a fit that overestimates physical
quantities that are crucial in the formation of the structure of
neutron stars by a factor of roughly three. Moreover, the fit is done
on single-particle properties, but information on individual particles
is lost when employing the homogeneous Ansatz, which does not connect
smoothly to the finite particle number setup. 
% Figure environment removed

We hence propose another choice of fit for the free parameters of the
Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model, expected to give precise results when
applied to highly dense matter, especially in the context of the
homogeneous Ansatz. The first quantity we fit is the nuclear
saturation density for symmetric matter: phenomenologically this value
lies at about $0.15$fm$^{-3}$. The value of the model-derived
saturation density in units of $M_{\rm KK}$ does not depend on $M_{\rm KK}$
itself, so we only need to compute the value $d_0(\lambda)$ for
a wide range of values of $\lambda$, then impose the condition 
\beq
d_0(\lambda) M_{\rm KK}^{3} = 0.15\text{fm}^{-3} .
\eeq 
This defines the function $M_{\rm KK}(\lambda)$ we plot in figure
\ref{fig:MkkLambda}. The second choice we employ to eliminate any
further freedom is to have a realistic symmetry energy at saturation
density. The phenomenologically accepted values range between
$30.6$MeV and $32.8$MeV: we fit the model to both values, so to
produce an "error bar" for our predictions. 
As a result, the two fits for which we will present results correspond
to 
\beq\label{eq:fitHlambda}	
\lambda &=& 75.5\phantom{7}\qquad,\qquad M_{\rm KK} = 343.85\MeV\quad \Rightarrow \quad S_N(d_0) = 30.6 \MeV,\\
\label{eq:fitLlambda}
\lambda &=& 65.57\qquad,\qquad M_{\rm KK} = 365.07\MeV\quad \Rightarrow \quad S_N(d_0) = 32.8 \MeV.
\eeq
Using these fits we build the equation of state for holographic
matter, which we assume to be the appropriate description at densities
above saturation: to describe lower-density regions of the neutron
star, namely the crust, we would need a more refined construction,
possibly deviating from the homogeneous approximation, for example
nuclear pasta phases. A similar construction was performed in
Ref.~\cite{Kovensky:2021kzl}, where a crust was built from the mixed phase
of lumps of nuclear matter in $\beta$-equilibrium, immersed in a gas
of leptons, with the surface tension of the domain wall, separating the
phases, as the parameter to regulate the onset of the transition from
homogeneous matter to the mixed phase. 
Here we follow another possible approach, that of a ``hybrid'' equation
of state: within this framework, we forego the attempt of building the
full equation of state from a single model, and instead patch together
equations of state coming from different models, each derived within
the domain of applicability of the models themselves.  
In particular, equations of state for low-density nuclear matter are
already developed with a higher precision than the one we can hope to
achieve within the holographic model: we then choose to employ the
SLy4 equation of state \cite{Douchin:2001sv,Haensel:1993zw} and then
at larger densities switch to the holographic equation of state
described in the previous section keeping the baryon density
continuous. 

By doing this, we obtain the equations of state shown in figure
\ref{fig:EOS}, where they are compared with currently established
bounds, with the full SLy4 and with the "core-only" holographic
equations of state that we would have if we were not to perform the
patching.

From the equation of state, we can numerically compute the speed of
sound: the resulting plot is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:Speed}, and it
shows the presence of a discontinuity at the density corresponding to
the junction between the two equations of state from different
models. The holographic equation of state is highly stiff as it rapidly
crosses the conformal value of $c_s^2=1/3$: this is a feature it
shares with many equations of state derived from holography, but even
for this category it achieves very high sound speeds, with the
highest speed present in stable neutron stars ranging in the interval
$c_s^2\in\left(0.652,0.660\right)$, depending on the choice of fit (the
two star markers in Fig.~\ref{fig:Speed} pinpoint these
values). Note also that the stability of the stars is what limits the
speed of sound to these values: the equation of  state extrapolated to
higher densities produces higher velocities, peaking slightly below
$0.8$ before decreasing again. 

% Figure environment removed
We can also test our choices of fit against the particle populations:
using Eqs.~\eqref{eq:populationP} to \eqref{eq:populationmu} we
can compute the number densities of each species of particles, and
compare them with those of the SLy4 equation of state at the junction
point. 
The results are presented in the two panels of Fig.~\ref{fig:Fracs}:
we can see from the right panel that the disagreement is, in the worst
case scenario, less then about $10\%$, and the small error bar
generated for our fit allows for the particle fractions to be
continuous. If we wanted to select a single fit for the model within
the window provided, we could possibly take this as a third condition
and try to find one that gives the best continuity for the particle
fractions: we do not push the analysis that far, but it is already
possible to argue from the figure, that such a fit would be
closer to that of Eq.~\eqref{eq:fitHlambda} corresponding to
$S_N(d_0)=30.6$MeV. 


\section{Neutron stars}\label{sec:neutron_stars}

We finally want to derive properties of neutron stars built with the
equation of state we just constructed: to do so, we solve numerically
the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov (TOV) equations for a range of central
pressures ($P_0$). Each solution will provide a neutron star with
central density $P_0$, radius $R(P_0)$, mass $M(P_0)$ and tidal
deformability $\Lambda(P_0)$. 
The TOV equations are given by 
\begin{align}\label{eq:TOV1}
  \frac{dP}{dr}&= -G(\calE+ P)\frac{m+4\pi r^3 P}{r(r-2Gm)},\\
  \frac{dm}{dr}&= 4\pi r^2 \calE,\label{eq:TOV2}
\end{align}
and describe static neutron stars, hence we are neglecting the effects
of rotation in this analysis. 
% Figure environment removed
From the solution of \eqref{eq:TOV1}, \eqref{eq:TOV2} we produce
relations between mass and radius, and mass and tidal deformability. 
In particular the mass-radius curve represents the best test currently
available for neutron stars models: our results for this relation are
provided in Fig.~\ref{fig:MR}, where we plot in orange the stars
arising from the holographic "core-only" equation of state, in purple
the ones generated by the SLy4 equation of state, and finally in black
the ones from the hybrid equations of state. 
Remarkably, the hybrid SLy4-WSS equation of state fitted to saturation
density and symmetry energy results in neutron stars satisfying every
constraint in the mass-radius curve, and achieve rather high maximum
masses for stable stars, compatible with the highest mass measured to
date, i.e.~$2.35\pm0.17M_{\odot}$ of PSR J0952-0607\footnote{Though
this constraint does not necessarily need to be satisfied by static objects since
PSR J0952-0607 is a pulsar with $1.41$ms rotation period.}. 

% Figure environment removed
In Fig.~\ref{fig:Tidal} we plot the tidal deformability against the
mass of the star: the tidal deformability $\Lambda_{1.4}$ for a neutron star
of mass $1.4M_{\odot}$ ends up being quite high compared to the
available bounds. In particular, the curve corresponding to the fit
from Eq.~\eqref{eq:fitLlambda} ends up passing slightly above the upper
bound from one of the references adopted, another hint that possibly
the favored fit is one closer to Eq.~\eqref{eq:fitHlambda}.


\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we have computed neutron star mass-radius curves for
stable static stars in the Witten-Sakai-Sugimoto model.
Due to the approximation of using the homogeneous Ansatz, we
acknowledge that the results are not expected to be trustable at very
low densities below saturation density.
We have thus constructed a hybrid equation of state by patching the
SLy4 EOS together with that of the holographic WSS model, taking into
account the symmetry energy, charge neutrality and
$\beta$-equilibrium.
The calibration of the model in this paper, has been chosen by fixing
the saturation density to the physical one; this fixed the mass scale
$M_{\rm KK}$ of the model and furthermore fixed the symmetry energy
to the phenomenologically accepted value at saturation density, by
adjusting the 't Hooft coupling.
We have calculated everything for two fits, corresponding to the upper
(solid lines) and lower (dashed lines) value of the error bar on the
symmetry energy.
The results we find are unexpectedly good for a top-down holographic
QCD model.
In particular, we find a large maximal mass between $2.26M_\odot$ and
$2.35M_{\odot}$, which is hard to achieve for many nuclear physics and
phenomenologically driven models.
In addition, we pass the current mass-radius constraints as well as
the constraints on the tidal deformability (the latter only for one of
the fits).

The are many small improvements that could be made, in order to
further refine the results and hence to achieve precision neutron star
phenomenology from a top-down holographic QCD (WSS) based model.
In particular, we have not included the strange quark (s) in the
model, but since we also have not included quark masses, those should
be incorporated too, in order to achieve a physical model.
Furthermore, we have considered the hybrid model of patching together
the SLy4 with our holographic WSS results, but the low-density
equation of state could in principle be derived from the WSS model by
taking into account pasta phases, which in turn would require many
more computations such as wall tensions etc.
Another refinement of the model would be to take into account
higher-order corrections due to the isospin asymmetry, which would
correspond to $(\bchi\cdot\bchi)^2$ terms.
In principle, the WSS model itself also predicts more accurate
higher-order corrections, one example is to consider the full
Dirac-Born-Infeld action instead of the leading Yang-Mills term and
there are also corrections in $1/N_c$ and $1/\lambda$, although
computing those may be unpractical.
We will leave such refinements of the model for future work.
