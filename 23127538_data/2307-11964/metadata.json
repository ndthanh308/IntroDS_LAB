  "abstract": "In contrast to the general thought that the collisions are intrinsically dephasing in nature and detrimental to quantum entanglement at room or higher temperatures, here, we show that in the conventional ladder-type three-level electromagnetically induced transparency (EIT) configuration, when the probe field intensity is not very weak as compared to the pump field, the entanglement between the bright pump and probe fields can be remarkably enhanced with the increase of the collisional decay rates in a moderate range in an inhomogeneously-broadened atomic system. The strengthened entanglement results from the enhancement of constructive interference and suppression of destructive interference between one-photon and multi-photon transition pathways. Our results clearly indicate that the collisions offer a promising alternative to enhance entanglement at room or higher temperatures despite of the dephasing nature, which provides great convenience for experimental implementation, and opens new prospects and applications in realistic quantum computation and quantum information processing.",
