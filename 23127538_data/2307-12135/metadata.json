  "abstract": "Multi-distribution learning is a natural generalization of PAC learning to settings with multiple data distributions. There remains a significant gap between the known upper and lower bounds for PAC-learnable classes. In particular, though we understand the sample complexity of learning a VC dimension d class on $k$ distributions to be $O(ε^{-2} \\ln(k)(d + k) + \\min\\{ε^{-1} dk, ε^{-4} \\ln(k) d\\})$, the best lower bound is $Ω(ε^{-2}(d + k \\ln(k)))$. We discuss recent progress on this problem and some hurdles that are fundamental to the use of game dynamics in statistical learning.",
