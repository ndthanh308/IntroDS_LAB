  "abstract": "We predict that ferromagnetic resonance in insulating magnetic film with inplane magnetization radiates electric fields polarized along the magnetization with opposite amplitudes at two sides of the magnetic insulator, which can be modulated strongly by adjacent superconductors. With a single superconductor adjacent to the magnetic insulator this radiated electric field is totally reflected with a $π$-phase shift, which thereby vanishes at the superconductor side and causes no influence on the ferromagnetic resonance. When the magnetic insulator is sandwiched by two superconductors, this reflection becomes back and forth, so the electric field exists at both superconductors that drives the Meissner supercurrent, which in turn shifts efficiently the ferromagnetic resonance. We predict an ultrastrong coupling between magnons in the yttrium iron garnet and Cooper pairs in NbN with the frequency shift achieving tens of percent of the bare ferromagnetic resonance.",
