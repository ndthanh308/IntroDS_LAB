  "abstract": "In this paper, we incorporate the effect of nonlinear damping with the concept of locally resonant metamaterials to enable vibration attenuation beyond the conventional bandgap range. The proposed design combines a linear host cantilever beam and periodically distributed inertia amplifiers as nonlinear local resonators. The geometric nonlinearity induced by the inertia amplifiers causes an amplitude-dependent nonlinear damping effect. Through the implementation of both modal superposition and numerical harmonic methods the finite nonlinear metamaterial is accurately modelled. The resulting nonlinear frequency response reveals the bandgap is both amplitude-dependent and broadened. Furthermore, the modal frequencies are also attenuated due to the nonlinear damping effect. The theoretical results are validated experimentally. By embedding the nonlinear damping effect into locally resonant metamaterials, wideband attenuation of the proposed metamaterial is achieved, which opens new possibilities for versatile metamaterials beyond the limit of their linear counterparts.",
