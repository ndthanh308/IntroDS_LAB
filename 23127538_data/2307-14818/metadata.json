  "abstract": "Paraphrasing is the task of expressing an essential idea or meaning in different words. But how different should the words be in order to be considered an acceptable paraphrase? And can we exclusively use automated metrics to evaluate the quality of a paraphrase? We attempt to answer these questions by conducting experiments on a German data set and performing automatic and expert linguistic evaluation.",
