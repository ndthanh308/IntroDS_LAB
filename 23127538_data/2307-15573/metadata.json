  "abstract": "Let $k \\geq 1$. A graph $G$ is $\\mathbf{W_k}$ if for any $k$ pairwise disjoint independent vertex subsets $A_1, \\dots, A_k$ in $G$, there exist $k$ pairwise disjoint maximum independent sets $S_1, \\dots, S_k$ in $G$ such that $A_i \\subseteq S_i$ for $i \\in [k]$. Recognizing $\\mathbf{W_1}$ graphs is co-NP-hard, as shown by Chvátal and Slater (1993) and, independently, by Sankaranarayana and Stewart (1992). Extending this result and answering a recent question of Levit and Tankus, we show that recognizing $\\mathbf{W_k}$ graphs is co-NP-hard for $k \\geq 2$. On the positive side, we show that recognizing $\\mathbf{W_k}$ graphs is, for each $k\\geq 2$, FPT parameterized by clique-width and by tree-width. Finally, we construct graphs $G$ that are not $\\mathbf{W_2}$ such that, for every vertex $v$ in $G$ and every maximal independent set $S$ in $G - N[v]$, the largest independent set in $N(v) \\setminus S$ consists of a single vertex, thereby refuting a conjecture of Levit and Tankus.",
