reducing the problem of whether an infinite state system, or a finite but too large one, satisfies
a temporal logic property to model checking that property on a finite state abstract version.
The most common way of defining such abstractions is by defining a quotient of the original
system’s set of states, together with abstract versions of the transitions and the predicates.
Many methods differ in their details but agree on their general use of a quotient map. There
is always a minimal system (Kripke structure) making this quotient map a simulation.},

In this paper we define an operational semantics of a basic class of P systems, and give two implementations of the operational semantics using rewriting logic. We present some results regarding these implementations, including two operational correspondence results, and discuss why these implementations are relevant in order to take advantage of good features of both structural operational semantics and rewriting logic.},
