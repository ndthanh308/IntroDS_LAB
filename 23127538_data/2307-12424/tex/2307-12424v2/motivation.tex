\section{Natural experiment: introduction of timers}
\label{sec:natural_exp}


% We examined the mean rating of users over a period of 16 months (between January 2020 and May 2022).
% Figure~\ref{fig:split_corr} shows the correlation between the mean user rating in two consecutive months along with confidence intervals here, via bootstrapping, and users with ratings less than the $20^{th}$ percentile of ratings ($7$ ratings) are excluded.
% The correlation decreases the most in January 2021, which is when the interface was changed.






% 1. Users heterogeneous
% 2. A function of user more than songs
% 3. User interface tunes both of these things.

% The reduction indicates that the mean rating per user was influenced by the interface modification, and as a result, it motivated the experiment detailed below.




%Our work focuses on whether we can improve the platform interface design in such a way that it incentivizes users to give real trinary ratings to songs that are aligned with their individual tastes, thus limiting the super-like and pickiness phenomena among users which resulting in quality data.





%TODO: add limitation of the natural experiment
%TODO: Limitations about platform/what is missing from before/after
%Limitation: low traffic in months adjacents to the modifications
% overlap users number was low
%overall users number low
% can't analyze personalied since algorithms changed

%TODO: what will be learned from an actual experiment
