\subsection{Epistemic Planning Domains}\label{sec:domains}
    We overview the planning domains used for the evaluation.
    
    
%\begin{compactitem}
    %\item 
    \mypar{Assemble Line (AL):} there are two agents, each responsible for processing a different part of a product. Each agent can fail in processing its part and can inform the other agent of the status of her task. The agents can decide to \emph{assemble} the product or to \emph{restart} the process, depending on their knowledge about the product status. This domain is parametrized on the maximum \emph{modal depth} $d$ of formulae that appear in the action descriptions. The goal in this domain is fixed, \ie the agents must assemble the product. The aim of this domain is to analyze the impact of the modal depth both in terms of grounding and solving performances.
    
    %\item
    \mypar{Coin in the Box (CB):} this is a generalization of the domain presented in Example 1. %\ref{ex:k_model}
    Three agents are in a room where a closed box contains a coin. None of them knows whether the coin lies heads or tails up. To look at the coin, the agents need to first open the box. Agents can be attentive or distracted: only attentive agents are able to see what actions are executed. Moreover, agents can \emph{signal} others to make them attentive and can also distract them. The goal is for one or more agents to learn the coin position.
    
    %\item 
    \mypar{Collaboration and Communication (CC):} $n {\geq} 2$ agents move along a corridor with $k {\geq} 2$ rooms in which $m {\geq} 1$ boxes are located. Whenever an agent enters a room, it can determine whether a box is there. Agents can then communicate information about the position of the boxes to each other. The goal is to have some agent learn the position of one or more boxes and to know what other agents have learnt.
    
    %\item 
    \mypar{Grapevine (Gr):} $n {\geq} 2$ agents can move along a corridor with $2$ rooms and share their own ``secret'' to agents in the same room. The goal requires agents to know the secret of one or more agents and to hide their secret to others.
    
    %\item 
    \mypar{Selective Communication (SC):} $n {\geq} 2$ agents can move along a corridor with $k {\geq} 2$ rooms. The agents might share some information, represented by an atom $q$. In each room, only a certain subset of agents is able to listen to what others share. The goal requires for some specific subset of agents to know the information and to hide it to others.
