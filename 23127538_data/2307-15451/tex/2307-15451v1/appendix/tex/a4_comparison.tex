\section{Graphical Comparison}
    We briefly report a concrete example on the succinctness of the possibility-based representation, compared to the Kripke-based one (Figures \ref{fig:delphic} and \ref{fig:kripke}). The figures were generated by our tool. As you can see, even for small plans of length 5, the \textsc{delphic} semantics provide a much more succinct representation. Specifically, in Figure \ref{fig:delphic} we obtain a total of 15 possibilities, while in Figure \ref{fig:kripke} we obtain 126 possible worlds. This clearly confirms the benefits of the \textsc{delphic} semantics.
