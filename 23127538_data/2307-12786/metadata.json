  "abstract": "In fluid mechanics, dimensionless numbers like the Reynolds number help classify flows. We argue that such a classification is also relevant for crowd flows by putting forward the dimensionless Intrusion and Avoidance numbers.Using an extensive dataset, we show that these delineate regimes that are characterized by distinct structural signatures, best probed in terms of distances at low Avoidance number and times-to-collision at low Intrusion number.These findings prompt a perturbative expansion of the agent-based dynamics; the generic models thus obtained perform well in (and only in) the regime in which they were derived.",
