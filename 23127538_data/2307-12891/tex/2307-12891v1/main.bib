abstract = {We present a modified commercial L-4C geophone with interferometric readout that demonstrates a resolution 60 times lower than the included coil-magnet readout at low frequencies. The intended application for the modified sensor is in vibration isolation platforms that require improved performance at frequencies lower than 1 Hz. To illustrate it’s application a controls- and noise-model of an Advanced LIGO ‘HAM-ISI’ vibration isolation system was developed, and shows that our sensor can reduce the residual motion of the platforms by a factor of 70 at 0.1 Hz.}

  abstract      = {We report the observation of a gravitational-wave signal produced by the coalescence of two stellar-mass black holes. The signal, GW151226, was observed by the twin detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) on December 26, 2015 at 03:38:53 UTC. The signal was initially identified within 70 s by an online matched-filter search targeting binary coalescences. Subsequent off-line analyses recovered GW151226 with a network signal-to-noise ratio of 13 and a significance greater than 5 $\sigma$. The signal persisted in the LIGO frequency band for approximately 1 s, increasing in frequency and amplitude over about 55 cycles from 35 to 450 Hz, and reached a peak gravitational strain of $3.4_{-0.9}^{+0.7} \times 10^{-22}$. The inferred source-frame initial black hole masses are $14.2_{-3.7}^{+8.3} M_{\odot}$ and $7.5_{-2.3}^{+2.3} M_{\odot}$ and the final black hole mass is $20.8_{-1.7}^{+6.1} M_{\odot}$. We find that at least one of the component black holes has spin greater than 0.2. This source is located at a luminosity distance of $440_{-190}^{+180}$ Mpc corresponding to a redshift $0.09_{-0.04}^{+0.03}$. All uncertainties define a 90 % credible interval. This second gravitational-wave observation provides improved constraints on stellar populations and on deviations from general relativity.},

  abstract      = {On August 14, 2017 at 10:30:43 UTC, the Advanced Virgo detector and the two Advanced LIGO detectors coherently observed a transient gravitational-wave signal produced by the coalescence of two stellar mass black holes, with a false-alarm-rate of $\lesssim$ 1 in 27000 years. The signal was observed with a three-detector network matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of 18. The inferred masses of the initial black holes are $30.5_{-3.0}^{+5.7}$ Msun and $25.3_{-4.2}^{+2.8}$ Msun (at the 90% credible level). The luminosity distance of the source is $540_{-210}^{+130}~\mathrm{Mpc}$, corresponding to a redshift of $z=0.11_{-0.04}^{+0.03}$. A network of three detectors improves the sky localization of the source, reducing the area of the 90% credible region from 1160 deg$^2$ using only the two LIGO detectors to 60 deg$^2$ using all three detectors. For the first time, we can test the nature of gravitational wave polarizations from the antenna response of the LIGO-Virgo network, thus enabling a new class of phenomenological tests of gravity.},

  abstract      = {On August 17, 2017 at 12:41:04 UTC the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo gravitational-wave detectors made their first observation of a binary neutron star inspiral. The signal, GW170817, was detected with a combined signal-to-noise ratio of 32.4 and a false-alarm-rate estimate of less than one per $8.0\times10^4$ years. We infer the component masses of the binary to be between 0.86 and 2.26 $M_\odot$, in agreement with masses of known neutron stars. Restricting the component spins to the range inferred in binary neutron stars, we find the component masses to be in the range 1.17 to 1.60 $M_\odot$, with the total mass of the system $2.74^{+0.04}_{-0.01}\,M_\odot$. The source was localized within a sky region of 28 deg$^2$ (90% probability) and had a luminosity distance of $40^{+8}_{-14}$ Mpc, the closest and most precisely localized gravitational-wave signal yet. The association with the gamma-ray burst GRB 170817A, detected by Fermi-GBM 1.7 s after the coalescence, corroborates the hypothesis of a neutron star merger and provides the first direct evidence of a link between these mergers and short gamma-ray bursts. Subsequent identification of transient counterparts across the electromagnetic spectrum in the same location further supports the interpretation of this event as a neutron star merger. This unprecedented joint gravitational and electromagnetic observation provides insight into astrophysics, dense matter, gravitation and cosmology.},

  abstract = {This paper presents the results of the past seven years of experimental investigation and testing done on the two-stage twelve-axis vibration isolation platform for Advanced LIGO gravity waves observatories. This five-ton two-and-half-meter wide system supports more than a 1000kg of very sensitive equipment. It provides positioning capability and seismic isolation in all directions of translation and rotation. To meet the very stringent requirements of Advanced LIGO, the system must provide more than three orders of magnitude of isolation over a very large bandwidth. It must bring the motion below 10−11 m/Hz at 1Hz and 10−12 m/Hz at 10Hz. A prototype of this system has been built in 2006. It has been extensively tested and analyzed during the following two years. This paper shows how the experimental results obtained with the prototype were used to engineer the final design. It highlights how the engineering solutions implemented not only improved the isolation performance but also greatly simplified the assembly, testing, and commissioning process. During the past two years, five units have been constructed, tested, installed and commissioned at each of the two LIGO observatories. Five other units are being built for an upcoming third observatory. The test results presented show that the system meets the motion requirements, and reach the sensor noise in the control bandwidth.},

This paper presents the final design of the vibration isolation and positioning platform used in Advanced LIGO to support the interferometer's core optics. This five-ton two-and-half-m wide system operating in ultra-high vacuum. It features two stages of isolation mounted in series. The stages are imbricated to reduce the overall height. Each stage provides isolation in all directions of translation and rotation. The system is instrumented with a unique combination of low noise relative and inertial sensors. The active control provides isolation from 0.1Hz to 30Hz. It brings the platform motion down to 10−11 m/Hz at 1Hz. Active and passive isolation combine to bring the platform motion below 10−12 m/Hz at 10Hz. The passive isolation lowers the motion below 10−13 m/Hz at 100Hz. The paper describes how the platform has been engineered not only to meet the isolation requirements, but also to permit the construction, testing, and commissioning process of the fifteen units needed for Advanced LIGO observatories.},

  abstract      = {We present the conceptual design and noise analysis of a novel inertial-         isolation scheme based on six degree-of-freedom (6D)         interferometric sensing of a single reference mass. It is         capable of reducing inertial motion by more than two orders of         magnitude at 100 mHz compared with what is achievable with         state-of-the-art seismometers. This will enable substantial         improvements in the low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational-         wave detectors. The scheme is inherently two-stage, the         reference mass is softly suspended within the platform to be         isolated, which is itself suspended from the ground. The         platform is held constant relative to the reference mass and         this closed-loop control effectively transfers the low         acceleration-noise of the reference mass to the platform. The         loop gain also reduces non-linear couplings and dynamic range         requirements in the soft-suspension mechanics and the         interferometric sensing.},

  abstract  = {The detection of gravitational waves remains one of the most challenging prospects faced by experimental physicists. One of the most significant limits to the sensitivity of current, and future, long-baseline interferometric gravitational wave detectors is thermal displacement noise of the test masses and their suspensions. Suspension thermal noise will be an important noise source at operating frequencies between approximately 10 and 30 Hz, and it results from a combination of thermoelastic damping, surface loss and bulk loss associated with the suspension fibres, and weld loss from their attachment. Its effects can be reduced by minimizing thermoelastic loss and optimizing pendulum dilution factor via the appropriate choice of geometry of the suspension fibre and attachment geometry. This paper will discuss the design and fabrication of a prototype of the fused silica suspension stage for use in the advanced LIGO (aLIGO) detector network, analysing in detail the design of the fused silica attachment pieces (ears), together with the suspension assembly techniques. We also present a full thermal noise analysis of the prototype suspension, taking into account for the first time the precise shape of the actual fibres used, and weld loss. We shall demonstrate the suitability of this suspension for installation into aLIGO.},

The drag-free control system is one of the key technology elements that shall be verified. Its design is strongly connected to the overall system and experimental design, in particular, via the following issues: the differential test mass motion and thus the science measurements depend on the control system; design constraints, such as negative stiffness of test masses and electrostatic actuation cross-talk, have an impact on science and control system performance; derived requirements for control system components, in particular, the micro-propulsion system, must be within reasonable and feasible limits. In this paper, the control design approach is outlined and the system-related issues are addressed.},

This consists of 55 binary black hole mergers and the 2 binary neutron star mergers, GW170817 and GW190425. We find no additional significant binary neutron star or neutron star–black hole merger events. The most confident new detection is the binary black hole merger GW190925_232845, which was observed by the LIGO–Hanford and Virgo observatories with its primary and secondary component masses are and , respectively. We estimate the parameters of all binary black hole events using an up-to-date waveform model that includes both subdominant harmonics and precession effects. To enable deep follow up as our understanding of the underlying populations evolves, we make available our comprehensive catalog of events, including the subthreshold population of candidates, and the posterior samples of our source parameter estimates.},

  abstract      = {Gravitational waves from binary black hole and neutron star mergers are being regularly detected. As of 2021, ninety confident gravitational wave detections have been made by the LIGO and Virgo detectors. Work is ongoing to further increase the sensitivity of the detectors for the fourth observing run, including installing some of the A+ upgrades designed to lower the fundamental noise that limits the sensitivity to gravitational waves. In this review, we will overview how the LIGO detectors work, including their optical configuration and lock acquisition procedure, discuss the detectors' fundamental and technical noise limits and compare to the current measured sensitivity, and review the A+ upgrades currently being installed in the detectors.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a high-resolution Horizontal Interferometric Inertial Sensor (HINS) is developed for active seismic isolation of gravitational wave detection instrument. Its resonance frequency can be tuned down to as low as 0.08 Hz thanks to the use of a Lehman pendulum and the inverted pendulum like mechanisms. Combined with a novel homodyne quadrature interferometer, a high resolution of 2 × 10−13 m∕Hz (or 7.9 × 10−12 (m/s2)∕Hz) at 1 Hz can be obtained. A dynamic analysis is performed to investigate the response of the HINS to different types of excitations. A noise budgeting of the HINS is also conducted, which indicates that the resolution of HINS is limited by the thermomechancial noise from 0.01 to 1 Hz and by the thermal electrical noise of the photodetectors above 1 Hz.},

  abstract      = {LISA Pathfinder is the technological demonstrator space mission for the         future gravitational waves observatory in space eLISA, with the         aim of measure the differential acceleration between free-         falling test masses orbiting in the same apparatus at a level of         30 fm/s-2Hz-1/2 at 1 mHz. Because the satellite can't follow the         two masses at the same time, the second mass must be forced to         follow either the other one or the spacecraft. The actuation         force applied to compensate this effect introduces a dominant         source of force noise in the mission noise budget at frequency         near and below the mHz. The free-fall mode actuation control         scheme has been designed to suppress this noise source and avoid         actuation instabilities: actuation is limited to brief periodic         impulses, with test masses in free fall in between two kicks.         This actuation-free motion is then analyzed for the remaining         sources of acceleration ultra noise. A free-fall mode parallel         testing has been successfully implemented on torsion pendulum         facility at the University of Trento and the results of the         measurement campaign are ready to be shown and discussed. The         implementation of the data analysis algorithms to estimate the         spectrum of the acceleration of the controlled test mass, and         the estimation of system parameters such as the force gradients,         stiffness terms, are also part of this work. The free-fall mode         has been tested at the level of 2 fNm/Hz-1/2, at the frequencies         of 1 mHz, corresponding to an acceleration of about 100 fm /s-2         Hz-1/2. The ground tests have nevertheless allowed to develop         and test quantitatively this innovative method of noise         reduction due to actuation noise, contributing to its         development for the LISA Pathfinder mission.},

  abstract  = {Modern gravitational-wave observatories require robust low-frequency active seismic isolation in order to keep the interferometer at its ideal operating conditions. Seismometers are used to measure both the motion of the ground and isolated platform. These devices are susceptible to contamination from ground tilt at frequencies below 0.1 Hz, particularly arising from wind-pressure acting on building walls. Consequently, during LIGO’s first observing run both observatories suffered significant downtime when wind-speeds were above 7 m s−1. We describe the use of ground rotation sensors at the LIGO Hanford Observatory to correct nearby ground seismometers to produce tilt-free ground translation signals. The use of these signals for sensor correction control improved low-frequency seismic isolation and allowed the observatory to operate under wind speeds as high as 15–20 m s−1.},
