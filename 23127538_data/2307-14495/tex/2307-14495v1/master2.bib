ABSTRACT = {An enhanced long-range navigation (eLoran) system was selected as the backup of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), and experts and scholars are committed to improving the accuracy of the eLoran system such that its accuracy is close to the GNSS system. A differential method called eLoran differential timing technology is applied to the eLoran system, which has been used in maritime applications of eLoran. In this study, an application of eLoran differential timing technology in a terrestrial medium is carried out. Based on the eLoran timing service error, the correlation of the timing service error is analyzed in theory quantitatively to obtain the range of the difference station in the ground. The results show that to satisfy the timing accuracy of 100 ns, the action range of eLoran difference station on the land needs to be less than 55 km. Therefore, the eLoran differential method is proposed, and in the difference station, the theoretical calculation is combined with the measurement of the signal delay to obtain the difference information, which is sent to the users to adjust the prediction delay and improve the eLoran timing precision. The experiment was carried out in the Guan Zhong Plain, and the timing error of the user decreased from 394.7287 ns (pre-difference) to 19.5890 ns (post-difference). The proposed method is found to effectively enhance the timing precision of the eLoran system within the scope of action.},

ABSTRACT = {Currently, narrowband Power line communication (PLC) is considered an attractive communication system in smart grid environments for applications such as advanced metering infrastructure (AMI). In this paper, we will present a comprehensive comparison and analysis in time and frequency domain of noise measured in China and Italy. In addition, impulsive noise in these two countries are mainly analyzed and modeled using two probability based models, Middleton Class A (MCA) model and    α    stable distribution model. The results prove that noise measured in China is rich in impulsive noise, and can be modeled well by    α    stable distribution model, while noise measured in Italy has less impulsive noise, and can be better modeled by the MCA model.},

  abstract = {The paper presents an algorithm for- and shows the implementation of a method to perform parametric variation studies using electromagnetic transients programs applied to an offshore wind farm. Those kind of studies are used to investigate the sensitivity of a given phenomena to variation of parameters in an electric system. The proposed method allows varying any parameter of a circuit, including the simulation settings and exploits the specific structure of the ATP-EMTP software. In the implementation of the method, Matlab software is used to control the execution of the ATP solver. Two examples are shown, for both time domain and frequency domain studies, where the sensitivity of maximum overvoltages at transformer terminals and the admittance resonances in a radial of an offshore wind farm to a change of the collection grid cable parameters is investigated.}

abstract={This paper presents experimental research on the noise characteristics performed on 10-kV overhead power lines. The frequency range of interest is from 40 kHz to 2 MHz. The results show that: 1) The noise level of the 10-kV power networks depends on the power network structure, configuration, and loads. It is often higher than that of the low-voltage power networks. The noise power spectrum density usually follows the exponential distribution. However, if the power lines cross with the lines of higher voltage class power networks, the distribution is impacted by the noise from the higher voltage power network. 2) In the 10-kV power line, the noise at the power-supply side (head side) is a little higher than that at the receiving end (tail side) whereas the noise distributes uniformly. The system impedance at the busbar absorbs some noise power. 3) The noise level of phase-to-phase coupling is usually lower than or at least not greater than those of the related two single-phase-to-ground coupling, respectively},
