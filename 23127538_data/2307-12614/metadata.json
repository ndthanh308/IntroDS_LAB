  "abstract": "We are investigating the localization of matter that interacts nonminimally with gravity within thick braneworld models generated by a scalar bulk. Our review focuses on two models of scalar thick branes. The natural mechanism is used to analyze the localization of the fields. Without losing the point of field localization, we examine matter field localizations by considering the asymptotic behavior of the warp function on z towards infinity. Both massless and massive modes of the nonminimally coupled scalar field are localized on the brane in both models. When the coupling is minimal, the scalar field is localized for the massless mode. A nonminimally coupled vector field behaves similarly to the nonminimally coupled scalar field, the massless and massive modes in both models are localized. For a nonminimally coupled spinor field, in model 1, we observe localization of the spinor for massive mode, while in model 2, only the massless spinor field is localized.",
