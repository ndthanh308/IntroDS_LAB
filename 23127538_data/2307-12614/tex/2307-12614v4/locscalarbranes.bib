   abstract = {We study two issues, the localization of various spin fields, and the problem of the cosmological constant on a brane in five-dimensional anti de Sitter space. We find that spin-zero fields are localized on a positive-tension brane. In addition to the localized zero-mode there is a continuous tower of states with no mass gap. Spin one-half and three-half states can be localized on a brane with 'negative tension'. Their localization can be achieved on the positive-tension brane as well, if additional interactions are introduced. The necessary ingredient of the scenario with localized gravity is the relation between the bulk cosmological constant and the brane tension. In the absence of supersymmetry this implies fine-tuning between the parameters of the theory. To deal with this issue we introduce a four-form gauge field. This gives an additional arbitrary contribution to the bulk cosmological constant. As a result, the model gives rise to a continuous family of brane Universe solutions for generic values of the bulk cosmological constant and the brane tension. Among these solutions there is one with a zero four-dimensional cosmological constant. (C) 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.},

   abstract = {A method for obtaining solutions to the classical equations for scalars plus gravity in five dimensions is applied to some recent suggestions for brane-world phenomenology. The method involves only first order differential equations. It is inspired by gauged supergravity but does not require supersymmetry. Our first application is a full nonlinear treatment of a recently studied stabilization mechanism for interbrane spacing. The spacing is uniquely determined after conventional fine-tuning to achieve a zero four-dimensional cosmological constant. If the fine-tuning is imperfect, there are solutions in which the four-dimensional branes are de Sitter or anti–de Sitter spacetimes. Our second application is a construction of smooth domain wall solutions which in a well-defined limit approach any desired array of sharply localized positive-tension branes. As an offshoot of the analysis we suggest a construction of a supergravity c function for nonsupersymmetric four-dimensional renormalization group flows. The equations for fluctuations about an arbitrary scalar-gravity background are also studied. It is shown that all models in which the fifth dimension is effectively compactified contain a massless graviton. The graviton is the constant mode in the fifth dimension. The separated wave equation can be recast into the form of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. The graviton wave function is then the supersymmetric ground state, and there are no tachyons. © 2000 The American Physical Society.},

   abstract = {In this paper we investigate the localization and mass spectra of various matter fields with spin 0, 1 and 1/2 on a geometric thick brane generated by pure four-dimensional (4D) and five-dimensional positive cosmological constants without bulk scalar fields. This model possesses a 4D cosmological constant that can be made as small as one desires without fine-tuning it with the bulk cosmological constant. The Randall-Sundrum model was obtained as an analytic continuation of the flat brane limit of this braneworld configuration when the Hubble parameter disappears. We also show that within the framework of this inflating braneworld model, it is possible to formulate a mechanism for obtaining TeV mass scales from Planck ones by adding a positive thin brane, where the Standard Model fields are trapped, located at a distance y2 from the origin, where the Planck thick brane resides. The brane separation must be of the same order as the inverse thickness parameter of the model in order for the mechanism to generate the desired hierarchy. This result is obtained by imposing the recovery of both the correct 4D gravitational couplings and the actually observed accelerated expansion of the Universe in our de Sitter braneworld. Regarding the localization of matter in the purely geometric thick braneworld, for spin-0 massless and massive scalar fields as well as for spin-1 vector fields, the potentials of the Kaluza-Klein (KK) modes in the corresponding Schrödinger equations are modified Pöschl-Teller potentials, which lead to the localization of the scalar and vector zero modes on the brane as well as to mass gaps in the mass spectra. We also compute the corrections to Coulomb's law coming from massive KK vector modes. For spin-1/2 fermions, we introduce the bulk mass term MF(z)Ψ̄Ψ in the action, and four different cases are investigated. Localization of the massless left-chiral fermion zero mode is feasible for just two cases of F(z). In the first one, we obtain Schrödinger equations with modified Pöschl-Teller potentials with the corresponding mass gaps for both left- and right-chiral fermions; the number of massive KK bound states is finite (determined by the ratio M/b) and is the same for left- and right-chiral modes. In the second case, we get a family of solutions with an infinite number of bound states where the mass spectra for left- and right-chiral KK fermion modes are discrete. A special case resembles the one-dimensional quantum harmonic oscillator problem. For both of these cases, the mass spectrum of right-chiral fermions is shifted with respect to the mass spectrum of the left-chiral ones. © 2013 American Physical Society.},

The sine–Gordon and Double sine–Gordon (DSG) branes are employed to produce different thick brane setups. In both scenarios, we include the bulk mass and non-minimally coupled terms in the global action and obtain some implications on the volcano-like potentials of the Kaluza–Klein modes associated to the corresponding Schrödinger-like equations. Also, we find that minimally and non-minimally coupled massive bulk scalar fields can be localized on SG and DSG branes if their bulk mass obeys an upper bound. Furthermore, it is shown that at the critical value of the non-minimal coupling constant the bulk scalar field cannot be localized on the branes.},

   abstract = {It is suggested that the nucleon mass arises largely as a self-energy of some primary fermion field through the same mechanism as the appearance of energy gap in the theory of superconductivity. The idea can be put into a mathematical formulation utilizing a generalized Hartree-Fock approximation which regards real nucleons as quasi-particle excitations. We consider a simplified model of nonlinear four-fermion interaction which allows a γ5-gauge group. An interesting consequence of the symmetry is that there arise automatically pseudoscalar zero-mass bound states of nucleon-antinucleon pair which may be regarded as an idealized pion. In addition, massive bound states of nucleon number zero and two are predicted in a simple approximation. The theory contains two parameters which can be explicitly related to observed nucleon mass and the pion-nucleon coupling constant. Some paradoxical aspects of the theory in connection with the γ5 transformation are discussed in detail. © 1961 The American Physical Society.},

It is shown that spin 0 and 2 fields are localized on a defect with the exponentially decreasing warp factor. Spin 1 field can be also localized on a defect with the exponentially decreasing warp factor. On the other hand, spin one-half and three-half fields can be localized on a defect with the exponentially increasing warp factor, provided that additional interactions are not introduced. Thus, some mechanism of localization must be invoked for these fermionic fields. These results are very similar to those of a domain wall in five space-time dimensions except the case of spin 1 field. © 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.},

   abstract = {The braneworld model provides a solution to the hierarchy problem in cosmology. Based on its thickness, braneworld models are classified into a thin brane model (RandallSundrum (RS) and the RS-like models) and a thick brane model. The thin brane model has a problem according to the zero-width brane and some fields localization. Meanwhile, thick brane is quite good in explaining fields localization and there is no problem related to brane thickness. In this article, we re-examine the thick brane in a modified gravity, that is f(R,T) gravity. The equation of motion for the y-dependence scalar field and the f(R,T) field equation for a conformally flat brane and Robertson-Walker brane are derived. We also investigate the localization of scalar field on the f(R,T) thick brane, for a specific f(R,T) form. As the results, the formulation of Robertson-Walker thick brane is obtained. It can be reduced and has similarities to the previous f(R,T) brane consideration. It has a possibility to trap the field φ(y) in a thick brane with specific conditions of brane's scale factor. It was shown that the expanding or contracting universe affects the localization conditions of the scalar fields.},

We study the localization properties of fundamental fields which are coupled to one another through the gauge mechanism both in the original Randall-Sundrum (RS) and in the modified Randall-Sundrum (MRS) braneworld models: scalar-vector, vector-vector, and spinor-vector configuration systems. For this purpose, we derive conditions of localization, namely, the finiteness of integrals over the extra coordinate in the action of the system considered. We also derive field equations for each of the systems and then obtain their solutions corresponding to the extra dimension by a separation of variable method for every field involved in each system. We then insert the obtained solutions into the conditions of localization to seek whether or not the solutions are in accordance with the conditions of localization. We obtain that not all of the configuration systems considered are localizable on the brane of the original RS model while, on the contrary, they are localizable on the MRS braneworld model with some restrictions. In terms of field localizability on the brane, this result shows that the MRS model is much better than the original RS model.},

The localization of the U(1) gauge field is important because it plays a fundamental role in the branworld theories. To achieve the localization, we propose a novel action with a non-minimal coupling between the U(1) gauge field and gravity. We find that the mass spectrum of the gauge field is continuous, without any gap between the zero-mass mode and the massive modes, and except for the zero-mass mode all the massive modes are not localized on the brane. Furthermore, the massive modes have negative squared masses, indicating they are tachyonic. Our analysis can be applied to a wide range of thin and thick braneworld scenarios, provided that the five-dimensional spacetime is asymptotically anti-de Sitter.},

We find that the nonlinear spinor field supports a class of soliton configurations which could be viewed as a wall embedded in five dimensions. We begin with an illuminating solution of the spinor field in the absence of gravitation. In a further investigation, we exhibit three sets of solutions of the spinor field with nonconstant curvature bulk spacetimes and three sets of solutions corresponding to three constant curvature bulk spacetimes. We demonstrate that some of these solutions in specific conditions have the energy density distributions of domain walls for the spinor field, where the scalar curvature is regular everywhere. Therefore, the configurations of these walls can be interpreted as spinor walls which are interesting spinor field realizations of domain walls. In order to investigate the stability of these spinor configurations, the linear perturbations are considered. The localization of the zero mode of tensor perturbation is also discussed.},

This thick brane is not capable of providing a normalizable zero mode for both gauge and Kalb Ramond fields. To overcome this problem, we propose two distinct types of gauge-invariant couplings. In the first coupling, the fields are minimally coupled to the scalar field responsible for generating the thick brane. In the second coupling, we use the geometric coupling in which the fields are non-minimally coupled to torsion. Another issue that we investigate is resonant modes, which allow us to understand the massive spectrum of fields. Indeed we note that an internal structure appears for the Kalb–Ramond massive solutions and both couplings show resonant modes of the massive spectrum.},
