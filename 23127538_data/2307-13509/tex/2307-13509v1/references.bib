The main characteristics of the functional Mahalanobis semidistance are shown. To illustrate the applicability of this measure of proximity between functional observations, new versions of several well-known functional classification procedures are developed using the functional Mahalanobis semidistance. A Monte Carlo study and the analysis of two real examples indicate that the classification methods used in conjunction with the functional Mahalanobis semidistance give better results than other well-known functional classification procedures.

abstract={The minimum covariance determinant (MCD) approach estimates the location and scatter matrix using the subset of given size with lowest sample covariance determinant. Its main drawback is that it cannot be applied when the dimension exceeds the subset size. We propose the minimum regularized covariance determinant (MRCD) approach, which differs from the MCD in that the scatter matrix is a convex combination of a target matrix and the sample covariance matrix of the subset. A data-driven procedure sets the weight of the target matrix, so that the regularization is only used when needed. The MRCD estimator is defined in any dimension, is well-conditioned by construction and preserves the good robustness properties of the MCD. We prove that so-called concentration steps can be performed to reduce the MRCD objective function, and we exploit this fact to construct a fast algorithm. We verify the accuracy and robustness of the MRCD estimator in a simulation study and illustrate its practical use for outlier detection and regression analysis on real-life high-dimensional data sets in chemistry and criminology.},

abstract="For many reasons, principal components analysis (PCA) of functional data is a key technique to consider. First, our own experience is that, after the preliminary steps of registering and displaying the data, the user wants to explore that data to see the features characterizing typical functions. Some of these features are expected to be there, for example the sinusoidal nature of temperature curves, but other aspects may be surprising. Some indication of the complexity of the data is also required, in the sense of how many types of curves and characteristics are to be found. Principal components analysis serves these ends admirably, and it is perhaps also for these reasons that it was the first method to be considered in the early literature on FDA.",

This approach allows for smooth functions of age, is robust for outlying years due to wars and epidemics, and provides a modelling framework that is easily adapted to allow for constraints and other information. Ideas from functional data analysis, nonparametric smoothing and robust statistics are combined to form a methodology that is widely applicable to any functional time series data observed discretely and possibly with error. The model is a generalization of the Lee–Carter (LC) model commonly used in mortality and fertility forecasting. The methodology is applied to French mortality data and Australian fertility data, and the forecasts obtained are shown to be superior to those from the LC method and several of its variants.}

We start by investigating the relationship between the spatio-temporal dependence and the 1.5 times the 50\% central region empirical outlier detection rule. Then, we propose to simulate observations without outliers on the basis of a robust estimator of the covariance function of the data. We select the constant factor in the functional boxplot to control the probability of correctly detecting no outliers. Finally, we apply the selected factor to the functional boxplot of the original data. As applications, the factor selection procedure and the adjusted functional boxplots are demonstrated on sea surface temperatures, spatio-temporal precipitation and general circulation model (GCM) data. The outlier detection performance is also compared before and after the factor adjustment. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

The main difficulties stem from an underlying inverse problem as well as from dependence between the data. Traditional facts about weak convergence in non-parametric models appear: the normalizing sequence is not an On, a bias term appears. Several original features of the functional framework are pointed out.}

Identifying magnitude outliers is relatively easy, while detecting shape outliers is much more challenging. We propose turning the shape outliers into magnitude outliers through data transformation and detecting them using the functional boxplot. Besides easing the detection procedure, applying several transformations sequentially provides a reasonable taxonomy for the flagged outliers. A joint functional ranking, which consists of several transformations, is also defined here. Simulation studies are carried out to evaluate the performance of the proposed method using different functional depth notions. Interesting results are obtained in several practical applications.}

So the setting is quite similar to that of the classical one-way anova model but the k samples under study consist of functional data. A simple natural test for this problem is proposed. It can be seen as an asymptotic version of the well-known anova F-test. The asymptotic validity of the method is shown. A numerical Monte Carlo procedure is proposed to handle in practice the asymptotic distribution of the test statistic. A simulation study is included and a real-data example in experimental cardiology is considered in some detail.}

@article{Berkey1991,
abstract = {Tracking of blood pressure in adolescent boys is investigated using a mathematical model that corresponds to progression along a constant percentile. A more general analysis, based on the method of principal components, is also proposed that determines various alternative tracks or patterns that are most prevalent in the longitudinal blood pressure data. The degree of tracking along a constant percentile curve for systolic pressure was moderately high, as evidenced by a tracking index of .78 explaining 81 of the variance, but less strong for diastolic (tracking index of .60) where tracking along a percentile explained 66 of the variance. The value of the more general analysis of blood pressure patterns may lie in the assessment of adolescent risk factors for elevated adult blood pressure. Using adolescent patterns determined by either statistical model, adult systolic at age 38 was predicted (R2 = .22) by the concept of a systolic fixed percentile curve in adolescence, and similarly for diastolic (R2 = .21). However, the more general analysis based on longitudinal principal components further suggests that boys who have a larger than usual systolic peak at age 14 years, which is near the time of the adolescent physical growth spurt in these boys, may be more likely to have higher systolic pressures at age 38. Because the adult data were incomplete and highly unbalanced, these findings were obtained using random-effects models for longitudinal data.},

As a result, archaeological excavations in the historical centre of Antwerp have yielded a number of important glass finds from the 15th until the 17th century. Within this extensive collection, several typological categories of glass vessels can be distinguished. The major and trace composition of a series of 96 representative glass objects was determined by means of EPXMA (electron probe X-ray micro analysis) and $\mu$-SRXRF (synchroton radiation induced X-ray fluorescence analysis). Four major compositional types could be distinguished. The correlation between object composition, colour and type is discussed. Special emphasis is placed on the composition of the fa{\c{c}}on-de-Venise or Venetian glass objects found in Antwerp and on the comparison of this composition to that of glass of the same type found in other locations in Europe.",

abstract={In this paper we review existing methods for robust functional principal component analysis (FPCA) and propose a new method for FPCA that can be applied to longitudinal data where only a few observations per trajectory are available. This method is robust against the presence of atypical observations, and can also be used to derive a new non-robust FPCA approach for sparsely observed functional data. We use local regression to estimate the values of the covariance function, taking advantage of the fact that for elliptically distributed random vectors the conditional location parameter of some of its components given others is a linear function of the conditioning set. This observation allows us to obtain robust FPCA estimators by using robust local regression methods. The finite sample performance of our proposal is explored through a simulation study that shows that, as expected, the robust method outperforms existing alternatives when the data are contaminated. Furthermore, we also see that for samples that do not contain outliers the non-robust variant of our proposal compares favourably to the existing alternative in the literature. A real data example is also presented.},

ABSTRACT = {The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a well-known cause of year-to-year climatic variations on Earth. Floods, droughts, and other natural disasters have been linked to the ENSO in various parts of the world. Hence, modeling the ENSO’s effects and the anomaly of the ENSO phenomenon has become a main research interest. Statistical methods, including linear and nonlinear models, have intensively been used in modeling the ENSO index. However, these models are unable to capture sufficient information on ENSO index variability, particularly on its temporal aspects. Hence, this study adopted functional data analysis theory by representing a multivariate ENSO index (MEI) as functional data in climate applications. This study included the functional principal component, which is purposefully designed to find new functions that reveal the most important type of variation in the MEI curve. Simultaneously, graphical methods were also used to visualize functional data and capture outliers that may not have been apparent from the original data plot. The findings suggest that the outliers obtained from the functional plot are then related to the El Niño and La Niña phenomena. In conclusion, the functional framework was found to be more flexible in representing the climate phenomenon as a whole.},

We show how Tikhonov's regularization method, which in its original formulation involves a least squares problem, can be recast in a total least squares formulation suited for problems in which both the coefficient matrix and the right-hand side are known only approximately. We analyze the regularizing properties of this method and demonstrate by a numerical example that, in certain cases with large perturbations, the new method is superior to standard regularization methods. }

	Abstract = {To provide a parsimonious generative representation of the sequential activity of a number of individuals within a population there is a necessary tradeoff between the definition of individual specific and global 
representations. A linear-time algorithm is proposed that defines a distributed predictive model for finite state symbolic sequences which represent the traces of the activity of a number of individuals within a group. The algorithm is based on a straightforward generalization of latent Dirichlet allocation to time-invariant Markov chains of arbitrary order. The modelling assumption made is that the possibly heterogeneous behavior of individuals may be represented by a relatively small number of simple and common behavioral traits which may interleave randomly according to an individual-specific distribution. The results of an empirical study on three different application domains indicate that this modelling approach provides an efficient low-complexity and intuitively interpretable representation scheme which is reflected by improved prediction performance over comparable models.},
	Annote = {Builds a mixed-membership model where the basis profiles are markov chains of varying order. 
Uses two types of estimation: Variational approximation, and "maximum a posteriori" (MAP)
Fits model on 3 different data sets of user-log data: actions in a word processor, sequences of calls to different geographic regions (UK), and finally web page browsing. 

Compares models on "perplexity" which they define as the exponential of the negative-normalized log-likelihood.  (Might be a standard markov-chain goodness of fit measure, or it might be more standard to ML)
They use t-tests and non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests to test for significant differences in perplexity.

They call their model a "simplical mixture of markov chains" and cite Minka and Lafferty 2002. 

For the zero^th order Markov model (when no memory is assumed in the markov process), then their model reduces to a multinomial LDA model. 

They also claim that Hofmann's pLSA algorithm is equivalent to LDA when the MAP estimator is calculated through an iterative convergence method. Suggests that LDA is an improvement over pLSA because of the estimation method used.  Cites Lappalainen and Miskin (2000) on the weakness of MAP estimators. 

For all the data sets, the mixed-membership model offers better results. Better on the goodness-of-fit measures and more interpretable results.  The differences were clearer on the bigger data sets with larger state-spaces. 

Data Structure:  only 1 item per model - the sequences (J=1)
	many replications of each item (big R) 

They offer some additional comments on computational algorithms and computational time.},

abstract = {Summary A Bayes linear space is a linear space of equivalence classes of proportional σ-finite measures, including probability measures. Measures are identified with their density functions. Addition is given by Bayes' rule and substraction by Radon–Nikodym derivatives. The present contribution shows the subspace of square-log-integrable densities to be a Hilbert space, which can include probability and infinite measures, measures on the whole real line or discrete measures. It extends the ideas from the Hilbert space of densities on a finite support towards Hilbert spaces on general measure spaces. It is also a generalisation of the Euclidean structure of the simplex, the sample space of random compositions. In this framework, basic notions of mathematical statistics get a simple algebraic interpretation. A key tool is the centred-log-ratio transformation, a generalization of that used in compositional data analysis, which maps the Hilbert space of measures into a subspace of square-integrable functions. As a consequence of this structure, distances between densities, orthonormal bases, and Fourier series representing measures become available. As an application, Fourier series of normal distributions and distances between them are derived, and an example related to grain size distributions is presented. The geometry of the sample space of random compositions, known as Aitchison geometry of the simplex, is obtained as a particular case of the Hilbert space when the measures have discrete and finite support.},
