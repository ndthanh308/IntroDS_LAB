\begin{abstract}
%Studies have shown that toxic behavior can cause contributors to leave and hinder newcomers' participation in Open Source Software (OSS) projects, especially from underrepresented communities. Thus, understanding and detecting patterns of toxic language play a crucial role in fostering OSS collaboration and inclusivity. The distinct nature of toxicity observed in OSS communities makes the use of general-purpose tools and techniques developed in other domains ineffective (e.g., entitlement and arrogance are more frequently observed on GitHub than on Reddit or Twitter). To get a fresh look at toxicity from the perspective of morality, we leverage Moral Foundations Theory to explore moral principles in the context of Software Engineering toxic communications, to analyze and understand moralities exhibited in GitHub issue threads, and to find their association to toxicity. 
%However, the distinct nature of software-engineering text and the nature of toxicity observed in OSS communities makes it challenging to use general-purpose toxicity detectors developed in other domains. 
To foster collaboration and inclusivity in Open Source Software (OSS) projects, it is crucial to understand and detect patterns of toxic language that may drive contributors away, especially those from underrepresented communities. 
Although machine learning-based toxicity detection tools trained on domain-specific data have shown promise, their design lacks an understanding of the unique nature and triggers of toxicity in OSS discussions, highlighting the need for further investigation.
In this study, we employ Moral Foundations Theory to examine the relationship between moral principles and toxicity in OSS. Specifically, we analyze toxic communications in GitHub issue threads to identify and understand five types of moral principles exhibited in text, and explore their potential association with toxic behavior. Our preliminary findings suggest a possible link between moral principles and toxic comments in OSS communications, with each moral principle associated with at least one type of toxicity. The potential of MFT in toxicity detection warrants further investigation. 
%Our preliminary results show that moral principles are exhibited in OSS, and how they are associated with different natures of toxic behaviors.
