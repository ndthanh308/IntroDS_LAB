	abstract = {The possible relationship between widespread unauthorized copying of microcomputer software (also known as software piracy) and level of moral judgment is examined through analysis of over 350 survey questionnaires that included the Defining Issues Test as a measure of moral development. It is hypothesized that the higher one's level of moral judgment, the less likely that one will approve of or engage in unauthorized copying. Analysis of the data indicate a high level of tolerance toward unauthorized copying and limited support for the hypothesis. The most plausible explanation for these findings is that software copying is perceived as an issue of low moral intensity. This study calls into question the software industry's strategy of concentrating exclusively on institutional compliance with copyright rules, rather than working to raise the perceived moral intensity about software piracy at the individual level. As long as the issue remains low in moral intensity, the industry cannot expect significant shifts in copying behaviors. Individuals must become more aware of and concerned about the nature and magnitude of harm to society and to the rightful copyright owners from unauthorized copying before their attitudes and behaviors come to reflect higher levels of moral judgment.},

In this paper, we try to disentangle ethical considerations that can be performed at the level of the software engineer from those that belong in the wider domain of business ethics. The handling of ethical problems that fall into the responsibility of the engineer has traditionally been addressed by the publication of Codes of Ethics and Conduct. We argue that these Codes are barely able to provide normative orientation in software development. The main contribution of this paper is, thus, to analyze the normative features of Codes of Ethics in software engineering and to explicate how their value-based approach might prevent their usefulness from a normative perspective. Codes of Conduct cannot replace ethical deliberation because they do not and cannot offer guidance because of their underdetermined nature. This lack of orientation, we argue, triggers reactive behavior such as “cherry-picking,” “risk of indifference,” “ex-post orientation,” and the “desire to rely on gut feeling.” In the light of this, we propose to implement ethical deliberation within software development teams as a way out.},

Graduate curricula have been defined under the sponsorship of the Department of Defense through the Software Engineering Institute.

These advances in education have been matched by the evolution of the principles of software engineering. New software development models have emerged and levels of software development have been carefully delineated. There is, however, a surprising lacuna in software engineering education, one of whose primary foci is the preparation of software professionals for the commercial market. Software engineering education has been responsive to most of the needs of industry, and yet there is at least one significant place where that responsiveness is wanting and industry has had to fend for itself.},

Principles of openness, truth, freedom and progress, which are also understood as central to the technical production of good software, are reinforced (as a ethical orientation) by their contribution to making ‘good’ software. A reciprocal dynamic ensues in which better software is seen as dependent on particular social practices and ideologies while these practices and ideologies are given salience by their success in fostering valuable production. Processes key to the generation of this social form are examined before a number of key features of the practice of programming, such as its often combative and individualistic character, and an absence of women in developer communities, are considered in the light of the analysis.},

At that level of abstraction, a moral dimension is undoubtedly at play: when our technology touches the activities of the human spirit, then questions of social responsibility, individual rights, and goodness of fit to the moral atmosphere of the surrounding community come alive. Should we enable technology that allows tracking an individual's activities to a high degree of fidelity? Should we permit unfettered access to all information? On the other hand, should we allow complete digital anonymity? Should the transport and storage of bits be an essentially free utility? These, and many other questions, are rooted in technology, which by itself is neither good nor evil; it's the use of that technology that brings us to the moral dimension.},

However, a knowledge gap exists in our understanding of which neutralization techniques most influence software piracy intention. To address this gap, we developed a model that explains the effects of neutralization techniques on software piracy intention. We included different types of deterrents (formal sanctions, shame, and moral belief) in our model because individuals may use neutralization techniques to mitigate feelings of guilt and shame, which, subsequently, reduce the deterrent effect. Our empirical results (for 183 people surveyed) showed that appeal to higher loyalties and condemn the condemners strongly predict software piracy intentions. In addition, informal deterrents such as shame and moral beliefs are strong predictors. These findings suggest that anti-piracy efforts should involve educational intervention aimed at addressing these two neutralization techniques rather than relying on formal sanctions.},

However, that is not the only charge that propels contributions-growing interest in open source has also been attributed to software developers deciding to use their technical skills to benefit a common societal good. To understand how developers identify these projects, their motivations for contributing, and challenges they face, we conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with {OSS} for Social Good ({OSS}4SG) contributors. From our interview analysis, we identified themes of contribution styles that we wanted to understand at scale by deploying a survey to over 5765 {OSS} and Open Source Software for Social Good contributors. From our quantitative analysis of 517 responses, we find that the majority of contributors demonstrate a distinction between {OSS}4SG and {OSS}. Likewise, contributors described definitions based on what societal issue the project was to mitigate and who the outcomes of the project were going to benefit. In addition, we find that {OSS}4SG contributors focus less on benefiting themselves by padding their resume with new technology skills and are more interested in leaving their mark on society at statistically significant levels. We also find that {OSS}4SG contributors evaluate the owners of the project significantly more than {OSS} contributors. These findings inform implications to help contributors identify high societal impact projects, help project maintainers reduce barriers to entry, and help organizations understand why contributors are drawn to these projects to sustain active participation.},

The study referenced in this chapter provides an example of an ethnographic, practice-based research setting. While asking, ‘How do organisational practices enable professional agency?’ the questions, ‘What agency-enabling practices are in the organisation?’ and ‘What kind of professional virtues do these practices enable?’ are discussed. As a result, four practices that enable professional agency were identified: democracy, experimentation, self-directed development and independent project teams. The focus on the moral dimension of work challenges us to think about professional agency in relation to the virtues of a professional practice: This chapter emphasizes that the pursuit of meaningful work is not solely about the asset of universal best practices but also about the virtues important to a particular group of professionals in a particular organisation. As the organisation studied was an award-winning workplace recognized for employee well-being and satisfaction, the findings of this study suggest that one element of a great place to work is the fact that the organisation’s practices provide space for a virtue-driven professional agency, and that these organisational practices have formed with respect to professional virtues. To create a great workplace, organisations should see themselves as spaces for professional agency, enabling such work conditions that it is possible for professionals’ virtues to guide their work.},

The issue of improvement in software quality is proposed to relate to fundamental ethical issues that need to be addressed by software developers. The author explores various philosophical ethical theories to address this issue including Aristotelian virtue ethics, and Humean virtue ethics, settling on Humean virtue ethics as the most effective approach.

Although, several general purpose tools exist to identify toxic contents, those may incorrectly flag some words commonly used in the Software Engineering ({SE}) context as toxic (e.g., 'junk', 'kill', and 'dump') and vice versa. To encounter this challenge, an {SE} specific tool has been proposed by the {CMU} Strudel Lab (referred as the `{STRUDEL}' hereinafter) by combining the output of the Perspective {API} with the output from a customized version of the Stanford's Politeness detector tool. However, since {STRUDEL}'s evaluation was very limited with only 654 {SE} text, its practical applicability is unclear. Therefore, this study aims to empirically evaluate the Strudel tool as well as four state-of-the-art general purpose toxicity detectors on a large scale {SE} dataset. On this goal, we empirically developed a rubric to manually label toxic {SE} interactions. Using this rubric, we manually labeled a dataset of 6,533 code review comments and 4,140 Gitter messages. The results of our analyses suggest significant degradation of all tools' performances on our datasets. Those degradations were significantly higher on our dataset of formal {SE} communication such as code review than on our dataset of informal communication such as Gitter messages. Two of the models from our study showed significant performance improvements during 10-fold cross validations after we retrained those on our {SE} datasets. Based on our manual investigations of the incorrectly classified text, we have identified several recommendations for developing an {SE} specific toxicity detector.},

For example, victims of toxic conversations may become afraid to express themselves, therefore get demotivated, and may eventually leave the project. Automated filtering of toxic conversations may help a {FOSS} community to maintain healthy interactions among its members. However, off-the-shelf toxicity detectors perform poorly on Software Engineering ({SE}) dataset, such as one curated from code review comments. To encounter this challenge, we present {ToxiCR}, a supervised learning-based toxicity identification tool for code review interactions. {ToxiCR} includes a choice to select one of the ten supervised learning algorithms, an option to select text vectorization techniques, eight preprocessing steps, and a large scale labeled dataset of 19,571 code review comments. Two out of those eight preprocessing steps are {SE} domain specific. With our rigorous evaluation of the models with various combinations of preprocessing steps and vectorization techniques, we have identified the best combination for our dataset that boosts 95.8\% accuracy and 88.9\% F1 score. {ToxiCR} significantly outperforms existing toxicity detectors on our dataset.

	abstract = {Although issues of open source software are created to discuss and solve technical problems, conversations can become heated, with discussants getting angry and/or agitated for a variety of reasons, such as poor suggestions or violation of community conventions. To prevent and mitigate discussions from getting heated, tools like {GitHub} have introduced the ability to lock issue discussions that violate the code of conduct or other community guidelines. Despite some early research on locked issues, there is a lack of understanding of how communities use this feature and of potential threats to validity for researchers relying on a dataset of locked issues as an oracle for heated discussions. To address this gap, we (i) quantitatively analyzed 79 {GitHub} projects that have at least one issue locked as too heated, and (ii) qualitatively analyzed all issues locked as too heated of the 79 projects, a total of 205 issues comprising 5,511 comments. We found that projects have different behaviors when locking issues: while 54 locked less than 10\% of their closed issues, 14 projects locked more than 90\% of their closed issues. Additionally, locked issues tend to have a similar number of comments, participants, and emoji reactions to non-locked issues. For the 205 issues locked as too heated, we found that one-third do not contain any uncivil discourse, and only 8.82\% of the analyzed comments are actually uncivil. Finally, we found that the locking justifications provided by maintainers do not always match the label used to lock the issue. Based on our results, we identified three pitfalls to avoid when using the {GitHub} locked issues data and we provide recommendations for researchers and practitioners.},

	abstract = {Given the democratic nature of open source development, code review and issue discussions may be uncivil. Incivility, defined as features of discussion that convey an unnecessarily disrespectful tone, can have negative consequences to open source communities. To prevent or minimize these negative consequences, open source platforms have included mechanisms for removing uncivil language from the discussions. However, such approaches require manual inspection, which can be overwhelming given the large number of discussions. To help open source communities deal with this problem, in this paper, we aim to compare six classical machine learning models with {BERT} to detect incivility in open source code review and issue discussions. Furthermore, we assess if adding contextual information improves the models’ performance and how well the models perform in a cross-platform setting. We found that {BERT} performs better than classical machine learning models, with a best F1-score of 0.95. Furthermore, classical machine learning models tend to underperform to detect non-technical and civil discussions. Our results show that adding the contextual information to {BERT} did not improve its performance, and that none of the analyzed classifiers had an outstanding performance in a cross-platform setting. Finally, we provide insights on the tones that the classifiers misclassify.},

	abstract = {Code review is an important quality assurance activity for software development. Code review discussions among developers and maintainers can be heated and sometimes involve personal attacks and unnecessary disrespectful comments, demonstrating, therefore, incivility. Although incivility in public discussions has received increasing attention from researchers in different domains, the knowledge about the characteristics, causes, and consequences of uncivil communication is still very limited in the context of software development, and more specifically, code review. To address this gap in the literature, we leverage the mature social construct of incivility as a lens to understand confrontational conflicts in open source code review discussions. For that, we conducted a qualitative analysis on 1,545 emails from the Linux Kernel Mailing List ({LKML}) that were associated with rejected changes. We found that more than half 66.66\% of the non-technical emails included uncivil features. Particularly, frustration, name calling, and impatience are the most frequent features in uncivil emails. We also found that there are civil alternatives to address arguments, while uncivil comments can potentially be made by any people when discussing any topic. Finally, we identified various causes and consequences of such uncivil communication. Our work serves as the first study about the phenomenon of in(civility) in open source software development, paving the road for a new field of research about collaboration and communication in the context of software engineering activities.},

For example, toxic code review comments may raise pushback from an author to complete suggested changes. A toxic communication with another person may hamper future communication and collaboration. Research also suggests that toxicity disproportionately impacts newcomers, women, and other participants from marginalized groups. Therefore, toxicity is a barrier to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion. Since the occurrence of toxic communications is not uncommon among FOSS communities and such communications may have serious repercussions, the primary objective of my proposed dissertation is to automatically identify and mitigate toxicity during developers’ textual interactions. On this goal, I aim to: i) build an automated toxicity detector for Software Engineering (SE) domain, ii) identify the notion of toxicity across demographics, and iii) analyze the impacts of toxicity on the outcomes of Open Source Software (OSS) projects.},

Research has shown that offensive language drives users away from active engagement within these platforms. This work aims to explore this issue more broadly by investigating the nature of offensive language in comments posted by users in four prominent {SE} platforms – {GitHub}, Gitter, Slack and Stack Overflow ({SO}). It proposes an approach to detect and classify offensive language in {SE} communities by adopting natural language processing and deep learning techniques. Further, a Conflict Reduction System ({CRS}), which identifies offence and then suggests what changes could be made to minimize offence has been proposed. Beyond showing the prevalence of offensive language in over 1 million comments from four different communities which ranges from 0.07\% to 0.43\%, our results show promise in successful detection and classification of such language. The {CRS} system has the potential to drastically reduce manual moderation efforts to detect and reduce offence in {SE} communities.},

The authors also offer guidance for research in the field (where, they say, naturalistic inquiry always takes place). Useful tips are given, for example, on "designing" a study as it unfolds, establishing "trustworthiness," and writing a case report. This book helps researchers "both to understand and to do naturalistic inquiry."

To be accepted as trustworthy, qualitative researchers must demonstrate that data analysis has been conducted in a precise, consistent, and exhaustive manner through recording, systematizing , and disclosing the methods of analysis with enough detail to enable the reader to determine whether the process is credible. Although there are numerous examples of how to conduct qualitative research, few sophisticated tools are available to researchers for conducting a rigorous and relevant thematic analysis. The purpose of this article is to guide researchers using thematic analysis as a research method. We offer personal insights and practical examples, while exploring issues of rigor and trustworthiness. The process of conducting a thematic analysis is illustrated through the presentation of an auditable decision trail, guiding interpreting and representing textual data. We detail our step-by-step approach to exploring the effectiveness of strategic clinical networks in Alberta, Canada, in our mixed methods case study.

In a series of studies, we find evidence in support of this hypothesis using language from a diverse array of contexts, including the use of hateful language in propaganda to inspire genocide (Study 1), hateful slurs as they occur in large text corpora across a multitude of languages (Study 2), and hate speech on social-media platforms (Study 3). In post-hoc analyses focusing on particular moral concerns, we found that language about purity and spiritual degradation were strongly salient in hateful linguistic communication. Our findings provide a new lens for understanding the psychological underpinnings of out-group hate and its associated behaviors, with practical implications for  mitigating hateful rhetoric online.},

This trend is affecting users mentally and as a result they tend to leave Twitter and other such social networking sites thus depleting the active user base. In this paper, we study factors associated with incivility. We observe that the act of incivility is highly correlated with the opinion differences between the account holder (i.e., the user writing the incivil tweet) and the target (i.e., the user for whom the incivil tweet is meant for or targeted), toward a named entity. We introduce a character level {CNN} model and incorporate the entity-specific sentiment information for efficient incivility detection which significantly outperforms multiple baseline methods achieving an impressive accuracy of 93.3\% (4.9\% improvement over the best baseline). In a post-hoc analysis, we also study the behavioral aspects of the targets and account holders and try to understand the reasons behind the incivility incidents. Interestingly, we observe that there are strong signals of repetitions in incivil behavior. In particular, we find that there are a significant fraction of account holders who act as repeat offenders - attacking the targets even more than 10 times. Similarly, there are also targets who get targeted multiple times. In general, the targets are found to have higher reputation scores than the account holders.},

While the majority of people in the United States support wearing face masks as an effective tool to combat {COVID}-19, a smaller percentage declared the recommendation by public health agencies as a government imposition and an infringement on personal liberty. Social media play a significant role in amplifying public health issues, whereby a minority against the imposition can speak loudly, perhaps using tactics of verbal aggression taking the form of toxic language. We investigated the role that toxicity plays in the online discourse around wearing face masks. Overall, we found tweets including anti-mask hashtags were significantly more likely to use toxic language, while tweets with pro-mask hashtags were somewhat less toxic with the exception of \#{WearADamnMask}. We conclude that the tensions between these two positions raise doubt and uncertainty around the issue, which make it difficult for health communicators to break through the clutter in order to combat the infodemic. Public health agencies and other governmental institutions should monitor toxicity trends on social media in order to better ascertain prevailing sentiment toward their recommendations and then apply these data-driven insights to refine and adapt their risk communication messaging toward mask wearing, vaccine uptake, and other interventions.},

Our analysis results drew a complex picture of the relationships between, on the one hand, the sentiments and tones in the issue discussions, and on the other hand, various discussion and development-related measures such as the discussion length and the issue resolution time. We also found that when factors such as the issue poster roles and the issue types were controlled, sentiments and tones had varied associations with the measures.

In this mixed-methods study at one company, we surveyed 1,317 developers to characterize the negative experiences and cross-referenced the results with objective data from code review logs to predict these experiences. Our results suggest that such negative experiences, which we call "pushback", are relatively rare in practice, but have negative repercussions when they occur. Our metrics can predict feelings of pushback with high recall but low precision, making them potentially appropriate for highlighting interactions that may benefit from a self-intervention.},

	shorttitle = {Do I Belong?},
	abstract = {The sense of belonging to a community is a basic human need that impacts an individuals behavior, long-term engagement, and job satisfaction, as revealed by research in disciplines such as psychology, healthcare, and education. Despite much research on how to retain developers in Open Source Software projects and other virtual, peer-production communities, there is a paucity of research investigating what might contribute to a sense of belonging in these communities. To that end, we develop a theoretical model that seeks to understand the link between {OSS} developer motives and a Sense of Virtual Community. We test the model with a dataset collected in the Linux Kernel developer community, using structural equation modeling techniques. Our results for this case study show that intrinsic motivations - social or hedonic motives - are positively associated with a sense of virtual community, but living in an authoritative country and being paid to contribute can reduce the sense of virtual community. Based on these results, we offer suggestions for open source projects to foster a sense of virtual community, with a view to retaining contributors and improving projects sustainability.},

	abstract = {Personality plays a pivotal role in our understanding of human actions and behavior. Today, the applications of personality are widespread, built on the solutions from psychology to infer personality. In software engineering, for instance, one widely used solution to infer personality uses textual communication data. As studies on personality in software engineering continue to grow, it is imperative to understand the performance of these solutions. This paper compares the inferential ability of three widely studied text-based personality tests against each other and the ground truth on {GitHub}. We explore the challenges and potential solutions to improve the inferential ability of personality tests. Our study shows that solutions for inferring personality are far from being perfect. Software engineering communications data can infer individual developer personality with an average error rate of 41\%. In the best case, the error rate can be reduced up to 36\% by following our recommendations.},

	abstract = {Assessing the personality of software engineers may help to match individual traits with the characteristics of development activities such as code review and testing, as well as support managers in team composition. However, self-assessment questionnaires are not a practical solution for collecting multiple observations on a large scale. Instead, automatic personality detection, while overcoming these limitations, is based on off-the-shelf solutions trained on non-technical corpora, which might not be readily applicable to technical domains like Software Engineering ({SE}). In this paper, we first assess the performance of general-purpose personality detection tools when applied to a technical corpus of developers' emails retrieved from the public archives of the Apache Software Foundation. We observe a general low accuracy of predictions and an overall disagreement among the tools. Second, we replicate two previous research studies in {SE} by replacing the personality detection tool used to infer developers' personalities from pull-request discussions and emails. We observe that the original results are not confirmed, i.e., changing the tool used in the original study leads to diverging conclusions. Our results suggest a need for personality detection tools specially targeted for the software engineering domain.},
