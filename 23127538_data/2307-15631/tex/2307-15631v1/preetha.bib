    abstract = "Language toxicity identification presents a gray area in the ethical debate surrounding freedom of speech and censorship. Today{'}s social media landscape is littered with unfiltered content that can be anywhere from slightly abusive to hate inducing. In response, we focused on training a multi-label classifier to detect both the type and level of toxicity in online content. This content is typically colloquial and conversational in style. Its classification therefore requires huge amounts of annotated data due to its variability and inconsistency. We compare standard methods of text classification in this task. A conventional one-vs-rest SVM classifier with character and word level frequency-based representation of text reaches 0.9763 ROC AUC score. We demonstrated that leveraging more advanced technologies such as word embeddings, recurrent neural networks, attention mechanism, stacking of classifiers and semi-supervised training can improve the ROC AUC score of classification to 0.9862. We suggest that in order to choose the right model one has to consider the accuracy of models as well as inference complexity based on the application.",

    abstract = "Workplace communication (e.g. email, chat, etc.) is a central part of enterprise productivity. Healthy conversations are crucial for creating an inclusive environment and maintaining harmony in an organization. Toxic communications at the workplace can negatively impact overall job satisfaction and are often subtle, hidden, or demonstrate human biases. The linguistic subtlety of mild yet hurtful conversations has made it difficult for researchers to quantify and extract toxic conversations automatically. While offensive language or hate speech has been extensively studied in social communities, there has been little work studying toxic communication in emails. Specifically, the lack of corpus, sparsity of toxicity in enterprise emails, and well-defined criteria for annotating toxic conversations have prevented researchers from addressing the problem at scale. We take the first step towards studying toxicity in workplace emails by providing (1) a general and computationally viable taxonomy to study toxic language at the workplace (2) a dataset to study toxic language at the workplace based on the taxonomy and (3) analysis on why offensive language and hate-speech datasets are not suitable to detect workplace toxicity.",

abstract="In this paper, we present an analysis of more than 500 K comments from open-source repositories of software systems developed using agile methodologies. Our aim is to empirically determine how developers interact with each other under certain psychological conditions generated by politeness, sentiment and emotion expressed within developers' comments. Developers involved in an open-source projects do not usually know each other; they mainly communicate through mailing lists, chat, and tools such as issue tracking systems. The way in which they communicate affects the development process and the productivity of the people involved in the project. We evaluated politeness, sentiment and emotions of comments posted by agile developers and studied the communication flow to understand how they interacted in the presence of impolite and negative comments (and vice versa). Our analysis shows that ``firefighters'' prevail. When in presence of impolite or negative comments, the probability of the next comment being impolite or negative is 13 {\%} and 25 {\%}, respectively; ANGER however, has a probability of 40 {\%} of being followed by a further ANGER comment. The result could help managers take control the development phases of a system, since social aspects can seriously affect a developer's productivity. In a distributed agile environment this may have a particular resonance.",

Hence, we investigate a sample of 1121 Open Source Software (OSS) projects from GitHub, using longitudinal data analysis. The results from growth curve analysis shows that the team emotional display decrease over time. This negative linear trend decelerates mid-term as suggested by a positive quadratic trend of time. Such deceleration diminishes toward the end as a negative cubic trend suggests.},

abstract = {Pull-request based workflows are popular trends of modern software development platform such as GitHub. A pull-request notifies other developers that new changes are proposed, a code review process follows the pull-request that may be merged in the main branch if other developers accept the changes. Many factors influence the acceptance of pull-requests. Since open source software is based on collaboration, it is essential to discover how the affect expressed by developer discussing pull-request issues, namely how they collaborate, influences the acceptance of the pull-request proposed. In this study we analysed the relations with the affect expressed in pull-request issues' comments and whether an issue is merged in the main branch or not. We focused on pull-request issues and we found that issues with higher level anger, sadness, arousal and valence are less likely to be merged while issues with higher level of valence, joy are more likely to be merged. Positive affect indicates a good collaboration environment, and our finding shows that this healthy collaboration is likely to increase the acceptance of pull-requests.},

abstract = {Background: Studies related to human factors in software engineering are providing insightful information on the emotional state of contributors and the impact this has on the code. The open source software development paradigm involves different roles, and previous studies about emotions in software development have not taken into account what different roles might play when people express their feelings. Aim: We present an analysis of issues and commits on five GitHub projects distinguishing contributors between users and developers, and between one-commit and multi-commit developers. Method: We analyzed more than 650K comments from 130K issues of 64K contributors. We calculated emotions (love, joy, anger, sadness) and politeness of the comments related to the issues of the considered projects and introduced the definition of contributor fan-in and fan-out. Results: Results show that users and developers communicate differently as well as multi-commit developers and one-commit developers do. Conclusions: We provide empirical evidence that one-commit developers are more active and more polite in posting comments. Multi-commit developers are less active in posting comments, and while commenting, they are less polite than when commented.},

We argue that among those emotions anger deserves special attention as it can serve as an onset for tools supporting collaborative software development. This, however, requires a fine-grained model of the anger emotion, able to distinguish between anger directed towards self, others, and objects. Detecting anger towards self could be useful to support developers experiencing difficulties; detection of anger towards others might be helpful for community management; detecting anger towards objects might be helpful to recommend and prioritize improvements. As a first step towards automatic identification of anger direction, we built a classifier for anger direction, based on a manually annotated gold standard of 723 sentences that were obtained by mining comments in Apache issue reports.},

We identified as commenters those users who only post comments without posting any issues nor committing changes in the source code. Since previous studies showed that there is a link between a positive environment (regarding affectiveness) and productivity, our goal was to investigate commenters' contribution to the project concerning affectiveness.We analyzed more than 370K comments from 100K issues of 25K contributors from 3 open source projects. We then calculated and compared the affectiveness of the issues' comments written by users and commenters in terms of sentiment, politeness, and emotions. We provide empirical evidence that commenters are less polite, less positive and in general they express a lower level of emotions in their comments than users. Our results also confirm that GitHub's contributors consist of different groups which behave differently, and this provides useful information for future studies in the field.},

To begin answering this question empirically, we conduct a user study, in which 21 participants are each given 3 information seeking tasks to solve using a text-based chat interface. To complete each task, participants conversed with three conversational agents: an existing commercial system, a human expert, and a perceived experimental automatic system, backed by a human 'wizard' behind the curtain. The observations and insights of our study help us understand the aspirations of users and the limitations of the current conversational agents -- and to sharpen a frontier of work required to improve conversational assistants for search scenarios.},

Where previous work on text segmentation considers the tasks of document segmentation and segment labeling separately, we show that the tasks contain complementary information and are best addressed jointly. We introduce Segment Pooling LSTM (S-LSTM), which is capable of jointly segmenting a document and labeling segments. In support of joint training, we develop a method for teaching the model to recover from errors by aligning the predicted and ground truth segments. We show that S-LSTM reduces segmentation error by 30{\%} on average, while also improving segment labeling.",

In this paper, we propose a model to measure the similarity of a sentence pair focusing on the interaction information. We utilize the word level similarity matrix to discover fine-grained alignment of two sentences. It should be emphasized that each word in a sentence has a different importance from the perspective of semantic composition, so we exploit two novel and efficient strategies to explicitly calculate a weight for each word. Although the proposed model only use a sequential LSTM for sentence modeling without any external resource such as syntactic parser tree and additional lexicon features, experimental results show that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on three datasets of two tasks.",

In the process, developers may have negative interpersonal interactions with their peers, which can lead to frustration and stress; these negative interactions may ultimately result in developers abandoning projects. In this mixed-methods study at one company, we surveyed 1,317 developers to characterize the negative experiences and cross-referenced the results with objective data from code review logs to predict these experiences. Our results suggest that such negative experiences, which we call "pushback", are relatively rare in practice, but have negative repercussions when they occur. Our metrics can predict feelings of pushback with high recall but low precision, making them potentially appropriate for highlighting interactions that may benefit from a self-intervention.},

We argue that among those emotions anger deserves special attention as it can serve as an onset for tools supporting collaborative software development. This, however, requires a fine-grained model of the anger emotion, able to distinguish between anger directed towards self, others, and objects. Detecting anger towards self could be useful to support developers experiencing difficulties; detection of anger towards others might be helpful for community management; detecting anger towards objects might be helpful to recommend and prioritize improvements. As a first step towards automatic identification of anger direction, we built a classifier for anger direction, based on a manually annotated gold standard of 723 sentences that were obtained by mining comments in Apache issue reports.},

Extensive experi-ments are taken on the dataset released by the SemEval-2015 cQA shared task. The first model is a stacked ensemble of the networks. It achieves 58.96{\%} on macro averaged F1, which improves the state-of-the-art neural network-based method by 2.82{\%} and outper-forms the Top-1 system in the shared task by 1.77{\%}. The second is a simple attention-based model whose input is the connection of the question and its corresponding answers. It produces promising results with 58.29{\%} on overall F1 and gains the best performance on the Good and Bad categories.",

In a real-world CQA forum, a question is often represented as two parts: a subject that summarizes the main points of the question, and a body that elaborates on the subject in detail. Previous researches on answer selection usually ignored the difference between these two parts and concatenated them as the question representation. In this paper, we propose the Question Condensing Networks (QCN) to make use of the subject-body relationship of community questions. In our model, the question subject is the primary part of the question representation, and the question body information is aggregated based on similarity and disparity with the question subject. Experimental results show that QCN outperforms all existing models on two CQA datasets.",

With our proposed model, a text is encoded to a vector representation from an word-level to a chunk-level to effectively capture the entire meaning. In particular, by adapting the hierarchical structure, our model shows very small performance degradations in longer text comprehension while other state-of-the-art recurrent neural network models suffer from it. Additionally, the latent topic clustering module extracts semantic information from target samples. This clustering module is useful for any text related tasks by allowing each data sample to find its nearest topic cluster, thus helping the neural network model analyze the entire data. We evaluate our models on the Ubuntu Dialogue Corpus and consumer electronic domain question answering dataset, which is related to Samsung products. The proposed model shows state-of-the-art results for ranking question-answer pairs.",

We first review recent results and methods in automatic learning of dialogue management strategies for spoken and multimodal dialogue systems, and then show how these techniques can also be used for the related problem of Natural Language Generation. This approach promises a number of theoretical and practical benefits such as fine-grained adaptation, generalisation, and automatic (global) optimisation, and we compare it to related work in statistical/trainable NLG. A demonstration of the proposed approach is then developed, showing combined DM and NLG policy learning for adaptive information presentation decisions. A joint DM and NLG policy learned in the framework shows a statistically significant 27\% relative increase in reward over a baseline policy, which is learned in the same way only without the joint optimisation. We thereby show that that NLG problems can be approached statistically, in combination with dialogue management decisions, and we show how to jointly optimise NLG and DM using Reinforcement Learning."

abstract = "Monthly, 50 million users visit Stack Overflow, a popular Q\&A forum used by software developers, to share and gather knowledge and help with coding problems. Although Q\&A forums serve as a good resource for seeking help from developers beyond the local team, the abundance of information can cause developers, especially novice software engineers, to spend considerable time in identifying relevant answers and suitable suggested fixes. This exploratory study aims to understand how novice software engineers direct their efforts and what kinds of information they focus on within a post selected from the results returned in response to a search query on Stack Overflow. The results can be leveraged to improve the Q\&A forum interface, guide tools for mining forums, and potentially improve granularity of traceability mappings involving forum posts. We qualitatively analyze the novice software engineers'�� perceptions from a survey as well as their annotations of a set of Stack Overflow posts. Our results indicate that novice software engineers pay attention to only 27\% of code and 15-21\% of text in a Stack Overflow post to understand and determine how to apply the relevant information to their context. Our results also discern the kinds of information prominent in that focus."

    abstract = { Question answering (Q\&A) sites, where communities of volunteers answer questions, may provide faster, cheaper, and better services than traditional institutions. However, like other Web 2.0 platforms, user-created content raises concerns about information quality. At the same time, Q\&A sites may provide answers of different quality because they have different communities and technological platforms. This paper compares answer quality on four Q\&A sites: Askville, WikiAnswers, Wikipedia Reference Desk, and Yahoo! Answers. Findings indicate that: (1) similar collaborative processes on these sites result in a wide range of outcomes, and significant differences in answer accuracy, completeness, and verifiability were evident; (2) answer multiplication does not always result in better information; it yields more complete and verifiable answers but does not result in higher accuracy levels; and (3) a Q\&A site’s popularity does not correlate with its answer quality, on all three measures. }

abstract = { Software Engineering (SE) communities such as Stack Overflow have become unwelcoming,
particularly through members’ use of offensive language. Research has shown that offensive
language drives users away from active engagement within these platforms. This work
aims to explore this issue more broadly by investigating the nature of offensive language
in comments posted by users in four prominent SE platforms – GitHub, Gitter, Slack
and Stack Overflow (SO). It proposes an approach to detect and classify offensive
language in SE communities by adopting natural language processing and deep learning
techniques. Further, a Conflict Reduction System (CRS), which identifies offence and
then suggests what changes could be made to minimize offence has been proposed. Beyond
showing the prevalence of offensive language in over 1 million comments from four
different communities which ranges from 0.07% to 0.43%, our results show promise in
successful detection and classification of such language. The CRS system has the potential
to drastically reduce manual moderation efforts to detect and reduce offence in SE
communities.},

The procedure essentially involves the construction of functions of the observed proportions which are directed at the extent to which the observers agree among themselves and the construction of test statistics for hypotheses involving these functions. Tests for interobserver bias are presented in terms of first order marginal homogeneity and measures of interobserver agreement are developed as generalized kappa type statistics. These procedures are illustrated with a clinical diagnosis example from the epidemiological literature.",

The current project investigated the features of linguistic style that distinguish between true and false stories. In an analysis of five independent samples, a computer-based text analysis program correctly classified liars and truth-tellers at a rate of 67\% when the topic was constant and a rate of 61\% overall. Compared to truth-tellers, liars showed lower cognitive complexity, used fewer self-references and other-references, and used more negative emotion words. }

Almost invisible to the reader or writer, function words can reveal ways people think and approach topics. A computerized text analysis of over 50,000 college admissions essays from more than 25,000 entering students found a coherent dimension of language use based on eight standard function word categories. The dimension, which reflected the degree students used categorical versus dynamic language, was analyzed to track college grades over students’ four years of college. Higher grades were associated with greater article and preposition use, indicating categorical language (i.e., references to complexly organized objects and concepts). Lower grades were associated with greater use of auxiliary verbs, pronouns, adverbs, conjunctions, and negations, indicating more dynamic language (i.e., personal narratives). The links between the categorical-dynamic index (CDI) and academic performance hint at the cognitive styles rewarded by higher education institutions.}, number={12}, journal={PLOS ONE}, publisher={Public Library of Science}, author={Pennebaker, James W. and Chung, Cindy K. and Frazee, Joey and Lavergne, Gary M. and Beaver, David I.}, year={2015}, month={Dec}, pages={1–10} }

abstract = {User forums of Open Source Software (OSS) enable end-users to collaboratively discuss problems concerning the OSS applications. Despite decades of research on OSS, we know very little about how end-users engage with OSS communities on these forums, in particular, the challenges that hinder their continuous and meaningful participation in the OSS community. Many previous works are developer-centric and overlook the importance of end-user forums. As a result, end-users' expectations are seldom reflected in OSS development. To better understand user behaviors in OSS user forums, we carried out an empirical study analyzing about 1.3 million posts from user forums of four popular OSS applications: Zotero, Audacity, VLC, and RStudio. Through analyzing the contribution patterns of three common user types (end-users, developers, and organizers), we observed that end-users not only initiated most of the threads (above 96\% of threads in three projects, 86\% in the other), but also acted as the significant contributors for responding to other users' posts, even though they tended to lack confidence in their activities as indicated by psycho-linguistic analyses. Moreover, we found end-users more open, reflecting a more positive emotion in communication than organizers and developers in the forums. Our work contributes new knowledge about end-users' activities and behaviors in OSS user forums that the vital OSS stakeholders can leverage to improve end-user engagement in the OSS development process.},

abstract="Effective communication is an important issue for global software development. Due to geographical limitations and travel challenges, face-to-face meetings are expensive to schedule and run. Web-based communication methods are thus the primary means of communication in global software development efforts. In general, two types of web-based communication mechanisms exist: synchronous and asynchronous communications; each serves a unique role. In this paper, we present an empirical study of the communication mechanisms in GNOME GTK+, a small-sized open-source distributed software project, in which Internet Relay Chat (IRC) and Mailing Lists are used as synchronous and asynchronous communication methods, respectively. The objective of this study is to identify how real time and asynchronous communication methods could be used and balanced across global software development projects.",

abstract="Stack Overflow is a popular on-line question and answer site for software developers to share their experience and expertise. Among the numerous questions posted in Stack Overflow, two or more of them may express the same point and thus are duplicates of one another. Duplicate questions make Stack Overflow site maintenance harder, waste resources that could have been used to answer other questions, and cause developers to unnecessarily wait for answers that are already available. To reduce the problem of duplicate questions, Stack Overflow allows questions to be manually marked as duplicates of others. Since there are thousands of questions submitted to Stack Overflow every day, manually identifying duplicate questions is a difficult work. Thus, there is a need for an automated approach that can help in detecting these duplicate questions. To address the above-mentioned need, in this paper, we propose an automated approach named DupPredictor that takes a new question as input and detects potential duplicates of this question by considering multiple factors. DupPredictor extracts the title and description of a question and also tags that are attached to the question. These pieces of information (title, description, and a few tags) are mandatory information that a user needs to input when posting a question. DupPredictor then computes the latent topics of each question by using a topic model. Next, for each pair of questions, it computes four similarity scores by comparing their titles, descriptions, latent topics, and tags. These four similarity scores are finally combined together to result in a new similarity score that comprehensively considers the multiple factors. To examine the benefit of DupPredictor, we perform an experiment on a Stack Overflow dataset which contains a total of more than two million questions. The result shows that DupPredictor can achieve a recall-rate@20 score of 63.8{\%}. We compare our approach with the standard search engine of Stack Overflow, and DupPredictor improves its recall-rate@10 score by 40.63{\%}. We also compare our approach with approaches that only use title, description, topic, and tag similarity and Runeson et al.'s approach that has been used to detect duplicate bug reports, and DupPredictor improves their recall-rate@10 scores by 27.2{\%}, 97.4{\%}, 746.0{\%}, 231.1{\%}, and 16.4{\%} respectively.",
