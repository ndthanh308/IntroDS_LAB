\section{Conclusion}
\label{section-3}
In this work, we provided an extension of DyGLib to TGB and offered an empirical evaluation of TGB. By conducting experiments, we pointed out some issues in the current version of TGB and presented comprehensive results of several existing dynamic graph learning methods. Our goal is to reduce the efforts of researchers in evaluating different dynamic graph learning methods and facilitates the development of new approaches. This work is ongoing and we welcome feedback from the community to improve it further.
