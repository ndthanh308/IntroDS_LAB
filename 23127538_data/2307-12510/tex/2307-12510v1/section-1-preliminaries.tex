\textbf{Background}. Dynamic graph learning has attracted the increasing attention of many scholars \cite{DBLP:journals/jmlr/KazemiGJKSFP20}. To foster the development of dynamic graph learning, Dynamic Graph Library (DyGLib) \cite{yu2023towards} and Temporal Graph Benchmark (TGB) \cite{huang2023temporal} were introduced very recently. Concretely, DyGLib is a dynamic graph learning library that integrates several popular dynamic graph learning methods in a standard training pipeline. TGB presents a collection of challenging and diverse benchmark datasets for temporal graphs\footnote{In this paper, "dynamic" and "temporal" are used interchangeably.}.

\textbf{Our work}. This work extends DyGLib to TGB to provide more comprehensive and reliable experimental results for the follow-up research. We evaluate eleven methods on dynamic link property prediction and dynamic node property prediction tasks in TGB through a well-coded implementation. We also point out some existing issues in the current version of TGB and discuss key observations in the experiments.
