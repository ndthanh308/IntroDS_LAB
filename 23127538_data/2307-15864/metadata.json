  "abstract": "The necessity of radix conversion of numeric data is an indispensable component in any complete analysis of digital computation. In this paper, we propose a binary encoding for mixed-radix digits. Second, a variant of rANS coding based on this conversion is given, which supports parallel decoding. The simulations show that the proposed coding in serial mode has a higher throughput than the baseline (with the speed-up factor about 2X) without loss of compression ratio, and it outperforms the existing 2-way interleaving implementation.",
