abstract = {Real-time games such as first-person shooters (FPS) are sensitive to even small amounts of lag. The effects of net-work latency have been studied, but less is known about local latency, the lag caused by input devices and displays. While local latency is important to gamers, we do not know how it affects aiming performance and whether we can reduce its negative effects. To explore these issues, we tested local latency in a variety of real-world gaming scenarios and carried out a controlled study focusing on targeting and tracking activities in an FPS game with varying degrees of local latency. In addition, we tested the ability of a lag compensation technique (based on aim assistance) to mitigate the negative effects. Our study found local latencies in the real-world range from 23 to 243 ms which cause significant and substantial degradation in performance (even for latencies as low as 41 ms). The study also showed that our compensation technique worked extremely well, reducing the problems caused by lag in the case of targeting, and removing the problem altogether in the case of tracking. Our work shows that local latency is a real and substantial problem -- but games can mitigate the problem with appropriate compensation methods.},

abstract = {Studies have shown that local latency -- delays between an input action and the resulting change to the display -- can negatively affect gameplay. However, these studies report several different thresholds (from 50 to 500ms) where local latency causes problems, and there is still little understanding of the relationship between the temporal requirements of a game and the effects of local latency. To help designers determine how lag will affect their games, we designed two studies that focus on specific atoms of interaction in simple games, and characterize both gameplay performance and experience under increasing local latency. We use the data from the first study to develop a simple predictive model of performance based on the amount of lag and the speed of the game. We used the model to predict performance in the second study, and our predictions were accurate, particularly for faster games and higher levels of lag. Our work provides a new analysis of how local latency affects games, which explains why some game atoms will be sensitive to latency, and which can allow predictive modeling of when playability will suffer due to lag, even without extensive playtesting.},

ABSTRACT = {Recently, deep neural networks have shown surprising results in solving most of the traditional image processing problems. However, the video frame interpolation field does not show relatively good performance because the receptive field requires a vast spatio-temporal range. To reduce the computational complexity, in most frame interpolation studies, motion is first calculated with the optical flow, then interpolated frames are generated through backward warping. However, while the backward warping process is simple to implement, the interpolated image contains mixed motion and ghosting defects. Therefore, we propose a new network that does not use the backward warping method through the proposed max-min warping. Since max-min warping generates a clear warping image in advance according to the size of the motion and the network is configured to select the warping result according to the warped layer, using the proposed method, it is possible to optimize the computational complexity while selecting a contextually appropriate image. The video interpolation method using the proposed method showed 34.847 PSNR in the Vimeo90k dataset and 0.13 PSNR improvement compared to the Quadratic Video Interpolation method, showing that it is an efficient frame interpolation self-supervised learning.},

abstract = {The growth in network capacities and availability has been accompanied by a proliferation of online games. While online games perform well under many network conditions, Internet delays can often degrade online game performance. The precise impact that latency has on online gameplay depends upon the game type and the actions within the game. While the effects of latency on specific games has been studied, knowledge about the effects of latency on classes of games and about the effects of latency on different player actions is lacking. This paper presents a broad, perspective-based classification of games based on player control and camera view. The foundation of the game classification are player actions, each of which is defined by its precision and deadline requirements. Experiments with controlled amount of precision, deadline and latency support the classification. This classification of games should prove useful for game designers, network engineers and game players themselves as they build and play on tomorrow's networks.},

abstract = {Software designed for direct-touch interfaces often utilize a metaphor of direct physical manipulation of pseudo "real-world" objects. However, current touch systems typically take 50-200ms to update the display in response to a physi-cal touch action. Utilizing a high performance touch de-monstrator, subjects were able to experience touch latencies ranging from current levels down to about 1ms. Our tests show that users greatly prefer lower latencies, and noticea-ble improvement continued well below 10ms. This level of performance is difficult to achieve in commercial compu-ting systems using current technologies. As an alternative, we propose a hybrid system that provides low-fidelity visu-al feedback immediately, followed by high-fidelity visuals at standard levels of latency.},
