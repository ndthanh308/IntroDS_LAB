\begin{abstract}
High-frequency displays are gaining immense popularity because of their increasing use in video games and virtual
reality applications.  However, the issue is that the underlying GPUs cannot continuously generate frames at this high
rate -- this results in a less smooth and responsive experience. Furthermore, if the frame rate is not synchronized with the refresh
rate, the user may experience screen tearing and stuttering. Previous works propose increasing the frame rate to provide
a smooth experience on modern displays by predicting new frames based on past or future frames. Interpolation and
extrapolation are two widely used algorithms that predict new frames.  Interpolation requires waiting for the future
frame to make a prediction, which adds additional latency.  On the other hand, extrapolation provides a better quality
of experience because it relies solely on past frames --  it does not incur any additional latency. The simplest method
to extrapolate a frame is to warp the previous frame using motion vectors; however, the warped frame may contain
improperly rendered visual
artifacts due to dynamic objects -- this makes it very challenging to design such a scheme. Past work has used DNNs
to get good accuracy, however, these approaches are slow.
This paper proposes \exwarp -- an approach based on
reinforcement learning (RL) to intelligently choose between the slower DNN-based extrapolation and faster warping-based
methods to increase the frame rate
by 4$\times$ with an almost negligible reduction in the perceived image quality.
