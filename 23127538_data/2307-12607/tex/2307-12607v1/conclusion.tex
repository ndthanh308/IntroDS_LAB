\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:Conclusion}
With high-frequency displays becoming increasingly popular, it is now necessary to generate
frames for real-time applications at higher rates. Since applications are very demanding in terms of processing power,
it is not possible for even the most capable GPUs to constantly provide a high frame rate at an HD/4k resolution.
It has become evident that new frames need to be generated without having to go through the entire graphics pipeline.
This work illustrates one such method, \exwarp, of supersampling in the temporal domain, while maintaining frame quality.  The
existing methods use extrapolation to increase the frame rate but we observed that it is not always necessary to use an
expensive method like extrapolation and that the decision to extrapolate or use a faster method such as warping can be
intelligently made. We designed such a predictor to take this decision.
We were able to achieve nearly four times the frame rate ($\approx 120$ Hz) with a reasonably small reduction in the
quality.
