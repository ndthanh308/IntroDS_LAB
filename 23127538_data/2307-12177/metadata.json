  "abstract": "In a trapped spin-1/2 Bose-Einstein condensate with miscible interactions, a two-dimensional spin-orbit coupling can introduce an unconventional spatial separation between the two components. We reveal the physical mechanism of such a spin-orbit-coupling-induced phase separation. Detailed features of the phase separation are identified in a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate. We further analyze differences of phase separation in Rashba and anisotropic spin-orbit-coupled Bose gases. An adiabatic splitting dynamics is proposed as an application of the phase separation.",
