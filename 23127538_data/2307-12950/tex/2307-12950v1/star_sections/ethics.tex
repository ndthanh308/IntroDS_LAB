Strong general-purpose methods for improving and controlling language models pose a risk of dual use. In this work, we focus on the harmlessness and helpfulness tasks from \citet{bai2022training,bai2022constitutional}; advancements on the harmlessness task especially have significant potential to mitigate risks associated with deploying strong language models. Our story outline task, based on creative writing, is also relatively innocuous. 

Additionally, as discussed in Limitations, our experiments in this work are solely in English, and performance could be worse in lower-resource languages.
