  "abstract": "Let $S_g$ denote a closed oriented surface of genus $g \\geq 2$. A set $Ω= \\{ c_1, \\dots, c_d\\}$ of pairwise non-homotopic simple closed curves on $S_g$ is called a filling system or simply a filling of $S_g$, if $S_g\\setminus Ω$ is a union of $\\ell$ topological discs for some $\\ell\\geq 1$. For $1\\leq i\\leq d$, let $T_{c_i}$ denotes the Dehn twist along $c_i$. In this article, we show that for each $d\\geq 2$, there exists a filling $Ω=\\{c_1,c_2,\\dots, c_d\\}$ of $S_g$ such that the group $\\langle T_{c_1}, T_{c_2},\\dots,T_{c_d}\\rangle$ is isomorphic to the free group of rank $d$.",
