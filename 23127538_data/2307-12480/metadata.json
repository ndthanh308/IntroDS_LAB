  "abstract": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) update the hidden representations of vertices (called Vertex-GNNs) or hidden representations of edges (called Edge-GNNs) by processing and pooling the information of neighboring vertices and edges and combining to exploit topology information. When learning resource allocation policies, GNNs cannot perform well if their expressive power is weak, i.e., if they cannot differentiate all input features such as channel matrices. In this paper, we analyze the expressive power of the Vertex-GNNs and Edge-GNNs for learning three representative wireless policies: link scheduling, power control, and precoding policies. We find that the expressive power of the GNNs depends on the linearity and output dimensions of the processing and combination functions. When linear processors are used, the Vertex-GNNs cannot differentiate all channel matrices due to the loss of channel information, while the Edge-GNNs can. When learning the precoding policy, even the Vertex-GNNs with non-linear processors may not be with strong expressive ability due to the dimension compression. We proceed to provide necessary conditions for the GNNs to well learn the precoding policy. Simulation results validate the analyses and show that the Edge-GNNs can achieve the same performance as the Vertex-GNNs with much lower training and inference time.",
