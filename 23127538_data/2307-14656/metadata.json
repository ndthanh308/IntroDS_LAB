  "abstract": "We consider a square expanding with constant speed seen from an observer moving away with constant acceleration and study the distribution of angles between rays from the observer towards the lattice points in the square. We prove the existence of the gap distribution as time tends to infinity and provide explicit formulas for the corresponding density function.",
