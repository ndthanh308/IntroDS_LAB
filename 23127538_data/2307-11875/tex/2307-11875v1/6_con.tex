\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:conclusion}


We propose MORE, a QNN-based multi-classifier that maximizes quantum resource efficiency. By fully leveraging quantum information, MORE employs a simple ansatz as the binary classifier with only one readout qubit to solve multi-classification problems. To achieve this, MORE first converts classical labels into corresponding quantum labels using variational quantum clustering. This process considers interclass correlations, allowing the learned quantum labels to capture intrinsic patterns in the classical feature space of the training data. Quantum supervised learning is then performed based on the quantum labels to efficiently train the model. Furthermore, we introduce a loss adjuster to enhance the model's quality by making it more sensitive to the labels that can result in misclassifications during training. Our comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that MORE outperforms general quantum multi-classifiers and is capable of effective operation in noisy quantum systems due to its reduced error sources. This suggests that fully utilizing quantum information offers a promising approach for scaling up the problem sizes that can be addressed during the current NISQ era.
