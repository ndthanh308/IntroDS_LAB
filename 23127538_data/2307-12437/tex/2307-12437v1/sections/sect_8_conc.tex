\section{Conclusions}

In this paper, we proposed and experimentally validated zonotope-based robust explicit MPC, as well as additional algorithms: convex order reduction method and time-free policy choice. It was experimentally shown that the methods work on hybrid systems, non-linear systems linearized along a trajectory, systems with parametric uncertainty in friction, mass, inertia, and stiffness.

The proposed method can be used to account for a variety of sources of parametric uncertainty, including linearization errors. The method is conservative by design; we observed that even when the system exits state-space areas covered by zonotopes (which happens due to poor sensory feedback, large unmodelled disturbances, linearization errors, or unmodelled dynamics), it still tends to return to one of the zonotopes. A further study of this property might be of interest.
