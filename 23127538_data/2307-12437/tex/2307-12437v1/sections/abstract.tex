Explicit model-predictive control (MPC) is a widely used control design method that employs optimization tools to find control policies offline; commonly it is posed as a semi-definite program (SDP) or as a mixed-integer SDP in the case of hybrid systems. However, mixed-integer SDPs are computationally expensive, motivating alternative formulations, such as zonotope-based MPC (zonotopes are a special type of symmetric polytopes). In this paper, we propose a robust explicit MPC method applicable to hybrid systems. More precisely, we extend existing zonotope-based MPC methods to account for multiplicative parametric uncertainty. Additionally, we propose a convex zonotope order reduction method that takes advantage of the iterative structure of the zonotope propagation problem to promote diagonal blocks in the zonotope generators and lower the number of decision variables. Finally, we developed a quasi-time-free policy choice algorithm, allowing the system to start from any point on the trajectory and avoid chattering associated with discrete switching of linear control policies based on the current state's membership in state-space regions. Last but not least, we verify the validity of the proposed methods on two experimental setups, varying physical parameters between experiments.

% This paper proposes robust explicit model-predictive control (MPC) method, able to handle parameter uncertainties, and applicable, but not limited, to hybrid systems. In this paper we extend existing zonotope-based MPC methods to account for parameter uncertainty. We also propose supporting algorithms, such as a convex zonotope order reduction method and a time-free policy choice algorithm. We verify validity of the proposed methods on two experimental setups, varying physical parameters between experiments, showing good performance of the method.

% Explicit MPC allows to use optimization tools to find control policies offline, which can be done, for example, with the use of linear matrix inequalities (LMI) to guarantee finite time stability (FTS) of the system, which leads to semi-definite programs (SDP), or mixed-integer SDP in case of hybrid systems. Use of zonotope-based MPC (zonotopes are a special type of symmetric polytopes) allows to avoid computationally challenging SDP. In this paper we extend existing zonotope-based MPC methods to account for parameter uncertainty. We also propose supporting algorithms, such as a convex zonotope order reduction method and a time-free policy choice algorithm. We verify validity of the proposed methods on two experimental setups, varying physical parameters between experiments, showing good performance of the method.
