  "abstract": "Let $F$ be a local non-Archimedean field and $E$ a finite Galois extension of $F$, with Galois group $G$. If $ρ$ is a representation of $G$ on a complex vector space $V$, we may compose it with any tensor operation $R$ on $V$, and get another representation $R\\circρ$. We study the relation between the Swan exponents $\\mathrm{Sw}(ρ)$ and $\\mathrm{Sw}(R\\circρ)$, with a particular attention to the cases where $R$ is symmetric square or exterior square. Indeed those cases intervene in the local Langlands correspondence for split classical groups over $F$, via the formal degree conjecture, and we present some applications of our work to the explicit description of the Langlands parameter of simple cuspidal representations. For irreducible $ρ$ our main results determine $\\mathrm{Sw}(\\mathrm{Sym}^{2}ρ)$ and $\\mathrm{Sw}(\\wedge^{2}ρ)$ from $\\mathrm{Sw}(ρ)$ when the residue characteristic $p$ of $F$ is odd, and bound them in terms of $\\mathrm{Sw}(ρ)$ when $p$ is $2$. In that case where $p$ is $2$ we conjecture stronger bounds, for which we provide evidence.",
