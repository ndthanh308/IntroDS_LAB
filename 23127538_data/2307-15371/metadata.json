  "abstract": "Considering a three-dimensional $C$-metric and adding energy-dependent to this spacetime, we first create a three-dimensional energy-dependent $C$-metric. Then, we extract accelerating BTZ black hole solutions in gravity's rainbow. Besides, we show that (A)dS black holes cover by an event horizon that depends on all the parameters of this theory. Using the definition of Hawking temperature, we obtain the temperature of these black holes and study the effects of various parameters on this quantity. We find a critical radius in which the temperature is always positive (negative) before (after) it. Then, we obtain the entropy of such black holes. Our analysis indicates that there is the same behavior for entropy, similar to the temperature. Indeed, before (after) the critical radius, the entropy is positive (negative). In order to study the local stability of such black holes, we calculate the heat capacity. We find two different behaviors for the heat capacity, which depend on the cosmological energy-dependent constant. As a final result, accelerating AdS BTZ black holes can satisfy the physical condition and local stability at the same time.",
