% Abstract of the paper
\begin{abstract}
Together with larger spectroscopic surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the precision of large scale structure studies and thus the constraints on the cosmological parameters are rapidly improving. Therefore, one must build realistic simulations and robust covariance matrices. 

We build galaxy catalogues by applying a Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model upon the \textsc{FastPM} simulations, such that the resulting galaxy clustering reproduces high resolution $N$-body simulations. While the resolution and halo finder are different from the reference simulations, we reproduce the reference galaxy two-point clustering measurements -- monopole and quadrupole -- to a precision required by the DESI Year 1 Emission Line Galaxy sample down to non-linear scales, i.e. $k<0.5\,\ku$ or $s>10\,\su$.

Furthermore, we compute covariance matrices based on the resulting \textsc{FastPM} galaxy clustering -- monopole and quadrupole. We study for the first time the effect of fitting on Fourier conjugate [e.g. power spectrum] on the covariance matrix of the Fourier counterpart [e.g. correlation function]. We estimate the uncertainties of the two parameters of a simple clustering model and observe a maximum variation of 20 per cent for the different covariance matrices. Nevertheless, for most studied scales the scatter is between two to ten per cent

Consequently, using the current pipeline we can precisely reproduce the clustering of $N$-body simulations and the resulting covariance matrices provide robust uncertainty estimations against HOD fitting scenarios. We expect our methodology will be useful for the coming DESI data analyses and their extension for other studies.

%Together with larger spectroscopic surveys such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), the precision of large scale structure studies and thus the constraints on the cosmological parameters are rapidly improving.
%The pursuit of under However, this comes with the important challenges of better understanding the systematic effects in the data and of estimating precisely and accurately the uncertainty due to cosmic variance. In order to achieve this, one must build realistic simulations of the large scale structures. As part of the DESI Mock Challenge, we develop a pipeline to assign galaxies on \textsc{FastPM} halo mocks using a Halo Occupation Distribution (HOD) model, such that the resulting galaxy clustering reproduces the high-resolution $N$-body simulations.
%While the resolution and halo finder are different from the reference simulations, our pipeline reproduces the reference galaxy two-point clustering measurements -- monopole and quadrupole -- within 1 to $2 \sigma$ above a certain scale, i.e. $k<0.5\,h/\mathrm{Mpc}$ or $s>10\,\mathrm{Mpc} / h$. Even though the power spectrum hexadecapole is not included in the HOD fitting, it can be reproduced for $k<0.4\,h/\mathrm{Mpc}$ within $\approx 2\sigma$ accuracy. In contrast, the two-point correlation function hexadecapole matches the reference only at the linear scales $s>60\,\mathrm{Mpc} / h$. Including the scales down to $k=0.5\,h/\mathrm{Mpc}$, the bi-spectrum can be reproduced within $2\sigma $ deviation from the reference.
%Finally, we compute six covariance matrices based on the resulting \textsc{FastPM} galaxy clustering -- monopole and quadrupole -- and compare the resulting uncertainties of the two parameters of a simple clustering model. The uncertainty estimation can vary by maximum 20 per cent for the different covariance matrices, however for most studied scales the scatter is between two to ten per cent. Consequently, using the current pipeline we can precisely reproduce the clustering of $N$-body simulations and the resulting covariance matrices provide robust uncertainty estimations against HOD fitting scenarios. 
%We expect our pipeline will be useful for the coming DESI data analyses and their extension for other studies.
