  "abstract": "In this paper, we study a generalization of the notion of AS-regularity for connected $\\mathbb{Z}$-algebras. Our main result is a characterization of those categories equivalent to noncommutative projective schemes associated to right coherent regular $\\mathbb{Z}$-algebras, which we call quantum projective $\\mathbb{Z}$-spaces in this paper. As an application, we show that smooth quadric hypersurfaces and the standard noncommutative smooth quadric surfaces have right noetherian AS-regular $\\mathbb{Z}$-algebras as homogeneous coordinate algebras. In particular, the latter are thus noncommutative $\\mathbb{P}^1\\times \\mathbb{P}^1$.",
