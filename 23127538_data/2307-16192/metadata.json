  "abstract": "Public libraries play a crucial role in disseminating knowledge to society. However, most of their users do not have the specialized knowledge to understand the new research findings. Providing plain language summaries (PLSs) in public libraries is a way to make the new research findings more accessible and understandable for the public. This article proposes a framework for providing PLSs as a new service in public libraries. Drawing from the literature on science and society, PLSs, and public libraries, a theoretical framework is developed. The findings suggest that public libraries can collect PLSs through different methods, such as professional teams, researchers, crowdsourcing, etc. Library newsletters, special publications, brochures, independent online databases, and social networks are among the most effective for making PLSs accessible to users. By proposing a framework for providing PLSs in public libraries, this study helps to bridge the gap between scientific research and the public.",
