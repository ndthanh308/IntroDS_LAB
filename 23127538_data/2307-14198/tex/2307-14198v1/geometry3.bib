@article{Artime2021,
	Abstract = {Percolation is an emblematic model to assess the robustness of interconnected systems when some of their components are corrupted. It is usually investigated in simple scenarios, such as the removal of the system's units in random order, or sequentially ordered by specific topological descriptors. However, in the vast majority of empirical applications, it is required to dismantle the network following more sophisticated protocols, for instance, by combining topological properties and non-topological node metadata. We propose a novel mathematical framework to fill this gap: networks are enriched with features and their nodes are removed according to the importance in the feature space. We consider features of different nature, from ones related to the network construction to ones related to dynamical processes such as epidemic spreading. Our framework not only provides a natural generalization of percolation but, more importantly, offers an accurate way to test the robustness of networks in realistic scenarios.},

@article{Smith2017,
	Abstract = {Real-world networks are often organized as modules or communities of similar nodes that serve as functional units. These networks are also rich in content, with nodes having distinguished features or attributes. In order to discover a network's modular structure, it is necessary to take into account not only its links but also node attributes. We describe an information-theoretic method that identifies modules by compressing descriptions of information flow on a network. Our formulation introduces node content into the description of information flow, which we then minimize to discover groups of nodes with similar attributes that also tend to trap the flow of information. The method is conceptually simple and does not require ad-hoc parameters to specify the number of modules or to control the relative contribution of links and node attributes to network structure. We apply the proposed method to partition real-world networks with known community structure. We demonstrate that adding node attributes helps recover the underlying community structure in content-rich networks more effectively than using links alone. In addition, we show that our method is faster and more accurate than alternative state-of-the-art algorithms.},

@article{Newman2016,
	Abstract = {For many networks of scientific interest we know both the connections of the network and information about the network nodes, such as the age or gender of individuals in a social network. Here we demonstrate how this `metadata' can be used to improve our understanding of network structure. We focus in particular on the problem of community detection in networks and develop a mathematically principled approach that combines a network and its metadata to detect communities more accurately than can be done with either alone. Crucially, the method does not assume that the metadata are correlated with the communities we are trying to find. Instead, the method learns whether a correlation exists and correctly uses or ignores the metadata depending on whether they contain useful information. We demonstrate our method on synthetic networks with known structure and on real-world networks, large and small, drawn from social, biological and technological domains.},

@article{CENCETTI2020109707,
	Abstract = {A class of systems is considered, where immobile species associated to distinct patches, the nodes of a network, interact both locally and at a long-range, as specified by an (interaction) adjacency matrix. Non local interactions are treated in a mean-field setting which enables the system to reach a homogeneous consensus state, either constant or time dependent. We provide analytical evidence that such homogeneous solution can turn unstable under externally imposed disturbances, following a symmetry breaking mechanism which anticipates the subsequent outbreak of the patterns. The onset of the instability can be traced back, via a linear stability analysis, to a dispersion relation that is shaped by the spectrum of an unconventional reactive Laplacian. The proposed mechanism prescinds from the classical Local Activation and Lateral Inhibition scheme, which sits at the core of the Turing recipe for diffusion driven instabilities. Examples of systems displaying a fixed-point or a limit cycle, in their uncoupled versions, are discussed. Taken together, our results pave the way for alternative mechanisms of pattern formation, opening new possibilities for modeling ecological, chemical and physical interacting systems.},

@article{Fahimipour:2022aa,
	Abstract = {Consider a cooperation game on a spatial network of habitat patches, where players can relocate between patches if they judge the local conditions to be unfavorable. In time, the relocation events may lead to a homogeneous state where all patches harbor the same relative densities of cooperators and defectors, or they may lead to self-organized patterns, where some patches become safe havens that maintain an elevated cooperator density. Here we analyze the transition between these states mathematically. We show that safe havens form once a certain threshold in connectivity is crossed. This threshold can be analytically linked to the structure of the patch network and specifically to certain network motifs. Surprisingly, a forgiving defector avoidance strategy may be most favorable for cooperators. Our results demonstrate that the analysis of cooperation games in ecological metacommunity models is mathematically tractable and has the potential to link topics such as macroecological patterns, behavioral evolution, and network topology.},

	Abstract = {We revisit a seminal paper by Levin (Am Nat 108:207--228, 1974), where spatially mediated coexistence and spatial pattern formation were described. We do so by reviewing and explaining the mathematical tools used to evaluate the dynamics of ecological systems in space, from the perspective of recent developments in spatial population dynamics. We stress the importance of space-mediated stability for the coexistence of competing species and explore the ecological consequences of space-induced instabilities (Turing instabilities) for spatial pattern formation in predator--prey systems. Throughout, we link existing theory to recent developments in discrete spatially structured metapopulations, such as our understanding of how ecological dynamics occurring on a network can be analyzed using the Laplacian matrix and its associated eigenvalue spectrum. We underline the validity of Levin's message, over 40 years later, and suggest it has ever-growing implications in a changing and increasingly fragmented world.},

@article{GarciaPerez2019,
	Abstract = {We introduce Mercator, a reliable embedding method to map real complex networks into their hyperbolic latent geometry. The method assumes that the structure of networks is well described by the popularity × similarity static geometric network model, which can accommodate arbitrary degree distributions and reproduces many pivotal properties of real networks, including self-similarity patterns. The algorithm mixes machine learning and maximum likelihood (ML) approaches to infer the coordinates of the nodes in the underlying hyperbolic disk with the best matching between the observed network topology and the geometric model. In its fast mode, Mercator uses a model-adjusted machine learning technique performing dimensional reduction to produce a fast and accurate map, whose quality already outperforms other embedding algorithms in the literature. In the refined Mercator mode, the fast mode embedding result is taken as an initial condition in a ML estimation, which significantly improves the quality of the final embedding. Apart from its accuracy as an embedding tool, Mercator has the clear advantage of systematically inferring not only node orderings, or angular positions, but also the hidden degrees and global model parameters, and has the ability to embed networks with arbitrary degree distributions. Overall, our results suggest that mixing machine learning and ML techniques in a model-dependent framework can boost the meaningful mapping of complex networks.},

	Abstract = {Spatial heterogeneity (patchiness) in certain predator-prey situations has been observed even though their environment appears homogeneous. As a model mechanism to explain this patchiness phenomenon we propose a predator-prey interaction system with diffusive effects. We show that when the diffusion of the prey is small compared with that of the predator the non-linearity which we call a hump effect in the prey interaction, is a key mechanism for the system to exhibit, asymptotically in time, stable heterogeneity in a bounded domain with zero flux boundary conditions. The model can reasonably be applied to certain terrestrial plant-herbivore systems.},

	Abstract = { Branching processes underpin the complex evolution of many real systems. However, network models typically describe network growth in terms of a sequential addition of nodes. Here, we measured the evolution of real networks---journal citations and international trade---over a 100-y period and found that they grow in a self-similar way that preserves their structural features over time. This observation can be explained by a geometric branching growth model that generates a multiscale unfolding of the network by using a combination of branching growth and a hidden metric space approach. Our model enables multiple practical applications, including the detection of optimal network size for maximal response to an external influence and a finite-size scaling analysis of critical behavior. Real networks often grow through the sequential addition of new nodes that connect to older ones in the graph. However, many real systems evolve through the branching of fundamental units, whether those be scientific fields, countries, or species. Here, we provide empirical evidence for self-similar growth of network structure in the evolution of real systems---the journal-citation network and the world trade web---and present the geometric branching growth model, which predicts this evolution and explains the symmetries observed. The model produces multiscale unfolding of a network in a sequence of scaled-up replicas preserving network features, including clustering and community structure, at all scales. Practical applications in real instances include the tuning of network size for best response to external influence and finite-size scaling to assess critical behavior under random link failures. },

	Abstract = {We introduce Mercator, a reliable embedding method to map real complex networks into their hyperbolic latent geometry. The method assumes that the structure of networks is well described by the popularity × similarity static geometric network model, which can accommodate arbitrary degree distributions and reproduces many pivotal properties of real networks, including self-similarity patterns. The algorithm mixes machine learning and maximum likelihood (ML) approaches to infer the coordinates of the nodes in the underlying hyperbolic disk with the best matching between the observed network topology and the geometric model. In its fast mode, Mercator uses a model-adjusted machine learning technique performing dimensional reduction to produce a fast and accurate map, whose quality already outperforms other embedding algorithms in the literature. In the refined Mercator mode, the fast mode embedding result is taken as an initial condition in a ML estimation, which significantly improves the quality of the final embedding. Apart from its accuracy as an embedding tool, Mercator has the clear advantage of systematically inferring not only node orderings, or angular positions, but also the hidden degrees and global model parameters, and has the ability to embed networks with arbitrary degree distributions. Overall, our results suggest that mixing machine learning and ML techniques in a model-dependent framework can boost the meaningful mapping of complex networks.},

The geometric randomization (GR) model assumes a homogeneous distribution of the nodes in a hidden similarity space and uses rewirings of the links to find configurations that maximize a connection probability akin to that of the popularity-similarity geometric network models. The rewiring preserves exactly the original degree sequence, thus preventing fluctuations in the degree cutoff. The GR model is manifestly simple as it relies upon a single free parameter controlling the clustering of the rewired network, and it does not require the explicit estimation of hidden degree variables. We demonstrate the applicability of GR by implementing it as a null model for the analysis of community structure. As a result, we find that geometric and topological communities detected in real networks are consistent, while topological communities are also detected in randomized counterparts as an effect of structural constraints.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an introduction to phase transitions and critical phenomena on the one hand, and nonequilibrium patterns on the other, using the Ginzburg--Landau theory as a unified language. In the first part, mean-field theory is presented, for both statics and dynamics, and its validity tested self-consistently. As is well known, the mean-field approximation breaks down below four spatial dimensions, where it can be replaced by a scaling phenomenology. The Ginzburg--Landau formalism can then be used to justify the phenomenological theory using the renormalization group, which elucidates the physical and mathematical mechanism for universality. In the second part of the paper it is shown how near pattern forming linear instabilities of dynamical systems, a formally similar Ginzburg--Landau theory can be derived for nonequilibrium macroscopic phenomena. The real and complex Ginzburg--Landau equations thus obtained yield nontrivial solutions of the original dynamical system, valid near the linear instability. Examples of such solutions are plane waves, defects such as dislocations or spirals, and states of temporal or spatiotemporal (extensive) chaos.},

	Abstract = {The architecture of the human brain underlies human behavior and is extremely complex with multiple scales interacting with one another. However, research efforts are typically focused on a single spatial scale. We explored the spatial multiscale organization of the human brain by using two high-quality datasets with connectomes at five anatomical resolutions for 84 healthy subjects. We found that the zoomed-out layers remain self-similar and that a geometric network model, where distances are not Euclidean, predicts the observations by application of a renormalization protocol. Our results prove that the same principles organize brain connectivity at different scales and lead to efficient decentralized communication. Implications extend to debates, like criticality in the brain, and applications, including tools for brain simulation.Structural connectivity in the brain is typically studied by reducing its observation to a single spatial resolution. However, the brain possesses a rich architecture organized over multiple scales linked to one another. We explored the multiscale organization of human connectomes using datasets of healthy subjects reconstructed at five different resolutions. We found that the structure of the human brain remains self-similar when the resolution of observation is progressively decreased by hierarchical coarse-graining of the anatomical regions. Strikingly, a geometric network model, where distances are not Euclidean, predicts the multiscale properties of connectomes, including self-similarity. The model relies on the application of a geometric renormalization protocol which decreases the resolution by coarse-graining and averaging over short similarity distances. Our results suggest that simple organizing principles underlie the multiscale architecture of human structural brain networks, where the same connectivity law dictates short- and long-range connections between different brain regions over many resolutions. The implications are varied and can be substantial for fundamental debates, such as whether the brain is working near a critical point, as well as for applications including advanced tools to simplify the digital reconstruction and simulation of the brain.},

	Abstract = {We study the small-world network model, which mimics the transition between regular-lattice and random-lattice behavior in social networks of increasing size. We contend that the model displays a critical point with a divergent characteristic length as the degree of randomness tends to zero. We propose a real-space renormalization group transformation for the model and demonstrate that the transformation is exact in the limit of large system size. We use this result to calculate the exact value of the single critical exponent for the system, and to derive the scaling form for the average number of `degrees of separation' between two nodes on the network as a function of the three independent variables. We confirm our results by extensive numerical simulation.},

	Abstract = {The small-world transition is a first-order transition at zero density p
 of shortcuts, whereby the normalised shortest-path distance ℒ = l̄/L undergoes a discontinuity in the thermodynamic limit. On finite
 systems the apparent transition is shifted by Δp ∼ L−d.
 Equivalently a ``persistence size'' L* ∼ p−1/d can be defined in
 connection with finite-size effects. Assuming L* ∼ p−τ, simple
 rescaling arguments imply that τ = 1/d. We confirm this result by
 extensive numerical simulation in one to four dimensions, and argue that
 τ = 1/d implies that this transition is first order.},

Two large networks of string geometries are constructed, where nodes are extra-dimensional six-manifolds and edges represent topological transitions between them. We show that a standard bubble cosmology model on the networks has late-time behavior determined by the largest eigenvector of {\$}-(\backslashmathbf{\{}L{\}} + \backslashmathbf{\{}D{\}}){\$}, where {\$}\backslashmathbf{\{}L{\}}{\$} and {\$}\backslashmathbf{\{}D{\}}{\$} are the Laplacian and degree matrices of the networks, which provides a dynamical mechanism for vacuum selection in the string landscape.},

	Abstract = {The idea that spacetime geometry is built from quantum entanglement has been widely accepted in the last years. But how exactly the geometry is related with quantum states is still unclear. In this note, based on the idea of deep learning, we propose a mechanism for Susskind's QM=GR hypothesis, spacetime geometry as the optimal generative network of quantum states. We speculate that the space geometry stems as a geodesic tensor network which defines the quantum state complexity of a fundamental quantum state under a given metric. Spacetime corresponds to an evolving tensor network that generates an evolutional fundamental quantum system. This mechanism provides (a) a constructive correspondence between quantum states and spacetime geometry; (b)a spacetime structure emerging from a highly constrained geodesic so that the QEC-like structure shown in AdS/CFT can be naturally realized and (c) a mechanism to derive the gravity equation from the concept of quantum state complexity. With this mechanism, spacetime can have a quantum mechanical description. We hope this may lead to another view direction to understand the basic rules of our world.},

	Abstract = {Transport is an important function in many network systems and understanding its behavior on biological, social, and technological networks is crucial for a wide range of applications. However, it is a property that is not well understood in these systems, probably because of the lack of a general theoretical framework. Here, based on the finding that renormalization can be applied to bionetworks, we develop a scaling theory of transport in self-similar networks. We demonstrate the networks invariance under length scale renormalization, and we show that the problem of transport can be characterized in terms of a set of critical exponents. The scaling theory allows us to determine the influence of the modular structure on transport in metabolic and protein-interaction networks. We also generalize our theory by presenting and verifying scaling arguments for the dependence of transport on microscopic features, such as the degree of the nodes and the distance between them. Using transport concepts such as diffusion and resistance, we exploit this invariance, and we are able to explain, based on the topology of the network, recent experimental results on the broad flow distribution in metabolic networks.},

	Abstract = {Symmetries in physical theories denote invariance under some transformation, such as self-similarity under a change of scale. The renormalization group provides a powerful framework to study these symmetries, leading to a better understanding of the universal properties of phase transitions. However, the small-world property of complex networks complicates application of the renormalization group by introducing correlations between coexisting scales. Here, we provide a framework for the investigation of complex networks at different resolutions. The approach is based on geometric representations, which have been shown to sustain network navigability and to reveal the mechanisms that govern network structure and evolution. We define a geometric renormalization group for networks by embedding them into an underlying hidden metric space. We find that real scale-free networks show geometric scaling under this renormalization group transformation. We unfold the networks in a self-similar multilayer shell that distinguishes the coexisting scales and their interactions. This in turn offers a basis for exploring critical phenomena and universality in complex networks. It also affords us immediate practical applications, including high-fidelity smaller-scale replicas of large networks and a multiscale navigation protocol in hyperbolic space, which betters those on single layers.},

@article{Mandrysz2018,
	Abstract = {In this article we show that the ultralocal state of gravity can be associated with the so-called crumpled phase of gravity, observed e.g. in Causal Dynamical Triangulations. By considering anisotropic scaling present in the Ho$\backslash$v{\{}r{\}}ava-Lifshitz theory, we prove that in the ultralocal scaling limit ({\$}z \backslashrightarrow 0{\$}) the graph representing connectivity structure of space is becoming complete. In consequence, transition from the ultralocal phase ({\$}z=0{\$}) to the standard relativistic scaling ({\$}z=1{\$}) is implemented by the geometrogensis, similar to the one considered in Quantum Graphity approach. However, the relation holds only for the finite number of nodes {\$}N{\$} and in the continuous limit ({\$}N\backslashrightarrow \backslashinfty{\$}) the complete graph reduces to the set of disconnected points due to the weights {\$}w=1/N{\$} associated with the links. By coupling Ising spin matter to the considered graph we show that the process of geometrogensis can be associated with critical behavior. Based on both analytical and numerical analysis phase diagram of the system is reconstructed showing that (for a ring graph) symmetry broken phase occurs at {\$}z\backslashin [0, 0.5){\$}. Finally, cosmological consequences of the considered process of geometrogenesis as well as similarities with the so-called synaptic pruning are briefly discussed.},

@article{Mulder2017,
	Abstract = {Recently higher order networks describing the interactions between two or more nodes are attracting large attention. Most notably higher order networks include simplicial complexes formed not only by nodes and links but also by triangles, tetrahedra, etc. glued along their faces. Simplicial complexes and in general higher order networks are able to characterize data as different as functional brain networks or collaboration networks beyond the framework of pairwise interactions. Interestingly higher order networks have a natural geometric interpretation and therefore constitute the natural way to explore the discrete network geometry of complex networks. Here we investigate the rich interplay between emergent network geometry of higher order networks and their complexity in the framework of a non-equilibrium model called Network Geometry with Flavor. This model originally proposed for capturing the evolution of simplicial complexes is here extended in order to capture higher order networks formed not only by simplices but by any type of regular polytope. We reveal the interplay between complexity and geometry of the higher-order networks by studying the emergent community structure and the dependence of the degree distribution on the dimension and the Nature of the regular polytope forming the building blocks of the networked structure. Additionally we discuss the underlying hyperbolic Nature of the emergent geometry and we relate the spectral dimension of the higher-order network to the dimension and Nature of its building blocks.},

Turing's 1952 analysis suggests a more general theory. A powerful new method for analyzing onset of instability in arbitrary networks of compartments or model cells is developed. Network structure is found to influence interaction of intracellular chemical reactions and intercellular transfers, and thereby the stability of uniform stationary states of the network. With the theory, effects of changes in network topology can be treated systematically. Several regular planar and polyhedral networks provide illustrations. Influences of boundary conditions and intercellular permeabilities on patterns of instability are illustrated in simple networks. Non-linear aspects of instability are not treated.},

This represents a poverty of riches, however, since many of our analysis techniques cannot handle the resulting large (tens to hundreds of thousands of nodes) networks. In this paper, I provide a method for identifying dense regions within large networks based on a peer influence model. Using software familiar to most sociologists, the method reduces the network to a set of m position variables that can then be used in fast cluster analysis programs. The method is tested against simulated networks with a known small-world structure showing that the underlying clusters can be accurately recovered. I then compare the performance of the procedure with other subgroup detection algorithms on the MacRea and Gagnon prison friendship data and a larger adolescent friendship network, showing that the algorithm replicates other procedures for small networks and outperforms them on the larger friendship network.},

@article{Larremore2013,
	Abstract = {The var genes of the human malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum present a challenge to population geneticists due to their extreme diversity, which is generated by high rates of recombination. These genes encode a primary antigen protein called PfEMP1, which is expressed on the surface of infected red blood cells and elicits protective immune responses. Var gene sequences are characterized by pronounced mosaicism, precluding the use of traditional phylogenetic tools that require bifurcating tree-like evolutionary relationships. We present a new method that identifies highly variable regions (HVRs), and then maps each HVR to a complex network in which each sequence is a node and two nodes are linked if they share an exact match of significant length. Here, networks of var genes that recombine freely are expected to have a uniformly random structure, but constraints on recombination will produce network communities that we identify using a stochastic block model. We validate this method on synthetic data, showing that it correctly recovers populations of constrained recombination, before applying it to the Duffy Binding Like-α (DBLα) domain of var genes. We find nine HVRs whose network communities map in distinctive ways to known DBLα classifications and clinical phenotypes. We show that the recombinational constraints of some HVRs are correlated, while others are independent. These findings suggest that this micromodular structuring facilitates independent evolutionary trajectories of neighboring mosaic regions, allowing the parasite to retain protein function while generating enormous sequence diversity. Our approach therefore offers a rigorous method for analyzing evolutionary constraints in var genes, and is also flexible enough to be easily applied more generally to any highly recombinant sequences.},

	Abstract = {{High-throughput experimental technologies gradually shift the paradigm of biological research from hypothesis-validation toward hypothesis-generation science. Translating diverse types of large-scale experimental data into testable hypotheses, however, remains a daunting task. We previously demonstrated that heterogeneous genomics data can be integrated into a single genome-scale gene network with high prediction power for ribonucleic acid interference (RNAi) phenotypes in Caenorhabditis elegans, a popular metazoan model in the study of developmental biology, neurobiology and genetics. Here, we present WormNet version 3 (v3), which is a new network-assisted hypothesis-generating server for C. elegans. WormNet v3 includes major updates to the base gene network, which substantially improved predictions of RNAi phenotypes. The server generates various gene network-based hypotheses using three complementary network methods: (i) a phenotype-centric approach to `find new members for a pathway'; (ii) a gene-centric approach to `infer functions from network neighbors' and (iii) a context-centric approach to `find context-associated hub genes', which is a new method to identify key genes that mediate physiology within a specific context. For example, we demonstrated that the context-centric approach can be used to identify potential molecular targets of toxic chemicals. WormNet v3 is freely accessible at http://www.inetbio.org/wormnet.}},

	Abstract = {<p>Networks have become ubiquitous in the modern scientific literature, with recent work directed at understanding `temporal networks'---those networks having structure or topology which evolves over time. One area of active interest is pattern formation from reaction--diffusion systems, which themselves evolve over temporal networks. We derive analytical conditions for the onset of diffusive spatial and spatio-temporal pattern formation on undirected temporal networks through the Turing and Benjamin--Feir mechanisms, with the resulting pattern selection process depending strongly on the evolution of both global diffusion rates and the local structure of the underlying network. Both instability criteria are then extended to the case where the reaction--diffusion system is non-autonomous, which allows us to study pattern formation from time-varying base states. The theory we present is illustrated through a variety of numerical simulations which highlight the role of the time evolution of network topology, diffusion mechanisms and non-autonomous reaction kinetics on pattern formation or suppression. A fundamental finding is that Turing and Benjamin--Feir instabilities are generically transient rather than eternal, with dynamics on temporal networks able to transition between distinct patterns or spatio-temporal states. One may exploit this feature to generate new patterns, or even suppress undesirable patterns, over a given time interval.</p>},

	Abstract = {<p>The problem of Turing instabilities for a reaction-diffusion system defined on a complex Cartesian product network is considered. To this end we operate in the linear regime and expand the time dependent perturbation on a basis formed by the tensor product of the eigenvectors of the discrete Laplacian operators, associated to each of the individual networks that build the Cartesian product. The dispersion relation which controls the onset of the instability depends on a set of discrete wavelengths, the eigenvalues of the aforementioned Laplacians. Patterns can develop on the Cartesian network, if they are supported on at least one of its constitutive sub-graphs. Multiplex networks are also obtained under specific prescriptions. In this case, the criteria for the instability reduce to compact explicit formulae. Numerical simulations carried out for the Mimura-Murray reaction kinetics confirm the adequacy of the proposed theory.</p>},

	Abstract = {<p>The advances in understanding complex networks have generated increasing interest in dynamical processes occurring on them. Pattern formation in activator-inhibitor systems has been studied in networks, revealing differences from the classical continuous media. Here we study pattern formation in a new framework, namely multiplex networks. These are systems where activator and inhibitor species occupy separate nodes in different layers. Species react across layers but diffuse only within their own layer of distinct network topology. This multiplicity generates heterogeneous patterns with significant differences from those observed in single-layer networks. Remarkably, diffusion-induced instability can occur even if the two species have the same mobility rates; condition which can never destabilize single-layer networks. The instability condition is revealed using perturbation theory and expressed by a combination of degrees in the different layers. Our theory demonstrates that the existence of such topology-driven instabilities is generic in multiplex networks, providing a new mechanism of pattern formation.</p>},

@article{Kim2014,
	Abstract = {<p> The connectome, or the entire connectivity of a neural system represented by a network, ranges across various scales from synaptic connections between individual neurons to fibre tract connections between brain regions. Although the modularity they commonly show has been extensively studied, it is unclear whether the connection specificity of such networks can already be fully explained by the modularity alone. To answer this question, we study two networks, the neuronal network of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and the fibre tract network of human brains obtained through diffusion spectrum imaging. We compare them to their respective benchmark networks with varying modularities, which are generated by link swapping to have desired modularity values. We find several network properties that are specific to the neural networks and cannot be fully explained by the modularity alone. First, the clustering coefficient and the characteristic path length of both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and human connectomes are higher than those of the benchmark networks with similar modularity. High clustering coefficient indicates efficient local information distribution, and high characteristic path length suggests reduced global integration. Second, the total wiring length is smaller than for the alternative configurations with similar modularity. This is due to lower dispersion of connections, which means each neuron in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> connectome or each region of interest in the human connectome reaches fewer ganglia or cortical areas, respectively. Third, both neural networks show lower algorithmic entropy compared with the alternative arrangements. This implies that fewer genes are needed to encode for the organization of neural systems. While the first two findings show that the neural topologies are efficient in information processing, this suggests that they are also efficient from a developmental point of view. Together, these results show that neural systems are organized in such a way as to yield efficient features beyond those given by their modularity alone. </p>},

	Abstract = {Lots of learning tasks require dealing with graph data which contains rich relation information among elements. Modeling physics systems, learning molecular fingerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases demand a model to learn from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures (like the dependency trees of sentences and the scene graphs of images) is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are neural models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. In recent years, variants of GNNs such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), graph recurrent network (GRN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performances on many deep learning tasks. In this survey, we propose a general design pipeline for GNN models and discuss the variants of each component, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.},

	Abstract = {A large number of complex systems find a natural abstraction in the form of weighted networks whose nodes represent the elements of the system and the weighted edges identify the presence of an interaction and its relative strength. In recent years, the study of an increasing number of large-scale networks has highlighted the statistical heterogeneity of their interaction pattern, with degree and weight distributions that vary over many orders of magnitude. These features, along with the large number of elements and links, make the extraction of the truly relevant connections forming the network's backbone a very challenging problem. More specifically, coarse-graining approaches and filtering techniques come into conflict with the multiscale nature of large-scale systems. Here, we define a filtering method that offers a practical procedure to extract the relevant connection backbone in complex multiscale networks, preserving the edges that represent statistically significant deviations with respect to a null model for the local assignment of weights to edges. An important aspect of the method is that it does not belittle small-scale interactions and operates at all scales defined by the weight distribution. We apply our method to real-world network instances and compare the obtained results with alternative backbone extraction techniques.},
