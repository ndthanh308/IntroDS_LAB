\begin{abstract}


We realize collective enhancement and suppression of light scattered by an array of tweezer-trapped $^{87}$Rb atoms positioned within a strongly coupled Fabry-P\'{e}rot optical cavity.  We illuminate the array with light directed transverse to the cavity axis, in the low saturation regime, and detect photons scattered into the cavity.  
For an array with integer-optical-wavelength spacing each atom scatters light into the cavity with nearly identical scattering amplitude, leading to an observed $N^2$ scaling of cavity photon number as the atom number increases stepwise from $N=1$ to $N=8$.
By contrast, for an array with half-integer-wavelength spacing, destructive interference of scattering amplitudes yields a non-monotonic, sub-radiant cavity intensity versus $N$.  By analyzing the polarization of light emitted from the cavity, we find that Rayleigh scattering can be collectively enhanced or suppressed with respect to Raman scattering.  We observe also that atom-induced shifts and broadenings of the cavity resonance are precisely tuned by varying the atom number and positions.   Altogether, tweezer arrays provide exquisite control of atomic cavity QED spanning from the single- to the many-body regime.

\maketitle

As highlighted by Dicke's seminal work on super- and sub-radiance \cite{Dicke1954}, the interaction of multiple emitters with a quantum mode of light differs from that of the emitters individually.
Collective ``super-radiant'' (or ``bright'') states, resulting from constructive interference, give rise to an enhanced emission rate per excitation, which grows with the number of emitters.
Conversely, ``sub-radiant'' (or ``dark'') states arise from destructive interference, leading to a suppression or complete cancellation of photon emission. 



In the case of extended samples, with emitters distributed over distances longer than the emitted optical wavelength, the observation and control of super- and sub-radiance depends critically on the exact spatial distribution of the emitters.  For example, the precise structure of mesoscopic samples \cite{Clemens2003,Masson2020,Scully2006} or periodic emitter arrays \cite{Masson2022,Tamura2020,Rui2020} controls whether their collective emission is enhanced or suppressed, or directed into single or multiple optical modes.

In cavity quantum electrodyamics (QED), in which each of multiple emitters couples strongly to a single-mode cavity field, the properties of (and the access to) the bright and dark manifolds depend strongly on the spatial positions of emitters within the cavity.
Already for single emitters, controlling the position of atoms in a cavity advanced the field of cavity QED ~\cite{Guthohrlein2001,Nussmann2005,Reiserer2013a,Thompson2013a}. Basic effects of few-body cavity QED have been illustrated by the controlled placement of two atoms~\cite{Reimann2015,Neuzner2016} or ions~\cite{Casabone2015,Begley2016} within resonant cavities. 
Experiments on superconducting quantum circuits have extended studies of collective emission into microwave cavities and waveguides to as many as 10 qubits~\cite{Majer2007,VanLoo2013,Mirhosseini2019,Kannan2020,Wang2020a}.

In this work, we employ deterministically loaded atom tweezer arrays~\cite{Endres2016,Barredo2016}, a powerful new platform for quantum simulation~\cite{Browaeys2020}, metrology~\cite{Madjarov2019,Young2020}, and information processing~\cite{Kaufman2021}, to advance atomic cavity QED from the few- to the many-body regime while preserving precise control over the cavity interaction of each individual atom.
With such a tweezer array, we place a fixed number of $^{87}$Rb atoms at fully controlled positions along the axis of a strongly coupled Fabry-P\'{e}rot optical resonator~\cite{Liu2022,comment_zhang} [Fig.~\ref{fig:M1}(a)].
This method improves upon the incomplete control of atom number, position, and motion in previous approaches used in trapped-atom and -ion cavity QED experiments~\cite{Reiserer2015,Mivehvar2021}. 
By driving this emitter array with light propagating transverse to the cavity axis while monitoring the cavity emission, we prepare both super- and sub-radiant (single-excitation) states. We characterize these states via the number of photons present in the cavity, which scales as $N^2$ for super-radiant states and sublinearly for sub-radiant ones.

We employ an in-vacuum near-concentric Fabry-P\'{e}rot optical cavity with a TEM$_{00}$ mode whose frequency ($\omega_\mathrm{c}$)  lies near the transition frequency ($\omega_\mathrm{a}$) of the $^{87}$Rb $F=2 \rightarrow F^\prime=3$ $D_2$ transition (wavelength $\lambda = \SI{780}{\nano\meter}$) ~\cite{Deist2022a,Deist2022b}.
Near the cavity center, the coupling amplitude of a single $^{87}$Rb atom to this cavity mode varies as $g(x) = g_0 \cos kx$; here, $g_0 = 2 \pi \times 3.1$ MHz  (on the cycling transition) and $k = 2 \pi/\lambda$.  Given the atomic and cavity resonance half-linewidths of $\gamma = 2 \pi \times 3.0$ MHz and $\kappa = 2 \pi \times 0.53$ MHz, respectively, the cavity achieves the strong coupling condition with single-atom cooperativity $C = g_0^2/(2 \kappa \gamma) = 3.0$~\cite{Kimble1998}.

A one-dimensional array of optical tweezers is formed by laser beams with a wavelength of \SI{808}{\nano \meter} sent transversely to the cavity through a high numerical-aperture imaging system.
Pre-cooled and optically trapped $^{87}$Rb atoms are loaded into as many as 16 tweezers, detected through fluorescence imaging, and then sorted into regularly spaced arrays of $N=1$ to $8$ atoms~\cite{suppmat}\nocite{Madjarov2021a}. The total length of these arrays is much smaller than the $\sim \SI{1}{\milli\meter}$ cavity Rayleigh range. The array is aligned to place atoms at the radial center of the cavity.  Piezo-controlled mirrors and an acousto-optical deflector are used to position the array with nanometer-scale precision along the cavity axis.

Our experiments focus on the response of this atom array when it is driven optically.  
For this, we illuminate the array with a transverse standing-wave of monochromatic probe light, see Fig.~\ref{fig:M1}(a).
The probe is linearly polarized along the $z$-axis (chosen as our quantization axis), perpendicular to the cavity, and drives each atom with a spatially dependent Rabi frequency $\Omega(y)=\Omega_0 \cos{k y}$.
% standing wave
The standing-wave configuration balances photon recoil momentum, allows for positional calibration along the $y$-axis, and reduces incoherence in photon emission caused by atomic thermal motion~\cite{suppmat}.
We employ a weak probe amplitude to ensure that the probability of having more than one atom excited simultaneously is negligible.
%
All tweezer traps are centered at $y=0$. 
The probe frequency $\omega_\mathrm{p}$ operates at a small detuning  $\Delta_\mathrm{pc}=\omega_\mathrm{p}-\omega_\mathrm{c}$ from the cavity resonance [Fig.~\ref{fig:M1}(b)].  Prior to probe illumination, the tweezer-trapped atoms are polarization-gradient cooled and prepared in the $F=2$ ground hyperfine manifold, without control of their Zeeman state.  Probe light scattered by the array into the cavity, and thence through one mirror of our one-sided cavity, is detected by a single-photon counting module.

To demonstrate the strong sensitivity of collective cavity scattering on the exact positioning of the scatterers, we first examine an array of just two atoms.  As illustrated in Fig.\ \ref{fig:M2}(a), we first position one atom at an antinode of the cavity field.  With the cavity at a large detuning $\Delta_\mathrm{ca} = \omega_\mathrm{c} - \omega_\mathrm{a} = - 2 \pi \times 507$ MHz --- a specific ``magic'' value chosen to suppress fluctuations from internal-state dynamics, as described below --- we denote the steady-state cavity photon number generated by this single atom as $n_1$.  We then add a second atom at a variable distance $d$ from the first, and record the cavity photon number produced by the atom pair as $n_2$.  At integer-wavelength separation ($d = m \lambda$ with $m$ an integer), we observe super-radiant light scattering, where the total cavity emission rate is greater than that of two individual atoms ($n_2 > 2 n_1$).  At half-integer-wavelength separation ($d = (m+1/2) \lambda$), we observe sub-radiant light scattering ($n_2 < 2 n_1$).

To account for the observed behavior, let us consider that each atom $i$, positioned at location $(x_i, y_i)$, serves as a source for light in the cavity, with elastic scattering amplitude $\eta(x_i, y_i) = g(x_i) \Omega(y_i)/2 \Delta_\mathrm{ca} \equiv \eta_0 \cos kx_i \cos ky_i$, which we obtain by treating the atom as a two-level emitter and adiabatically eliminating its excited state.  The scattering amplitudes from all atoms add coherently.  The steady-state cavity photon number scattered by $N$ atoms is then $n_N = |\bar{a}|^2 $, where the expectation value of the cavity-field amplitude is given, following a semi-classical treatment~\cite{Domokos2002,Tanji-Suzuki2011,suppmat} in the dispersive coupling regime $|\Delta_\mathrm{ca}| \gg \{\Omega_0,g_0,\gamma\}$, as
\begin{align}
\bar{a}=\frac{\sum_{i}\eta(x_i,y_i)}{[\Delta_\mathrm{pc}-\sum_{i} g^2(x_i)/\Delta_\mathrm{ca} ] + i[\kappa + \sum_{i} \gamma g^2(x_i)/{\Delta_\mathrm{ca}^2}  ]}.
\label{eq:CavityField}
\end{align}
Here, we have accounted for the atom-induced dispersive shift $\sum_i g^2(x_i)/\Delta_\mathrm{ca}$ and absorptive broadening $\sum_i \gamma g^2(x_i)/\Delta_\mathrm{ca}^2$ of the cavity resonance.

At large $|\Delta_\mathrm{ca}|$, where we can neglect atom-induced modifications of the cavity resonance, and with $\Delta_\mathrm{pc}=0$, the cavity photon number varies simply as $n_N = |\sum_i \eta(x_i, y_i)|^2/\kappa^2$.  For two atoms, with the first situated exactly at the antinode and the second at an exact axial distance $d$, one then expects $n_2/n_1 = [1+\cos kd]^2$, with limiting values $n_2/n_1 = 4$ from constructive interference at integer-wavelength separation, and $n_2/n_1 = 0$ from destructive interference at half-integer-wavelength separation.  In our experiment, uncorrelated fluctuations in $\eta$, deriving from thermal position fluctuations of the two atoms within their tweezer traps, constrain these limiting values to $n_2/n_1 = 2 \left( 1 \pm D  \right)$, where the ratio $D = |\langle \eta\rangle|^2/ \langle |\eta|^2\rangle$ is the Debye-Waller factor and $\langle \rangle$ denotes an average over the position distribution of a single trapped atom.  The data in Fig.\ \ref{fig:M2}(a) are consistent with root mean square variations of $\sigma = 100(14)$ nm in both the $x$ and $y$ directions of motion, with  $\sigma$ determined independently by measuring light scattering from a single atom \cite{suppmat}.  In future work, $\sigma$ can be reduced further through bursts of dark-state cooling ~\cite{Kaufman2012,AngOngA2022,Brown2019}.  Strong contrast between constructive and destructive interference is retained even at large atomic separations -- as far as  $d\simeq \SI{30}{\micro\meter}$.

The photon scattering rate also depends on the positions of the atoms with respect to the standing-wave cavity mode. 
We illustrate this dependence by measuring light scattering from atom arrays with fixed integer- or half-integer-wavelength spacing while translating these arrays altogether by $\Delta x$ from a cavity antinode [Fig.\ \ref{fig:M2}(b)].  Again, we observe either super- or sub-radiance when the array is aligned onto cavity antinodes.  In contrast, when either type of array is aligned to cavity nodes, we observe scattering that scales linearly with $N$.  Here, position fluctuations cause the scattering amplitude from each atom to vary between positive and negative values with equal probability, producing a cavity field with finite variance but zero average amplitude.

The super-radiant emission by atoms at the constructive interference condition is further enhanced by increasing the atom number [Fig.\ \ref{fig:M3}(a)].  At large $|\Delta_\mathrm{ca}|$ and on cavity resonance, the number of cavity photons emitted by an $N$-atom array is predicted to be
\begin{align}
n_N = \left[ N\left(\braket{|\eta|^2}-\lvert\braket{\eta}\rvert^2\right)+N^2 \lvert\braket{\eta}\rvert^2\right]/\kappa^2.
\label{eq:N_atom_constructive}
\end{align}
This expression consists of an incoherent part that scales linearly with $N$ and that vanishes if atoms are fully localized ($\sigma=0$), and a coherent part that scales quadratically as $N^2$.  Our measurements with $N$ ranging from 1 to 8 match well with this prediction, clearly exhibiting super-radiant scattering.

At the destructive interference condition, i.e.\ an atom array with half-integer-wavelength spacing, collective scattering is sub-radiant, falling below the linear scaling with $N$ expected for an incoherent sample.  Here, at similar probe and cavity settings, one expects the cavity photon number to vary as 
\begin{align}
n_N = \left[ N\left(\braket{|\eta^2|}-\lvert\braket{\eta}\rvert^2\right)+\frac{1-(-1)^N}{2} \lvert\braket{\eta}\rvert^2 \right]/\kappa^2.
\label{eq:N_atom_destructive}
\end{align}
While the incoherent scattering rate remains linear in $N$, the coherent photon scattering by pairs of atoms with opposite phase cancel out,  resulting in a total coherent contribution equal to that of either zero emitters (even $N$) or a single emitter (odd $N$).
The non-monotonic behavior observed in our experiment emerges as the coherent scattering rate exceeds the incoherent one: $\lvert\braket{\eta}\rvert^2>\braket{\lvert\eta^2\rvert}-\lvert\braket{\eta}\rvert^2$.

At smaller detuning $|\Delta_\mathrm{ca}|$, collective light scattering is affected by two additional effects.  First,  coherent scattering is degraded by polarization and intensity fluctuations arising from internal state dynamics of the multi-level $^{87}$Rb atom.  In our setup, incoherent Raman scattering causes each atom's magnetic quantum number $m_F$ to be distributed among all possible values.  For small $\Delta_\mathrm{ca} = - 2 \pi \times 38$ MHz, the amplitude $\eta$ for emitting $z$-polarized light, arising primarily from the near-resonant $F=2 \rightarrow F^\prime = 3$ transition, varies strongly with $m_F$.  This random variation further degrades the Debye-Waller factor, reducing the the collective enhancement of light scattering as shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:M3}(a).

Furthermore, at this detuning, atoms can scatter the $z$-polarized probe light into cavity modes of two orthogonal polarizations. Scattering into the $z$-polarized cavity mode, i.e.\ Rayleigh scattering, does not change the spin state of the ground-state atoms.  The final spin state after Rayleigh scattering is independent of which atom scattered a photon.  Thus, the Rayleigh scattering rate is determined by the interference of the scattering amplitudes from all atoms, allowing for enhancement or suppression.  In contrast, scattering into the $y$-polarized cavity mode, i.e.\ Raman scattering, does change the spin state of the ground state. In our experiment, it is reasonable to assume the ground-state atoms are, at all times, in an incoherent mixture of spin states owing to imprecise initial state preparation and rapid state-collapse caused by incoherent light scattering. Given that the final spin states produced by each atom Raman scattering a photon are orthogonal, and absent coherence among initial spin states, the Raman scattering rates in our experiment add incoherently.
By operating in other regimes which allow for coherences among the ground states, collective Raman scattering can indeed be observed~\cite{Bohnet2012,Zhiqiang2017,Landini2018,Kroeze2018}.

In support of this description, we examine separately the cavity emission of $z$- and $y$-polarized light [Fig.~\ref{fig:M3}(b)].  At small detuning, and in comparison to the light polarization emitted by a single atom, the emission of $z$-polarized light (relative to $y$-polarized light) is enhanced by super-radiant scattering at integer-wavelength atomic spacing and suppressed by sub-radiant scattering at half-integer-wavelength atomic spacing.

For much of our work, we avoid these internal-state and polarization effects by operating at the aforementioned ``magic'' detuning of $\Delta_\mathrm{ca} = - 2\pi \times 507$ MHz~\cite{suppmat,paper_in_perp}.  Here, when accounting for transitions to all three accessible excited hyperfine states ($F^\prime = 1$, $2$, and $3$), the amplitude for scattering $z$-polarized light is nearly identical for all Zeeman states within the ground $F=2$ manifold.  Simultaneously, the rate for Raman scattering $y$-polarized light is nearly extinguished, as observed in the nearly pure $z$-polarization of light emitted from the cavity [Fig.\ \ref{fig:M3}(c)].
The identification of such a ``magic'' detuning for nearly all alkali species~\cite{suppmat,paper_in_perp}, which allows light scattering by an alkali atom to resemble closely that of just a two-level atom, should be beneficial to other quantum optics experiments using alkali gases.

Additionally, at small detuning, we observe significant modifications of the cavity resonance by the atomic array within. As shown in Fig.\ \ref{fig:M4}(a), we record $n_N$ for various arrays as a function of the detuning $\Delta_\mathrm{pc}$ of the probe from the empty-cavity resonance.  From the observed emission lineshapes, we extract the atom-induced cavity resonance shift and also the total cavity linewidth.  The measured spectral shifts and widths show a near-linear dependence on the atom number $N$ [Fig.~\ref{fig:M4}(c-d)], and agree well with a theoretical calculation accounting for both atomic position and $m_F$ fluctuations ~\cite{suppmat}.    
Owing to the $g^2(x_i)$ dependence of the cavity dispersion and absorption terms, the atom-induced cavity modification is the same for atoms at both integer- and half-integer-wavelength spacing.  
Notably, these modifications are reduced for atom arrays centered on the cavity field nodes, and such spatial dependence is the foundation of optomechanical coupling between the atomic motion and the cavity field~\cite{Baumann2010,Kohler2018}.
By comparison, the atom-induced cavity modifications are all negligible for large $|\Delta_\mathrm{ca}|$.


While the current work explores only the bottom of the Dicke ladder, where only one atom is excited, our platform enables study of many-excitation super- or sub-radiance~\cite{Dicke1954,Gross1982}, up to full or zero state inversion respectively, with unprecedented control.
The interplay between atomic quantum states, collective atom-cavity interaction, and optical emission properties can be fully explored~\cite{Hotter2023}.
Our setup would provide insight into key features of many-body decay in the presence of multiple decay channels (due to the multimode nature of the cavity), such as the scaling with atom number of the peak intensity and the time of peak emission, as well as large shot-to-shot fluctuations~\cite{Clemens2004,PineiroOrioli2022,Cardenas-Lopez2022} in the light polarization due to self-reinforcing feedback.


Our realization of a well-controlled many-body cavity QED system, compatible with single-atom control, offers a wide range of potential quantum applications.
When single-photon cavity emission is subradiantly suppressed, multi-photon emission becomes the dominant process, leading to a non-linear photon source~\cite{Habibian2011,Neuzner2016}.
Encoding quantum information in a symmetrically excited W state or related states~\cite{Cabello2002} can superradiantly speed up information exchange between matter and itinerant photons. This accelerates quantum communications and reduces the infidelity accumulated over the interaction time~\cite{Casabone2015,Zhong2017}.
The possibility of switching between super- and sub-radiant states, through either phase rotation on individual atoms or moving the tweezers, allows on-demand multi-photon storage and emission~\cite{Holzinger2022}. 

Finally, coherent long-range photon-mediated momentum~\cite{Mivehvar2021,Ritsch2013,Luo2023} or spin~\cite{Hosten2016b,Welte2018,Periwal2021a,Greve2022,Li2023a} exchanges between individual atoms can be facilitated through subsequent absorption of the cavity photons by the atoms and can be used for quantum simulation on the Dicke model~\cite{Kirton2019d}, entanglement generation~\cite{Li2022b}, or realization of quantum solvers~\cite{Torggler2019}.
Notably, atom arrays that combine long-range photon-mediated interactions with short-range Rydberg interactions could benefit from the advantages of both types of interactions with distinct ranges, connectivity, and time scales~\cite{Ramette2022,Huie2021a,Ocola2022}.
