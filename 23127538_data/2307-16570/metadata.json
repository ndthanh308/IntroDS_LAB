  "abstract": "Since the appearance of H. Robbins article (1948), the central limit theorems for random sums have been studied for about 70 years. The central limit theorems for random sums of independent random variables play a very important role in various disciplines such as statistics, financial mathematics, insurance, etc. The purpose of this paper is to randomize some well-known classical and non-classical central limit theorems for sums of independent (not necessarily identically distributed) random variables of a double sequence, with the conditions for determining their validity. The results obtained in this paper are extensions and generalizations of known ones.",
