  "abstract": "According to traditional theory, it is believed that Fermions do not exhibit superradiation. However, when predetermined boundary conditions are in place, there is a possibility of combining the wave function of coupled Fermions, which can result in the emergence of superradiation phenomena. This article presents a novel perspective, proposing that Fermions have the potential to display superradiation phenomena. This implies that there is a broader scope for investigating superradiation and its relationship with boundary conditions.",
