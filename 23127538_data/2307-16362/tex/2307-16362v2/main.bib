  abstract      = {We present the results of a new, comprehensive investigation of the         radio spectral index of the Crab Nebula supernova remnant. New         data at 74 MHz are combined with data at 327 MHz, 1.5 GHz, and 5         GHz. In contrast to previous claims, little spatial variation in         the spectral index is seen. In particular, between 327 MHz and 5         GHz we see no evidence of spectral steepening near the edge of         the Nebula, the ``jet,'' or the ionized filaments. The rms         limits on any spectral index variations in these regions amount         to no more than 0.01. We believe that earlier reports of large         steepening were the result of correlator bias and image         registration problems. An elongated feature was detected 1'         northwest of the pulsar, which may be a continuation of the         well-known wisplike structures seen closer to the center of the         Nebula. At 74 MHz, we see for the first time evidence of free-         free absorption by the thermal material in the Crab Nebula's         filaments. Apart from some possible renewed acceleration         occurring in the wisps, the dominant accelerator of relativistic         electrons in the Crab Nebula is the pulsar itself.},

  abstract = {Between glitches, the rotational slowdown of the Crab pulsar is well         described by a power law with braking index         2.51{\ensuremath{\pm}}0.01. Six glitches occurred during the         period from 1969 to 1993; the largest, in 1989, occurred while         observations were in progress and was observed in unprecedented         detail. The discontinuous changes in rotation at each glitch         include components whose effect decays over periods of between 1         and about 200 d; the main effect, however, is an increase of         slowdown rate at the time of each glitch. This increase is         persistent and cumulative, contributing an overall increase of         0.07 per cent in the slowdown rate over the 23 years.         The two largest glitches, in 1975         and 1989, were very similar in form. In both there was a         discontinuous increase in rotation rate, followed by a decay         with time constant of order 20 d. In the 1989 glitch, part of         the step increase was resolved as an asymptotic exponential rise         with a time constant of 0.8 d. In four of the glitches there was         also a delayed increase in rotation rate, in the form of another         asymptotic exponential rise with a time constant of order 200 d.},

Power efficiency, computational "bang for the buck" and system capability for a handful of flagship science projects were important criteria in choosing the nature of the computers and the data centre itself. Here we outline some of the lessons learned in putting together the systems and the data centre that hosts Canada's fastest computer to date.},

The correlation algorithm is explained         in detail, as are some of the novel modes that software         correlation has enabled, such as wide-field VLBI imaging through         the use of multiple phase centres and pulsar gating and binning.         This is followed by an overview of the software architecture.         Finally, the performance of the correlator as a function of         number of CPU cores, telescopes and spectral channels is shown.},
