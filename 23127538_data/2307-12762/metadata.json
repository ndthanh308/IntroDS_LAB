  "abstract": "Negacyclic BCH codes are an important subclass of negacyclic codes and are the best linear codes in most cases, but their parameters are hard to determine. In this paper, we mainly study two types of negacyclic BCH codes of length $n=\\frac{q^{m}-1}{4},\\frac{q^{m}+1}{4}$, and give their dimensions and the lower bound on their minimum distance. Furthermore, we provide the weight distribution of narrow-sense neagcyclic BCH codes of length $n=\\frac{q^m-1}{4}$ for some special designed distances.",
