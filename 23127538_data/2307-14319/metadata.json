  "abstract": "We construct symbolic dynamics for three dimensional flows with positive speed. More precisely, for each $χ>0$, we code a set of full measure for every invariant probability measure which is $χ$-hyperbolic. These include all ergodic measures with entropy bigger than $χ$ as well as all hyperbolic periodic orbits of saddle-type with Lyapunov exponent outside of $[-χ,χ]$. This contrasts with a previous work of Lima & Sarig which built a coding associated to a given invariant probability measure. As an application, we code homoclinic classes of measures by suspensions of irreducible countable Markov shifts.",
