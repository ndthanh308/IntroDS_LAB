We introduce a new analytic framework to analyze the convergence of the Randomized Stochastic Gradient Descent Ascent (RSGDA) algorithm for stochastic minimax optimization problems. 
Under the so-called NC-P{\L} condition on one of the variables, our analysis improves the state-of-the-art convergence results in the current literature and hence broadens the applicable range of the RSGDA. 
We also introduce a simple yet effective strategy to accelerate RSGDA , and empirically validate its efficiency on both synthetic data and real data.

\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we establish a new convergence analysis for RSGDA under milder assumptions beyond strong concavity.
In particular, we show that RSGDA has the same convergence rate with SGDA in the NC-P{\L} condition, which is a better complexity compared with the previous analysis of RSGDA.
Moreover, we propose an intuitive method to choose the parameter $p$ for RSGDA and confirm its efficiency in experiments. 
There are quite a few works worthy to be considered in the future. 
On the one hand, it is still an open question whether there exists a tighter complexity bound for the minimax problems in the NC-P{\L} condition or even more general cases. 
On the other hand, a more efficient adaptive RSGDA for minimax optimization needs further investigation. 
% First, how to design adaptive algorithms for the minimax problems?
% Moreover, it is still an open question that what is the lower complexity bound for the minimax problems in the NC-P{\L} condition.
% Furthermore, does RSGDA still hold for the general minimax problems?
