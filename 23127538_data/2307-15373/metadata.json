  "abstract": "With the end of Moore's Law and the increasing demand for computing, photonic accelerators are garnering considerable attention. This is due to the physical characteristics of light, such as high bandwidth and multiplicity, and the various synchronization phenomena that emerge in the realm of laser physics. These factors come into play as computer performance approaches its limits. In this study, we explore the application of a laser network, acting as a photonic accelerator, to the competitive multi-armed bandit problem. In this context, conflict avoidance is key to maximizing environmental rewards. We experimentally demonstrate cooperative decision-making using zero-lag and lag synchronization within a network of four semiconductor lasers. Lag synchronization of chaos realizes effective decision-making and zero-delay synchronization is responsible for the realization of the collision avoidance function. We experimentally verified a low collision rate and high reward in a fundamental 2-player, 2-slot scenario, and showed the scalability of this system. This system architecture opens up new possibilities for intelligent functionalities in laser dynamics.",
