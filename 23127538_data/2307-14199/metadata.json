  "abstract": "The hydrometallurgical method of zinc production involves leaching zinc from ore and then separating the solid residue from the liquid solution by pressure filtration. This separation process is very important since the solid residue contains some moisture that can reduce the amount of zinc recovered. This study modeled the pressure filtration process through Random Forest (RF) and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The models take continuous variables (extracted features) from the lab samples as inputs. Thus, regression models namely Random Forest Regression (RFR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR) were chosen. A total dataset was obtained during the pressure filtration process in two conditions: 1) Polypropylene (S1) and 2) Polyester fabrics (S2). To predict the cake moisture, solids concentration (0.2 and 0.38), temperature (35 and 65 centigrade), pH (2, 3.5, and 5), pressure, cake thickness (14, 20, 26, and 34 mm), air-blow time (2, 10 and 15 min) and filtration time were applied as input variables. The models' predictive accuracy was evaluated by the coefficient of determination (R2) parameter. The results revealed that the RFR model is superior to the SVR model for cake moisture prediction.",
