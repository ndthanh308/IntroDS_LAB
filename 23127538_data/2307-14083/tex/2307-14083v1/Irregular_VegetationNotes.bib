@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="In Appendix \ref {app:ME} we show how to determine the expressions for the coefficients $D, A$ and $r$ as a function of the rates hereby introduced. More precisely, the diffusion coefficient is obtained as the limit $D = \protect \qopname  \relax m{lim}_{\Omega \rightarrow \infty } \delta /\Omega $. Similarly, the growth rate is obtained as the limit $r = \protect \qopname  \relax m{lim}_{\Omega \rightarrow \infty } r_2/\Omega $. Finally $A=r_1/r_2$."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="Note that the dependence of $\beta _c$ on the parameter $a$ is irrelevant for the problem because, by definition, $a>1$. Therefore, there will always exist a critical threshold on the average density $\beta $."}
