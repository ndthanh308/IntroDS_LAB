  "abstract": "In this paper the long-time dynamics of the massive Thirring model is investigated. Firstly the nonlinear steepest descent method for Riemann-Hilbert problem is explored to obtain the soliton resolution of the solutions to the massive Thirring model whose initial data belong to some weighted-Sobolev spaces. Secondly, the asymptotic stability of multi-solitons follow as a corollary. The main difficulty in studying the massive Thirring model through inverse scattering is that the corresponding Lax pair has singularities at the origin and infinity. We overcome this difficulty by making use of two transforms that separate the singularities.",
