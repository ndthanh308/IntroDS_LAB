  "abstract": "To present Mercer large-scale kernel machines from a ridge function perspective, we recall the results by Lin and Pinkus from {\\it Fundamentality of ridge functions}. We consider the main result of the recent paper by Rachimi and Recht, 2008, {\\it Random features for large-scale kernel machines} from the Approximation Theory point of view. We study which kernels could be approximated by a sum of products of cosine functions with arguments depending on $x$ and $y$ and present the obstacles of such an approach. The results of this article are applied to Image Processing by procedure \"one-vs-rest\".",
