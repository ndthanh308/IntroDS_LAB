  "abstract": "Detecting leaks in water networks is a costly challenge. This article introduces a practical solution: the integration of optical network with water networks for efficient leak detection. Our approach uses a fiber-optic cable to measure vibrations, enabling accurate leak identification and localization by an intelligent algorithm. We also propose a method to access leak severity for prioritized repairs. Our solution detects even small leaks with flow rates as low as 0.027 L/s. It offers a cost-effective way to improve leak detection, enhance water management, and increase operational efficiency.",
