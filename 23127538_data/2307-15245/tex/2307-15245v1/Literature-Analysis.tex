\section{Findings From The Literature}
In this section we provide our findings from the literature after reviewing a corpus of 200 papers. 
\subsection{Overview of Our Corpus}

\subsection{Non-IID Partitioning}
In the existing literature, the majority of works have focused on label distribution skew case. We find the following ways to simulate label distribution skew from the prior arts: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Label skew($p\%$):} in this case $p\%$ of the total classes are being randomly selected for each clients; then, each class data points are being partitioned amongst the clients who have that class.
    \item \textbf{Label Dir($\alpha$):} in this case each client draws a random vector from $\textit{Dir}(\alpha)$ for their class data points; then, each class data points are being partitioned amongst clients based on each clients' proportions.
    \item \textbf{Random shard($p$):} in this case, dataset is being partitioned into shards based on the number of clients, where each shard has only one class; then, each client receives $p$ random shards. In this scenario, clients have at most $p$ classes. 
    \item \textbf{Quantity Dir($\alpha$):} in this case each client draws a random number from $\textit{Dir}(\alpha)$ for their data points; then, data points are being randomly partitioned amongst clients based on each clients' data proportions.
    \item \textbf{Affine Distribution Shift:}
    \item \textbf{Feature noise:} 
\end{itemize}
Figure~\ref{} shows the demographic percentage of Non-IID simulation ways used in our corpus. Leaf also provides a simulated Non-IID partitions based the natural inherent Non-IID.

\subsection{Evaluation Metrics}

\subsection{Confounding Variables}

\subsection{Differences in Methodology}

\subsection{Hyper-parameters and Settings}
In fact we find that prior works compare with each other under different settings and hyper-parameters. Figure~\ref{} shows 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dataset and Architecture demographic
    \item Accuracy results demographic 
    \item Non-IID setting demographic
\end{itemize}
