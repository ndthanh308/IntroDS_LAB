\section{Conclusions}
Editing the appearance of dynamic 3D scenes is an important and challenging task.
In this paper, we propose a method for editing the local appearance of dynamic 3D scenes by modifying individual frames in the video.
Through our proposed trackable local surface, we are able to precisely edit the local appearance of the dynamic scene in a temporally coherent manner. Experiments have demonstrated that our method can achieve high-quality results on a variety of dynamic scenes.
