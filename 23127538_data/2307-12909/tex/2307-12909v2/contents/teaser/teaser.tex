scene in a user-friendly manner. Given training videos (a) and the reconstructed dynamic NeRF (b) as input, users can edit the appearance of the dynamic NeRF (d) by manipulating pixels in a single image (c). 
% 这能让我们渲染编辑后的动态场景进行dynamic view 生成
% This enables us to render the edited dynamic scene for dynamic view synthesis (e).
Experiment results demonstrate that our method can produce spatially and temporally consistent renderings (e). %More results are presented in the supplementary video.

% \caption{Our method enables \textit{temporally consistent} and easy video editing via manipulation in the 2D atlas domain. Given a natural video as input (a), our method estimates a set of \emph{layered 2D atlases} (b), each providing a unified and interpretable parameterization of an object's, or background's appearance throughout the video. Our method further estimates a mapping from each pixel in the video to a 2D point in each atlas, and its opacity. This enables any edits made to the atlases (c) to be consistently and automatically propagated to all frames of the video (d). In this example, edits have been applied to the two atlases: flowers are added to the dress, and the bench is painted with rainbow colors; these edits are faithfully projected to the original frames, while preserving the deformation of the dress and complex scene effects as shadows. }
