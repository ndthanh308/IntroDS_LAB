  "abstract": "Let $T := \\mathbb{G}_m^d$ be the torus acting on the Quot scheme of points $\\coprod_n \\mathrm{Quot}_{\\mathcal{O}^r/\\mathbb{A}^d/\\mathbb{Z}}^n$ via the standard action on $\\mathbb{A}^d$. We analyze the fixed locus of the Quot scheme under this action. In particular we show that for $d \\leq 2$ or $r \\leq 2$, this locus is smooth, and that for $d \\geq 4$ and $r \\geq 3$ it satisfies Murphy's law as introduced by Vakil, meaning that it has arbitrarily bad singularities. These results are obtained by giving a decomposition of the fixed locus into connected components, and identifying the components with incidence schemes of subspaces of $\\mathbb{P}^{r-1}$. We then obtain a characterization of the incidence schemes which occur, in terms of their graphs of incidence relations.",
