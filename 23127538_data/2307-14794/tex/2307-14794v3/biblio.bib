    abstract = "{We report upon an experimental study of internal gravity waves generated by the large-amplitude vertical oscillations of a circular cylinder in uniformly stratified fluid. Quantitative measurements are performed using a modified synthetic schlieren technique for strongly stratified solutions of NaCl or NaI. The oscillatory forcing leads to the development of turbulence in the region bounding the cylinder. This turbulence is found to be the primary source of the observed quasimonochromatic wave beams, whose characteristics at early times differ from theoretical predictions and experimental investigations of waves generated by small-amplitude cylinder oscillations. In particular, their wavelength is set by the Ozmidov scale rather than the size of the cylinder. The wave frequency is set by the buoyancy frequency N if the cylinder frequency is larger or much less than N. Otherwise it is set by the cylinder oscillation frequency. Over long times the finite-amplitude waves that have propagated away from their source are observed to break down and the process is examined quantitatively through conductivity probe measurements and qualitatively through unprocessed synthetic schlieren images. From an analysis of the location of wave breakdown we determine that the likely mechanism for breakdown is through parametric subharmonic instability. This conclusion is supported by fully nonlinear numerical simulations of the evolution of a temporally, although not spatially, monochromatic internal wave beam.}",

    abstract = "{The present work investigates the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) for the three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction of unsteady gravity currents from limited data. In the PINN context, the flow fields are reconstructed by training a neural network whose objective function penalizes the mismatch between the network predictions and the observed data and embeds the underlying equations using automatic differentiation. This study relies on a high-fidelity numerical experiment of the canonical lock-exchange configuration. This allows us to benchmark quantitatively the PINNs reconstruction capabilities on several training databases that mimic state-of-the-art experimental measurement techniques for density and velocity. Notably, spatially averaged density measurements by the light attenuation technique (LAT) are employed for the training procedure. We propose an experimental setup that combines density measurement by LAT and two independent planar velocity measurements by particle image velocimetry (PIV). The so-called LAT-2PIV setup gives the most promising results for flow reconstruction by PINNs, with respect to its accuracy and cost efficiency.}",
