\section{Responsible AI Guidelines and Roles}
\label{app:roles}

\begin{table}[h!]
\caption{\textbf{Responsible AI Guidelines and Roles.} Each guideline has been assigned to one or more relevant roles. Based on previous literature~\cite{wang2023designing, wong2023seeing, madaio2020co}, we have identified three main roles: \emph{a)} decision-maker or advisor; \emph{b)} engineer or researcher; and \emph{c)} designer. The label `All' indicates that a given guideline is applicable to all three roles.}
