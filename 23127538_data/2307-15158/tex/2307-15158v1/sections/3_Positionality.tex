\section{Author Positionality Statement}
\label{sec:positionality}
Understanding researcher positionality is crucial for transparently examining our perspectives on methodology, data collection, and analyses~\cite{frluckaj2022gender, havens2020situated}. In this paper, we situate ourselves in a Western country during the 21\textsuperscript{st} century, writing as authors primarily engaged in academic and industry research. Our team comprises three males and two females from Southern, Eastern, and North Europe, and Middle East with diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds. Our collective expertise spans various fields, including human-computer interaction (HCI), ubiquitous computing, software engineering, artificial intelligence, data visualization, and digital humanities.

It is important to recognize that our backgrounds and experiences have shaped our positionality. As HCI researchers affiliated with a predominantly Western organization, we acknowledge the need to expand the understanding of the research questions and methodology presented in this paper. Consequently, our positionality may have influenced the subjectivity inherent in framing our research questions, selecting our methodology, designing our study, and interpreting and analyzing our data.
