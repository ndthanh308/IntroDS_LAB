An advantage of our approach is that it allows adaption to different humans whose behaviour changes over time.\\

We compare our approach against three methods: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Oracle:} This approach knows the ground truth latent state of the human and provides and upper bound on the performance of our method. 
    \item \textbf{SAC:} This approaches does not explicitly model the dynamics of a human
    \item \textbf{LILI:} This approach learns the dynamics of a human and provides a baseline to compare our approach against.
    \item \textbf{MMBT}: Our approach that adapts to unseen human's with changing behaviour.
\end{itemize}
