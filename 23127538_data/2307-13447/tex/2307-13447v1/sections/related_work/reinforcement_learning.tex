Reinforcement learning (RL) techniques enable robots to learn optimum decisions in stationary environments.  However, the human can be considered as part of the environment in pHRC scenarios, so the environmental dynamics change when human behaviour alters ("non-stationarity"). Thus, traditional RL methods yield sub-optimal decisions in pHRC scenarios. \theo{citation  is needed in all the above}
