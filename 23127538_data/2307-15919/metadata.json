  "abstract": "An effective action for the bulk dynamics of quantum Hall effect in arbitrary even spatial dimensions was obtained some time ago in terms of a Chern-Simons term associated with the Dolbeault index theorem. Here we explore further properties of this action, showing how electronic band structures can be incorporated, obtaining Hall currents and conductivity (for arbitrary dimensions) in terms of integrals of Chern classes for the bands. We also derive the expression for Hall viscosity from the effective action. Explicit formulae for the Hall viscosity are given for 2+1 and 4+1dimensions.",
