A posteriori error estimates based on residuals can be used for reliable error
control of numerical methods. Here, we consider them in the context of ordinary
differential equations and Runge-Kutta methods. In particular, we take the
approach of Dedner \& Giesselmann (2016) and investigate it when used to select
the time step size. We focus on step size control stability when combined with
explicit Runge-Kutta methods and demonstrate that a standard I controller is
unstable while more advanced PI and PID controllers can be designed to be
stable. We compare the stability properties of residual-based
estimators and classical error estimators based on an embedded Runge-Kutta method
both analytically and in numerical experiments.
