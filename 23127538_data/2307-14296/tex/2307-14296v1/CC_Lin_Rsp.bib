Relativistic eﬀects caused by the presence of an atom of a heavy element in a compound can appreciably, even drastically, alter the NMR shifts of the nearby nuclei. A fundamental understanding of such relativistic eﬀects on NMR shifts is important in many branches of chemical and physical science. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the tools, concepts, and periodic trends pertaining to the shielding eﬀects by a neighboring heavy atom in diamagnetic systems, with particular emphasis on the “spin-orbit heavy-atom eﬀect on the light-atom” NMR shift (SO-HALA eﬀect). The analyses and tools described in this review provide guidelines to help NMR spectroscopists and computational chemists estimate the ranges of the NMR shifts for an unknown compound, identify intermediates in catalytic and other processes, analyze conformational aspects and intermolecular interactions, and predict trends in series of compounds throughout the Periodic Table. The present review provides a current snapshot of this important subﬁeld of NMR spectroscopy and a basis and framework for including future ﬁndings in the ﬁeld.},

Data obtained from nonhybrid as well as ﬁxed and rangeseparated hybrid functionals are compared. To allow for a chemically intuitive interpretation of the results, a breakdown of the EFGs of selected systems in terms of localized molecular orbitals is given. For CuF, CuCl, AuCl, UO22+, and a uranyl carbonate complex, the localized orbital decomposition demonstrates in particular the role of the valence metal d and f shells, respectively, and leads to rather compact analyses.

	abstract     = {A theoretical framework for understanding molecular structures is crucial for the development of new technologies such as catalysts or solar cells. Apart from electronic excitation energies, however, only spectroscopic properties of molecules consisting of lighter elements can be computationally described at a high level of theory today since heavy elements require a relativistic framework, and thus far, most methods have only been derived in a non-relativistic framework. Important new technologies such as those mentioned above require molecules that contain heavier elements, and hence, there is a great need for the development of relativistic computational methods at a higher level of accuracy. Here, the Second-Order-Polarization-Propagator-Approximation (SOPPA), which has proven to be very successful in the non-relativistic case, is adapted to a relativistic framework. The equations for SOPPA are presented in their most general form, i.e., in a non-canonical spin–orbital basis, which can be reduced to the canonical case, and the expressions needed for a relativistic four-component SOPPA are obtained. The equations are one-index transformed, giving more compact expressions that correspond to those already available for the four-component RPA. The equations are ready for implementation in a four-component quantum chemistry program, which will allow both linear response properties and excitation energies to be calculated relativistically at the SOPPA level.},

The approach follows a two-step state-interaction scheme: we ﬁrst compute zero-order states using nonrelativistic EOM-CC and then use these states to evaluate matrix elements of the spin−orbit and Zeeman operators. Diagonalization of the resulting Hamiltonian yields spin−orbit- and ﬁeld-perturbed eigenstates. Temperature- and ﬁeld-dependent magnetization and susceptibility are computed by numerical diﬀerentiation of the partition function. To compare with powder-sample experiments, these quantities are numerically averaged over ﬁeld orientations. We applied this protocol to several single-molecule magnets (SMMs) with Fe(II) and Fe(III) in trigonal pyramidal, linear, and trigonal bipyramidal coordination environments. We described the underlying electronic structure by the electron-attachment (EOM-EA) and spin-ﬂip (EOM-SF) variants of EOM-CC. The computed energy barriers for spin inversion, and macroscopic magnetization and susceptibility agree well with experimental data. Trends in magnetic anisotropy and spin-reversal energy barriers are explained in terms of a molecular orbital picture rigorously distilled from spinless transition density matrices between many-body states. The results illustrate excellent performances of EOMCC in describing magnetic behavior of mononuclear transition-metal SMMs.},

Exploiting a new development in the TURBOMOLE program package for computing vertical excitation energies and Faraday ) terms in an implicit solvent approximated by the conductor-like screening model (COSMO) at the CC2 level, we have investigated the solvent eﬀects on the relative positions of the ππ* and nπ* electronic transitions in these three molecules and compared them to the corresponding vacuum results. In the case of adenine, we also included speciﬁc solvent eﬀects with a small water cluster. The spectra obtained with the implicit model COSMO are in qualitative agreement with those obtained with explicit water molecules both with and without the inclusion of the bulk solvent eﬀects via the continuum solvent model. This suggests that the inclusion of the electrostatic contributions of the solvent can provide a suﬃciently accurate description of the absorption spectra for adenine. The results for purine, adenine, and guanine show that, after the inclusion of bulk solvation, the ππ* states shift to lower energies while at the same time nπ* states show a reversed behavior. The computed MCD spectra show the characteristic bisignate proﬁle found experimentally in all cases, despite, for adenine, remarkable diﬀerences in the origin of the individual peaks for diﬀerent computational methods. Therefore, the ability (or inability) of MCD to determine the relative stability of the La and Lb states is critically reassessed. According to our best estimate for adenine in aqueous solution, the La state is more stable than Lb.},

Specifically, in this article we extend, generalize and better formalize the concept of a domain-specific virtual processor as applied to scientific high-performance computing. In particular, we introduce a system-wide recursive (hierarchical) hardware encapsulation mechanism into the DSVP architecture and specify a concrete microarchitectural design of an abstract DSVP from which specialized DSVP implementations can be derived for specific scientific domains. Subsequently, we demonstrate, an example of a domain-specific virtual processor specialized to numerical tensor algebra workloads, which is implemented in the ExaTENSOR library developed by the author with a primary focus on the quantum many-body computational workloads on large-scale GPU-accelerated HPC platforms.},

The code is designed for parallel execution on many compute nodes with optional GPU coprocessing, accomplished via the new ExaTENSOR back end. The resulting ExaCorr module is primarily intended for calculations of molecules with one or more heavy elements, as relativistic eﬀects on the electronic structure are included from the outset. In the current work, we thereby focus on exact two-component methods and demonstrate the accuracy and performance of the software. The module can be used as a standalone program requiring a set of molecular orbital coeﬃcients as the starting point, but it is also interfaced to the DIRAC program that can be used to generate these. We therefore also brieﬂy discuss an improvement of the parallel computing aspects of the relativistic self-consistent ﬁeld algorithm of the DIRAC program.},

abstract = {{ Knowledge of the infrared transition moments of hydrogen halides, namely HF, HCl, HBr, and HI, is essential for atmospheric, astrophysical, and laser applications. Recently, a new polynomial empirical dipole moment function (DMF) for HCl has been constructed using an efficient approach that involves a direct fit of experimental ro-vibrational intensities [Li et al. J Quant Spectrosc Radiat Transfer 2011;112:1543–50]. In the present study, this method was extended to the use of Padé approximation representations of the DMF and applied to all four hydrogen halides. To carry out the fits, the best available experimental data were collected and critically evaluated. Combining dipole moment functions with the wavefunctions obtained from highly-accurate empirical potential energy curves, line intensities were computed numerically for numerous ro-vibrational bands, and compared with the experimental values and with intensities calculated using the most recent ab initio dipole moment functions. Results obtained in this work form basis for calculating intensities of spectral lines of hydrogen halides and their isotopologues in the HITRAN 2012 database.}},
