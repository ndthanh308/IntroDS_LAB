\section{Conclusion}

In this paper, we first present a generalization of the Weisfeiler-Lehman test algorithm from graphs to hypergraphs. To handle the complex neighbor relationships inherent in hypergraphs, we introduce a two-stage strategy that considers the vertex neighbors of a hyperedge and the hyperedge neighbors of a vertex. Based on this approach, we propose the Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman test algorithm as a solution to the hypergraph isomorphism problem.
Secondly, we propose a general hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel framework and implement two instances: Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman Subtree Kernel and Hypergraph Weisfiler-Lehman Hyperedge Kernel. We also provide theoretical evidence that, confronting the graph structure, when applied to graph structures, the proposed Hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman Kernel exhibits the same power as the conventional Graph Weisfeiler-Lehman Kernel. 
Lastly, we conduct experiments on seven graph classification datasets and twelve hypergraph classification datasets. The results showcase significant performance improvements, affirming the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
