\IEEEPARstart{N}{etwork}, as a typical irregular modeling tool, has shown its advances in many applications like social networks\cite{graph_social_network}, brain networks\cite{graph_brain}, collaborative networks\cite{graph_collabrative_network}, knowledge networks\cite{graph_knowledge_network}, chemical pathways\cite{graph_pathways}, and protein structures\cite{graph_protein}. However, real-world irregular data often comprise numerous high-order correlations that a simple graph structure cannot adequately represent. When attempting to model high-order correlations, such as the group relations in social media \cite{hg_social_media, hgnn, hgnnp} or the co-author relations in academic papers \cite{dhgnn, hg_coauthor, hg_encoder}, the intricate correlations among vertices become ambiguous, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:intro}. The hyperedge in hypergraphs can link more than two vertices, which endows the hypergraph with the capability to model beyond pair-wise correlation compared with the simple graph. To analyze and understand the hypergraph structure, one needs a tool to measure the similarity between different hypergraphs or sub-structures of a hypergraph, also known as the ``Isomorphism Test''.

%While graph isomorphism algorithms excel at extracting low-order structural information, they are limited in their ability to handle relationships beyond pair-to-pair connections. There exist many graph similarity measures based on graph isomorphisms like the Weisfeiler-Lehman test \cite{graph_wl} of graph isomorphism and graph kernels\cite{graph_wl_subtree, graph_wl_all, graphlet}.

Graph isomorphism algorithms, such as the Weisfeiler-Lehman test \cite{graph_wl} for graph isomorphism and graph kernels \cite{graph_wl_subtree, graph_wl_all, graphlet}, excel at extracting low-order structural information. However, they face limitations when dealing with relationships that extend beyond pair-to-pair connections. In the typical Weisfeiler-Lehman test, each vertex gathers its neighbor vertices' labels to generate the compressed vertex labels. Each compressed vertex label corresponds to a unique subtree structure. Nevertheless, the algorithm can only output whether the two graphs are identity. Furthermore, based on the algorithm, the graph kernel methods are proposed to measure the similarity of two graphs with a continuous value. The graph kernel methods design a mapping from the graph structure to the vector in the feature space and utilize the feature vector's inner product to measure the graphs' similarity. However, these graph-based similarity measurement methods, which rely on vertex-to-vertex label propagation, are not suitable for handling the complexity of such high-dimensional structures, as mentioned earlier in the case of hypergraphs.

With the emergence of hypergraph structures, researchers have also proposed various strategies \cite{hg_iso, hg_line, hg_root} to address the problem of high-order structure similarity measurement. However, most of these methods fundamentally rely on transforming hypergraphs into graph structures. These indirect hypergraph isomorphism algorithms, to some extent, sacrifice the complex structural information inherent in hypergraphs, leading to misalignments of criteria and cumbersome computational processes.
%Recently, researchers also proposed some strategies\cite{hg_iso, hg_line, hg_root} for the hypergraph similarity measure problem. Wachman et al.
\cite{hg_root} develop a sampling-based method that draws the vertex-hyperedge sequence from the original hypergraph. However, it will bring information loss and fail in many common cases (the pyramid-like hypergraphs in Figure \ref{fig:pyramid}).
By employing an indirect approach, Bai et al. \cite{hg_line} design a transformation-based method, which transforms the hypergraph structure into a low-order graph structure with three steps. In this way, the scale of the generated graph will be extremely large and can not be employed in practice (causing the out-of-memory error in the dataset containing more than 3000 hypergraphs in Table \ref{tab:hypergraph_real}). 


To address those problems, we first extend the Weisfier-Lehman test algorithm \cite{graph_wl} from graphs to hypergraphs. The definition of the neighbor relation is the obstacle to applying the Weisfiler-Lehman test in hypergraphs. Thus, as for the complex high-order correlations, we decompose the neighbor relation into two sub-neighbor relations: vertex's hyperedge neighbor and hyperedge's vertex neighbor. Then, based on the two neighbor relations, we devise a two-stage hypergraph Weisfiler-Lehman test algorithm, which can be directly applied to hypergraphs. Second, based on the hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman test algorithm, we proposed a general hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel, which maps the hypergraph structure into a vector in the feature space. With the hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel, the distance between two hypergraphs can be computed by the inner product of the two corresponding feature vectors. Third, we implement two instances of the general hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel: hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel and hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman hyperedge kernel. The hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel directly counts different types of subtree structures, and the hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman hyperedge kernel counts different  hyperedges. Besides, to deeply exploit the relation between the graph Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel and the proposed hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel, we have proven that the hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel can be reduced to the graph Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel when processing the graph structures from a mathematical perspective. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman kernels, we conduct experiments on $19$ graph/hypergraph classification datasets, including two synthetic graph datasets, five real-world graph datasets, four synthetic hypergraph datasets, and eight real-world hypergraph datasets. Experimental results on graph datasets demonstrate that the proposed hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel can achieve the same performance as the graph Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel (proven by Theorem \ref{theorem:equal}). Experimental results on hypergraph datasets show a superior performance increase compared with other kernel-based methods. We also conduct experiments to compare the runtime with other hypergraph methods, which is important in practice. Results demonstrate that our methods run faster and can achieve better performance. The main contributions of this paper are summarized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item We extend the Weisfeiler-Lehman test from graphs to hypergraphs and propose the hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman test algorithm for the hypergraph isomorphism test problem. % 提出框架，他是对现有图方法的一个拓展
    \item We propose a general hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman kernel framework for hypergraph or sub-structure hypergraph similarity measure and implement two instances: hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel and hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman hyperedge kernel.
    \item We mathematically prove that the proposed hypergraph Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel can degenerate into graph Weisfeiler-Lehman subtree kernel and achieve the same performance confronting graph structures. 
    \item Extensive experiments on $19$ graph/hypergraph classification datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.
