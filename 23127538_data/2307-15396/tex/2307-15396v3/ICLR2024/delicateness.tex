\section{Delicate behavior of linear splines} \label{sec:delicate}

%Analyzing the population loss of $\hat{h}_S$ in the intervals $[0,x_1],[x_n,1]$ requires considering the distribution of the spacings between data points. Let $\ell_0,\ldots,\ell_n$ be such that 
%\begin{equation} \label{eq:define_ell}
%    \forall i \in [n-1]\;\; \ell_i = x_{i+1}-x_i, \;\;\;\; \ell_0 = x_1, \;\;\;\; \ell_n = 1-x_n~.
%\end{equation}
%Prior works \citep{alagar1976distribution,pinelis2019order} established that  
%\begin{equation} %\label{eq:ell_distribution}
%    \left( \ell_0,\dots,\ell_n \right) \sim  \left( \frac{X_0}{X}, \dots, \frac{X_n}{X} \right), \text{ where } X_0,\dots,X_n \iid \text{Exp}(1), \text{ and } X:=\sum_{i=0}^{n} X_i~.
%\end{equation}
Recall the definition of $\hat{h}_S$ from \eqref{eq:hhat}.
$$ \hat{h}_S(x) := g_1(x) \cdot \mathbf{1}\{ x < x_1\} + g_{n-1}(x) \cdot \mathbf{1}\{x > x_{n}\}+ \hat{g}_S(x) \cdot \mathbf{1}\{x\in [x_{1},x_{n}]\}.$$
For simplicity, assume that $f^* \equiv 0$ and consider the $L_1$ loss.
Since in the interval $[0,x_1]$ the interpolator $\hat{h}_S$ is defined by extending the line connecting $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$, then it has slope of $\Theta\left(\frac{1}{\ell_1}\right)$, and hence the $L_1$ loss of $\hat{h}_S$ in $[0,x_1]$ is 
\[
    \Theta\left(\frac{\ell_0^2}{\ell_1}\right)
    = \Theta\left( \frac{X_0^2}{X \cdot X_1} \right)~, 
\]
as can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:splines-main_text} (right). Recall that $(X_0,\dots, X_n)$ and $X$ are defined in \eqref{eq:ell_distribution}. Since $X_1 \sim \text{Exp}(1)$, then $\Exp \left[\frac{1}{X_1} \right] = \infty$, and as a consequence the expected $L_1$ loss in $[0,x_1]$ is infinite. A similar argument also holds for the interval $[x_n,1]$. Thus, we get that $\Exp_S  \left[\mathcal{L}_p(\hat{h}_S)\right] = \infty$. However, with high probability the lengths $\ell_1$ and $\ell_{n-1}$ will not be too short, and therefore the loss in the intervals $[0,x_1]$ and $[x_n,1]$ will be bounded, which implies tempered overfitting with high probability.
