  "abstract": "We consider an extension of the Standard Model of particle physics with an additional $SU(2)$ gauge sector along with an additional scalar bidoublet and a non-linear sigma field. The neutral components of the bidoublet serve as dark matter candidates by virtue of the bidoublet being odd under a $Z_2$ symmetry. Generic beyond Standard Model constraints like vacuum stability, invisible decay of higgs, Higgs alignment limit and collider constraints on heavy gauge bosons restrict the parameter space of this model. In this multicomponent dark matter scenario, we investigate the interplay between the annihilation and co-annihilation channels originating from the new gauge sector as those contribute to the relic abundance. We also inspect the direct detection constraints on scattering cross-sections of the dark matter particles with the detector nucleons and present our observations.",
