  "abstract": "As deep learning models continue to advance and are increasingly utilized in real-world systems, the issue of robustness remains a major challenge. Existing certified training methods produce models that achieve high provable robustness guarantees at certain perturbation levels. However, the main problem of such models is a dramatically low standard accuracy, i.e. accuracy on clean unperturbed data, that makes them impractical. In this work, we consider a more realistic perspective of maximizing the robustness of a model at certain levels of (high) standard accuracy. To this end, we propose a novel certified training method based on a key insight that training with adaptive certified radii helps to improve both the accuracy and robustness of the model, advancing state-of-the-art accuracy-robustness tradeoffs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and TinyImageNet datasets. Particularly, on CIFAR-10 and TinyImageNet, our method yields models with up to two times higher robustness, measured as an average certified radius of a test set, at the same levels of standard accuracy compared to baseline approaches.",
