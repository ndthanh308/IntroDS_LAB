  "abstract": "In 2020, the LHCb collaboration reported the exclusive branching fractions for the channels $B_s^0 \\to D_s^{(*)-}μ^+ν_μ$ for the very first time. In view of these observations, we have recently reported the form factors and branching fraction computations for these channels employing the covariant confined quark model. As different other channels corresponding to $b \\to c \\ell ν_\\ell$ have provided the hint for New Physics, the analysis of observables such as forward-backward asymmetry, longitudinal and transverse polarizations across the lepton flavours can serve as one of the important probes for the search for possible New Physics. In present work, we compute these observables for all the lepton flavours and compare our predictions with the other theoretical approaches.",
