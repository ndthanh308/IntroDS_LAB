  "abstract": "We study, in a systematic way, the $V_{\\text{CKM}}$ unitarity relations which arise in extensions of the three generations Standard Model (3gSM) involving the addition of vector-like quarks (VLQ). In particular, we emphasize the effect of the presence of VLQ on $V_{\\text{CKM}}$ moduli differences, as well on the size of the imaginary parts of rephasing invariant $V_{\\text{CKM}}$ quartets. We consider the special case where an up-type VLQ is used to attempt at solving the unitarity problem in the first line of $V_{\\text{CKM}}$.",
