  "abstract": "We discuss how a standard scattering theory a of multi-particle theory generalises to systems based on Hamiltonians that involve higher-order derivatives in their quantum mechanical formulation. As concrete examples, we consider Hamiltonian systems built from higher-order charges of Calogero and Calogero-Moser systems. Exploiting the integrability of these systems, we compute the classical phase shifts and briefly comment on the quantum versions of these types of theories.",
