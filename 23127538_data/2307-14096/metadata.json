  "abstract": "We consider a general curvature equation $F(κ)=G(X,ν(X))$, where $κ$ is the principal curvature of the hypersurface $M$ with position vector $X$. It includes the classical prescribed curvature measures problem and area measures problem. However, Guan-Ren-Wang \\cite{GRW} proved that the $C^2$ estimate fails usually for general function $F$. Thus, in this paper, we pose some additional conditions of $G$ to get existence results by a suitably designed parabolic flow. In particular, if $F=σ_{k}^\\frac{1}{k}$ for $\\forall 1\\le k\\le n-1$, the existence result has been derived in the famous work \\cite{GLL} with $G=ψ(\\frac{X}{|X|})\\langle X,ν\\rangle^{\\frac1k}{|X|^{-\\frac{n+1}{k}}}$. This result will be generalized to $G=ψ(\\frac{X}{|X|})\\langle X,ν\\rangle^\\frac{1-p}{k}|X|^\\frac{q-k-1}{k}$ with $p>q$ for arbitrary $k$ by a suitable auxiliary function. The uniqueness of the solutions in some cases is also studied.",
