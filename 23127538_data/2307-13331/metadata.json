  "abstract": "The observation of room temperature ferromagnetism along with a low temperature paramagnetic counterpart in undoped Cu-Cu2O-rGO nanocomposite was demonstrated. A phenomenological approach was taken to explain the observations based on 3D Ising model for arbitrary spins generated due to Cu vacancy in the Cu2O system preferably at the interface.",
