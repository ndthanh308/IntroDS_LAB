	abstract = {Autonomous exploration is a complex task where the robot moves through an unknown environment with the goal of mapping it. The desired output of such a process is a sequence of paths that efficiently and safely minimise the uncertainty of the resulting map. However, optimising over the entire space of possible paths is computationally intractable. Therefore, most exploration methods relax the general problem by optimising a simpler one, for example finding the single next best view. In this work, we formulate exploration as a variational problem which allows us to directly optimise in the space of trajectories using functional gradient methods, searching for the Next Best Path (NBP). We take advantage of the recently introduced Hilbert maps to devise an information-based functional that can be computed in closed-form. The resulting trajectories are continuous and maximise safety as well as mutual information. In experiments we verify the ability of the proposed method to find smooth and safe paths and compare these results with other exploration methods.},

	abstract = {We consider an autonomous exploration problem in which a mobile robot is guided by an information-based controller through an a priori unknown environment, choosing to collect its next measurement at the location estimated to be most informative within its current field of view. We propose a novel approach to predict mutual information (MI) using Bayesian optimization. Over several iterations, candidate sensing actions are suggested by Bayesian optimization and added to a committee that repeatedly trains a Gaussian process (GP). The GP estimates MI throughout the robot's action space, serving as the basis for an acquisition function used to select the next candidate. The best sensing action in the committee is executed by the robot. This approach is compared over several environments with two batch methods, one which chooses the most informative action from a set of pseudo-random samples whose MI is explicitly evaluated, and one that applies GP regression to this sample set. Our computational results demonstrate that the proposed method provides not only computational efficiency and rapid map entropy reduction, but also robustness in comparison with competing approaches.},

	abstract = {The problem of active perception with an autonomous robot is studied in this paper. It is proposed that the exploratory behavior of the robot be controlled using mutual information (MI) surfaces between the current map and a one-step look ahead measurements. MI surfaces highlight informative areas for exploration. A novel method for computing these surfaces is described. An approach that exploits structural dependencies of the environment and handles sparse sensor measurements to build a continuous model of the environment, that can then be used to generate MI surfaces is also proposed. A gradient field of occupancy probability distribution is regressed from sensor data as a Gaussian Process and provide frontier boundaries for further exploration. The continuous global frontier surface completely describes unexplored regions and, inherently, provides an automatic termination criterion for a desired sensitivity. The results from publicly available datasets confirm an average improvement of the proposed methodology over comparable standard and state-of-the-art exploratory methods available in the literature by more than 20\% and 13\% in travel distance and map entropy reduction rate, respectively.},
