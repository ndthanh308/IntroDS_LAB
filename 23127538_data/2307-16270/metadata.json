  "abstract": "We discuss some aspects of our work on the mechanization of syntax and semantics in the UniMath library, based on the proof assistant Coq. We focus on experiences where Coq (as a type-theoretic proof assistant with decidable typechecking) made us use more theory or helped us to see theory more clearly.",
