  "abstract": "We study the problem of fairly allocating indivisible goods (positively valued items) and chores (negatively valued items) among agents with decreasing marginal utilities over items. Our focus is on instances where all the agents have simple preferences; specifically, we assume the marginal value of an item can be either $-1$, $0$ or some positive integer $c$. Under this assumption, we present an efficient algorithm to compute leximin allocations for a broad class of valuation functions we call order-neutral submodular valuations. Order-neutral submodular valuations strictly contain the well-studied class of additive valuations but are a strict subset of the class of submodular valuations. We show that these leximin allocations are Lorenz dominating and approximately proportional. We also show that, under further restriction to additive valuations, these leximin allocations are approximately envy-free and guarantee each agent their maxmin share. We complement this algorithmic result with a lower bound showing that the problem of computing leximin allocations is NP-hard when $c$ is a rational number.",
