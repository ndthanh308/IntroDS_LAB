  "abstract": "The engineering community currently encounters significant challenges in the development of intelligent transportation algorithms that can be transferred from simulation to reality with minimal effort. This can be achieved by robustifying the algorithms using domain adaptation methods and/or by adopting cutting-edge tools that help support this objective seamlessly. This work presents AutoDRIVE, an openly accessible digital twin ecosystem designed to facilitate synergistic development, simulation and deployment of cyber-physical solutions pertaining to autonomous driving technology; and focuses on bridging the autonomy-oriented simulation-to-reality (sim2real) gap using the proposed ecosystem. In this paper, we extensively explore the modeling and simulation aspects of the ecosystem and substantiate its efficacy by demonstrating the successful transition of two candidate autonomy algorithms from simulation to reality to help support our claims: (i) autonomous parking using probabilistic robotics approach; (ii) behavioral cloning using deep imitation learning. The outcomes of these case studies further strengthen the credibility of AutoDRIVE as an invaluable tool for advancing the state-of-the-art in autonomous driving technology.",
