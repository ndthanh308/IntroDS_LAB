title = {The Characteristics of Millisecond Pulsar Emission. I. Spectra, Pulse Shapes, and the Beaming Fraction},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {The extreme physical conditions in millisecond pulsar magnetospheres, as well as an evolutionary history that differs from that of normal pulsars, raise the question whether these objects also differ in their radio emission properties. We have monitored a large sample of millisecond pulsars for a period of 3 yr using the 100 m Effelsberg radio telescope in order to compare the radio emission properties of these two pulsar populations. Our sample comprises a homogeneous data set of very high quality. With some notable exceptions, our findings suggest that the two groups of objects share many common properties. A comparison of the spectral indices between samples of normal and millisecond pulsars demonstrates that millisecond pulsar spectra are not significantly different from those of normal pulsars. This is contrary to what has previously been thought. There is evidence, however, that millisecond pulsars are slightly less luminous and less efficient radio emitters than normal pulsars. We confirm recent suggestions that a diversity exists among the luminosities of millisecond pulsars, with the isolated millisecond pulsars being less luminous than the binary millisecond pulsars, implying that the different evolutionary history has an influence on the emission properties. There are indications that old millisecond pulsars exhibit somewhat flatter spectra than the presumably younger ones. We present evidence that, contrary to common belief, the millisecond pulsar profiles are only marginally more complex than those found among the normal pulsar population. Moreover, the development of the profiles with frequency is rather slow, suggesting very compact magnetospheres. The profile development seems to anticorrelate with the companion mass and the spin period, again suggesting that the amount of mass transfer in a binary system might directly influence the emission properties. The angular radius of radio beams of millisecond pulsars does not follow the scaling predicted from a canonical pulsar model applicable for normal pulsars. Instead, they are systematically smaller, supporting the concept of a critical rotational period below which such a scaling ceases to exist. The smaller inferred luminosity and narrower emission beams will need to be considered in future calculations of the birthrate of the Galactic population.}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {We present an algorithm for the simultaneous measurement of a pulse time-of-arrival (TOA) and dispersion measure (DM) from folded wideband pulsar data. We extend the prescription from Taylor's 1992 work to accommodate a general two-dimensional template “portrait,” the alignment of which can be used to measure a pulse phase and DM. We show that there is a dedispersion reference frequency that removes the covariance between these two quantities and note that the recovered pulse profile scaling amplitudes can provide useful information. We experiment with pulse modeling by using a Gaussian-component scheme that allows for independent component evolution with frequency, a “fiducial component,” and the inclusion of scattering. We showcase the algorithm using our publicly available code on three years of wideband data from the bright millisecond pulsar J1824−2452A (M28A) from the Green Bank Telescope, and a suite of Monte Carlo analyses validates the algorithm. By using a simple model portrait of M28A, we obtain DM trends comparable to those measured by more standard methods, with improved TOA and DM precisions by factors of a few. Measurements from our algorithm will yield precisions at least as good as those from traditional techniques, but is prone to fewer systematic effects and is without ad hoc parameters. A broad application of this new method for dispersion measure tracking with modern large-bandwidth observing systems should improve the timing residuals for pulsar timing array experiments, such as the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves.}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {While observations of many high-precision radio pulsars of order ≲1 μs across the sky are needed for the detection and characterization of a stochastic background of low-frequency gravitational waves (GWs), sensitivity to single sources of GWs requires even higher timing precision. The Argentine Institute of Radio Astronomy (IAR; Instituto Argentino de Radioastronomía) has begun observations of the brightest known millisecond pulsar, J0437−4715. Even though the two antennas are smaller than other single-dish telescopes previously used for pulsar timing array (PTA) science, the IAR’s capability to monitor this pulsar daily, coupled with the pulsar’s brightness, allows for high-precision measurements of pulse-arrival time. While upgrades of the facility are currently underway, we show that modest improvements beyond current plans will provide IAR with unparalleled sensitivity to this pulsar. The most stringent upper limits on single GW sources come from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav). Observations of PSR J0437−4715 will provide a significant sensitivity increase in NANOGrav’s “blind spot” in the sky where fewer pulsars are currently being observed. With state-of-the-art instrumentation installed, we estimate the array’s sensitivity will improve by a factor of ≈2–4 over 10 yr for 20\% of the sky with the inclusion of this pulsar, as compared to a static version of the PTA used in NANOGrav’s most recent limits. More modest instrumentation results in factors of ≈1.4–3. We identify four other candidate pulsars as suitable for inclusion in PTA efforts. International PTA efforts will also benefit from inclusion of these data, given the potential achievable sensitivity.}

abstract = {We derive scaling laws for the signal-to-noise ratio of the optimal cross-correlation statistic, and show that the large power-law increase of the signal-to-noise ratio as a function of the observation time T that is usually assumed holds only at early times. After enough time has elapsed, pulsar timing arrays enter a new regime where the signal to noise only scales as . In addition, in this regime the quality of the pulsar timing data and the cadence become relatively unimportant. This occurs because the lowest frequencies of the pulsar timing residuals become gravitational-wave dominated. Pulsar timing arrays enter this regime more quickly than one might naively suspect. For T = 10 yr observations and typical stochastic background amplitudes, pulsars with residual root-mean-squares of less than about 1 μs are already in that regime. The best strategy to increase the detectability of the background in this regime is to increase the number of pulsars in the array. We also perform realistic simulations of the NANOGrav pulsar timing array, which through an aggressive pulsar survey campaign adds new millisecond pulsars regularly to its array, and show that a detection is possible within a decade, and could occur as early as 2016.}

Our treatment applies exclusively to saturated scintillations of point sources in the strong scattering regime. We show how scintillation observations may be combined with other observables (proper motion and dispersion measure) to yield (1) improvements in galactic models for the free-electron density and (2) estimates of the distance and transverse velocity of individual pulsars. We explicitly consider cases of current astrophysical interest, including hypervelocity pulsars too far above the Galactic plane to allow distance estimates from dispersion measures alone. We also briefly consider scintillations of extragalactic sources, including gamma-ray burst sources at great distances from the Galaxy.}

This EPTA Data Release 1.0 extends up to mid-2014 and baselines range from 7–18 yr. It forms the basis for the stochastic gravitational-wave background, anisotropic background, and continuous-wave limits recently presented by the EPTA elsewhere. The Bayesian timing analysis performed with temponest yields the detection of several new parameters: seven parallaxes, nine proper motions and, in the case of six binary pulsars, an apparent change of the semimajor axis. We find the NE2001 Galactic electron density model to be a better match to our parallax distances (after correction from the Lutz–Kelker bias) than the M2 and M3 models by Schnitzeler. However, we measure an average uncertainty of 80 per cent (fractional) for NE2001, three times larger than what is typically assumed in the literature. We revisit the transverse velocity distribution for a set of 19 isolated and 57 binary MSPs and find no statistical difference between these two populations. We detect Shapiro delay in the timing residuals of PSRs J1600−3053 and J1918−0642, implying pulsar and companion masses \\$m\_\\{\\rm p\\}=1.22\_\\{-0.35\\}^\\{+0.5\\}\\ \\{\\rm M\\}\_\\{\\{\\odot \\}\\}\\$, \\$m\_\\{\\rm c\\} = 0.21\_\\{-0.04\\}^\\{+0.06\\}\\ \\{\\rm M\\}\_\\{\\{\\odot \\} \\}\\$ and \\$m\_\\{\\rm p\\}=1.25\_\\{-0.4\\}^\\{+0.6\\}\\ \\{\\rm M\\}\_\\{\\{\\odot \\}\\}\\$, \\$m\_\\{\\rm c\\} = 0.23\_\\{-0.05\\}^\\{+0.07\\}\\ \\{\\rm M\\}\_\\{\\{\\odot \\} \\}\\$, respectively. Finally, we use the measurement of the orbital period derivative to set a stringent constraint on the distance to PSRs J1012+5307 and J1909−3744, and set limits on the longitude of ascending node through the search of the annual-orbital parallax for PSRs J1600−3053 and J1909−3744.}",

A set of these boards have been employed to create 100-200 MHz, 50-100 channel spectrometers. Our applications involve detection of weak signals in a background of noise--pulsar radio astronomy and the search for narrow-band radio emissions from extraterrestrial civilizations. The agility factors include total bandwidth, spacing of filter channels, selection of filter response and choice of output data format (voltage or detected power). The input is a complex analog voltage centered on zero frequency which is passed to the board via coaxial ports on the front panel. The computational kernels on this board are Harris HSP 43168 Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter devices. We can also operate the board in a 16-channel output mode. The 2-4 bit format digital output is presented to a custom backplane. Along with our development we have written a suite of simulation software tasks both to determine the sensitivity loss and non-linear gain response that result from quantization and to optimize filter responses.}

    abstract = "{We present a robust approach to incorporating models for the time-variable broadening of the pulse profile due to scattering in the ionized interstellar medium into profile-domain pulsar timing analysis. We use this approach to simultaneously estimate temporal variations in both the dispersion measure (DM) and scattering, together with a model for the pulse profile that includes smooth evolution as a function of frequency, and the pulsar's timing model. We show that fixing the scattering time-scales when forming time-of-arrival estimates, as has been suggested in the context of traditional pulsar timing analysis, can significantly underestimate the uncertainties in both DM and the arrival time of the pulse, leading to bias in the timing parameters. We apply our method using a new, publicly available, GPU-accelerated code, both to simulations and observations of the millisecond pulsar PSR J1643−1224. This pulsar is known to exhibit significant scattering variability compared to typical millisecond pulsars, and we find including low-frequency (\\&lt;1 GHz) data without a model for these scattering variations leads to significant periodic structure in the DM, and also biases the astrometric parameters at the 4σ level, for example, changing proper motion in right ascension by 0.50 ± 0.12. If low-frequency observations are to be included when significant scattering variations are present, we conclude it is necessary to not just model those variations, but also to sample the parameters that describe the variations simultaneously with all other parameters in the model, a task for which profile domain pulsar timing is ideally suited.}",

abstract = {Pulsar timing has enabled some of the strongest tests of fundamental physics. Central to the technique is the assumption that the detected radio pulses can be used to accurately measure the rotation of the pulsar. Here, we report on a broadband variation in the pulse profile of the millisecond pulsar J1643−1224. A new component of emission suddenly appears in the pulse profile, decays over four months, and results in a permanently modified pulse shape. Profile variations such as these may be the origin of timing noise observed in other millisecond pulsars. The sensitivity of pulsar-timing observations to gravitational radiation can be increased by accounting for this variability.}

	abstract = {We present a study of the line-of-sight magnetic fields in five large-diameter Galactic H ii regions. Using the Faraday rotation of background polarized radio sources, as well as dust-corrected Hα surface brightness as a probe of electron density, we estimated the strength and orientation of the magnetic field along 93 individual sight lines through the H ii regions. Each of the H ii regions displayed a coherent magnetic field. The magnetic field strength (line-of-sight component) in the regions ranges from 2 to 6 μG, which is similar to the typical magnetic field strength in the diffuse interstellar medium. We investigated the relationship between magnetic field strength and electron density in the five H ii regions. The slope of magnetic field versus density in the low-density regime (0.8 cm−3 < ne <30 cm−3) is very slightly above zero. We also calculated the ratio of thermal to magnetic pressure, βth, for each data point, which fell in the range 1.01 < βth < 25. Finally, we studied the orientation of the magnetic field in the solar neighborhood (d < 1.1 kpc) using our data from five H ii regions along with existing measurements of the line-of-sight magnetic field strength from polarized pulsars whose distances have been determined from their annual parallax. We identify a net direction for the magnetic field in the solar neighborhood, but find no evidence for a preferred vertical direction of the magnetic field above or below the Galactic plane.}

The majority of the pulsars we observed have high to very high dispersion measures (DM \\&gt; 200) and our results confirm the suggestion of Löhmer et al. that the scatter time spectral indices for high-DM pulsars deviate from the value predicted by a single thin screen model with Kolmogorov's distribution of the density fluctuations. In this paper we discuss the possible explanations for such deviations.}",

abstract = {Interstellar scattering causes pulsar profiles to grow asymmetrically, thus affecting the pulsar timing residuals, and is strongest at lower frequencies. Different interstellar medium models predict different frequency (ν) and dispersion measure (DM) dependencies for the scattering timescale τsc. For Gaussian inhomogeneity the expected scaling relation is , while for a Kolmogorov distribution of irregularities, the expected relation is . Previous scattering studies showed a wide range of scattering index across all ranges of DM. A scattering index below 4 is believed to be either due to limitations of the underlying assumptions of the thin-screen model or an anisotropic scattering mechanism. We present a study of scattering for seven nearby pulsars (DM &lt; 50 pc cm−3) observed at low frequencies (10–88 MHz), using the first station of the Long Wavelength Array. We examine the scattering spectral index and DM variation over a period of about three years. The results yield insights into the small-scale structure of the interstellar medium, as well as the applicability of the thin-screen model for low-DM pulsars.}

    abstract = "{Recent studies have focused attention on the refractive effects of long-wavelength (≲ 1014 cm) electron density fluctuations in the interstellar medium upon radio observations of pulsars and compact extragalactic radio sources. In earlier work, a simple scattering model was introduced which allowed us to compute fluctuations in mean intensity, image size, pulse width and pulse arrival time, along with their cross-correlations and fluctuation time-scales, when there is a power-law spectrum of density perturbations in a thin ‘equivalent screen’ of scattering material. In this work, we extend the analysis to include refraction-induced fluctuations in intrinsically diffractive quantities such as the scintillation time-scale, ts, and the decorrelation bandwidth, νdc. We then use the theory to study the drifting bands in dynamic scintillation spectra caused by the dispersive steering of the diffraction pattern. We also estimate the fluctuations in the position of the image on the sky, rates of variation of intensity and position, and the root mean square elongation of the scatter-broadened image. We make two further extensions of the theory. First we show that, despite certain formal divergences, the theory can be extended to accommodate steeper density fluctuation spectra (power-law indices β\\&gt;4) than the conventionally assumed Kolmogorov spectrum (β=11/3). Secondly, we test the validity of the thin-screen approximation, developing a formalism to treat scattering in an extended medium. We find that the thin-screen theory sometimes underestimates the refractive fluctuations by a factor ∼2. The auto- and cross-correlations of the various observables are calculated and comparison is made with the known scintillation properties of pulsars to select those effects most suited to observational verification. The predicted cross-correlation between decorrelation bandwidth and flux fluctuations seems particularly suitable for this purpose. These measurements should, in turn, provide insights into the density fluctuation spectrum and the distribution of the scattering along the line-of-sight.}",
