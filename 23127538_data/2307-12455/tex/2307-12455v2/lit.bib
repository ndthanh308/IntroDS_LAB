Practical field simulations require however that robust and efficient decoupling techniques can be applied for solving these complex systems. In this work, we focus on the mechanics-step that involves the coupling of elasticity and the phase-field variable. We develop a multirate scheme in which a coarser time grid is employed for the mechanics equation (i.e., the displacements) and a finer time grid is taken for the phase-field problem. The performance of this algorithm is demonstrated for two test cases.}

The multirate coupling algorithm utilizes different time-scales of the flow and mechanics problems, by allowing for multiple finer time steps for flow within one coarse mechanics time step. When applied to production scenarios, the multirate scheme results in massive reductions in the number of mechanics linear iterations, without jeopardizing the accuracy of the obtained results. A number of numerical simulations substantiate our algorithmic developments.

These schemes are widely used in practice that follows a sequential procedure in which the flow and mechanics problems are fully decoupled. In such a scheme, the flow problem is solved first with time-lagging the displacement term followed by the mechanics solve. The multirate explicit coupling scheme exploits the different time scales for the mechanics and flow problems by taking multiple finer time steps for flow within one coarse mechanics time step. We provide fully discrete schemes for both the single and multirate approaches that use Backward Euler time discretization and mixed spaces for flow and conformal Galerkin for mechanics. We perform a rigorous stability analysis and derive the conditions on reservoir parameters and the number of finer flow solves to ensure stability for both schemes. Furthermore, we investigate the computational time savings for explicit coupling schemes against iterative coupling schemes.}

abstract = "In this work, we review and describe our computational framework for solving multiphysics phase-field fracture problems in porous media. Therein, the following five coupled nonlinear physical models are addressed: displacements (geo-mechanics), a phase-field variable to indicate the fracture position, a pressure equation (to describe flow), a proppant concentration equation, and/or a saturation equation for two-phase fracture flow, and finally a finite element crack width problem. The overall coupled problem is solved with a staggered solution approach, known in subsurface modeling as the fixed-stress iteration. A main focus is on physics-based discretizations. Galerkin finite elements are employed for the displacement-phase-field system and the crack width problem. Enriched Galerkin formulations are used for the pressure equation. Further enrichments using entropy-vanishing viscosity are employed for the proppant and/or saturation equations. A robust and efficient quasi-monolithic semi-smooth Newton solver, local mesh adaptivity, and parallel implementations allow for competitive timings in terms of the computational cost. Our framework can treat two- and three-dimensional realistic field and laboratory examples. The resulting program is an in-house code named IPACS (Integrated Phase-field Advanced Crack Propagation Simulator) and is based on the finite element library deal.II. Representative numerical examples are included in this document."

abstract = { We present a monolithic approach to large-deformation fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems that allows for choosing fully implicit, single-step and single-stage time integration schemes in the structure and fluid field independently, and hence is tailored to the needs of the individual field. The independent choice of time integration schemes is achieved by temporal consistent interpolation of the interface traction. To reduce computational costs, we introduce the possibility of field specific predictors in both structure and fluid field. These predictors act on the single fields only. Possible violations of the interface coupling conditions during the predictor step are dealt with within the monolithic solution procedure. We present full details of such a generalized monolithic solution procedure, which is fully consistent in its nonconforming temporal and spatial discretization. The incorporated mortar approach allows for nonmatching spatial discretizations of the fluid and solid domain at the fluid-structure interface and is fully integrated in the resulting monolithic system of equations. The method is applied to a variety of numerical examples. Thereby, temporal convergence rates, the special role of essential boundary conditions at the fluid-structure interface, and the positive effect of predictors are demonstrated and discussed. Emphasis is put on the comparison of different time integration schemes in fluid and structure field, for what the achieved freedom of choice of time integrators is fully exploited. }

The procedures developed are easily generalized to structural dynamics and a wide class of second-order hyperbolic problems."

abstract = {Abstract This report analyzes a multirate, decoupling algorithm, which allows different time steps in the fluid region and the porous region for the nonstationary Stokes–Darcy problem. The method presented requires only one, uncoupled Stokes and Darcy subphysics and subdomain solve per time step. Under a time step restriction of the form △t ≤ C (physical parameters) we prove stability and convergence of the method. Numerical tests are given to show the convergence result and demonstrate the computational efficiency of the partitioned method. They also show that in the expected case of greater fluid velocities in the free-flow region than in the porous media region, allowing smaller time steps in the subregion with the faster velocities increases both accuracy and efficiency. © 2012 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

abstract = {A mass conservative multirate time integration method is developed for a time-dependent isothermal single-phase free flow system coupled with an isothermal single-fluid-phase porous medium system. Long time stability of the proposed numerical scheme is proved under a time step restriction which depends on the physical parameters of the flow systems and the ratio between the time steps applied in the free flow and porous medium domains. Convergence analysis is carried out and a priori error estimates are obtained. Numerical results are presented for two model problems and a realistic setup. Advantages of using multiple-time-step techniques for modeling coupled systems where the processes evolve on different time scales are demonstrated and discussed.}

abstract = {Robust and accurate schemes are designed to simulate the coupling between subsurface and overland flows. The coupling conditions at the interface enforce the continuity of both the normal flux and the pressure. Richards’ equation governing the subsurface flow is discretized using a backward differentiation formula and a symmetric interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin method. The kinematic wave equation governing the overland flow is discretized using a Godunov scheme. Both schemes individually are mass conservative and can be used within single-step or multi-step coupling algorithms that ensure overall mass conservation owing to a specific design of the interface fluxes in the multi-step case. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the performances of the proposed algorithms.}

    abstract = {We present a monolithic geometric multigrid solver for fluid-structure interaction problems in Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian coordinates. The coupled dynamics of an incompressible fluid with nonlinear hyperelastic solids gives rise to very large and ill-conditioned systems of algebraic equations. Direct solvers usually are out of question because of memory limitations, and standard coupled iterative solvers are seriously affected by the bad condition number of the system matrices. The use of partitioned preconditioners in Krylov subspace iterations is an option, but the convergence will be limited by the outer partitioning. Our proposed solver is based on a Newton linearization of the fully monolithic system of equations, discretized by a Galerkin finite element method. Approximation of the linearized systems is based on a monolithic generalized minimal residual method iteration, preconditioned by a geometric multigrid solver. The special character of fluid-structure interactions is accounted for by a partitioned scheme within the multigrid smoother only. Here, fluid and solid field are segregated as Dirichlet–Neumann coupling. We demonstrate the efficiency of the multigrid iteration by analyzing 2d and 3d benchmark problems. While 2d problems are well manageable with available direct solvers, challenging 3d problems highly benefit from the resulting multigrid solver. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Multirate time stepping is a numerical technique for efficiently solving large-scale ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with widely different time scales localized over the components. This technique enables one to use large time steps for slowly varying components, and small steps for rapidly varying ones. Multirate methods found in the literature are normally of low order, one or two. Focusing on stiff ODEs, in this paper we discuss the construction of a multirate method based on the fourth-order RODAS method. Special attention is paid to the treatment of the refinement interfaces with regard to the choice of the interpolant and the occurrence of order reduction. For stiff, linear systems containing a stiff source term, we propose modifications for the treatment of the source term which overcome order reduction originating from such terms and which we can implement in our multirate method.}

The wide range of scales encountered lead to the problem that the fastest cell of the simulation dictates the global time step. Multirate time integration methods can be employed to alter the time step locally so that slower components take longer and fewer time steps, resulting in a moderate to substantial reduction of the computational cost, depending on the scenario to simulate [S. Osher, R. Sanders, Numerical approximations to nonlinear conservation laws with locally varying time and space grids, Math. Comput. 41 (1983) 321–336; H. Tang, G. Warnecke, A class of high resolution schemes for hyperbolic conservation laws and convection-diffusion equations with varying time and pace grids, SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 26 (4) (2005) 1415–1431; E. Constantinescu, A. Sandu, Multirate timestepping methods for hyperbolic conservation laws, SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 33 (3) (2007) 239–278]. In air pollution modeling the advection part is usually integrated explicitly in time, where the time step is constrained by a locally varying Courant–Friedrichs–Lewy (CFL) number. Multirate schemes are a useful tool to decouple different physical regions so that this constraint becomes a local instead of a global restriction. Therefore it is of major interest to apply multirate schemes to the advection equation. We introduce a generic recursive multirate Runge–Kutta scheme that can be easily adapted to an arbitrary number of refinement levels. It preserves the linear invariants of the system and is of third order accuracy when applied to certain explicit Runge–Kutta methods as base method.}
