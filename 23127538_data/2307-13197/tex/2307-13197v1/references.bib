               maintenance management systems (CMMS) represent an untapped
               opportunity to benchmark a facility?s maintenance and operation
               performance. However, it is challenging to carry out analytics
               on these large and amorphous databases. This paper puts forward
               a text-mining method to extract information about failure
               patterns in building systems and components from CMMS databases.
               The method is executed in three steps. Step 1 is pre-processing
               to convert work order descriptions into a mathematical form that
               lends itself to a quantitative lexical analysis. Step 2 is
               clustering to focus on interesting sections of a CMMS database
               that contain work orders about failures in building systems and
               components ? rather than less interesting routine maintenance
               and inspection activities. Step 3 is association rule-mining to
               identify the coexistence tendencies among the terms of cluster
               of interest (e.g. coexistence of the terms ?radiator? and
               ?leak?). This text-mining method is demonstrated by using two
               data sets. One data set was from a central heating and cooling
               plant with four boilers and five chillers; the other data set
               was from a cluster of 44 buildings. The results provide insights
               into per equipment breakdown of failure events, top system and
               component-level failure modes, and their occurrence frequencies.",

               environment control systems that aim to increase energy
               efficiency and occupant satisfaction in office buildings.
               Towards this goal, we present a new modeling approach of
               occupant interactions with a temperature control and energy use
               interface based on utility theory that reveals causal effects in
               the human decision-making process. The model is a utility
               function that quantifies occupants' preference over temperature
               setpoints incorporating their comfort and energy use
               considerations. We demonstrate our approach by implementing the
               user-interactive system in actual office spaces with an energy
               efficient model predictive HVAC controller. The results show
               that with the developed interactive system occupants achieved
               the same level of overall satisfaction with selected setpoints
               that are closer to temperatures determined by the
               model-predictive control (MPC) strategy to reduce energy use.
               Also, occupants often accept the default MPC setpoints when a
               significant improvement in the thermal environment conditions is
               not needed to satisfy their preference. Our results show that
               the HVAC energy consumption with MPC can be underestimated by up
               to 55\% without considering occupants' overrides. The prototype
               user-interactive system recovered 36\% of this additional energy
               consumption while achieving the same overall occupant
               satisfaction level. Based on these findings, we propose that the
               utility model can become a generalized approach to evaluate the
               design of similar user-interactive systems for different office
               layouts and building operation scenarios.",

               may provide deep insights into population behavior and
               health-related phenomena. However, there is limited knowledge
               about its potential uses and limitations. We therefore
               systematically reviewed health care literature using Google
               Trends to classify articles by topic and study aim; evaluate the
               methodology and validation of the tool; and address limitations
               for its use in research. METHODS AND FINDINGS: PRISMA guidelines
               were followed. Two independent reviewers systematically
               identified studies utilizing Google Trends for health care
               research from MEDLINE and PubMed. Seventy studies met our
               inclusion criteria. Google Trends publications increased
               seven-fold from 2009 to 2013. Studies were classified into four
               topic domains: infectious disease (27\% of articles), mental
               health and substance use (24\%), other non-communicable diseases
               (16\%), and general population behavior (33\%). By use, 27\% of
               articles utilized Google Trends for casual inference, 39\% for
               description, and 34\% for surveillance. Among surveillance
               studies, 92\% were validated against a reference standard data
               source, and 80\% of studies using correlation had a correlation
               statistic $\geq$0.70. Overall, 67\% of articles provided a
               rationale for their search input. However, only 7\% of articles
               were reproducible based on complete documentation of search
               strategy. We present a checklist to facilitate appropriate
               methodological documentation for future studies. A limitation of
               the study is the challenge of classifying heterogeneous studies
               utilizing a novel data source. CONCLUSION: Google Trends is
               being used to study health phenomena in a variety of topic
               domains in myriad ways. However, poor documentation of methods
               precludes the reproducibility of the findings. Such

               consistency of results provided by Google Trends for a
               well-specified query over time. Furthermore, greater
               transparency can improve its reliability as a research tool.",

               are acquired by efficiently combining subjective weights,

              prediction models of building thermal load are constrained by the
              model and input complexity. In this study, we developed 12
              data-driven models (7 shallow learning, 2 deep learning, and 3
              heuristic methods) to predict building thermal load and compared
              shallow machine learning and deep learning. The 12 prediction
              models were compared with the measured cooling demand. It was
              found XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boost) and LSTM (Long Short Term
              Memory) provided the most accurate load prediction in the shallow
              and deep learning category, and both outperformed the best
              baseline model, which uses the previous day's data for
              prediction. Then, we discussed how the prediction horizon and
              input uncertainty would influence the load prediction accuracy.
              Major conclusions are twofold: first, LSTM performs well in
              short-term prediction (1 h ahead) but not in long term prediction
              (24 h ahead), because the sequential information becomes less
              relevant and accordingly not so useful when the prediction
              horizon is long. Second, the presence of weather forecast
              uncertainty deteriorates XGBoost's accuracy and favors LSTM,
              because the sequential information makes the model more robust to
              input uncertainty. Training the model with the uncertain rather
              than accurate weather data could enhance the model's robustness.
              Our findings have two implications for practice. First, LSTM is
              recommended for short-term load prediction given that weather
              forecast uncertainty is unavoidable. Second, XGBoost is
              recommended for long term prediction, and the model should be
              trained with the presence of input uncertainty.",

  abstract = "Bayesian calibration as proposed by Kennedy and O'Hagan [22] has
              been increasingly applied to building energy models due to its
              ability to account for the discrepancy between observed values
              and model predictions. However, its application has been limited
              to calibration using monthly aggregated data because it is
              computationally inefficient when the dataset is large. This study
              focuses on improvements to the current implementation of Bayesian
              calibration to building energy simulation. This is achieved by:
              (1) using information theory to select a representative subset of
              the entire dataset for the calibration, and (2) using a more
              effective Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm, the
              No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), which is an extension of Hamiltonian
              Monte Carlo (HMC) to explore the posterior distribution. The
              calibrated model was assessed by evaluating both accuracy and
              convergence. Application of the proposed method is demonstrated
              using two cases studies: (1) a TRNSYS model of a water-cooled
              chiller in a mixed-use building in Singapore, and (2) an
              EnergyPlus model of the cooling system of an office building in
              Pennsylvania, U.S.A. In both case studies, convergence was
              achieved for all parameters of the posterior distribution, with

              also energy flexible to facilitate reliable integration of
              intermittent renewable energy sources into smart grids.
              Estimating the aggregate energy-flexibility potential at a
              cluster level plays a key role in assessing financial benefits
              and service area for energy-flexibility services at design stage
              and determining real-time pricings at operating stage. However,
              most existing studies focused on the energy flexibility of
              individual buildings rather than building clusters. In addition,
              due to the intrinsic uncertainty in building envelope parameters,
              performance of building energy systems, and occupancy and
              occupant behavior, it is necessary to quantify the uncertainty in
              aggregate energy flexibility. In this study, we developed an
              approach to quantifying the uncertainty in the aggregate energy
              flexibility of residential building clusters using a data-driven
              stochastic occupancy model that can capture the stochasticity of
              occupancy patterns. A questionnaire survey was carried out to
              collect occupancy time-series data in Hong Kong for occupancy
              model identification. Aggregation analysis was conducted
              considering various building archetypes and occupancy patterns.
              The uncertainty in aggregate energy flexibility was then
              quantified based on the proposed performance indices using Monte
              Carlo technique. With the scaling up of building clusters, the
              estimated energy-flexibility potential became steady and the
              weekly energy flexibility stayed around 12.40\%. However, the
              weekly uncertainty of aggregated energy flexibility exponentially
              decreased from 19.12\% for 8 households to 0.74\% for 5120
              households, which means that the estimate of a building cluster's
              energy flexibility is more reliable than that of a single
              building.",

              this paper, we introduce DayFilter, a day-typing process that
              uses Symbolic Aggregate approXimation (SAX), motif and discord
              extraction, and clustering to detect the underlying structure of
              building performance data. Discords, or infrequent daily
              patterns, are filtered and tagged for deeper, detailed analysis
              of potential energy savings opportunities. Motifs, or the most
              frequent patterns, are detected and further aggregated using
              k-means clustering. This procedure is designed for application on
              whole building and sub-system metrics from hierarchical building

              quantitative raw data into qualitative subgroups based on daily

              techniques. We apply DayFilter on 474days of example data from an
              international school campus in a tropical climate and 407days of
              data from an office building from a temperate European climate.

              less than one day. A class of univariate methods that has

              These methods include several exponential smoothing formulations,

  abstract  = "The world is rapidly urbanizing, and the energy intensive built
               environment is becoming increasingly responsible for the world's
               energy consumption and associated environmental emissions. As a
               result, significant efforts have been put forth to develop
               methods that can accurately model and characterize building
               energy consumption in cities. These models aim to utilize
               physics-based building energy simulations, reduced-order
               calculations and statistical learning methods to assess the
               energy performance of buildings within a dense urban area.
               However, current urban building energy models are limited in
               their ability to account for the inter-building energy dynamics
               and urban microclimate factors that can have a substantial
               impact on building energy use. To overcome these limitations,
               this paper proposes a novel Data-driven Urban Energy Simulation
               (DUE-S) framework that integrates a network-based machine
               learning algorithm (ResNet) with engineering simulation to
               better understand how buildings consume energy on multiple
               temporal (hourly, daily, monthly) and spatial scales in a city
               (single building, block, urban). We validate the proposed DUE-S
               framework on a proof of concept case study of 22 densely located
               university buildings in California, USA. Our results indicate
               that the DUE-S framework is able to accurately predict urban
               scale energy consumption at hourly, daily and monthly intervals.
               Moreover, our results also demonstrate that the integration of
               data-driven and engineering simulation approaches can partially
               capture the inter-building energy dynamics and impacts of the
               urban context and merits future work to explore how they can be
               improved to predict sub-urban scale energy predictions (single
               building, block). In the end, successfully predicting and
               modeling the energy performance of urban buildings has the
               potential to inform the decision-making of a wide variety of
               urban sustainability stakeholders including architects,
               engineers and policymakers.",

               different spatial resolution of occupancy data on the gap
               between predicted and measured energy use in buildings. The
               study also examines the effect of occupancy data on the quality
               of the constructed prediction intervals (PIs) using the Coverage
               Width-based Criterion (CWC) metric. CWC evaluates the PIs based
               on both their coverage (correctness) and width
               (informativeness). This investigation takes the form of an
               actual building case study, with nine months of hourly measured
               building electricity use, WiFi connection counts as a proxy for
               occupancy, and actual weather data. In general, the building
               energy model's accuracy improves with the occupancy and
               plug-loads schedule derived from WiFi data. Specifically, the
               Coefficient of Variation Root Mean Square Error (CV[RMSE])
               reduced from 37\% to 24\% with an exponential improvement in the
               PIs quality compared to the results obtained with ASHRAE 90.1
               reference schedules. However, the increase in prediction
               accuracy shrank to 5\% CV(RMSE) and a comparable CWC upon
               calibrating the base loads of the reference schedules.
               Increasing the spatial resolution from building aggregated to
               floor aggregated occupancy data worsened the CV(RMSE) and CWC,
               suggesting trade-offs between parameter uncertainty and model
               bias/inadequacy. These results contribute to our understanding

               objectives, and data informativeness, facilitating future

  abstract = "Building occupants are often assumed to follow deterministic
              schedules in building performance simulation programs. Therefore,
              to accurately capture the dynamic nature of the occupants'
              movement patterns, researchers have proposed various indoor
              localisation technologies to infer occupancy information with
              varying degrees of accuracy and resolution. Among these
              technologies, the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) technology emerged
              as a popular alternative due to its availability in smartphone
              devices, as well as its low cost and power demand. In this study,
              we proposed a scalable and less intrusive occupancy detection
              method that leverages existing BLE technologies found in
              smartphone devices to perform zone-level occupancy localisation,
              without the need for a mobile application. The proposed method
              uses a network of BLE beacons for data collection before passing
              the pre-processed data into a machine learning model to infer the
              occupants' zone-level location. A supervised ensemble model and a
              semi-supervised clustering model were proposed and evaluated to
              identify the best performing model. The feasibility of the
              proposed method is demonstrated during a five-week case study
              involving two office spaces in an academic building in Singapore.
              While the supervised ensemble model produced the best performance
              in terms of accuracy and macro-average f1-score, the
              semi-supervised model was able to produce a reasonable
              performance while using a fraction of the training data (<4\%)
              and time needed by the supervised model. By analysing the
              occupancy information obtained through the best performing model,
              we further identified a set of occupancy profiles to represent

               subjective feedback of comfort-based preference using micro
               ecological momentary assessments on a smartwatch platform. An
               experiment with 30 occupants over two weeks produced 4378
               field-based surveys for thermal, noise, and acoustic preference.
               The occupants and the spaces in which they left feedback were
               then clustered according to these preference tendencies. These

               use in a multi-class classification task. These classification

               heart rate, and the historical preferences of both the

              including spatial distribution and temporal variations are of
              great importance to delivering energy efficient and productive
              buildings. An experimental study comprising 24-h monitoring over
              30 full days was conducted in a university library building.
              Occupancy profiles have been monitored and analysis has been
              carried out. Central to this monitoring study is the Wi-Fi based
              indoor positioning system based on the measured Wi-Fi devices'
              number and locations and data mining methods. Distinct from
              traditional occupancy and energy studies, more detailed
              information related to the indoor positions and number of
              occupants has offered a better understanding of building user
              behaviour. The implication of the occupancy patterns for energy
              (e.g. lighting and other building services) efficiency is
              assessed, assisted with data from lighting sensors where needed.
              It is found occupancy patterns change dramatically with time.
              Also, the energy waste patterns have been identified through the
              method of data association rule mining. If the identified energy
              waste is removed, the total energy consumption can be reduced by
              26.1\%. The indoor positioning information also has implications
              for optimizing space use, opening hours as well as staff
              deployment. The work could be extended to more rooms with diverse
              functions, other seasons and other types of non-domestic
              buildings for a more comprehensive understanding of building user
              behaviour and energy efficiency.",

              gas emissions in the building sector is essential for meeting our
              future sustainability goals. Recently, smart energy metering
              facilities have been deployed to enable monitoring of energy
              consumption data with hourly or subhourly temporal resolution.
              This unprecedented data collection has created various
              opportunities for advanced data analytics involving load profiles
              (e.g., building energy benchmarking programs, building-to-grid
              integration, and calibration of urban-scale energy models). These
              applications often need preprocessing steps to detect daily load
              profile discords, such as: 1) outliers due to system malfunctions
              (the bad) and 2) irregular energy consumption patterns, such as
              those resulting from holidays (the ugly) compared to normal
              consumption patterns (the good). However, current preprocessing
              methods predominantly focus on filtering using statistical
              threshold values, which fail to capture the contextual discords
              of daily profiles. In addition, discord detection algorithms in
              building research are often aimed at finding individual
              building-level discords, which are not suitable at a large scale.
              Thus, in this paper, we develop a method for automated load
              profile discord identification (ALDI) in a large portfolio of
              buildings (more than 100 buildings). Specifically, ALDI 1) uses
              the matrix profile (MP) method to quantify the similarities of
              daily subsequences in time series meter data, 2) compares daily
              MP values with typical-day MP distributions using the
              Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, and 3) identifies daily load profile
              discords in a large building portfolio. We evaluate ALDI using
              the metering data of both an academic campus and a residential
              neighborhood. Our results demonstrate that ALDI efficiently
              discovers measurement errors by system malfunctions and low
              energy consumption days in the academic campus portfolio, and it
              detects unique load shape patterns likely driven by occupant
              behavior and extreme weather conditions in the residential
              neighborhood.",

              During the past decades, a wide variety of studies have been
              conducted throughout the building lifecycle for improving the

              adopted owing to less detailed building information required and
              high computational efficiency for online applications. Recent
              advances in information technologies and data science have
              enabled convenient access, storage, and analysis of massive
              on-site measurements, bringing about a new big-data-driven
              research paradigm. This paper presents a critical review of
              data-driven methods, particularly those methods based on larger
              datasets, for building energy modeling and their practical
              applications for improving building performances. This paper is
              organized based on the four essential phases of big-data-driven
              modeling, i.e., data preprocessing, model development, knowledge
              post-processing, and practical applications throughout the

              have been summarized and compared at each stage, based upon which
              in-depth discussions and future research directions have been
              presented. This review demonstrates that the insights obtained
              from big building data can be extremely helpful for enriching the
              existing knowledge repository regarding building energy modeling.

              facilitate their city's transition to a low-carbon future. In
              this paper, a new Augmented-Urban Building Energy Model (A-UBEM)
              is proposed that combines data-driven and physics-based
              simulation methods to produce synthetic hourly load curve
              estimates for every building within a city---similar to data an
              hourly smart meter would measure. By using only publicly
              available data, a generalizable two-step process is
              implemented---that other cities with similar available data can
              replicate---using New York City as a case study. Step (1)
              estimates the annual energy use for every building in the city
              using supervised machine learning algorithms. Step (2) extends
              these results and leverages physics-based simulation models
              through a convex optimization formulation that minimizes the
              squared difference between the aggregated building demand and the
              observed city-wide hourly electricity demand. Results from step
              (1) show that the Random Forest algorithm performs best with a
              mean log squared error of 0.293, while the convex optimization in
              step (2) results in a mean training error of 6.11\% mean absolute
              percentage error (MAPE). To validate the stability of the
              produced load curves, Monte Carlo simulations are conducted,
              using random subsets of buildings from the city, which produce an
              out-of-sample error averaging 6.41\% MAPE across each simulation.
              Particle swarm optimization is also explored---using the results
              from the Monte Carlo simulation---to assess if the model could be
              improved by relaxing certain constraints, but marginal error
              reductions are found, further proving the stability of the
              proposed model. Overall, A-UBEM is a first step towards creating
              highly granular urban-scale synthetic hourly load curves solely
              using open data. Such load curves are integral for planning
              sustainable cities and accelerating the adoption of low-carbon

  abstract = "The surge in interval meter data availability and associated
              activity in energy data analytics has inspired new interest in
              advanced methods for building efficiency savings estimation.
              Statistical and machine learning approaches are being explored to
              improve the energy baseline models used to measure and verify
              savings. One outstanding challenge is the ability to identify and
              account for operational changes that may confound savings
              estimates. In the measurement and verification (M\&V) context,
              `non-routine events' (NREs) cause changes in building energy use
              that are not attributable to installed efficiency measures, and
              not accounted for in the baseline model's independent variables.
              In the M\&V process NREs must be accounted for as `adjustments'
              to appropriately attribute the estimated energy savings to the
              specific efficiency interventions that were implemented.
              Currently this is a manual and custom process, conducted using
              professional judgment and engineering expertise. As such it
              remains a barrier in scaling and standardizing meter-based
              savings estimation. In this work, a data driven methodology was
              developed to (partially) automate, and therefore streamline the
              process of detecting NREs in the post-retrofit period and making
              associated savings adjustments. The proposed NRE detection
              algorithm is based on a statistical change point detection method
              and a dissimilarity metric. The dissimilarity metric measures the
              proximity between the actual time series of the post-retrofit
              energy consumption and the projected baseline, which is generated
              using a statistical baseline model. The suggested approach for
              NRE adjustment involves the NRE detection algorithm, the M\&V
              practitioner, and a regression modeling algorithm. The
              performance of the detection and adjustment algorithm was
              evaluated using a simulation-generated test data set, and two
              benchmark algorithms. Results show a high true positive detection
              rate (75\%-100\% across the test cases), higher than ideal false
              positive detection rates (20\%-70\%), and low errors in energy
              adjustment (<0.7\%). These results indicate that the algorithm
              holds for helping M\&V practitioners to streamline the process of
              handling NREs. Moreover, the change point algorithm and
              underlying statistical principles could prove valuable for other
              building analytics applications such as anomaly detection and
              fault diagnostics.",

              building occupancy, although the shapes of the schedules are
              generally similar. The use of standard schedules could therefore,
              have significant impacts on district-scale energy demand
              simulations, as the overestimation will be cumulative. As
              compared to the differences between data-driven and standard
              schedules, the differences between different locations are
              significantly smaller. However in extreme cases, the weekly
              cumulative occupancy and the number of occupied hours differ by
              more than 30\% between locations, which means that
              context-specific differences together with climatic differences
              might also impact building performance simulation results.
              Furthermore, we found differences in daily data between the
              different days of the week. In particular, the observed behavior
              on Fridays is significantly different from other weekdays for
              both considered use-types. This indicates that the conventional
              categorization of occupant behavior models into three day-types:
              weekday, Saturday, and Sunday, should be reconsidered.",

              the forefront of analysis of large temporal sensor data from the

              engineered from the whole building hourly electrical meter data
              from 507 non-residential buildings. These features fall within
              the three general categories of statistics, model, and
              pattern-based and can be used to identify various behavior in the
              structure of the whole building electrical meter data. In this
              paper, a deeper investigation is made of exactly what types of
              behavior are most important in the context of two classification
              scenarios: the primary use of a building and the level of
              performance the building has when compared to its peers. The
              highly comparative time-series analysis (hctsa) toolkit is used
              to analyze the most important temporal features for the
              classification of various building performance attributes. In the
              first analysis, a comparison is made to distinguish the behavior
              between university dormitories (70 buildings) and laboratories
              (95 buildings) as an example of interpreting the classification
              of the primary-use-type of a building. In the second analysis, a
              comparison of buildings with high (165 buildings) versus low (169
              buildings) consumption is used to extract and understand the

              further explainable machine learning techniques in both
              classification and prediction as applied to buildings. This

  abstract = "Many energy performance analysis methodologies assign buildings a
              descriptive label that represents their main activity, often
              known as the primary space usage (PSU). This attribute comes from
              the intent of the design team based on assumptions of how the
              majority of the spaces in the building will be used. In reality,
              the way a building's occupants use the spaces can be different
              than what was intended. With the recent growth of hourly
              electricity meter data from the built environment, there is the
              opportunity to create unsupervised methods to analyze electricity
              consumption behavior to understand whether the PSU assigned is
              accurate. Misclassification or oversimplification of the use of
              the building is possible using these labels when applied to
              simulation inputs or benchmarking processes. To work towards
              accurate characterization of a building's utilization, we propose
              a modular methodology for identifying potentially mislabeled
              buildings using distance-based clustering analysis based on
              hourly electricity consumption data. This method seeks to segment
              buildings according to their daily behavior and predict which
              ones are misfits according to their assigned PSU label. This
              process finds potentially uncharacteristic behavior that could be
              an indication of mixed-use or a misclassified PSU. Our results on
              two public data sets, from the Building Data Genome (BDG) Project
              and Washington DC (DGS), with 507 and 322 buildings respectively,
              show that 26\% and 33\% of these buildings are potentially
              mislabelled based on their load shape behavior. Such information
              provides a more realistic insight into their true consumption
              characteristics, enabling more accurate simulation scenarios.

              program investments and their ability to defer supply-side
              capital investments. Today's methods for measurement and
              verification (M\&V) of energy savings constitute a significant
              portion of the total costs of energy efficiency programs. They
              also require time-consuming data acquisition. A spectrum of
              savings calculation approaches is used, with some relying more
              heavily on measured data and others relying more heavily on
              estimated, modeled, or stipulated data. The increasing
              availability of ``smart'' meters and devices that report
              near-real time data, combined with new analytical approaches to
              quantify savings, offers the potential to conduct M\&V more
              quickly and at lower cost, with comparable or improved accuracy.
              Commercial energy management and information systems (EMIS)
              technologies are beginning to offer these `M\&V 2.0′
              capabilities, and program administrators want to understand how
              they might assist programs in quickly and accurately measuring
              energy savings. This paper presents the results of recent testing
              of the ability to use automation to streamline the M\&V process.
              In this paper, we apply an automated whole-building M\&V tool to
              historic data sets from energy efficiency programs to begin to
              explore the accuracy, cost, and time trade-offs between more
              traditional M\&V, and these emerging streamlined methods that use
              high-resolution energy data and automated computational
              intelligence. For the data sets studied we evaluate the fraction
              of buildings that are well suited to automated baseline
              characterization, the uncertainty in gross savings that is due to
              M\&V 2.0 tools' model error, and indications of labor time
              savings, and how the automated savings results compare to prior,
              traditionally determined savings results. The results show that
              70\% of the buildings were well suited to the automated approach.
              In a majority of the cases (80\%) savings and uncertainties for
              each individual building were quantified to levels above the
              criteria in ASHRAE Guideline 14. In addition the findings suggest
              that M\&V 2.0 methods may also offer time-savings relative to
              traditional approaches. Finally we discuss the implications of
              these findings relative to the potential evolution of M\&V, and
              pilots currently being launched to test how M\&V automation can
              be integrated into ratepayer-funded programs and professional
              implementation and evaluation practice.",

              to predict the energy use as a function of time during the

              compared to the actual energy use, and errors are summarized with
              several metrics, including bias and mean absolute percent error

              be used to assess the predictive accuracy of a model even if the

              proprietary tools can be evaluated while protecting the

               measurement and verification procedures. Hundreds of building
               energy prediction techniques have been developed over the last
               three decades, yet there is still no consensus on which
               techniques are the most effective for various building types. In
               addition, many of the techniques developed are not publicly
               available to the general research community. This paper outlines
               a library of open-source regression techniques from the
               Scikit-Learn Python library and describes the process of
               applying them to open hourly electrical meter data from 482
               non-residential buildings from the Building Data Genome Project.
               The results illustrate that there are several techniques,
               notably decision tree-based models, that perform well on
               two-thirds of the total cohort of buildings. However, over
               one-third of the buildings, specifically primary schools,
               performed poorly. This example implementation shows that there
               is no one size-fits-all modeling solution and that various types
               of temporal behavior are difficult to capture using machine
               learning. An analysis of the generalizability of the models
               tested motivates the need for the application of future
               techniques to a board range of building types and behaviors. The

              increasing, with the majority of this increase occurring in a

              respond quickly to increasing visitor-related challenges.
              Improved visitation forecasting would allow managers to more
              proactively plan for such increases. In this study, we leverage
              internet search data that is freely available through Google
              Trends to create a forecasting model. We compare this Google
              Trends model to a traditional autoregressive forecasting model.
              Overall, our Google Trends model accurately predicted 97\% of the
              total visitation variation to all parks one year in advance from
              2013 to 2017 and outperformed the autoregressive model by all
              metrics. While our Google Trends model performs better overall,
              this was not the case for each park unit individually; the
              accuracy of this model varied significantly from park to park. We
              hypothesized that park attributes related to trip planning would
              correlate with the accuracy of our Google Trends model, but none
              of the variables tested produced overly compelling results.
              Future research can continue exploring the utility of Google

              non-seasonal influenza outbreaks remains a great challenge.
              Previous internet-based surveillance studies built purely on
              internet or climate data do have potential error. METHODS: We
              collected influenza notifications, temperature and Google Trends
              (GT) data between January 1st, 2011 and December 31st, 2016. We
              performed time-series cross correlation analysis and temporal
              risk analysis to discover the characteristics of influenza
              epidemics in the period. Then, the seasonal autoregressive
              integrated moving average (SARIMA) model and regression tree
              model were developed to track influenza epidemics using GT and
              climate data. RESULTS: Influenza infection was significantly
              corrected with GT at lag of 1-7 weeks in Brisbane and Gold Coast,
              and temperature at lag of 1-10 weeks for the two study settings.
              SARIMA models with GT and temperature data had better predictive
              performance. We identified autoregression (AR) for influenza was
              the most important determinant for influenza occurrence in both
              Brisbane and Gold Coast. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggested
              internet search metrics in conjunction with temperature can be
              used to predict influenza outbreaks, which can be considered as a
              pre-requisite for constructing early warning systems using search

              globe are facing due to the Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
              pandemic, which has also had severe socioeconomic consequences,
              it is imperative to explore novel approaches to monitoring and
              forecasting regional outbreaks as they happen or even before they
              do so. To that end, in this paper, the role of Google query data
              in the predictability of COVID-19 in the United States at both
              national and state level is presented. As a preliminary
              investigation, Pearson and Kendall rank correlations are examined
              to explore the relationship between Google Trends data and
              COVID-19 data on cases and deaths. Next, a COVID-19
              predictability analysis is performed, with the employed model
              being a quantile regression that is bias corrected via bootstrap
              simulation, i.e., a robust regression analysis that is the
              appropriate statistical approach to taking against the presence
              of outliers in the sample while also mitigating small sample
              estimation bias. The results indicate that there are
              statistically significant correlations between Google Trends and
              COVID-19 data, while the estimated models exhibit strong COVID-19

              that online real-time data are valuable in the monitoring and
              forecasting of epidemics and outbreaks, it is evident that such

The acquisition of labelled data however remains a challenge. This paper presents a methodology for the collection of in-situ occupant feedback data using a Fitbit smartwatch. The clock-face application cozie can be downloaded free-of-charge on the Fitbit store and tailored to fit a range of occupant comfort related experiments. In the initial trial of the app, fifteen users were given a smartwatch for one month and were prompted to give feedback on their thermal preferences. In one month, with minimal administrative overhead, 1460 labelled responses were collected. This paper demonstrates how these large data sets of human feedback can be analysed to reveal a range of results from building anomalies, occupant behaviour, occupant personality clustering, and general feedback related to the building. The paper also discusses limitations in the approach and the next phase of design of the platform.}

These techniques have occupants giving subjective feedback using smartphones or smartwatches frequently over the course of days or weeks. The intention is that the data will be collected with high spatial and temporal diversity to best characterize a building and the occupant’s preferences. But in reality, leaving the occupant to respond in an ad-hoc or fixed interval way creates unneeded survey fatigue and redundant data. This paper outlines a scenario-based (virtual experiment) method for optimizing data sampling using a smartwatch to achieve comparable accuracy in a personal thermal preference model with fewer data. This method uses BIM-extracted spatial data and Graph Neural Network-based (GNN) modeling to find regions of similar comfort preference to identify the best scenarios for triggering the occupant to give feedback. This method is compared to two baseline scenarios that use conventional zoning and a generic 4x4 square meter grid method from two field-based datasets. The results show that the proposed Build2Vec method has an 18%–23% higher overall sampling quality than the spaces-based and square-grid-based sampling methods. The Build2Vec method also performs similar to the baselines when removing redundant occupant feedback points but with better scalability potential.}

ABSTRACT = {Evaluating and optimising human comfort within the built environment is challenging due to the large number of physiological, psychological and environmental variables that affect occupant comfort preference. Human perception could be helpful to capture these disparate phenomena and interpreting their impact; the challenge is collecting spatially and temporally diverse subjective feedback in a scalable way. This paper presents a methodology to collect intensive longitudinal subjective feedback of comfort-based preference using micro ecological momentary assessments on a smartwatch platform. An experiment with 30 occupants over two weeks produced 4378 field-based surveys for thermal, noise, and acoustic preference. The occupants and the spaces in which they left feedback were then clustered according to these preference tendencies. These groups were used to create different feature sets with combinations of environmental and physiological variables, for use in a multi-class classification task. These classification models were trained on a feature set that was developed from time-series attributes, environmental and near-body sensors, heart rate, and the historical preferences of both the individual and the comfort group assigned. The most accurate model had multi-class classification F1 micro scores of 64%, 80% and 86% for thermal, light, and noise preference, respectively. The discussion outlines how these models can enhance comfort preference prediction when supplementing data from installed sensors. The approach presented prompts reflection on how the building analysis community evaluates, controls, and designs indoor environments through balancing the measurement of variables with occupant preferences in an intensive longitudinal way.},

abstract = {Digital twins offer great opportunities in various domains of the product engineering process. However, current approaches to the use of digital twins only focus on different separated disciplines. In contrast to that, it is expected that the holistic use of digital twin models in product development and production will dominate future product generations, because they allow to create high-performance products competitively. This paper explores important challenges and future potentials of digital twins and Industry 4.0 for the seamless integration of product specification and production. In this regard, approaches of linking digital twins to other domains open up new possibilities in tolerance allocation and production integration. Thereby, the most efficient product specifications in technical and economic terms are achieved for the manufacturer. In addition, the connectivity of Industry 4.0 broadens the scope and enables the evaluation of alternative approaches in production planning and control. Approaches at the organizational level, product functions with specifications beyond the technological limits and production control strategies (e.g. order dispatching) ensure high performance operations. Simulations with a digital production twin with integrated digital product twin allow early estimations even before the actual ramp-up of the product. The future challenge addressed in this paper is to define a consistent framework for the holistic use of digital twins in the entire product development process, which requires the integration of product designers and production planner concepts.},

abstract = {As the Architecture, Engineering and Construction sector is embracing the digital age, the processes involved in the design, construction and operation of built assets are more and more influenced by technologies dealing with value-added monitoring of data from sensor networks, management of this data in secure and resilient storage systems underpinned by semantic models, as well as the simulation and optimisation of engineering systems. Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels. The paper reviews the multi-faceted applications of BIM during the construction stage and highlights limits and requirements, paving the way to the concept of a Construction Digital Twin. A definition of such a concept is then given, described in terms of underpinning research themes, while elaborating on areas for future research.},

abstract = {Building information modeling (BIM) has been widely adopted for representing and exchanging building data across disciplines during building design and construction. However, BIM's use in the building operation phase is limited. With the increasing deployment of low-cost sensors and meters, as well as affordable digital storage and computing technologies, growing volumes of data have been collected from buildings, their energy services systems, and occupants. Such data are crucial to help decision makers understand what, how, and when energy is consumed in buildings—a critical step to improving building performance for energy efficiency, demand flexibility, and resilience. However, practical analyses and use of the collected data are very limited due to various reasons, including poor data quality, ad-hoc representation of data, and lack of data science skills. To unlock value from building data, there is a strong need for a toolchain to curate and represent building information and performance data in common standardized terminologies and schemas, to enable interoperability between tools and applications. This study selected and reviewed 24 data tools based on common use cases of data across the building life cycle, from design to construction, commissioning, operation, and retrofits. The selected data tools are grouped into three categories: (1) data dictionary or terminology, (2) data ontology and schemas, and (3) data platforms. The data are grouped into ten typologies covering most types of data collected in buildings. This study resulted in five main findings: (1) most data representation tools can represent their intended data typologies well, such as Green Button for smart meter data and Brick schema for metadata of sensors in buildings and HVAC systems, but none of the tools cover all ten types of data; (2) there is a need for data schemas to represent the basis of design data and metadata of occupant data; (3) standard terminologies such as those defined in BEDES are only adopted in a few data tools; (4) integrating data across various stages in the building life cycle remains a challenge; and (5) most data tools were developed and maintained by different parties for different purposes, their flexibility and interoperability can be improved to support broader use cases. Finally, recommendations for future research on building data tools are provided for the data and buildings community based on the FAIR principles to make data Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable.},

abstract = {Human comfort studies are a complex topic given their interdisciplinary and multi-stimuli nature. The integration of different sources of information from multi-domain experiments for occupants’ environmental perception investigation can change the way that researchers perceived the interactions among building agents. This study aims to establish a new method for digital twin development from a test room for human-comfort and energy behavior analysis, through a Graph Neural Network. An as-monitored BIM model was integrated with monitoring information, i.e., environmental data from the facility, physiological signals, and survey answers from occupants, and the relationships between the building agents were outlined, based on the experiment purposes. A real-world experiment was adopted to demonstrate the procedure and results, connecting the information from experiments and a test room facility employed to the study. The original approach filled a recurrent gap in human-comfort studies: the integration of all the sources of information in a single visual platform through Graph Neural Networks, allowing the recognition of patterns, connections, and the influence of the diverse stimuli in the human perception of the surrounding environment. In complex building systems, with large sensing structures, high occupancy and multi-source environmental stimuli, new conclusions can be drawn to a full understanding of the human-building interactions.}

ABSTRACT = {The concept of digital twins is proposed as a new technology-led advancement to support the processes of the design, construction, and operation of built assets. Commonalities between the emerging definitions of digital twins describe them as digital or cyber environments that are bidirectionally-linked to their physical or real-life replica to enable simulation and data-centric decision making. Studies have started to investigate their role in the digitalization of asset delivery, including the management of built assets at different levels within the building and infrastructure sectors. However, questions persist regarding their actual applications and implementation challenges, including their integration with other digital technologies (i.e., building information modeling, virtual and augmented reality, Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and cloud computing). Within the built environment context, this study seeks to analyze the definitions and characteristics of a digital twin, its interactions with other digital technologies used in built asset delivery and operation, and its applications and challenges. To achieve this aim, the research utilizes a thorough literature review and semi-structured interviews with ten industry experts. The literature review explores the merits and the relevance of digital twins relative to existing digital technologies and highlights potential applications and challenges for their implementation. The data from the semi-structured interviews are classified into five themes: definitions and enablers of digital twins, applications and benefits, implementation challenges, existing practical applications, and future development. The findings provide a point of departure for future research aimed at clarifying the relationship between digital twins and other digital technologies and their key implementation challenges.},

The effectiveness of the novel methodology and developed software is demonstrated through an application case study involving a recently renewed historic building located in the countryside of Perugia, Italy, and subjected to various monitoring activities within the framework of GEOFIT Horizon 2020 Project. Obtained results highlight the multidisciplinarity and high interoperability of the new approach, whose employment via the developed software led to a comprehensive assessment of the building during its operating conditions.}

abstract = {Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices in buildings and wearable technologies for occupants are quickly becoming widespread. These technologies provide copious amounts of high-quality temporal data pertaining to indoor and outdoor environmental quality, comfort, and energy consumption. However, a barrier to their use in many applications is the lack of spatial context in the built environment. Adding Building Information Models (BIM) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to these temporal sources unleashes potential. We call this data convergence the Internet-of-Buildings or IoB. In this paper, a digital twin case study of data intersection from various systems is outlined. Initial insights are discussed for an experiment with 17 participants that focused on the collection of occupant subjective feedback to characterize indoor comfort. The results illustrate the ability to capture data from wearables in the context of a BIM data environment.}

abstract = {Large scale deployment of sensors is essential to practical applications in cyber physical systems. For instance, instrumenting a commercial building for 'smart energy' management requires deployment and operation of thousands of measurement and metering sensors and actuators that direct operation of the HVAC system. Each of these sensors need to be named consistently and constantly calibrated. Doing this process manually is not only time consuming but also error prone given the scale, heterogeneity and complexity of buildings as well as lack of uniform naming schemas. To address this challenge, we propose Zodiac - a framework for automatically classifying, naming and managing sensors based on active learning from sensor metadata. In contrast to prior work, Zodiac requires minimal user input in terms of labelling examples while being more accurate. To evaluate Zodiac, we deploy it across four real buildings on our campus and label the ground truth metadata for all the sensors in these buildings manually. Using a combination of hierarchical clustering and random forest classifiers we show that Zodiac can successfully classify sensors with an average accuracy of 98\% with 28\% fewer training examples when compared to a regular expression based method.},

ABSTRACT = {Artificial intelligence is set to transform the next generation of intelligent buildings through the application of information and semantic data models and machine learning algorithms. Semantic data models enable the understanding of real-world data for building automation, integration and control applications. This article explored the use of semantic models, a subfield of artificial intelligence, for knowledge representation and reasoning (KRR) across a wide variety of applications in building control, automation and analytics. These KRR-enabled applications include context-aware control of mechanical systems, building energy auditing and commissioning, indoor air monitoring, fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) of mechanical equipment and systems and building-to-grid integration. To this end, this work employed the Apache Jena Application Programming Interface (API) to develop KRR and integrate it with some domain-specific ontologies expressed in the Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Web Ontology Language (OWL). The ontology-driven rules were represented using Jena rule formalisms to enable the inference of implicit information from data asserted in the ontologies. Moreover, SPARQL (SPARQL Query Language for RDF) was used to query the knowledge graph and obtain useful information for a variety of building applications. This approach enhances building analytics through multi-domain knowledge integration; spatial and temporal reasoning for monitoring building operations, and control systems and devices; and the performance of compliance checking. We show that existing studies have not leveraged state-of-the-art ontologies to infer information from different domains. While the proposed semantic infrastructure and methods in this study demonstrated benefits for different building applications applicable to mechanical systems, the approach also has great potential for lighting, shading and security applications. Multi-domain knowledge integration that includes spatial and temporal reasoning allows the optimization of the performance of building equipment and systems.},

ABSTRACT = {The importance of building information is highly attached to the ability of conventional storing to provide professional analysis. The Internet of Things (IoT) and smart devices offer a vast amount of live data stored in heterogeneous repositories, and hence the need for smart methodologies to facilitate IoT–BIM integration is very crucial. The first step to better integrating IoT and Building Information Modeling (BIM) can be performed by implementing the Service-Oriented-Architecture (SOA) to combining software and other services by replacing the sematic information that was failed to display elements of indoor conditions. The other development is to create link that able to update static models towards real-time models using SOA approach. The existing approach relies on one-way interaction; however, developing two-way communication to mimic human cognitive has become very crucial. The high-tech approach requires highly involving Cloud computations to better connect IoT devices throughout Internet infrastructure. This approach is based on the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) with real-time data from IoT devices aiming at improving construction and operational efficiencies and to provide high-fidelity BIM models for numerous applications. The paper discusses challenges, limitations, and barriers that face BIM–IoT integration and simultaneously solves interoperability issues and Cloud computing. The paper provides a comprehensive review that explores and identifies common emerging areas of application and common design patterns of the traditional BIM-IoT integration followed by devising better methodologies to integrate IoT in BIM.},

abstract = {Interoperability in the Internet of Things relies on a common data model that captures the necessary semantics for vendor independent application development and data exchange. However, traditional systems such as those in building management are vertically integrated and do not use a standard schema. A typical building can consist of thousands of data points. Third party vendors who seek to deploy applications like fault diagnosis need to manually map the building information into a common schema. This mapping process requires deep domain expertise and a detailed understanding of intricacies of each building's system. Our framework - Scrabble - reduces the mapping effort significantly by using a multi-stage active learning mechanism that exploits the structure present in a standard schema and learns from buildings that have already been mapped to the schema. Scrabble uses conditional random fields with transfer learning to represent unstructured building information in a reusable intermediate representation. This reusable representation is mapped to the schema using a multilayer perceptron. Our novel semantic model based active learning mechanism requires only minimal input from domain experts to interpret esoteric, idiosyncratic data points. We have evaluated Scrabble on five buildings with thousands of different entities and our method outperforms prior work by 59%/162% higher Accuracy/Macro-averaged-F1 in a building when 10 examples are provided by an expert in both cases. Scrabble achieves 99% Accuracy with 100--160 examples for buildings with thousands of points while the other baselines cannot.},

ABSTRACT = {BIM (building information modeling) is a kind of technology that has great potential to enhance the level of automation in architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) projects. The created virtual model of the facility allows coordinating all industries during the entire life cycle of the building. The possibility to save the data related to the given facility in one place, namely in the BIM model, enables control and management of the AEC projects at every stage. During the design and implementation phase, BIM models facilitate the optimization of time, costs, and quality, and in the operational phase, they support effective management of the facility. The use of BIM for building energy modeling (BEM) is the next step of evolution in architecture and engineering design practice. The benefits of using the BIM approach are widely discussed in the literature; however, they may be hard to achieve if appropriate attention is not directed to minimizing the barriers to the implementation of this technology. Observing Europe, one can notice that western and northern countries successfully use BIM for their needs, while the countries of the Eastern Bloc, including Poland, introduce it at a slower pace. In the present paper, the authors conducted a cause-and-effect analysis of the identified barriers to the implementation of BIM technology in the construction process. For this purpose, the authors applied the Ishikawa diagram, which is a tool that helps to recognize the actual or potential causes of failure. The analysis conducted showed that one of the weakest links in the successful BIM implementation is people and, in particular, their lack of knowledge and reluctance to change. The authors indicated the need to introduce and strengthen preventive actions, mainly through education: training, courses, and studies focused on BIM technology.},

ABSTRACT = {The low accessibility to the information regarding buildings current performances causes deep difficulties in planning appropriate interventions. Internet of Things (IoT) sensors make available a high quantity of data on energy consumptions and indoor conditions of an existing building that can drive the choice of energy retrofit interventions. Moreover, the current developments in the topic of the digital twin are leading the diffusion of Building Information Modeling (BIM) methods and tools that can provide valid support to manage all data and information for the retrofit process. This paper shows the aim and the findings of research focused on testing the integrated use of BIM methodology and IoT systems. A common data platform for the visualization of building indoor conditions (e.g., temperature, luminance etc.) and of energy consumption parameters was carried out. This platform, tested on a case study located in Italy, is developed with the integration of low-cost IoT sensors and the Revit model. To obtain a dynamic and automated exchange of data between the sensors and the BIM model, the Revit software was integrated with the Dynamo visual programming platform and with a specific Application Programming Interface (API). It is an easy and straightforward tool that can provide building managers with real-time data and information about the energy consumption and the indoor conditions of buildings, but also allows for viewing of the historical sensor data table and creating graphical historical sensor data. Furthermore, the BIM model allows the management of other useful information about the building, such as dimensional data, functions, characteristics of the components of the building, maintenance status etc., which are essential for a much more conscious, effective and accurate management of the building and for defining the most suitable retrofit scenarios.},

ABSTRACT = {This paper focuses on the definition of a method supported by digital processes for a sustainable and user-orientated re-design of the existing building stock. Based on the analysis of the methodological and procedural aspects of the computational approach to architectural design in relation to different performance conditions, the research addresses the adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM), intended as a powerful method for coordinating the complexity of the multiple, interdisciplinary and conflicting aspects involved in the rehabilitation of buildings. In addition to the advantages in terms of control and management, the BIM process has proven its effectiveness in tackling the issue of sustainability, allowing all actors involved in the research to share information and pro-actively control various outcomes of a building’s performance, such as energy and environmental quality. To show the opportunities and limitations of the digital management in information-based processes, the activities carried out in the framework of the European Horizon 2020 project “Pro-GET-onE—Proactive synergy of inteGrated Efficient Technologies on buildings’ Envelopes” are reported. The research, based on a case study method, which is applied to a student residence in Athens, demonstrates that BIM possesses great potentialities for developing effective and efficient construction and renovation processes toward buildings with high quality standards.},

ABSTRACT = {Digital and intelligent buildings are critical to realizing efficient building energy operations and a smart grid. With the increasing digitalization of processes throughout the life cycle of buildings, data exchanged between stakeholders and between building systems have grown significantly. However, a lack of semantic interoperability between data in different systems is still prevalent and hinders the development of energy-oriented applications that can be reused across buildings, limiting the scalability of innovative solutions. Addressing this challenge, our review paper systematically reviews metadata schemas and ontologies that are at the foundation of semantic interoperability necessary to move toward improved building energy operations. The review finds 40 schemas that span different phases of the building life cycle, most of which cover commercial building operations and, in particular, control and monitoring systems. The paper’s deeper review and analysis of five popular schemas identify several gaps in their ability to fully facilitate the work of a building modeler attempting to support three use cases: energy audits, automated fault detection and diagnosis, and optimal control. Our findings demonstrate that building modelers focused on energy use cases will find it difficult, labor intensive, and costly to create, sustain, and use semantic models with existing ontologies. This underscores the significant work still to be done to enable interoperable, usable, and maintainable building models. We make three recommendations for future work by the building modeling and energy communities: a centralized repository with a search engine for relevant schemas, the development of more use cases, and better harmonization and standardization of schemas in collaboration with industry to facilitate their adoption by stakeholders addressing varied energy-focused use cases.},

abstract = {Buildings account for 32% of worldwide energy usage. A new regime of exciting new “applications” that span a distributed fabric of sensors, actuators and humans has emerged to improve building energy efficiency and operations management. These applications leverage the technological advances in embedded sensing, processing, networking and methods by which they can be coupled with supervisory control and data acquisition systems deployed in modern buildings and with users on mobile wireless platforms. There are, however, several technical challenges to confront before such a vision of smart building applications and cyber-physical systems can be realized. The sensory data produced by these systems need significant curation before it can be used meaningfully. This is largely a manual, cost-prohibitive task and hence such solutions rarely experience widespread adoption due to the lack of a common descriptive schema. Recent attempts have sought to address this through data standards and metadata schemata but fall short in capturing the richness of relationships required by applications. This paper describes Brick, a uniform metadata schema for representing buildings that builds upon recent advances in the area. Our schema defines a concrete ontology for sensors, subsystems and the relationships between them, which enables portable applications. We demonstrate the completeness and effectiveness of Brick by using it to represent the entire vendor-specific sensor metadata of six diverse buildings across different campuses, comprising 17,700 data points, and running eight unmodified energy efficiency applications on these buildings.}

abstract = {Commercial buildings account for a large amount of delivered energy in the U.S., nearly 42% of which is consumed in buildings with digital control systems {EIA}. These buildings are a ripe venue to deploy novel applications because of (a) access to sensors and actuators that are used in their digital control systems, (b) deployed wireless sensor networks, and (c) the advent of smart "internet-of-things" sensors. However, these novel applications face a fundamental scalability challenge because the sensor metadata across buildings do not follow any common schema. In this paper, we quantify the shortcomings of three metadata schemas which have gained traction in modeling the contextual, spatial and functional relationships between sensors in the built environment: (1) Project Haystack, (2) Industry Foundation Classes (3) and Semantic Sensor Web against three commercial buildings and an extensive list of smart-building applications.},

Manual point mapping is labor intensive and costly, presenting a major impediment to innovations in building control (e.g., automated fault detection and diagnostics, self-healing, and automated commissioning for existing building control systems). The methods reviewed focus on classifying building control system points, especially sensor classifications by sensor type. Fewer publications address other important aspects of the point mapping problem, such as discovering spatial and functional relationships among points, relationships between control system points, physical systems, and equipment, and between various equipment and the systems of which they are part, and discovering metadata, normalizing it to a common namespace, and assigning the metadata to control system points. To motivate further development of new automated point mapping approaches, we identify many research questions organized into four key technical needs: 1) a complete solution and underlying problem formulation, 2) alignment of methods with the actual point mapping problem, 3) test cases, data sets for testing, explicit test procedures, and consistent performance metrics for reporting testing and evaluation results, and 4) understanding of the applicable data space to ensure future adaptability of automated BAS point mapping.}

Building Management Systems (BMS) are central to these operations and generate a huge amount of data. Traditionally operated in a local server in a building, state-of-art BMS solutions are now moving towards the cloud. Internet of Things (IoT) meters and sensors are also increasingly used in buildings and hold tremendous potential for smart building monitoring and control. Another valuable data source is a properly developed and managed Building Information Model (BIM). BIM itself is moving towards Level 3, which is web-based and data-driven, as opposed to the file-based BIM of today. Improving building performance (e.g., energy, comfort, operational cost) relies on data from all the above systems. However, these data usually remain siloed within their own environment and do not provide an opportunity to perform evaluations across multiple systems. Moreover, valuable information about geometry, spatial location, and metadata about the building objects that the BIM models already contain remains unusable for building performance monitoring and reporting tools. Integrating these heterogeneous data sources will provide ample opportunities to improve building performance. Even though some commercial tools enable the integration of sensor data with BIM models, such tools remain largely proprietary and are not compatible with other applications. This study presents a methodology to integrate multiple information sources at their system level in a distributed manner. The Industry Foundation Class (IFC) model of the building is used as the primary source of information for creating a semantic building graph. Since the semantics of BMS sensors was not originally available in the IFC model, the Brick ontology is used to semantically describe BMS sensors in the graph. Sensor data related to spaces in the BIM model is visualized by selecting a space from the 3D model via the web application. Each data stream remains in its optimum environment and the connections are made via an Application Programming Interface (API).&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;}, journal={CLIMA 2022 conference}, author={Chamari, Lasitha and Petrova, Ekaterina and Pauwels, Pieter}, year={2022}, month={May} }

ABSTRACT = {The importance of building information is highly attached to the ability of conventional storing to provide professional analysis. The Internet of Things (IoT) and smart devices offer a vast amount of live data stored in heterogeneous repositories, and hence the need for smart methodologies to facilitate IoT–BIM integration is very crucial. The first step to better integrating IoT and Building Information Modeling (BIM) can be performed by implementing the Service-Oriented-Architecture (SOA) to combining software and other services by replacing the sematic information that was failed to display elements of indoor conditions. The other development is to create link that able to update static models towards real-time models using SOA approach. The existing approach relies on one-way interaction; however, developing two-way communication to mimic human cognitive has become very crucial. The high-tech approach requires highly involving Cloud computations to better connect IoT devices throughout Internet infrastructure. This approach is based on the integration of Building Information Modeling (BIM) with real-time data from IoT devices aiming at improving construction and operational efficiencies and to provide high-fidelity BIM models for numerous applications. The paper discusses challenges, limitations, and barriers that face BIM–IoT integration and simultaneously solves interoperability issues and Cloud computing. The paper provides a comprehensive review that explores and identifies common emerging areas of application and common design patterns of the traditional BIM-IoT integration followed by devising better methodologies to integrate IoT in BIM.},

ABSTRACT = {This study investigates the feasibility and benefits of transferring data between Autodesk Revit (used for building information modeling (BIM)) and BUILDER SMS (used for sustainable facility management (SFM)). Two data transfer methods were evaluated using a case study; one involved entirely manual data transfer, the other a combination of manual and automatic. Of the data transfer methods evaluated, the manual/automated hybrid was determined to be the best option, especially when regular updates are envisioned. The case study produced an enhanced BIM model that can be used to support sustainable facility management, called here an SFM-enhanced BIM model. An integration workflow is proposed for efficiently creating future SFM-enhanced BIM models. A focus group of facilities management professionals evaluated the case study BIM model. The focus group was most interested in the visualization capabilities—e.g., filtered views for condition assessments—and the ability to view the BIM model on a tablet/mobile device during on-site operation and maintenance activities.},

abstract = {The built environment provides significant opportunities for IoT (Internet of Things) deployment, and can be singled out as one of the most important aspects for IoT related research. While the IoT deployment in the built environment is growing exponentially, there exists a gap in integrating these two in a systematic way through open standards and systems. From technological perspective, there is a need for convergence of diverse fields ranging from Building Information Systems and Building Services to Building Automation Systems, and IoT devices and finally the end user services to develop smart, user oriented applications. This paper outlines the efforts to develop a platform that integrates the built environment data with IoT sensors in a campus wide, web based system called Otaniemi3D that provides information about energy usage, occupancy and user comfort by integrating Building Information Models and IoT devices through open messaging standards (O-MI and O-DF) and IFC models. The paper describes the design criteria, the system architecture, the workflow and a proof of concept with potential use cases that integrate IoT with the built environment. Initial results show that both the end users and other research groups can benefit from such platforms by either consuming the data in their daily life or using the data for more advance research.}

abstract = {Energy-related behaviors of occupants constitute a key factor influencing building performance; accordingly, the measured occupant data can support the objective assessment of the indoor environment and energy performance of buildings, which can inform building design and operational decisions. Existing data schemas focus on metadata of sensors, meters, physical equipment, and IoT devices in buildings; however, they are limited in representing the metadata of occupant data, including occupants' presence in spaces, movement between spaces, interactions with building systems or IoT devices, and preference of indoor environmental needs. To address this gap, an extension to the widely adopted metadata schema, Brick, is proposed to represent the contextual, behavioral, and demographic information of occupants. The proposed extension includes four parts: (1) a new “Occupant” class to represent occupants' demography and energy related behavioral patterns, (2) new subclasses under the Equipment class to represent envelope system and personal thermal comfort devices, (3) new subclasses under the Point class to represent occupant sensing and status, and (4) new auxiliary properties for occupant interactable equipment to represent the level of controllability for each piece of equipment by occupants. The extension is implemented in the Brick schema and has been tested using multiple occupant datasets from the ASHRAE Global Occupant Database. The extension enables Brick schema to capture diverse types of occupant sensing data and their metadata for FAIR data research and applications.}

                   developed Cozie an open-source application for the Apple
                   Watch and iPhone. Cozie allows people to complete a short
                   survey and provide real-time feedback about indoor
                   environmental conditions via their smartwatch. This approach
                   reduces the effort it takes for occupants to provide
                   feedback. In addition, Cozie leverages the watch's inbuilt
                   sensors that monitor and log several physiological
                   parameters (e.g., heart rate, activity). The data collected
                   using Cozie has, therefore, the potential of allowing
                   researchers and practitioners to better understand the needs
                   and perceptions of occupants in real time. This may allow
                   them to better design and operate new and existing
                   buildings. Cozie could also help to shift towards an
                   occupant-centric control of buildings, that adjusts indoor
                   environmental conditions in real-time utilizing collected
                   from the occupants.",
