  "abstract": "We analyze the influence of disorder and strong correlations on the topology in two dimensional Chern insulators. A mean field calculation in the half-filled Haldane model with extended Hubbard interactions and Anderson disorder shows that disorder favors topology in the interacting case and extends the topological phase to a larger region of the Hubbard parameters. In the absence of a staggered potential, we find a novel disorder-driven topological phase with Chern number C=1, with co-existence of topology with long range spin and charge orders. More conventional topological Anderson insulating phases are also found in the presence of a finite staggered potential.",
