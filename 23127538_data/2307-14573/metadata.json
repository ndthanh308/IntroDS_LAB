  "abstract": "The classical Capelli identity is an important determinantal identity of a matrix with noncommutative entries that determines the center of the enveloping algebra of the general linear Lie algebra, and was used by Weyl as a main tool to study irreducible representations in his famous book on classical groups.\n  In 1996 Okounkov found higher Capelli identities involving immanants of the generating matrix of $U(gl(n))$ which correspond to arbitrary orthogonal idempotent of the symmetric group. It turns out that Williamson also discovered a general Capelli identity of immanants for $U(gl(n))$ in 1981. In this paper, we use a new method to derive a family of even more general Capelli identities that include the aforementioned Capelli identities as special cases as well as many other Capelli-type identities as corollaries. In particular, we obtain generalized Turnbull's identities for both symmetric and antisymmetric matrices, as well as the generalized Howe-Umeda-Kostant-Sahi identities for antisymmetric matrices which confirm the conjecture of Caracciolo, Sokal, and Sportiello.",
