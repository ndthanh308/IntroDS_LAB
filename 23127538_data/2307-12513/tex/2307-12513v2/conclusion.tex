\section{Concluding remarks}

In this paper, we investigate the problem of correcting matrix products over the ring of integers. We propose a simple deterministic $O(\sqrt{k}n^2+k^2n)$-time algorithm, where $n$ is the row- and column-dimensions, and $k$ is an upper bound on the number of erroneous entries. When $k<n$, the proposed algorithm is more efficient than the naive $\Theta(n^3)$-time algorithm to multiply two $n\times n$ matrices. For certain $k$, it also slightly improves the existing ones, e.g.~\cite{GkasieniecLLPT17,Kunnemann18,kutzkov}. In addition, the values involved during the execution are in a reasonable range, namely polynomial in $n$ and the input values, so the algorithm can be implemented with the requested time complexity on conventional computation models.
