\section{Concluding remarks}

In this paper, we investigate the problem of correcting matrix products over the ring of integers. We propose a simple deterministic $O(\sqrt{k}n^2+k^2n)$-time algorithm, where $n$ is the number of rows/columns and $k$ is the number of erroneous entries. The largest value involved during the execution is of $O(\alpha^2n^3)$, where $\alpha$ is the largest absolute value of the entries of the input matrices. 

\medskip
We note that when the values of the entries are polynomial bounded in $n$, the asymptotic behavior of K\"{u}nnemann's algorithm, which runs in $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{k}n^2 + k^2)$ time, outperforms ours. However, our algorithm can still serve as a simple alternative.
