  "abstract": "The aggregation of particles in the free molecular regime is determined approximately for situations with a high degree of translational energy equilibration. The mean particle sizes develop linearly in time. Scaling relations are used to derive a linear partial differential equation which is solved to show that the size distributions are close to log-normal asymptotically in time.",
