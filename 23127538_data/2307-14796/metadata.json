  "abstract": "In low $γ$ regimes the inevitable induced energy spread in combination with longitudinal dispersion during the drift through a transverse deflecting structure (TDS) can alter the phase space of the particle bunch to be characterized. The consequential bunch lengthening can render measuring ultra-short bunches impossible, even for high available streaking powers and hence theoretical resolution. In this work the resulting effective resolution of a TDS is estimated analytically and the optimal streaking voltage is determined. The findings are subsequently benchmarked using matrix-based particle tracking. Furthermore, additional transverse, as well as other resolution limiting effects of a realistic streaking setup are discussed. A potential mitigation scheme using an additional downstream focusing element is evaluated.",
