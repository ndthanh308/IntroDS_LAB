  abstract = {An X-band TDS is a well-known device for the characterization of the longitudinal properties of an electron bunch in a linear accelerator. It is planned that a novel X-band TDS with variable polarization will be installed within the next few years at SINBAD, an upcoming accelerator R&D facility at DESY. There are several measurements that can be performed with the TDS, each with specific optics requirements to reach the highest possible resolution and keep induced energy spread to a tolerable level. Quadrupoles will be installed between the TDS and the screen to help satisfy these conditions. In this paper, the requirements for the bunch length measurements, a novel 3D charge density reconstruction technique and slice energy measurements are discussed and some simulation results for the slice energy measurement using example lattices are presented.}

title = {A Transverse RF Deflecting Structure for Bunch Length and Phase Space Diagnostics},
author = {Emma, Paul J},
abstractNote = {A traveling wave transverse rf deflecting structure is discussed as a tool for bunch length measurement and as an aid to detailed phase space diagnostics in future FEL projects. The high frequency time variation of the deflecting fields is used to 'pitch' or 'yaw' the electron bunch where the resulting transverse beam width measured on a simple profile monitor represents a reliable, single-shot measure of the absolute bunch length. A small rf phase shift, from the zero-crossing, adds a net centroid kick to the bunch so that it intercepts an off-axis screen. The deflecting rf is then pulsed at a much lower rate than the machine rate, and a pulse-stealing process is used to monitor the bunch length continuously. Multiple screens at appropriate phase advance locations might also be used to monitor the 'slice' (i.e., time-correlated) transverse emittance. A screen placed at a point of significant momentum dispersion can also be used to reveal the time-dependent energy spread. Suitable S-band structures were built and tested in the 1960's at SLAC and one has now been installed in the SLAC linac and configured to measure bunch lengths of test beams. Simulations of these schemes are presented for the Linac Coherent Light Source [LCLS Design Study Report, SLAC-R-521, April 1998] and the existing SLAC linac.},

      abstract     = {From plasma-wakefield acceleration as a physics experiment
                      toward a plasma-based accelerator as a user facility, the
                      beam physics issues remaining to be solved are still
                      numerous. Providing beams with high energy, charge, and
                      quality simultaneously, not only within the plasma but also
                      at the user doorstep itself, is the main concern. Despite
                      its tremendous efficiency in particle acceleration, the
                      wakefield displays a complex 3D profile which, associated to
                      the beam-loading field induced by the accelerated beam
                      itself, makes the acceleration of high charge to high energy
                      often incompatible with high beam quality. Beam extraction
                      from the plasma without quality degradation for a transfer
                      either to the next plasma stage or to the user application
                      is another difficulty to consider. This article presents the
                      substantial studies carried out and the different innovative
                      methods employed for tackling all these different issues.
                      Efforts focused on achieving the challenging beam parameters
                      targeted by the EuPRAXIA accelerator facility project. The
                      lessons learned at the end of these in-depth simulations and
                      optimizations are highlighted. The sensitivity to different
                      error sources is also estimated to point out the critical
                      components of such an accelerator. Finally, the needs in
                      terms of laser and plasma parameters are provided.},

abstract = {Pulsed, ultrahigh dose-rate irradiation is safer than standard radiotherapy for the treatment of lung cancer and selectively spares normal tissue. Radiation is used to treat a variety of tumor types, including lung cancer. Unfortunately, radiation-induced damage to the surrounding healthy lung is a major problem, which can cause long-term complications and limits the amount of radiation that can be safely delivered to the tumor. Favaudon et al. now present a technology called FLASH, which allows the delivery of pulsed, ultrahigh dose-rate irradiation, which causes less damage to the healthy lung than conventional radiotherapy in mouse models. The authors confirmed that FLASH is effective against tumor cells but causes little damage to normal tissue. These results suggest that FLASH radiation may be a viable option for treating lung tumors, although this will need to be confirmed in human patients. In vitro studies suggested that sub-millisecond pulses of radiation elicit less genomic instability than continuous, protracted irradiation at the same total dose. To determine the potential of ultrahigh dose-rate irradiation in radiotherapy, we investigated lung fibrogenesis in C57BL/6J mice exposed either to short pulses (≤500 ms) of radiation delivered at ultrahigh dose rate (≥40 Gy/s, FLASH) or to conventional dose-rate irradiation (≤0.03 Gy/s, CONV) in single doses. The growth of human HBCx-12A and HEp-2 tumor xenografts in nude mice and syngeneic TC-1 Luc+ orthotopic lung tumors in C57BL/6J mice was monitored under similar radiation conditions. CONV (15 Gy) triggered lung fibrosis associated with activation of the TGF-β (transforming growth factor–β) cascade, whereas no complications developed after doses of FLASH below 20 Gy for more than 36 weeks after irradiation. FLASH irradiation also spared normal smooth muscle and epithelial cells from acute radiation-induced apoptosis, which could be reinduced by administration of systemic TNF-α (tumor necrosis factor–α) before irradiation. In contrast, FLASH was as efficient as CONV in the repression of tumor growth. Together, these results suggest that FLASH radiotherapy might allow complete eradication of lung tumors and reduce the occurrence and severity of early and late complications affecting normal tissue.}

ABSTRACT = {Over the years, the generation and acceleration of ultra-short, high quality electron beams has attracted more and more interest in accelerator science. Electron bunches with these properties are necessary to operate and test novel diagnostics and advanced high-gradient accelerating schemes, such as plasma accelerators and dielectric laser accelerators. Furthermore, several medical and industrial applications require high-brightness electron beams. The dedicated R&amp;D facility ARES at DESY (Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron) will provide such probe beams in the upcoming years. After the setup of the normal-conducting, radio-frequency (RF) photoinjector and linear accelerating structures, ARES successfully started the beam commissioning of the RF gun. This paper gives an overview of the ARES photoinjector setup and summarizes the results of the gun commissioning process. The quality of the first electron beams is characterized in terms of charge, momentum, momentum spread and beam size. Additionally, the dependencies of the beam parameters on RF settings are described. All measurement results of the characterized beams fulfill the requirements for operating the ARES linac with this RF photoinjector.},

abstract = {In this work we present the outlines of possible experiments for dielectric laser acceleration (DLA) of ultra-short relativistic electron bunches produced by the ARES linac, currently under construction at the SINBAD facility (DESY Hamburg). The experiments are to be performed as part of the Accelerator on a Chip International Program (ACHIP), funded by the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation. At SINBAD we plan to test the acceleration of already pre-accelerated relativistic electron bunches in laser-illuminated dielectric grating structures. We present outlines of both the acceleration of ultra-short single bunches, as well as the option to accelerate phase-synchronous sub-fs microbunch trains. Here the electron bunch is conditioned prior to the injection by interaction with an external laser field in an undulator. This generates a sinusoidal energy modulation that is transformed into periodic microbunches in a subsequent chicane. The phase synchronization is achieved by driving both the modulation process and the DLA with the same laser pulse. In addition to the conceptual layouts and plans of the experiments we present start-to-end simulation results for different ARES working points.}
