\section{Results}
\label{sec:result}

The main question we asked is about what contracts are most needed by \ML API users. In this section, we present the quantitative data (e.g., representing contract violation patterns, root cause, effect, contract comprehension challenges, etc.) to show the places where immediate support for contracts is needed. Hence, we analyze the results from our \SO~study 
to answer the research questions from \S{\ref*{sec:intro}}, 
report our findings on the original (and the filtered subset) dataset described in \S{\ref*{sec:data}}, and discuss implications and actionable insights.
