\subsection{Classification of Effects}
\label{subsec:class}

We used a prior work \cite{islam19} for classifying the effects to the 
root causes discussed in \S{\ref{subsec:con}}. It has six categories: bad performance (BP), crash (C), data 
corruption (DC), hang (H), incorrect functionality (IF), and 
memory out of bound (MOB). We have added one category Unknown (U)
besides these categories to identify cases that remain non-classified. 
The details about this classification of effect are discussed in Table~\ref{tab:classeffect}.

\hline
Bad Performance &
  Common effect in ML software; \ML API users face model problems even though they use deep learning APIs correctly because APIs in these libraries are abstract. \\ \hline
Crash &
  Frequent effect in ML. In fact, any kind of contract violation can lead to a Crash. A symptom of the crash is that the software stops running and prints out an error message. \\ \hline
Data Corruption &
  This happens when the data is corrupted while flowing through the network, and a user gets unexpected output. This effect is a consequence of misunderstanding the ML APIs. \\ \hline
Hang &
  Hang is caused when ML software ceases to respond to inputs due to slow hardware or inappropriate ML algorithm. Software running for a long period of time without providing the desired output is considered as a symptom. \\ \hline
Incorrect Functionality &
  It occurs when the software behaves unexpectedly without any runtime or compile-time error due to the incorrect output format, model layers not working desirably, etc. \\ \hline
Memory Out of Bound &
  ML software often halts due to the unavailability of the memory resources for the wrong model structure or not having enough computing resources to train a model. \\ \hline
Unknown &
  Sometimes the effect of ML contract violation is unknown. We have added this category for cases that remain non-classified. \\ \hline
