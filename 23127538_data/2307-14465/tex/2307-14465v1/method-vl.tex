\subsection{Classification of ML Contract Violation Locations}
\label{subsec:vl}

As we investigated the requirements for \ML~contracts, we also classified the 
API locations of the contracts being violated. 

We based this classification on prior works \cite{stages, islam19}, and used a similar open coding strategy as we did when conceiving the classification for contract types. 
The categories are explained in Table~\ref{tab:class2}.

	{\cellcolor[gray]{.9}Data Preprocessing} & These APIs pre-process data before feeding it to \ML~models. \\

	{\cellcolor[gray]{.9}Model Construction} & These APIs are used to build \ML~models, either from scratch, by accessing a predefined model, or by compiling constructed models. \\

	{\cellcolor[gray]{.9}Model Evaluation} & APIs used to estimate the generalization accuracy of a model. \\
	\hline		
	{\cellcolor[gray]{.9}Model Initialization} & APIs used for initializing a predefined model, e.g., an API to load random weights for a model.\\
	\hline
	\rowcolor{white}
	{\cellcolor[gray]{.9}Train} & Describes APIs that determine values for weights and biases of a model.\\
	\hline

	{\cellcolor[gray]{.9}Hyper-parameter Tuning} $\;$ & Describes APIs that change hyper-parameter(s) that control the learning process.\\
	\hline
	{\cellcolor[gray]{.9}Load} & Describes APIs that load or store data from external storage. \\
