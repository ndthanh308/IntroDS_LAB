  "abstract": "We prove Sobolev regularity for distributional solutions to the Dirichlet problem for generators of $2s$-stable processes and exterior data, inhomogeneity in weighted $L^2$-spaces. This class of operators includes the fractional Laplacian. For these rough exterior data the theory of weak variational solutions is not applicable. Our regularity estimate is robust in the limit $s\\to 1-$ which allows us to recover the local theory.",
