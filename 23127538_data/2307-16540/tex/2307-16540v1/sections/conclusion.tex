\section{Conclusion}

Worst-case optimal join algorithms and adaptive processing strategies have been two of the most exciting advances in join processing over the past decades. Worst-case optimal joins enable efficient processing of cyclic queries. Adaptive processing allows handling complex queries where a-priori optimization is hard. For the first time, ADOPT brings together these two techniques, resulting in attractive performance for both acyclic and cyclic queries and in particular excellent performance for large cyclic queries.

ADOPT is an adaptive framework readily applicable to further query processing techniques, e.g., factorized databases~\cite{DBLP:journals/pvldb/BakibayevKOZ13} and functional aggregate queries~\cite{DBLP:journals/sigmod/Khamis0R17}. These works combine worst-case optimal joins with effective techniques to push aggregates past joins to achieve the best known computational complexity for query evaluation. In future work, we plan to merge this line of work with ADOPT-style adaptivity.
