Is there any prior work on the performance impact of different variable orders on worst-case optimal join algorithms?

Is there any prior work on worst-case optimal algorithms that do not depend on a variable order (following~\cite{Navarro2019})?

Possibilities to include non-intrusive versions of the learning approach into LogicBlox?
