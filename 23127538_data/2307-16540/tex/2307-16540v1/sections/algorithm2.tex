\section{Algorithm}
\label{sec:algorithm}

We discuss the algorithm used by ADOPT in detail. Section~\ref{sub:main} discusses the top-level function, used to process queries. Section~\ref{sub:join} introduces ADOPT's parallel anytime join algorithm with worst-case optimality guarantees. Section~\ref{sub:cubes} discusses the mechanism by which ADOPT avoids redundant work across different attribute orders. Section~\ref{sub:rl} describes how ADOPT selects attribute orders via reinforcement learning. Finally, Section~\ref{sub:estimation} describes the reward metric used to guide the learning algorithm.
