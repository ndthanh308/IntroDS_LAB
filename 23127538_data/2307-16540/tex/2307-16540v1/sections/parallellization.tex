Figure~\ref{fig:speedup} plots the speedup of ADOPT as a function of the number of threads. ADOPT achieves significant speedups for large clique and cycle queries. In particular, it achieves nearly 30x speedup on 5- and 6-clique, and 40x speedup on 5-cycle (with 48 threads). The main reason is that the hypercube approach partitions disjointly the workload across threads, minimizing synchronization overheads. %and makes the computation synchronization-free and therefore fully parallelizable.


%avoids concurrent data structures to remove duplicate tuples from different orders and thus can be fully parallelized.

% For complex queries (e.g., 5 cycle and 6 clique), ADOPT
