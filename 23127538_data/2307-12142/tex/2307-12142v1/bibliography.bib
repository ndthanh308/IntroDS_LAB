Whenever the relative phase between the pulses is in the range [-{$\pi$}/2, {$\pi$}/2], a stable solitonlike waveform is formed. Otherwise the soliton pulse rapidly decays into dispersive waves. We describe the potential of this effect for coherent-phase detection of solitons, optical-pulse compression, and all-optical switching.

  abstract = {Solitons are shape preserving waveforms that are ubiquitous across nonlinear dynamical systems from BEC to hydrodynamics, and fall into two separate classes: bright solitons existing in anomalous group velocity dispersion, and switching waves forming `dark solitons' in normal dispersion. Bright solitons in particular have been relevant to chip-scale microresonator frequency combs, used in applications across communications, metrology, and spectroscopy. Both have been studied, yet the existence of a structure between this dichotomy has only been theoretically predicted. We report the observation of dissipative structures embodying a hybrid between switching waves and dissipative solitons, existing in the regime of vanishing group velocity dispersion where third-order dispersion is dominant, hence termed as `zero-dispersion solitons'. They are observed to arise from the interlocking of two modulated switching waves, forming a stable solitary structure consisting of a quantized number of peaks. The switching waves form directly via synchronous pulse-driving of a Si3N4 microresonator. The resulting comb spectrum spans 136 THz or 97\% of an octave, further enhanced by higher-order dispersive wave formation. This dissipative structure expands the domain of Kerr cavity physics to the regime near to zero-dispersion and could present a superior alternative to conventional solitons for broadband comb generation.},

This situation is similar to that faced by Leeuwenhoek in the seventeenth century, whose work to improve the quality of glass lenses led directly to his discovery of the ubiquitous ``animalcules'' in canal water, the first hints of the cellular basis of life. The electron optical aberration problem was well understood from the start, but more than 60 years elapsed before a practical correction scheme for electron microscopy was demonstrated2, and even then the remaining chromatic aberrations still limited the resolution. We report here the implementation of a computer-controlled aberration correction system in a scanning transmission electron microscope3, which is less sensitive to chromatic aberration. Using this approach, we achieve an electron probe smaller than 1\,\AA. This performance, about 20 times the electron wavelength at 120\,keV energy, allows dynamic imaging of single atoms, clusters of a few atoms, and single atomic layer `rafts' of atoms coexisting with Au islands on a carbon substrate. This technique should also allow atomic column imaging of semiconductors, for detection of single dopant atoms, using an electron beam with energy below the damage threshold for silicon.},

In the presence of higher-order dispersion, optical solitons can emit dispersive waves via the process of soliton Cherenkov radiation. This process underlies supercontinuum generation and is of critical importance in frequency metrology. Using a continuous wave\textendash pumped, dispersion-engineered, integrated silicon nitride microresonator, we generated continuously circulating temporal dissipative Kerr solitons. The presence of higher-order dispersion led to the emission of red-shifted soliton Cherenkov radiation. The output corresponds to a fully coherent optical frequency comb that spans two-thirds of an octave and whose phase we were able to stabilize to the sub-Hertz level. By preserving coherence over a broad spectral bandwidth, our device offers the opportunity to develop compact on-chip frequency combs for frequency metrology or spectroscopy.}

Here, we investigate the effect of the polarization and the spatial profile of plasmonic near-field distributions on shaping free-electrons and controlling the energy transfer mechanisms, but also tailoring the electron recoil. We particularly show that polarization of the exciting light can be used as a control knop for disseminating the acceleration and deceleration path ways via the experienced electron recoil. We also demonstrate the possibility of tailoring the shape of the localized plasmons by incorporating specific arrangements of nanorods to enhance or hamper the transversal and longitudinal recoils of free-electrons. Our findings open up a route towards plasmonic near-fields-engineering for the coherent manipulation and control of slow electron beams for creating desired shapes of electron wavepackets.},

As a result, they respond to different forms of input noise.

  abstract = {The use of infrared lasers to power optical-scale lithographically fabricated particle accelerators is a developing area of research that has garnered increasing interest in recent years. The physics and technology of this approach is reviewed, which is referred to as dielectric laser acceleration (DLA). In the DLA scheme operating at typical laser pulse lengths of 0.1 to 1 ps, the laser damage fluences for robust dielectric materials correspond to peak surface electric fields in the GV/m regime. The corresponding accelerating field enhancement represents a potential reduction in active length of the accelerator between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude. Power sources for DLA-based accelerators (lasers) are less costly than microwave sources (klystrons) for equivalent average power levels due to wider availability and private sector investment. Because of the high laser-to-particle coupling efficiency, required pulse energies are consistent with tabletop microJoule class lasers. Combined with the very high (MHz) repetition rates these lasers can provide, the DLA approach appears promising for a variety of applications, including future high-energy physics colliders, compact light sources, and portable medical scanners and radiative therapy machines.}

For the latter case, we show that the unfiltered statistical distribution can still exhibit a long-tail, but the extreme-events in this case correspond to collisions between solitons of different frequencies.

Highly parallelized, fast and scalable hardware is therefore becoming progressively more important2. Here we demonstrate a computationally specific integrated photonic hardware accelerator (tensor core) that is capable of operating at speeds of trillions of multiply-accumulate operations per second (1012 MAC operations per second or tera-MACs per second). The tensor core can be considered as the optical analogue of an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). It achieves parallelized photonic in-memory computing using phase-change-material memory arrays and photonic chip-based optical frequency combs (soliton microcombs3). The computation is reduced to measuring the optical transmission of reconfigurable and non-resonant passive components and can operate at a bandwidth exceeding 14 gigahertz, limited only by the speed of the modulators and photodetectors. Given recent advances in hybrid integration of soliton microcombs at microwave line rates3\textendash 5, ultralow-loss silicon nitride waveguides6,7, and high-speed on-chip detectors and modulators, our approach provides a path towards full complementary metal\textendash oxide\textendash semiconductor (CMOS) wafer-scale integration of the photonic tensor core. Although we focus on convolutional processing, more generally our results indicate the potential of integrated photonics for parallel, fast, and efficient computational hardware in data-heavy AI applications such as autonomous driving, live video processing, and next-generation cloud computing services.},

We take advantage of a femtosecond temporal gating of the electron pulse mediated by an infrared laser pulse, and exploit the sensitivity of inelastic electron-light scattering to changes in the material dielectric function.

Due to the high versatility and sensitivity of the electron probe, our method would allow capturing the electronic dynamics of a wide range of nanoscale materials with ultimate spatiotemporal resolution.},

In this context, attosecond electron compression has been recently demonstrated through interaction with the near fields created by scattering of ultrashort laser pulses at nanostructures followed by free-electron propagation. Here, we show that control over electron pulse shaping, compression, and statistics can be improved by replacing coherent laser excitation by interaction with quantum light. We find that compression is accelerated for fixed optical intensity by using phase-squeezed light, while amplitude squeezing produces ultrashort double-pulse profiles. The generated electron pulses exhibit periodic revivals in complete analogy to the optical Talbot effect. We further reveal that the coherences created in a sample by interaction with the modulated electron are strongly dependent on the statistics of the modulating light, while the diagonal part of the sample density matrix reduces to a Poissonian distribution regardless of the type of light used to shape the electron. The present study opens a new direction toward the generation of free-electron pulses with additional control over duration, shape, and statistics, which directly affect their interaction with a sample.},

Electron microscopes currently offer the unparalleled ability of rendering spatially resolved electron spectra with combined meV and sub-nm resolution, while the use of ultrafast optical pulses enables fs temporal resolution and exposure of the electrons to ultraintense confined optical fields. Here, we theoretically investigate fundamental aspects of the interaction of fast electrons with localized optical modes that are made possible by these advances. We use a quantum optics description of the optical field to predict that the resulting electron spectra strongly depend on the statistics of the sample excitations (bosonic or fermionic) and their population (Fock, coherent, or thermal), whose autocorrelation functions are directly retrieved from the ratios of electron gain intensities. We further explore feasible experimental scenarios to probe the quantum characteristics of the sampled excitations and their populations. In particular, we present realistic simulations for electron beams interacting with optical cavities infiltrated with optically pumped quantum emitters, which we show to undergo a varied temporal evolution in the cavity mode statistics that causes radical modifications in the transmitted electron spectra depending on pump-electron delay.},

In particular, squeezed vacuum was applied to the German-British detector GEO 600 during a period of three months from June to August 2011, when GEO 600 was performing an observational run together with the French-Italian Virgo detector. In a second period, the squeezing application continued for about 11 months from November 2011 to October 2012. During this time, squeezed vacuum was applied for 90.2\% (205.2 days total) of the time that science-quality data were acquired with GEO 600. A sensitivity increase from squeezed vacuum application was observed broadband above 400 Hz. The time average of gain in sensitivity was 26\% (2.0 dB), determined in the frequency band from 3.7 to 4.0 kHz. This corresponds to a factor of 2 increase in the observed volume of the Universe for sources in the kHz region (e.g., supernovae, magnetars). We introduce three new techniques to enable the long-term application of squeezed light, and show that the glitch rate of the detector did not increase from squeezing application. Squeezed vacuum states of light have arrived as a permanent application, capable of increasing the astrophysical reach of gravitational-wave detectors.}

  abstract = {A study is made of frequency-comb generation described by the driven and damped nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation on a finite interval. It is shown that frequency-comb generation can be interpreted as a modulational instability of the continuous-wave pump mode, and a linear stability analysis, taking into account the cavity boundary conditions, is performed. Further, a truncated three-wave model is derived, which allows one to gain additional insight into the dynamical behavior of the comb generation. This formalism describes the pump mode and the most unstable sideband and is found to connect the coupled mode theory with the conventional theory of modulational instability. An in-depth analysis is done of the nonlinear three-wave model. It is demonstrated that stable frequency-comb states can be interpreted as attractive fixed points of a dynamical system. The possibility of soft and hard excitation states in both the normal and the anomalous dispersion regime is discussed. Investigations are made of bistable comb states and the dependence of the final state on the way the comb has been generated. The analytical predictions are verified by means of direct comparison with numerical simulations of the full equation and the agreement is discussed.}

The high-finesse (Q0~{$\approx~$}106) cavity enhancement and a waveguide designed for phase matching lead to efficient electron\textendash light scattering at extremely low, continuous-wave optical powers.

The solitons were generated spontaneously when the laser frequency was tuned through the effective zero detuning point of a high-Q resonance, which led to an effective red-detuned pumping. Transition to soliton states were characterized by discontinuous steps in the resonator transmission. The solitons were stable in the long term and their number could be controlled via pump-laser detuning. These observations are in agreement with numerical simulations and soliton theory. Operating in the single-soliton regime allows the continuous output coupling of a femtosecond pulse train directly from the microresonator. This approach enables ultrashort pulse syntheses in spectral regimes in which broadband laser-gain media and saturable absorbers are not available. In the frequency domain the single-soliton states correspond to low-noise optical frequency combs with smooth spectral envelopes, critical to applications in broadband spectroscopy, telecommunications, astronomy and low noise microwave generation.},

The new class of Kerr-frequency comb sources, based on parametric frequency conversion in optical microresonators, can complement conventional systems in applications requiring high repetition rates such as direct comb spectroscopy, spectrometer calibration, arbitrary optical waveform generation and advanced telecommunications. However, a severe limitation in experiments working towards practical systems is phase noise, observed in the form of linewidth broadening, multiple repetition-rate beat notes and loss of temporal coherence. These phenomena are not explained by the current theory of Kerr comb formation, yet understanding this is crucial to the maturation of Kerr comb technology. Here, based on observations in crystalline MgF2 and planar Si3N4 microresonators, we reveal the universal, platform-independent dynamics of Kerr comb formation, allowing the explanation of a wide range of phenomena not previously understood, as well as identifying the condition for, and transition to, low-phase-noise performance.},

The system, for which a Lyapunov function is required, is assumed to have a property called dissipativeness. Roughly speaking, this means that the system absorbs more energy from the external world than it supplies. Different types of dissipativeness can be considered depending on how one chooses to define "power input." Dissipativeness is shown to be characterized by the existence of a computable function which can be interpreted as the "stored energy" of the system. Under certain conditions, this energy function is a Lyapunov function which establishes stability, and in some cases asymptotic stability, of the isolated system.},

Destabilization of Turing patterns and the transition to spatiotemporal chaos, however, limit the available energy carried in the Turing rolls and prevent further harvest of their high coherence and robustness to noise. Here, we report a novel scheme to circumvent such destabilization, by incorporating the effect of local mode hybridizations, and we attain globally stable Turing pattern formation in chip-scale nonlinear oscillators with significantly enlarged parameter space, achieving a record-high power-conversion efficiency of 45\% and an elevated peak-to-valley contrast of 100. The stationary Turing pattern is discretely tunable across 430 GHz on a THz carrier, with a fractional frequency sideband nonuniformity measured at 7.3\texttimes 10-14. We demonstrate the simultaneous microwave and optical coherence of the Turing rolls at different evolution stages through ultrafast optical correlation techniques. The free-running Turing-roll coherence, 9 kHz in 200 ms and 160 kHz in 20 minutes, is transferred onto a plasmonic photomixer for one of the highest-power THz coherent generations at room temperature, with 1.1\% optical-to-THz power conversion. Its long-term stability can be further improved by more than 2 orders of magnitude, reaching an Allan deviation of 6\texttimes 10-10 at 100 s, with a simple computer-aided slow feedback control. The demonstrated on-chip coherent high-power Turing-THz system is promising to find applications in astrophysics, medical imaging, and wireless communications.}

They are promising for a number of applications ranging from optical coherent communications to astrophysical spectrometer calibration, and are also of fundamental interest to the physical sciences. Dissipative Kerr solitons can form a variety of stable states, including breathers and multiple-soliton formations. Among these states, soliton crystals stand out: temporally ordered ensembles of soliton pulses, which are regularly arranged by a modulation of the continuous-wave intracavity driving field. To date, however, the dynamics of soliton crystals and their defect-free generation remain unexplored. Here, we show that the chaotic operating regimes of driven optical microresonators significantly impact the dynamics of soliton crystals. We realize deterministic generation of perfect soliton crystal states, which correspond to a stable, defect-free lattice of intracavity optical pulses. We reveal a critical pump power, below which the stochastic process of soliton excitation abruptly becomes deterministic, which enables faultless, device-independent access to perfect soliton crystals. We also demonstrate the switching of these states and its relation to the regime of transient chaos. Finally, we report on other dynamical phenomena observed in soliton crystals including the formation of breathers, transitions between perfect soliton crystals, their melting and recrystallization.},

Over the past decade, the manipulation and interaction of electrons with optical fields have enabled considerable progress in imaging methods4, near-field electron acceleration5,6, and four-dimensional microscopy techniques with high temporal and spatial resolution7. However, electron beams typically couple only weakly to optical excitations, and emerging applications in electron control and sensing8\textendash 11 require large enhancements using tailored fields and interactions. Here we couple a free-electron beam to a travelling-wave resonant cavity mode. The enhanced interaction with the optical whispering-gallery modes of dielectric microresonators induces a strong phase modulation on co-propagating electrons, which leads to a spectral broadening of 700 electronvolts, corresponding to the absorption and emission of hundreds of photons. By mapping the near-field interaction with ultrashort electron pulses in space and time, we trace the lifetime of the the microresonator following a femtosecond excitation and observe the spectral response of the cavity. The natural matching of free electrons to these quintessential optical modes could enable the application of integrated photonics technology in electron microscopy, with broad implications for attosecond structuring, probing quantum emitters and possible electron\textendash light entanglement.},

Here, we demonstrate that PINEM can locally and quantitatively probe the nonlinear optical response. Specifically, we predict a dependence of PINEM electron spectra on the sample nonlinearity that can reveal the second-harmonic (SH) response of optical materials with nanometer resolution, observed through asymmetries between electron energy losses and gains. We illustrate this concept by showing that PINEM spectra are sensitive to the SH near field of centrosymmetric structures and by finding substantial spectral asymmetries in geometries for which the linear interaction is reduced.}

  abstract = {Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in the electron microscope has progressed remarkably in the last five years. Advances in monochromator and spectrometer design have improved the energy resolution attainable in a scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to 4.2~meV, and new applications of ultrahigh energy resolution EELS have not lagged behind. They include vibrational spectroscopy in the electron microscope, a field that did not exist 5~years ago but has now grown very substantially. Notable examples include vibrational mapping with about 1\,nm spatial resolution, analyzing the momentum dependence of vibrational states in very small volumes, determining the local temperature of the sample from the ratio of energy gains to energy losses, detecting hydrogen and analyzing its bonding, probing radiation-sensitive materials with minimized damage by aloof spectroscopy and leap-frog scanning, and identifying biological molecules with different isotopic substitutions. We review the instrumentation advances, provide a summary of key applications, and chart likely future directions.},

Apart from shape-invariant stationary solitons, these systems can support breathing dissipative solitons exhibiting a periodic oscillatory behaviour. Here, we generate and study single and multiple breathing solitons in coherently driven microresonators. We present a deterministic route to induce soliton breathing, allowing a detailed exploration of the breathing dynamics in two microresonator platforms. We measure the relation between the breathing frequency and two control parameters\textemdash pump laser power and effective-detuning\textemdash and observe transitions to higher periodicity, irregular oscillations and switching, in agreement with numerical predictions. Using a fast detection, we directly observe the spatiotemporal dynamics of individual solitons, which provides evidence of breather synchronisation.},

Over the past decade, shaping methods evolved from static phase plates to low-speed electrostatic and magnetostatic displays. Recently, a swift change of paradigm utilizing light to control free electrons has emerged. Here, we experimentally demonstrate arbitrary transverse modulation of electron beams without complicated electron-optics elements or material nanostructures, but rather using shaped light beams. On-demand spatial modulation of electron wavepackets is obtained via inelastic interaction with transversely shaped ultrafast light fields controlled by an external spatial light modulator. We illustrate this method for the cases of Hermite-Gaussian and Laguerre-Gaussian modulation and discuss their use in enhancing microscope sensitivity. Our approach dramatically widens the range of patterns that can be imprinted on the electron profile and greatly facilitates tailored electron-beam shaping.}

  abstract = {On-chip optical waveguides with low propagation losses and precisely engineered group velocity dispersion are important to nonlinear photonic devices such as soliton microcombs, and likewise can be employed for on-chip gyroscopes, delay lines, or Brillouin lasers. Yet, despite intensive research efforts, nonlinear integrated photonic platforms still feature propagation losses orders of magnitude higher than in standard optical fiber. The tight confinement and high index contrast of integrated waveguides make them highly susceptible to fabrication-induced surface roughness, causing dominant scattering losses. Therefore, microresonators with ultra-high-Q-factors are, to date, attainable only in polished bulk crystalline or chemically etched silica-based devices, which pose, however, challenges for full photonic integration. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of silicon nitride (Si3N4) waveguides with unprecedentedly smooth sidewalls and tight confinement with record-low propagation losses. This is achieved by combining the photonic Damascene process with a novel reflow process, which reduces etching roughness, while sufficiently preserving dimensional accuracy. This leads to previously unattainable mean scattering Q-factors of 12\&\#x00D7;106 for tightly confining waveguides with anomalous dispersion. Via systematic process step variation and two independent characterization techniques, we differentiate the scattering and absorption loss contributions and reveal metal-impurity-related absorption to be an important loss origin. Although such impurities are known to limit optical fibers, this is the first time, to the best of our knowledge, they are identified\&\#x2014;and play a tangible role\&\#x2014;in absorption of integrated microresonators. Taken together, our work provides new insights into the origins of propagation losses in Si3N4 waveguides and provides the technological basis for integrated nonlinear photonics in the ultra-high-Q regime.},

The probability of these events depends on the noise filtered frequency and grows up when the noise amplitude increases. The probability distribution of spike amplitudes confirms the rogue wave character of the observed phenomenon. The results of numerical simulations are in good agreement with experiments.}

The leading candidate technology is silicon photonics, and the workhorse of such an interconnect is the optical modulator. Modulators have been improved dramatically in recent years, with a notable increase in bandwidth from the megahertz to the multigigahertz regime in just over half a decade. However, the demands of optical interconnects are significant, and many questions remain unanswered as to whether silicon can meet the required performance metrics. Minimizing metrics such as the device footprint and energy requirement per bit, while also maximizing bandwidth and modulation depth, is non-trivial. All of this must be achieved within an acceptable thermal tolerance and optical spectral width using CMOS-compatible fabrication processes. This Review discusses the techniques that have been (and will continue to be) used to implement silicon optical modulators, as well as providing an outlook for these devices and the candidate solutions of the future.},

FMCW lidar maps distance to frequency4,5 using frequency-chirped waveforms and simultaneously measures the Doppler shift of the~reflected laser~light, similar to sonar or radar6,7 and coherent detection prevents interference from sunlight and other lidar systems. However, coherent ranging has a lower acquisition speed and requires precisely chirped8 and highly coherent5 laser sources, hindering widespread use of the lidar system and impeding parallelization, compared to modern time-of-flight ranging systems that use arrays of individual lasers.

By fast chirping~of the pump laser in the soliton~existence range10 of a microcomb with amplitudes of up to several gigahertz and a sweep rate of up to ten megahertz, a rapid frequency change occurs in the underlying carrier waveform of the soliton pulse stream, but the pulse-to-pulse repetition rate of the soliton pulse stream is retained. As a result, the chirp from a single narrow-linewidth pump laser is transferred to all spectral comb teeth of the soliton at once, thus enabling parallelism in the FMCW lidar. Using this approach we generate 30 distinct channels, demonstrating both parallel distance and velocity measurements at an equivalent rate of three megapixels per second, with the potential to improve sampling rates beyond 150 megapixels per second and to increase the image refresh rate of the FMCW lidar by up to two orders of magnitude without deterioration of eye safety. This approach, when combined with photonic phase arrays11 based on nanophotonic gratings12, provides a technological basis for compact, massively parallel and ultrahigh-frame-rate coherent lidar systems.},

  abstract = {Extracting light from silicon is a longstanding challenge in modern engineering and physics. While silicon has underpinned the past 70 years of electronics advancement, a facile tunable and efficient silicon-based light source remains elusive. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the generation of tunable radiation from a one-dimensional, all-silicon nanograting. Light is generated by the spontaneous emission from the interaction of these nanogratings with low-energy free electrons (2\textendash 20\,keV) and is recorded in the wavelength range of 800\textendash 1600\,nm, which includes the silicon transparency window. Tunable free-electron-based light generation from nanoscale silicon gratings with efficiencies approaching those from metallic gratings is demonstrated. We theoretically investigate the feasibility of a scalable, compact, all-silicon tunable light source comprised of a silicon Field Emitter Array integrated with a silicon nanograting that emits at telecommunication wavelengths. Our results reveal the prospects of a CMOS-compatible electrically-pumped silicon light source for possible applications in the mid-infrared and telecommunication wavelengths.},

In the first interaction region (the modulator), an energy modulation is imprinted on the electron pulse. During free propagation, this energy modulation evolves into a charge density modulation, which we probe in the second interaction region (the analyzer).

Here, we systematically investigate electron-light interactions from first principles. We show that enhanced coupling can be achieved for systems involving slow electron wave packets interacting with plasmonic nanoparticles, due to simultaneous classical recoil and quantum mechanical photon absorption and emission processes. For slow electrons with longitudinal broadenings longer than the dimensions of nanoparticles, phase matching between slow electrons and plasmonic oscillations is manifested as an additional degree of freedom to control the strength of coupling. Our findings pave the way toward a systematic and realistic understanding of electron-light interactions beyond adiabatic approximations, and lay the ground for the realization of matter-wave interferometry and boson-sampling devices involving light and matter waves.}

This method offers a high degree of scalability to small length scales and a highly efficient manipulation of the electron vorticity with attosecond precision. Besides the direct implications in the investigation of nanoscale ultrafast processes in which chirality plays a major role, we further discuss the perspectives of using this technique to shape the wavefunction of charged composite particles, such as protons, and how it can be used to probe their internal structure.},

So far, studies of the interactions of cavity-confined light with quantum matter have focused on bound electron systems, such as atoms, quantum dots and quantum circuits, which are considerably limited by their fixed energy states, spectral range and selection rules. By contrast, quantum free-electron wavepackets have no such limits, but so far no experiment has shown the influence of a photonic cavity on quantum free-electron wavepackets. Here we develop a platform for multidimensional nanoscale imaging and spectroscopy of free-electron interactions with photonic cavities. We directly measure the cavity-photon lifetime via a coherent free-electron probe and observe an enhancement of more than an order of magnitude in the interaction strength relative to previous experiments of electron\textendash photon interactions. Our free-electron probe resolves the spatiotemporal and energy\textendash momentum information of the interaction. The quantum nature of the electrons is verified by spatially mapping Rabi oscillations of the electron spectrum. The interactions between free electrons and cavity photons could enable low-dose, ultrafast electron microscopy of soft matter or other beam-sensitive materials. Such interactions may also open paths towards using free electrons for quantum information processing and quantum sensing. Future studies could achieve free-electron strong coupling6,7, photon quantum state synthesis8 and quantum nonlinear phenomena such as cavity electro-optomechanics9.},

The interplay between a multimode parametric instability and intrinsic optical bistability leads to a sharp spike in the value of second-order coherence g(2)(0) of the emitted light, which we attribute to the strongly superlinear kinetics of the underlying scattering processes driving the formation of patterns.
