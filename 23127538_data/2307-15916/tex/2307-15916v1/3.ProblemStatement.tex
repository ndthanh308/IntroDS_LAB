\section{Problem Formulation}
\begin{defn}(Air Quality Forecasting). Given an air quality sensor network $G=\mathcal{\{V, E\}}$, where $\mathcal{V}=\{v_1, ..., v_N\}$ is a set of $N$ sensor nodes/stations and $\mathcal{E}=\{e_1, ..., e_E\}$ is a set of $E$ edges connecting the nodes, the air quality data $\{AQI_{t}\}_{t=1}^{T}$ and meteorological data $\{M_{t}\}_{t=1}^{T}$ are collected over the $N$ stations, where $T$ is current timestamp. We aim to build a model $f$ to predict the $AQI$ over the next $T_p$ timestamps.
\end{defn}

To simplify, we denote input data as $\mathcal{X}$= $\{AQI_{t}, M_{t}\}_{t=1}^{T}$
= $\{x_t\}_{t=1}^{T}\in \mathbb{R}^{N \times F \times T }$. %which can be represented as a multivariate time series on a sensor network. 
Each node contains $F$ features representing $PM_{2.5}$, $PM_{10}$, humidity, temperature, etc. As $PM_{2.5}$ is \textit{most reported and most difficult-to-predict}~\cite{yi2018deep}, we take $PM_{2.5}$ as the AQI prediction target $\mathcal{Y}$=$\{y_t\}_{t = T+1}^{T+T_{p}} \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times T_{p}}$. 
%We use $\mathbf{X}_{t}=(\textbf{x}_{t}^{1},...,\textbf{x}_{t}^{N}) \in \mathbb{R}^{N \times F}$ denotes the observations at time $t$, where $\textbf{x}_t^{i}\in \mathbb{R}^{F}$ is the $i$-th variable of $X_t$.


\begin{defn}(Expanded Sensor Network). Given a sensor network at $\tau$: $G_{\tau}$ = $\{\mathcal{V}_{\tau}, \mathcal{E}_{\tau}\}$ with $N_{\tau}$ sensors, the network at $\tau'$: $G_{\tau'}$=$G_{\tau}$+$\Delta G_{\tau}$ = $\{V_{\tau'}, E_{\tau'}\}$ expands $G_{\tau}$ to $N_{\tau'}$ sensors. 
\end{defn}

% Can be simplified to TWO datasets with different sensor networks: it's OPTIONAL to have the training data on new sensor work, but the inference should be done over data collected from the new sensor network. 
% TODO: to improve the definition of training dataset, try to include the instance number and the definition of \tau.  
We aim to build a model $f$, which is firstly trained over a dataset $\{\mathcal{X}_{\tau}\}$ on a sensor network $G_{\tau}$ = $\{\mathcal{V}_{\tau}, \mathcal{E}_{\tau}\}$, and can be incrementally trained over $\{\mathcal{X}_{\tau'}\}$ on an expanded network $G_{\tau'}$. 
% several cases for inference
For inference, given a sequence $\mathcal{X} \in \mathbb{R}^{N_{\tau'} \times F \times T}$ and a sensor network $G_{\tau'}$, the model $f$ can predict the $AQI$ for the next $T_{p}$ time steps $\mathcal{Y}$=$\{y_t\}_{t = T+1}^{T+T_{p}} \in \mathbb{R}^{N\times T_{p}}$, where $N_{\tau'} \geq N_{\tau}$. 
%When $N_{\tau'} > N_{\tau}$, the model $f$ can predict the $AQI$ of any specific areas, without feeding the area's data for training.
