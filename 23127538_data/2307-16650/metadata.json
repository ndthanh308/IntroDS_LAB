  "abstract": "ChatGPT, an implementation and application of large language models, has gained significant popularity since its initial release. Researchers have been exploring ways to harness the practical benefits of ChatGPT in real-world scenarios. Educational researchers have investigated its potential in various subjects, e.g., programming, mathematics, finance, clinical decision support, etc. However, there has been limited attention given to its application in data science education. This paper aims to bridge that gap by utilizing ChatGPT in a data science course, gathering perspectives from students, and presenting our experiences and feedback on using ChatGPT for teaching and learning in data science education. The findings not only distinguish data science education from other disciplines but also uncover new opportunities and challenges associated with incorporating ChatGPT into the data science curriculum.",
