In the realm of deep learning, ensuring stability and efficiency is crucial, especially when addressing challenges like numerical instability. Our research introduces an innovative strategy that significantly enhances the stability of neural networks during their training phase. By modifying the gradient update mechanism in the Adam optimizer, we have effectively mitigated instability issues prevalent in 16-bit neural network training.

Our empirical evaluations, which included the MNIST dataset with a basic Deep Neural Network (DNN), the CIFAR-10 dataset with Vision Transformers (ViTs), and ResNet models, have demonstrated the robustness of our modified optimizer. In a 16-bit training environment, it consistently outperformed the traditional Adam setup. Notably, our approach reduced training times by approximately 45\% for DNNs, 26.3\% for ViTs, and 28.4\% for ResNet models compared to their 32-bit counterparts, while maintaining enhanced stability across various epsilon values.

However, our investigations have primarily focused on image classification tasks using Linear DNNs, ViTs, and ResNets. In future research, we aim to broaden our scope to assess the stability and efficiency of our strategy across a more diverse range of complex architectures and tasks, including Natural Language Processing (NLP). Our ultimate goal is to develop a comprehensive solution to combat numerical instability in deep learning. We are confident that our current contributions lay a strong foundation for future advancements in creating more stable and efficient deep learning models.
