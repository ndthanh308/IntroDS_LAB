TODO's

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Add section about CCE and Nash equilibrium, talk about properties of each of these and how they differ. Differences between discrete and continuous equilibria. See if we can discuss anything about CCE. See if we can say that all CCE that algorithms exhibit are also Nash equilibria, see if we have monotonicity, see what implications there are on revenue/welfare. See what aspects of the auction the auctioneer could change in order to improve revenue or reduce bid shading; i.e. reserve prices or randomize the supply
    \item Construct simulations using first synthetic data and then real world data afterwards
    \item Generalize active arm elimination as per Yanjun Han's paper
    \item Consider different feedback structure with the published clearing price
    \item Try different arm estimator, perhaps adding uniform exploration
\end{enumerate}
