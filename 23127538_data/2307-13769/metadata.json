  "abstract": "We solve explicitly a certain minimization problem for probability measures involving an interaction energy that is repulsive at short distances and attractive at large distances. We complement earlier works by showing that part of the remaining parameter regime all minimizers are uniform distributions on a surface of a sphere, thus showing concentration on a lower dimensional set. Our method of proof uses convexity estimates on hypergeometric functions.",
