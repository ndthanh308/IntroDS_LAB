\section{Conclusion}
We have proposed an effective methodology for training depth estimation networks to deal with transparent and mirror surfaces. By in-painting these surfaces on RGB images, we can quickly annotate a dataset with virtual depth labels, that can be used to fine-tune both monocular and stereo networks, with outstanding results.
% In the future, we aim at extending our work by training monocular and stereo depth estimation networks capable of superior generalization in-the-wild, while estimating a reliable depth for ToM surfaces. 
% To do so, we need a larger dataset containing these kinds of objects in many environments, and possibly a more robust segmentation network to ease the burden of collecting pixel-wise semantic annotations. 
% In this regard, larger datasets featuring these objects and more robust segmentation networks capable of generalizing are necessary.
A promising future direction would be to extend our technique to instance segmentation masks to get better virtual depth maps in the presence of multiple ToM objects in the same scene.
