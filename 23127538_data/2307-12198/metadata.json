  "abstract": "Deep learning models have become popular in the analysis of tabular data, as they address the limitations of decision trees and enable valuable applications like semi-supervised learning, online learning, and transfer learning. However, these deep-learning approaches often encounter a trade-off. On one hand, they can be computationally expensive when dealing with large-scale or high-dimensional datasets. On the other hand, they may lack interpretability and may not be suitable for small-scale datasets. In this study, we propose a novel interpretable neural network called Neural Classification and Regression Tree (NCART) to overcome these challenges. NCART is a modified version of Residual Networks that replaces fully-connected layers with multiple differentiable oblivious decision trees. By integrating decision trees into the architecture, NCART maintains its interpretability while benefiting from the end-to-end capabilities of neural networks. The simplicity of the NCART architecture makes it well-suited for datasets of varying sizes and reduces computational costs compared to state-of-the-art deep learning models. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of NCART compared to existing deep learning models, establishing it as a strong competitor to tree-based models.",
