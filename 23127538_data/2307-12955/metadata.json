  "abstract": "In this short note, we prove equidistribution results regarding three families of three-colour partitions recently introduced by Schlosser and Zhou. To do so, we prove an asymptotic formula for the infinite product $F_{a,c}(ζ; {\\rm e}^{-z}) := \\prod_{n \\geq 0} \\big(1- ζ{\\rm e}^{-(a+cn)z}\\big)$ ($a,c \\in \\mathbb{N}$ with $0<a\\leq c$ and $ζ$ a root of unity) when $z$ lies in certain sectors in the right half-plane, which may be useful in studying similar problems. As a corollary, we obtain the asymptotic behaviour of the three-colour partition families at hand.",
