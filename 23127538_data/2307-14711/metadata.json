  "abstract": "Phase reduction is a general approach to describe coupled oscillatory units in terms of their phases, assuming that the amplitudes are enslaved. For such a reduction, the coupling should be small, but one also expects the reduction to be valid for finite coupling. This paper presents a general framework allowing us to obtain coupling terms in higher orders of the coupling parameter for generic two-dimensional oscillators and arbitrary coupling terms. The theory is illustrated with an accurate prediction of Arnold's tongue for the van der Pol oscillator exploiting higher-order phase reduction.",
