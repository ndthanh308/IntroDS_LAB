\section*{Usage Notes}
The AutoPET dataset~\cite{gatidis2022whole} contains three different image types for each examination: The PET and the corresponding SUV, the tumor segmentation mask, and two different CT images. One of them is in the original resolution whereas the second one is resampled to match the PET/SUV resolution. DAP Atlas is based on the original CT image resolution, however, resampling of the masks can be performed to match the PET resolution for future multimodel PET/CT work. 

\section*{Code availability}

The code for the dataset aggregation and for the post-processing will be made publicly available under \href{https://github.com/alexanderjaus/AtlasDataset}{github}. 
Besides the dataset, we publish the trained models V1 as well as the robust model V2 at \href{https://github.com/alexanderjaus/AtlasDataset}{github}. 

\section*{Conflicts of Interest}
The authors disclose no conflicts of interest.

\section*{Informed Consent Statement:}
The DAP Atlas uses a subset of the AutoPET dataset. As the AutoPET dataset was part of a public competition, ethical approval from our side was not required, as confirmed by the license attached with the open-access data. 
\bibliography{main}

%\noindent LaTeX formats citations and references automatically using the bibliography records in your .bib file, which you can edit via the project menu. Use the cite command for an inline citation, e.g. \cite{Kaufman2020, Figueredo:2009dg, Babichev2002, behringer2014manipulating}. For data citations of datasets uploaded to e.g. \emph{figshare}, please use the \verb|howpublished| option in the bib entry to specify the platform and the link, as in the \verb|Hao:gidmaps:2014| example in the sample bibliography file. For journal articles, DOIs should be included for works in press that do not yet have volume or page numbers. For other journal articles, DOIs should be included uniformly for all articles or not at all. We recommend that you encode all DOIs in your bibtex database as full URLs, e.g. https://doi.org/10.1007/s12110-009-9068-2.

%Must include all authors, identified by initials, for example:
%A.A. conceived the experiment(s), A.A. and B.A. conducted the experiment(s), C.A. and D.A. analysed the results. All authors reviewed the manuscript. 

%\section*{Competing interests} (mandatory statement)

%The corresponding author is responsible for providing a \href{https://www.nature.com/sdata/policies/editorial-and-publishing-policies#competing}{competing interests statement} on behalf of all authors of the paper. This statement must be included in the submitted article file.

%\section*{Figures \& Tables}

%Figures, tables, and their legends, should be included at the end of the document. Figures and tables can be referenced in \LaTeX{} using the ref command, e.g. Figure \ref{fig:stream} and Table \ref{tab:example}. 

%Authors are encouraged to provide one or more tables that provide basic information on the main ‘inputs’ to the study (e.g. samples, participants, or information sources) and the main data outputs of the study. Tables in the manuscript should generally not be used to present primary data (i.e. measurements). Tables containing primary data should be submitted to an appropriate data repository.

%Tables may be provided within the \LaTeX{} document or as separate files (tab-delimited text or Excel files). Legends, where needed, should be included here. Generally, a Data Descriptor should have fewer than ten Tables, but more may be allowed when needed. Tables may be of any size, but only Tables which fit onto a single printed page will be included in the PDF version of the article (up to a maximum of three). 

%Due to typesetting constraints, tables that do not fit onto a single A4 page cannot be included in the PDF version of the article and will be made available in the online version only. Any such tables must be labelled in the text as ‘Online-only’ tables and numbered separately from the main table list e.g. ‘Table 1, Table 2, Online-only Table 1’ etc.
