  "abstract": "Armoured vehicles are specialized and complex pieces of machinery designed to operate in high-stress environments, often in combat or tactical situations. This study proposes a predictive maintenance-based ensemble system that aids in predicting potential maintenance needs based on sensor data collected from these vehicles. The proposed model's architecture involves various models such as Light Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Extra Tree Classifier and Gradient Boosting to predict the maintenance requirements of the vehicles accurately. In addition, K-fold cross validation, along with TOPSIS analysis, is employed to evaluate the proposed ensemble model's stability. The results indicate that the proposed system achieves an accuracy of 98.93%, precision of 99.80% and recall of 99.03%. The algorithm can effectively predict maintenance needs, thereby reducing vehicle downtime and improving operational efficiency. Through comparisons between various algorithms and the suggested ensemble, this study highlights the potential of machine learning-based predictive maintenance solutions.",
