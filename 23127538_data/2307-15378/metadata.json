  "abstract": "In this paper, we present a new proposal on how to measure quark/gluon jet properties at the LHC. The measurement strategy takes advantage of the fact that the LHC has collected data at different energies. Measurements at two or more energies can be combined to yield distributions of any jet property separated into quark and gluon jet samples on a statistical basis, without the need for an independent event-by-event tag. We illustrate our method with a variety of different angularity observables, and discuss how to narrow down the search for the most useful observables.",
