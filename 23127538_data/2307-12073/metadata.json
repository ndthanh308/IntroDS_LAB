  "abstract": "Domination and coloring are two classic problems in graph theory. The major focus of this paper is the CD-COLORING problem which combines the flavours of domination and colouring. Let $G$ be an undirected graph. A proper vertex coloring of $G$ is a $cd-coloring$ if each color class has a dominating vertex in $G$. The minimum integer $k$ for which there exists a $cd-coloring$ of $G$ using $k$ colors is called the cd-chromatic number, $χ_{cd}(G)$. A set $S\\subseteq V(G)$ is a total dominating set if any vertex in $G$ has a neighbor in $S$. The total domination number, $γ_t(G)$ of $G$ is the minimum integer $k$ such that $G$ has a total dominating set of size $k$. A set $S\\subseteq V(G)$ is a $separated-cluster$ if no two vertices in $S$ lie at a distance 2 in $G$. The separated-cluster number, $ω_s(G)$, of $G$ is the maximum integer $k$ such that $G$ has a separated-cluster of size $k$.\n  In this paper, first we explore the connection between CD-COLORING and TOTAL DOMINATION. We prove that CD-COLORING and TOTAL DOMINATION are NP-Complete on triangle-free $d$-regular graphs for each fixed integer $d\\geq 3$. We also study the relationship between the parameters $χ_{cd}(G)$ and $ω_s(G)$. Analogous to the well-known notion of `perfectness', here we introduce the notion of `cd-perfectness'. We prove a sufficient condition for a graph $G$ to be cd-perfect (i.e. $χ_{cd}(H)= ω_s(H)$, for any induced subgraph $H$ of $G$) which is also necessary for certain graph classes (like triangle-free graphs). Here, we propose a generalized framework via which we obtain several exciting consequences in the algorithmic complexities of special graph classes. In addition, we settle an open problem by showing that the SEPARATED-CLUSTER is polynomially solvable for interval graphs.",
