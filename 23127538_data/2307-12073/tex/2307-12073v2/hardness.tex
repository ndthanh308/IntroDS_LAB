\section{Total domination and $cd$-coloring in triangle-free $d$-regular Graphs}
\label{sec:hardness}
In this section, we prove Theorem~\ref{thm:regular}, i.e. we derive the hardness result for \CDC\ in triangle-free $d$-regular graphs for each fixed integer $d\geq 3$. As a corollary of this result, we obtain the hardness result for \TD\ in triangle-free $d$-regular graphs for each fixed integer $d\geq 3$. 
Hence, first, we propose a simple linear reduction for \CDC\ on triangle-free cubic graphs. Then, we generalize this reduction for triangle-free $d$-regular graphs for each fixed integer $d\geq 3$, by using two linear reductions: one for odd values of $d$ and the other for even values.

The Exponential-Time Hypothesis (ETH) along with the Sparsification   Lemma implies that \TSAT\ cannot be solved in subexponential-time, i.e.
in time $2^{o(n+m)}$, where $n$ is 
the number of variables and $m$ is the number of clauses in the input formula.
 To prove that a problem does not admit a subexponential-time algorithm, %(algorithm runs in $2^{o(n)}$ algorithm, where $n$ is the size of input instance), 
 it is sufficient to obtain a linear reduction from a problem 
which does not admit a subexponential time algorithm where a linear reduction is a polynomial-time reduction
in which the size of the resultant instance is linear in the size of the input instance.
We refer to Chapter 14 of the book~\cite{CyganOthParamAlgo} for more details about these concepts.
All reductions mentioned in this section are trivially linear.

To prove Theorem~\ref{thm:regular}, we use three constructions. 
Construction~\ref{cons:cubic} is used for a reduction from \textsc{Total Domination}  on bipartite graphs with bounded degree 3 to \CDC\ on triangle-free cubic graphs. Construction~\ref{cons:d-regular odd} is used for a reduction from \CDC\ on triangle-free $(d-2)$-regular graphs to \CDC\ on triangle-free $d$-regular graphs, for each odd integer $d\geq 5$, whereas the Construction~\ref{cons:d-regular even} is used for a reduction from \CDC\ on triangle-free $(d-1)$-regular graphs to \CDC\ on triangle-free $d$-regular graphs, for each even integer $d\geq 4$. 
\input{cubic}

Now, we generalize  Construction~\ref{cons:cubic} to prove the hardness of \CDC\ on triangle-free $d$-regular graphs, for any constant $d\geq 4$. The following construction is used to prove the hardness of \CDC\ on triangle-free $d$-regular graphs, for any odd integer $d\geq 5$. 
\input{regular}

The following construction is used to prove the hardness of \CDC\ on triangle-free $d$-regular graphs, for any even integer $d\geq 4$.  
\input{regular_even}

\noindent\textit{Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:regular}:} Note that $\mid V(G_{c1})\mid =2n(2d^2-3d+2)$, where $G_{c1}$ is obtained as per construction~\ref{cons:d-regular odd}. Similarly, $\mid V(G_{c2})\mid =n(2d^2-5d+3)$, where $G_{c2}$ is obtained as per construction~\ref{cons:d-regular even}. Hence, both constructions are linear with respect to their size of
inputs, and hence, their associated reductions are also linear. 
Thus, we know that there is a linear reduction from triangle-free $(d-2)$-regular graphs to triangle-free $d$-regular graphs for each fixed odd integer $d\geq 5$ due to Lemma \ref{lem:d-regular odd}. 
We also know that there is a linear reduction from triangle-free $(d-1)$-regular graphs to triangle-free $d$-regular graphs for each fixed even integer $d\geq 4$ due to Lemma \ref{lem:d-regular even}. Therefore, we are done using Proposition~\ref{pro:bipartite} and Theorem~\ref{thm:cubic}. \qed
