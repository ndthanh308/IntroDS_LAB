\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we contribute to the literature connecting the parameters, $\XCD(G)$, \raisebox{2pt}{$\gamma$}$_t(G)$, and $\SC(G)$ of a graph $G$.  Here, we introduce the notion of $cd$-perfectness, and also provide a sufficient condition for a graph to be $cd$-perfect. Even though we also have some necessary conditions for the same, the problem of \textit{characterizing $cd$-perfect graphs} remains open for general graphs. Further, we also prove that \SCP\ is polynomial-time solvable for interval graphs. But, as interval graphs are not necessarily $cd$-perfect, \textit{the algorithmic complexity of \CDC\ on interval graphs} is still open.
