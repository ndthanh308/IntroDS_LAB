\subsection{\large{\textbf{A unified approach for algorithmic complexity on some special graph classes}}}
\label{sec:poly}
Here, we see some implications of our generalized framework of relating the parameters $\XCD(G)$ and $\SC(G)$ of $G$, respectively to the parameters $k(G^*)$ and $\alpha(G^*)$ of $G^*$. In particular, we use Theorem~\ref{thm:suff_cdclique} and Proposition~\ref{pro:omega_s} as tools for deriving both positive and negative results concerning the algorithmic complexity of the problems \CDC\ and \SCP\ on some special classes of graphs. Note that the classes of graphs for which these results are applied to evaluate the time complexity of the problems \CDC\ and \SCP, may not be limited to those studied here.

 \subsubsection{\textbf{Polynomial-time algorithms:}}
 In this section, we will see a unified approach for obtaining polynomial-time algorithms (mostly with an improvement) for some special classes of graphs, using the framework of $cd$-perfectness and the auxiliary graph $G^*$.
