\subsection{A unified approach for algorithmic complexity on some special graph classes}
\label{sec:poly}
Here, we see some implications of our generalized framework of relating $\XCD(G)$ and $\SC(G)$  to $k(G^*)$ and $\alpha(G^*)$, respectively, together with the notion of $cd$-perfectness. In particular, we see the consequences of Theorem~\ref{thm:suff_cdclique} and Proposition~\ref{pro:omega_s}, in deriving both positive and negative results concerning the algorithmic complexity of the problems \CDC\ and \SCP\ on some special classes of graphs. Note that the classes of graphs for which this technique can be applied to find the complexity of \CDC\ and \SCP, may not be limited to the ones studied here.
 \subsubsection{Polynomial-time algorithms}
 In this section, we will see a unified approach for obtaining polynomial-time algorithms (mostly with an improvement) for some special classes of graphs.
