\label{subsec:cdprfect}
Here we introduce the notion of \textit{cd-perfect graphs}, which is defined below.
\begin{definition}[\textit{cd}-perfect graphs]
    An undirected graph $G$ is said to be $cd$-perfect if, for any induced subgraph $H$ of $G$, we have $\XCD(H)=\SC(H)$.
\end{definition}

In this section, we  study $\XCD(G)$ and $\SC(G)$ of a graph $G$, 
by relating them to some well-known graph parameters of the auxiliary graph $G^*$. This simple reduction has various interesting consequences. Recall from Definition~\ref{def:aux} that given a graph $G$, the auxiliary graph $G^*$ is the graph having $V(G^*)=V(G)$ and $E(G^*)=E(G^2)\setminus E(G)$. i.e. $E(G^*)= \{uv:u,v\in V(G)$ and $d_G(u,v)=2\}$. Note that throughout this section, we use the definition that a set $S\subseteq V(G)$ is a \textit{seperated-cluster}, if for any pair of vertices $u,v\in V(G)$, we have $d_G(u,v)\neq 2$.


\medskip

 The following proposition trivially follows from the definition of $G^*$.
\begin{proposition} \label{pro:omega_s}
    For any graph $G$, we have $\SC (G)=\alpha(G^*)$.
\end{proposition}

We then note the observation below.
\begin{observation} \label{obs:cliquecover}
    For any graph $G$, we have $\XCD (G)\geq k(G^*)$
\end{observation}
\begin{proof}
    Let $\XCD(G)=l$, where $I_1,I_2,\ldots, I_l$ denote the corresponding color classes of $G$. Let $j\in \{1,2,\ldots,l\}$. Then by the definition of $cd$- coloring, we have that $I_j$ is an independent set in $G$ and there exists a vertex $v_j\in V(G)$ such that $I_j\subseteq N_G(v_j)$. This implies that for any pair of vertices $u,v\in V(I_j)$, we have $d_G(u,v)=2$. This further implies that $I_j$ is a clique in $G^*$, and therefore $\{I_1,I_2,\ldots, I_l\}$ is a clique cover of $G^*$. Thus we have $\XCD (G)\geq k(G^*)$.
\end{proof}

Note that the reverse inequality of Observation~\ref{obs:cliquecover} is not necessarily true. For instance, consider the graph $C_6$ (an induced cycle on 6 vertices). It is not difficult to verify that $\XCD(C_6)=4$. But as $C_6^*$ is a disjoint union of two triangles, we have that $k(C_6^*)=2<\XCD(C_6)$. In Theorem~\ref{thm:suff_cdclique}, we prove a sufficient condition for a graph $G$ to satisfy the equality in Observation~\ref{obs:cliquecover}. First, we define certain graphs: Consider $C_6$. Since $C_6$ is a bipartite graph, observe that $V(C_6)$ is a disjoint union of two independent sets, say $A$ and $B$, where $|A|=|B|=3$. We denote by $C_6^1$, $C_6^2$, and $C_6^3$, the graphs obtained by respectively adding \textit{1 edge, 2 edges, and 3 edges} to exactly one of the partite sets $A$ or $B$ of $C_6$ (see Figure~\ref{fig:c6-free}). Let $\mathcal{H}=\{C_6, C_6^1$, $C_6^2$, and $C_6^3\}$. First, we note a useful structural observation for graphs in $\mathcal{H}$.
\begin{observation}\label{obs:structureH}
    For each $H\in \mathcal{H}$, we have a set $S\subseteq V(H)$ such that $S$ is independent in $H$ with $|S|=3$. Moreover, the vertices in $S$ form an asteroidal-triple in $H$.
\end{observation}

Now, in the following lemma, we prove a property satisfied by $G^*$, when $G$ is restricted to be an $\mathcal{H}$-free graph. 
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:neighborhood}
Let $G$ be an $\mathcal{H}$-free graph and $G^*$ its corresponding auxiliary graph. Let $K$ be any clique in $G^*$. Then there exists a vertex $v_k\in V(G)$ such that $K\subseteq N_G(v_k)$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We prove this by induction on $|K|$. Consider the base case where $|K|=2$. Let $K=\{x,y\}$. Note that $K$ is a clique in $G^*$. By the definition of $G^*$, $xy\in E(G^*)$ implies that $d_G(x,y)=2$. i.e. there exists a vertex $v_k$ such that $x,y\in N_G(v_k)$. As this proves the base case, we can therefore assume that $|K|\geq 3$. By the induction hypothesis, we can also assume that the condition in the lemma holds for every clique, say $K'$ in $G^*$ with $|K'|<|K|$. Let $x_1,x_2,x_3\in K$ (this is possible, since $|K|\geq 3)$. For $i\in \{1,2,3\}$, let $K_i$ denote the clique $K\setminus \{x_i\}$. By the induction hypothesis, there exists a vertex, say $v_i\in V(G)$, such that $K_i\subseteq N_G(v_i)$. Note that $K$ is an independent set in $G$ (as $K$ is a clique in $G^*$), and therefore $v_i\notin K$ for any $i\in \{1,2,3\}$. Also, in particular, we have $v_ix_j\in E(G)$ for each $i,j\in \{1,2,3\}$, where $i\neq j$. Suppose that $v_ix_i\notin E(G)$ for each $i\in \{1,2,3\}$.  This implies that $v_1$, $v_2$, and $v_3$ are all distinct vertices in $G$. Consider the induced subgraph, $H=G[\{x_1,x_2,x_3,v_1,v_2,v_3\}]$. Since $\{x_1,x_2,x_3\}$ is an independent set in $G$, we then have, 

  $$H=\begin{cases} 
      C_6, & |E(G[\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}]|=0 \\
      C_6^1, & |E(G[\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}]|=1 \\
      C_6^2, & |E(G[\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}]|=2 \\
      C_6^3, & |E(G[\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}]|=3
   \end{cases}
$$
This contradicts the fact that $G$ is $\mathcal{H}$-free. Therefore, we have that $v_ix_i\in E(G)$ for some $i\in \{1,2,3\}$. Then, as $K=K_i\cup\{x_i\}$, the vertex $v_i$ in $G$ has the property that $K\subseteq N_G(v_i)$. This proves the lemma.
\end{proof}
\begin{theorem}\label{thm:suff_cdclique}
Let $G$ be an $\mathcal{H}$-free graph and $G^*$ its corresponding auxiliary graph. Then $\XCD (G)= k(G^*)$
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By Observation~\ref{obs:cliquecover}, here it is enough to show that $\XCD (G)\leq k(G^*)$. Let $k(G^*)=t$, where $K_1,K_2,\ldots, K_t$ denote the corresponding cliques in a minimum clique cover of $G^*$. Since $G$ is $\mathcal{H}$-free, for each $j\in \{1,2,\ldots,t\}$, by Lemma~\ref{lem:neighborhood}, we have that there exists a vertex $v_j\in V(G)$ such that $K_j\subseteq N_G(v_j)$. As each set $K_j$ is an independent set in $G$ (since $K_j$ is a clique in $G^*$), we can now infer that each set $K_j$ is a valid color class for the $cd$-coloring of $G$. Since $V(G)$ is the disjoint union of the sets, $K_1,K_2,\ldots, K_t$, we can therefore conclude that $\XCD (G)\leq k(G^*)$. This proves the theorem.
 \end{proof}
 The following theorem is then immediate from Proposition~\ref{pro:omega_s} and Theorem~\ref{thm:suff_cdclique}. The theorem provides us with a sufficient condition for graphs $G$ to have $\XCD(G)=\SC(G)$.
 \begin{theorem} \label{thm:suff_cdsubclique}
     Let $G$ be an $\mathcal{H}$-free graph and $G^*$ its corresponding auxiliary graph. If $k(G^*)=\alpha(G^*)$ then $\XCD(G)=\SC(G)$. Consequently, if $G$ is $\mathcal{H}$-free and $G^*$ is perfect, then $\XCD(G)=\SC(G)$.
 \end{theorem}
 We then have the following corollary.
 \begin{corollary}\label{corr:suffcdperfect}
     Let $G$ be an $\mathcal{H}$-free graph. If for any induced subgraph $H$ of $G$, we have $k(H^*)=\alpha(H^*)$ then $G$ is $cd$-perfect. Consequently, if $G$ is $\mathcal{H}$-free and $H^*$ is perfect for any induced subgraph $H$ of $G$, then $G$ is $cd$-perfect.
 \end{corollary}
 It is known in the literature that if $G$ is a co-bipartite graph, then $\XCD(G)=\SC(G)$~\cite{DBLP:conf/caldam/ShaluK21}. As a consequence of Theorem~\ref{thm:suff_cdsubclique}, in the following corollary, we now have a simple and shorter proof for the same. 
 \begin{corollary}\label{corr:cobipartite}
    Let $G$ be a co-bipartite graph. Then $G$ is $cd$-perfect. 
\end{corollary}
\begin{proof}
Let $G=(A,B,E)$ be a co-bipartite graph. Since the class of co-bipartite graphs is closed under taking induced subgraphs, to prove the theorem, it is enough to show that  $\XCD(G)=\SC(G)$. Note that $\alpha(G)\leq 2$ (as any independent set in $G$ can have only at most one vertex from each of the sets $A$ and $B$). But for each graph $H\in \mathcal{H}$, we have an independent set of size 3 (by Observation~\ref{obs:structureH}). This implies that $G$ is $\mathcal{H}$-free. Since $G^*$ is a bipartite graph (as $G^*$ is a subgraph of complement of $G$), and therefore perfect, we then have $\XCD(G)=k(G^*)=\alpha(G^*)=\SC(G)$, by Theorem~\ref{thm:suff_cdsubclique}. 
\end{proof}

 \noindent\textbf{Note:}
Consider a graph $H\in \mathcal{H}$. It is not difficult to see that $\XCD(H)=3=\SC(H)$, if $H\neq C_6$, and $\XCD(H)=4>2=\SC(H)$, if $H=C_6$. This is why the sufficient condition for $cd$-perfectness given in Corollary~\ref{corr:suffcdperfect} is not a necessary condition.  To obtain a necessary and sufficient condition, we consider the set $\mathcal{H'}=\{C_6^1,C_6^2,C_6^3\}$. Then, in the following theorem, we have a characterization for  $\mathcal{H'}$-free graphs (a superclass of triangle-free graphs, $3K_1$-free graphs, etc.) to be $cd$-perfect.
 \begin{theorem}
     Let $G$ be an $\mathcal{H'}$-free graph. Then $G$ is $cd$-perfect if and only if $G$ is $C_6$-free and $k(H^*)=\alpha(H^*)$, for each induced subgraph $H$ of $G$. 
 \end{theorem}
 \begin{proof}
Suppose that $G$ is $C_6$ free and $k(H^*)=\alpha(H^*)$, for each induced subgraph $H$ of $G$. Let $H$ be any induced subgraph of $G$. Since $G$ is $\mathcal{H'}$-free and $C_6$-free, we then have $H$ is $\mathcal{H}$-free. Now, as $k(H^*)=\alpha(H^*)$, by Corollary~\ref{corr:suffcdperfect}, we can conclude that $G$ is $cd$-perfect.

\smallskip
On the other hand, assume that $G$ is $cd$-perfect. Clearly, $G$ is $C_6$-free, as otherwise, $C_6$ would be an induced subgraph of $G$ with $\XCD(C_6)=4>2=\SC(C_6)$. Thus we have that $G$ is $\mathcal{H}$-free, and therefore any induced subgraph $H$ of $G$ is also $\mathcal{H}$-free. Then, by Theorem~\ref{thm:suff_cdclique}, we have that $\XCD(H)=k(H^*)$. By Proposition~\ref{pro:omega_s}, we  have $\SC(H)=\alpha(H^*)$. Since $\XCD(H)=\SC(H)$, we then have $k(H^*)=\alpha(H^*)$.
 \end{proof}

Let $C_n$ denote an induced cycle of length $n$. The following observation is noted in~\cite{DBLP:conf/caldam/ShaluVS17}.
\begin{observation}[\cite{DBLP:conf/caldam/ShaluVS17}]\label{obs:holes}
 For $n\geq 4$, we have  $\XCD (C_n)=\SC(C_n)$ if and only if $n=4k$ for some integer $k\geq 1$.
\end{observation}
We also note the observation below.
\begin{observation}\label{obs:antiholes}
For $n\geq 5$, we have  $\XCD (\bar{C_n})=\SC(\bar{C_n})$ if and only if $n=2k$ for some integer $k\geq 2$.
\end{observation}
\begin{proof}
First, note that for each $n\geq 5$,  $\bar{C_n}$ is $\mathcal{H}$-free (since $\alpha(\bar{C_n})\leq 2$, for each $n\geq 5$, but $\alpha(H)=3$ for each $H\in \mathcal{H}$). Also, for each $n\geq 5$, it is easy to see that $\bar{C_n}^*=C_n$ (since $\bar{C_n}^2$ is a clique on $n$ vertices). Therefore, by Theorem~\ref{thm:suff_cdclique} and Proposition~\ref{pro:omega_s}, we have, $\XCD(\bar{C_n})=k(\bar{C_n}^*)=k(C_n)=\lceil \frac{n}{2}\rceil$ and $\SC(\bar{C_n})=\alpha(\bar{C_n}^*)=\alpha(C_n)=\lfloor \frac{n}{2}\rfloor$. Therefore, we can conclude that $\XCD (\bar{C_n})=\SC(\bar{C_n})$ if and only if $n=2k$ for some integer $k\geq 2$.
\end{proof}
In the following theorem, we then have some necessary conditions for a graph $G$ to be $cd$-perfect. Observe that these conditions are \textit{almost} consistent with the necessary conditions for a graph to be perfect. The proof of the theorem is immediate from Observations~\ref{obs:holes} and~\ref{obs:antiholes}.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:necessary}
If a graph $G$ is $cd$-perfect, then $G$ is $C_n$-free for each $n\geq 4$ with $n\neq 4k$, and $\bar{C_n}$-free for each $n\geq 5$ with $n\neq 2k$, where $k$ is a positive integer.
\end{theorem}
