\section{Total domination and $cd$-coloring in triangle-free $d$-regular Graphs}
\label{sec:hardness}
In this section, we derive the hardness results for \CDC\ and \TD\ in triangle-free $d$-regular graphs for each fixed $d\geq 3$, and also prove that for each fixed integer $d\geq 3$, there exists a family of $d$-regular graphs for which the difference between $\XCD$ and $\gamma_t$ is arbitrarily high.
\subsection{Hardness results}
Here, we obtain the hardness results for \CDC\ in triangle-free $d$-regular graphs for each fixed $d\geq 3$.  First, we propose a simple linear reduction for triangle-free cubic graphs. Then, we generalize this result for  triangle-free $d$-regular graphs, for each fixed $d\geq 3$, by using  two linear reductions; one for odd values of $d$ and the other for even values.
We begin by stating the following theorem, which is one of the main results of this section.  


\begin{theorem}
    \label{thm:regular}
    \CDC\ is \NPC\ on triangle-free $d$-regular graphs, for each fixed integer $d\geq 3$. \TETHS.
\end{theorem}

To prove that a problem does not admit a subexponential-time algorithm, it is sufficient to obtain a linear reduction from a problem known not to admit
a subexponential-time algorithm, where a linear reduction is a polynomial-time reduction
in which the size of the resultant instance is linear in the size of the input instance. 
All reductions mentioned in this section are trivially linear.
We refer to the book~\cite{DBLP:books/sp/CyganFKLMPPS15} for more deatils about these concepts.
To prove the above theorem, we use three constructions. 
Construction~\ref{cons:cubic} is used for a reduction from \textsc{Total Domination}  on bipartite graphs  with bounded degree 3 to \CDC\ on triangle-free cubic graphs. Construction~\ref{cons:d-regular odd} is used for a reduction from \CDC\ on triangle-free $(d-2)$-regular graphs to \CDC\ on triangle-free $d$-regular graphs, for each odd integer $d\geq 5$, whereas the Construction~\ref{cons:d-regular even} is used for a reduction from \CDC\ on triangle-free $(d-1)$-regular graphs to \CDC\ on triangle-free $d$-regular graphs, for each even integer $d\geq 4$.

Now, we generalize  Construction~\ref{cons:cubic} to prove the hardness of \CDC\ on triangle-free $d$-regular graphs, for any constant $d\geq 4$. The following construction is used to prove the hardness of \CDC\ on triangle-free $d$-regular graphs, for any odd integer $d\geq 5$. 
\input{hardness/regular}

The following construction is used to prove the hardness of \CDC\ on triangle-free $d$-regular graphs, for any even integer $d\geq 4$.  
\input{hardness/regular_even}

\noindent\textit{Proof of Theorem~\ref{thm:regular}:} Note that $|V(G_{c1})|=2n(2d^2-3d+2)$, where $G_{c1}$ is obtained as per construction~\ref{cons:d-regular odd}. Similarly, $|V(G_{c2})|=n(2d^2-5d+3)$, where $G_{c2}$ is obtained as per construction~\ref{cons:d-regular even}. Hence, both constructions are linear with respect to their size of
inputs and hence their associated reductions are also linear reductions. 
Thus, we know that there is a linear reduction from triangle-free $(d-2)$-regular graphs to triangle-free $d$-regular graphs for odd integer $d\geq 5$ due to Lemma \ref{lem:d-regular odd}. 
We also know that there is a linear reduction from triangle-free $(d-1)$-regular graphs to triangle-free $d$-regular graphs  for even integer $d\geq 4$ due to Lemma \ref{lem:d-regular even}. Thus, we are done using Proposition~\ref{pro:bipartite} and Theorem~\ref{thm:cubic}.

The following corollary is obtained from Theorem~\ref{thm:regular} and Proposition~\ref{pro:triangle-free}.

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:total_domination_regular}
Total domination in triangle-free $d$-regular graphs  is \NPC, for any constant $d\geq 3$. \TETHS.
\end{theorem}
