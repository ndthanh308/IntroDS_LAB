 

\begin{construction}
    \label{cons:d-regular even}
     Let $G$ be a triangle-free $(d-1)$-regular graph, for any even integer $d\geq 4$.  Let $W$ be a gadget which is constructed in the following way. 
     The gadget $W$ contains $4d^2-10d+6$ vertices with two subgraphs $W_1$ and $W_2$ each having $2d^2-5d+3$ vertices. The adjacency among the vertices in $W_1$ (resp. $W_2$) is in such  a way that the $d-1$ vertices of $W_1$ (resp. $W_2$) induces a star graph $K_{1,d-2}$,  which we denote by $S_1$ (resp. $S_2$), having the vertex $a$ in $W_1$ (resp. the vertex $b$ in $W_2$) as the root vertex. Note that the vertices $a$ and $b$ are adjacent. Further in each set $W_i$, for $i\in \{1,2\}$, introduce $(2d^2-6d+4)$ vertices which induces $d-2$ disjoint copies of complete bipartite graphs $K_{d-1,d-1}$, namely $CB_{i,1},  CB_{i,2}\ldots,CB_{(i,d-2)}$ respectively.      
     The adjacency between these complete bipartite graphs $CB_{i,j}$, for $i\in \{1,2\}$ and $1\leq j\leq d-2$ and star graph $S_i$,  is in such a way that the vertices of one of the partition $A_{ij}$  of a complete bipartite graph $CB_{i,j}$ is connected to the leaf $j$  of  $S_i$.       
     Furthermore, for each odd integer $j\leq d-3$, each vertex of other partition $B_{i,j}$ of $CB_{i,j}$ is adjacent to exactly one vertex of the partition $B_{i,(j+1)}$ of $CB_{i,(j+1)}$  (for instance, refer Figure~\ref{fig:d-regular_gadget even}, when $d=4$). 
     Now the graph $G_c$ is constructed from $G$ using $W$ in such a way that consider an arbitrary pair-wise ordering $(v_1,v_2), (v_3,v_4)\ldots,(v_{n-1}, v_n)$ of vertices, in $G$.  Note that  such a pairing is possible, since $n$ is even (as $d-1$ is odd). 
     For a pair of vertices $(v_j,v_{j+1})$, for odd integer $j\leq n-1$ in this ordering, introduce a gadget $W$ such that the vertex $a$ (resp. $b$) of $W$ is adjacent to $v_j$ (resp. $v_{(j+1)}$) of $G$.
     The graph $G_c$ contains $n(2d^2-5d+3)$ vertices, where $n$ is the number of vertices in $G$.

    Let $W$ be a gadget constructed in Construction~\ref{cons:d-regular even}.
     Let $H$ be an induced subgraph obtained by the union of vertices of two complete bipartite graphs $CB_{ij}$ and $CB_{i(j+1)}$, for odd integer $j$, and the two leaves $c$ and $d$ of the star graph $S_i$ which is adjacent to the partition $A_j$ and $A_{j+1}$ of $CB_{ij}$ and $CB_{i(j+1)}$, respectively. Let 
     $H'=H\setminus \{c,d\}$. 

The following observation is true for the gadget $W$ of Construction~\ref{cons:d-regular even}. 
\begin{observation}
    \label{obs:Hcoloring_regular_even}
     Let $W$ be a gadget constructed in Construction~\ref{cons:d-regular even}.
     Let $H$ be an induced subgraph obtained by the union of vertices of two complete bipartite graphs $CB_{ij}$ and $CB_{i(j+1)}$, for odd integer $j$, and the two leaves $c$ and $d$ of the star graph $S_i$ which is adjacent to the partition $A_j$ and $A_{j+1}$ of $CB_{ij}$ and $CB_{i(j+1)}$, respectively. Let 
     $H'=H\setminus \{c,d\}$. In any CD-coloring of $H$, the vertices in $H'$ requires at least 4 colors. Moreover there exists a $cd$-coloring of $W$ using exactly  $4(d-2)$ colors.
\end{observation}

\begin{proof}
    Let $H$ be a subgraph of $W_1$ in $W$. The graph induced by $H'$ contains a $C_6$ (for example: induced by the vertices $d1,e1,g3,f3,g2,e2$ as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:d-regular_gadget even}). 
    It is clear that the \XCD($C_6$)=4. 
    Now consider the subgraph $H'$. It is obtained by 
    the introduction of new vertices adjacent to some vertices of the $C_6$.  Since none of the $3K_1$s present in the $C_6$ is dominated by any of the remaining vertices in $H'$, by Observation~\ref{obs:cdcolor_reduce}, it is clear that the number of colors needed for any $cd$-coloring of $H'$ is at least 4. 
    Further, note that all the independent sets in $H'$, which are dominated by $c$ or $d$, are already dominated by some vertex in $H'$. Therefore, again by Observation~\ref{obs:cdcolor_reduce}, it is clear that the number of colors needed for $V(H')$ in any $cd$-coloring of $H$ is at least 4. 
    Since the  vertex $a$ of the  $W_1$ is not adjacent to any of the vertices in $H'$, the presence of $a$ will not reduce the number of colors needed for $cd$-coloring of the subgraph $H'$ of the gadget $W$. Hence the number of colors needed for $cd$-coloring of $H$ is at least $4$. Therefore, the number of colors needed for $cd$-coloring of $W_1$ is at least $2(d-2)$, as there are $(d-2)/2$ copies of $H$ is present in $W_1$. Similarly,  the number of colors needed for $cd$-coloring of $W_2$ is at least $2(d-2)$, as there are $(d-2)/2$ copies of $H$ is present in $W_2$. Hence, it is clear that the number of colors needed for $cd$-coloring of $W$ is at least $4(d-2)$.
    Now it is easy to see that a 4-$cd$-coloring of a $C_6$ in each $H'$ can be  extended to a 2$(d-2)-cd$-coloring of the subgraph $W_i$  for $i\in \{1,2\}$, (by using the leaves of star graph $S_i$, and one of the vertices from the partition $A_{ij}$ of each $CB_{ij}$, for $1\leq j\leq (d-2)/2$, as the dominating vertices of the color classes). Now it is obvious that, these 2$(d-2)$-$cd$-coloring of the subgraph $W_i$ and $W_2$ can be extended to a 4$(d-2)$-$cd$-coloring of $W$. 
\end{proof}

The following lemma is based on the Construction~\ref{cons:d-regular even}.


\begin{lemma}
    \label{lem:d-regular even}
    For even integer $d\geq 4$, let $G$ be a triangle-free $(d-1)$-regular graph having $n$ vertices. Then $\XCD(G)=k$ if and only if $\XCD(G_c)=k+2n(d-2)$. 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
    Let $\XCD(G)=k$. We claim that $\XCD(G_c)=k+2n(d-2)$. Recall that the graph $G$ contains even number of vertices as it is a $(d-1)$-regular graph, where $d-1$ is odd. Hence $G_c$ contains $\frac{n}{2}$ gadgets as there are $n$ vertices in $G$ each having degree $d-1$. By Observation~\ref{obs:Hcoloring_regular_even}, it is clear that these gadgets need at least $2n(d-2)$ colors. Since \XCD($G$)=$k$, we then have \XCD($G_c$)=$k+2n(d-2)$. 

    Now for the reverse direction, let $\XCD(G_c)=m$. Then we claim that $\XCD(G)=k$, where $k=m-2n(d-2)$.  Note that only the vertices $a$ and $b$ of each gadget $W$ is adjacent to some vertices  $u$ and $v$ respectively in $G$. Hence the color class dominated by $a$ (resp. $b$) can include only one vertex $u$ (resp. $v$) in $G$.   
    By Observation~\ref{obs:Hcoloring_regular_even}, in any $cd$-coloring of $G_c$, the vertex set of each copy of $H'$ of any gadget $W$ needs at least 4 colors, and none of these colors can be reused for coloring the vertices in $V(G_c)\setminus V(W)$. Again by Observation~\ref{obs:Hcoloring_regular_even}, the same 4 colors used to color the vertices in $H'$ can be reused to color the entire vertices of $H$. Hence, the 4($d-2$) colors used for $(d-2)$ copies of $H$ in $W$ can be reused to color the entire vertices of $W$. Therefore, we now have a $cd$-coloring of $G_c$ using $m$ colors such that no colors used for the vertices in gadgets are used to color any vertex in $G$. Thus, $\XCD(G)=m-2n(d-2)=k$, as there are $\frac{n}{2}$ copies of $W$s in $G_c$.  
\end{proof}
