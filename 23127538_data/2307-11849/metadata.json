  "abstract": "Let $K$ be an algebraic number field and $H$ the absolute Weil height. Write $c_K$ for a certain positive constant that is an invariant of $K$. We consider the question: does $K$ contain an algebraic integer $α$ such that both $K = \\mathbb{Q}(α)$ and $H(α) \\le c_K$? If $K$ has a real embedding then a positive answer was established in previous work. Here we obtain a positive answer if $\\textrm{Tor}\\bigl(K^{\\times}\\bigr) \\not= \\{\\pm 1\\}$, and so $K$ has only complex embeddings. We also show that if the answer is negative, then $K$ is totally complex, $\\textrm{Tor}\\bigl(K^{\\times}\\bigr) = \\{\\pm 1\\}$, and $K$ is a Galois extension of its maximal totally real subfield. Further, we show that if $μ\\in O_K$ is not totally real, then there exists $α$ in $O_K$ with $K = \\mathbb{Q}(α)$ and $H(α) \\le H(μ)\\thinspace c_K$.",
