  "abstract": "A conceptual design of a launch vehicle involves the optimization of trajectory and stages considering its launch operations. This process encompasses various disciplines, such as structural design, aerodynamics, propulsion systems, flight control, and stage sizing. Traditional approaches used for the conceptual design of a launch vehicle conduct the stage and trajectory designs sequentially, often leading to high computational complexity and suboptimal results. This paper presents an optimization framework that addresses both trajectory optimization and staging in an integrated way. The proposed framework aims to maximize the payload-to-liftoff mass ratio while satisfying the constraints required for safe launch operations (e.g., the impact points of burnt stages and fairing). A case study demonstrates the advantage of the proposed framework compared to the traditional sequential optimization approach.",
