    abstract = "{Star–galaxy classification is one of the most fundamental data-processing tasks in survey astronomy and a critical starting point for the scientific exploitation of survey data. Star–galaxy classification for bright sources can be done with almost complete reliability, but for the numerous sources close to a survey’s detection limit each image encodes only limited morphological information about the source. In this regime, from which many of the new scientific discoveries are likely to come, it is vital to utilize all the available information about a source, both from multiple measurements and from prior knowledge about the star and galaxy populations. This also makes it clear that it is more useful and realistic to provide classification probabilities than decisive classifications. All these desiderata can be met by adopting a Bayesian approach to star–galaxy classification, and we develop a very general formalism for doing so. An immediate implication of applying Bayes’s theorem to this problem is that it is formally impossible to combine morphological measurements in different bands without using colour information as well; however, we develop several approximations that disregard colour information as much as possible. The resultant scheme is applied to data from the UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) and tested by comparing the results to deep Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Stripe 82 measurements of the same sources. The Bayesian classification probabilities obtained from the UKIDSS data agree well with the deep SDSS classifications both overall (a mismatch rate of 0.022 compared to 0.044 for the UKIDSS pipeline classifier) and close to the UKIDSS detection limit (a mismatch rate of 0.068 compared to 0.075 for the UKIDSS pipeline classifier). The Bayesian formalism developed here can be applied to improve the reliability of any star–galaxy classification schemes based on the measured values of morphology statistics alone.}",

journal = {The Astronomical Journal},
abstract = {We study the star/galaxy classification efficiency of 13 different decision tree algorithms applied to photometric objects in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release Seven (SDSS-DR7). Each algorithm is defined by a set of parameters which, when varied, produce different final classification trees. We extensively explore the parameter space of each algorithm, using the set of 884,126 SDSS objects with spectroscopic data as the training set. The efficiency of star–galaxy separation is measured using the completeness function. We find that the Functional Tree algorithm (FT) yields the best results as measured by the mean completeness in two magnitude intervals: 14 ⩽ r ⩽ 21 (85.2\%) and r ⩾ 19 (82.1\%). We compare the performance of the tree generated with the optimal FT configuration to the classifications provided by the SDSS parametric classifier, 2DPHOT, and Ball et al. We find that our FT classifier is comparable to or better in completeness over the full magnitude range 15 ⩽ r ⩽ 21, with much lower contamination than all but the Ball et al. classifier. At the faintest magnitudes (r &gt; 19), our classifier is the only one that maintains high completeness (&gt;80\%) while simultaneously achieving low contamination (∼2.5\%). We also examine the SDSS parametric classifier (psfMag − modelMag) to see if the dividing line between stars and galaxies can be adjusted to improve the classifier. We find that currently stars in close pairs are often misclassified as galaxies, and suggest a new cut to improve the classifier. Finally, we apply our FT classifier to separate stars from galaxies in the full set of 69,545,326 SDSS photometric objects in the magnitude range 14 ⩽ r ⩽ 21.}

abstract = {We discuss object classification for a multicolor survey of high-latitude fields from the Digitized Second Palomar Observatory Sky Survey (DPOSS) and the resulting Palomar-Norris Sky Catalog. Two methods are used to perform automated image classification for star-galaxy separation in DPOSS. As a source of classifier training/testing data, we employ an unprecedented 500 field collection of CCD photometry in the Thuan &amp; Gunn gri system obtained with the Palomar 60 inch (1.5 m) telescope. We have trained artificial neural network (ANN) and decision tree (DT) image classifiers using images of ≈4000 galaxies and ≈3000 stars classified with FOCAS on 52 deep CCD images. We assess the systematic errors in our classifiers as a function of apparent magnitude. To model the loss of galaxies through misclassification and the contamination of our galaxy samples by misclassified stars, we compare the DPOSS ANN+DT image classifications with image data from 46 CCD fields on 21 POSS-II fields not used in the initial training/testing process. We assess these same functions in a more stringent manner by comparing classifications of DPOSS images common with different fields via the plate overlaps. These tests are combined to derive analytic descriptions of sample incompleteness and contamination for future use in our assessment of multicolor galaxy number counts and the two-point angular correlation function. Finally, we derive star and galaxy number counts from 341 DPOSS fields covering a total of 7756 deg2 in both the north and south Galactic hemispheres. These data are used to establish a final correction for stellar contamination in our galaxy samples and to demonstrate the level of classification homogeneity in the DPOSS g and r catalogs drawn from a wide range of Galactic latitudes.}

 abstract = {ABSTRACT.This article describes the assembly of an optical (RGB) all-sky mosaic image with an image scale of 36″pixel-136″pixel-1, a limiting magnitude of approximately 14 mag, and an 18 bit dynamic range. Using a portable low-cost CCD camera system, 70 fields (each covering 40° × 27°40°×27°) were imaged over a time span of 22 months from dark-sky locations in South Africa, Texas, and Michigan. The fields were photometrically calibrated against standard catalog stars. Using sky background data from the Pioneer 10 and 11 space probes, gradients resulting from artificial light pollution, airglow, and zodiacal light were eliminated, while the large-scale galactic and extragalactic background resulting from unresolved sources was preserved. The 648 megapixel image is a valuable educational tool, being able to fully utilize the resolution and dynamic range of modern full-dome planetarium projection systems.},

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series},
abstract = {The Beijing–Arizona Sky Survey (BASS) is a wide and deep imaging survey that covers a 5400 deg2 area in the northern Galactic cap with the 2.3 m Bok telescope using two filters (g and r bands). The Mosaic z-band Legacy Survey (MzLS) covers the same area in the z band with the 4 m Mayall telescope. These two surveys will be used for spectroscopic targeting by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in the northernmost portion of the DESI footprint. This paper describes the third data release (DR3) of BASS, which contains the photometric data from all BASS and MzLS observations from 2015 January until the completion of BASS in 2019 March. The median astrometric precision relative to Gaia positions is about 17 mas and the median photometric offset relative to the Pan-STARRS1 photometry is within 5 mmag. The median 5σ AB magnitude depths for point sources are 24.2, 23.6, and 23.0 mag for the g, r, and z bands, respectively. The photometric depth within the survey area is highly homogeneous, and the difference between the 20% and 80% depth is less than 0.3 mag. The DR3 data, including raw data, calibrated single-epoch images, single-epoch photometric catalogs, stacked images, and co-added photometric catalogs, are publicly accessible at http://batc.bao.ac.cn/BASS/doku.php?id=datarelease:home.}

Observations were conducted from two dedicated 1.3 m diameter telescopes located at Mount Hopkins, Arizona, and Cerro Tololo, Chile. The 7.8 s of integration time accumulated for each point on the sky and strict quality control yielded a 10 σ point-source detection level of better than 15.8, 15.1, and 14.3 mag at the J, H, and Ks bands, respectively, for virtually the entire sky. Bright source extractions have 1 σ photometric uncertainty of &lt;0.03 mag and astrometric accuracy of order 100 mas. Calibration offsets between any two points in the sky are &lt;0.02 mag. The 2MASS All-Sky Data Release includes 4.1 million compressed FITS images covering the entire sky, 471 million source extractions in a Point Source Catalog, and 1.6 million objects identified as extended in an Extended Source Catalog.}

 abstract = {A sequence of 0's and 1's is observed and it is suspected that the chance that a particular trial is a 1 depends on the value of one or more independent variables. Tests and estimates for such situations are considered, dealing first with problems in which the independent variable is preassigned and then with independent variables that are functions of the sequence. There is a considerable amount of earlier work, which is reviewed.},

abstract = {In this paper I address the question—how large is a phylogenetic sample? I propose a definition of a phylogenetic effective sample size for Brownian motion and Ornstein–Uhlenbeck processes—the regression effective sample size. I discuss how mutual information can be used to define an effective sample size in the non-normal process case and compare these two definitions to an already present concept of effective sample size (the mean effective sample size). Through a simulation study I find that the AICc is robust if one corrects for the number of species or effective number of species. Lastly I discuss how the concept of the phylogenetic effective sample size can be useful for biodiversity quantification, identification of interesting clades and deciding on the importance of phylogenetic correlations.}
