  "abstract": "This paper introduces Borinot, an open-source aerial robotic platform designed to conduct research on hybrid agile locomotion and manipulation using flight and contacts. This platform features an agile and powerful hexarotor that can be outfitted with torque-actuated limbs of diverse architecture, allowing for whole-body dynamic control. As a result, Borinot can perform agile tasks such as aggressive or acrobatic maneuvers with the participation of the whole-body dynamics.\n  The limbs attached to Borinot can be utilized in various ways; during contact, they can be used as legs to create contact-based locomotion, or as arms to manipulate objects. In free flight, they can be used as tails to contribute to dynamics, mimicking the movements of many animals. This allows for any hybridization of these dynamic modes, making Borinot an ideal open-source platform for research on hybrid aerial-contact agile motion.\n  To demonstrate the key capabilities of Borinot in terms of agility with hybrid motion modes, we have fitted a planar 2DoF limb and implemented a whole-body torque-level model-predictive-control. The result is a capable and adaptable platform that, we believe, opens up new avenues of research in the field of agile robotics.
