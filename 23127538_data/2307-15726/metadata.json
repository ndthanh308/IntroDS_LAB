  "abstract": "The Bruhat order on a Coxeter group is often described by examining subexpressions of a reduced expression. We prove that an analogous description applies to the Bruhat order on double cosets. This establishes the compatibility of the Bruhat order on double cosets with concatenation, leading to compatibility between the monoidal structure and the ideal of lower terms in the singular Hecke 2-category. We also prove other fundamental properties of this ideal of lower terms.",
