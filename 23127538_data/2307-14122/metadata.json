  "abstract": "We study $N$ qubits having infinite-range Ising interaction and subjected to periodic pulse of external magnetic field. We solve the cases of $N=5$ to $11$ qubits analytically, finding its eigensystem, the dynamics of the entanglement for various initial states, and the unitary evolution operator. These quantities shows signatures of quantum integrability. For the general case of $N>11$ qubits, we provide a conjecture on quantum integrability based on the numerical evidences like degenerate spectrum, and the exact periodic nature of the time-evolved unitary evolution operator and the entanglement dynamics. Using linear entropy we show that for class of initial unentangled state the entanglement displays periodically maximum and zero values.",

  "comment": "5 pages (two-column) + 26 pages (one-column) + 3 figures. This is a substantially improved version of the previous manuscript, arXiv:2307.14122v1 [quant-ph]. There, we wrongly claimed that the semiclassical limit exists for k=j*pi. In the revised manuscript, the results are interpreted as a spin chain, and it does not have a semiclassical limit. This version is now accepted in Physical Review B",
