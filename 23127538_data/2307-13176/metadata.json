  "abstract": "In natural language generation (NLG), insight mining is seen as a data-to-text task, where data is mined for interesting patterns and verbalised into 'insight' statements. An 'over-generate and rank' paradigm is intuitively used to generate such insights. The multidimensionality and subjectivity of this process make it challenging. This paper introduces a schema-driven method to generate actionable insights from data to drive growth and change. It also introduces a technique to rank the insights to align with user interests based on their feedback. We show preliminary qualitative results of the insights generated using our technique and demonstrate its ability to adapt to feedback.",
