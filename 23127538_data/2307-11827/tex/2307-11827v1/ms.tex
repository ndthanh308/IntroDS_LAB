%\noindent \textit{\textbf{Abstract}}- \\
Obstructions influence the growth and expansion of bodies in a wide range of settings---but isolating and understanding their impact can be difficult in complex environments. Here, we study obstructed growth/expansion in a model system accessible to experiments, simulations, and theory: hydrogels swelling around fixed cylindrical 
obstacles with varying geometries. When the obstacles are large and widely-spaced, hydrogels swell around them and remain intact. In contrast, our experiments reveal that when the obstacles are narrow and closely-spaced, hydrogels unexpectedly fracture as they swell. We use finite element simulations to map the magnitude and spatial distribution of stresses that build up during swelling at equilibrium, providing a route toward predicting when this phenomenon of self-fracturing is likely to arise. Applying lessons from indentation theory, poroelasticity, and nonlinear continuum mechanics, we also develop a theoretical framework for understanding how the maximum principal tensile and compressive stresses that develop during swelling are controlled by obstacle geometry and material parameters. These results thus help to shed light on the mechanical principles underlying growth/expansion in environments with obstructions.

%\noindent\textit{\textbf{Significance statement}}-\\ Consider a body that is increasing in size by e.g., biological growth, fluid uptake, chemical reactions, or phase transitions. This process often does not happen in isolation. Instead, in many scenarios---in everyday life, and in agriculture, biology, and manufacturing---the body encounters obstructions as it grows/expands. How do obstructions affect growth/expansion? Here, we address this question using studies of hydrogels, polymer networks that swell in water, in obstacle arrays. Remarkably, we find that when the hydrogel is sufficiently obstructed, it tears itself apart as it swells. We develop theoretical and computational tools to understand the magnitude and distribution of swelling-induced stresses that lead to this phenomenon, helping to provide a framework to predict and control obstructed growth/expansion.\\

\maketitle
Many growth and expansion processes are sculpted through confinement by rigid obstructions. Familiar examples include muffins rising into their characteristic shape during baking \cite{ding2019thermomechanical}, trees growing around boulders \cite{taylor2021mechanism}, and even cities expanding around inhospitable geographic features \cite{borsdorf2020urban}. Obstructed growth and expansion also play pivotal roles---both harmful and beneficial---in many practical applications. For example, excessive tissue growth around metal mesh tubes inserted into blood vessels is a common, but life-threatening, complication of stenting \cite{byrne2015stent, kuhl2007computational, cheng2021finite}; conversely, the expansion of spray foam into cracks and in between walls underlies the thermal insulation of many energy-efficient buildings \cite{cabeza2010experimental}. More broadly, obstructed growth and expansion critically influence the emergence of form and function across diverse non-living and living systems, ranging from hydrogels added to soil for water retention to  biofilms and biological tissues in complex environments~\cite{louf_under_2021, beebe2000functional, alben2022packing, chu2018self, streichan2014spatial, bengough1997biophysical, alric2022macromolecular}. Therefore, we ask: are there general principles that dictate how obstructions influence growth and expansion? And if so, how do we discover them?

When the growth/expansion of a body is resisted by surrounding obstructions, large and spatially-nonuniform
stresses can develop, influencing subsequent growth/expansion in turn~\cite{ambrosi2019growth, goriely}. Being able to understand the distribution and magnitude of these stresses is thus a necessary step in the development of widely-applicable, predictive models of growth and expansion. Unfortunately, due to the complexity of real-world materials and environments, model systems in which the coupling between growth and stress can be systematically studied are scarce. Here, we address this issue using studies of spherical hydrogel beads swelling in 3D-printed obstacle arrays with defined geometries. Hydrogels are cross-linked networks of hydrophilic polymers that can absorb large amounts of water and swell while still retaining integrity. As a result, they are extensively used in biomedical, environmental, and manufacturing
applications, and have well-characterized and highly-tunable properties such as their degree of swelling and elasticity \cite{zhang2017advances, oyen_mechanical_2014, deligkaris2010hydrogel, guo2020hydrogels}. Indeed, the comprehensive theoretical literature on hydrogel swelling makes computations of shape and internal stresses accessible for a variety of boundary conditions. While much work has focused on the case of a hydrogel swelling while adhered to another material~\cite{tanaka1987mechanical, hong2008theory, hong2009inhomogeneous,kang2010variational,  marcombe2010theory, amar2010swelling,dervaux2012mechanical, kim2010dynamic, cho2019crack}, non-adhered swelling around obstructions has received limited attention, primarily being considered in the context of indentation testing~\cite{hui2006contact, hong2008theory, hu2010using, bouklasfem}. 

Our study extends this body of work. First, we use experiments to directly visualize how hydrogel swelling is altered by obstacles of systematically-varying geometries. When obstacles are positioned further apart, the hydrogel swells through the spaces between them and maintains its integrity. By contrast, when the obstacles are closer together, we observe a surprising phenomenon: the hydrogel fractures, repeatedly tearing itself apart as it swells! We then use theory and simulations to rationalize these observations, and importantly, quantify and understand the distribution of stresses. Taken together, our work provides a prototypical example of obstructed growth/expansion and uncovers unexpected swelling behaviors and mechanical instabilities that can result during this process---highlighting the rich physics waiting to be explored in this area of soft mechanics.


\section{Experiments}
Our experimental platform is schematized in Fig. \ref{fig:schematic}A and detailed in \textit{Materials and Methods}. To define the obstacles, we 3D-print four rigid cylindrical columns of radius $r_{\rm{obs}}$ to be placed an equal distance $r_{\rm{ctr}}$ from a central point; in the experiments, we vary $r_{\rm{obs}}$ and $r_{\rm{ctr}}$ between $2.5-15$~mm and $3.5-25$~mm, respectively. The cylinders are securely attached to horizontal, parallel laser-engraved acrylic plates spaced vertically by a fixed amount, $\Delta z=40$~mm. Importantly, these plates are transparent, permitting direct visualization of a hydrogel as it swells between the cylindrical obstacles and parallel plates. Hence, at the beginning of each experiment, we place a spherical polyacrylamide hydrogel bead of initial radius $\sim 6$~mm (characterized in SI Appendices A, B) in the center and submerge the entire apparatus in a bath of ultrapure milli-Q water---thereby initiating swelling, which we track using a camera focused on the top plate. 

We first examine the case of obstacles that are spaced further apart. As the hydrogel swells, it contacts the top and bottom plates, as well as the cylinders, and continues to swell through the space between them (Fig.~\ref{fig:schematic}B, Movie S1). It eventually reaches an unchanging four-lobed equilibrium shape that reflects the balance between the osmotic pressure driving swelling and the elastic stresses arising from the polymer network and hydrogel-obstacle contact~\cite{louf_poroelastic_2021, louf_under_2021}. 

The case of closer-spaced obstacles of the same size is dramatically different. We observe similar behavior to the previous case of less confinement at early times: the hydrogel contacts the surrounding surfaces and swells through the space between them. As these lobes continue to swell, however, cracks abruptly form at the hydrogel surface (48~h in Fig.~\ref{fig:schematic}C), reflecting the development of large stresses during obstructed swelling. Remarkably, this process then continues, resulting in elaborate, multi-step fracturing of the hydrogel as it swells, repeatedly ejecting fragments of the hydrogel outward (Fig.~\ref{fig:schematic}C, Movie S2). This process eventually stops as the hydrogel reaches its final equilibrium degree of swelling. Several other representative examples of fracturing hydrogels with different obstacle geometries are shown in Movies S3 and S4. The fracturing process varies significantly between samples, reflecting the acute sensitivity of crack formation and propagation on the random imperfections in the hydrogel and the complex topography arising from previous fracturing~\cite{gdoutos2020fracture,wang2022hidden, li2023crack}. To our knowledge, this is the first report of fracture induced by obstructed swelling.

These observations suggest that, when sufficiently obstructed, a growing/expanding body can tear itself apart. To characterize the dependence of this phenomenon on confinement, we repeat these experiments with obstacles of varying sizes $r_{\rm{obs}}$ and spacings $r_{\rm{ctr}}$. We observe a similar phenomenon in all cases, as summarized in the state diagram in Fig. \ref{fig:threshold}. When the obstacles are far apart, the hydrogel swells and retains its integrity ($\square$), while when the obstacles are closer i.e., $r_{\rm{ctr}}$ is below a threshold value, the hydrogel repeatedly self-fractures as it swells ($\times$). This threshold value also depends on the size of the obstacles. One might expect that fracturing is promoted when the hydrogel has less free space to swell into i.e., larger $r_{\rm{obs}}$; in stark contrast to this expectation, we find that for a given $r_{\rm{ctr}}$, fracturing occurs \textit{below} a threshold value of $r_{\rm{obs}}$. We rationalize this intriguing observation using theory and simulations in the following sections. The two geometric parameters $r_{\rm{ctr}}$ and $r_{\rm{obs}}$ thus delineate a boundary between swelling without fracture and obstructed swelling causing fracture, as shown by the light and dark green regions, respectively, in Fig. \ref{fig:threshold}. 

To demonstrate the generality of this phenomenon, we repeat our experiments in fully 3D granular packings, which more closely mimic the obstructions experienced by hydrogels in many applications \cite{misiewicz2022characteristics, krafcik2017improved, kapur1996hydrodynamic, dolega2017cell, lee2019dispersible, woodhouse1991effect, demitri2013potential, guilherme2015superabsorbent, lejcus2018swelling, wei2013effect}. Our previous experiments \cite{louf_under_2021} using this platform used a solvent that promoted only slight hydrogel swelling, and therefore accessed the case of weak confinement; however, repeating these experiments with a solvent that promotes more hydrogel swelling indeed gives rise to self-fracturing, as shown in Fig. S4 (SI Appendix C). Thus, this phenomenon of obstructed growth/expansion causing fracture arises not just in idealized geometries, but also in more realistic complex spaces. 

\section{Theory and simulations}
What are the essential physical principles that govern this phenomenon? To address this question, we develop finite element simulations that incorporate the energetic penalty of contacting obstructions into a model of hydrogel swelling based on classic Flory-Rehner theory. Our goal is to better understand the complex distribution of stresses that arises during obstructed swelling, not to quantitatively capture all the features of the experiments; as such, we use a simplified two-dimensional (2D) model that permits straightforward visualization of stresses and thereby enables us to develop an intuitive and analytic description of the underlying physics. 

We describe stretching of the hydrogel polymer network and solvent-polymer interactions with the commonly-used free energy density \cite{floryrehner, flory, hong2008theory, hong2009inhomogeneous, kang2010variational, bouklasfem}:
\begin{align}
    \frac{F_{\rm{en}}}{A_0 k_B T}&=\frac{n_p}{2}  \left( F_{iK} F_{iK} - 2 - 2 \ln(\det(\*F))\right) \nonumber \\&+\frac{1}{\Omega} \left(\Omega C \ln \left( \frac{\Omega C}{1+\Omega C} \right) + \chi \frac{\Omega C}{1+\Omega C} \right). \label{eq:freeen}
\end{align}
The first term describes the elastic free energy: $n_p$ is the number of polymer chains per unit dry reference area $A_0$ and $F_{iK}=\frac{\partial x_i}{\partial X_K}$ is the deformation gradient tensor, with $F_{iK} F_{iK}=\mathrm{tr}(\*F^T \*F)=\sum_i \lambda_i^2$ in terms of principal stretches $\lambda_i$. Following standard conventions, deformed/current configurations are denoted by lowercase letters and reference/initial configurations are denoted by capital letters unless otherwise noted \cite{goriely}. The second term describes the mixing free energy: $\Omega$ is the area of a solvent molecule, $C$ is the nominal concentration of solvent (number of solvent molecules per unit reference area), and $\chi$ is the Flory-Huggins interaction parameter. Both terms are scaled by the product of the Boltzmann constant and temperature, $k_B T$. 

Given that the hydrogel network is held together by permanent cross-links between its polymer chains, we additionally assume that it only changes volume by uptake of solvent, which allows us to express concentrations in terms of the deformation: $\det(\*F)=1+\Omega C$. We require the chemical potential $\mu$ to be zero on the boundary of the hydrogel to mimic submerging it in pure water, as in the experiments. To impose this boundary condition, we perform the standard Legendre transform of Eq. \eqref{eq:freeen} and derive a new free energy $\hat{F}_{\rm{en}}$ in terms of $\mu$ as $\hat{F}_{\rm{en}}(x_i, \mu) =F_{\rm{en}}(x_i, C)-\mu C$ \cite{hong2009inhomogeneous}.  Finally, we model contact by imposing an energy penalty for overlap between the hydrogel and obstacles; as detailed in \textit{Materials and Methods}, our results are insensitive to the choice of this parameter. Note that the chemical potential boundary condition $\mu=0$ is enforced in the regions of contact between the hydrogel and the obstacles (see SI Appendix E for further discussion).

%Obstacle radii and separations are given in terms of $r^*$, the 2D equilibrium hydrogel radius in the absence of confinement. Thus, $r_{\rm{ctr}}/r^* = 1$ permits unobstructed swelling. 

To visualize and track hydrogel deformation during obstructed swelling, along with the concomitant development of internal stresses, we implement this model in FEniCS \cite{alnaes2015fenics}, an open-source finite element platform. Our simulations consider a circular hydrogel swelling around four fixed obstacles. Although our primary focus is the stress distribution in the hydrogel at equilibrium, we simulate the full dynamics of obstructed swelling to provide numerical stability and ensure that there is a realistic path from the initial to the final equilibrium swollen state (SI Appendix E). 

We begin by examining hydrogel swelling around obstacles that have the same size, but varying spacing---just as in the experiments shown in Fig. \ref{fig:schematic}(B,C). Four representative examples, varying from the case of weak to strong confinement, are shown in Fig. \ref{fig:sims1}(A-D). The corresponding maximum tensile and compressive principal stresses on the line connecting the hydrogel center to an obstacle center are plotted in panels (E,F). We quantify these variations using $\Delta/r^*\equiv\left(r^*-r_{\rm{ctr}}\right)/r^*$, where $r^*$ is the equilibrium, fully-swollen, unconfined radius of the hydrogel and $\Delta$ is the difference between $r^*$ and the distance from the center to the closest obstacle $r_{\rm{ctr}}$.  The case of weak confinement in (A) has $\Delta/r^*=0.02$, increasing to $\Delta/r^*=0.6$ for the case of strong confinement in (D). As seen by the color maps of solvent concentration and principal stresses in panel~(A), in this limit of weak confinement, the hydrogel is barely deformed and the resultant stresses are not visible when plotted on the same scale as (B--D). Thus, as we describe in Sec. \ref{sec:weak}, the hydrogel stresses can be captured analytically using linear theories in this regime. Increasing hydrogel confinement causes the magnitudes of the stresses to increase (panels E,F), but they still remain primarily localized near the obstacles; as discussed in Sec. \ref{sec:intermediate1} and Sec. \ref{sec:intermediate2}, the largest compressive stresses can still be described by linear theory, but the largest tensile stresses require consideration of a geometric nonlinearity. As the separation between obstacles decreases further, large compressive stresses span the entirety of the hydrogel (panel C), eventually triggering a symmetry-breaking instability (panel D) as discussed in Sec. \ref{sec:strong}.  Finally, while our model is not suitable to treat fracture directly, we discuss the connection between our calculations of stresses and the experimental observations of swelling-induced self-fracture in Sec. \ref{sec:comparison}.

\subsection{Weak confinement}\label{sec:weak}
Consider a hydrogel disk that has swollen around obstacles to reach equilibrium. The chemical potential is spatially uniform and therefore all solvent transport has stopped. Nonetheless, due to contact with the obstacles, the distribution of solvent is inhomogeneous through the hydrogel: solvent preferentially enters the uncompressed lobes of the hydrogel between the obstacles, as shown by the yellow color in Fig.~\ref{fig:schematic}B~\cite{louf_poroelastic_2021}. Now, consider another hydrogel that was first swollen, unobstructed, to its equilibrium size, and then slowly and incrementally squeezed by an identical set of obstacles moving towards its center, acting as four indenters. Solvent must exit the hydrogel where it is indented by the obstacles; recall our condition $1+ \Omega C= \det(\*F)$. For the same final obstacle geometry, these two scenarios must have identical solvent distributions and stress profiles at equilibrium. Thus, the long time limit of obstructed swelling can be treated as an indentation problem, which is well-studied in the limit of small deformations. Making this analogy between obstructed swelling and indentation allows us to apply lessons from a large body of literature on linear contact mechanics and poroelasticity to derive expressions for the stress tensor in the hydrogel \cite{hui2006contact, hu2010using, goriely2016stress, weickenmeier2016mechanics}.

Assuming that deformations relative to the fully swollen state are small, we linearize Eq. \eqref{eq:freeen} to find effective linear elastic parameters (SI Appendix F, \cite{hu2011indentation, bouklasporo}). In particular, for a 2D hydrogel, the effective Poisson's ratio $\nu$ and Young's modulus $E$ are given by
\begin{align}
    \nu&=1-2 n_p \Omega\left(n_p \Omega \left(1+\frac{1}{\lambda_0^2}\right) + \frac{1}{\lambda_0^2 (\lambda_0^2-1)}-\frac{2 \chi}{\lambda_0^4}\right)^{-1}\label{poisson},\\
     E&= 2(1+\nu) n_p k_B T \label{youngs},
\end{align}
where $\lambda_0$ is the principal stretch corresponding to the fully swollen state. The expression for the Poisson's ratio can be understood as its value for an incompressible 2D solid, $\nu=1$, minus a correction---reflecting the fact that the compressibility of the swollen hydrogel is generated via solvent transport. This linearization also yields the shear modulus, $G_0=n_p k_B T$, which we use to normalize stresses throughout this paper. 

Given these effective elastic parameters, we solve for the stresses in the hydrogel as a 2D linear contact mechanics problem (SI Appendix G, \cite{barber2018contact,johnson}).
This approach provides expressions for the stress tensor $\sigma_{ij}$ along the line directly beneath the top obstacle as a function of $y$ as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:contactparams}B:
%, where varying $y$ from $0$ to $r^*$ takes us from the center of the hydrogel to the surface of the circular indenter

    \begin{align}
    \sigma_{xx}&=\frac{2 \zeta}{\pi} \Bigg(\frac{2 r^{* 3}}{(r^{*2}+y^2)^2} -\frac{1}{r^*}-\frac{2 (r^*-y)}{a^2}\nonumber\\&+ \frac{2 (r^*-y)^2 +a^2}{a^2 \sqrt{(r^*-y)^2 +a^2}} \Bigg),\label{eq:sxx}\\
    \sigma_{yy}&=\frac{2 \zeta}{\pi} \left( \frac{1}{r^*+y} -\frac{1}{r^*}+\frac{2 r^* y^2 }{(r^{*2}+y^2)^2}+ \frac{1}{\sqrt{(r^*-y)^2 + a^2}} \right),\label{eq:syy}\\
    \sigma_{xy}&=0,
    \end{align}
where $\zeta<0$ is the force applied to the indenters and the half contact width $a$ is
\begin{equation}
    a=\sqrt{- \frac{4 \zeta}{E \pi \left( \frac{1}{r_{\rm{obs}}}+\frac{1}{r^*}\right)}},
\end{equation}
as defined in Fig. \ref{fig:contactparams}B. Note that $y$ is defined with respect to the hydrogel's unobstructed, fully-swollen state and ranges from $-r^*$ to $r^*$.

Given these analytical expressions, we next ask: Under what confinement regimes (as parameterized by $\Delta/r^*$) does this linearized theory work, and when does it break down? And since we would like to gain an intuitive understanding of obstructed swelling-induced fracture, how does the maximal principal tensile stress --- which can be used to approximate material strength \cite{gdoutos2020fracture}--- vary with confinement? To address these questions, we first re-cast Eqs.~\eqref{eq:sxx}--\eqref{eq:syy} in terms of $\Delta/r^*$ to facilitate direct comparison with the results of the nonlinear simulations. To do so, we integrate the strain $u_{yy}=\frac{\sigma_{yy}}{Y}-\frac{\nu}{Y} \sigma_{xx}$ using Eqs. \eqref{eq:sxx}--\eqref{eq:syy} to find the displacement at the surface of the indenter relative to the center of the hydrogel, and expand the result to linear order in $a/r^*$. This procedure gives
\begin{equation}
    \Delta = -\frac{\zeta}{E \pi} \left(\ln \left(\frac{16 r^{*2}}{a^2}\right) + \frac{1}{2} (\pi -6 - \pi \nu) \right),
\end{equation}
which we then invert, apply Eqs.~\eqref{poisson}--\eqref{youngs}, and substitute the resulting expression for $\zeta(\Delta)$ into Eqs.~\eqref{eq:sxx}--\eqref{eq:syy}. The resulting expressions for $\sigma_{xx}(\Delta)$ and $\sigma_{yy}(\Delta)$ cannot be expressed in terms of elementary functions, so we omit them, but are shown by the solid lines in Fig.~\ref{fig:contactparams} for the illustrative case of $r_{\rm{obs}}/r^*=0.3$; for comparison, the symbols show the results of the full nonlinear simulations. 

As expected, when $\Delta/r^* \ll 1$, the linearized indentation solution agrees well with the nonlinear simulation results, while as $\Delta/r^*$ increases, the discrepancy between the two becomes more apparent. In particular, as exemplified by the data for $\Delta/r^*=0.16$ (dark blue circles) and $\Delta/r^*=0.13$ (yellow squares) in Fig.~\ref{fig:contactparams}, the linear solution underestimates the compression at both the center $y=0$ and boundary $y=r^*$ of the hydrogel, as well as the tension that builds up at $y/r^* \approx 0.75$ (Fig. \ref{fig:contactparams}A, inset). Indeed, though tension ($\sigma_{xx}>0$) does appear in the linear solutions for small $\Delta/r^*$, it disappears with increasing $\Delta/r^*$, in contrast to the simulation results (see arrow in Fig. \ref{fig:sims1}C, for example). 

Since we are interested in fracture behavior, we thus focus our attention on the maximal value of this tensile stress for the same illustrative case of $r_{\rm{obs}}/r^*=0.3$. By symmetry, we expect the largest stresses to lie beneath each obstacle, since stresses must go to zero at the hydrogel boundary away from obstacles in the weak confinement regime. Moreover, because the straight edges of the finite element mesh can introduce spurious tensile forces at the edge of the hydrogel-obstacle contact (described further in SI Appendix I), we plot the maximum and minimum values of the principal stresses along the $x=0$ line shown in the schematic inset of Fig.~\ref{fig:contactparams}B. The results are displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:sims1}(E,F). As noted in Fig.~\ref{fig:contactparams}A, the linear theory only predicts the presence of tension for small confinement before deviating from the nonlinear simulation results at $\Delta/r^*\gtrsim0.02$, as shown by the solid line and points in Fig.~\ref{fig:sims1}E, respectively. Interestingly, however, linear theory captures the maximum compressive stress over a broader range of confinement, shown by the solid line in Fig. \ref{fig:sims1}F, which agrees well with the simulation data up to $\Delta/r^* \approx 0.2$. 

Thus, while linear indentation theory can predict both tensile and compressive stresses during obstructed swelling in weak confinement, it underpredicts both for larger deformations---suggesting that the assumptions made in the linear theory are no longer valid. We revisit these assumptions for both tension and compression in the next two sections, respectively. 

\subsection{Tension beyond the linear regime}\label{sec:intermediate1}
The linear theory in the previous section relies on a number of assumptions that can fail as deformations increase:
\begin{enumerate}
\item The effective elastic parameters [Eqs. \eqref{poisson}--\eqref{youngs}] are independent of strain,
\item The stress is linearly related to the strain,
\item The strain tensor is linear in the displacements.
\end{enumerate}
To assess the validity of these assumptions, we compare the results of our full nonlinear simulations to those of more complex elastic models that incorporate \emph{material}/\emph{geometric} nonlinearities.

First, we explore the limits of assumption 1 by relaxing assumptions 2 \& 3. Specifically, we compare the hydrogel simulation results to those of a compressible neo-Hookean elastic material with elastic parameters given by Eqs. \eqref{poisson}--\eqref{youngs}. As detailed in SI Appendix F, the neo-Hookean model closely reproduces the stress profiles of the hydrogel simulations over a broad range of $\Delta/r^*$ up to $\approx 0.4$, well beyond the limits of the linear theory at $\sim 0.02$. Therefore, nonlinearities due to the effective elastic parameter mapping can be neglected up to this point. 

Next, we explore the limits of assumption 2 by relaxing assumption 3. Specifically, we use a St. Venant-Kirchoff elastic model with strain tensor $u_{ij}=\frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{\partial u_i}{\partial x_j} + \frac{\partial u_j}{\partial x_i} + \frac{\partial u_{k}}{\partial x_i} \frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_j}\right)$; thus, the strain tensor is nonlinear in displacements, but we still require that the hydrogel material follows a linear constitutive law. Note that derivatives are taken with respect to coordinates in the unobstructed, fully-swollen state, denoted here with lowercase letters for simplicity of presentation. Intriguingly, as detailed in SI Appendix H, the St. Venant-Kirchhoff model quantitatively reproduces the maximum principal tensile stress in the hydrogel simulations up to $\Delta/r^*\approx 0.1$, well beyond the limit of the linear theory at $\approx 0.02$. Hence, the excess tension $\sigma_{xx}$ that develops beneath the obstacles just beyond the linear regime is driven by \emph{geometric} nonlinearity, and does not require a nonlinear constitutive relationship. At even larger displacements $\Delta/r^* > 0.1$, the St. Venant-Kirchoff simulations are unstable and we expect that both geometric and material nonlinearities contribute to the tensile stress. %Geometric nonlinearities are significant in materials experiencing large rotations---in our system, these rotations appear as the hydrogel wraps itself around the obstacle.

How exactly does geometric nonlinearity generate tension during obstructed swelling? We answer this question using an illustrative argument reminiscent of the derivation of the F\"oppl-von K\'arm\'an equation \cite{landau}. As detailed in \emph{Materials and Methods}, we first find the variation of the integrated St. Venant-Kirchhoff strain-energy function with respect to displacements, which can be written in terms of the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor, $\sigma_{ij}^{PK}$. In 2D, this quantity gives the stress component in a material direction $i$ perpendicular to a line that has unit length and normal $j$ in the reference configuration \cite{audoly2010elasticity}. We then make approximations specific to our obstacle geometry. Ultimately, we find
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{xx}^{PK} \approx -\frac{\partial \sigma_{yy}^{PK}}{\partial y}\left(1+\frac{\Delta}{r^*} \right)r_{\rm{obs}}.\label{eq:sigxx}
\end{equation}
Since $\sigma_{yy}^{PK}$ becomes more negative as $y$ increases, $\frac{\partial \sigma_{yy}^{PK}}{\partial y}<0$ (Fig. \ref{fig:contactparams}B), and therefore $\sigma_{xx}^{PK}>0$ indicating tension. Thus, geometric nonlinearity generates tension beneath an indenter perpendicular to the indentation direction, qualitatively matching our simulations.

\subsection{Compression beyond the linear regime}\label{sec:intermediate2}
A notable result shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sims1} is that while linear indentation theory predicts tensile stresses for $\Delta/r^*<0.02$, it captures the compressive stresses over a broader range, up to $\Delta/r^*\approx0.2$. Which nonlinearities drive the deviations that arise at even larger displacements? We answer this question by following the same procedure as in the previous section, detailed further in SI Appendix F \& H. In contrast to the case of tension, we 
do not find any parameters for which the St. Venant-Kirchoff model is more accurate than the linear model. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:sims1}F, past the linear regime, the compressive (Cauchy) stress underneath the top obstacle scales like that of a compressible neo-Hookean elastic material experiencing uniaxial compression, with the principal stretch parallel to indentation set to $\lambda_1=1-\Delta/r^*$ and the principal stretch perpendicular to the indentation set to 1:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{yy} \sim G_0 \left(1-\frac{\Delta}{r^*}\right) + \frac{2 G_0 \nu}{1-\nu} \frac{\ln\left(1-\frac{\Delta}{r^*}\right)}{\left(1-\frac{\Delta}{r^*}\right)} - \frac{G_0}{\left(1-\frac{\Delta}{r^*}\right)}.\label{eq:nh}
\end{equation}
Thus, unlike the case of tension, deviations from the linear theory do not arise from geometric nonlinearities and can instead be attributed to \emph{material} nonlinearities. 

\subsection{Symmetry-breaking instability}\label{sec:strong}
A striking phenomenon arises in our simulations as the separation between obstacles decreases further: as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sims1}D, the hydrogel displays a symmetry-breaking instability and swells preferentially along a diagonal. Why does this instability arise? Inspecting the spatial distribution of compressive stresses provides a clue. As the hydrogel swells in increasing amounts of confinement, its central core becomes increasingly compressed (see, e.g., Fig.~\ref{fig:sims1}C--D). Compressing this circular core along a \emph{single} axis, forming an ellipse, requires less energy than does compressing this core isotropically. Thus, as confinement increases, one expects the case of asymmetric swelling to be energetically preferred, leading to this instability---as described further in SI Appendix J.

\section{Comparison between simulations and experiments}\label{sec:comparison}
Our theoretical analyses and simulations capture the essential features of the hydrogel deformation observed in experiments (e.g., Figs.~\ref{fig:schematic}B and \ref{fig:sims1}C). They also enabled us to explore how stresses develop during obstructed swelling more generally (Figs.~\ref{fig:sims1}--\ref{fig:contactparams}). While our model is not suitable to directly treat the swelling-induced self-fracture observed experimentally, the simulated stresses help rationalize this phenomenon. To this end, we compare the simulations to the experimental state diagram shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:threshold} by plotting the maximum principal tensile and compressive stresses as a function of $r_{\rm{obs}}$ and $r_{\rm{ctr}}$. The results, shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:sims4}, bear a compelling resemblance to the experimental results. In particular, the convexity and shape of the experimental fracture boundary are similar to the simulated contours of maximum principal stress. Indeed, appealing to a commonly-used fracture criterion for brittle materials \cite{gdoutos2020fracture}, we expect that hydrogel fracture occurs when the maximum tensile stress exceeds a threshold --- whose exact value would establish the position of the experimental fracture boundary in Fig.~\ref{fig:sims4}A. We conjecture that this threshold is reached prior to the symmetry-breaking instability revealed by the simulations, as we do not observe it in our experiments; experiments using tougher hydrogels than those studied here may be a useful way to probe this deformation mode in future work. 

\section{Discussion}
Despite the ubiquity of obstructed growth and expansion in our everyday lives, how exactly this process generates large, spatially non-uniform stresses in a body --- and how these stresses influence its subsequent growth/expansion in turn --- has remained challenging to systematically study. One reason is the lack of model systems in which this intricate coupling between growth and stress can be probed both experimentally and theoretically. We addressed this need by studying the swelling of spherical hydrogel beads in obstacle arrays of tunable geometries. Our experiments revealed a striking phenomenon: under weak confinement, a hydrogel retains its integrity and assumes a symmetric, four-lobed clover-like shape, while in stronger confinement, it repeatedly tears itself apart as it swells. We elucidated the underlying physics by adopting established models of hydrogel swelling to map the tensile and compressive stresses arising during swelling. In particular, we found that when a hydrogel is weakly deformed, stresses are well-described by linear indentation theory, while as a hydrogel is increasingly deformed, geometric and material nonlinearities engender large tensile and compressive stresses tangential and normal to the obstacles, respectively, driving the hydrogel towards fracture. 

Because our study represents a first step toward fully unravelling the mechanics of obstructed growth and expansion, it necessarily has limitations. For example, while the experimental results shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:threshold} revealed a fracture threshold that varies with obstacle geometry, quantitative comparison to theory and simulation will require more precise control over the system geometry and dimensionality~\cite{joshimorpho, joshi2023effect}, both in experiments and in the model, along with a more detailed treatment of the microscopic processes underlying fracturing~\cite{lai2018probing,kuna2013finite, mao2018theory,wang2012delayed, mao2018theory, baumberger2020environmental, yang2022rate}. Moreover, many more experimental trials near this threshold and with hydrogels of varying mechanical properties, along with high-resolution imaging of crack propagation~\cite{leslie2021gel}, will be useful in characterizing the details of the fracturing process, which likely depend on the presence of microscopic imperfections in the hydrogel. Finally, although here we restricted our attention to the case of rigid obstacles, many scenarios involve growth/expansion around \emph{compliant} constraints---e.g., the development of biofilms, tissues, and organs in the body~\cite{helmlinger1997solid, zhang2021morphogenesis, fortune2022biofilm,goodwin2019smooth}, with potential implications for biological function~\cite{mobius2015obstacles, atis2019microbial}. Extending our study to the case of deformable obstacles would therefore be a useful direction for future work.

Our results may be especially relevant to diverse applications of hydrogels, and other swellable materials, that frequently involve their confinement in tight and tortuous spaces. For example, driven by growing demands for food and water, hydrogels are increasingly being explored as additives to soils to absorb and release water to plants and therefore reduce the burden for irrigation~\cite{misiewicz2022characteristics, woodhouse1991effect, demitri2013potential, guilherme2015superabsorbent, lejcus2018swelling}. They are also widely adopted in other applications, such as oil recovery, construction, mechanobiology, and filtration, all of which involve hydrogel swelling in confinement~\cite{krafcik2017improved, kapur1996hydrodynamic, dolega2017cell, lee2019dispersible}. A common assumption made in all these cases is that the hydrogel retains integrity as it swells; however, our study indicates that these applications should be evaluated for the possibility of swelling-induced self-fracture. Indeed, fracture could lead to the production and dispersal of many small hydrogel fragments, potentially reducing their utility and leading to environmental contamination. This process should therefore be carefully considered in a wide range of real-world contexts. 


\section*{Materials and Methods}
\subsubsection*{Experimental details}
To create the obstacle array, we 3D print cylindrical columns in Clear v4 resin using a Form3+ industrial 3D printer (Formlabs), and cut the acrylic plates using an Epilog Laser Mini 24 laser cutter and engraving system.  We secure the columns to the acrylic plates using a twist-and-lock mechanism. The hydrogels are polyacrylamide beads (``water gel beads" obtained from Jangostor) and are stored in a screw cap container prior to experiments; as such, they experience some slight swelling due to ambient humidity. The hydrogel beads have varying sizes and colors, but all appear to have the same swelling behavior and beads of similar sizes are used for experiments (SI Appendix A). These hydrogel beads were extensively characterized in our previous experiments~\cite{louf_under_2021, louf_poroelastic_2021}, which provide additional detail. 

Early in the swelling process (e.g. 2 h in Fig. \ref{fig:schematic}B,C), each hydrogel appears out of focus since it has not yet made contact with the top plate (focal plane for imaging), and cusps are visible on its surface due to differential swelling as water enters the hydrogel from its outer surface~\cite{tanaka1986kinetics, tanaka1987mechanical, bertrand2016dynamics, curatolo2017transient}. We verify that the hydrogel beads swell to an equilibrium shape without rupturing when no obstacles are present (either with or without the 40~mm $z$-confinement), indicating the transient stresses that engender these cusps are insufficient to drive fracture as in other less tough gels~\cite{de2016preparation, leslie2021gel}. Because the plates and obstacles are made of acrylic or a polymeric resin, respectively, we do not expect or see evidence of adhesion between the polyacrylamide hydrogel surface and the confining surfaces. For experiments in which we image the entire process of obstructed swelling, we verify that the hydrogel reaches an equilibrium shape (in the cases of no fracturing) when its size/shape does not noticeably change for at least three hours. In other experiments where we do not image the entire process of obstructed swelling, we verify that equilibrium is reached by waiting an additional 12 hours. Each symbol in Fig. \ref{fig:threshold} represents a single experiment.


\subsubsection*{Simulation details}
We create meshes using FEniCS's built-in mesh generation function with cell size set such that there are 30 vertices along the radius. We confirmed that this mesh resolution was sufficient for numerical convergence. We set $n_p \Omega=0.001$ and $\chi=0.3$. The penalty function is integrated over the hydrogel boundary, and is given by 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{F_{\rm{pen}}}{2 \pi r_0 k_B T}= \frac{p}{4 \pi r_0} \sum_i \langle r_{\rm{obs}}^2-(\*x-\*x_i)^2 \rangle_+^2,
\end{equation}
where $p$ is the penalty strength, $\*x_i$ is position of the center of the $i^{\rm{th}}$ obstacle, $r_0$ is the dry reference radius of the hydrogel, and the sum is over all obstacles. The brackets $\langle \cdots \rangle_+$ take the positive part of the argument, defined as $\langle x \rangle_+= \frac{x + |x|}{2}$. Thus, when evaluated at positions away from any obstacles, the penalty function is zero, but takes a large positive value inside the obstacles. We set $p=6.25 \pi/r_0^4$ to generate the data shown in this text, and have verified that using $p=62.5 \pi/r_0^4$ produces the same results.

Following the suggestions of Refs.~\cite{zhang2009finite, bouklasfem, angbouklas}, we use the backwards Euler scheme for time integration (see SI Appendix E for further discussion of dynamics), Taylor-Hood mixed elements (quadratic elements for the displacement field and linear elements for the chemical potential field), and early time ramping of the chemical potential boundary condition to ensure numerical stability. The Newton-Raphson method is used at each time step, and equilibrium is defined by when zero iterations are required for a step to complete. 

To find the maximum/minimum principal Cauchy stresses, we first calculate the eigenvalues of the stress tensor for a given displacement field. We project these eigenvalue fields onto a function space of discontinuous Lagrange elements of order 1. We then compare the eigenvalues defined on this mesh. The largest positive eigenvalue is the maximum principal (tensile) stress $\sigma_{\rm{max}}$, and the most negative eigenvalue is the minimum principal (compressive) stress, $\sigma_{\rm{min}}$. To find the minimum and maximum stresses beneath an obstacle (data in Fig. \ref{fig:sims1}(E,F)), we instead project the stress tensor onto the vertical line directly beneath the top obstacle. The minimum value of $\sigma_{yy}$ and the maximum value of $\sigma_{xx}$ along this line are plotted as the below top obstacle minimum and maximum stresses respectively.

\subsubsection*{Tension generated by geometric nonlinearity}

We describe the argument leading up to Eq. \eqref{eq:sigxx} in more detail, which demonstrates how tension can appear beneath an obstacle when a nonlinear strain tensor is used. The variation of the integrated St. Venant-Kirchhoff strain-energy function with respect to displacements in terms of the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor is 
\begin{equation}
    \delta W= \int \sigma_{ij}^{PK} \delta u_{ij} dA= \int \sigma_{ij}^{PK}\left(\frac{\partial \delta u_i}{\partial x_j} + \frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_i}\frac{\partial \delta u_k}{\partial x_j} \right) dA.
\end{equation}
Upon integrating by parts, assuming we cannot vary the displacements at the boundaries due to the presence of obstacles, we find
\begin{align}
   & \delta W= \int \left( \frac{\partial \sigma_{ij}^{PK}}{\partial x_j}\delta u_i +\frac{\partial}{\partial x_j}\left(\sigma_{ij}^{PK} \frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_i} \right) \delta u_k\right) dA,  \nonumber \\
    &= \int \left( \frac{\partial \sigma_{ij}^{PK}}{\partial x_j}\delta u_i +\frac{\partial \sigma_{ij}^{PK}}{\partial x_j}\frac{\partial u_k}{\partial x_i} \delta u_k + \sigma_{ij}^{PK} \frac{\partial^2 u_k}{\partial x_i x_j} \delta u_k \right)dA. 
\end{align}
Next, in order to make approximations specific to our geometry, we explicitly list all the terms that appear for a two-dimensional solid. Since we will examine stresses directly beneath an obstacle, we set $\sigma_{xy}^{PK}=0$ by symmetry, yielding:
\begin{align}
    \delta W&\approx\int dA \delta u_x \Bigg( \frac{\partial \sigma_{xx}^{PK}}{\partial x}\left(1+\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial x} \right) +\frac{\partial \sigma_{yy}^{PK}}{\partial y}\frac{\partial u_x}{\partial y}\nonumber \\&+\sigma_{xx}^{PK} \frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial x^2}+\sigma_{yy}^{PK} \frac{\partial^2 u_x}{\partial y^2} \Bigg)  \nonumber\\
    &+ \int dA \delta u_y \Bigg( \frac{\partial \sigma_{yy}^{PK}}{\partial y}\left(1+\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial y}\right) +\frac{\partial \sigma_{xx}^{PK}}{\partial x}\frac{\partial u_y}{\partial x} \nonumber \\&+\sigma_{xx}^{PK} \frac{\partial^2 u_y}{\partial x^2}+\sigma_{yy}^{PK} \frac{\partial^2 u_y}{\partial y^2} \Bigg). 
\end{align}
In equilibrium, the coefficients of $\delta u_x$ and $\delta u_y$ must be zero (in the absence of body forces). We focus our attention on the coefficient of $\delta u_y$. If we consider the internal stresses directly beneath the obstacle, we can set $\partial u_y/\partial x$ to zero by symmetry. We approximate the deformation as an affine contraction in the $y$ direction, which sets $\partial u_y/\partial y\approx \Delta/r^*$ and $\partial^2 u_y/\partial y^2\approx 0$. We assume that the curvature of the $y$ displacement, $\frac{\partial^2 u_y}{\partial x^2}$, is determined by the curvature of the obstacle, $1/r_{\rm{obs}}$. With these substitutions, the equilibrium condition becomes
\begin{equation}
     \frac{\partial \sigma_{yy}^{PK}}{\partial y}\left(1+\frac{\Delta}{r^*} \right)+  \frac{\sigma_{xx}^{PK}}{r_{\rm{obs}}} \approx 0.
\end{equation}
Solving for $\sigma_{xx}^{PK}$, we find
\begin{equation}
    \sigma_{xx}^{PK} \approx -\frac{\partial \sigma_{yy}^{PK}}{\partial y}\left(1+\frac{\Delta}{r^*} \right)r_{\rm{obs}}.\label{eq:sigxx2}
\end{equation}
Just beyond the linear regime, $\sigma_{yy}^{PK}$ should follow the same trends as $\sigma_{yy}$ predicted by the linear theory. In Fig. \ref{fig:contactparams}B, we observe that $\sigma_{yy}$ decreases as $y$ increases ($\partial \sigma_{yy}/\partial y<0$) until it plateaus at $y/r^* \approx 1$. Thus, $\partial \sigma_{yy}/\partial y$ reaches its minimum a small distance away from the obstacle boundary, and our argument predicts that the largest geometric nonlinearity-generated tensions will appear there. This location is indeed where the greatest tensile stresses appear in simulations (arrow in Fig. \ref{fig:sims1}C). We can also compare the magnitude of the tension predicted by Eq. \eqref{eq:sigxx2} using $\sigma_{yy}$ from the linear theory with the tension measured in hydrogel simulations--- however, we find an estimate of the tension that is approximately five times larger than the maximum tension found via simulations and scales more gradually with increasing $\Delta/r^*$. This discrepancy is not surprising given the approximations made in this calculation.
