  "abstract": "In this work, we investigate grid-forming (GFM) control for dc/ac voltage source converters (VSC) under unbalanced system conditions and unbalanced faults. To fully leverage the degrees of freedom of VSCs, we introduce the concept of generalized three-phase GFM control that combines individual GFM controls for every phase with a phase balancing feedback. The proposed control allows trading off voltage and power unbalance under unbalanced conditions, enables current limiting for each phase during unbalanced faults, and reduces to positive sequence GFM droop control in balanced systems. High-fidelity simulations are used to illustrate the properties of the control.",
