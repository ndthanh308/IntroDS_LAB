\section{Conclusion and Future Work}\label{sec:conclusion-future}
We present a reliable model-based planning approach that uses a graph neural network to estimate the goodness of goal-directed high-level actions from both local and non-local information, improving navigation under uncertainty.
Our planning approach takes advantage of non-local information to make informed decisions about how to more quickly reach the goal.
We rely on a graph neural network (GNN) to make these predictions. The GNN consumes a graph representation of the partial map and makes predictions about the goodness of potential routes to the goal.
We demonstrate improved performance on two simulated environments in which non-local information is required to plan well, demonstrating the efficacy of our approach.
% We use GNN on the structural graph of the observed map to estimate the goodness of an action.
% [TODO: mention GNNs]
% We demonstrated in the J-intersection and parallel hallway environment that our approach reaches the goal earlier than the non-learned baseline and the LSP-Local approach because of the ability to estimate from non-local information.
% [TODO :we demonstrated in XYZ environments that our approach improves...]

In future work, we envision passing more complex sensory input to the robot, allowing it to estimate the goodness of its actions using information collected from image sensors or semantically-segmented images.
