  "abstract": "We improve reliable, long-horizon, goal-directed navigation in partially-mapped environments by using non-locally available information to predict the goodness of temporally-extended actions that enter unseen space. Making predictions about where to navigate in general requires non-local information: any observations the robot has seen so far may provide information about the goodness of a particular direction of travel. Building on recent work in learning-augmented model-based planning under uncertainty, we present an approach that can both rely on non-local information to make predictions (via a graph neural network) and is reliable by design: it will always reach its goal, even when learning does not provide accurate predictions. We conduct experiments in three simulated environments in which non-local information is needed to perform well. In our large scale university building environment, generated from real-world floorplans to the scale, we demonstrate a 9.3\\% reduction in cost-to-go compared to a non-learned baseline and a 14.9\\% reduction compared to a learning-informed planner that can only use local information to inform its predictions.",
