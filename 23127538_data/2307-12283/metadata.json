  "abstract": "We study the $J/ψπ$ and $D\\bar{D}^*$ coupled-channel system within a covariant framework. The $J/ψπ$ and $D\\bar{D}^*$ invariant-mass distributions measured at 4.23~GeV and 4.26~GeV by BESIII and the finite-volume energy levels from recent lattice QCD simulations are simultaneously fitted. Phase shifts and inelasticities of the $J/ψπ$ and $D\\bar{D}^*$ scattering are predicted using the resulting amplitudes. Poles corresponding to the $Z_c(3900)$ state are found in the complex energy plane and their couplings with $J/ψπ$ and $D\\bar{D}^*$ are determined. Our results indicate that the current lattice data do not preclude the existence of a physical $Z_c(3900)$ state.",
