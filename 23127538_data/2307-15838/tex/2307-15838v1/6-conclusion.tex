\section{Conclusion}\label{sec: conclusion}
In conclusion, this comprehensive survey offers a thorough investigation of the fundamental concepts in privacy and fairness by examining nearly $200$ works in the field. Our aim is to guide researchers in both academia and industry towards the simultaneous realization of privacy and fairness for individuals and groups in society across all four primary facets of ML, including supervised, unsupervised, semi-supervised, and reinforcement learning. By establishing a solid understanding of privacy and fairness within various ML techniques, we present an exhaustive analysis of how objectives impact one another and identify open questions for the first time. This work emphasizes the focus areas necessary to address the dual objectives in ML, ultimately promoting more responsible and trustworthy decision-making.\\
