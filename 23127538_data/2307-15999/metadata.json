  "abstract": "We present a new strategy for the design of dual-band planar antennas based on metasurfaces (MTSs) in the microwave and millimeter-wave regimes. It is based on a double layer structure obtained by cascading two subwavelength patterned metallic claddings supported by a grounded dielectric slab. Each metallic layer is responsible for controlling radiation at one frequency, and it is engineered to be transparent at the other frequency. Hence, the two metallic layers can be designed independently using the well-established techniques for the design of single-layered MTS antennas. Layers decoupling is achieved by suitably exploiting Foster's reactance theorem, which regulates the frequency response of the impedance sheet modeling the metallic layer. By using the proposed strategy, a dual-band double-layered MTS antenna radiating a circularly polarized broadside beam in two popular frequency bands for climate science applications is designed and numerically verified.",
