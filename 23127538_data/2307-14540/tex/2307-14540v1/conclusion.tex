In this work, we perform the first systematic exploration of the novel usage of lane detection (LD) to defend against lateral-direction attacks in high-level AD localization. We design the first domain-specific LD-based defense, \ld{}, that is capable of both real-time attack \textit{detection} and \textit{response}. Our evaluation on real-world AD sensor traces show that \ld{} is much more effective than directly-adapted physical-invariant based defenses at attack detection with accurate and timely detection. 
We also show that \ld{} can safely stop the vehicle in the current lane upon detection. We implement \ld{} on two open-source high-level AD systems and evaluate its effectiveness under end-to-end driving with closed-loop control in both simulation and the physical world. We also evaluate against two adaptive attacks and find that \ld{} is robust to an idealized stealthy attack that aims to evade detection and the latest LD-side attack targeting the response stage.
