\section{Conclusion}
\label{con}

We improved the overall code coverage by applying a DDQN agent 
that guided a TCN generator network. The DDQN agent was trained
based on the code coverage performance of generated test cases
to predict the next HTML tag in the test case. Our experiments 
have demonstrated how a TCN model can be used
to generate HTML test cases that discover basic blocks not
discovered by the underlying generation based fuzzer. Furthermore,
the results were improved by utilizing a DDQN agent that guided
the TCN model while generating test cases. 

Overall, the proposed system was able to improve the total code
coverage by up 18.9\% compared to the generation based fuzzer
used to generate the baseline. This highlights that the proposed
system is able to improve an existing fuzzer.
