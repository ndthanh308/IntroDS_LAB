  "abstract": "Generation-based fuzz testing can uncover various bugs and security vulnerabilities. However, compared to mutation-based fuzz testing, it takes much longer to develop a well-balanced generator that produces good test cases and decides where to break the underlying structure to exercise new code paths. We propose a novel approach to combine a trained test case generator deep learning model with a double deep Q-network (DDQN) for the first time. The DDQN guides test case creation based on a code coverage signal. Our approach improves the code coverage performance of the underlying generator model by up to 18.5\\% for the Firefox HTML rendering engine compared to the baseline grammar based fuzzer.",
