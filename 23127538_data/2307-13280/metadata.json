  "abstract": "In the framework of metric-affine gravity, we consider the role of the boundary term in Symmetric Teleparallel Gravity assuming $f(Q,B)$ models where $f$ is a smooth function of the non-metricity scalar $Q$ and the related boundary term $B$. Starting from a variational approach, we derive the field equations and compare them with respect to those of $f(Q)$ gravity in the limit of $B\\to0$. It is possible to show that $f(Q,B)=f(Q-B)$ models are dynamically equivalent to $f(R)$ gravity as in the case of teleparallel $f(\\tilde{B}-T)$ gravity (where $B\\neq \\tilde{B}$). Furtherrmore, conservation laws are derived. In this perspective, considering boundary terms in $ f(Q)$ gravity represents the last ingredient towards the Extended Geometric Trinity of Gravity, where $f(R)$, $f(T,\\tilde{B})$, and $f(Q,B)$ can be dealt with under the same standard. We also compare and discuss about the Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term of General Relativity and the boundary term $B$ in $f(Q,B)$ gravity.",
