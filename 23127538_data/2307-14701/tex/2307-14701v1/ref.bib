	abstract = {An assumption-free automatic check of medical images for potentially overseen anomalies would be a valuable assistance for a radiologist. Deep learning and especially Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) have shown great potential in the unsupervised learning of data distributions. In principle, this allows for such a check and even the localization of parts in the image that are most suspicious. Currently, however, the reconstruction-based localization by design requires adjusting the model architecture to the specific problem looked at during evaluation. This contradicts the principle of building assumption-free models. We propose complementing the localization part with a term derived from the Kullback-Leibler (KL)-divergence. For validation, we perform a series of experiments on FashionMNIST as well as on a medical task including {\textgreater}1000 healthy and {\textgreater}250 brain tumor patients. Results show that the proposed formalism outperforms the state of the art VAE-based localization of anomalies across many hyperparameter settings and also shows a competitive max performance.},

	abstract = {We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

In this context, deep learning-based autoencoders have shown great potential in detecting anomalies in medical images.

We address these shortcomings by proposing the context-encoding Variational Autoencoder (ceVAE), which improves both, the sample, as well as pixelwise results.

	abstract = {Deep unsupervised representation learning has recently led to new approaches in the field of Unsupervised Anomaly Detection (UAD) in brain MRI. The main principle behind these works is to learn a model of normal anatomy by learning to compress and recover healthy data. This allows to spot abnormal structures from erroneous recoveries of compressed, potentially anomalous samples. The concept is of great interest to the medical image analysis community as it i) relieves from the need of vast amounts of manually segmented training data---a necessity for and pitfall of current supervised Deep Learning---and ii) theoretically allows to detect arbitrary, even rare pathologies which supervised approaches might fail to find. To date, the experimental design of most works hinders a valid comparison, because i) they are evaluated against different datasets and different pathologies, ii) use different image resolutions and iii) different model architectures with varying complexity. The intent of this work is to establish comparability among recent methods by utilizing a single architecture, a single resolution and the same dataset(s). Besides providing a ranking of the methods, we also try to answer questions like i) how many healthy training subjects are needed to model normality and ii) if the reviewed approaches are also sensitive to domain shift. Further, we identify open challenges and provide suggestions for future community efforts and research directions.},

	volume = {PMLR 102},
	abstract = {Unsupervised lesion detection is a challenging problem that requires accurately estimating normative distributions of healthy anatomy and detecting lesions as outliers without training examples. Recently, this problem has received increased attention from the research community following the advances in unsupervised learning with deep learning. Such advances allow the estimation of high-dimensional distributions, such as normative distributions, with higher accuracy than previous methods.The main approach of the recently proposed methods is to learn a latent-variable model parameterized with networks to approximate the normative distribution using example images showing healthy anatomy, perform prior-projection, i.e. reconstruct the image with lesions using the latent-variable model, and determine lesions based on the differences between the reconstructed and original images. While being promising, the prior-projection step often leads to a large number of false positives. In this work, we approach unsupervised lesion detection as an image restoration problem and propose a probabilistic model that uses a network-based prior as the normative distribution and detect lesions pixel-wise using MAP estimation. The probabilistic model punishes large deviations between restored and original images, reducing false positives in pixel-wise detections. Experiments with gliomas and stroke lesions in brain MRI using publicly available datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods by a substantial margin, +0.13 (AUC), for both glioma and stroke detection. Extensive model analysis confirms the effectiveness of MAP-based image restoration.},

In this paper, we propose a simple yet powerful generative model that learns such discrete representations. Our model, the Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder (VQ-VAE), differs from VAEs in two key ways: the encoder network outputs discrete, rather than continuous, codes; and the prior is learnt rather than static. In order to learn a discrete latent representation, we incorporate ideas from vector quantisation (VQ). Using the VQ method allows the model to circumvent issues of "posterior collapse" -- where the latents are ignored when they are paired with a powerful autoregressive decoder -- typically observed in the VAE framework. Pairing these representations with an autoregressive prior, the model can generate high quality images, videos, and speech as well as doing high quality speaker conversion and unsupervised learning of phonemes, providing further evidence of the utility of the learnt representations.},

Amongst the hardest tasks in medical imaging, detecting such anomalies requires models of the normal brain that combine compactness with the expressivity of the complex, long-range interactions that characterise its structural organisation. These are requirements transformers have arguably greater potential to satisfy than other current candidate architectures, but their application has been inhibited by their demands on data and computational resources. Here we combine the latent representation of vector quantised variational autoencoders with an ensemble of autoregressive transformers to enable unsupervised anomaly detection and segmentation defined by deviation from healthy brain imaging data, achievable at low computational cost, within relative modest data regimes. We compare our method to current state-of-the-art approaches across a series of experiments with 2D and 3D data involving synthetic and real pathological lesions. On real lesions, we train our models on 15,000 radiologically normal participants from UK Biobank and evaluate performance on four different brain MR datasets with small vessel disease, demyelinating lesions, and tumours. We demonstrate superior anomaly detection performance both image-wise and pixel/voxel-wise, achievable without post-processing. These results draw attention to the potential of transformers in this most challenging of imaging tasks.},

When the algorithms encounter cases that deviate from the distribution of the training data, they often produce incorrect and over-confident predictions. OoD detection algorithms aim to catch erroneous predictions in advance by analysing the data distribution and detecting potential instances of failure. Moreover, flagging OoD cases may support human readers in identifying incidental findings. Due to the increased interest in OoD algorithms, benchmarks for different domains have recently been established. In the medical imaging domain, for which reliable predictions are often essential, an open benchmark has been missing. We introduce the Medical-Out-Of-Distribution-Analysis-Challenge (MOOD) as an open, fair, and unbiased benchmark for OoD methods in the medical imaging domain. The analysis of the submitted algorithms shows that performance has a strong positive correlation with the perceived difficulty, and that all algorithms show a high variance for different anomalies, making it yet hard to recommend them for clinical practice. We also see a strong correlation between challenge ranking and performance on a simple toy test set, indicating that this might be a valuable addition as a proxy dataset during anomaly detection algorithm development.},

	abstract = {Detecting image anomalies automatically in industrial scenarios can improve economic efficiency, but the scarcity of anomalous samples increases the challenge of the task. Recently, autoencoder has been widely used in image anomaly detection without using anomalous images during training. However, it is hard to determine the proper dimensionality of the latent space, and it often leads to unwanted reconstructions of the anomalous parts. To solve this problem, we propose a novel method based on the autoencoder. In this method, the latent space of the autoencoder is estimated using a discrete probability model. With the estimated probability model, the anomalous components in the latent space can be well excluded and undesirable reconstruction of the anomalous parts can be avoided. Specifically, we first adopt VQ-VAE as the reconstruction model to get a discrete latent space of normal samples. Then, PixelSail, a deep autoregressive model, is used to estimate the probability model of the discrete latent space. In the detection stage, the autoregressive model will determine the parts that deviate from the normal distribution in the input latent space. Then, the deviation code will be resampled from the normal distribution and decoded to yield a restored image, which is closest to the anomaly input. The anomaly is then detected by comparing the difference between the restored image and the anomaly image. Our proposed method is evaluated on the high-resolution industrial inspection image datasets MVTec AD which consist of 15 categories. The results show that the AUROC of the model improves by 15\% over autoencoder and also yields competitive performance compared with state-of-the-art methods.},
