Our proposed approach provides low budget advertisers a way to stage products digitally without having to spend on the physical resources needed for staging. Staging a room can easily cost up to few hundred dollars for an advertiser, and with image generation methods like the ones we have proposed, this would be basically free of cost (except for the legalities around copying backgrounds from other images). Leveraging the recent progress in prompt based image generation models, our approach can be further improved along the following lines: backgrounds from similar images could be used to generate prompts which then generate the background of the original product image. In addition, staged ads and parallax animations are expected to drive user engagement, and validating such hypothesis via an A/B test is one of our next steps.
