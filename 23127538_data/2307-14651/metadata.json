  "abstract": "The misuse of law by women in India is a serious issue that has been receiving increased attention in recent years. In India, women are often discriminated against and are not provided with equal rights and opportunities, leading to a gender bias in many aspects of life. This gender bias is further exacerbated by the misuse of law by women. There are numerous instances of women using the law to their advantage, often at the expense of men. This practice is not only unethical but also unconstitutional. The Indian Constitution does not explicitly guarantee gender equality. However, several amendments have been made to the Constitution to ensure that women are treated equally in accordance with the law. The protection of women from all forms of discrimination is considered a fundamental right. Despite this, women continue to be discriminated against in various spheres of life, including marriage, education, employment and other areas. The misuse of law by women in India is primarily seen in cases of domestic violence and dowry-related issues and are punishable by law. However, women often file false dowry harassment cases against their husbands or in-laws in order to gain an advantage in a divorce or property dispute.",
