This paper introduces \texttt{vox2vec} --- a contrastive method for self-supervised learning (SSL) of voxel-level representations. \texttt{vox2vec} representations are modeled by a Feature Pyramid Network (FPN): a voxel representation is a concatenation of the corresponding feature vectors from different pyramid levels. The FPN is pre-trained to produce similar representations for the same voxel in different augmented contexts and distinctive representations for different voxels. This results in unified multi-scale representations that capture both global semantics (e.g., body part) and local semantics (e.g., different small organs or healthy versus tumor tissue). We use \texttt{vox2vec} to pre-train a FPN on more than 6500 publicly available computed tomography images. We evaluate the pre-trained representations by attaching simple heads on top of them and training the resulting models for 22 segmentation tasks. We show that \texttt{vox2vec} outperforms existing medical imaging SSL techniques in three evaluation setups: linear and non-linear probing and end-to-end fine-tuning. Moreover, a non-linear head trained on top of the frozen \texttt{vox2vec} representations achieves competitive performance with the FPN trained from scratch while having $50$ times fewer trainable parameters. The code is available at \url{https://github.com/mishgon/vox2vec}.
