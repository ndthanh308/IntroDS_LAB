Multilayer networks have become a recent focal point of research in the field of statistical network analysis  
\citep[e.g.,][]{LeChLy20, CaGo20, arroyo_multi, KrKoMa20, chen2022, sosa2022, huang2022},
arising in applications where a common set of elements of a population of interest 
have multiple modes of interaction with or relation to other elements in the population.
A prototypical example in the literature might be the Lazega law firm network \citep{Lazega2001}, 
in which attorneys within a law firm have multiple modes of linkage,
which include advice seeking, friendship, collaboration, etc.,
each of which would form individual layers of the multilayer network  \citep{KrKoMa20}.  
A multilayer network is therefore a composite of multiple individual networks,
each defined by a distinct mode of interaction or relation.  


Often, 
edges in one layer may depend on edges in another layer, 
giving rise to what we call cross-layer dependence. 
Understanding drivers of edge formation in multilayer networks requires 
learning  dependence structures of the layers of multilayer networks. 
A key challenge lies in the fact that the cross-layer dependence can be varied and complex. 
In this work, 
we present a novel modeling framework for multilayer networks which provides a flexible platform for extending 
single-layer network models to multilayer networks,
with the primary goal of learning cross-layer dependence structures of multilayer networks. 
A key advantage of our framework is that we are able to account for and separate out the network formation process  
from the layer formation process,
enabling us to create a wide-range of novel classes of multilayer network models 
by extending popular classes of network models 
(e.g., exponential-family random graph models, stochastic block models, latent space models),
and employing Markov random field specifications to develop flexible and comprehensive 
models of cross-layer dependence in multilayer networks. 
As a result, 
we are able to jointly model both network structure and cross-layer dependence through what we refer to as a network separable 
framework for modeling multilayer networks. 


Our main contributions in this work include: 
\ben
\item Introducing a novel framework for modeling 
cross-layer dependence in multilayer networks 
that synchronizes with current network models in the literature.
\item Deriving non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees in scenarios where the number of parameters tends to infinity, 
which establishes bounds on the:  
\ben
\item Statistical error of both maximum likelihood and pseudolikelihood estimators.  
\item Error of the multivariate normal approximation of estimators.
\een
\item Elaborate a model selection algorithm which controls the false discovery rate.
