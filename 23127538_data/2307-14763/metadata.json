  "abstract": "The aim of this paper consists of providing summation formulas for the $k$-Fibonacci numbers ($k \\in \\mathbb{Z}$, $k \\geq 2$) and their asymptotic equivalents in terms of generalized binomial coefficients. Our main tools are the Lagrange inversion formula and one of its consequences due to Hermite.",
