\begin{abstract}
Rotation, which stabilizes flow, can enhance the heat transfer in Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC) due to Ekman pumping. In this Letter, we study this heat transfer enhancement by conducting direct numerical simulations of rotating RBC for a wide range of parameters: Rayleigh number ($Ra$) from $2\times 10^4$ to $2\times 10^{10}$, Prandtl number ($Pr$) from $1$ to $1000$, and Taylor number ($Ta$) from 0 to $2\times 10^{12}$. We show that for each $Ra$, there exists a critical Prandtl number ($Pr_{cr}$) below which no heat transfer enhancement occurs at any rotation rate, as well as an optimal Prandtl number ($Pr_{opt}$) at which maximum heat transfer enhancement occurs at an optimal rotation rate. We demonstrate a significant heat transfer enhancement for $Ra$ up to $2\times 10^{10}$ and predict that heat transfer enhancement due to rotation not only would occur at $Ra>10^{10}$ but would also become more pronounced.

\maketitle
Thermal convection manifests across a broad spectrum of scales, ranging from the cooling of electronic devices to geophysical and astrophysical flows. To study the key characteristics of thermal convection, such as heat and momentum transfer, a simplified model known as Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC) is commonly employed. Within the framework of RBC, fluid motion occurs between a hot plate (at the bottom) and a cold plate (at the top) as a consequence of the thermal buoyancy force~\cite{Chandrasekhar:book:Instability, Drazin:bookHydrodynamic_stability}. The behavior of RBC system is primarily determined by two dimensionless parameters: the Rayleigh number ($Ra = g\beta\Delta H^3 /\nu\kappa$), which represents the strength of the buoyancy forcing, and the Prandtl number ($Pr=\nu/\kappa$), which represents the ratio of the momentum diffusivity to thermal diffusivity; here, $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity, $\beta$ is the thermal expansion coefficient, $\Delta$ is the temperature difference between the hot and cold plates, $H$ is the separation between the plates, $\nu$ is the kinematic viscosity, and $\kappa$ is the thermal diffusivity. In RBC research, the primary focus is on the heat transfer and flow intensity, quantified by the Nusselt number ($Nu$) and the Reynolds number ($Re$), respectively, and their scaling with $Ra$ and $Pr$~\cite{Shraiman:PRA1990, Grossmann:JFM2000, Niemela:Nature2000, Chilla:EPJE2012}.

Incorporating background rotation into a thermal convection system makes it relevant to various flows occurring within the Earth’s outer core~\cite{ Glatzmaier:Nature1995}, oceans~\cite{Marshall:RGP1999}, gaseous planets like Jupiter~\cite{Ingersoll:Science1990, Heimpel:Nature2005}, and solar interiors~\cite{Spiegel:ARAA1971}. An RBC system with background rotation parallel to the gravitational force is known as rotating RBC. Rotation, which introduces the Coriolis force in a convective system, significantly affects its heat and momentum transfer characteristics~\cite{Rossby:JFM1969}. The strength of the Coriolis force relative to the viscous force is represented by the dimensionless parameter Taylor number ($Ta=4\Omega^2H^4/\nu^2$); here, $\Omega$ represents the rotation rate of the system. To characterize the relative strength of convection over rotation, convective Rossby number $Ro=\sqrt{Ra/TaPr}$ is commonly used. When $Ro\gg 1$, buoyancy force dominates over the Coriolis force, and the properties of a rotating RBC system closely resemble those of non-rotating RBC~\cite{King:Nature2008, King:JFM2012, Stevens:PRL2013}. On the other hand, when $Ro\ll 1$, rotation becomes dominant and rotating convection exhibits similarities to geostrophic flow, which is characterized by a force balance between pressure gradient and the Coriolis force~\cite{King:Nature2008, Kunnen:JT2021, Ecke:ARFM2023}.

Typically, rotation suppresses the intensity of flow; consequently, the heat transfer is also reduced~~\cite{Niemela:JFM2010, Ecke:PRL2014, Stellmach:PRL2014}. However, it is observed, both in experiments and simulations, that for a certain range of parameters, rotation can also enhance the heat transfer~\cite{Rossby:JFM1969, Zhong:JFM1993, Liu:PRL1997, Kunnen:PRE2006, Stevens:EJMFB2013, Ping:PRL2015, Zhong:PRL2009RotatingRBC, Stevens:PRL2013, Yang:PRF2020, Vorobieff:JFM2002, Stevens:PRL2009, Stevens:NJP2010, Stevens:POF2010, Stevens:PRE2011, Joshi:JFM2017, Weiss:PRL2010, Weiss:PRE2016, Chong:PRL2017}. This heat transfer enhancement in rotating RBC as compared to the non-rotating case is ascribed to Ekman pumping~\cite{Julien:JFM1996, Kunnen:PRE2006, Zhong:PRL2009RotatingRBC}. There are, however, many studies which report no or negligible enhancement in heat transfer due to rotation at low $Pr$ or high $Ra$, e.g., \citet{Pfotenhauer:JFM1984} for $Pr\approx 0.5$ at low $Ra$, and \citet{Ecke:PRL2014} for $Pr=0.7$, $4\times 10^9<Ra<4\times 10^{11}$, and $4\times 10^9<Ta<1\times 10^{14}$. In particular, several studies have reported no or negligible heat transfer enhancement for $Ra\gtrsim 10^{10}$: \citet{Niemela:JFM2010} (for $Pr=0.7-5.9$), \citet{Stellmach:PRL2014} (for $Pr\approx 1-7$), \citet{Kunnen:JFM2016} (for $Pr=1$), and \citet{Hartmann:arxiv2023} (for $Pr = 4.38$ and $6.4$). The findings of these studies have led to a common expectation that there would be no or negligible heat transfer enhancement due to rotation for $Ra\gtrsim 10^{10}$~\cite{Kunnen:JT2021, Ecke:ARFM2023}.

In this Letter, however, we demonstrate a clear evidence of significant heat transfer enhancement due to rotation even at $Ra\ge 10^{10}$. We show that for each $Ra$ (at least within the range of $Ra=2\times 10^4-2\times 10^{10}$ explored in the present work), significant heat transfer enhancement will occur only if the Prandtl number is greater than a critical Prandtl number $Pr_{cr}$ that increases with increasing $Ra$. For $Ra = 10^{10}$, $Pr_{cr}\approx 10$, which is greater than $Pr$ used in most previous studies that failed to observe any or significant enhancement in the heat transfer for $Ra\gtrsim 10^{10}$. In this work, we also provide a precise definition of the optimal Prandtl number $Pr_{opt}$ for obtaining the maximum heat transfer enhancement at a given $Ra$ and show that $Pr_{opt}$ also increases with $Ra$. Furthermore, we emphasize that $Ta$ serves as a better parameter compared to $1/Ro$ in representing the optimal rotation rate at which the maximum enhancement occurs. Finally, we show that the maximum enhancement in heat transfer at $Pr_{opt}$ exhibits a monotonic increase with $Ra$. Importantly, the present findings predict that heat transfer enhancement due to rotation not only would occur but also would become more pronounced at $Ra>10^{10}$.

For this study, we perform a large number (more than $400$) of direct numerical simulations (DNS) for a wide range of parameters: $Ra=2\times 10^4-2\times 10^{10}$, $Pr=1-1000$, and $Ta=0-2\times 10^{12}$. We perform simulations in a horizontally periodic rectangular domain of size $L\times L\times H$ ($L\times L$ in the horizontal directions and $H$ along the vertical) employing isothermal and no-slip (and impenetrable) boundary conditions at the top (cold) and bottom (hot) plates. For the simulations of non-rotating RBC ($Ta=0$) at moderate Ra, we use large aspect ratio ($\Gamma=L/H$) to avoid the effect of confinement on the Nusselt number~\cite{Huang:PRL2013}: $\Gamma=8$ for $Ra=2\times 10^4-10^6$ and $\Gamma=4$ for $Ra=10^7-10^8$. Considering the high computational cost at large $\Gamma$ for high $Ra$, we use $\Gamma=1$ for $Ra=5\times 10^8-2.3\times 10^9$ and $\Gamma= 0.5$ for $Ra=10^{10}$. We use $Nu\approx 0.12Ra^{0.30}$ (which we obtain by fitting the $Nu$ data for $Ra=10^6-10^{10}$ at $Pr=100$) to estimate $Nu\approx 148$ for $Ra=2\times 10^{10}$ and $Pr=100$. Since the horizontal length scale of the flow in rotating convection, $\ell_c$, decreases with $Ta$ as $\ell_c=2.4Ta^{-1/6}H$~\cite{Chandrasekhar:book:Instability}, we use relatively lower aspect ratios (half or one-fourth of those for the corresponding non-rotating RBC cases) for some simulations of rotating RBC. In all simulations, we ensure $\ell_c/L\lesssim 1/8$ to mitigate the nonphysical effects arising due to the periodic boundaries in the horizontal directions~\cite{Kunnen:JFM2016, Julien:JFM1996}. For more details about the simulations and the solver used in this study, please refer to the Supplementary Material~\cite{SM:ThisPaper}.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:Nu_Ta_Ro}, we show the variation of the normalized Nusselt number $Nu/Nu_0$ ($Nu_0$ is the Nusselt number for the non-rotating case) with the Taylor number, $Ta$, and the inverse of the Rossby number, $1/Ro$, for $Pr=1-1000$ at $Ra=[10^7, 10^8, 10^9, 10^{10}]$. We observe that when $Pr$ is not too small, $Nu/Nu_0$ first increases and then decreases as the rotation rate is increased. For each $Ra$, the maximum enhancement in the heat transfer as compared to the non-rotating case occurs in a certain range of $Pr$ and rotation rate. This maximum enhancement increases with increasing $Ra$ and can reach up to approximately $25\%$, $40\%$, and $55\%$ for $Ra=10^7$, $Ra=10^8$, and $Ra=10^9$, respectively. Note that we observe a significant heat transfer enhancement (more than $40\%$) even at $Ra=10^{10}$, which will be discussed later in greater detail. We also observe that the Taylor number $Ta$ serves as a better parameter than $1/Ro$ in representing the optimal rotation rate at which the maximum enhancement occurs. Unlike the optimal rotation rate represented in terms of the inverse of Rossby number, ($1/Ro_{opt}$), the optimal Taylor number, $Ta_{opt}$, is nearly independent of $Pr$ when significant enhancement is observed at a given $Ra$. Most earlier studies used $1/Ro_{opt}$ to represent the optimal rotation rate but found $1/Ro_{opt}$ to be strongly dependent on $Pr$~\cite{Zhong:PRL2009RotatingRBC, Stevens:NJP2010, Yang:PRF2020}. Since the heat transfer enhancement due to rotation is largely controlled by the dynamics of the Ekman boundary layer~\cite{Stellmach:PRL2014}, the thickness of which depends only on the Taylor number (which represents the ratio of Coriolis to viscous forces), $Ta$ can be expected to represent better the heat transfer enhancement than $1/Ro$ (which represents the ratio of Coriolis to buoyancy forces) at moderate and high rotation rates. This finding is also in line with the hypothesis of ~\citet{King:Nature2008} that the boundary layer controls the rotation-dominated regime in rotating RBC, rather than the balance between the buoyancy and Coriolis forces. Nonetheless, the beginning of the rotation-affected regime, i.e., the rotation rate at which $Nu/Nu_0$ deviates from $1$, is better represented by $1/Ro$ than by $Ta$, as seen from our results. Specifically, for $Ra = 10^7$ and $10^8$, the rotation-affected regime begins at $1/Ro\approx 0.2$, while for $Ra=10^9$, it begins at $1/Ro\approx 0.4$. These values are consistent with the findings of~\citet{Stevens:PRL2009}.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:Taopt_Ra}, we show the variation of $Ta_{opt}$ with $Ra$ for various Prandtl numbers. As discussed earlier, we observe that at a given $Ra$, the optimal Taylor number does not vary significantly with $Pr$. Also, $Ta_{opt}$ follows a power law close to $Ta_{opt}\sim Ra^{1.5}$ up to a certain $Ra$ and this limiting $Ra$ for the power law seems to increase with increasing $Pr$. Note that the Taylor number at which convection ceases completely ($Ta_{cs}$) also follows the scaling $Ta_{cs}\sim Ra^{1.5}$ for $Ta\gg 1$~\cite{Chandrasekhar:book:Instability}. 

In Fig.~\ref{fig:Nuopt_Pr}, we show the variation of normalized maximum Nusselt number, $Nu_{max}/Nu_0$, with $Pr$ for $Ra=2\times 10^4-2\times 10^{10}$. At any given $Ra$ and $Pr$, $Nu_{max}$, by definition, corresponds to the Nusselt number at the optimal Taylor number for that $Ra$ and $Pr$. The maximum heat transfer enhancement represented by $Nu_{max}/Nu_0$ for each $Ra$ increases with $Pr$ up to a certain $Pr$ and then decreases. Note that for each $Ra$ there exists a Prandtl number (obtained by extrapolating the data for each $Ra$ to $Nu_{max}/Nu_0=1$) below which there will be no (or negligible) heat transfer enhancement at any rotation rate. We call this $Pr$ the critical Prandtl number $Pr_{cr}$. In rotating convection, columnar vortical structures are known to play a critical role in the heat transfer by transporting the temperature anomaly from one wall to the other~\cite{Zhong:PRL2009RotatingRBC, Julien:JFM1996}. However, for $Pr<Pr_{cr}$, it is likely that the lateral diffusion of the heat/temperature anomaly away from the vortex columns restricts their ability to transport heat between the top and bottom walls~\cite{Stevens:NJP2010, Hartmann:arxiv2023}. As $Pr$ increases, this effect is expected to weaken, and so the heat transfer increases. However, the heat transfer enhancement decreases again at very large $Pr$. 

At any $Ra$, we define the Prandtl number at which $Nu_{max}/Nu_0$ reaches its maximum as the optimal Prandtl number $Pr_{opt}$ for that $Ra$. Some studies (e.g., \citet{Stevens:NJP2010}), comparing the heat transfer at a constant $Ro$, have proposed that at large $Pr$, the Ekman boundary layer ($\delta_u$) is much thicker than the thermal boundary layer ($\delta_\theta$). Consequently, the columnar vortices do not reach the thermal boundary layer and the fluid entering them is not as hot (or as cold), leading to a decrease in the heat transfer enhancement at large $Pr$. However, we observe that the maximum enhancement (which occurs at $Ta_{opt}$) decreases at large Prandtl number even though $1.3\lesssim \delta_u/\delta_\theta\lesssim 1.5$ for $Pr>Pr_{opt}$ (see Supplementary Material~\cite{SM:ThisPaper}). We hypothesize that the higher viscous damping of the flow at very large $Pr$ weakens the vertical advection of heat by the columnar structures, resulting in maximum heat transfer at an intermediate (optimal) $Pr$.

Here, we make two important observations. First, we observe a significant heat transfer enhancement even at $Ra\ge 10^{10}$: approximately $40\%$ at $Ra=2\times 10^{10}$ for $Pr=100$, and the trends indicate an even higher heat transfer enhancement for higher $Pr$. This finding challenges a common expectation that there will be no (or negligible) heat transfer enhancement due to rotation at $Ra\ge 10^{10}$~\cite{Ecke:ARFM2023, Kunnen:JT2021}. The present results predict that heat transfer enhancement due to rotation is possible even for $Ra>10^{10}$ provided $Pr>Pr_{cr}$. Secondly, we observe a significant heat transfer enhancement ($>10\%$) even at $Ra=2\times 10^4$ (using $\Gamma=8$), in agreement with \citet{Rossby:JFM1969}'s experimental results for $\Gamma\gtrsim 6$. No earlier studies (except \citet{Rossby:JFM1969}) have reported any heat transfer enhancement at such low $Ra$ ($Ra\lesssim 10^6$), perhaps due to the significant effects of lateral confinement on the Nusselt number at low $\Gamma$ ($\Gamma\approx 1$).

In Fig.~\ref{fig:PrcrProptRa}, we show the variation of $Pr_{cr}$ and $Pr_{opt}$ with $Ra$. Interestingly, both $Pr_{cr}$ and $Pr_{opt}$ increase monotonically with $Ra$ and approximately follow power-laws: $Pr_{cr}\approx 1.46\times 10^{-3}Ra^{0.375}$ and $Pr_{opt}\approx 8.18\times 10^{-3}Ra^{0.504}$. Considering the high computational cost at large $Pr$ and large $Ra$, we do not perform simulations at $Pr>200$ to find $Pr_{opt}$ for $Ra=10^{10}$, which is estimated to be $Pr_{opt}\approx 900$ by the above power-law fit. As Rayleigh number increases, the turbulent diffusion of heat is also expected to become stronger. At low $Pr$, this higher turbulent diffusion will combine with the large molecular thermal diffusivity to further increase the lateral diffusion of heat in the bulk, and hence, will decrease the ability of the vortex columns to transport heat. Thus, a correspondingly larger $Pr$ may be necessary to counter this effect of the enhanced turbulent thermal diffusivity to register any enhancement in the heat transfer, i.e., $Pr_{cr}$ will increase with increasing $Ra$. On the other hand, as the buoyancy forcing increases with increasing $Ra$, the viscous damping of the flow at large $Pr$ will become weaker and the heat transfer enhancement can be sustained until larger Prandtl numbers, i.e. $Pr_{opt}$ also increases as $Ra$ is increased. We again note that $Pr_{cr}\approx 10$ for $Ra=10^{10}$, and it further increases with $Ra$. Thus, most earlier studies that used $Pr<10$~\cite{Niemela:JFM2010, Stellmach:PRL2014, Kunnen:JFM2016, Ecke:PRL2014, Hartmann:arxiv2023} failed to observe any (or significant) enhancement in the heat transfer due to rotation for $Ra\gtrsim 10^{10}$.

In Fig.~\ref{fig:NumaxRa}, we show the variation of $Nu_{max}(Pr_{opt})/Nu_0$ with $Ra$. Here, $Nu_{max}(Pr_{opt})$ is $Nu_{max}$ at $Pr=Pr_{opt}$. Again, we observe a clear monotonic increase of $Nu_{max}(Pr_{opt})/Nu_0$ with $Ra$, and the trend can be fitted by a power-law $Nu_{max}(Pr_{opt})/Nu_0\approx 0.62Ra^{0.044}$. This relationship predicts $Nu_{max}/Nu_0\approx 1.7$ (i.e., $70\%$ enhancement in heat transfer) for $Ra=10^{10}$ at $Pr_{opt}\approx 900$, and even higher enhancement at $Ra>10^{10}$ at higher $Pr$. Thus, the present trends predict that the maximum heat transfer enhancement increases with $Ra$, even for $Ra>10^{10}$, provided the Prandtl number is also increased commensurately. As discussed earlier, at a given $Ra$, the enhancement increases with $Pr$ up to $Pr_{opt}$ beyond which the viscous damping of the flow restricts the vertical advection of heat. However, as $Ra$ and hence buoyancy forcing is increased, the enhancement due to rotation can increase up to larger $Pr$ before the viscous damping effect becomes significant. Thus, the maximum enhancement can be expected to increase with $Ra$. 

Note that the effect of finite aspect ratio on $Nu$ in non-rotating simulations~\cite{Huang:PRL2013} may lead to some uncertainty in the values of $Pr_{cr}$ and $Nu_{max}/Nu_0$ for $Ra\ge 5\times 10^8$. However, this effect is expected to not alter any of the major findings of this study.

The present results show that as $Ra$ is increased in rotating RBC, $Pr_{cr}$,  $Pr_{opt}$, as well as the maximum heat transfer enhancement increase. In particular, not only enhancement is certainly possible for $Ra>10^{10}$, but is also expected to be higher than that for lower $Ra$ at the optimal Prandtl number. However, we do not know up to what $Ra$ these trends will persist. Simulations and experiments at significantly higher $Ra$ and $Pr$ than currently feasible may be required to answer this question. 

In closing, we briefly discuss the implications of the present results for identifying the transition from a buoyancy-dominated to a rotation-dominated regime in rotating RBC. Some previous studies have used the heat transfer enhancement (the rotation rate for maximum enhancement or for $Nu/Nu_0=1$) by Ekman pumping to define this transition (see \citet{Ecke:ARFM2023}). However, according to our findings, these criteria fail when $Pr < Pr_{cr}$, for which no enhancement occurs, and unconditionally for free-slip boundary conditions for which there is no Ekman pumping and consequently no enhancement in the heat transfer. \citet{King:Nature2008, King:JFM2012} suggested the ratio of the Ekman and thermal boundary layer thicknesses ($\delta_u/\delta_\theta$) to define the transition from the buoyancy-dominated to the rotation-dominated regime. Although this definition works for $Pr<Pr_{cr}$, it fails for the free-slip boundary conditions, where no Ekman layer exists. It is evident that we still need a more general criterion to define the transition from the buoyancy-dominated regime to the rotation-dominated regime. \\
