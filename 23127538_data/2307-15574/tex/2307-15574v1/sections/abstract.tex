Extended reality (XR) applications require computationally demanding functionalities with low end-to-end latency and high throughput.
To enable XR on commodity devices, a number of distributed systems solutions enable  offloading of XR workloads on remote servers.
However, they make a priori decisions regarding the offloaded functionalities based on assumptions about operating factors, and their benefits are restricted to specific deployment contexts.
To realize the benefits of offloading in various distributed environments, we present a distributed stream processing system, \sys, which is specialized for real-time and interactive workloads and enables flexible distributions of XR functionalities.
In building \sys, we identified and resolved several issues of presenting XR functionalities as distributed pipelines.
\sys\ provides a framework for flexible distribution of XR pipelines while streamlining development and deployment phases.
We evaluate \sys\ with three XR use cases in four different distribution scenarios.
In the results, the best-case distribution scenario shows up to 50\% less end-to-end latency and 3.9\mul\ pipeline throughput compared to alternatives.
