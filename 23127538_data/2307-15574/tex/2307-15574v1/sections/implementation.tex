The current version of \sys\ is implemented and tested on Ubuntu 20.04.
It is written in C++ with STL, and on-node kernel management and communication rely on RaftLib v0.7~\cite{beard2017raftlib}.
For remote communication, \sys\ supports TCP using ZeroMQ~\cite{zeromq}, and RTP communication using uvgRTP~\cite{altonen2020open} which is based on the  RFC 3550 specifications~\cite{schulzrinne2003rfc3550}.
For the application functionalities, we use several components. For object detectors in the AR applications, we use the ArUco~\cite{romero2018speeded} and ORB keypoint detection algorithm of OpenCV4~\cite{opencv4}.
Pose estimation in the VR application is implemented using ORB SLAM3~\cite{campos2021orb} and the EuRoC dataset~\cite{burri2016euroc}.
\sys\ supports the Unreal Engine 5 (UE5)~\cite{unreal} and Unity 3D~\cite{unity3d} game engines, which interface with the \sys\ runtime via plugins.
The \sys\ plugins are compatible with the shared memory port in Figure~\ref{fig:kernel_design} and make it possible to run external applications with \sys\ pipelines.
The graphics rendering in our examples uses the Mesa implementation~\cite{mesa} of OpenGL~\cite{ogl}, EGL~\cite{egl}, and Vulkan~\cite{vulkan}.
For hardware-accelerated encoding and decoding of H.264~\cite{wiegand2003overview}, we use FFmpeg~\cite{ffmpeg}, NVIDIA Video Codec~\cite{nvcodec} on the server, and NVIDIA L4T~\cite{l4t} on Jetson.
