\section{Limitations and Future Work}
\label{sec:limfut}
%------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Even with its benefits, the current version of \sys\ has limitations, and there is future work.
Firstly, we did not explore the effects of different kernel granularities and that tradeoff space.
With the fine-grained kernels, the more parallelism can be achieved, but the benefit of parallelism can be compromised by the resource contentions.
Another limitation is that the current \sys\ does not have a feature to automatically determine how to distribute the entire workload by the environmental parameters such as client device capacity, network state, and the load on the remote server.
Some previous work leveraged linear solvers and resource profilers to make the offloading decisions with the static analysis~\cite{cuervo2010maui, chun2011clonecloud}.
In \sys, it is more complex because the parallel exeution of kernels causes resource contentions and additional overheads can be caused for distributing XR pipelines as described in \S~\ref{sec:evalresanaly}.
So, we put these limitations for future work.
