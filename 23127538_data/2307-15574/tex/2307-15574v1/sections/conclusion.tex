In this work, we describe the limitations of the existing distributed XR systems by their predetermined architectures.
We argue the need of flexibility in XR workload distribution, and the lack of flexibility in distributed XR is attributed to the absence of system supports.
For enabling such flexibility, we present \sys\ -- a DSP system enabling the flexible distribution of XR pipelines at runtime.
We identify the issues of the DSP design for XR and resolve them while building \sys.
In our experiments, \sys\ efficiently enables the four different distribution scenarios to three XR use cases.
Our results show the optimal workload distribution is relatively determined by environmental factors, and \sys\ can realize the effective server assistance for each XR use case in various environments.
