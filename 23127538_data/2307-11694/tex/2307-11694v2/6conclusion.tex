As demonstrated by HIV, HCV, and now cancer, combination therapy is a critical option for disease treatment. Yet, difficulties arise in regards to understanding drug-drug interactions and patient-specific genetic differences. To tackle this, we show that encoder-only language models are effective for drug synergy prediction. We then build on these results by proposing SynerGPT, a decoder model with a novel training strategy for in-context learning which can produce strong results for few-shot drug synergy prediction. We additionally show that the model context can be optimized using non-linear black-box approaches, which has exciting implications for the design of a standardized drug synergy testing panel for creating patient-specific synergy datasets. Finally, we explore a novel task of inverse design using desired drug synergy tuples. Performance on this challenging task is low for unknown drugs; nonetheless, it shows promise for future work that may enable personalized drug discovery. %
