\label{appendix:scaling}
% Figure environment removed

Figure \ref{fig:training_percent} shows how training data scale affects performance. We consider the version of the DrugComb \cite{zagidullin2019drugcomb} dataset for ZIP score regression recently released in the Therapeutic Data Commons software library \cite{huang2021therapeutics}. It contains 129 drugs, 59 cell lines, and 297,098 synergy tuples. The figure shows BERT model validation performance trained using random token inputs.
