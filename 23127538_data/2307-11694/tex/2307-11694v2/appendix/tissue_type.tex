\label{appendix:tissue_type}
We further analyze the results of context optimization by separating the results for unknown drugs into their effects on different tissue types. To obtain tissue types, we use the COSMIC \cite{tate2019cosmic} cancer mutation database. Results (Table \ref{tab:drug_tissue_type}) show that performance varies between different tissue types, but that the context optimized by genetic algorithm outperforms default Unknown-First and the model with no context in all cases with exception of pleura. For example, the model excels predicting synergies in ovarian cancers, but results are lower than average in bone and lymphoid cancers. For example, the ROC-AUC of ovarian cancer increases from 77.6 to 81.6\% with examples selected using the default Unknown-First strategy. Our context optimization strategy also shows to be important-- the ROC-AUC further increases significantly to 87.5 using the examples selected by the genetic algorithm. In the unknown cell line case, we see improvements on all cell lines except skin and bone. Interestingly, performance on bone-derived cell lines is low in both settings. 

While we do analysis by separating model performance into different tissue types in this work (as done in multiple prior studies), we note that for future research it is likely too limiting and simplistic to separate cell lines into tissues types. Future studies may look at better bucketing approaches, such as primary cancer-driving mutations. An excellent example are KRAS mutations, which occurr in up to 25\% of human tumors and in many different tissue types (for KRAS: pancreatic, thyroid, colorectal, and lung carcinomas, among others) \cite{kranenburg2005kras}. Further, we note that while our work focuses on few-shot applications to mono-clonal cell lines and tumor biopsies, there is growing evidence that intra-tumor heterogeneity is a driving factor in cancer growth and is also responsible for drug resistance \cite{black2021genetic}. Future work can investigate the effect that this heterogeneity may have on patient-specific drug synergy prediction.
