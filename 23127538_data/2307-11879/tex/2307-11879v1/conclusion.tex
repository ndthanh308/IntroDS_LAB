In this paper, we have proposed a constrained-based routing algorithm where the metric of interest is the link's security level. The algorithm searches for a feasible path for each incoming flow that respects the latter's minimum level of security requirement. Experimental evaluation with different topologies comprising variable link security levels showcases the performance and pertinence of the proposed approach. The proposed solution runs in polynomial w.r.t. to the size of the network and number of flows. Finally, we have implemented the FARSec approach as a northbound SDN service using the ONOS controller. The service is in charge of monitoring the network, exporting necessary information as input to the FARSec algorithm and installing the paths calculated by the latter.

As for future work, we plan to explore the routing and admission problem with several constraints (e.g., security and capacity, security and latency etc.). Moreover, it is interesting to consider how different parameters affect the hardness of the problem.
