  "abstract": "In this paper we propose and solve a generalization of the Bernoulli Differential Equation, by means of a generalized fractional derivative. First we prove a generalization of Gronwall's inequality, which is useful for studying the stability of systems of fractional differential equations and we state results about the qualitative behavior of the trivial solution of the proposed equation. After that, we prove and state the main results about the solution of the generalized Bernoulli Differential Equation and also we give some examples that show the advantage of considering this fractional derivative approach. We also present a finite difference method as an alternative to the solution of the generalized Bernoulli equation and prove its validity by means of examples.",
