\begin{abstract}
Solid particles, such as rice and coffee beans, are commonly stored in containers and are ubiquitous in our daily lives. Understanding those particles’ properties could help us make later decisions or perform later manipulation tasks such as pouring. Humans typically interact with the containers to get an understanding of the particles inside them, but it is still a challenge for robots to achieve that. This work utilizes tactile sensing to estimate multiple properties of solid particles enclosed in the container, specifically, content mass, content volume, particle size, and particle shape. We design a sequence of robot actions to interact with the container. Based on physical understanding, we extract static force/torque value from the F/T sensor, vibration-related features and topple-related features from the newly designed high-speed GelSight tactile sensor to estimate those four particle properties. We test our method on $37$ very different daily particles, including powder, rice, beans, tablets, etc. Experiments show that our approach is able to estimate content mass with an error of $1.8$ g, content volume with an error of $6.1$ ml, particle size with an error of $1.1$ mm, and achieves an accuracy of $75.6$\% for particle shape estimation. In addition, our method can generalize to unseen particles with unknown volumes. By estimating these particle properties, our method can help robots to better perceive the granular media and help with different manipulation tasks in daily life and industry.

% \begin{abstract}
% Solid particles, such as beans or rice are commonly used\wenzhen{weird wording} in our daily lives. However, it remains a challenge for robots to estimate their properties.\wenzhen{Why robot need to do that?} In fact, the definition of this task itself: selecting the proper descriptor to describe the particle, is an open-problem. \joe{I am not sure the connection between this and the next sentence.} In one hand, human could get a rough estimation about the particles enclosed in the container by interacting with the container, on the other hand, dynamic tactile sensing has been applied to achieve precise estimation on liquid properties.\wenzhen{I can't see the connection between the two sides} This work utilized dynamic tactile sensing to estimate solid particles properties, specifically, particle weight, particle volume, particle size, and particle shape.\wenzhen{You skipped the question of ``defining the task''} We proposed a pipeline to use different actions to activate the whole system to estimate the particle properties step by step. Experiments show that our method could achieve xxg, xx mm, xx, and xx mm for mass estimation, volume estimation, shape estimation, and size estimation individually. In addition, we also show that our method can be generlized to unseen daily particles with unseen volume. Our method can estimate those four properties step by step. By estimating the particle macroscopic property, we believe out method will help robots to better perceive the granular media and help for potential manipulation task for daily life and industry.\wenzhen{The structure of the abstract is confusing and the logics is not coherent. You need to rewrite it}
