\label{sec: conclusion}

In this work, we present an approach to estimate the properties of solid particles in the container. We combine static and dynamic tactile sensing to estimate content mass, content volume, particle size, and particle shape. We design a sequence of exploratory procedures to interact with the container to estimate those four properties. In the experiment, our approach can estimate those properties, achieving an accuracy of $1.8$ g, $6.1$ ml, $1.1$ mm, and $75.6$\% for mass, volume, size, and shape estimation. Additionally, we show that our method can generalize to unseen daily particles with unseen volumes. We also show that the physical-inspired actions and features can be used to estimate sugar humidity. We believe our explorations on solid particle property estimation will help with different manipulation tasks in daily life and industry.
