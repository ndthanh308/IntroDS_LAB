\section{Conclusions}
% In this paper, we propose CoS, a consensus-oriented strategy to promote multi-agent collaboration. First, CoS leverages the vector quantized variational autoencoder to extract the distinguishable and stable group consensus embeddings.
% Furthermore, the embeddings are used to assist global and individual decisions through the proposed group consensus policy and group-guided policy, respectively.
% Empirically, the performance on three benchmarks demonstrates the significance of CoS, the ablation study shows the necessity of combing two policies, and the visualizations further validate the effectiveness of CoS. In the future, it is an interesting direction to investigate universal group embeddings across different tasks.




In this paper, we propose CoS, a novel consensus-oriented strategy to promote multi-agent collaboration. First, CoS leverages the vector quantized variational autoencoder to extract the distinguishable and stable group consensus embeddings. Furthermore, the embeddings are used to assist global and individual decisions through the proposed group consensus policy and group-guided policy, respectively. Our empirical results on three benchmarks show that CoS significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Additionally, the ablation study demonstrates the necessity of combining the two policies, and the visualizations further validate the effectiveness of CoS in promoting collaboration among agents. In the future, it is an interesting direction to investigate universal group embeddings across different tasks.
