@article{AllenS01,
	Abstract = {Leaf-labelled trees are widely used to describe evolutionary relationships, particularly in biology. In this setting, extant species label the leaves of the tree, while the internal vertices correspond to ancestral species. Various techniques exist for reconstructing these evolutionary trees from data, and an important problem is to determine how "far apart" two such reconstructed trees are from each other, or indeed from the true historical tree. To investigate this question requires tree metrics, and these can be induced by operations that rearrange trees locally. Here we investigate three such operations: nearest neighbour interchange (NNI), subtree prune and regraft (SPR), and tree bisection and reconnection (TBR). The SPR operation is of particular interest as it can be used to model biological processes such as horizontal gene transfer and recombination. We count the number of unrooted binary trees one SPR from any given unrooted binary tree, as well as providing new upper and lower bounds for the diameter of the adjacency graph of trees under SPR and TBR. We also show that the problem of computing the minimum number of TBR operations required to transform one tree to another can be reduced to a problem whose size is a function just of the distance between the trees (and not of the size of the two trees), and thereby establish that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable.},

@article{ChenSW16,
	Abstract = {Given a collection of phylogenetic trees on the same leaf label-set, the Maximum Agreement Forest problem (Maf) asks for a largest common subforest of these trees. The Maf problem on two binary phylogenetic trees has been studied extensively. In this paper, we are focused on the Maf problem on multiple (i.e., two or more) binary phylogenetic trees and present two polynomial-time approximation algorithms, one for the Maf problem on multiple rooted trees, and the other for the Maf problem on multiple unrooted trees. The ratio of our algorithm for the Maf problem on multiple rooted trees is 3, which is an improvement over the previous best ratio 8 for the problem. Our approximation algorithm of ratio 4 for the Maf problem on multiple unrooted trees is the first constant ratio approximation algorithm for the problem.},
