  abstract = "The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational
              tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum
              processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge
              is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum
              algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we
              report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting
              qubits2--7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding
              to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016).
              Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting
              probability distribution, which we verify using classical
              simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to
              sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times---our
              benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a
              state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately
              10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all
              known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of
              quantum supremacy8--14 for this specific computational task,

abstract = {Quantum computational advantage or supremacy is a long-anticipated milestone toward practical quantum computers. Recent work claimed to have reached this point, but subsequent work managed to speed up the classical simulation and pointed toward a sample size–dependent loophole. Quantum computational advantage, rather than being a one-shot experimental proof, will be the result of a long-term competition between quantum devices and classical simulation. Zhong et al. sent 50 indistinguishable single-mode squeezed states into a 100-mode ultralow-loss interferometer and sampled the output using 100 high-efficiency single-photon detectors. By obtaining up to 76-photon coincidence, yielding a state space dimension of about 1030, they measured a sampling rate that is about 1014-fold faster than using state-of-the-art classical simulation strategies and supercomputers. Science, this issue p. 1460 Quantum computational advantage is demonstrated using boson sampling with photons. Quantum computers promise to perform certain tasks that are believed to be intractable to classical computers. Boson sampling is such a task and is considered a strong candidate to demonstrate the quantum computational advantage. We performed Gaussian boson sampling by sending 50 indistinguishable single-mode squeezed states into a 100-mode ultralow-loss interferometer with full connectivity and random matrix—the whole optical setup is phase-locked—and sampling the output using 100 high-efficiency single-photon detectors. The obtained samples were validated against plausible hypotheses exploiting thermal states, distinguishable photons, and uniform distribution. The photonic quantum computer, Jiuzhang, generates up to 76 output photon clicks, which yields an output state-space dimension of 1030 and a sampling rate that is faster than using the state-of-the-art simulation strategy and supercomputers by a factor of ~1014.}

The readout fidelity of Zuchongzhi 2.1 is considerably improved to an average of 97.74%. The more powerful quantum processor enables us to achieve larger-scale random quantum circuit sampling, with a system scale of up to 60 qubits and 24 cycles, and fidelity of FXEB=(3.66±0.345)×10-4. The achieved sampling task is about 6 orders of magnitude more difficult than that of Sycamore [Nature 574, 505 (2019)] in the classic simulation, and 3 orders of magnitude more difficult than the sampling task on Zuchongzhi 2.0 [arXiv:2106.14734 (2021)]. The time consumption of classically simulating random circuit sampling experiment using state-of-the-art classical algorithm and supercomputer is extended to tens of thousands of years (about 4.8×104 years), while Zuchongzhi 2.1 only takes about 4.2 h, thereby significantly enhancing the quantum computational advantage.

              algorithms on well-defined tasks. No photonic machine offering
              programmability over all its quantum gates has demonstrated
              quantum computational advantage: previous machines1,2 were
              largely restricted to static gate sequences. Earlier photonic
              demonstrations were also vulnerable to spoofing3, in which
              classical heuristics produce samples, without direct simulation,
              lying closer to the ideal distribution than do samples from the
              quantum hardware. Here we report quantum computational advantage
              using Borealis, a photonic processor offering dynamic
              programmability on all gates implemented. We carry out Gaussian
              boson sampling4 (GBS) on 216 squeezed modes entangled with
              three-dimensional connectivity5, using a time-multiplexed and

  abstract = "A critical question for quantum computing in the near future is
              whether quantum devices without error correction can perform a
              well-defined computational task beyond the capabilities of
              supercomputers. Such a demonstration of what is referred to as
              quantum supremacy requires a reliable evaluation of the resources
              required to solve tasks with classical approaches. Here, we
              propose the task of sampling from the output distribution of
              random quantum circuits as a demonstration of quantum supremacy.
              We extend previous results in computational complexity to argue
              that this sampling task must take exponential time in a classical
              computer. We introduce cross-entropy benchmarking to obtain the
              experimental fidelity of complex multiqubit dynamics. This can be
              estimated and extrapolated to give a success metric for a quantum
              supremacy demonstration. We study the computational cost of
              relevant classical algorithms and conclude that quantum supremacy
              can be achieved with circuits in a two-dimensional lattice of 7
              $\times$ 7 qubits and around 40 clock cycles. This requires an
              error rate of around 0.5\% for two-qubit gates (0.05\% for
              one-qubit gates), and it would demonstrate the basic building

              but logical error rates only decrease with system size when
              physical errors are sufficiently uncorrelated. During
              computation, unused high energy levels of the qubits can become
              excited, creating leakage states that are long-lived and mobile.
              Particularly for superconducting transmon qubits, this leakage
              opens a path to errors that are correlated in space and time.
              Here, we report a reset protocol that returns a qubit to the
              ground state from all relevant higher level states. We test its
              performance with the bit-flip stabilizer code, a simplified
              version of the surface code for quantum error correction. We
              investigate the accumulation and dynamics of leakage during error

  abstract = "Realizing the potential of quantum computing requires
              sufficiently low logical error rates1. Many applications call for
              error rates as low as 10−15 (refs. 2--9), but state-of-the-art
              quantum platforms typically have physical error rates near 10−3
              (refs. 10--14). Quantum error correction15--17 promises to bridge
              this divide by distributing quantum logical information across
              many physical qubits in such a way that errors can be detected
              and corrected. Errors on the encoded logical qubit state can be
              exponentially suppressed as the number of physical qubits grows,
              provided that the physical error rates are below a certain
              threshold and stable over the course of a computation. Here we
              implement one-dimensional repetition codes embedded in a
              two-dimensional grid of superconducting qubits that demonstrate
              exponential suppression of bit-flip or phase-flip errors,
              reducing logical error per round more than 100-fold when
              increasing the number of qubits from 5 to 21. Crucially, this
              error suppression is stable over 50 rounds of error correction.
              We also introduce a method for analysing error correlations with
              high precision, allowing us to characterize error locality while
              performing quantum error correction. Finally, we perform error
              detection with a small logical qubit using the 2D surface code on
              the same device18,19 and show that the results from both one- and
              two-dimensional codes agree with numerical simulations that use a
              simple depolarizing error model. These experimental
              demonstrations provide a foundation for building a scalable
              fault-tolerant quantum computer with superconducting qubits.",

abstract = {Many-body interactions could lead to quantum thermalization, but long-range interactions provide an alternative. Although statistical mechanics describes thermal equilibrium states, these states may or may not emerge dynamically for a subsystem of an isolated quantum many-body system. For instance, quantum systems that are near-integrable usually fail to thermalize in an experimentally realistic time scale, and instead relax to quasi-stationary prethermal states that can be described by statistical mechanics, when approximately conserved quantities are included in a generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). We experimentally study the relaxation dynamics of a chain of up to 22 spins evolving under a long-range transverse-field Ising Hamiltonian following a sudden quench. For sufficiently long-range interactions, the system relaxes to a new type of prethermal state that retains a strong memory of the initial conditions. However, the prethermal state in this case cannot be described by a standard GGE; it rather arises from an emergent double-well potential felt by the spin excitations. This result shows that prethermalization occurs in a broader context than previously thought, and reveals new challenges for a generic understanding of the thermalization of quantum systems, particularly in the presence of long-range interactions.}}

In this paper, the extent to which entangled quantum states over large numbers of qubits can be prepared on current superconducting quantum devices is investigated. Native-graph states on the IBM Quantum 65-qubit ibmq\_manhattan device and the 53-qubit ibmq\_rochester device are prepared and quantum readout-error mitigation (QREM) is applied. Connected entanglement graphs spanning each of the full devices are detected, indicating bipartite entanglement over the whole of each device. The application of QREM is shown to increase the observed entanglement within all measurements, in particular, the detected number of entangled pairs of qubits found within ibmq\_rochester increases from 31 to 56 of the total 58 connected pairs. The results of this work indicate full bipartite entanglement in two of the largest superconducting devices to date.},

ABSTRACT = {Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize the way hard computational problems are solved in terms of speed and accuracy. Quantum hardware is an active area of research and different hardware platforms are being developed. Quantum algorithms target each hardware implementation and bring advantages to specific applications. The focus of this paper is to compare how well quantum annealing techniques and the QAOA models constrained optimization problems. As a use case, a constrained optimization problem called mission covering optimization is used. Quantum annealing is implemented in adiabatic hardware such as D-Wave, and QAOA is implemented in gate-based hardware such as IBM. This effort provides results in terms of cost, timing, constraints held, and qubits used.},

title = {Accelerating the variational quantum eigensolver using parallelism},
journal = {Quantum Science and Technology},
abstract = {Quantum computers are getting larger and larger, but device fidelities may not be able to keep up with the increase in qubit numbers. One way to make use of a large device that has a limited gate depth is to run many small circuits simultaneously. In this paper we detail our investigations into running circuits in parallel on the Rigetti Aspen-M-1 device. We run two-qubit circuits in parallel to solve a simple instance of the Hubbard model using the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE). We present results for running up to 33 circuits in parallel (66 qubits), showing that with the use of error mitigation techniques it is possible to make use of, and gain a real-time speedup from, parallelisation on current quantum hardware. We obtain a speedup by 18× for exploring the VQE energy landscape, and by more than 8× for running VQE optimisation.}

abstract = {Abstract The classification of big data usually requires a mapping onto new data clusters which can then be processed by machine learning algorithms by means of more efficient and feasible linear separators. Recently, Lloyd et al. have advanced the proposal to embed classical data into quantum ones: these live in the more complex Hilbert space where they can get split into linearly separable clusters. Here, these ideas are implemented by engineering two different experimental platforms, based on quantum optics and ultra-cold atoms, respectively, where we adapt and numerically optimize the quantum embedding protocol by deep learning methods, and test it for some trial classical data. A similar analysis is also performed on the Rigetti superconducting quantum computer. Therefore, it is found that the quantum embedding approach successfully works also at the experimental level and, in particular, we show how different platforms could work in a complementary fashion to achieve this task. These studies might pave the way for future investigations on quantum machine learning techniques especially based on hybrid quantum technologies.},

title={Suppressing quantum errors by scaling a surface code logical qubit},

abstract={Practical quantum computing will require error rates well below those achievable with physical qubits. Quantum error correction1,2 offers a path to algorithmically relevant error rates by encoding logical qubits within many physical qubits, for which increasing the number of physical qubits enhances protection against physical errors. However, introducing more qubits also increases the number of error sources, so the density of errors must be sufficiently low for logical performance to improve with increasing code size. Here we report the measurement of logical qubit performance scaling across several code sizes, and demonstrate that our system of superconducting qubits has sufficient performance to overcome the additional errors from increasing qubit number. We find that our distance-5 surface code logical qubit modestly outperforms an ensemble of distance-3 logical qubits on average, in terms of both logical error probability over 25 cycles and logical error per cycle ((2.914{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.016){\%} compared to (3.028{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}0.023){\%}). To investigate damaging, low-probability error sources, we run a distance-25 repetition code and observe a 1.7{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}10−6 logical error per cycle floor set by a single high-energy event (1.6{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}10−7 excluding this event). We accurately model our experiment, extracting error budgets that highlight the biggest challenges for future systems. These results mark an experimental demonstration in which quantum error correction begins to improve performance with increasing qubit number, illuminating the path to reaching the logical error rates required for computation.},

abstract = {Quantum technology promises to revolutionize how we learn about the physical world. An experiment that processes quantum data with a quantum computer could have substantial advantages over conventional experiments in which quantum states are measured and outcomes are processed with a classical computer. We proved that quantum machines could learn from exponentially fewer experiments than the number required by conventional experiments. This exponential advantage is shown for predicting properties of physical systems, performing quantum principal component analysis, and learning about physical dynamics. Furthermore, the quantum resources needed for achieving an exponential advantage are quite modest in some cases. Conducting experiments with 40 superconducting qubits and 1300 quantum gates, we demonstrated that a substantial quantum advantage is possible with today’s quantum processors. There is considerable interest in extending the recent success of quantum computers in outperforming their conventional classical counterparts (quantum advantage) from some model mathematical problems to more meaningful tasks. Huang et al. show how manipulating multiple quantum states can provide an exponential advantage over classical processing of measurements of single-quantum states for certain learning tasks. These include predicting properties of physical systems, performing quantum principal component analysis on noisy states, and learning approximate models of physical dynamics (see the Perspective by Dunjko). In their proof-of-principle experiments using up to 40 qubits on a Google Sycamore quantum processor, the authors achieved almost four orders of magnitude of reduction in the required number of experiments over the best-known classical lower bounds. —YS Quantum-enhanced strategies can provide a dramatic performance boost in learning useful information from quantum experiments.}}

To make combinatorial optimization more efficient, we introduce the filtering variational quantum eigensolver which utilizes filtering operators to achieve faster and more reliable convergence to the optimal solution. Additionally we explore the use of causal cones to reduce the number of qubits required on a quantum computer. Using random weighted MaxCut problems, we numerically analyze our methods and show that they perform better than the original VQE algorithm and the quantum approximate optimization algorithm. We also demonstrate the experimental feasibility of our algorithms on a Quantinuum trapped-ion quantum processor powered by Honeywell.}
