In this paper, we set out to answer the question "Can quantum computing improve uniform random sampling of large configuration spaces?"
To answer this question, we provided a quantum-enabled uniform random sampling method based on Grover's search algorithm that, in theory, allows us to uniformly and randomly sample configurations.
The input to our method is a feature model transformed into a CNF Boolean representation.
In the evaluation, we confirmed challenges for current NISQ-era quantum hardware to solve realistic problem instances. We discussed the feasibility, uniformity, and scalability for our approach for current quantum hardware and simulators.
To summarize, quantum computing seems a promising prospect to improve uniform random sampling of large configuration spaces, especially with true randomness. However, advances in quantum hardware are necessary for our method to compete with and potentially outperform classical uniform random sampling approaches.
