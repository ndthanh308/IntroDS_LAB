abstract = {We present BURST, a benchmarking platform for uniform random sampling techniques. With BURST, researchers have a flexible, controlled environment in which they can evaluate the scalability and uniformity of their sampling. BURST comes with an extensive --- and extensible --- benchmark dataset comprising 128 feature models, including challenging, real-world models of the Linux kernel. BURST takes as inputs a sampling tool, a set of feature models and a sampling budget. It automatically translates any feature model of the set in DIMACS and invokes the sampling tool to generate the budgeted number of samples. To evaluate the scalability of the sampling tool, BURST measures the time the tool needs to produce the requested sample. To evaluate the uniformity of the produced sample, BURST integrates the state-of-the-art and proven statistical test Barbarik. We envision BURST to become the starting point of a standardisation initiative of sampling tool evaluation. Given the huge interest of research for sampling algorithms and tools, this initiative would have the potential to reach and crosscut multiple research communities including AI, ML, SAT and SPL.},

Instead, we randomly sample and recursively search a configuration space directly to find near-optimal configurations without constructing a prediction model.

US means that every (legal) configuration is equally likely to be selected. US yields statistically representative samples of a configuration space and can be used as a baseline to compare other sampling algorithms.We used existing algorithm called Smarch to uniformly sample SPL configurations. While uniform sampling alone was not enough to produce 100\% 1-wise and 2-wise coverage, we used standard probabilistic analysis to explain our experimental results and to conjecture how uniform sampling may enhance the scalability of existing t-wise sampling algorithms.},

abstract = {Several relevant analyses on configurable software systems remain intractable because they require examining vast and highly-constrained configuration spaces. Those analyses could be addressed through statistical inference, i.e., working with a much more tractable sample that later supports generalizing the results obtained to the entire configuration space. To make this possible, the laws of statistical inference impose an indispensable requirement: each member of the population must be equally likely to be included in the sample, i.e., the sampling process needs to be "uniform". Various SAT-samplers have been developed for generating uniform random samples at a reasonable computational cost. Unfortunately, there is a lack of experimental validation over large configuration models to show whether the samplers indeed produce genuine uniform samples or not. This paper (i) presents a new statistical test to verify to what extent samplers accomplish uniformity and (ii) reports the evaluation of four state-of-the-art samplers: Spur, QuickSampler, Unigen2, and Smarch. According to our experimental results, only Spur satisfies both scalability and uniformity.},

abstract="Constrained-random verification (CRV) is widely used in industry for validating hardware designs. The effectiveness of CRV depends on the uniformity of test stimuli generated from a given set of constraints. Most existing techniques sacrifice either uniformity or scalability when generating stimuli. While recent work based on random hash functions has shown that it is possible to generate almost uniform stimuli from constraints with 100,000+ variables, the performance still falls short of today's industrial requirements. In this paper, we focus on pushing the performance frontier of uniform stimulus generation further. We present a random hashing-based, easily parallelizable algorithm, UniGen2, for sampling solutions of propositional constraints. UniGen2 provides strong and relevant theoretical guarantees in the context of CRV, while also offering significantly improved performance compared to existing almost-uniform generators. Experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks show that UniGen2 achieves an average speedup of about 20{\texttimes} over a state-of-the-art sampling algorithm, even when running on a single core. Moreover, experiments with multiple cores show that UniGen2 achieves a near-linear speedup in the number of cores, thereby boosting performance even further.",

We evaluate QuickSampler on large real-world benchmarks and show that it can produce unique valid solutions orders of magnitude faster than other state-of-the-art sampling tools, with a distribution which is reasonably close to uniform in practice.},

We propose a new sampling technique that, while enforcing a uniform exploration of the search space, leverages the reasoning power of a systematic constraint solver in a black-box scheme. We present a series of challenging domains, such as energy barriers and highly asymmetric spaces, that reveal the difficulties introduced by hard constraints. We demonstrate that standard approaches such as Simulated Annealing and Gibbs Sampling are greatly affected, while our new technique can overcome many of these difficulties. Finally, we show that our sampling scheme naturally defines a new approximate model counting technique, which we empirically show to be very accurate on a range of benchmark problems.},
