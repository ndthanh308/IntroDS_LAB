\section{Conclusion}
This work proposes two novel modules for unsupervised deformable image registration: the Feature-wise Diffusion-Guided module (FDG) and the Score-wise Diffusion-Guided module (SDG). Among these modules, FDG can effectively guide the deformation field generation by utilizing the multi-scale intermediate diffusion features. SDG demonstrates its ability to guide the optimization process for better deformation topology preservation using the diffusion score. Extensive experiments show that the proposed framework brings impressive improvements over all baselines. The proposed work models the non-linear deformation semantics using the diffusion model. Therefore, it is sound to generalize to other registration tasks and images, which may be one of the future research directions.
