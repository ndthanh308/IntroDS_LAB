  "abstract": "We study a class of nonlinear nonlocal conservation laws with discontinuous flux, modeling crowd dynamics and traffic flow, without any additional conditions on finiteness/discreteness of the set of discontinuities or on the monotonicity of the kernel/the discontinuous coefficient. Strong compactness of the Godunov and Lax-Friedrichs type approximations is proved, providing the existence of entropy solutions. A proof of the uniqueness of the adapted entropy solutions is provided, establishing the convergence of the entire sequence of finite volume approximations to the adapted entropy solution. As per the current literature, this is the first well-posedness result for the aforesaid class and connects the theory of nonlocal conservation laws (with discontinuous flux), with its local counterpart in a generic setup. Some numerical examples are presented to display the performance of the schemes and explore the limiting behavior of these nonlocal conservation laws to their local counterparts.",
