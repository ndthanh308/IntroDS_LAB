\section{Conclusion}

We presented a novel mesh density adaptation method that improves the results of template-based surface reconstruction. Our method provides the control on vertex density of a mesh using a simple regularization loss based on mean edge length per vertex. The regularization is easily incorporated into existing optimization-based reconstruction tasks, such as inverse rendering and non-rigid surface registration. Our approach fills an often overlooked missing piece in the regularization, mesh density control, for accurate surface reconstruction via template deformation.
