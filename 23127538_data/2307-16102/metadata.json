  "abstract": "The present article deals with properties of one class of functions with complicated local structure. These functions can be modeled by certain operators of digits. Such operators were considered by the author earlier (for example, see [27, 39] and references therein). This research is a generalization of investigations presented in the last-mentioned papers.",
