  "abstract": "We propose a global geometric framework which allows one to encode a natural non-perturbative generalisation of usual Batalin-Vilkovisky (BV-)theory. Namely, we construct a concrete model of derived differential geometry, whose geometric objects are formal derived smooth stacks, i.e. stacks on formal derived smooth manifolds, together with a notion of differential geometry on them. This provides a working language to study generalised geometric spaces that are smooth, infinite-dimensional, higher and derived at the same time. Such a formalism is obtained by combining Schreiber's differential cohesion with the machinery of Töen-Vezzosi's homotopical algebraic geometry applied to the theory of derived manifolds of Spivak and Carchedi-Steffens. We investigate two classes of examples of non-perturbative classical BV-theories in the context of derived differential cohesion: scalar field theory and Yang-Mills theory.",
