\section{CONCLUSION}

This paper introduces \tool, one of the first on-device Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Deep Neural Network (DNN) frameworks targeting robotic applications. \tool achieves high accuracy and on-device efficiency in terms of critical performance metrics, such as latency, energy, and memory usage. Extensive experiments on three widely used embedded platforms demonstrate that \tool can provide high accuracy while enabling superior on-device efficiency, particularly when compared to state-of-the-art Single-Input Single-Output (SISO) and Multiple-Input Single-Output (MISO) models. Our research is an important first step toward building efficient MIMO DNN frameworks for practical on-device learning scenarios, particularly for robots that often face hardware and performance constraints.
