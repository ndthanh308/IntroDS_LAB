\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we analysed 92 papers to understand the current applications of computer technology in TCP. In collaboration with experts, we examined these papers from three perspectives (\ie subject, framework, and technique). On top of them, we addressed the potential research directions for utilizing computer technologies in TCP. This paper can aid with future study by serving as a useful introduction to the area of computer methods used with TCP.
