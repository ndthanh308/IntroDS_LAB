\section{Computational Techniques}
\label{sec:tech}

In this section, we will discuss computational techniques that have been applied to TCP. Although TCP and natural images are similar in their modality as pictures, they differ in terms of technique used for interpretation and creation. We organize and elaborate the techniques from three perspectives as follows: 

\textbf{tasks} for which computational techniques are used (\autoref{sec:tech_tasks}), 
\textbf{extracted features} which the models use for these tasks (\autoref{sec:tech_feature}), 
and \textbf{rendering techniques} in which the model generate new paintings (\autoref{sec:tech_renderin}).
% These categories of each aspect are listed in \autoref{fig:tech_classes}. 
These categories of each aspect are listed in \hyperref[fig:techClasses]{Fig.~5}.
