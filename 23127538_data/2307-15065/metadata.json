  "abstract": "Let $(\\acute{N},g,\\nabla )$\\ be a $2n$-dimensional quasi-statistical manifold that admits a pseudo-Riemannian metric $g$ (or $h)$ and a linear connection $\\nabla $ with torsion. This paper aims to study an almost Hermitian structure $(g,L)$ and an almost anti-Hermitian structure $(h,L)$ on a quasi-statistical manifold that admit an almost complex structure $L$. Firstly, under certain conditions, we present the integrability of the almost complex structure $L$. We show that when $d^\\nabla L =0$ and the condition of torsion-compatibility are satisfied, $(\\acute{N},g,\\nabla ,$ $L)$ turns into a Kähler manifold. Secondly, we give necessary and sufficient conditions under which $(\\acute{N},h,\\nabla ,L)$ is an anti-Kä% hler manifold, where $h$ is an anti-Hermitian metric. Moreover, we search the necessary conditions for $(\\acute{N},h,\\nabla ,L)$ to be a quasi-Kähler-Norden manifold.",
