  "abstract": "We describe the action of the shifted Yangian of sl_2 on the cohomology groups of the Quot schemes of 0-dimensional quotients on a smooth projective curve. We introduce a commuting family of r operators in the positive half of the Yangian, whose action yields a natural basis of the Quot cohomology. These commuting operators further lead to formulas for the operators of multiplication by the Segre classes of the universal bundle.",
