  "abstract": "We propose a neural image codec at reduced complexity which overfits the decoder parameters to each input image. While autoencoders perform up to a million multiplications per decoded pixel, the proposed approach only requires 2300 multiplications per pixel. Albeit low-complexity, the method rivals autoencoder performance and surpasses HEVC performance under various coding conditions. Additional lightweight modules and an improved training process provide a 14% rate reduction with respect to previous overfitted codecs, while offering a similar complexity.
