  "abstract": "The existing deepfake detection methods have reached a bottleneck in generalizing to unseen forgeries and manipulation approaches. Based on the observation that the deepfake detectors exhibit a preference for overfitting the specific primary regions in input, this paper enhances the generalization capability from a novel regularization perspective. This can be simply achieved by augmenting the images through primary region removal, thereby preventing the detector from over-relying on data bias. Our method consists of two stages, namely the static localization for primary region maps, as well as the dynamic exploitation of primary region masks. The proposed method can be seamlessly integrated into different backbones without affecting their inference efficiency. We conduct extensive experiments over three widely used deepfake datasets - DFDC, DF-1.0, and Celeb-DF with five backbones. Our method demonstrates an average performance improvement of 6% across different backbones and performs competitively with several state-of-the-art baselines.",
