  "abstract": "An initial-boundary value problem with one boundary condition is considered for the higher order nonlinear Schrödinger equation. It is assumed that either the boundary condition is homogeneous or the nonlinearity in the equation is quadratic. Results on existence, uniqueness and continuous dependence on input data of global weak solutions are obtained.",
