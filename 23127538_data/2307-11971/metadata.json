  "abstract": "In this short communication, we describe the recent debate on whether the hazard function should be used for causal inference in time-to-event studies and consider three different potential outcomes frameworks (by Rubin, Robins, and Pearl, respectively) as well as use the single-world intervention graph to show mathematically that the hazard function has causal interpretations under all three frameworks. In addition, we argue that the hazard ratio over time can provide a useful interpretation in practical settings.",
