  "abstract": "General Relativity provides us with some solutions for rotating black holes. However, there are some problems associated with them: the appearance of singularities, the possibility of violations of the cosmic censorship conjecture, the existence of regions where the mass acts repulsively and the violation of causality. Many authors consider that these problems reveal the existence of certain limits in the applicability of General Relativity. For instance, it is believed that the same existence of singularities in the classical black hole solutions is a weakness of the theory and that a full Quantum Gravity Theory would provide us with singularity-free black hole models. In this paper, the generic properties of the interiors of singularity-free rotating black holes are analyzed. Remarkably, it is shown that they are devoid of any of the aforementioned problems of the classical solutions.",
