abstract = {Over the past decade, the possibility of manipulating chemistry and material properties using hybrid light-matter states has stimulated considerable interest. Hybrid light-matter states can be generated by placing molecules in an optical cavity that is resonant with a molecular transition. Importantly, the hybridization occurs even in the dark because the coupling process involves the zero-point fluctuations of the optical mode (a.k.a. vacuum field) and the molecular transition. In other words, unlike photochemistry, no real photon is required to induce this strong coupling phenomenon. Strong coupling in general, but vibrational strong coupling (VSC) in particular, offers exciting possibilities for molecular and, more generally, material science. Not only is it a new tool to control chemical reactivity, but it also gives insight into which vibrations are involved in a reaction. This Perspective gives the underlying fundamentals of light-matter strong coupling, including a mini-tutorial on the practical issues to achieve VSC. Recent advancements in "vibro-polaritonic chemistry"and related topics are presented along with the challenges for this exciting new field.},

abstract = {One of the most exciting and debated aspects of polariton chemistry is the possibility that chemical reactions can be catalyzed by vibrational strong coupling (VSC) with confined optical modes in the absence of external illumination. Here, we report an attempt to reproduce the enhanced rate of cyanate ion hydrolysis reported by Hiura et al. [chemRxiv:7234721 (2019)] when the collective OH stretching vibrations of water (which is both the solvent and a reactant) are strongly coupled to a Fabry-P{\'{e}}rot cavity mode. Using a piezo-tunable microcavity, we reproduce the reported vacuum Rabi splitting but fail to observe any change in the reaction rate as the cavity thickness is tuned in and out of the strong coupling regime during a given experiment. These findings suggest that there are subtleties involved in successfully realizing VSC-catalyzed reaction kinetics and therefore motivate a broader effort within the community to validate the claims of polariton chemistry in the dark.},

Recent breakthroughs explain some of the observations through the Grote-Hynes theory, where the cavity introduces friction with the reaction coordinate, thus reducing the transmission coefficient and the rate. The regime of rate enhancement, the observed sharp resonances at varying cavity frequencies, and the survival of these effects in the collective regime remain mostly unexplained. In this paper, we consider the $\backslash$emph{\{}cis{\}}-$\backslash$emph{\{}trans{\}} isomerization of HONO atomistically using an $\backslash$emph{\{}ab-initio{\}} potential energy surface. We evaluate the transmission coefficient using the reactive flux method and identify the conditions for rate acceleration. In the underdamped, low-friction regime of the reaction coordinate, the cavity coupling enhances the rate with increasing coupling strength until reaching the Kramers turnover point. Sharp resonances in this regime are related to cavity-enabled energy redistribution channels.},

abstract = {The solid hydrogen compounds D2, HD and H2 remain quantum molecular solids up to pressures in the 100 GPa range. A remarkable macroscopic consequence is the existence of a pressure-induced broken symmetry phase transition, in which the molecules go from a spherical rotational state to an anisotropic rotational state. Theoretical understanding of the broken symmetry phase structure remains controversial, despite numerous studies. Some open questions concern the existence of long- or short-range orientational order; whether a strong isotopic shift on the transition pressure should be assigned to the nuclear zero-point motion or to quantum localization; and whether the structures are cubic, hexagonal or orthorhombic. Here we present experimental data on the structure of the broken symmetry phase in solid D 2, obtained by a combination of neutron and X-ray diffraction up to 60 GPa. Our data are incompatible with orthorhombic structures predicted by recent theoretical works. We find that the broken symmetry phase structure is incommensurate with local orientational order, being similar to that found in metastable cubic para-D2.},

abstract = {Hydrogen, being the first element in the periodic table, has the simplest electronic structure of any atom, and the hydrogen molecule contains the simplest covalent chemical bond. Nevertheless, the phase diagram of hydrogen is poorly understood. Determining the stable structures of solid hydrogen is a tremendous experimental challenge, because hydrogen atoms scatter X-rays only weakly, leading to low-resolution diffraction patterns. Theoretical studies encounter major difficulties owing to the small energy differences between structures and the importance of the zero-point motion of the protons. We have systematically investigated the zero-temperature phase diagram of solid hydrogen using first-principles density functional theory (DFT) electronic-structure methods, including the proton zero-point motion at the harmonic level. Our study leads to a radical revision of the DFT phase diagram of hydrogen up to nearly 400GPa. That the most stable phases remain insulating to very high pressures eliminates a major discrepancy between theory and experiment. One of our new phases is calculated to be stable over a wide range of pressures, and its vibrational properties agree with the available experimental data for phase III. {\textcopyright} 2007 Nature Publishing Group.},

abstract = {We use the diffusion quantum Monte Carlo (DMC) method to calculate the ground-state phase diagram of solid molecular hydrogen and examine the stability of the most important insulating phases relative to metallic crystalline molecular hydrogen. We account for finite-size errors by combining the use of twist-averaged boundary conditions with corrections obtained using the Kwee-Zhang-Krakauer functional in density functional theory. To study the closure of the band gap with increasing pressure, we perform quasi-particle many-body calculations using the GW method. In the static approximation, our DMC simulations indicate a transition from the insulating Cmca-12 structure to the metallic Cmca structure at around 375 GPa. The GW band gap of Cmca-12 closes at roughly the same pressure. In the dynamic DMC phase diagram, which includes the effects of zero-point energy in the quasi-harmonic approximation, the Cmca-12 structure remains stable up to 430 GPa, well above the pressure at which the GW band gap closes. Our results predict that the semimetallic state observed experimentally at around 360 GPa (2012 Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 146402) may correspond to the Cmca-12 structure near the pressure at which the band gap closes. The dynamic DMC phase diagram indicates that the hexagonal-close-packed P63/m structure, which has the largest band gap of the insulating structures considered, is stable up to 220 GPa. This is consistent with recent x-ray data taken at pressures up to 183 GPa (2010 Phys. Rev.

The formalism of light-matter interaction is different for classical and quantum fields, but some analogies remain, such as the formation of light induced crossings. We show that under particular circumstances, the molecular dynamics under quantum or classical fields produce similar results, as long as the radiation is prepared as a Fock state and far from ultra-strong coupling regimes. At this point, the choice of specific initial Fock states is irrelevant since the dynamics scales. However, in realistic multistate molecular systems, radiative scaling may fail due to the presence of simultaneous efficient non-radiative couplings in the dynamics. Polar molecules have permanent dipoles, and within the context of the full quantum Rabi model with a Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian, they play a crucial role in the polaritonic dynamics since both permanent dipole moments and self-energy terms produce drastic changes on the undressed potential energy surfaces at high coupling strengths. We also gauge the effect of including rotational degrees of freedom in cavity molecular photodynamics. For diatomic molecules, the addition of rotation amounts to transform (both with classical or quantum fields) a light induced crossing into a light induced conical intersection. However, we show that conical intersections due to molecular rotation do not represent the standard properties of well-known efficient intrinsic conical intersections inasmuch they do not enhance the quantum transition rates.},

abstract = {The light-matter interaction can be utilized to qualitatively alter physical properties of materials. Recent theoretical and experimental studies have explored this possibility of controlling matter by light based on driving many-body systems via strong classical electromagnetic radiation, leading to a time-dependent Hamiltonian for electronic or lattice degrees of freedom. To avoid inevitable heating, pump-probe setups with ultrashort laser pulses have so far been used to study transient light-induced modifications in materials. Here, we pursue yet another direction of controlling quantum matter by modifying quantum fluctuations of its electromagnetic environment. In contrast to earlier proposals on light-enhanced electron-electron interactions, we consider a dipolar quantum many-body system embedded in a cavity composed of metal mirrors and formulate a theoretical framework to manipulate its equilibrium properties on the basis of quantum light-matter interaction. We analyze hybridization of different types of the fundamental excitations, including dipolar phonons, cavity photons, and plasmons in metal mirrors, arising from the cavity confinement in the regime of strong light-matter interaction. This hybridization qualitatively alters the nature of the collective excitations and can be used to selectively control energy-level structures in a wide range of platforms. Most notably, in quantum paraelectrics, we show that the cavity-induced softening of infrared optical phonons enhances the ferroelectric phase in comparison with the bulk materials. Our findings suggest an intriguing possibility of inducing a superradiant-type transition via the light-matter coupling without external pumping. We also discuss possible applications of the cavity-induced modifications in collective excitations to molecular materials and excitonic devices.},

abstract = {Advances in nanophotonics, quantum optics, and low-dimensional materials have enabled precise control of light-matter interactions down to the nanoscale. Combining concepts from each of these fields, there is now an opportunity to create and manipulate photonic matter via strong coupling of molecules to the electromagnetic field. Toward this goal, here we demonstrate a first principles framework to calculate polaritonic excited-state potential-energy surfaces, transition dipole moments, and transition densities for strongly coupled light-matter systems. In particular, we demonstrate the applicability of our methodology by calculating the polaritonic excited-state manifold of a formaldehyde molecule strongly coupled to an optical cavity. This proof-of-concept calculation shows how strong coupling can be exploited to alter photochemical reaction pathways by influencing avoided crossings with tuning of the cavity frequency and coupling strength. Therefore, by introducing an ab initio method to calculate excited-state potential-energy surfaces, our work opens a new avenue for the field of polaritonic chemistry.},

abstract = {Experiments at the interface of quantum optics and chemistry have revealed that strong coupling between light and matter can substantially modify the chemical and physical properties of molecules and solids. While the theoretical description of such situations is usually based on nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics, which contains quadratic light-matter coupling terms, it is commonplace to disregard these terms and restrict the treatment to purely bilinear couplings. In this work, we clarify the physical origin and the substantial impact of the most common quadratic terms, the diamagnetic and self-polarization terms, and highlight why neglecting them can lead to rather unphysical results. Specifically, we demonstrate their relevance by showing that neglecting these terms leads to the loss of gauge invariance, basis set dependence, disintegration (loss of bound states) of any system in the basis set limit, unphysical radiation of the ground state, and an artificial dependence on the static dipole. Besides providing important guidance for modeling of strongly coupled light-matter systems, the presented results also indicate conditions under which those effects might become accessible.},

abstract = {We present a new theoretical framework, polarized Fock states (PFSs), to describe the coupled molecule-cavity hybrid system in quantum electrodynamics. Through the quantum light-matter interactions under the dipole Gauge, the molecular permanent dipoles polarize the photon field by displacing the photonic coordinate. Hence, it is convenient to use these shifted Fock states (termed the PFSs) to describe light-matter interactions under the strong coupling regimes. These PFSs are nonorthogonal to each other and are light-matter entangled states. They allow an intuitive understanding of several phenomena that go beyond the prediction of the quantum Rabi model, while also offering numerical convenience to converge the results with much fewer states. With this powerful new theoretical framework, we explain how molecular permanent dipoles lead to the generation of multiple photons from a single electronic excitation (down-conversion), effectively achieving the dynamical Casimir effect through the nuclear vibration instead of cavity mirror oscillations.},

Highly anisotropic materials often display nonintuitive optical properties and can permit propagation of subdiffractional waveguide modes, with hyperbolic dispersion, throughout their bulk. Here, we report on the observation of optically induced electronic hyperbolicity in the layered transition metal dichalcogenide tungsten diselenide (WSe2). We used photoexcitation to inject electron-hole pairs in WSe2and then visualized, by transient nanoimaging, the hyperbolic rays that traveled along conical trajectories inside of the crystal. We establish here the signatures of programmable hyperbolic electrodynamics and assess the role of quantum transitions of excitons within the Rydberg series in the observed polaritonic response.},

abstract = {Dynamic high pressure is 1 GPa (10 kbar) or greater with a rise time and a duration ranging from 1 ps (10-12 s) to 1 $\nu$s (10-6 s). Today it is possible in a laboratory to achieve pressures dynamically up to ∼500 GPa (5 Mbar) and greater, compressions as much as ∼15-fold greater than initial density in the case of hydrogen and temperatures from ∼0.1 up to several electronvolts (11 600 K). At these conditions materials are extremely condensed semiconductors or degenerate metals. Temperature can be tuned independently of pressure by a combination of shock and isentropic compression. As a result, new opportunities are now available in condensed matter physics at extreme conditions. The basic physics of the dynamic process, experimental methods of generating and diagnosing matter at these extreme conditions and a technique to recover metastable materials intact from ∼100 GPa shock pressures are discussed. Results include (i) generation of pressure standards at static pressures up to ∼200 GPa (2 Mbar) at 300 K, (ii) single-shock compression of small-molecular fluids, including resolution of the recent controversy over the correct shock-compression curve of liquid D 2 at 100 GPa pressures, (iii) the first observations of metallization of fluid hydrogen, nitrogen and oxygen compressed quasi-isentropically at 100 GPa pressures, (iv) implications for the interiors of giant planets within our solar system, extrasolar giant planets and brown dwarfs discovered recently and the equation of state of deuterium-tritium in inertial confinement fusion (ICF) and (v) prospects of recovering novel materials from extreme conditions, such as metastable solid metallic hydrogen.

We demonstrate how an expansion in terms of conditional electronic and photon-nuclear wave functions accurately describes eigenstates of strongly correlated light-matter systems. For a GaAs quantum ring model in resonance with a photon mode we highlight how the ground-state electronic potential-energy surface changes the usual harmonic potential of the free photon mode to a dressed mode with a double-well structure. This change is accompanied by a splitting of the electronic ground-state density. For a model where the photon mode is in resonance with a vibrational transition, we observe in the excited-state electronic potential-energy surface a splitting from a single minimum to a double minimum. Furthermore, for a time-dependent setup, we show how the dynamics in correlated light-matter systems can be understood in terms of population transfer between potential energy surfaces.

Hinzu tritt als dritter Bestandteil der Wechselwirkung die kurzperiodische gegenseitige St{\"{o}}rung der inneren Elektronenbewegung der Molek{\"{u}}le, welcher Beitrag bei den ein-fachsten nichtpolaren und auch noch bei schwach polaren Molek{\"{u}}len den Haupt-bestandteil der Molekularattraktion darstellt. Er macht insbesondere die fr{\"{u}}her unvermeidliche Annahme einer Quadrupolstruktur der Edelgase entbehrlich. Die rein theoretische Bestimmung der Molekularkr{\"{a}}fte, welche als St{\"{o}}rungs-effekte zweiter Ordnung zu behandeln sind, ist naturgem{\"{a}}{\ss} kaum auszuf{\"{u}}hren; dagegen lassen sich die Kr{\"{a}}fte auf Grund ihres theoretischen Zusammenhanges mit denf-Werten der Dispersionsformel aus optischen Messungen absch{\"{a}}tzen. Die so abgesch{\"{a}}tzten Kr{\"{a}}fte ergeben mit derjenigen Genauigkeit, mit der sie selbst sichergestellt sind, das van der Waalssche Attraktionsglied der empirischen Zustandsgieichung.},

abstract = {The theory of intermolecular forces has advanced very greatly in the last few decades. Simple empirical models are no longer adequate to account for the detailed and accurate experimental measurements that are now available, or to predict properties such as the structures of molecular crystals reliably. At the same time computational methods for calculating intermolecular forces have improved enormously, so that it is possible to construct much more accurate intermolecular potential energy functions for much larger systems than was possible twenty years ago. The Theory of Intermolecular Forces describes these advances. It sets out the mathematical techniques that are needed to describe molecular properties and the ways that they contribute to the interactions between molecules. There is a detailed account of the use of multipole moments to describe electrostatic and related interactions, and both Cartesian and spherical tensor methods are described. Perturbation theories of intermolecular interactions, in particular the widely-used SAPT and SAPT-DFT methods, are discussed in detail. The many analytic models of intermolecular potentials are described and discussed, and the methods used to predict experimental properties from them are described.},

Such hybrid states can be generated by simply placing a material in the spatially confined electromagnetic field of an optical resonator, such as that provided by two parallel mirrors. This occurs even in the dark because it is electromagnetic fluctuations of the cavity (the vacuum field) that strongly couple with the material. Experimental and theoretical studies have shown that the mere presence of these hybrid states can enhance properties such as transport, magnetism, and superconductivity and modify (bio)chemical reactivity. This emerging field is highly multidisciplinary, and much of its potential has yet to be explored.},

In this work, we investigate how strong light-matter coupling inside an optical cavity can modify these intermolecular forces. We perform a detailed comparison between currently available ab initio electron-photon methodologies. The electromagnetic field inside the cavity can modulate the ground state properties of weakly bound complexes. Controlling the field polarization, the interactions can be stabilized or destabilized, and electron densities, dipole moments, and polarizabilities can be altered. We demonstrate that electron-photon correlation is fundamental to describe intermolecular interactions in strong light-matter coupling. This work proposes optical cavities as a novel tool to manipulate and control ground state properties, solvent effects, and intermolecular interactions for molecules and materials.},

abstract = {Experiments at the interface of quantum optics and chemistry have revealed that strong coupling between light and matter can substantially modify the chemical and physical properties of molecules and solids. While the theoretical description of such situations is usually based on nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics, which contains quadratic light-matter coupling terms, it is commonplace to disregard these terms and restrict the treatment to purely bilinear couplings. In this work, we clarify the physical origin and the substantial impact of the most common quadratic terms, the diamagnetic and self-polarization terms, and highlight why neglecting them can lead to rather unphysical results. Specifically, we demonstrate their relevance by showing that neglecting these terms leads to the loss of gauge invariance, basis set dependence, disintegration (loss of bound states) of any system in the basis set limit, unphysical radiation of the ground state, and an artificial dependence on the static dipole. Besides providing important guidance for modeling of strongly coupled light-matter systems, the presented results also indicate conditions under which those effects might become accessible.},

abstract = {In this work, we give a comprehensive derivation of an exact and numerically feasible method to perform ab initio calculations of quantum particles interacting with a quantized electromagnetic field. We present a hierarchy of density-functional-type theories that describe the interaction of charged particles with photons and introduce the appropriate Kohn-Sham schemes. We show how the evolution of a system described by quantum electrodynamics in Coulomb gauge is uniquely determined by its initial state and two reduced quantities. These two fundamental observables, the polarization of the Dirac field and the vector potential of the photon field, can be calculated by solving two coupled, nonlinear evolution equations without the need to explicitly determine the (numerically infeasible) many-body wave function of the coupled quantum system. To find reliable approximations to the implicit functionals, we present the appropriate Kohn-Sham construction. In the nonrelativistic limit, this density-functional-type theory of quantum electrodynamics reduces to the density-functional reformulation of the Pauli-Fierz Hamiltonian, which is based on the current density of the electrons and the vector potential of the photon field. By making further approximations, e.g., restricting the allowed modes of the photon field, we derive further density-functional-type theories of coupled matter-photon systems for the corresponding approximate Hamiltonians. In the limit of only two sites and one mode we deduce the appropriate effective theory for the two-site Hubbard model coupled to one photonic mode. This model system is used to illustrate the basic ideas of a density-functional reformulation in great detail and we present the exact Kohn-Sham potentials for our coupled matter-photon model system. {\textcopyright} 2014 American Physical Society.},

We identify fundamental changes in Born-Oppenheimer surfaces, spectroscopic quantities, conical intersections, and efficiency for quantum control.We conclude by applying our recently developed quantum-electrodynamical density-functional theory to spontaneous emission and show how a straightforward approximation accurately describes the correlated electron-photon dynamics.

abstract = {By applying the Born-Huang expansion, originally developed for coupled nucleus-electron systems, to the full nucleus-electron-photon Hamiltonian of nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the long-wavelength approximation, we deduce an exact set of coupled equations for electrons on photonic energy surfaces and the nuclei on the resulting polaritonic energy surfaces. This theory describes seamlessly many-body interactions among nuclei, electrons, and photons including the quantum fluctuation of the electromagnetic field and provides a proper first-principle framework to describe QED-chemistry phenomena, namely polaritonic and cavity chemistry effects. Since the photonic surfaces and the corresponding nonadiabatic coupling elements can be solved analytically, the resulting expansion can be brought into a compact form, which allows us to analyze aspects of coupled nucleus-electron-photon systems in a simple and intuitive manner. Furthermore, we discuss structural differences between the exact quantum treatment and Floquet theory, show how existing implementations of Floquet theory can be adjusted to adhere to QED, and highlight how standard drawbacks of Floquet theory can be overcome. We then highlight, by assuming that the relevant photonic frequencies of a prototypical cavity QED experiment are in the energy range of the electrons, how from this generalized Born-Huang expansion an adapted Born-Oppenheimer approximation for nuclei on polaritonic surfaces can be deduced. This form allows a direct application of first-principle methods of quantum chemistry such as coupled-cluster or configuration interaction approaches to QED chemistry. By restricting the basis set of this generalized Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we furthermore bridge quantum chemistry and quantum optics by recovering simple models of coupled matter-photon systems employed in quantum optics and polaritonic chemistry. We finally highlight numerically that simple few-level models can lead to physically wrong predictions, even in weak-coupling regimes, and show how the presented derivations from first principles help to check and derive physically reliable simplified models.},

The control of light and heat at thermodynamic limits enables exciting new opportunities for the rapidly converging fields of polaritonic chemistry and quantum optics at the atomic scale from a theoretical and computational perspective. Our review follows remarkable experimental demonstrations that now routinely achieve the strong coupling limit of light and matter. In polaritonic chemistry, many molecules couple collectively to a single-photon mode, whereas, in the field of nanoplasmonics, strong coupling can be achieved at the single-molecule limit. Theoretical approaches to address these experiments, however, are more recent and come from a spectrum of fields merging new developments in quantum chemistry and quantum electrodynamics alike. We review these latest developments and highlight the common features between these two different limits, maintaining a focus on the theoretical tools used to analyze these two classes of systems. Finally, we present a new perspective on the need for and steps toward merging, formally and computationally, two of the most prominent and Nobel Prize-winning theories in physics and chemistry: Quantum electrodynamics and electronic structure (density functional) theory. We present a case for how a fully quantum description of light and matter that treats electrons, photons, and phonons on the same quantized footing will unravel new quantum effects in cavity-controlled chemical dynamics, optomechanics, nanophotonics, and the many other fields that use electrons, photons, and phonons.},

abstract = {The ability to achieve ultrastrong coupling between light and matter promises to bring about new means to control material properties, new concepts for manipulating light at the atomic scale, and new insights into quantum electrodynamics (QED). Thus, there is a need to develop quantitative theories of QED phenomena in complex electronic and photonic systems. In this Letter, we develop a variational theory of general non-relativistic QED systems of coupled light and matter. Essential to our Ansatz is the notion of an effective photonic vacuum whose modes are different than the modes in the absence of light-matter coupling. This variational formulation leads to a set of general equations that can describe the ground state of multielectron systems coupled to many photonic modes in real space. As a first step toward a new ab initio approach to ground and excited state energies in QED, we apply our Ansatz to describe a multilevel emitter coupled to many optical modes, a system with no analytical solution. We find a compact semianalytical formula which describes ground and excited state energies very well in all regimes of coupling parameters allowed by sum rules. Our formulation provides a nonperturbative theory of Lamb shifts and Casimir-Polder forces, as well as suggest new physical concepts such as the Casimir energy of a single atom in a cavity. Our method thus give rise to highly accurate nonperturbative descriptions of many other phenomena in general QED systems.},

abstract = {We model a collection of N two-level systems (TLSs) coupled to a multimode cavity via Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss (MMST) dynamics, sampling both electronic and photonic zero-point energies (ZPEs) and propagating independent trajectories in Wigner phase space. By investigating the ground-state stability of a single TLS, we use MMST dynamics to separately study both electronic ZPE effects (which would naively lead to the breakdown of the electronic ground state) and photonic ZPE effects (which would naively lead to spontaneous absorption). By contrast, including both effects, i.e., sampling both electronic and photonic ZPEs, leads to the dynamical stability of the electronic ground state. Therefore, MMST dynamics provides a practical way to identify the contributions of self-interaction and vacuum fluctuations. More importantly, we find that MMST dynamics can predict accurate quantum dynamics for both electronic populations and electromagnetic field intensity in the high saturation limit. For a single TLS in a cavity, MMST dynamics correctly predicts the initial exponential decay of spontaneous emission, Poincar{\'{e}} recurrences, and the positional dependence of a spontaneous emission rate. For an array of N equally spaced TLSs with only one TLS excited initially, MMST dynamics correctly predicts the modification of spontaneous emission rate as a function of the spacing between TLSs. Finally, MMST dynamics also correctly models Dicke's superradiance and subradiance, i.e., the dynamics when all TLSs are excited initially, including the correct quantum statistics for the delay time (as found by counting trajectories, for which a full quantum simulation is hard to achieve). Therefore, this work raises the possibility of simulating large-scale collective light-matter interactions with methods beyond mean-field theory.},

In this work, we investigate the proton transfer reactions in the prototype malonaldehyde and Z-3-amino-propenal (aminopropenal) molecules using different quantum electrodynamics methods, in particular, quantum electrodynamics coupled cluster theory and quantum electrodynamical density functional theory.

Pioneering works in this direction have shown the effects of this regime in the excited state reactivity of molecular systems and at the same time have opened up the question of whether it is possible to introduce any modifications in the electronic ground energy landscape which could affect chemical thermodynamics and/or kinetics. In this work, we use a model system of many molecules coupled to a surface-plasmon field to gain insight on the key parameters which govern the modifications of the ground-state potential energy surface. Our findings confirm that the energetic changes per molecule are determined by effects that are essentially on the order of single-molecule light-matter couplings, in contrast with those of the electronically excited states, for which energetic corrections are of a collective nature. Hence the prospects of ultrastrong coupling to change ground-state chemical reactions for the parameters studied in this model are limited. Still, we reveal some intriguing quantum-coherent effects associated with pathways of concerted reactions, where two or more molecules undergo reactions simultaneously and which can be of relevance in low-barrier reactions. Finally, we also explore modifications to nonadiabatic dynamics and conclude that, for our particular model, the presence of a large number of dark states yields negligible effects. Our study reveals new possibilities as well as limitations for the emerging field of polariton chemistry.},

Our theoretical results suggest that the VSC kinetics modification is originated from the non-Markovian dynamics of the cavity radiation mode that couples to the molecule, leading to the dynamical caging effect of the reaction coordinate and the suppression of reaction rate constant for a specific range of photon frequency close to the barrier frequency. We use a simple analytical non-Markovian rate theory to describe a single molecular system coupled to a cavity mode. We demonstrate the accuracy of the rate theory by performing direct numerical calculations of the transmission coefficients with the same model of the molecule-cavity hybrid system.

Using quantum transition state theory (TST), we examine the coherent nature of adiabatic reactions in cavities and derive the cavity-induced changes in eigenfrequencies, zero-point energy, and quantum tunneling. The resulting quantum TST calculation allows us to explain and predict the resonance effect (i.e., maximal kinetic modification via tuning the cavity frequency), collective effect (i.e., linear scaling with the molecular density), and selectivity (i.e., cavity-induced control of the branching ratio).

While in wavelength-scale optical cavities the light-matter interaction is ruled by collective effects, plasmonic subwavelength nanocavities allow even single molecules to reach strong coupling. Due to these very distinct situations, a multiscale theoretical toolbox is then required to explore the rich phenomenology of polaritonic chemistry. Within this framework, each component of the system (molecules and electromagnetic modes) needs to be treated in sufficient detail to obtain reliable results. Starting from the very general aspects of light-molecule interactions in typical experimental setups, we underline the basic concepts that should be taken into account when operating in this new area of research. Building on these considerations, we then provide a map of the theoretical tools already available to tackle chemical applications of molecular polaritons at different scales.

Experiment alone cannot establish the atomic structure of solid hydrogen at high pressure, because hydrogen scatters X-rays only weakly. Instead, our understanding of the atomic structure is largely based on density functional theory (DFT). By comparing Raman spectra for low-energy structures found in DFT searches with experimental spectra, candidate atomic structures have been identified for each experimentally observed phase. Unfortunately, DFT predicts a metallic structure to be energetically favoured at a broad range of pressures up to 400 GPa, where it is known experimentally that hydrogen is non-metallic. Here we show that more advanced theoretical methods (diffusion quantum Monte Carlo calculations) find the metallic structure to be uncompetitive, and predict a phase diagram in reasonable agreement with experiment.

abstract = {When photoactive molecules interact strongly with confined light modes as found in plasmonic structures or optical cavities, new hybrid light-matter states can form, the so-called polaritons. These polaritons are coherent superpositions (in the quantum mechanical sense) of excitations of the molecules and of the cavity photon or surface plasmon. Recent experimental and theoretical works suggest that access to these polaritons in cavities could provide a totally new and attractive paradigm for controlling chemical reactions that falls in between traditional chemical catalysis and coherent laser control. However, designing cavity parameters to control chemistry requires a theoretical model with which the effect of the light-matter coupling on the molecular dynamics can be predicted accurately. Here we present a multiscale quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) molecular dynamics simulation model for photoactive molecules that are strongly coupled to confined light in optical cavities or surface plasmons. Using this model we have performed simulations with up to 1600 Rhodamine molecules in a cavity. The results of these simulations reveal that the contributions of the molecules to the polariton are time-dependent due to thermal fluctuations that break symmetry. Furthermore, the simulations suggest that in addition to the cavity quality factor, also the Stokes shift and number of molecules control the lifetime of the polariton. Because large numbers of molecules interacting with confined light can now be simulated in atomic detail, we anticipate that our method will lead to a better understanding of the effects of strong coupling on chemical reactivity. Ultimately the method may even be used to systematically design cavities to control photochemistry.},

abstract = {Information on the behavior of hydrogen-containing simple molecular systems at high pressures and temperatures is central to many problems in chemistry and allied sciences. The combination of increasing pressure and temperature causes a redistribution of the electronic density, and the resulting alterations in interatomic interactions give rise to changes in macroscopic properties. Experimental studies of hydrogen-rich systems under extreme conditions have advanced considerably in recent years as a result of improvements in diamond anvil cell technology in combination with resistive- and laser-heating techniques. These experimental methods are combined with spectroscopic and diffraction techniques, and the results interpreted with the aid of molecular simulations. In this tutorial review we discuss recent findings in hydrogen, water, and other selected hydrogen-rich systems including compounds formed from these materials. The results are examined in terms of the evolution of effective potentials and interatomic vibrational coupling, molecular dissociation and recombination, ionization and polymerization, quantum effects, and order-disorder phenomena. {\textcopyright} 2006 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

@article{Li2020b,
abstract = {Recent experiments suggest that vibrational strong coupling (VSC) may significantly modify ground-state chemical reactions and their rates even without external pumping. The intrinsic mechanism of this "vacuum-field catalysis"remains largely unclear. Generally, modifications of thermal reactions in the ground electronic states can be caused by equilibrium or non-equilibrium effects. The former are associated with modifications of the reactant equilibrium distribution as expressed by the transition state theory of chemical reaction rates, while the latter stem from the dynamics of reaching and leaving transition state configurations. Here, we examine how VSC can affect chemical reactions rates in a cavity environment according to transition state theory. Our approach is to examine the effect of coupling to cavity mode(s) on the potential of mean force (PMF) associated with the reaction coordinate. Within the context of classical nuclei and classical photons and also assuming no charge overlap between molecules, we find that while the PMF can be affected by the cavity environment, this effect is negligible for the usual micron-length cavities used to examine VSC situations.},

When a reaction coordinate is strongly coupled to the solvent molecules, the reaction rate constant is reduced due to the dynamical caging effect. We demonstrate that collectively coupling the solvent to the cavity can further enhance this dynamical caging effect, leading to additional suppression of the chemical kinetics.

abstract = {Recent developments in path integral methodology have significantly reduced the computational expense of including quantum mechanical effects in the nuclear motion in ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. However, the implementation of these developments requires a considerable programming effort, which has hindered their adoption. Here we describe i-PI, an interface written in Python that has been designed to minimise the effort required to bring state-of-the-art path integral techniques to an electronic structure program. While it is best suited to first principles calculations and path integral molecular dynamics, i-PI can also be used to perform classical molecular dynamics simulations, and can just as easily be interfaced with an empirical forcefield code. To give just one example of the many potential applications of the interface, we use it in conjunction with the CP2K electronic structure package to showcase the importance of nuclear quantum effects in high-pressure water.

Ireland Licensing provisions: GNU General Public License, version 3 No. of lines in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 138626 No. of bytes in distributed program, including test data, etc.: 3128618 Distribution format: tar.gz Programming language: Python. Computer: Multiple architectures. Operating system: Linux, Mac OSX, Windows. RAM: Less than 256 Mb Classification: 7.7. External routines: NumPy Nature of problem: Bringing the latest developments in the modelling of nuclear quantum effects with path integral molecular dynamics to ab initio electronic structure programs with minimal implementational effort. Solution method: State-of-the-art path integral molecular dynamics techniques are implemented in a Python interface. Any electronic structure code can be patched to receive the atomic coordinates from the Python interface, and to return the forces and energy that are used to integrate the equations of motion. Restrictions: This code only deals with distinguishable particles. It does not include fermonic or bosonic exchanges between equivalent nuclei, which can become important at very low temperatures. Running time: Depends dramatically on the nature of the simulation being performed. A few minutes for short tests with empirical force fields, up to several weeks for production calculations with ab initio forces. The examples provided with the code run in less than an hour.}

    abstract = "{We address the question of the applicability of the argument theorem (of complex variable theory) to the calculation of two distinct energies: (i) the first-order dispersion interaction energy of two separated oscillators, when one of the oscillators is excited initially and (ii) the Casimir-Polder interaction of a ground-state quantum oscillator near a perfectly conducting plane. We show that the argument theorem can be used to obtain the generally accepted equation for the first-order dispersion interaction energy, which is oscillatory and varies as the inverse power of the separation r of the oscillators for separations much greater than an optical wavelength. However, for such separations, the interaction energy cannot be transformed into an integral over the positive imaginary axis. If the argument theorem is used incorrectly to relate the interaction energy to an integral over the positive imaginary axis, the interaction energy is non-oscillatory and varies as r−4, a result found by several authors. Rather remarkably, this incorrect expression for the dispersion energy actually corresponds to the nonperturbative Casimir-Polder energy for a ground-state quantum oscillator near a perfectly conducting wall, as we show using the so-called “remarkable formula” for the free energy of an oscillator coupled to a heat bath [G. W. Ford, J. T. Lewis, and R. F. O’Connell, Phys. Rev. Lett. 55, 2273 (1985)]. A derivation of that formula from basic results of statistical mechanics and the independent oscillator model of a heat bath is presented.}",
