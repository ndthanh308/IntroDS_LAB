  "abstract": "With new calibration data, thermal emission from the jet of radio galaxy M87 is studied with about 700 ks archival data with Chandra. For nucleus, HST-1, knot D, X-ray energy spectra is well fitted with a power law. However, For knot A, a power law model is rejected with a high significance and an X-ray energy spectra is well fitted with a combination model of a power law and an apec model of 0.2 keV and a metal abundance 0.00. Thermal emission from knot A is confirmed.",
