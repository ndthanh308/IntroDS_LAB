\section{Additional Details from Section \ref{sec:experiments}} \label{app:experiments}




We present additional experiments similar to the results in \cref{sec:experiments}, but using the $L^2$ metric instead of $H^1$.
In \cref{fig:mode_ablation_l2}, we plot an ablation study on the number of frequency modes for Darcy flow, similar to \cref{fig:mode_ablation}, but with $L^2$ loss. We see that the overall trends are similar, but test $L^2$ loss is noisier than test L1 loss; this makes sense, because the training loss is $H^1$.
%
In \cref{fig:full_results_l2}, we plot the performance-vs-time and Pareto frontier plots for Navier Stokes and Darcy flow, similar to \cref{fig:full_results}, but with $L^2$ loss. 
As before, we see largely the same trends as with $H^1$ loss, but the results are noisier.
%
In \cref{tab:full-8layer}, we plot the final performance from the models run in \cref{fig:full_results}.
