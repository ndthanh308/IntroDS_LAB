\section*{Broader Societal Impact}

We do not foresee any strongly negative impacts, in terms of the broader societal impacts.
In fact, this work may help to reduce the carbon footprint of scientific computing experiments.

Recently, the overall daily amount of computation used for machine learning has been increasing exponentially \citep{schwartz2020green}.
Relatedly, model sizes are also increasing fast \citep{openai2018ai}.
Leveraging the power of mixed-precision computing for neural operators can make it possible to design better models for important tasks such as climate modeling \citep{pathak2022fourcastnet} and carbon storage \citep{wen2022accelerating}.
