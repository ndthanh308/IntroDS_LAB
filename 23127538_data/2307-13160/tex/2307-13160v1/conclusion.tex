In this work, we considered the formal analysis of normalized posterior distribution in Bayesian probabilistic programming. Our contribution is a novel template-based approach that circumvents the 
the path explosion problem from loop/recursion unrolling and addresses score-recursive programs via a novel variant of Optional Stopping Theorem. 
A future direction would be to investigate whether our approach can be further improved by piecewise polynomials.
