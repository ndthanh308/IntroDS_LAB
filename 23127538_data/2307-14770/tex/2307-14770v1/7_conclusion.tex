%In this paper, we introduce the first 3D-aware full-head portrait generator, referred to as 3DPortraitGAN, which can learn canonical 3D avatar distribution images from a collection of single-view real portraits with diverse body pose. 
We presented 3DPortraitGAN, the first 3D-aware full-head portrait generator that can learn canonical 3D avatar distribution images from a collection of single-view real portraits with diverse body poses, in this paper. 
%Initially, We build the first high-quality, large-scale, and single-view real portrait dataset with diverse camera parameters and body poses.
%Following that, our key idea is to employ a mesh-guided deformation module that, from the desired camera views, generates portrait images with specific body poses. This helps our generator to learn a canonical 3D portrait distribution while precisely considering body pose.
%Furthermore, we introduce two pose predictors into our framework, where one controls the generator's learning of the body pose distribution, while the other helps the discriminator predict accurate body poses from input images. We consider our work an exciting advancement toward multi-view portrait generation, and we hope it will inspire further research in the future.
We started by developing the first high-quality, large-scale, single-view real portrait dataset with a wide range of camera parameters and body poses.
Then, based on the desired camera views, we used a mesh-guided deformation module to generate portrait images with specific body poses. This enables our generator to learn a canonical 3D portrait distribution while accounting for body pose.
In addition, we incorporate two pose predictors into our framework, one of which controls the generator's learning of the body pose distribution and the other which assists the discriminator in predicting accurate body poses from input images. We see our work as an exciting step forward in multi-view portrait generation, and we hope it will inspire future research.
