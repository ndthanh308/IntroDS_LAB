\looseness -1 We introduced a novel framework, \emph{submodular \RL} for decision-making under submodular rewards.
We prove the first-of-its-kind inapproximability result for \subrl i.e., the problem is not just \NP-Hard but intractable even to approximate up to any constant factor. We propose an algorithm, \subPO for this problem and show that under simplified assumptions, it achieves constant-factor approximation guarantees. 
We show that the algorithm exhibits strong empirical performance and scales very well to high-dimensional spaces. 
We hope this work will expand the reach of the \RL community to embrace the broad class of submodular objectives which are relevant to many practical real-world problems.
