	using examples and representation theory as motivation. The
	text is divided into two parts. The first covers Lie groups

	theory of semisimple Lie groups and Lie algebras, beginning
	with a detailed analysis of the representations of SU(3).
	The author illustrates the general theory with numerous
	images pertaining to Lie algebras of rank two and rank
	three, including images of root systems, lattices of

	abstract = { Legged robots require knowledge of pose and velocity in order to maintain stability and execute walking paths. Current solutions either rely on vision data, which is susceptible to environmental and lighting conditions, or fusion of kinematic and contact data with measurements from an inertial measurement unit (IMU). In this work, we develop a contact-aided invariant extended Kalman filter (InEKF) using the theory of Lie groups and invariant observer design. This filter combines contact-inertial dynamics with forward kinematic corrections to estimate pose and velocity along with all current contact points. We show that the error dynamics follows a log-linear autonomous differential equation with several important consequences: (a) the observable state variables can be rendered convergent with a domain of attraction that is independent of the system’s trajectory; (b) unlike the standard EKF, neither the linearized error dynamics nor the linearized observation model depend on the current state estimate, which (c) leads to improved convergence properties and (d) a local observability matrix that is consistent with the underlying nonlinear system. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to include IMU biases, add/remove contacts, and formulate both world-centric and robo-centric versions. We compare the convergence of the proposed InEKF with the commonly used quaternion-based extended Kalman filter (EKF) through both simulations and experiments on a Cassie-series bipedal robot. Filter accuracy is analyzed using motion capture, while a LiDAR mapping experiment provides a practical use case. Overall, the developed contact-aided InEKF provides better performance in comparison with the quaternion-based EKF as a result of exploiting symmetries present in system. }

	abstract = { Combining visual and inertial measurements has become popular in mobile robotics, since the two sensing modalities offer complementary characteristics that make them the ideal choice for accurate visual–inertial odometry or simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). While historically the problem has been addressed with filtering, advancements in visual estimation suggest that nonlinear optimization offers superior accuracy, while still tractable in complexity thanks to the sparsity of the underlying problem. Taking inspiration from these findings, we formulate a rigorously probabilistic cost function that combines reprojection errors of landmarks and inertial terms. The problem is kept tractable and thus ensuring real-time operation by limiting the optimization to a bounded window of keyframes through marginalization. Keyframes may be spaced in time by arbitrary intervals, while still related by linearized inertial terms. We present evaluation results on complementary datasets recorded with our custom-built stereo visual–inertial hardware that accurately synchronizes accelerometer and gyroscope measurements with imagery. A comparison of both a stereo and monocular version of our algorithm with and without online extrinsics estimation is shown with respect to ground truth. Furthermore, we compare the performance to an implementation of a state-of-the-art stochastic cloning sliding-window filter. This competitive reference implementation performs tightly coupled filtering-based visual–inertial odometry. While our approach declaredly demands more computation, we show its superior performance in terms of accuracy. }

	abstract = {We describe a method of approximation of strong solutions to Stratonovich differential equations, that depends only on the Brownian motion defining the equation. h being the step size, it is known that the order of convergence of such approximations is h in the general case, and of h in some particular cases (one-dimensional Brownian for example). Among the approximation methods with optimal order of convergence, some are asymptotically efficient in the sense that they minimize the leading coefficient in the expansion of the quadratic error. We prove that the proposed method, which is based on the representation of diffusions as flows of an ordinary differential equation, is asymptotically efficient.}
