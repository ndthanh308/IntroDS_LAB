\subsection{CSTR}\label{sec:models:components:cstr}
Any part of the gastrointestinal tract where transport phenomena (i.e., advection and diffusion) are negligible can be represented as a CSTR. The mass balance for a CSTR is
%
\begin{equation}
    V \dot c = (c_{in} - c) F + R V,
\end{equation}
%
where $V$ is volume, $c$ is concentration, $c_{in}$ is the inflow concentration, $F$ is the volumetric in- and outflow rate, and $R$ is the production rate. The volume is assumed to be constant, and the model can be reformulated as an ODE:
%
\begin{equation}
    \dot c = (c_{in} - c) F/V + R.
\end{equation}
