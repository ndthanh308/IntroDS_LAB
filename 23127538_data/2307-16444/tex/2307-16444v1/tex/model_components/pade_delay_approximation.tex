\subsubsection{Pad{\'{e}} approximation}
The Pad{\'{e}} approximation~\citep{Wei:Hu:Dai:Wang:2016} is another classical way used to approximate time delays. The first-order Pad{\'{e}} approximation of $G(s) = e^{-\tau_d s}$ is
%
\begin{align}
\label{eq:Laplace:FirstOrderPadeApproximation}
    G(s) &\approx \frac{-(\tau_d/2)s +1}{(\tau_d/2) s + 1} = \frac{- s + 2/\tau_d}{s+2/\tau_d} = \frac{P(s)}{Q(s)} = \tilde{G}(s).
\end{align}
%
The first-order Pad{\'{e}} approximation~\eqref{eq:Laplace:FirstOrderPadeApproximation} may be used to approximately realize~\eqref{eq:Laplace:TimeDelayModelYU} as the linear state space model~\eqref{eq:linear:state:space:model}, in observable canonical form, with the system matrices
%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    A_c &= -2/\tau_d, & B_c &= 4/\tau_d, \\
    C_c &= 1, & D_c &= -1.
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

The Pad{\'{e}} approximation of $G_i$ in~\eqref{eq:Laplace:TimeDelayModelYU:Multiple} is
% The approximation is more accurate for small time delays than for large time delays. In case of larger time delays, $\tau_d$, it may approximated by $M$ first order Pad{\'{e}} approximations in series, each with the time constant $\tau_d/M$:
%
\begin{align}
    G_i(s)
    &\approx \frac{-(\tau_d/(2M))s +1}{(\tau_d/(2M)) s + 1} = \frac{-s + 2M/\tau_d}{s + 2M/\tau_d} \nonumber \\
    &= \frac{P_i(s)}{Q_i(s)} = \tilde{G}_i(s),
\end{align}
%
and the system matrices in the corresponding state space realization (in observer canonical form) are
%
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
    A_{c, ij} &=
    \begin{cases}
        -2M/\tau_d, & i = j, \\
         (-1)^{i+j+1}4M/\tau_d, & i > j, \\
         0, & \text{otherwise},
    \end{cases} \\
    %
    B_{c, i} &= (-1)^{i+1} 4M/\tau_d, \\
    %
    C_{c, i} &= (-1)^{M+i}, \\
    %
    D_c &= (-1)^M,
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
%
for $i = 1, \ldots, M$ and $j = 1, \ldots, M$.
