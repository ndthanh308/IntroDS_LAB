\subsubsection{Algebraic delay approximation}\label{sec:models:components:delay:algebraic}
For completeness, we also describe an algebraic delay approximation which is used in the literature, e.g., by~\citet{Alskar:etal:2016}. However, unlike the previous approximations, it is an algebraic expression rather than a linear state space model in the form~\eqref{eq:linear:state:space:model}. Furthermore, it specifically approximates a step in the input function, $u$, whereas the other approximations can be used for arbitrary input functions.

Let $t_s$ denote the time at which the step in $u$ occurs, i.e., $u(t) = 1$ for $t \geq t_s$ and $u(t) = 0$ otherwise. Then, the approximation is
% If the step in $u$ occurs at time $t_s$, the approximation is
%
\begin{align}
    y(t) &\approx \frac{1}{1 + \exp(-\sigma(t - t_{50}))} = \tilde y(t),
\end{align}
%
where $t_{50} = t_s + \tau_d$ is the time at which $\tilde y$ is halfway between the value of $u$ before and after the step.
