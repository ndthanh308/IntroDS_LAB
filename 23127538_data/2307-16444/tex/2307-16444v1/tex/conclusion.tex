\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
We present a critical discussion of five commonly used mathematical models of gastrointestinal meal glucose absorption. We compare their predictions of the glucose rate of appearance in the blood plasma, and we provide an overview of key aspects of the models, including linearity and the types of equations in the models. The models are relevant to accurate simulation of the metabolism in healthy, diabetic, and obese people, and they can be used to test and develop treatment and prevention strategies.

Furthermore, we discuss general modeling aspects relevant to systematic modeling of meal glucose absorption. Specifically, we discuss model structures, meal input representations, delay approximations, general formulations of stoichiometry and reaction kinetics, and general CSTR and PFR models which can represent different parts and processes in the human metabolism.
