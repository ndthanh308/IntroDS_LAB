  abstract = {Active systems are characterized by a continuous production of entropy at steady state. We study the statistics of entropy production within a lattice-based model of interacting active particles that is capable of motility-induced phase separation. Exploiting a recent formulation of the exact fluctuating hydrodynamics for this model, we provide analytical results for its entropy production statistics in both typical and atypical (biased) regimes. This complements previous studies of the large deviation statistics of entropy production in off-lattice active particle models that could only be addressed numerically. Our analysis uncovers an unexpectedly intricate phase diagram, with five different phases arising (under bias) within the parameter regime where the unbiased system is in its homogeneous state. Notably, we find the concurrence of first order and second order nonequilibrium phase transition curves at a bias-induced tricritical point, a feature not yet reported in previous studies of active systems.},

  abstract = {Extending the famous Model B for the time evolution of a liquid mixture, we derive an approximate expression for the mobility matrix that couples the different mixture components. This approach is based on a single component fluid with particles that are artificially grouped into separate species labelled by ``colors''. The resulting mobility matrix depends on a single dimensionless parameter, which can be determined efficiently from experimental data or numerical simulations, and includes existing standard forms as special cases. We identify two distinct mobility regimes, corresponding to collective motion and interdiffusion, respectively, and show how they emerge from the microscopic properties of the fluid. As a test scenario, we study the dynamics after a thermal quench, providing a number of general relations and analytical insights from a Gaussian theory. Specifically, for systems with two or three components, analytical results for the time evolution of the equal time correlation function compare well to results of Monte Carlo simulations of a lattice gas. A rich behavior is observed, including the possibility of transient fractionation.},

This diffusion coefficient is, in principle, determined by a Green\textendash Kubo formula. In practice, even when the equilibrium properties of a lattice gas are analytically known, the diffusion coefficient cannot be computed except when a lattice gas additionally satisfies the gradient condition. We develop a procedure to systematically obtain analytical approximations for the diffusion coefficient for non-gradient lattice gases with known equilibrium. The method relies on a variational formula found by Varadhan and Spohn which is a version of the Green\textendash Kubo formula particularly suitable for diffusive lattice gases. Restricting the variational formula to finite-dimensional sub-spaces allows one to perform the minimization and gives upper bounds for the diffusion coefficient. We apply this approach to a kinetically constrained non-gradient lattice gas in two dimensions, viz. to the Kob\textendash Andersen model on the square lattice.},

The Green-Kubo formula for diffusivity can be represented as a variational formula, but even when the equilibrium properties of a lattice gas are analytically known, the diffusion coefficient can be computed only in the exceptional situation when the lattice gas is gradient. In the general case, minimization over an infinite-dimensional space is required. We propose an approximation scheme based on minimizing over finite-dimensional subspaces of functions. The procedure is demonstrated for one-dimensional generalized exclusion processes in which each site can accommodate at most two particles. Our analytical predictions provide upper bounds for the diffusivity that are very close to simulation results throughout the entire density range. We also analyze nonequilibrium density profiles for finite chains coupled to reservoirs. The predictions for the profiles are in excellent agreement with simulations.},

Our theory is valid in the low-density regime, and it makes different predictions about situations in which lanes may form that are not parallel with the direction of flow. We report on experiments with human crowds that verify two notable consequences of this phenomenon: tilting lanes under broken chiral symmetry and lane nucleation along elliptic, parabolic, and hyperbolic curves in the presence of sources or sinks.},

Thus, the C-S model cannot describe a phenomenon caused by different ``internal energy (temperatures)'' between particles. Recently, a new particle model for flocking was proposed to model a flocking dynamics in an ensemble of thermodynamic particles on time-independent communication networks, where spatial dependence in the communication was neglected. In this paper, we extend a thermodynamically consistent particle to incorporate communications depending on the positions of the particle and study its asymptotic dynamics, such as formation and nonexistence of mono-cluster flockings in terms of an initial configuration, coupling strength, and ansatz of the communication weights.},

Here, we give a brief survey of experimental observations and review the theoretical description of self-propelled rods. Our focus is on the emergent pattern formation of ensembles of dry self-propelled rods governed by short-ranged, contact mediated interactions and their wet counterparts that are also subject to long-ranged hydrodynamic flows. Altogether, self-propelled rods provide an overarching theme covering many aspects of active matter containing well-explored limiting cases. Their collective behavior not only bridges the well-studied regimes of polar self-propelled particles and active nematics, and includes active phase separation, but also reveals a rich variety of new patterns.},

This class of materials has polar symmetry at the microscopic level, but forms macrostates of nematic symmetry. We highlight three key features of the dynamics. First, as in polar active fluids, the control parameter for the order-disorder transition, namely the density, is dynamically convected by the order parameter via active currents. The resulting dynamical self-regulation of the order parameter is a generic property of active fluids and destabilizes the uniform nematic state near the mean-field transition. Secondly, curvature-driven currents render the system unstable deep in the nematic state, as found previously. Finally, and unique to self-propelled nematics, nematic order induces local polar order that in turn leads to the growth of density fluctuations. We propose this as a possible mechanism for the smectic order of polar clusters seen in numerical simulations.},

The analysis is motivated by the formulation of the system as a formal gradient flow for an appropriate energy functional consisting of entropic terms as well as quadratic nonlocal terms. Key ingredients are entropy dissipation methods as well as the recently developed boundedness by entropy principle. Moreover, we investigate phase separation effects inherent in the cross-diffusion model by an analytical and numerical study of minimizers of the energy functional and their asymptotics to a previously studied case as the diffusivity tends to zero. Finally we briefly discuss coarsening dynamics in the system, which can be observed in numerical results and is motivated by rewriting the PDEs as a system of nonlocal Cahn\textendash Hilliard equations.},

We consider the regime of high rotational diffusion, resulting in an equation for the spatial density that allows us to compare the effective excluded volume of a hard-needle system with that of a hard-sphere system. We further consider spatially homogeneous solutions and find an isotropic to nematic transition as density increases, consistent with Onsager's theory.},

  abstract = {Stochastic models of diffusion with excluded-volume effects are used to model many biological and physical systems at a discrete level. The average properties of the population may be described by a continuum model based on partial differential equations. In this paper we consider multiple interacting subpopulations/species and study how the inter-species competition emerges at the population level. Each individual is described as a finite-size hard core interacting particle undergoing Brownian motion. The link between the discrete stochastic equations of motion and the continuum model is considered systematically using the method of matched asymptotic expansions. The system for two species leads to a nonlinear cross-diffusion system for each subpopulation, which captures the enhancement of the effective diffusion rate due to excluded-volume interactions between particles of the same species, and the diminishment due to particles of the other species. This model can explain two alternative notions of the diffusion coefficient that are often confounded, namely collective diffusion and self-diffusion. Simulations of the discrete system show good agreement with the analytic results.},

These laws enforce the Boltzmann distribution in thermal equilibrium: The steady state is then independent of kinetic parameters. In contrast, self-propelled particles tend to accumulate where they move more slowly. They may also slow down at high density for either biochemical or steric reasons. This creates positive feedback, which can lead to motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) between dense and dilute fluid phases. At leading order in gradients, a mapping relates variable-speed, self-propelled particles to passive particles with attractions. This deep link to equilibrium phase separation is confirmed by simulations but generally breaks down at higher order in gradients: New effects, with no equilibrium counterpart, then emerge. We give a selective overview of the fast-developing field of MIPS, focusing on theory and simulation but including a brief speculative survey of its experimental implications.},

Run-and-tumble particles (RTPs, such as motile bacteria) swim with constant u until a random tumble event suddenly decorrelates the orientation. We show that when the motility parameters depend on density {$\rho$} but not on u, the coarse-grained fluctuating hydrodynamics of interacting ABPs and RTPs can be mapped onto each other and are thus strictly equivalent. In both cases, a steeply enough decreasing v({$\rho$}) causes phase separation in dimensions d = 2,3, even when no attractive forces act between the particles. This points to a generic role for motility-induced phase separation in active matter. However, we show that the ABP/RTP equivalence does not automatically extend to the more general case of u-dependent motilities.},

To simulate this system, it is necessary to provide an approximation of the so-called self-diffusion coefficient matrix of the tagged particle process. Classical algorithms for the computation of this matrix are based on the estimation of the long-time limit of the average mean square displacement of the particle. In this work, as an alternative, we propose a novel approach for computing the self-diffusion coefficient using deterministic low-rank approximation techniques, as the minimum of a high-dimensional optimization problem.

Several studies have sought to describe such transport processes using either a continuous time random walk or fractional order differential equation. For both these models the transport is characterized by a parameter {$\alpha$}, where {$\alpha$} = 1 is associated with Fickian diffusion and {$\alpha$} {$<$} 1 is associated with anomalous subdiffusion. Here, we simulate a single agent migrating through a crowded environment populated by impenetrable, immobile obstacles and estimate {$\alpha$} from mean squared displacement data. We also simulate the transport of a population of such agents through a similar crowded environment and match averaged agent density profiles to the solution of a related fractional order differential equation to obtain an alternative estimate of {$\alpha$}. We examine the relationship between our estimate of {$\alpha$} and the properties of the obstacle field for both a single agent and a population of agents; we show that in both cases, {$\alpha$} decreases as the obstacle density increases, and that the rate of decrease is greater for smaller obstacles. Our work suggests that it may be inappropriate to model transport through a crowded environment using widely reported approaches including power laws to describe the mean squared displacement and fractional order differential equations to represent the averaged agent density profiles.},

Such behaviors are often modeled by active matter, in which each individual is self-driven and tends to update its velocity depending on the one of its neighbors. In a classical model introduced by Vicsek \& al., as well as in numerous related active matter models, a phase transition between chaotic behavior at high temperature and global order at low temperature can be observed. Even though ample evidence of these phase transitions has been obtained for collective dynamics, from a mathematical standpoint, such active systems are not fully understood yet. Signicant progress has been achieved in the recent years under an assumption of mean-eld interactions, however to this day, few rigorous results have been obtained for models involving purely local interactions. In this paper, we describe a lattice active particle system, in which particles interact locally to align their velocities. We obtain rigorously, using the formalism developed for hydrodynamic limits of lattice gases, the scaling limit of this out-of-equilibrium system, for which numerous technical and theoretical diculties arise.},

Inspired by this formal link and the fact that the associated aggregation equation also dissipates the kinetic energy, we present a novel way of interpreting the aggregation equation as a gradient flow, in the sense of curves of maximal slope, of the kinetic energy, rather than the usual interaction energy, with respect to an appropriately constructed transportation metric on the space of probability measures.},

  abstract = {Spatial organization and noise play an important role in molecular systems biology. In recent years, a number of software packages have been developed for stochastic spatio-temporal simulation, ranging from detailed molecular-based approaches to less detailed compartment-based simulations. Compartment-based approaches yield quick and accurate mesoscopic results, but lack the level of detail that is characteristic of the computationally intensive molecular-based models. Often microscopic detail is only required in a small region (e.g. close to the cell membrane). Currently, the best way to achieve microscopic detail is to use a resource-intensive simulation over the whole domain. We develop the two-regime method (TRM) in which a molecular-based algorithm is used where desired and a compartment-based approach is used elsewhere. We present easy-to-implement coupling conditions which ensure that the TRM results have the same accuracy as a detailed molecular-based model in the whole simulation domain. Therefore, the TRM combines strengths of previously developed stochastic reaction\textendash diffusion software to efficiently explore the behaviour of biological models. Illustrative examples and the mathematical justification of the TRM are also presented.},

  abstract = {Collective phenomena in animal groups have attracted much attention in the last years, becoming one of the hottest topics in ethology. There are various reasons for this. On the one hand, animal grouping provides a paradigmatic example of self-organization, where collective behavior emerges in absence of centralized control. The mechanism of group formation, where local rules for the individuals lead to a coherent global state, is very general and transcends the detailed nature of its components. In this respect, collective animal behavior is a subject of great interdisciplinary interest. On the other hand, there are several important issues related to the biological function of grouping and its evolutionary success. Research in this field boasts a number of theoretical models, but much less empirical results to compare with. For this reason, even if the general mechanisms through which self-organization is achieved are qualitatively well understood, a quantitative test of the models assumptions is still lacking. New analysis on large groups, which require sophisticated technological procedures, can provide the necessary empirical data.},

We reveal intrinsically nonequilibrium effects, such as enhanced diffusivity of the tracer induced by both the crowding interactions and the external driving.

The main feature of these systems is that the diffusion matrix may be generally neither symmetric nor positive semi-definite. The key idea is to employ a transformation of variables, determined by the entropy density, which is defined by the gradient-flow formulation. The transformation yields at the same time a positive semi-definite diffusion matrix, suitable gradient estimates as well as lower and/or upper bounds of the solutions. These bounds are a consequence of the transformation of variables and are obtained without the use of a maximum principle. Several classes of cross-diffusion systems are identified which can be solved by this technique. The systems are formally derived from continuous-time random walks on a lattice modeling, for instance, the motion of ions, cells, or fluid particles. The key conditions for this approach are identified and previous results in the literature are unified and generalized. New existence results are obtained for the population model with or without volume filling.},

His intention was to prepare a text that was as self-contained as possible. lt would include, for instance, all tools from Markov process theory ( cf. Appendix 1, Chaps. 2 and 4) necessary to enable mathematicians and mathematical physicists with some knowledge of probability, at the Ievel of Chung (1974), to understand the techniques of the theory of hydrodynamic Iimits of interacting particle systems. In the fall of 1991 Claude invited me to complete his notes with him and transform them into a book that would present to a large audience the latest developments of the theory in a simple and accessible form. To concentrate on the main ideas and to avoid unnecessary technical difficulties, we decided to consider systems evolving in finite lattice spaces and for which the equilibrium states are product measures. To illustrate the techniques we chose two well-known particle systems, the generalized exclusion processes and the zero-range processes. We also conceived the book in such a manner that most chapters can be read independently of the others. Here are some comments that might help readers find their way.},

  abstract = {We consider a two-species simple exclusion process on a periodic lattice. We use the method of matched asymptotics to derive evolution equations for the two population densities in the dilute regime, namely a cross-diffusion system of partial differential equations for the two species' densities. First, our result captures non-trivial interaction terms neglected in the mean-field approach, including a non-diagonal mobility matrix with explicit density dependence. Second, it generalises the rigorous hydrodynamic limit of Quastel (Commun Pure Appl Math 45(6):623\textendash 679, 1992), valid for species with equal jump rates and given in terms of a non-explicit self-diffusion coefficient, to the case of unequal rates in the dilute regime. In the equal-rates case, by combining matched asymptotic approximations in the low- and high-density limits, we obtain a cubic polynomial approximation of the self-diffusion coefficient that is numerically accurate for all densities. This cubic approximation agrees extremely well with numerical simulations. It also coincides with the Taylor expansion up to the second-order in the density of the self-diffusion coefficient obtained using a rigorous recursive method.},

We show that our approximation is accurate for a very wide range of parameters, and that it correctly captures numerous nonequilibrium effects, which are the signature of the activity in the system. In addition to the determination of the diffusion coefficient of the tracer, our approach allows us to characterize the perturbation of the environment induced by the displacement of the active tracer. Finally, we consider the asymptotic regimes of low and high densities, in which the expression of the diffusion coefficient of the tracer becomes explicit, and which we argue to be exact.},

In this work, we propose a continuum model of pattern formation due to nonreciprocal interaction between multiple species of scalar active matter. The classical Cahn-Hilliard model is minimally modified by supplementing the equilibrium Ginzburg-Landau dynamics with particle-number-conserving currents, which cannot be derived from a free energy, reflecting the microscopic departure from action-reaction symmetry. The strength of the asymmetry in the interaction determines whether the steady state exhibits a macroscopic phase separation or a traveling density wave displaying global polar order. The latter structure, which is equivalent to an active self-propelled smectic phase, coarsens via annihilation of defects, whereas the former structure undergoes Ostwald ripening. The emergence of traveling density waves, which is a clear signature of broken time-reversal symmetry in this active system, is a generic feature of any multicomponent mixture with microscopic nonreciprocal interactions.},

Several approximate schemes have been invented to handle such cases, but little emphasis has been placed on testing the correctness of the integration scheme.

On the example of aerobic bacteria Bacillus subtilis, we report on spatial and temporal correlation functions measurements of collective state for various swimming speeds and concentrations. The experiments produced a puzzling result: while the energy injection rate is proportional to the swimming speed and concentration, the correlation length remains practically constant upon small speeds where random tumbling of bacteria dominates.

We show that the transition to collective motion amounts in this model to a bona fide liquid-gas phase transition in the canonical ensemble. The phase diagram in the density-velocity parameter plane has a critical point at zero velocity which belongs to the Ising universality class. In the density-temperature ``canonical'' ensemble, the usual critical point of the equilibrium liquid-gas transition is sent to infinite density because the different symmetries between liquid and gas phases preclude a supercritical region. We build a continuum theory which reproduces qualitatively the behavior of the microscopic model. In particular, we predict analytically the shapes of the phase diagrams in the vicinity of the critical points, the binodal and spinodal densities at coexistence, and the speeds and shapes of the phase-separated profiles.},

Here, we develop and explore this strategy in more detail and show explicitly how to get to such a large-scale, mean-field description starting from the microscopic dynamics. The effective free energy emerging from this approach has the form of a conventional Ginzburg-Landau function. On the coarsest scale, our results thus agree with the mapping of active phase separation onto that of passive fluids with attractive interactions through a global effective free energy (motility-induced phase transition). Particular attention is paid to the square-gradient term necessary for the phase separation kinetics. We finally discuss results from numerical simulations corroborating the analytical results.},

As in a purely active system, motility of the active component triggers phase separation into a dense and a dilute phase; in the dense phase, we further find active-passive segregation, with ``rafts'' of passive particles in a ``sea'' of active particles. We find that phase separation from an initially disordered mixture can occur with as little as 15\% of the particles being active. Finally, we show that a system prepared in a suitable fully segregated initial state reproducibly self-assembles an active ``corona,'' which triggers crystallization of the passive core by initiating a compression wave. Our findings are relevant to the experimental pursuit of directed self-assembly using active particles.},

Particles wait for an exponential time, pick a random jump size x with probability p(x), and try to jump to a new site defined by a jump equal to x. If the site is free, the jump is completed and things start all over again. Otherwise the jump is disallowed and things start all over again with the particle remaining in the old site. All the particles are doing this simultaneously and independently of each other. See [3] for a discussion of the model.},

The observations we report on include systems consisting of units ranging from macromolecules through metallic rods and robots to groups of animals and people. Some emphasis is put on models that are simple and realistic enough to reproduce the numerous related observations and are useful for developing concepts for a better understanding of the complexity of systems consisting of many simultaneously moving entities. As such, these models allow the establishing of a few fundamental principles of flocking. In particular, it is demonstrated, that in spite of considerable differences, a number of deep analogies exist between equilibrium statistical physics systems and those made of self-propelled (in most cases living) units. In both cases only a few well defined macroscopic/collective states occur and the transitions between these states follow a similar scenario, involving discontinuity and algebraic divergences.},

By a stability analysis of the field theory, we obtain equations for the spinodal that describes the onset of a motility-induced instability leading to cluster formation in such mixtures. The prediction for the spinodal is found to be in good agreement with particle-resolved computer simulations. Furthermore, we show that in active-passive mixtures the spinodal instability can be of two different types. One type is associated with a stationary bifurcation and occurs also in one-component active systems, whereas the other type is associated with a Hopf bifurcation and can occur only in active-passive mixtures. Remarkably, the Hopf bifurcation leads to moving clusters. This explains recent results from simulations of active-passive particle mixtures, where moving clusters and interfaces that are not seen in the corresponding one-component systems have been observed.},

Coarse-grained models of this process show time-reversal symmetry (detailed balance) to be restored for uniform states, but broken by gradient terms; hence, detailed-balance violation is strongly coupled to interfacial phenomena. To explore the subtle generic physics resulting from such coupling, we here introduce `Active Model B'. This is a scalar {$\varphi$}4 field theory (or phase-field model) that minimally violates detailed balance via a leading-order square-gradient term. We find that this additional term has modest effects on coarsening dynamics, but alters the static phase diagram by creating a jump in (thermodynamic) pressure across flat interfaces. Both results are surprising, since interfacial phenomena are always strongly implicated in coarsening dynamics but are, in detailed-balance systems, irrelevant for phase equilibria.},

A novel steady-state of well-defined propagating interfaces is observed, where the interface between the dense and the dilute phase propagates and the bulk of both phases is (nearly) at rest. Two kind of interfaces, advancing and receding, are formed by spontaneous symmetry breaking, induced by an instability of a planar interface due to the formation of localized vortices. The propagation arises due to flux imbalance at the interface, resembling the growth behavior of rough surfaces far from equilibrium. Above a threshold, the interface velocity decreases linearly with increasing fraction of active particles.},

We demonstrate that nonreciprocity, which is encoded in the model via antagonistic cross-diffusivities, provides a generic mechanism for the emergence of traveling patterns in purely diffusive systems with conservative dynamics. In the absence of nonreciprocity, the binary fluid mixture undergoes a phase transition from a homogeneous mixed state to a demixed state with spatially separated regions rich in one of the two components. Above a critical value of the parameter tuning nonreciprocity, the static demixed pattern acquires a finite velocity, resulting in a state that breaks both spatial and time-reversal symmetry, as well as the reflection parity of the static pattern. We elucidate the generic nature of the transition to traveling patterns using a minimal model that can be studied analytically. Our work has direct relevance to nonequilibrium assembly in mixtures of chemically interacting colloids that are known to exhibit nonreciprocal effective interactions, as well as to mixtures of active and passive agents where traveling states of the type predicted here have been observed in simulations. It also provides insight on transitions to traveling and oscillatory states seen in a broad range of nonreciprocal systems with nonconservative dynamics, from reaction\textendash diffusion and prey\textendash predators models to multispecies mixtures of microorganisms with antagonistic interactions.},

In all cases, the perpendicular state appears for weak driving, consistent with previous work. For strong driving, we introduce two models that support the parallel state. In one model, this state occurs because of the inclusion of dynamical rules that enhance lateral diffusion during collisions; in the other, it is a result of a nearest-neighbor attractive or repulsive interaction between particles of the same or opposite species. We discuss the connections between these results and the behavior found in off-lattice systems, including laning and freezing by heating.},
