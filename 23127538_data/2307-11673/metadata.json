  "abstract": "We consider a lattice model of active matter with exclusion and derive its hydrodynamic description exactly. The hydrodynamic limit leads to an integro-differential equation for the density of particles with a given orientation. Volume exclusion results in nonlinear mobility dependent on spatial density. Such models of active matter can support motility-induced phase separation, which occurs despite the absence of attractive interactions. We study the onset of phase separation with linear stability analysis and numerical simulations.",

  "comment": "Since submitting, we discovered an error in the code used to produce the PDE solutions. This does not change the article's central message, and we apologise for the oversight. Figures and descriptions have been corrected in the revised article. Only Figure 1 has significantly changed and the alignment between the linear stability analysis and PDE solutions has improved. 32 Pages, 8 figures",
