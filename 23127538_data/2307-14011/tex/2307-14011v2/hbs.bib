abstract = {Three decades after their discovery, the unique long-range structure of quasicrystals still poses a perplexing puzzle. The fact that some ancient Islamic patterns share similar quasi-periodic symmetries has prompted several scientists to investigate their underlying geometry and construction methods. However, available structural models depend heavily on local rules and hence they were unable to explain the global long-range order of Islamic quasi-periodic patterns. This paper shows that ancient designers, using simple consecutive geometry, have resolved the complicated long-range principles of quasi-periodic formations. Derived from these principles, a global multi-level structural model is presented that is able to describe the global long-range translational and orientational order of quasi-periodic formations. The proposed model suggests that the position of building units, locally and globally, is defined by one framework, and not tiled based on local rules (matching, overlapping or subdividing). In this way, quasi-periodic formations can grow rapidly ad infinitum without the need for any defects or mismatches. The proposed model, which presents a novel approach to the study of quasi-periodic symmetries, will hopefully provide a deeper understanding of the structure of quasicrystals at an atomic scale, allowing scientists to achieve improved control over their composition and structure.},

        abstract = {Quasicrystals are non-periodic solids that were discovered in 1982 by Dan Shechtman, Nobel Prize Laureate in Chemistry 2011. The underlying mathematics, known as the theory of aperiodic order, is the subject of this comprehensive multi-volume series. This first volume provides a graduate-level introduction to the many facets of this relatively new area of mathematics. Special attention is given to methods from algebra, discrete geometry and harmonic analysis, while the main focus is on topics motivated by physics and crystallography. In particular, the authors provide a systematic exposition of the mathematical theory of kinematic diffraction. Numerous illustrations and worked-out examples help the reader to bridge the gap between theory and application. The authors also point to more advanced topics to show how the theory interacts with other areas of pure and applied mathematics.}

Owing to overlaps, Gummelt arrangement of decorated decagons gives rise to nine different (context-dependent) decagon decorations in the covering. The inflation rules for decagons for each of nine types are presented and it is shown that inflations from differently typed decagons always produce different decorations of inflated decagons. However, if the original decagon region is divided into `equivalent' rhombus Penrose tiles, typed-decagon arrangements in the tiles (of the same shape) become identical for the fourfold inflated decagons. This implies that a decagonal quasi-unit-cell model can be reinterpreted as a Penrose-tile model with fourfold deflated supertiles.},

These tiles enabled the creation of increasingly complex periodic girih patterns, and by the 15th century, the tessellation approach was combined with self-similar transformations to construct nearly perfect quasi-crystalline Penrose patterns, five centuries before their discovery in the West.},

%abstract = {We incorporate realistic pair-potential energies directly into a non-linear least-square fit of diffraction data to quantitatively compare structure models with experimental data for the Ni-rich d(AlNiCo) quasicrystal. The initial structure models are derived from a few a priori assumptions (gross features of the Patterson function) and the pair-potentials. In place of the common hyperspace approach to the structure refinement of quasicrystals, we use a real-space tile-decoration scheme, which does not rely on strict quasiperiodicity, and makes it easy to enforce sensible local arrangements of the atoms. Inclusion of the energies provides information complementary to the diffraction data and protects the fit procedure from converging on spurious solutions. The method pinpoints sites that are likely to break the symmetry of their local environment.}

abstract = {More than 35 years and 11000 publications after the discovery of quasicrystals by Dan Shechtman, quite a bit is known about their occurrence, formation, stability, structures and physical properties. It has also been discovered that quasiperiodic self-assembly is not restricted to intermetallics, but can take place in systems on the meso- and macroscales. However, there are some blank areas, even in the centre of the big picture. For instance, it has still not been fully clarified whether quasicrystals are just entropy-stabilized high-temperature phases or whether they can be thermodynamically stable at 0K as well. More studies are needed for developing a generally accepted model of quasicrystal growth. The state of the art of quasicrystal research is briefly reviewed and the main as-yet unanswered questions are addressed, as well as the experimental limitations to finding answers to them. The focus of this discussion is on quasicrystal structure analysis as well as on quasicrystal stability and growth mechanisms.},

abstract = {Specific structural repeat units can be used as quasi-unit cells of decagonal quasicrystals. So far, the most famous and almost exclusively employed one has been the Gummelt decagon. However, in an increasing number of cases Lück decagons have been found to be more appropriate without going into depth. The diversities and commonalities of these two basic decagonal clusters and of some more general ones are discussed. The importance of the type of underlying tiling for the correct classification of a quasi-unit cell is demonstrated.},

The geometry underlying the acceptance domain involves self-similar fractals. Two methods of constructing the fractally shaped acceptance domain have been found.},
