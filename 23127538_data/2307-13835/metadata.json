  "abstract": "In work on the two alleles Moran model, Ewens showed that the stationary distribution for the number of genes of one type can be approximated by a Beta distribution. In this short note, we provide a sharp error term for this approximation. We show that this example fits perfectly into Doebler's framework for Beta approximation by Stein's method of exchangeable pairs.",
