  "abstract": "A surface in a three-dimensional metric Lie group $G$ is said invariant if it is invariant with respect to a one-dimensional subgroup $Γ$ of the isometry group of $G$. Is this work we focus on unimodular metric Lie groups $G$ that can be written as a semidirect product of the form $\\mathbb{R}^2\\rtimes_A \\mathbb{R}$ for certain matrix $A\\in \\mathcal{M}_2(\\mathbb{R})$ and study the minimal surfaces which are invariant under the group $Γ$ generated by left translations by elements in the vertical axis $\\{0\\}\\rtimes\\mathbb{R}$. We will call these surfaces vertically invariant. In particular, we describe new examples of minimal surfaces in $\\widetilde{E}(2)$ which are vertically invariant.",
