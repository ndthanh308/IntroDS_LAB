  "abstract": "Just before a nucleus fissions a neck is formed between the emerging fission fragments. It is widely accepted that this neck undergoes a rather violent rupture, despite no direct experimental evidence, and only a few contentious theoretical treatments of this fission stage were ever performed in the more than eight decades since nuclear fission was experimentally observed by Hahn and Strassmann and described by Meitner and Frisch in 1939. In the same year, Bohr and Wheeler conjectured that the fission of the nuclear liquid drop would likely be accompanied by the rapid formation of tiny droplets, later identified with either scission neutrons or other ternary fission fragments, a process which has not yet been discussed in a fully quantum many-body framework. The main difficulty in addressing both of these stages of nuclear fission is both are highly non-equilibrium processes. Here we will present the first fully microscopic characterization of the scission mechanism, along with the spectrum and the spatial distribution of scission neutrons, and some upper limit estimates for the emission of charged particles.",
