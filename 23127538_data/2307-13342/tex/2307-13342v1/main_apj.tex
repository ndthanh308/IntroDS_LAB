\begin{abstract}




Magnetic fields are ubiquitous in the interstellar medium, including extended objects such as supernova remnants (SNRs) and Pulsar Wind Nebulae (PWNe). Its turbulent characteristics govern the diffusion of cosmic rays and the multi-wavelength emission from PWNe. However, the geometry and turbulence nature of the magnetic fields in the ambient region of PWN is still unknown. Recent gamma-ray observations from HAWC and synchrotron observations suggest a highly suppressed diffusion coefficient compared to the mean interstellar value. In this letter, we present the first direct observational evidence that the local mean magnetic field is nearly aligned toward the line of sight (LoS) with an inclination angle $\theta_{\lambda} <10^{\circ}$  employing a recently developed statistical recipe known as `Y-parameter'. Furthermore, we report that the magnetic field fluctuations are mostly dominated by compressible modes, with a 2D correlation length of approximately $3 \ {\rm pc}$ in the vicinity of Monogem PWN region. Our study highlights the pivotal role of magnetic field and turbulence in unraveling the physical processes in TeV halos and cosmic ray transport.

\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}


The interstellar medium (ISM) and extended objects such as pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) and supernova remnants (SNRs) are permeated by the magnetic fields. This magnetic field exhibits a complex structure, spanning a wide range of strengths from $\mu {\rm G}$ to mG~\citep{Reynolds2012SSR}. The turbulent characteristics of this magnetic field play a crucial role in facilitating various physical processes, including particle transport and acceleration~\citep{schlickeiser2002statistical,2002PhRvL..89B1102Y, Yan2012ApJCR, Lemoine22, Yan2022rev}. Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence is classified into the incompressible Alfvénic mode and the compressible modes~\citep{CL03, LP12, Makwana2020}, and it interacts significantly with cosmic rays, governing their scattering and diffusion across different phases of the ISM as well as in the ambient regions of extended objects~\citep{YL2004ApJ, Yan2008ApJ}. Therefore, to comprehensively understand cosmic ray diffusion and multi-wavelength emissions in the vicinity of PWNe, it is essential to investigate the underlying magnetic field configuration and the nature of the associated turbulence.

Recent studies~\citep{Liu2019PRL, Breuhaus2022A&A, Mukhopadhyay2022PhRvD} have investigated the TeV's halo observations from PWNe using a theoretical spectrum generated through a combination of synchrotron radiation and inverse-Compton (IC) scattering from the same population of energetic electrons. The authors suggest that the suppressed diffusion in the ambient region of PWNe can be attributed to the topology of the local magnetic fields.


However, the direct observation of the orientation and strength of the magnetic field in the ambient halo region of pulsars has proven to be challenging. To address this issue, our recent study has employed turbulence mapping theory based on synchrotron emission statistics, presenting a novel statistical approach using the Y-parameter~\citep{Malik2023}. This technique has the potential to unveil the 3D geometry of magnetic fields and their dominant MHD turbulence characteristics. In this paper, we utilize the Y-parameter technique to provide the first observational investigation to constrain the magnetic field direction within these halos. %Furthermore, our findings will be supported by spectral analysis conducted across multiple wavelengths.



This paper is structured as follows: In Section \ref{pwn}, we examine the characteristics of the PWN TeV halo, with particular emphasis on the Monogem halo. Our primary analysis of diagnosing the local magnetic field inclination angle, utilizing the recently developed turbulence anisotropy analysis and the multi-points structure function, is described in Section \ref{sec:obs}. The discussions and summary of our findings are presented in Section \ref{discuss} and \ref{sec:conclusion}, respectively.


\section{Characteristic of PWN TeV halo}
\label{pwn}


The HAWC collaboration recently made notable discoveries of potential TeV sources, namely 2HWC J0635+180 and 2HWC J0700+143~\citep{2017ApJ...843...39A}, in the nearby PWN Geminga and PSR B0656+14 (Monogem) at significance levels of 13.1$\sigma$ and 8.1$\sigma$ respectively~\citep{2017ApJ...843...39A, Abeysekara2017Sci}. These sources are located at a relatively short distance from Earth, with Geminga at $250 \ {\rm pc}$ and Monogem at $288 \ {\rm pc}$. The diffusive propagation of particles within these halos extends to approximately $10-50 \ {\rm pc}$, which points to a much slower diffusion coefficient compared to the Galactic mean, presenting a challenge in comprehending the underlying mechanisms responsible for the observed high-energy emissions~\citep{Abeysekara2017Sci}.


In~\cite{Liu2019PRL}, the authors proposed a promising model for explaining the TeV observations of the Geminga PWN using anisotropic diffusion. In the case of sub-Alfv\'enic turbulence, the diffusion coefficients perpendicular and parallel to the mean magnetic field show significant differences (i.e., $D_{\perp} \sim D_{||} M_{A}^{4}$) (where $D_{\perp}$, $D_{\parallel}$ is diffusion coefficient in perpendicular and parallel direction of the magnetic field, respectively, $M_A$ represents Alfv\'enic Mach Number)~\citep{Yan2008ApJ, Giacinti2012PhRvL,lopez2018MNRAS, Maiti2022ApJ}. The authors of this theoretical model inferred that local magnetic fields with small inclination angles relative to the line of sight could account for the observed TeV emissions and the phenomenon of suppressed diffusion. Currently, direct measurements of the magnetic field strength and orientation are not feasible due to the absence of synchrotron polarized emissions in the vicinity of the Geminga PWN.

%As a consequence, the synchrotron polarised emission from the region would be anisotropic.

To get the first direct observational evidence, in this study, we focus on Monogem PWN (PSR B0656+14) which is observed in multi-wavelength from radio to gamma rays~\citep{Uyaniker1999A,  Johnston2006MNRAS,john2007MNRAS, Abeysekara2017Sci}. It has a period (P) of approximately $385 \ {\rm ms}$, period derivative ($\dot{\rm P}\sim 5.4 \times 10^{-14} \ {\rm s}\ {\rm s}^{-1}$) corresponding\footnote{See e.g. ~\cite{Lorimer2004book} for the formulae used to derive $\rm{\tau}$, $\dot{{\rm E}}_{rot}$ and $\rm{{\rm B}_{surf}}$ using ${\rm P}$ and ${\rm \dot{\rm P}}$} to a spin-down age ($\tau$) of approximately $111 \ {\rm kyr}$, a spin-down power (${\rm E}_{rot}$) of $3.8 \times 10^{34}$ erg ${\rm s}^{-1}$, and a surface magnetic field (${\rm B}_{surf}$) of approximately $4.65 \times 10^{12}$ G.

\subsection{Synchrotron Polarisation Observations}

In order to investigate the strength and morphology of magnetic fields in the Monogem PWN TeV halo region, we utilized the {\tt Effelsberg 100-m 21 cm POL}\footnote{https://www3.mpifr-bonn.mpg.de/survey.html} survey. This survey, conducted at medium Galactic latitudes, involves radio continuum and polarization observations. The data were obtained using the Effelsberg 100-m telescope at a frequency of $1.4 \ {\rm GHz}$, with an angular resolution of $9.35^{'}$ ~\citep{Uyaniker1999A}.

We specifically employed $5\degree\times5\degree$ synchrotron polarization observations of the Monogem (B0656+14) pulsar region, as depicted in Fig.~\ref{synchro}. The observation map was overlaid with streamlines computed using the Line Integral Convolution (LIC) algorithm, which indicates the inferred direction of the magnetic field based on the polarization direction~\citep{Leedom, ZOCKLER1997975}. The figure exhibits a significant increase in linearly polarized flux in and around the vicinity of the Monogem Pulsar, which is indicated by the black star symbol. The observed variations in streamlining suggest a 2D Alfv\'en Mach number in the pictorial plane approximately $M_{A,2D}\approx 1.0$. Utilizing this map, we examined the magnetic field topology in the surrounding region of the Monogem PWN.

\subsection{Correlation length from Structure-Function Analysis}
\label{result2}

In polarisation observations, the large-scale magnetic fields can coexist with the small-scale turbulent components. In recent studies~\citep{hildebrand2009ApJ,pattle2017ApJ,cho2019ApJ}
several approaches have been discussed to address this issue, including the fitting method and wavelet transformation~\citep{Grebenev1995ApJ}. These techniques heavily rely on data coarsening. One widely accepted and commonly used method for assessing fluctuations is through two-point structure function (SF), defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
    {\rm SF^{2pt}_{2}}({\bf R}) = \langle|X({\bf R}'+{\bf R})-X({\bf R})|^ 2\rangle_{{\bf R}'}
    \label{sf2}
\end{equation}
where $X$ represents an observable in the plane of the sky. ${\rm SF^{2pt}_{2}}$ will be an increasing function of ${\bf R}$ when we are in the regime of ${\bf R}<{\rm L_s}$, here ${\rm L_{s}}$ represents the correlation length of small-scale fluctuations. It will attain a plateau for ${\bf R}\gtrsim {\rm L_s}$. However, the shape of ${\rm SF^{2pt}_{2}}$ gets distorted in the presence of large-scale gradients in the observables. In this case, three and more point structure functions can be utilized to remove these large-scale variations ~\citep{cho2019ApJ}. The three points SF is expressed as;
\begin{equation}
    {\rm SF^{3pt}_{2}}({\bf R}) = \frac{1}{3}\langle|X({\bf R}'-{\bf R})-2 X({\bf R}')+X({\bf R}'+{\bf R})|^ 2\rangle_{{\bf R}'}.
    \label{sf3}
\end{equation}
     

The two-point structure function is represented by the red line in Fig~\ref{SF}. From the plot, it is evident that our region near Monogem PWN exhibits both large-scale gradients and small-scale fluctuations in the magnetic field. The three points ($3 \ {\rm pts}$) SF is depicted by the blue line in Fig.\ref{SF}. We want to emphasize that evaluating structure functions with more than two points limits us to smaller length scales, as evident in our SF plot in Fig.\ref{SF}.

Consequently, we determined that the region possesses a characteristic correlation length of approximately $3\ {\rm pc}$ for the local MHD turbulence, based on the synchrotron map. Furthermore, we can employ this 2D correlation length, $\tt R \sim 3\ {\rm pc}$, to conduct a turbulence anisotropy analysis known as the `Y-parameter' ~\citep{Malik2023}.

\subsection{Line of sight inclination angle of B-field from Y-parameter Analysis}


To measure the relative angle between the mean magnetic field and the line of sight, we employ a recently developed technique called the "y-parameter analysis" \citep{Malik2023}. It was suggested in earlier literature that the anisotropy of the Stokes parameters can be used to infer the geometric properties of the magnetic field. The global correlation function, represented as $D_X$, can effectively capture the anisotropy of a given observable, denoted as $X$, which can be expressed as follows:

\begin{equation}
    D_X({\bf R}) = \langle (X({\bf R}') X({\bf R}'+{\bf R}))^2\rangle_{{\bf R}'}.
    \label{eqd}
\end{equation}

\cite{Malik2023} suggest that the `Y-parameter", which is expressed as:

\begin{equation}
Y = \frac{\text{Anisotropy}(D_{I+Q})}{\text{Anisotropy}(D_{I-Q})} = \frac{v/h(D_{I+Q})}{v/h(D_{I-Q})}.
\label{eq_y}
\end{equation}
 can be used to trace the inclination angle of the magnetic field.  Here, $v$ and $h$ represent the vertical and horizontal dimensions relative to B$_{\perp}$. This statistical parameter, derived from polarized synchrotron radiation, captures the variations in the embedded magnetic fields resulting from turbulence. Consequently, it enables us to investigate the geometry of the 3D magnetic field and the characteristics of the underlying MHD turbulence. We established a statistical criterion of ${\rm Y} \sim 1.5\pm0.5$ (with ${\rm Y} > 1.5$ indicating the A mode and ${\rm Y} < 1.5$ indicating the C mode) to identify the dominant fraction of MHD turbulence modes. Remarkably, the Y-parameter for different modes exhibited contrasting trends (either decreasing or increasing) with respect to the local mean magnetic field inclination angle, denoted as $\theta_\lambda$. 
 


To estimate the mean-field inclination angle for the vicinity of the Monogem TeV halo, we applied the technique described earlier to synchrotron polarization observations (Fig.\ref{synchro}) within a ($5^\circ \times 5^\circ$) region around the Monogem pulsar. We initially analyzed the correlation function of $I+Q \propto B_x^2$ and $I-Q \propto B_y^2$ and plotted the results in Fig.~\ref{anisotropy}. These correlation function plots clearly depict the difference in horizontal and vertical lengths relative to the mean magnetic field direction. To quantify the anisotropies, we performed 2D Gaussian fittings on these distributions by keeping the fitting radius within the 2D correlation length of 3.0 pc and obtained ${\rm Y} \approx 0.83$. According to our previous investigation in ~\cite{Malik2023}, a ${\rm Y} < 1.0$ implies a mean magnetic field inclination angle of $\theta_\lambda < 10^\circ$ and indicates that the local turbulence is predominantly of compressible nature. 


These results clearly indicate that the vicinity of the PWNe exhibits a mean magnetic field that is potentially aligned with the line of sight, along with the presence of compressible turbulence. This alignment is crucial for the propagation of cosmic rays~\citep{Yan2008ApJ}. Importantly, our analysis provides direct observational confirmation for the speculation that the magnetic fields in such TeV halos are not in the extreme limit, as suggested in the existing literature. This finding offers reassurance regarding the effectiveness of the Y-parameter technique in retrieving 3D magnetic fields in various environments, including the ISM and extended objects such as PWNe and SNRs.

\section{Discussion} 
\label{discuss}


As discussed in Section~\ref{introduction}, MHD turbulence plays a crucial role in the acceleration and scattering of cosmic rays in the ISM and other extended objects. The recent discovery of TeV halos around middle-aged pulsars, such as Geminga and Monogem (PSR B0656+14), has raised intriguing questions, particularly the origin of the slower diffusion~\citep{Abeysekara2017Sci}. In a recent study by \cite{Liu2019PRL}, it was proposed that sub-Alfvenic turbulence combined with a local mean magnetic field aligned with the line of sight can account for the missing X-ray flux as well as the slow diffusion since $D_{\perp} = D_{\parallel} M_{A}^{4}$. Therefore, to obtain a comprehensive understanding of these observations, it is crucial to directly investigate the 3D magnetic field strength, orientation, and the underlying MHD turbulence.

To investigate the magnetic field topology in extended objects such as TeV halos associated with PWNe and supernova remnants, direct observational evidence is currently lacking. A recent study by \cite{Liu2019ApJ} has suggested an upper limit of $0.8 \ \mu {\rm G}$ for the magnetic field in the Geminga PWN, which is lower than the average galactic magnetic field strength ($\sim 5.5 \ \mu G$, \citealt{Sofue2019MNRAS}). The absence of radio-polarized emission in the vicinity of Geminga has hindered direct observations of the magnetic field strength and associated turbulence in that region.

In this study, we employ radio synchrotron polarization statistics from a ($5\degree\times5\degree$) region around the Monogem PWN to infer the nature of the 3D magnetic field and its turbulence using our Y-parameter technique, as described in~\cite{Malik2023}. Our analysis yielded a value of ${\rm Y\sim0.83}$ based on the 2D coherence length scale estimated using the structure-function in Fig.\ref{SF}. Following the criteria established in \cite{Malik2023}, we have identified two potential scenarios: one with $\theta_\lambda \lesssim 10^\circ$ dominated by compressible modes, and the other with $\theta_\lambda > 60^\circ$ characterized by Alfv'enic turbulence. Analysis of simulated MHD datacubes favours the first scenario over the others.

Furthermore, in the Monogem TeV halo, the required diffusion coefficient is also significantly suppressed compared to the ISM value, similar to the case of the Geminga TeV halo. This suppressed diffusion, combined with the small $\theta_\lambda$ angle, suggests that cross-field transport with $D_\perp\propto D_\| M_A^4$ serves as the underlying mechanism for the reduced diffusion \citep{Yan2008ApJ}. Assuming $D_\|\simeq D_{ISM}\sim 3.8\times 10^{28}$, the average ISM diffusion coefficient as adopted in ~\cite{Liu2019PRL}, we estimate a local Alfv\'enic Mach number $M_A\sim 0.2$. The results obtained using various diagnostics are summarized in the table below.

\end{longtable}


Additionally, in the halo-like environment, there are limited methods to gain insight into the strength of the parallel magnetic field component ($B_\|$). The rotation and dispersion measures of the pulsar might offer some clues about the $B_\|$\footnote{Using RM of $22.73\pm8.0 \ {\rm rad} \ {\rm m}^{-2}$ and DM of $13.7\pm0.2$ pc cm$^{-3}$, we can estimate the $B_\| \sim 2.04\pm0.72 \mu$G.} component of the magnetic field, but are also affected by foreground contamination. In any case, the magnetic field orientation can not be inferred from the observations of pulsars themselves. Therefore, our study facilitates a pivotal advancement in the understanding of magnetism and the underlying physical process governing the TeV-PeV halos associated with PWN and SNRs.



\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}
 

In this letter, we have presented the first observation analysis of magnetic field 3D geometry and underlying MHD turbulence nature in the TeV halo associated with the Monogem PWN using various probes from multi-wavelength observations. Our structure-function analysis shows that the region has a pictorial plane correlation length of $\sim 3\ {\rm pc}$ for the local MHD turbulence. Further, the Y-parameter analysis using synchrotron polarisation observations with ${\rm Y} \sim 0.83$ suggests that the local mean magnetic field has an inclination angle $\theta_\lambda < 10^\circ$ and is dominated by compressible turbulence fluctuations, both of which contribute to the suppressed diffusion of cosmic rays as observed by HAWC~\citep{Abeysekara2017Sci}.

Thus our study underpins the crucial role of the magnetic field in understanding the physical processes involved in recent and future detections of such extraordinary high-energy emissions in the Milky Way.
