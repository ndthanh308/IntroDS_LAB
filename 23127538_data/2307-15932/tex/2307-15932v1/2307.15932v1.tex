\begin{abstract}{A famous conjecture states that {\it any uniformly fully inert subgroup of a given group is commensurable with a fully invariant subgroup} (see \cite{DDR} and \cite{DDS}). In this short note, we settle this problem completely in the affirmative for an arbitrary Abelian group.}
\end{abstract}

\section{Notations and Notions}

Throughout this brief paper, all our groups are {\it additively} written and {\it Abelian}. Our notation and terminology are mainly standard and follow those from \cite{Kap}.

Recall the standard concept that a subgroup $F$ of an arbitrary group $G$ is said to be {\it fully invariant} if $\phi(F)\subseteq F$ for any endomorphism $\phi$ of $G$, while if $\phi$ is an invertible endomorphism (= an automorphism), then $F$ is said to be a {\it characteristic} subgroup. It is obvious that fully invariant subgroups are always characteristic, whereas the converse implication fails in general.

On the same vein, imitating \cite{DDS} and \cite{CDG}, respectively, a subgroup $S$ of a group $G$ is called {\it fully (resp., characteristically) inert}, provided $(\phi(S)+S)/S$ is finite for all endomorphisms, respectively automorphisms, $\phi$ of $G$. The first of these two concepts is known to be refined in \cite{DDR} and \cite{DDS} to the so-called {\it uniformly fully inert} subgroups by requiring the existence of a fixed positive integer $m$ such that the cardinality of the quotient-group $(\phi(S)+S)/S$ is bounded by $m$ (i.e., it has at most $m$ elements, for each endomorphism $\phi$ of $G$), while the second concept mentioned above was refined in \cite{DDR} by defining a subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ to be {\it uniformly characteristically inert}, provided there is a positive integer $k$ such that, for every automorphism $\varphi$ of $G$, the cardinality of the factor-group $(\varphi(H)+H)/H$ is bounded by $m$ (that is, it has no more than $k$ elements for each automorphism $\varphi$ of $G$).

Remember also that two subgroups $B$ and $C$ of a group $G$ are called {\it commensurable} and write for short that $B\sim C$ or, equivalently, that $C\sim B$ since this is a symmetric relation, provided that both quotients $(B+C)/B$ and $(B+C)/C$ are finite. It is worthwhile noticing that in many special cases a fully inert subgroup is commensurable with a fully invariant subgroups as well as a characteristically inert subgroup is commensurable with a characteristic subgroup. However, it is not so hard to construct a fully inert subgroup that is {\it not} commensurable with a fully invariant subgroup as well as a characteristically inert subgroup that is {\it not} commensurable with a characteristic subgroup. Nevertheless, it was shown in \cite[Corollary 1.9]{DDR} the important fact that any uniformly characteristically inert subgroup is commensurable a characteristic subgroup and, moreover, in a way of similarity it was conjectured in \cite[Conjecture 5.2]{DDR} that {\it every uniformly fully inert subgroup of a given (not necessarily Abelian) group is commensurable with a fully invariant subgroup} (see \cite[Conjecture 1.6]{DDS} too).

Our objective in the present short article is to give a complete positive solution of this difficult question in the next section.

\section{The Solution}

Our key tool, necessary to resolve the listed above conjecture, is the following straightforward but very useful statement. Note that the results from \cite{CDGM} and \cite{CDG} used in it below are formulated only for $p$-groups, for some fixed prime $p$, but actually they reamain valid for arbitrary groups.

\begin{proposition}\label{square} Let $G$ be a group. Then $G$ possesses the property that any its uniformly fully inert subgroup is commensurable with a fully invariant subgroup of $G$ if, and only if, the square-group $G\oplus G$ possesses the property that any its uniformly characteristically inert subgroup is commensurable with a characteristic subgroup of $G\oplus G$.
\end{proposition}

\Pf "$\Rightarrow$". Suppose $K = G_1\oplus G_2$, where $G_1\cong G\cong G_2$. An application of \cite{Kap} (see also \cite{CDG}) tells us that each endomorphism of $K$ is a sum of three automorphisms of $K$, so it then follows from \cite[Proposition 4.2]{CDG} that each uniformly characteristically inert subgroup $C$ of $K$ is uniformly fully inert in $K$ (notice the important fact that, in our situation, every endomorphism of $K$ is the sum of only three automorphisms of $K$). So, one can write that $C\sim C_1\oplus C_2$, where $C_1= C\cap G_1$, $C_2= C\cap G_2$, and $C_1$, $C_2$ are uniformly fully inert in $G_1$, $G_2$, respectively. Furthermore, if $\varphi: G_1\to G_2$
is an isomorphisms, then $\varphi(C_1)+C_2\sim C_2$ in accordance with \cite[Lemma 2.1]{CDGM}. By assumption, the subgroup $C_1$ is commensurable with a fully invariant subgroup, say $H_1$. Set $H_2=\varphi(H_1)$. Since
$G_1\cong G_2$, it is easily seen that $H=H_1\oplus H_2$ is fully invariant in $K$ and, consequently, by what we have shown above it follows at once that $H\sim C$, as needed.

"$\Leftarrow$". Suppose $H$ is an uniformly fully inert subgroup in $G$. Then, same as \cite[Theorem 4.6]{CDG}, we derive that $H\oplus H$ is an uniformly fully inert subgroup in $G\oplus G$, whence $H\oplus H\sim C$ for some characteristic subgroup $C$ in $G\oplus G$. But, by what we noted above that each endomorphism in a square-group is a sum of finitely many automorphisms, it is readily observed that $C$ is fully invariant in $G\oplus G$
and also is of the form $C=F\oplus F$, where $F$ is fully invariant in $G$ -- indeed, as $C$ is also fully invariant in $G\oplus G$, we then can write $C=(C\cap G)\oplus (C\cap G)$ and set $F=C\cap G$. Thus, we infer that $H\sim F$, as required.

We now come to our basic assertion that answers in the affirmative the aforementioned conjecture from 
\cite[Conjecture 5.2]{DDR} and \cite[Conjecture 1.6]{DDS}, respectively. It is worth noticing that some recent work on that conjecture related to $p$-groups was done in \cite{Keef} as well.

\begin{theorem}\label{fine} Any uniformly fully inert subgroup $H$ of a group $G$ is commensurable with some fully invariant subgroup of $G$.
\end{theorem}

\Pf We know that $H\oplus H$ is uniformly fully inert in $G\oplus G$ and so, in view of \cite[Corollary 1.9]{DDR},
$H\oplus H$ is commensurable with a characteristic subgroup $K$ of $G\oplus G$. But $K$ is fully invariant in
$G\oplus G$, and hence $K=(K\cap G)\oplus(K\cap G)$, where $K\cap G$ is fully invariant in $G$. However, $H$
is commensurable with $K\cap G$, as asked for.
