\caption{\label{tab:grecsystems}
An overview of the algorithms submitted to GREC. The first column contains the name of the respective algorithm. The column GREC ST presents the name of the \msr shared task to which the algorithm was submitted. The third column, ALG, lists the algorithms used, where abbreviations from top to bottom are C5.0 decision tree, conditional random field, memory-based learning, multi-layer perceptron, maximum entropy, and frequency-based rules. The fourth column, Acc, reports the original accuracy of the algorithms, as reported in \citet{belz2009generating}. Note that \udel, \icsi, and \texttt{JUNLG} were submitted to both the \msr’08 and \msr'09 shared tasks, and we only present the newest results here.
