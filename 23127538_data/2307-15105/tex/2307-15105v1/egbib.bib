from a pool of N records, where the value of N is unknown beforehand. The main result
of the paper is the design and analysis of Algorithm Z; it does the sampling in one
pass using constant space and in O(n(1 + log(N/n))) expected time, which is optimum,
up to a constant factor. Several optimizations are studied that collectively improve
the speed of the naive version of the algorithm by an order of magnitude. We give
an efficient Pascal-like implementation that incorporates these modifications and
that is suitable for general use. Theoretical and empirical results indicate that
Algorithm Z outperforms current methods by a significant margin.},

In fact, fully retraining models each time new data become available is infeasible, due to computational and storage issues, while naïve incremental strategies have been shown to suffer from catastrophic forgetting. In the context of real-world object recognition applications (e.g., robotic vision), where continuous learning is crucial, very few datasets and benchmarks are available to evaluate and compare emerging techniques. In this work we propose a new dataset and benchmark CORe50, specifically designed for continuous object recognition, and introduce baseline approaches for different continuous learning scenarios.}

abstract = {We report on an extensive study of the benefits and limitations of current deep learning approaches to object recognition in robot vision scenarios, introducing a novel dataset used for our investigation. To avoid the biases in currently available datasets, we consider a natural human–robot interaction setting to design a data-acquisition protocol for visual object recognition on the iCub humanoid robot. Analyzing the performance of off-the-shelf models trained off-line on large-scale image retrieval datasets, we show the necessity for knowledge transfer. We evaluate different ways in which this last step can be done, and identify the major bottlenecks affecting robotic scenarios. By studying both object categorization and identification problems, we highlight key differences between object recognition in robotics applications and in image retrieval tasks, for which the considered deep learning approaches have been originally designed. In a nutshell, our results confirm the remarkable improvements yield by deep learning in this setting, while pointing to specific open challenges that need be addressed for seamless deployment in robotics.}

abstract = {The vulnerability of face recognition systems against so-called morphing attacks has been revealed in the past years. Recently, different kinds of morphing attack detection approaches have been proposed. However, the vast majority of published results has been obtained from rather constrained experimental setups. In particular, most investigations do not consider variations in morphing techniques, image sources, and image post-processing. Hence, reported performance rates can not be maintained in realistic scenarios, as the NIST FRVT MORPH performance evaluation showed. In this work, existing algorithms are benchmarked on a new, more realistic database. This database consists of two different data sets, from which morphs were created using four different morphing algorithms. In addition, the database contains four different post-processings (including print-scan transformation and JPEG2000 compression). Further, a new morphing attack detection method based on a fusion of different configurations of Multi-scale Block Local Binary Patterns (MB-LBP) on an image divided into multiple cells is presented. The proposed score-level fusion of a maximum number of 18 different configurations is shown to significantly improve the robustness of the resulting morphing attack detection scheme, yielding an average performance between 2.26\% and 8.52\% in terms of Detection Equal Error Rate (D-EER), depending on the applied post-processing.},
