  "abstract": "We often encounter a situation that black hole solutions can be regarded as continuous deformations of simpler ones, or modify general relativity by continuous parameters. We develop a general framework to compute high-order perturbative corrections to quasinormal mode frequencies in such deformed problems. Our method has many applications, and allows to compute numerical values of the high-order corrections very accurately. For several examples, we perform this computation explicitly, and discuss analytic properties of the quasinormal mode frequencies for deformation parameters.",
