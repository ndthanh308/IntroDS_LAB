An efficient model finder must have a mechanism for specifying partial solutions, an effective symmetry detection and breaking scheme, and an economical translation from relational to boolean logic. These desiderata are addressed with three new techniques: a symmetry detection algorithm that works in the presence of partial solutions, a sparse-matrix representation of relations, and a compact representation of boolean formulas inspired by boolean expression diagrams and reduced boolean circuits. The presented techniques have been implemented and evaluated, with promising results.",

A first-order formula is translated to a quantifier-free boolean formula, which has a model when the original formula has a model within a given scope (that is, involving no more than some finite number of atoms). Because the satisfiable formulas that occur in practice tend to have small models, a small scope usually suffices and the analysis is efficient.The paper presents a simple logic and gives a compositional translation scheme. It also reports briefly on experience using the Alloy Analyzer, a tool that implements the scheme.},

abstract="Many domains such as scientific computing and neuroscience require end users to compose heterogeneous computational entities to automate their professional tasks. However, an issue that frequently hampers such composition is data-mismatches between computational entities. Although, many composition frameworks today provide support for data mismatch resolution through special-purpose data converters, end users still have to put significant effort in dealing with data mismatches, e.g., identifying the available converters and determining which of them meet their QoS expectations. In this paper we present an approach that eliminates this effort by automating the detection and resolution of data mismatches. Specifically, it uses architectural abstractions to automatically detect different types of data mismatches, model-generation techniques to fix those mismatches, and utility theory to decide the best fix based on QoS constraints. We illustrate our approach in the neuroscience domain where data-mismatches can be fixed in an efficient manner on the order of few seconds.",

However, research on security metrics has been hindered by difficulties in handling zero-day attacks exploiting unknown vulnerabilities. In fact, the security risk of unknown vulnerabilities has been considered as something unmeasurable due to the less predictable nature of software flaws. This causes a major difficulty to security metrics, because a more secure configuration would be of little value if it were equally susceptible to zero-day attacks. In this paper, we propose a novel security metric, k-zero day safety, to address this issue. Instead of attempting to rank unknown vulnerabilities, our metric counts how many such vulnerabilities would be required for compromising network assets; a larger count implies more security because the likelihood of having more unknown vulnerabilities available, applicable, and exploitable all at the same time will be significantly lower. We formally define the metric, analyze the complexity of computing the metric, devise heuristic algorithms for intractable cases, and finally demonstrate through case studies that applying the metric to existing network security practices may generate actionable knowledge.}, number={1}, journal={IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing}, author={Wang, Lingyu and Jajodia, Sushil and Singhal, Anoop and Cheng, Pengsu and Noel, Steven}, year={2013}, pages={30--44} }


 @article{Herlihy_Wing_1991, title={Specifying graceful degradation}, volume={2}, ISSN={1045-9219}, DOI={10.1109/71.80192}, abstractNote={A description is given of the relaxation lattice method, a new approach to specifying graceful degradation for a large class of programs. A relaxation lattice is a lattice of specifications parameterized by a set of constraints, where the stronger the set of constraints, the more restrictive the specification. While a program is able to satisfy its strongest set of constraints, it satisfies its preferred specification, but if changes to the environment force it to satisfy a weaker set, then it will permit additional weakly consistent computations which are undesired but tolerated. The use of relaxation lattices is illustrated by specifications for programs that tolerate (1) faults, such as site crashes and network partitions, (2) timing anomalies, such as attempting to read a value too soon after it was written, (3) synchronization conflicts, such as choosing the oldest unlocked item from a queue, and (4) security breaches, such as acquiring unauthorized capabilities.<>}, number={1}, journal={IEEE Transactions on Parallel and Distributed Systems}, author={Herlihy, M P and Wing, J M}, year={1991}, pages={93–104} }
