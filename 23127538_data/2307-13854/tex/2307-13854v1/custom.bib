@article{10.1561/1500000019,
 abstract = {The Probabilistic Relevance Framework (PRF) is a formal framework for document retrieval,
grounded in work done in the 1970—1980s, which led to the development of one of the
most successful text-retrieval algorithms, BM25. In recent years, research in the
PRF has yielded new retrieval models capable of taking into account document meta-data
(especially structure and link-graph information). Again, this has led to one of the
most successful Web-search and corporate-search algorithms, BM25F. This work presents
the PRF from a conceptual point of view, describing the probabilistic modelling assumptions
behind the framework and the different ranking algorithms that result from its application:
the binary independence model, relevance feedback models, BM25 and BM25F. It also
discusses the relation between the PRF and other statistical models for IR, and covers
some related topics, such as the use of non-textual features, and parameter optimisation
for models with free parameters.},

@inproceedings{10.1145/2872518.2890585,
 abstract = {The World Wide Web contains a large number of community created knowledge of instructional
nature. Similarly, in a commercial setting, databases of instructions are used by
customer-care providers to guide clients in the resolution of issues. Most of these
instructions are expressed in natural language. Knowledge Bases including such information
are valuable through the sum of their single entries. However, as each entry is created
mostly independently, users (e.g. other community members) cannot take advantage of
the accumulated knowledge that can be developed via the aggregation of related entries.
In this paper we consider the problem of inter-linking Knowledge Base entries, in
order to get relevant information from other parts of the Knowledge Base.To achieve
this, we propose to detect textit{actionable phrases} -- text fragments that describe
how to perform a certain action -- and link them to other entries. The extraction
method that we implement achieves an F-score of 67.35%. We also show that using actionable
phrases results in better linking quality than using coarser-grained spans of text,
as proposed in the literature. Besides the evaluation of both steps, we also include
a detailed error analysis and release our annotation to the community.},

@inproceedings{10.1145/584955.584977,
 abstract = {Language generation systems have often been advocated for use in the generation of
user documentation, but in practice, it is hard to use them because of the amount
of knowledge they require as input. Without a readily available source of input, the
knowledge acquisition bottleneck will prevent generation technology from ever being
used. Unfortunately, knowledge acquisition for any domain-varying language generation
application is difficult because there is seldom any single knowledge source or acquisition
method that is adequate for acquiring the appropriate knowledge. This paper argues
that this required knowledge can, in practice, be acquired from a heterogeneous set
of complementary sources. It then presents Isolde, a support environment for technical
writers that can mine these sources using an extensible set of specially tailored
acquisition tools. These tools acquire instructional knowledge on-the-fly and consolidate
it into a knowledge base that can drive instructional text generation.},

@article{azaria_agent_2020,
 abstract = {Teaching via natural language is an intuitive way for end users to add functionality to a virtual assistant, enabling them to personalize their assistant with new commands without requiring the intervention of the system developer, who cannot possibly anticipate all of an end user’s needs. In this paper we introduce our Learning by Instruction Agent (LIA), the ﬁrst virtual assistant, for an email domain, that is capable of learning how to perform new commands taught by end users in natural language. LIA grounds the semantics of each command in terms of primitive executable procedures. When a user provides LIA with a command that it does not understand, it prompts the user to explain the command through a sequence of natural language steps. From this input, LIA learns the meaning of the new command and how to generalize the command to novel situations. For example, having been taught how to “forward an email to Alice”, it can correctly understand “forward this email to Bob”. We show that users that were assigned to interact with LIA completed the task quicker than users assigned to interact with a non-learning agent. These results demonstrate the potential of natural language teaching to improve the capabilities of intelligent personal assistants. We annotated 4759 natural language statements with their associated computer readable execution commands (logical forms) to form a dataset (which we publicize in this paper). We present the performance of several different parser methods on this dataset.},

 abstract = {Unlike people, household robots cannot rely on commonsense knowledge when accomplishing everyday tasks. We believe that this is one of the reasons why they perform poorly in comparison to humans. By integrating extensive collections of commonsense knowledge into mobile robot’s knowledge bases, the work proposed in this paper enables robots to ﬂexibly infer control decisions under changing environmental conditions. We present a system that converts commonsense knowledge from the large Open Mind Indoor Common Sense database from natural language into a Description Logic representation that allows for automated reasoning and for relating it to other sources of knowledge.},

@article{sun_rtpo_2019,
 abstract = {Knowledge can enhance the intelligence of robots’ high-level decision-making. However, there is no specific domain knowledge base for robot task planning in this field. Aiming to represent the knowledge in robot task planning, the Robot Task Planning Ontology (RTPO) is first designed and implemented in this work, so that robots can understand and know how to carry out task planning to reach the goal state. In this paper, the RTPO is divided into three parts: task ontology, environment ontology, and robot ontology, followed by a detailed description of these three types of knowledge, respectively. The OWL (Web Ontology Language) is adopted to represent the knowledge in robot task planning. Then, the paper proposes a method to evaluate the scalability and responsiveness of RTPO. Finally, the corresponding task planning algorithm is designed based on RTPO, and then the paper conducts experiments on the basis of the real robot TurtleBot3 to verify the usability of RTPO. The experimental results demonstrate that RTPO has good performance in scalability and responsiveness, and the robot can achieve given high-level tasks based on RTPO.},

@inproceedings{tenorth_understanding_2010,
 abstract = {Service robots will have to accomplish more and more complex, open-ended tasks and regularly acquire new skills. In this work, we propose a new approach to the problem of generating plans for such household robots. Instead composing them from atomic actions — the common approach in robot planning — we propose to transform task descriptions on web sites like ehow.com into executable robot plans. We present methods for automatically converting the instructions from natural language into a formal, logic-based representation, for resolving the word senses using the WordNet database and the Cyc ontology, and for exporting the generated plans into the mobile robot’s plan language RPL. We discuss the problem of inferring information that is missing in these descriptions and the problem of grounding the abstract task descriptions in the perception and action system, and we propose techniques for solving them. The whole system works autonomously without human interaction. It has successfully been tested with a set of about 150 natural language directives, of which up to 80\% could be correctly transformed.},
