  "abstract": "The paradox of Bose-Einstein condensation is that phenomena such as the $λ$-transition heat capacity and superfluid flow are macroscopic, whereas the occupancy of the ground state is microscopic. This contradiction is resolved with a simple derivation for ideal bosons that shows Bose-Einstein condensation is into multiple low-lying states, not just the ground state.",
