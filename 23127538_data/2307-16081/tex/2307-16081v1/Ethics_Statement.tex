\section*{Ethics Statement}

We present a task bot that is able to converse with users to complete real-world tasks. No personal or identifying information is included throughout conversations. In addition, our bot includes a safety check to ensure safe conversations. We reject inappropriate task requests and prevent showing dangerous tasks, where users and their properties may get hurt. To this end, we perform rule-based matching against a keyword blacklist to filter out inappropriate tasks. Meanwhile, for response generation, we don't directly use LLMs (such as ChatGPT) to generate answers for users' questions, which will have the risk of leaking user data to third-party APIs. Instead, we utilize LLMs to do data augmentation and domain adaptation, and train models locally for the sake of privacy protection.
