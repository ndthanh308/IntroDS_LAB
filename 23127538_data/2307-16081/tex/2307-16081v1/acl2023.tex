\section*{Author Contributions}

In this work, each author makes significant contributions that collectively enhance the final outcome. Lingbo Mo played a crucial role in constructing and organizing the codebase, and building an interactive interface for the demo. Shijie Chen and Ziru Chen co-led the team during the challenge, laying the groundwork for the bot's development. Xiang Deng and Tianshu Zhang were responsible for the NLU pipeline. Xiang Yue mainly developed the QA module. Lingbo Mo and Zhen Wang worked together to build the backend knowledge base and the search engine. Samuel Stevens provided engineering support for constructing an automated test suite. Ashley Lewis focused on enhancing user engagement. Chang-You Tai contributed to chit-chat and PAK features, while Sunit Singh assisted in designing the demo interface. Huan Sun and Yu Su are faculty advisors and offered valuable guidance and feedback.
