We introduce \taco{}, a user-centered task-oriented digital assistant designed to guide users through complex real-world tasks with multiple steps. Covering a wide range of cooking and how-to tasks, we aim to deliver a collaborative and engaging dialogue experience. Equipped with language understanding, dialogue management, and response generation components supported by a robust search engine, \taco{} ensures efficient task assistance. To enhance the dialogue experience, we explore a series of data augmentation strategies using LLMs to train advanced neural models continuously. \taco{} builds upon our successful participation in the inaugural Alexa Prize TaskBot Challenge, where our team secured third place among ten competing teams. We offer \taco{} as an open-source framework that serves as a practical example for deploying task-oriented dialogue systems.\footnote{Code and datasets are available at \href{https://github.com/OSU-NLP-Group/TacoBot}{OSU-NLP/TacoBot}.}
