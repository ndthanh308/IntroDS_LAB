\label{conclusion}

In this paper, we introduce \taco{}, a modular task-oriented dialogue system that assists users in accomplishing intricate daily tasks. We propose a comprehensive set of modules and approaches to create a collaborative and engaging task bot. To ensure a strong foundation, we employ several data augmentation techniques leveraging LLMs. Furthermore, we open-source the framework and datasets, providing a valuable resource and inspiring future efforts to enhance user-bot collaboration.
