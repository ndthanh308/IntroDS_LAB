  "abstract": "In this paper, we present upper bounds for the depth of some classes of polyhedra, including: polyhedra with finite fundamental group, polyhedra $P$ with abelian or free $π_1(P)$ and finitely generated $H_i(tilde{P};\\mathbb{Z}$, 2-dimensional polyhedra with abelian or free fundamental group, and 2-dimensional polyhedra with elementary amenable fundamental group $G$ with finite cohomological dimension $cd(G)$. Furthermore, we provide some examples to show that some of these bounds are sharp.",
