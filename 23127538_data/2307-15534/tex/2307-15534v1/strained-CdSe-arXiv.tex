\begin{abstract}
An approach to analyzing the spinor wave functions that appear in the electronic structure
calculations when taking the spin-orbit interaction into account is developed. It is
based on the projection analysis of angular parts of wave functions onto irreducible
representations of the point group and analysis of the evolution of the energy levels
upon the adiabatic turning on the spin-orbit interaction. The technique is illustrated
by an example of the changes in the valence band structure in strained bulk CdSe with
zinc-blende structure. An analysis of the character of mixing of various branches of the
valence band supports the Luttinger--Kohn model of the valence band. It is shown that the
above calculations complemented by the Zeeman splitting in a magnetic field make it
possible to unambiguously determine the polarization of all optical transitions. Using
the spinor wave functions, matrix elements of optical transitions between the valence
subbands and the conduction band are calculated.

\section{Introduction}

Being one of the perturbation theory techniques, the ${\bf k \cdot p}$
method~\cite{SemicondSemimetals.1.Ch3,VoonWillatzen} found wide application in solid
state physics. Strictly speaking, the use of this method requires to know the energies
of an infinite number of bands and an infinite number of matrix elements.
L{\"o}wdin~\cite{JChemPhys.19.1396} proposed a mathematical trick that allowed to project
this problem onto a system with a finite number of bands. It is in this truncated form that
the ${\bf k \cdot p}$ method is usually used as an ``interpolation scheme'' to describe
the band structure of semiconductors in the vicinity of a given point of the Brillouin zone.
In fact, this method is \emph{semi-empirical} since it borrows all necessary parameters
from the experiment. To calculate the dispersion curves, there is no need to know the wave
functions; their knowledge becomes necessary when one needs to calculate the matrix elements
of optical transitions and the character of their optical polarization.

A detailed comparison of predictions obtained using the first-principles calculations and
the ${\bf k \cdot p}$ method showed that in respect to low-dimensional structures (they
will be the subject of our further research), the predictions of the ${\bf k} \cdot {\bf p}$
method are characterized by a large number of shortcomings described and analyzed in detail
in Refs.~\cite{PhysRevB.53.7949,PhysRevB.57.9971,ElectrochemSocProc.98-19.259,
JPhysChemB.102.6449,PhysRevB.54.11417}. First of all, these are errors in the prediction of
energies of all subbands except for those that were used as empirical parameters; overestimation
of the size effect; impossibility to predict \emph{a full set} of subbands in the conduction
band~\cite{PhysRevB.53.7949,PhysRevB.57.9971} as well in the valence
band~\cite{JPhysChemB.102.6449}, and to describe optical transitions involving all subbands
of the conduction band~\cite{JPhysChemB.102.6449}. The main cause of these errors is the
insufficient number of bands taken into account in the calculations, which leads to
significant errors in description of dispersion curves. A basis of eight (including spin)
bands is the most commonly used in these calculations. At the same time, as was shown in
Ref.~\cite{PhysRevB.54.11417}, it is necessary to take at least 30 bands (including spin)
into account for a qualitative description of the band dispersion in GaAs, and its
quantitative description requires about 150 bands. When modeling the low-dimensional
structures within the ${\bf k \cdot p}$ method, one more problem arises: their description
in the envelope function approximation, which is based on the assumption of smoothness of
this function, is formally impossible due to the appearance the Fourier component of the
potential that goes beyond the first Brillouin zone. Additional difficulties arise
when modeling heterostructures with a strong lattice mismatch. These problems are absent
in the first-principles calculations.

The aim of this work was to develop an approach to analyzing the spinor wave functions
that would allow one to determine the genesis of various bands in low-dimensional
structures. The problem is that due to the size quantization effects and strong
mixing of different branches of the electronic spectrum, the identification of
electronic states in the valence band of these structures becomes extremely
complicated. Since optical transitions that take into account their polarization are
determined by the total angular momentum $j$ and magnetic quantum number $m_j$ in the
initial and final states, it becomes necessary to determine the contributions of states
with different~$(j,~m_j)$ to the initial and final states. The available programs for
an analysis of spinor wave functions (see~\cite{ComputPhysCommun.272.108226} and the
references therein) are usually limited to determining the symmetry of the wave
functions; this is absolutely insufficient for determining the genesis and identifying
bands.

Cadmium selenide CdSe was chosen as an object on which the proposed approach will be
tested as it is a direct-gap semiconductor and has interesting optical properties.
A considerable interest in CdSe now is associated with the study of nanoparticles of
various shapes made of this
material~\cite{NanocrystalQuantumDots,Materials.3.2260,ChemRev.2c00436}.

In the bulk form, cadmium selenide usually crystallizes in the wurtzite hexagonal structure
(space group $P6_3mc = C_{6v}^4$) while its cubic phase with the zinc-blende structure
(space group $F{\bar 4}3m = T_d^2$) is metastable. However, under certain synthesis
conditions, samples can be obtained in the zinc-blende structure. In particular, nanocrystals
obtained by chemical route at low temperatures often have this structure.

Calculations of the electronic structure of cubic CdSe and its optical properties in a wide
energy range were carried out using OPW, LCAO, empirical pseudopotential, and FP-LAPW
methods~\cite{PhysRev.179.740,PhysRevB.47.9449,PhysRevB.49.7262,JChemPhys.124.104707,
JAlloysComp.509.6737}. The ${\bf k} \cdot {\bf p}$ method was used to calculate the
electronic structure and optical matrix elements in CdSe
nanoplatelets~\cite{NatureMater.10.936,PhysRevB.95.165414,JApplPhys.119.143107}.


\section{Calculation technique}

Calculations of the electronic structure of bulk CdSe with the zinc-blende structure
with taking the spin-orbit interaction into account were carried out from first principles
within the density-functional theory using the ABINIT program~\cite{abinit3}. The local
density approximation (LDA) and PAW pseudopotentials~\cite{ComputMaterSci.81.446} were
used in the calculations. The plane wave cutoff energy was 30~Ha (816~eV). The unit cell
parameters and atomic positions were relaxed until the forces acting on the atoms became
less than $5 \cdot 10^{-6}$~Ha/Bohr (0.25~meV/{\AA}) while the accuracy of the total energy
calculation was better than 10$^{-10}$~Ha. A number of calculations were also performed
using the HGH pseudopotentials~\cite{PhysRevB.58.3641} with a cutoff energy of 60~Ha and
the ONCVPSP ones~\cite{PhysRevB.88.085117} with a cutoff energy of 50~Ha.

In real low-dimensional structures---superlattices, nanoplatelets, and
nanoheterostructures grown in the [001] direction---the layers are strained, and so
their symmetry is tetragonal or lower. This is why we consider CdSe as an active
region of such structures and study the properties of CdSe biaxially stretched and
biaxially compressed in the $xy$ plane.

Since the spin-orbit interaction practically does not affect the geometry of structures,
the calculations of the equilibrium geometry were carried out without taking spin into
account. The band energies and spinor wave functions in the obtained structures were
calculated with the spin-orbit interaction turned on. To output the values of the matrix
elements of the momentum operator, small changes were added into the code of the ABINIT
program. To unambiguously separate optical transitions from the light holes and of split-off
holes to the conduction band in $\sigma$ and $\pi$ polarizations, a magnetic field was
applied parallel to the $z$~axis of the sample. The possibility of such calculations was
recently added into the program~\cite{PhysRevB.99.184404}. Since these calculations in
the ABINIT program are implemented only for norm-conserving pseudopotentials, the HGH and
ONCVPSP pseudopotentials were used in these calculations.

Using two components of the new approach, namely, (1) tracing the changes in the
energies of bands upon the ``adiabatic'' turning on the spin-orbit interaction and
(2) determining the genesis of the spinor wave functions by expanding their angular
parts in terms of irreducible representations of the point group, it becomes possible
to identify the bands, trace their evolution, and determine the degree of mixing of
various electronic states in them and their symmetry. As far as the author knows,
this approach to an analysis of the spinor wave functions have not been used before.

Since CdSe is a direct-gap semiconductor with the band extrema at the $\Gamma$~point of
the Brillouin zone, we will be interested in optical transitions exactly at this point
when analyzing its optical properties. Upon a tetragonal distortion of the structure along
the $z$~axis, the FCC Bravais lattice transforms into a body-centered tetragonal Bravais
lattice whose translation vectors are rotated by 45$^\circ$ in the~$xy$ plane with respect
to the axes of the FCC lattice. Therefore, the directions of the $\Delta$ and $\Sigma$
axes in the Brillouin zone are also interchanged with respect to their directions in the
cubic structure.


\section{Group-theoretical background}

As will be shown in Sec.~\ref{sec41}, the valence band of cubic CdSe is mainly composed
of the $p$ orbitals
of Se (orbital angular momentum $l = 1$). They will be denoted by $|X \rangle$, $|Y \rangle$,
and $|Z \rangle$. Without taking the spin-orbit interaction into account, the valence band
at the $\Gamma$~point is threefold degenerate and is described by a vector irreducible
representation $T_2$~\cite{AltmannHerzig} ($F_2$ according to Bir and Pikus~\cite{BirPikus1972-transl}).
When moving away from the $\Gamma$~point, these bands split into a nondegenerate band of
light carriers (with magnetic quantum number $m = 0$) and a doubly degenerate band of
heavy carriers (with $m = \pm 1$). As will be shown below, the conduction band originates
from the $s$~states of Se and Cd atoms ($l = 0)$, is nondegenerate, and has a symmetry of
$A_1$ ($\Gamma_1$).

When the spin-orbit interaction is turned on, the symmetry of wave functions is described by the
irreducible representations of the double group in which the operations of the $T_d$ point group
are supplemented by the transformations of the spin variable. In contrast to five irreducible
representations of the $T_d$ point group at the $\Gamma$~point, there are three irreducible
representations in the double group~\cite{AltmannHerzig}. They are direct products of
representations of the point group and the ${\cal D}_{1/2}$ representation of the rotation
group for particles with spin~1/2. In particular, $\Gamma_6 = {\cal D}_{1/2} \otimes A_1$,
and the direct product ${\cal D}_{1/2} \otimes T_2$ is reducible and splits into the sum
$\Gamma_8 \oplus \Gamma_7$.

Spin-orbit interaction causes a complex mixing of $|X \rangle$, $|Y \rangle$, and $|Z \rangle$
orbitals and results in the lifting of the threefold degeneracy of the valence bands at the
$\Gamma$~point; the bands are split according to their total angular momentum~$j$. The heavy
holes HH ($j = 3/2$, $m_j = \pm 3/2$) and light holes LH ($j = 3/2$, $m_j = \pm 1/2$), which
originate genetically from the doubly degenerate band of heavy carriers with $m = \pm 1$, are
shifted upwards, and the split-off SO band ($j = 1/2$, $m_j = \pm 1/2$) arising from the
nondegenerate band of light carriers with $m = 0$ shifts downwards. The symmetry of the LH
and HH bands which are doubly degenerate at the $\Gamma$~point is described by the $\Gamma_8$
irreducible representation of the double group, the symmetry of the SO band is described
by the $\Gamma_7$ representation, and that of the conduction band is described by the
$\Gamma_6$ representation.

The wave functions of the conduction and three valence bands at the $\Gamma$~point in a cubic
crystal have the form~\cite{PhysRev.97.869,PhysRev.100.580,JPhysChemSolids.1.249}:
\begin{widetext}
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{gathered}
    \phi_{c1} = | iS \!\downarrow\rangle;~~\phi_{c2} = | iS \!\uparrow\rangle;~~\phi_{hh1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} | (X + iY) \!\uparrow\rangle;~~\phi_{hh2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} | (X - iY) \!\downarrow\rangle; \\
    \phi_{lh1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} | (X - iY) \!\uparrow\rangle + \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\, | Z \!\downarrow\rangle;~~\phi_{lh2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{6}} | (-X + iY) \!\downarrow\rangle + \sqrt{\frac{2}{3}}\, | Z \!\uparrow\rangle; \\
    \phi_{so1} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} | (X - iY) \!\uparrow\rangle - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} | Z \!\downarrow\rangle;~~\phi_{so2} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} | (-X + iY) \!\downarrow\rangle - \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} | Z \!\uparrow\rangle
    \end{gathered}
    \label{eq1}
    \end{equation}
\end{widetext}
(when choosing the coefficients, we follow the paper~\cite{JPhysChemSolids.1.249}). When
moving away from the $\Gamma$~point, the degeneracy of the LH and HH bands is lifted and
their mixing occurs.

Biaxial compression or tension of the crystals in the (001) plane lowers their symmetry
to $I{\bar 4}m2$ ($D_{2d}^9$) and results in a significant change of their electronic
structure. From the group-theoretical point of view, when the symmetry of a crystal is
reduced to $D_{2d}$, the number of irreducible representations at the $\Gamma$~point of
the point group remain the same (five), but their number in the double group is reduced
to two ($\Gamma_6$ and $\Gamma_7$)~\cite{AltmannHerzig}. The vector representation $T_2$
of the point group of the cubic structure becomes reducible: $T_2 \to B_2 \oplus E$.
Representations of the double group  in the tetragonal structure are obtained as follows:
$\Gamma_6 = {\cal D}_{1/2} \otimes A_1$ (conduction band),
$\Gamma_7 = {\cal D}_{1/2} \otimes B_2$ (SO band). Direct product ${\cal D}_{1/2} \otimes E$
(light and heavy holes) turns out to be reducible and decomposes into the sum
$\Gamma_6 \oplus \Gamma_7$. For odd spinor functions originating from $p$ atomic orbitals,
the $\Gamma_6$ symmetry indicates the heavy holes, and the $\Gamma_7$ one indicates the
light holes~\cite{AltmannHerzig}. The reducibility of the representation means that under
a tetragonal distortion, the degeneracy of the HH and LH bands is lifted at the
$\Gamma$~point ($\Gamma_8 \to \Gamma_6 \oplus \Gamma_7$). The fact that the states of
the LH and SO bands in a strained crystal are described by the same representation
($\Gamma_7$) indicates the possibility of their mixing.

Below, when analyzing the symmetry of spinor wave functions, we will use the projection
analysis to determine the expansion coefficients of the angular parts of wave functions
in an orthogonal basis of irreducible representations of the point group. In a cubic
crystal, all 4th order axes are equivalent, and the projection analysis does not allow
to resolve the contributions of bands with different~$m$ at the $\Gamma$~point. Under
a tetragonal strain ($F{\bar 4}3m \to I{\bar 4}m2$), the $z$~direction becomes
distinguished, the degeneracy of the $m = 0$ and $m = \pm 1$ states is lifted,
and unambiguous determination of the fraction of $|Z \rangle$ states in the LH and SO
bands of the~$\Gamma_7$ symmetry using the projection analysis becomes possible. This
turns out to be very important for determining the matrix elements of optical transitions.

While in a cubic semiconductor, in accordance with Eq.~(\ref{eq1}), the contributions
of the $|X \rangle$, $|Y \rangle$, and $|Z \rangle$ orbitals to the SO band are the same
(this is a kind of a ``cubic reference point'' that arises from the equivalence of three
directions of a cube), under a tetragonal distortion the $|X \pm iY \rangle$ and
$|Z \rangle$ states become independent. As will be shown below, the projection analysis
finds a strong change in proportions of these states in a strained structure, and since it
significantly affects the matrix elements of optical transitions, this makes it possible
to change the absorption and luminescence spectra of a semiconductor using the elastic
strain.

We note that until now the discussion of the strain effects on the electronic structure
of the valence band within the ${\bf k} \cdot {\bf p}$ method was usually limited to
consideration of the band energies and their
dispersions~\cite{BirPikus1972-transl,VoonWillatzen,PhysicsOptoelectronicDevices}. One
of a few papers that has discussed the changes in the wave functions and matrix elements of
optical transitions in strained crystals with zinc-blende structure, was the
paper~\cite{IEEEJQuantElectron.29.1344}.


\section{Results and their discussion}

\subsection{Determination of symmetry and genesis of spinor wave functions}
\label{sec41}

We have already noted that the symmetry of the spinor wave functions at the $\Gamma$~point
in tetragonal structures can be either $\Gamma_6$ or $\Gamma_7$. Determination of the
symmetry of wave functions and their genesis proved to be not an easy task. The fact is
that in programs for electronic structure calculations, only the spatial symmetry of wave
functions (given by the point group) is taken into account. This is because in the double
group there is always the ${\bar E}$ operator, which corresponds to a rotation of a crystal
by 360$^\circ$ and changes the sign of the wave function to opposite. So, if the spin
variable were taken into account, then the resulting wave function would always be
identically equal to zero.

To find the double group representation that describes the symmetry of a given wave
function, we analyzed the symmetry of each of its spinor components for ${\bf k} = 0$
averaged in the~$xy$ plane with respect to reflections in the plane passing through the
cadmium atom. The components of the wave functions were extracted from the array of wave
functions using the \texttt{cut3d} program included into the ABINIT software package.
Although the
$I{\bar 4}m2$ space group does not contain the indicated symmetry operation, the improper
rotation~$S_4$ creates such an operation for the plane-averaged wave function. Even functions
correspond to the $\Gamma_6$~symmetry, odd functions correspond to the $\Gamma_7$ one. The
obtained symmetries of wave functions were confirmed later by calculations of the matrix
elements of optical transitions between the valence subbands and the conduction band; they
completely agree with the results obtained using the \texttt{IrRep} program~\cite{ComputPhysCommun.272.108226}.

As noted above, the existence of only two double group representations means that they
can arise from a superposition of four different states: light, heavy, split-off holes,
and $s$-like states of the conduction band in the initial cubic crystal. To determine the
genesis of spinor wave functions, the symmetry of both components of the spinor wave
function~$\psi$ for each band was analyzed in respect to all operations~$g$ of the point
group $G = D_{2d}$. The desired parameters were the values
    \begin{equation}
    F(g) = \frac{\| g \psi + \psi \|^2 - \| g \psi - \psi \|^2}{4 \| \psi \|^2},
    \label{eq2}
    \end{equation}
which were then decomposed using the character table in an orthogonal basis of irreducible
representations of the $D_{2d}$ point group. The decomposition coefficients
    \begin{equation}
    a_i = \frac{1}{| G |} \sum_{g \in G} \chi_i(g) \nu_i F(g),
    \end{equation}
where $| G |$ is the number of elements in the group, and $\chi_i$ is the character of
the $i$th representation, determine the contributions of different representations to the
analyzed wave function. The factor $\nu_i$ corrects the scalar product~(\ref{eq2}) for
the dimension of the $i$th representation. When performing the analysis, it turned out to
be important to choose the position of the reference point in the unit cell in such a way
that it coincided with one of the points of high symmetry; in our calculations, it was the
$2(a)$ Wyckoff position. To avoid the problem arising from the degeneracy of components of the
spinor wave function at ${\bf k} = 0$, the analysis was performed for the wave vector shifted
along the $\Sigma$~axis from the $\Gamma$~point to a distance of about 0.0005~{\AA}$^{-1}$.%
    \footnote{Due to the absence of an inversion center in crystals with the
    $D_{2d}^9$ space group, the spinor wave functions are described by two independent components
    at all points of the Brillouin zone except for the $\Gamma$, $X$, $M$ points and the
    points on the~$\Lambda$ axis.}
As expected, the $A_1$, $B_2$, and $E$ representations appeared in the projections; the
projections onto $A_2$ and $B_1$ irreducible representations were absent.

An analysis of the projections of the obtained spinor wave functions onto atoms shows that
the conduction band of CdSe is composed of 56\% of $s$~orbitals of Se atoms and 44\% of
$s$~orbitals of Cd atoms. The states in the valence band are formed mainly from $p$~orbitals
of Se with an admixture of about 7\% of $d$~states of Cd and 2\% $p$~states of Cd and
therefore, according to their genesis, can be classified as light, heavy, and split-off holes.
The main problem in interpreting these bands is how to distinguish between light and heavy holes
whose projections onto irreducible representations of the point group have the same symmetry ($E$).
Since the spin-orbit interaction lifts the twofold degeneracy of the $E$~level, it is possible,
by tracing the change in energies of levels at adiabatic turning on the spin-orbit interaction,%
    \footnote{Such calculations can be performed in the ABINIT program, in which the portion
    of the spin-orbit interaction energy used in the calculations with PAW pseudopotentials,
    $\lambda_{\rm SO}$, is controlled by the \texttt{spnorbscl} variable.}
and by taking the previously obtained symmetry of bands ($\Gamma_6$ or $\Gamma_7$) into
account, to unambiguously identify the LH and HH subbands (Fig.~\ref{fig1}). As for the
SO subband, it does not exhibit splitting at turning on the spin-orbit interaction. An
additional argument in the analysis can be that the projections of LH and SO bands are
always a mixture of $B_2$ and $E$ states because of the strong admixture of $|Z \rangle$
states to wave functions (see Eq.~(\ref{eq1})), whereas the HH band has a pure $E$~symmetry.

An analysis of the projections of spinor wave functions onto irreducible representations
of the point group shows that the symmetry of the conduction band (CB) in CdSe is closest
to the $s$ type: the angular part of its wave function $\Gamma_6$ is projected onto the
$A_1$ representation; the admixture of contributions of other symmetries does not exceed
0.1\%. The angular part of the wave functions of HH band with the $\Gamma_6$ symmetry is
projected onto the $E$~representation; an admixture of wave functions of other symmetries
does not exceed 0.1--0.2\%. Despite the same symmetry of the CB and HH bands, they have
different parity with respect to the inversion and, therefore, they do not mix at the
$\Gamma$~point (their mixing becomes possible at ${\bf k} \ne 0$). As expected, the
strongest mixing effects at the $\Gamma$~point are observed for the LH and SO bands, which
have the same $\Gamma_7$ symmetry. In summary, the first-principles calculations confirm
the adequacy of assumptions underlying the Luttinger--Kohn valence band model~\cite{PhysRev.97.869}.

The evolution of the energies of various branches of the valence band upon the adiabatic
turning on the spin-orbit interaction in biaxially compressed and biaxially stretched
CdSe crystals is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig1}. When the spin-orbit interaction is turned off
($\lambda_{\rm SO} = 0$), there is already a splitting of bands caused by strain in crystals.
When the spin-orbit interaction is turned on, the sequence of bands in a biaxially compressed
sample corresponds to its usual order (the upper subband is the heavy holes one, the
following subband is the light holes band, and the lowest subband is the split-off band).
In biaxially stretched samples, the situation is more interesting. As follows from the
figure, the upper energy band (denoted as LH) is genetically derived from the band of
the $B_2$~symmetry with $m = 0$, which generates states with a total angular momentum
$j = 1/2$ when the spin-orbit interaction is turned on. This is evidenced by the absence
of splitting. When the $\lambda_{\rm SO}$ is increased, the fraction of the $| Z\rangle$
states in wave functions of a stretched sample decreases systematically but non-linearly,
i.e. the mixing of the $j = 1/2$ and $j = 3/2$ states appears already at ${\bf k} = 0$
(the symmetry of the $D_{2d}$ group allows such mixing~\cite{AltmannHerzig}). A decrease
in the fraction of the $j = 1/2, m_j = \pm 1/2$ states in the LH subband from 100\% to
75\% indicates that theses states give the dominant contribution into this $\Gamma_7$ band.
This is a little bit surprising because the light holes are commonly associated with
the $j = 3/2, m_j = \pm 1/2$ states. On the contrary, the lowest band (denoted as SO),
which genetically arises from the splitting of a doubly degenerate $E$~band when the
spin-orbit interaction is turned on, indicates its initial total angular momentum
$j = 3/2$. As a result of mixing, at $\lambda_{\rm SO} = 1$, this $\Gamma_7$ symmetry
band preserves the predominant fraction (75\%) of the $j = 3/2, m_j = \pm 1/2$ states,
which is also surprising.

The changes in positions of the valence subbands at ${\bf k} = 0$ as a function of strain
are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig2}. It is seen that without the spin-orbit interaction (thin
black lines) a tetragonal strain always results in splitting of states with $m = \pm 1$
and $m = 0$ (as noted above, the latter state is a predecessor of the split-off
band). When the spin-orbit interaction is turned on, the heavy holes band ($\Gamma_6$)
exhibits a parallel upward shift while the two remaining $\Gamma_7$ bands undergo a
complex interaction and mixing. The latter is evidenced by the observation of an
anticrossing pattern characteristic of interacting bands with a minimum gap between the
bands at a strain of $\approx -1.37$\%.

The fraction of $|Z \rangle$ states in wave functions of the SO band as a function of
biaxial strain is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig3}. It is seen that the contribution of the
$|Z \rangle$ states into this band rapidly increases when the samples are compressed
and rapidly decreases when the samples are stretched. As follows from the figure, this
behavior is general for semiconductors with the zinc-blende structure. According to the
results of analytical calculations carried out in Ref.~\cite{IEEEJQuantElectron.29.1344}
within the Kane model, the fraction of $|Z \rangle$ states in the wave functions of this
band is described by the equation
    \begin{equation}
    f_z = \frac{1}{2} \Big(1 - \frac{\Delta - 3S}{\sqrt{9\Delta^2 - 6S \Delta + 9S^2}}\Big),
    \label{eq4}
    \end{equation}
where $S$ is the strain-induced splitting of the subbands of light and heavy carriers
(without the spin-orbit interaction) and $\Delta$ is the energy of spin-orbit splitting.
The calculated dependence for CdSe is shown by a dashed line in Fig.~\ref{fig3}; a
qualitative agreement between the results of first-principles calculations and the
predictions of the cited work is observed. The width of the transition region does indeed
change approximately proportional to the strength of the spin-orbit interactions. Note
that the minimum gap between the LH and SO subbands falls on the strain value of
$\approx -1.37$\%, at which the mixing of states in the indicated bands is maximal
(in proportion 1:1).


\subsection{Matrix elements of optical transitions}

The group theory states that for optical transitions to be allowed in the dipole
approximation, the direct product of representations of groups describing the initial and
final states should contain at least one vector representation. For the $D_{2d}$ group
we have
$\Gamma_6 \otimes \Gamma_6 = A_1 \oplus A_2 \oplus E$, $\Gamma_6 \otimes \Gamma_7 = B_1 \oplus B_2 \oplus E$,
$\Gamma_7 \otimes \Gamma_7 = A_1 \oplus A_2 \oplus E$~\cite{AltmannHerzig}.
This means that in the crystals under discussion, the $\Gamma_6$--$\Gamma_7$ optical
transitions are allowed in both ($\sigma$ and $\pi$) polarizations, whereas the
$\Gamma_6$--$\Gamma_6$ and $\Gamma_7$--$\Gamma_7$ transitions are allowed only in the
$\sigma$~polarization, in which the electric field vector lies in the~$xy$ plane.

By examining the scheme of possible optical transitions (Fig.~\ref{fig4}), one can see that
the only possible transition between the HH and CB bands is a transition in the $\sigma$
polarization with a change of projection of the total angular momentum of $\Delta m_j = \pm 1$.
The transition with $\Delta m_j = \pm 2$ is forbidden in the dipole approximation, and the
transition between the bands in the $\pi$ polarization ($\Delta m_j = 0$) are impossible
because of the lack of a suitable final state in the conduction band.

For the LH$\to$CB and SO$\to$CB transitions, the identification of transitions is complicated
by the equality $|m_j| = 1/2$ for all involved states and the spin degeneracy of them at
${\bf k} = 0$. Although the
transitions in $\sigma$ and $\pi$ polarizations can be distinguished by the values of matrix
elements of the momentum operator $|P_x|^2$ and $|P_z|^2$,%
    \footnote{To do this, we need a tetragonal strain; without it, the matrix elements in
    all polarizations are the same (cubic symmetry).}
the spin degeneracy results in a mixing of wave functions with $m_j = 1/2$ and $m_j = -1/2$
and does not allow unambiguous identification of all transitions. For their unambiguous
identification, we used a trick with the imposition of an external magnetic field, which
removes the degeneracy of these levels due to the Zeeman splitting. This allowed us to
solve our problem. The only unresolved question was that the sign of the $g$~factor in the
Zeeman splitting remains unknown. If we take its sign to be positive for electrons, then
the same sign applies for heavy holes, but the signs for other two bands are opposite to
each other and depend on the strain. At a strain close to zero, the sign of the $g$~factor
for the SO band is positive while for the LH band it is negative. However, under strong
biaxial compression, the signs of $g$~factors for these bands are reversed. Curiously, the
change in signs of $g$~factors for these two bands occurs at approximately the same strain
at which the contributions of the $| Z \rangle$ states into the bands become equal. The
results obtained with imposition of a magnetic field for the HGH pseudopotentials were
completely confirmed by calculations with norm-conserving ONCVPSP pseudopotentials~\cite{PhysRevB.88.085117}
(we note that in the used version of the ABINIT program (8.10.3) such calculations are
possible only for full-relativistic LDA pseudopotentials). The spin-resolved selection
rules obtained within the described approach are in full agreement with the group-theoretical
predictions.

The squares of the matrix elements of individual transitions in CdSe as a function of
strain are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig5}. At zero strain, the probabilities of individual
transitions completely correspond to the probabilities expected for cubic
crystals~\cite{OpticalOrientation}. At non-zero strain, the probabilities of the
LH$\to$CB and SO$\to$CB transitions are determined by the partial fractions of the
$| X \rangle$, $| Y \rangle$, and $| Z \rangle$ states in the initial state, although
these dependences are not exactly linear. The probability of transitions in the
$\pi$ polarization correlates with the fraction of $| Z \rangle$ states in the wave
function, and that for transitions in the $\sigma$ polarization correlates with the
fraction of $| X \pm iY \rangle$ states in the wave function. It is interesting that
despite strong changes in partial fractions of $|X \pm iY \rangle$ and $|Z \rangle$
states in the wave functions, the total intensity of the LH+SO$\to$CB transitions as well
as of the HH$\to$CB one changes by no more than 3.5--4\% over the entire strain range.
These are only the intensities of individual components that are changed.

It is of interest to compare the obtained results with those obtained using the
${\bf k \cdot p}$ method. Unfortunately, no similar calculations were found for bulk
CdSe, however, there are many publications devoted to similar calculations for cubic
gallium nitride.

The results qualitatively consistent with ours were obtained in calculations of the matrix
elements of HH$\to$CB and LH$\to$CB optical transitions in biaxially compressed and biaxially
stretched GaN using the ${\bf k \cdot p}$ method~\cite{JKoreanPhysSoc.34.S386}.

On the other hand, similar calculations were carried out in Ref.~\cite{JApplPhys.80.3471}
for multiple quantum wells from zinc-blende GaN biaxially compressed by 0.5\% because of
a contact with wide-gap AlGaN layers. According to the authors' calculations, heavy holes
make the main contribution to optical transitions in the $\sigma$ polarization, and the
total contribution of the LH and SO subbands are 6~times smaller. In the $\pi$ polarization,
the total contribution of the LH and SO subbands is approximately 2/3 of the contribution
of heavy holes in the $\sigma$ polarizations. The first question that arises is why the
LH and SO bands are considered together. According to our calculations, at a biaxial
strain of $-$0.5\% the splitting of these bands reaches 49~meV, and they must certainly
be considered separately. Moreover, our calculations of the matrix elements of the
momentum operator for GaN subjected to the above strain give completely different
relationships between the matrix elements. For example, the matrix elements of the
HH$\to$CB and LH$\to$CB transitions in the $\sigma$ polarization differs by only 1\%
while the SO$\to$CB transitions in the $\pi$ polarization should have approximately twice
higher probability.

When calculating the matrix elements of the momentum operator, we observed that their
values obtained using different functionals can differ markedly. For example, the value of
the $|P_x|^2$ matrix element for HH$\to$CB transitions is 9.9~eV for PAW pseudopotentials,
14.9~eV for ONCVPSP pseudopotentials, and 20.8~eV for HGH pseudopotentials. A comparison
showed that the wave functions are sufficiently close to each other for HGH and ONCVPSP
pseudopotentials, whereas for PAW pseudopotentials they contain a strong background near
the nuclei for the conduction band states. The value closest to the Kane energy used in
the literature for CdSe (16.5~eV~\cite{NatureMater.10.936}) is obtained using the ONCVPSP
pseudopotentials.


\section{Conclusions}

An approach to analyzing the spinor wave functions that appear in the electronic
structure calculations when taking the spin-orbit interaction into account is developed.
It is based on the projection analysis of angular parts of wave functions onto
irreducible representations of the point group and analysis of the evolution of
the energy levels upon the adiabatic turning on the spin-orbit interaction. This
approach makes it possible to determine the genesis of the spinor wave functions,
calculate the fractions of different contributions to the mixing of these states,
and thus unambiguously identify electronic states. It seems promising to further use
this approach to identify electronic states in low-dimensional systems such as
superlattices, nanoplatelets, and nanoheterostructures, in which the valence band
states are strongly mixed, and their unambiguous identification is complicated by
the appearance of a large number of minibands as a result of the size quantization.
