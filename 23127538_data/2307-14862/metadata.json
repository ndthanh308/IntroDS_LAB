  "abstract": "We investigate realistic models of compact objects, focusing on neutron and strange stars, composed by dense matter and dark energy in the form of a simple fluid or scalar field interacting with matter. For the dark energy component, we use equations of state compatible with cosmological observations. This requirement strongly constrains possible deviations from the simple $Λ$-Cold Dark-Matter model with EoS $p_{d}=-ρ_{d}$ at least for small densities of the dark component. But we can propose that the density of dark energy interacting with matter can reach large values in relativistic stars and affects the star parameters such as the mass and radius. Simple models of dark energy are considered. Then we investigated possible effects from modified gravity choosing to study the $R^2$ model combined with dark energy. Finally, the case of dark energy as scalar field non-minimally interacting with gravity is considered.",
