  "abstract": "In this paper we consider systems which consist of binary components with known reliabilities. We discuss their algebraic properties and define the corresponding algebraic structure, which we call the reliability algebra. We prove that the reliability algebra is a Boolean algebra. The reliability algebra seems an appropriate context for defining fuzziness measure i.e. membership function with reliability values.",
