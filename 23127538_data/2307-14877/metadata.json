  "abstract": "We examine the metric and Einstein bilinear functionals of differential forms introduced in Adv.Math.,Vol.427,(2023)1091286, for Hodge-Dirac operator $d+δ$ on an oriented even-dimensional Riemannian manifold. We show that they reproduce these functionals for the canonical Dirac operator on a spin manifold up to a numerical factor. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the associated spectral triple is spectrally closed, which implies that it is torsion-free.",
