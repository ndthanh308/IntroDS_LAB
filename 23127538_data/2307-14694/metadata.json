  "abstract": "The importance of post-CCSD(T) corrections as high as CCSDTQ56 for ground-state spectroscopic constants ($D_e$, $ω_e$, $ω_ex_e$, and $α_e$) has been surveyed for a sample of two dozen mostly heavy-atom diatomics spanning a broad range of static correlation strength. While CCSD(T) is known to be an unusually felicitous `Pauling point' between accuracy and computational cost, performance leaves something to be desired for molecules with strong static correlation. We find CCSDT(Q)$_Λ$ to be the next `sweet spot' up, of comparable or superior quality to the much more expensive CCSDTQ. A similar comparison applies to CCSDTQ(5)$_Λ$ vs. CCSDTQ5, while CCSDTQ5(6)$_Λ$ is essentially indistinguishable from CCSDTQ56. A composite of CCSD(T)-X2C/ACV5Z-X2C with [CCSDT(Q)$_Λ$ -- CCSD(T)]/cc-pVTZ or even cc-pVDZ basis sets appears highly effective for computational vibrational spectroscopy. Unlike CCSDT(Q) which breaks down for the ozone vibrational frequencies, CCSDT(Q)$_Λ$ handles them gracefully.",
