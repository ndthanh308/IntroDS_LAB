@article{X2C,
abstract = {Two routes for deriving the exact two-component Hamiltonians are compared. In the first case, as already known, we start directly from the matrix representation of the Dirac operator in a restricted kinetically balanced basis and make a single block diagonalization. In the second case, not considered before, we start instead from the Foldy–Wouthuysen operator and make proper use of resolutions of the identity. The expressions are surprisingly different. It turns out that a mistake was made in the former formulation when going from the Dirac to the Schr{\"{o}}dinger picture. The two formulations become equivalent after the mistake is corrected.},

@article{Tyuterev2013,
abstract = {An accurate description of the complicated shape of the potential energy surface (PES) and that of the highly excited vibration states is of crucial importance for various unsolved issues in the spectroscopy and dynamics of ozone and remains a challenge for the theory. In this work a new analytical representation is proposed for the PES of the ground electronic state of the ozone molecule in the range covering the main potential well and the transition state towards the dissociation. This model accounts for particular features specific to the ozone PES for large variations of nuclear displacements along the minimum energy path. The impact of the shape of the PES near the transition state (existence of the "reef structure") on vibration energy levels was studied for the first time. The major purpose of this work was to provide accurate theoretical predictions for ozone vibrational band centres at the energy range near the dissociation threshold, which would be helpful for understanding the very complicated high-resolution spectra and its analyses currently in progress. Extended ab initio electronic structure calculations were carried out enabling the determination of the parameters of a minimum energy path PES model resulting in a new set of theoretical vibrational levels of ozone. A comparison with recent high-resolution spectroscopic data on the vibrational levels gives the root-mean-square deviations below 1 cm-1 for ozone band centres up to 90\% of the dissociation energy. New ab initio vibrational predictions represent a significant improvement with respect to all previously available calculations. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

A detailed discussion is devoted to the accuracy of parameter determination for each of four steps of calculations.

This approach is entirely independent of experimental data and contains no empirical scaling factors, and includes a treatment of electron correlation up to the full coupled-cluster singles, doubles, triples and quadruples approach. Energies are further augmented by anharmonic zero-point vibrational energies, a scalar relativistic correction, first-order spin-orbit coupling, and the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer correction. The accuracy of the approach is assessed by several means. Enthalpies of formation (at 0 K) calculated for a test suite of 31 atoms and molecules via direct calculation of the corresponding elemental formation reactions are within 1 kJ mol(-1) to experiment in all cases. Given the quite different bonding environments in the product and reactant sides of these reactions, the results strongly indicate that even greater accuracy may be expected in reactions that preserve (either exactly or approximately) the number and types of chemical bonds.},

abstract = {The recently developed high-accuracy extrapolated ab initio thermochemistry method for theoretical thermochemistry, which is intimately related to other high-precision protocols such as the Weizmann-3 and focal-point approaches, is revisited. Some minor improvements in theoretical rigor are introduced which do not lead to any significant additional computational overhead, but are shown to have a negligible overall effect on the accuracy. In addition, the method is extended to completely treat electron correlation effects up to pentuple excitations. The use of an approximate treatment of quadruple and pentuple excitations is suggested; the former as a pragmatic approximation for standard cases and the latter when extremely high accuracy is required. For a test suite of molecules that have rather precisely known enthalpies of formation {as taken from the active thermochemical tables of Ruscic and co-workers [Lecture Notes in Computer Science, edited by M. Parashar (Springer, Berlin, 2002), Vol. 2536, pp. 25-38; J. Phys. Chem. A 108, 9979 (2004)]}, the largest deviations between theory and experiment are 0.52, -0.70, and 0.51 kJ mol(-1) for the latter three methods, respectively. Some perspective is provided on this level of accuracy, and sources of remaining systematic deficiencies in the approaches are discussed.},

abstract = {Effects of increased basis-set size as well as a correlated treatment of the diagonal Born-Oppenheimer approximation are studied within the context of the high-accuracy extrapolated ab initio thermochemistry (HEAT) theoretical model chemistry. It is found that the addition of these ostensible improvements does little to increase the overall accuracy of HEAT for the determination of molecular atomization energies. Fortuitous cancellation of high-level effects is shown to give the overall HEAT strategy an accuracy that is, in fact, higher than most of its individual components. In addition, the issue of core-valence electron correlation separation is explored; it is found that approximate additive treatments of the two effects have limitations that are significant in the realm of <1 kJ mol(-1) theoretical thermochemistry.},

@article{Ruden2004,
abstract = {Using the coupled-cluster method, we have examined the contributions from the connected quadruple and quintuple virtual excitations to the harmonic vibrational frequencies and equilibrium bond distances of HF, N(2), F(2), and CO. Whereas the largest quadruples contributions are -18.8 cm(-1) to the harmonic frequency of N(2) and 0.43 pm to the bond distance of F(2), the largest quintuples contributions are -3.9 cm(-1) to the harmonic frequency of N(2) and 0.03 pm to the bond distances of N(2) and F(2). As we improve the description by going from the coupled-cluster singles-and-doubles model with a perturbative triples correction [CCSD(T)] to the coupled-cluster singles-doubles-triples-and-quadruples model, the mean and maximum absolute errors in the calculated frequencies relative to experiment are reduced from 11.3 and 15.8 cm(-1), respectively, to 3.2 and 4.7 cm(-1); for the bond distances, the mean and maximum absolute errors are reduced from 0.16 and 0.47 pm, respectively, to 0.04 and 0.13 pm. The calculations presented here confirm previous observations that, to some extent, the relatively small errors in the CCSD(T) equilibrium bond distances and harmonic frequencies arise from a cancellation of errors in the approximate (perturbative) treatment of the connected triples and the neglect of higher-order connected excitations. Further inclusion of quintuples contributions, relativistic corrections, and adiabatic corrections reduces the mean and maximum absolute errors to 1.1 and 2.3 cm(-1), respectively, for the harmonic frequencies and to 0.02 and 0.05 pm, respectively, for the bond distances.},

In the approach, quadruple excitation contributions are computed from a formula based on a non-Hermitian perturbation theory analogous to that used previously to justify the usual noniterative triples correction used in the coupled cluster singles and doubles method with a perturbative treatment of the triple excitations (CCSD(T)). The method discussed in this paper plays a parallel role in improving energies obtained with the full coupled-cluster singles, doubles, and triples method (CCSDT) by adding a perturbative treatment of the quadruple excitations (CCSDT(Q)). The method is tested for an extensive set of examples, and is shown to provide total energies that compare favorably with those obtained with the full singles, doubles, triples, and quadruples (CCSDTQ) method.},

The performance of the proposed and implemented methods for total energies is assessed with special regard to quadruple and pentuple excitations.

While the extension of iterative approximate models to the non-Hartree-Fock case is straightforward, the generalization of perturbative approaches is not trivial. In contrast to the corresponding perturbative triples methods, there are additional terms required for non-Hartree-Fock reference functions, and there are several possibilities to derive approximations to these terms. As it turns out impossible to develop an approach that is consistent with the canonical Hartree-Fock-based theory, several new approximations have been implemented and their performance for total energies and heats of formation has been assessed. The numerical results show that the performance of the methods does not depend strongly on the approximations assumed. Furthermore, the new perturbative quadruples methods, when applied to canonical Hartree-Fock reference functions, outperform at least for absolute energies the existing ones without increasing the computational costs.},

The approach relies on the fact that the ground-state coupled-cluster energy may be viewed as an eigenvalue of an effective (similarity transformed) Hamiltonian with associated left and right eigenvectors. Taking these as zeroth-order wave functions and using a conventional partitioning of the bare electronic Hamiltonian, the lowest order triple-excitation correction to the correlation energy is found to have an asymmetric form that involves cluster amplitudes as well as components of the left eigenvector. The popular (T) correction may be viewed as an approximation to the present approach, though the latter is approximately a factor of 2 more expensive to compute. The method is applied to a number of difficult cases, including the harmonic vibrational frequencies of ozone and the equilibrium bond length of N2.

abstract = {The general inclusion of the T4 operator into the coupled cluster equations requires an n10 computational procedure, and even n9 in the lowest order, as in the CCSDTQ-1 (coupled cluster singles, doubles, triples and lowest-order quadruples) method. That level of n-dependence makes it difficult to apply the method to larger systems. In this paper we circumvent this difficulty by a factorization approximation that requires only an n7 procedure, but that provides results nearly identical to those obtained with the CCSDTQ-1 method. This observation offers a practical and accurate method to go beyond the CCSDT (coupled cluster singles, doubles and triples) approach. We also consider noniterative CCSDT(Qf) (coupled cluster singles, doubles, triples and noniterative quadruples) and CCSD(TQf) (coupled cluster singles and doubles with noniterative triples and quadruples) methods. {\textcopyright} 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {Perturbation corrections through fifth order in the many-body perturbation theory energy with respect to a coupled cluster singles and doubles reference have been derived and analyzed. The formulas employ the T1 and T2 amplitudes obtained as a solution of the coupled cluster singles and doubles equations. Four different energy functionals have been considered as a starting point in the derivation: the regular coupled cluster energy expression, the coupled cluster functional incorporating $\Lambda$ amplitudes, the one constructed via an expectation value coupled cluster method, and that obtained on the basis of the extended coupled cluster method. The proposed corrections have been applied to several small molecules to test their performance compared to full configuration interaction. The fourth-order $\Lambda$-based formulas improve upon CCSD(T), (coupled cluster singles and doubles with noniterative triples), while the best fifth-order formulas reduce the fourth-order error by about two-thirds. We also introduce a factorized evaluation of connected T4 in fifth order, which reduces its calculation from an n9 algorithm to n7. This permits T4 to be included at approximately the same cost as CCSD(T). {\textcopyright} 1998 American Institute of Physics.},

abstract = {We have obtained uniform frequency scaling factors $\lambda$harm (for harmonic frequencies), $\lambda$fund (for fundamentals), and $\lambda$ZPVE (for zero-point vibrational energies) for the Weigend-Ahlrichs and selected other basis sets, for MP2, SCS-MP2, and a variety of DFT functionals including double hybrids. For selected levels of theory, we have also obtained scaling factors for true anharmonic fundamentals and ZPVEs obtained from quartic force fields. For harmonic frequencies, the double hybrids B2PLYP, B2GP-PLYP, and DSD-PBEP86 clearly yield the best performance at RMSD=10-12 cm-1 for def2-TZVP and larger basis sets -- compared to 5 cm-1 at the CCSD(T) basis set limit. For ZPVEs, again the double hybrids are the best performers, reaching RMSDs as low as 0.05 kcal/mol, but even mainstream functionals like B3LYP can get down to 0.10 kcal/mol. Explicitly anharmonic ZPVEs only are marginally more accurate. For fundamentals, however, simple uniform scaling is clearly inadequate and anharmonic fundamentals from quartic force fields offer superior results --- especially if, in addition, the harmonic frequencies are replaced by basis set limit CCSD(T) values. Among the various basis sets considered, def2-TZVP appears to offer the best compromise between quality and computational cost.},

abstract = {A new, noniterative triples correction to the coupled‐cluster singles and doubles (CCSD), method, for general single determinant reference functions is proposed and investigated numerically for various cases, including non‐Hartree–Fock (non‐HF) reference functions. It is correct through fourth‐order of perturbation theory for non‐HF references, and unlike other such methods, retains the usual invariance properties common to CC methods, while requiring only a single N 7 step. In the canonical Hartree–Fock case, the method is equivalent to the usual CCSD(T) method, but now permits the use of restricted open‐shell Hartree‐Fock (ROHF) and quasirestricted Hartree–Fock (QRHF) reference determinants, along with many others. Comparisons with full configuration interaction (FCI) results are presented for CH2, CH2 +, CH3, NH2, and SiH2. The paper also reports the derivation and initial computational implementation of analytical gradients for the ROHF‐CCSD(T) method, which includes unrestricted Hartree–Fock (UHF) CCSD(T) and RHF‐CCSD(T) as special cases. Applications of analytical gradients are presented for HOO, the CN radical, which is highly spin contaminated at the UHF level, and HCO, the latter with several large basis sets. With these developments of analytical gradients, these highly accurate generalized CCSD(T) methods can be widely applied.},

abstract = {The equilibrium structures, dipole moments, harmonic vibrational frequencies, and infrared intensities of NH3, FON, Be3, BeC2, and BeO2 have been determined using the coupled-cluster and Brueckner electron correlation methods. The singles and doubles coupled-cluster (CCSD) and the Brueckner doubles (BD) methods have been employed and the corresponding methods that include a perturbational estimate of connected triple excitations [i.e., CCSD(T) and BD(T)] have also been investigated. The T1 diagnostic [Int. J. Quantum Chem. Symp. 23, 199 (1989)] is found to provide a good indication of the magnitude of the difference between the results obtained with the coupled-cluster and Brueckner methods. For NH3, the T1 diagnostic is small and so the differences between results obtained from coupled-cluster and Brueckner theories are quite small. For the other four molecules the T1 diagnostic is larger, and so the differences between the coupled-cluster and Brueckner methods become larger. However, it is found for all of the molecules considered in this study that inclusion of the contribution from connected triple excitations is more important than the differences between the Brueckner and coupled-cluster correlation methods. {\textcopyright} 1992 American Institute of Physics.},

Hence, conventional analyses based on perturbation theory cannot satisfactorily explain why the particular fifth-order term included in CCSD(T) should be chosen over a number of other possibilities. This work demonstrates that the terms appearing in CCSD(T) can be justified if one takes the biorthogonal representation of the CCSD state as the zeroth-order wavefunction. This perspective provides some additional insight as to why the method works so well in practice.}

abstract = { We introduce a non-iterative energy correction, added on top of the rank-reduced coupled-cluster method with single, double, and triple substitutions, that accounts for excitations excluded from the parent triple excitation subspace. The formula for the correction is derived by employing the coupled-cluster Lagrangian formalism, with an additional assumption that the parent excitation subspace is closed under the action of the Fock operator. Owing to the rank-reduced form of the triple excitation amplitudes tensor, the computational cost of evaluating the correction scales as N7, where N is the system size. The accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed method is assessed for both total and relative correlation energies. We show that the non-iterative correction can fulfill two separate roles. If the accuracy level of a fraction of kJ/mol is sufficient for a given system, the correction significantly reduces the dimension of the parent triple excitation subspace needed in the iterative part of the calculations. Simultaneously, it enables reproducing the exact CCSDT results to an accuracy level below 0.1 kJ/mol, with a larger, yet still reasonable, dimension of the parent excitation subspace. This typically can be achieved at a computational cost only several times larger than required for the CCSD(T) method. The proposed method retains the black-box features of the single-reference coupled-cluster theory; the dimension of the parent excitation subspace remains the only additional parameter that has to be specified. }

There are two major components of the proposed formalism. The first is an approximate compression of the quadruple excitation amplitudes using the Tucker format. The second is a modified functional used for the evaluation of the corrections which gives exactly the same results for the exact amplitudes, but is less susceptible to errors resulting from the aforementioned compression. We show, both theoretically and numerically, that the computational cost of the proposed method scales as the seventh power of the system size. Using reference results for a set of small molecules, the method is calibrated to deliver relative accuracy of a few percent in energy corrections. To illustrate the potential of the theory, we calculate the isomerization energy of ortho/meta benzyne (C6H4) and the barrier height for the Cope rearrangement in bullvalene (C10H10). The method retains a near-black-box nature of the conventional coupled-cluster formalism and depends on only one additional parameter that controls the accuracy. }

abstract = {Publisher Summary
This chapter presents the fifth-order terms generated by several different coupled-cluster (CC) approaches and compares them with all fifth-order MBPT diagrams. This will enable to analyze the steps required to compute these terms. Several simplifications are identified. In particular, all the fifth-order diagrams arising from T4 may be obtained with only an n6 algorithm. To enumerate the fifth-order terms, a modified type of diagram is introduced that reduces the overall number of fifth-order diagrams. There are several different methods of calculating fifth-order diagrams. One of the most straightforward would be to collect all the different fifth-order diagrams, to factorize them if possible, and to compute them one by one, several of them requiring multiplication by two to account for their Hermitian conjugates demonstrated by comparing, for instance, groups of diagrams. Later, the results discussed in the chapter exhibit that the calculation of the fifth-order energy is feasible and when carefully implemented may be applied to moderate-sized systems. The number of terms that must be considered may be substantially reduced by taking into account the fact that many of the diagrams have identical values and many are amendable to factorization.}

abstract = {The S66 benchmark for noncovalent interactions has been re-evaluated using explicitly correlated methods with basis sets near the one-particle basis set limit. It is found that post-MP2 "high-level corrections" are treated adequately well using a combination of CCSD(F12*) with (aug-)cc-pVTZ-F12 basis sets on the one hand, and (T) extrapolated from conventional CCSD(T)/heavy-aug-cc-pV{D,T}Z on the other hand. Implications for earlier benchmarks on the larger S66x8 problem set in particular, and for accurate calculations on noncovalent interactions in general, are discussed. At a slight cost in accuracy, (T) can be considerably accelerated by using sano-V{D,T}Z+ basis sets, while half-counterpoise CCSD(F12*)(T)/cc-pVDZ-F12 offers the best compromise between accuracy and computational cost.},

The geometry of (H2O)2 is also optimized using the explicitly correlated coupled cluster singles doubles and perturbative triples [CCSD(T)-F12b] method. Overall, we find that the effect of including excitations beyond CCSD(T) is smaller than inclusion of core–valence correlation and comparable to scalar-relativistic and adiabatic effects. }

The diagnostic is a good predictor for sensitivity of energetics to the level of theory, unlike most wavefunction-based diagnostics. For GGA functionals, A values approaching unity indicate severe nondynamical correlation, while values between 0 and about 0.1 indicate systems where correlation is predominantly dynamical in character (or entirely absent). The diagnostic is only weakly sensitive to the basis set (beyond polarized valence double zeta) and can easily be applied to problems beyond the practical reach of wavefunction ab initio methods required for other diagnostics. We also propose a simple measure for the importance of dynamic correlation. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

    abstract = { We present a perspective on the use of diffuse basis functions for electronic structure calculations by density functional theory and wave function theory. We especially emphasize minimally augmented basis sets and calendar basis sets. We base our conclusions on our previous experience with commonly computed quantities, such as bond energies, barrier heights, electron affinities, noncovalent (van der Waals and hydrogen bond) interaction energies, and ionization potentials, on Stephens et al.’s results for optical rotation and on our own new calculations (presented here) of polarizabilities and of potential energy curves of van der Waals complexes. We emphasize the benefits of partial augmentation of the higher-zeta basis sets in preference to full augmentation at a lower ζ level. Benefits and limitations of the use of fully, partially, and minimally augmented basis sets are reviewed for different electronic structure methods and molecular properties. We have found that minimal augmentation is almost always enough for density functional theory (DFT) when applied to ionization potentials, electron affinities, atomization energies, barrier heights, and hydrogen-bond energies. For electric dipole polarizabilities, we find that augmentation beyond minimal has an average effect of 8\% at the polarized triple-ζ level and 5\% at the polarized quadruple-ζ level. The effects are larger for potential energy curves of van der Waals complexes. The effects are also larger for wave function theory (WFT). Even for WFT though, full augmentation is not needed for most purposes, and a level of augmentation between minimal and full is optimal for most problems. The calendar basis sets named after the months provide a convergent sequence of partially augmented basis sets that can be used for such calculations. The jun-cc-pV(T+d)Z basis set is very useful for MP2-F12 calculations of barrier heights and hydrogen bond strengths. }

@article{jmlm200,
abstract = {In an attempt to improve on our earlier W3 theory [A. D. Boese et al., J. Chem. Phys. 120, 4129 (2004)] we consider such refinements as more accurate estimates for the contribution of connected quadruple excitations (T4), inclusion of connected quintuple excitations (T5), diagonal Born-Oppenheimer corrections (DBOC), and improved basis set extrapolation procedures. Revised experimental data for validation purposes were obtained from the latest version of the Active Thermochemical Tables thermochemical network. The recent CCSDT(Q) method offers a cost-effective way of estimating T4, but is insufficient by itself if the molecule exhibits some nondynamical correlation. The latter considerably slows down basis set convergence for T4, and anomalous basis set convergence in highly polar systems makes two-point extrapolation procedures unusable. However, we found that the CCSDTQ-CCSDT(Q) difference converges quite rapidly with the basis set, and that the formula 1.10[CCSDT(Q)cc-pVTZ+CCSDTQcc-pVDZ-CCSDT(Q)cc-pVDZ] offers a very reliable as well as fairly cost-effective estimate of the basis set limit T4 contribution. The T5 contribution converges very rapidly with the basis set, and even a simple double-zeta basis set appears to be adequate. The largest T5 contribution found in the present work is on the order of 0.5 kcal/mol (for ozone). DBOCs are significant at the 0.1 kcal/mol level in hydride systems. Post-CCSD(T) contributions to the core-valence correlation energy are only significant at that level in systems with severe nondynamical correlation effects. Based on the accumulated experience, a new computational thermochemistry protocol for first- and second-row main-group systems, to be known as W4 theory, is proposed. Its computational cost is not insurmountably higher than that of the earlier W3 theory, while performance is markedly superior. Our W4 atomization energies for a number of key species are in excellent agreement (better than 0.1 kcal/mol on average, 95\% confidence intervals narrower than 1 kJ/mol) with the latest experimental data obtained from Active Thermochemical Tables. Lower-cost variants are proposed: the sequence W1-->W2.2-->W3.2-->W4lite-->W4 is proposed as a converging hierarchy of computational thermochemistry methods. A simple a priori estimate for the importance of post-CCSD(T) correlation contributions (and hence a pessimistic estimate for the error in a W2-type calculation) is proposed.},

@article{jmlm205,
abstract = {Basis set convergence of correlation effects on molecular atomization energies beyond the coupled cluster with singles and doubles (CCSD) approximation has been studied near the one-particle basis set limit. Quasiperturbative connected triple excitations, (T), converge more rapidly than L(-3) (where L is the highest angular momentum represented in the basis set), while higher-order connected triples, T3-(T), converge more slowly--empirically, proportional to L(-5/2). Quasiperturbative connected quadruple excitations, (Q), converge smoothly as proportional to L(-3) starting with the cc-pVTZ basis set, while the cc-pVDZ basis set causes overshooting of the contribution in highly polar systems. Higher-order connected quadruples display only weak, but somewhat erratic, basis set dependence. Connected quintuple excitations converge very rapidly with the basis set, to the point where even an unpolarized double-zeta basis set yields useful numbers. In cases where fully iterative coupled cluster up to connected quintuples (CCSDTQ5) calculations are not an option, CCSDTQ(5) (i.e., coupled cluster up to connected quadruples plus a quasiperturbative connected quintuples correction) cannot be relied upon in the presence of significant nondynamical correlation, whereas CCSDTQ(5)(Lambda) represents a viable alternative. Connected quadruples corrections to the core-valence contribution are thermochemically significant in some systems. We propose an additional variant of W4 theory [A. Karton et al., J. Chem. Phys. 125, 144108 (2006)], denoted W4.4 theory, which is shown to yield a rms deviation from experimental atomization energies (active thermochemical tables, ATcT) of only 0.05 kcal/mol for systems for which ATcT values are available. We conclude that "3sigma <or=1 kJ/mol" thermochemistry is feasible with current technology, but that the more ambitious goal of +/-10 cm(-1) accuracy is illusory, at least for atomization energies.},
