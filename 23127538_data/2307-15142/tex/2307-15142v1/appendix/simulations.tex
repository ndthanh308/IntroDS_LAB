One limitation of our general theoretical approach is that it does not directly yield results for a fixed number of recommended items $n$ or for intermediate values of $k$. In particular, a finer-grained theoretical analysis requires closed-form solutions for the order statistics of general distributions, which are often not available. We were able to overcome this in \Cref{prop:uniform}, where we leveraged the simplicity of uniform order statistics.

Here, we take a computational approach to determine the optimal amount of diversity for small $n$ and arbitrary $k.$ \Cref{fig:heatmap} shows the results of a computational approach to calculate the diversity of the optimal set for finite $n$ and general $k$ for a spectrum of Beta and Pareto distributions. For each particular distribution $\DD$, we take $n=30, m=2, p_1=0.7, p_2=0.3$ and find the optimal choice of $a_1$ and $a_2$ by calculating
\begin{equation}
\sum_{t=1}^2 p_t \sum_{i=1}^{\min\{a_t,k\}} \mu_\DD(a_t-i+1,a_t)
\end{equation}
for each possible pair $(a_1,a_2)$ summing to $30$. To do this, we obtained empirical estimates of $\mu_\DD(a-i+1,a)$ by computationally sampling $10^6$ sets of $a$ points from $\DD$. Our computational results corroborate \Cref{thm:general}, showing how the optimal amount of diversity can range from equal representation to homogeneity.

We also compute how diverse optimal solutions are in the case of a Bernoulli distribution as $n$, the number of recommendations, varies. In \Cref{fig:chart}, we consider the distribution $\Ber(0.4)$ and different pairs of popularities $(p_1,p_2).$ We find that as $n$ grows, optimal solutions indeed approach having equal representation, corroborating \Cref{thm:general}(i). For small $n$, optimal solutions tend to be more homogeneous---especially when the popularities are heavily skewed. Indeed, this aligns with intuition: if a user almost exclusively prefers romance, a recommender should still recommend mostly romance movies (even if as the number of recommendations grows very large, the recommendations should become more diverse according to \Cref{thm:general}(i)).
