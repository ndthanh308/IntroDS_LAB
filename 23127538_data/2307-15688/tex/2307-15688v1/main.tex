\begin{abstract}
Understanding and approximating extremal energy states of local Hamiltonians is a central problem in quantum physics and complexity theory.  Recent work has focused on developing approximation algorithms for local Hamiltonians, and in particular the ``Quantum Max Cut'' ({\scshape QMaxCut}) problem, which is closely related to the %well-established 
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model. 
In this work, we introduce a family of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations based on the Navascu{\'e}s-Pironio-Ac{\'i}n (NPA) hierarchy which is tailored for {\scshape QMaxCut} by taking into account its SU(2) symmetry. 
We show that the hierarchy converges to the optimal {\scshape QMaxCut} value at a finite level, 
% In this work, we take the approach of constructing a hierarchy of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations of the problem, 
% %Much of this work relies on relaxations obtained via noncommutative hierarchies 
% %of semidefinite programs (SDPs), 
% which had been extremely successful in the classical analogous case. We specialize the noncommutative Navascu{\'e}s-Pironio-Ac{\'i}n (NPA) hierarchy to introduce a family of SDPs tailored for {\scshape QMaxCut} by taking its SU(2) symmetry into account, proving that for sufficiently large levels of the hierarchy, the  optimal SDP value converges to the correct {\scshape QMaxCut} value.  
%and our results may also be 
which is based on a new characterization of the algebra of SWAP operators.
%as well. 
We give several analytic proofs and computational results %proving or suggesting 
showing
exactness/inexactness of our hierarchy at the lowest level on several important families of graphs.

%as well as computational results 
%and computational results proving exactness of this hierarchy  
%concerning this family. We demonstrate that the family of SDPs converges to the solution of {\scshape QMaxCut} at finite level for any instance, as well as several other exactness/inexactness results for other interesting families of graphs at low levels.

%The NPA hierarchy with its increasing levels provide tighter bounds on the {\scshape QMaxCut} solution. We prove that the SDP family we introduce converges to the true {\scshape QMaxCut} value at a finite level, justifying the use of low-level NPA hierarchy as an approximation.
%opening up new directions for approximation algorithms more tailored to the problem
%We give a proof that the first-level NPA already obtains the exact values for arbitrary positively weighted star graphs, as well as several other exactness/inexactness results for other interesting families of graphs. Our proof for weighted star graph naturally offers a geometric interpretation of monogamy of entanglement equalities in the context of NPA. 

We also discuss relationships between SDP approaches for {\scshape QMaxCut} and frustration-freeness in condensed matter physics and numerically demonstrate that the SDP-solvability practically becomes an efficiently-computable generalization of frustration-freeness.
Furthermore, by numerical demonstration we show the potential of SDP algorithms to perform as an approximate method to compute physical quantities and capture physical features of some Heisenberg-type statistical mechanics models even away from the frustration-free regions.
