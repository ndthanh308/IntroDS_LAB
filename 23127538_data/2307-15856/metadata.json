  "abstract": "Subdifferentials (in the sense of convex analysis) of matrix-valued functions defined on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ that are convex with respect to the Löwner partial order can have a complicated structure and might be very difficult to compute even in simple cases. The aim of this paper is to study subdifferential calculus for such functions and properties of their subdifferentials. We show that many standard results from convex analysis no longer hold true in the matrix-valued case. For example, in this case the subdifferential of the sum is not equal to the sum of subdifferentials, the Clarke subdifferential is not equal to the subdifferential in the sense of convex analysis, etc. Nonetheless, it is possible to provide simple rules for computing nonempty subsets of subdifferentials (in particular, individual subgradients) of convex matrix-valued functions in the general case and to completely describe subdifferentials of such functions defined on the real line. As a by-product of our analysis, we derive some interesting properties of convex matrix-valued functions, e.g. we show that if such function is nonsmooth, then its diagonal elements must be nonsmooth as well.",
