abstract = {We consider a two-level system coupled to an environment that evolves non-adiabatically. We present a non-perturbative method for determining the persistence amplitude whose phase contains all the corrections to Berry's phase produced by the non-adiabatic motion of the environment. Specifically, it includes the effect of transitions between the two energy levels to all orders in the non-adiabatic coupling. The problem of determining all non-adiabatic corrections is reduced to solving an ordinary differential equation to which numerical methods should provide solutions in a variety of situations. We apply our method to a particular example that can be realized as a magnetic resonance experiment, thus raising the possibility of testing our results in the laboratory.}

Here, we propose an alternative Rabi resonance-based microwave imaging technique using a digital micromirror device and an alkali atomic cell. The experimental results well describe the distribution of the microwave field quantitatively and agree with the absorption imaging results. This technique can also be used as a method to analyze and measure the relaxation rate in an atomic vapor cell and offers a SI-traceable imaging approach for the microwave magnetic field. Its simple architecture holds great potential for the development of compact/miniature microwave field sensors.}",
