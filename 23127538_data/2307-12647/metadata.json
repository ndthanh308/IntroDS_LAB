  "abstract": "We theoretically describe the phenomenon of non-adiabatic spin dynamics, which occurs in a gas cell filled by alkali vapor in presence of a strong alternating magnetic field and pump light. Steep increase of the spin polarization occurs if frequency of the magnetic field is equal to the certain value. Although, the observable effect relies on the periodic field that consists of two perpendicular components defined by harmonics with the same amplitudes and different frequencies. Considered spin effect cannot be explained by a resonance, because the own Larmor frequency of spin precession is absent without a constant component of magnetic field. Moreover, there are some clearly visible peaks in the excitation spectrum of spin polarization, and they are super narrow in comparison to relaxation rate. Detailed analysis according to proposed quantum model results in the reasoning of the effect via qualitative properties of non-adiabatic dynamics of atomic spin.",
