  "abstract": "Modified matter power spectra with approximately Gaussian bump on sub-Mpc scales can be a result of a complex inflation. We consider five spectra with different Gaussian amplitudes $A$ and locations $k_0$ and run N-body simulations in a cube $(5 Mpc/h)^3$ at $z>8$ to reveal the halo mass functions and their evolution with redshift. We have found that the Sheth-Tormen formula provides a good approximation to a such kind of halo mass functions. In the considered models the dark matter halo formation starts much more earlier than in $Λ$CDM, which in turn can result in an earlier star formation and a nuclear activity in galaxies and can be detected and tested by, e.g., JWST. At $z=0$ the halo mass functions are hardly distinguishable from the standard $Λ$CDM, therefore the models with the bumpy spectra can be identified in observations by their excess in number of bright sources at high redshift only.",
