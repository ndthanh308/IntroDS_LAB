title = {Alleviating the Need for Exponential Evolution of JWST Galaxies in 1010M⊙ Haloes at z &gt; 10 by a Modified ΛCDM Power Spectrum},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Letters},
abstract = {We infer the evolution of the UV luminosities of galaxies in haloes of masses 1010–1011 M ⊙ in the redshift range of z ∼ 9–16 from the recent JWST data. Within the standard ΛCDM cosmological model, it is found that the average luminosities in this halo mass range show an exponential evolution with redshift, in excess of that expected from astrophysical considerations including the evolution of UV luminosity from Population III galaxies. We find that an enhancement of power on scales k ∼ 1 Mpc−1, as captured by a cosmological transfer function modified from the ΛCDM form, is able to alleviate this effect and allow for a nonevolving UV luminosity as a function of redshift at z &gt; 10, consistently with the corresponding findings for lower redshifts. We discuss the possible astrophysical and cosmological reasons for such an enhancement.}

We study their implications on the primordial power spectrum. In the first part, we use the CEERS photometric survey data, along with respective spectroscopic updates, to compute the cumulative comoving stellar mass density. We find that a very high star formation efficiency (unlikely in various theoretical scenarios) is required to explain these observations within Lambda cold dark matter (ΛCDM) cosmology. We show that the tension can be eased if the primordial power spectrum has a blue tilt. In the second part, we study spectroscopically confirmed galaxies reported in the JADES survey to investigate their implications on a red-tilted primordial power spectrum. We estimate the star formation efficiency from an earlier observation at similar redshift by Spitzer, and find that the star formation efficiency is an order of magnitude smaller than required to explain the CEERS photometric observations mentioned earlier. Using the estimated star formation efficiency, we find the strongest constraints on the red tilt of the power spectrum over some scales. Our study shows that JWST will be an excellent probe of the power spectrum and can lead to novel discoveries.}",

title = {The Effects of Early Cosmic Reionization on the Substructure Problem in Galactic Halos},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Recent observations of the cosmic microwave background by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe strongly suggest that the reionization of the universe took place quite early (z ~ 17). On the other hand, it has been pointed out that the cold dark matter cosmology suffers from a substructure problem in which more subgalactic halos are produced in the Local Group than dwarf galaxies. In this Letter, as a potential mechanism for solving this problem, we consider the feedback effects of early reionization on the formation of small-scale structures. For this purpose, we perform three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamic simulations, incorporating the radiative transfer for ionizing photons. As a result, it is found that the early reionization is devastating for low-mass systems with Mvir ≲ 108 M☉ or vcirc ≲ 20 km s-1, and almost all gas is photoevaporated in more than 95% of low-mass systems. Such a strong negative feedback on the formation of low-mass galaxies may solve the substructure problem and support the picture that Local Group dwarf galaxies are descendants of the more massive halos that experienced and survived tidal stripping.}

title = {STELLAR AND TOTAL BARYON MASS FRACTIONS IN GROUPS AND CLUSTERS SINCE REDSHIFT 1*},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {We investigate if the discrepancy between estimates of the total baryon mass fraction obtained from observations of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) and of galaxy groups/clusters persists when a large sample of groups is considered. To this purpose, 91 candidate X-ray groups/poor clusters at redshift 0.1 ⩽ z ⩽ 1 are selected from the COSMOS 2 deg2 survey, based only on their X-ray luminosity and extent. This sample is complemented by 27 nearby clusters with a robust, analogous determination of the total and stellar mass inside R 500. The total sample of 118 groups and clusters with z ⩽ 1 spans a range in M 500 of ∼1013–1015  M ☉. We find that the stellar mass fraction associated with galaxies at R 500 decreases with increasing total mass as M −0.37 ± 0.04 500, independent of redshift. Estimating the total gas mass fraction from a recently derived, high-quality scaling relation, the total baryon mass fraction (f stars+gas 500 = f stars 500 + f gas 500) is found to increase by ∼25%, when M 500 increases from 〈M〉 = 5 × 1013  M ☉ to 〈M〉 = 7 × 1014  M ☉. After consideration of a plausible contribution due to intracluster light (11%–22% of the total stellar mass) and gas depletion through the hierarchical assembly process (10% of the gas mass), the estimated values of the total baryon mass fraction are still lower than the latest CMB measure of the same quantity (WMAP5), at a significance level of 3.3σ for groups of 〈M〉 = 5 × 1013  M ☉. The discrepancy decreases toward higher total masses, such that it is 1σ at 〈M〉 = 7 × 1014  M ☉. We discuss this result in terms of nongravitational processes such as feedback and filamentary heating.}
