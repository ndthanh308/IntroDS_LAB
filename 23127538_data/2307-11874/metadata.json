  "abstract": "We study the temperature-dependent optical properties of gold over a broad energy spectrum covering photon energies below and above the interband threshold. We apply a semi-analytical Drude-Lorentz model with temperature-dependent oscillator parameters. Our approximations are based on the distribution of electrons over the active bands with a density of states provided by density functional theory. This model can be easily adapted to other materials with similar band structures and can also be applied to the case of occupational nonequilibrium. Our calculations show a strong enhancement of the intraband response with increasing electron temperature while the interband component decreases. Moreover, our model compares well with density functional theory-based calculations for the reflectivity of highly excited gold and reproduces many of its key features. Applying our methods to thin films shows a sensitive nonlinear dependence of the reflection and absorption on the electron temperature. These features are more prominent at small photon energies and can be highlighted with polarized light. Our findings offer valuable insights for modeling ultrafast processes, in particular, the pathways of energy deposition in laser-excited samples.",
