  "abstract": "We consider Schrödinger equations with linearly energy-depending potentials which are compactly supported on the half-line. We first provide estimates of the number of eigenvalues and resonances for such complex-valued potentials under suitable regularity assumptions. Then, we consider a specific class of energy-dependent Schrödinger equations without eigenvalues, defined with Miura potentials and boundary conditions at the origin. We solve the inverse resonance problem in this case and describe sets of iso-resonance potentials and boundary condition parameters. Our strategy consists in exploiting a correspondance between Schrödinger and Dirac equations on the half-line. As a byproduct, we describe similar sets for Dirac operators and show that the scattering problem for Schrödinger equation or Dirac operator with an arbitrary boundary condition can be reduced to the scattering problem with the Dirichlet boundary condition.",
