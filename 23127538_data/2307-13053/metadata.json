  "abstract": "We theoretically study the quasiparticle current behaviour of a thermally-biased bipolar thermoelectrical superconducting quantum interference proximity transistor, formed by a normal metal wire embedded in a superconducting ring and tunnel-coupled to a superconducting probe. In this configuration, the superconducting gap of the wire can be modified through an applied magnetic flux. We analyse the thermoelectric response as a function of magnetic flux, at fixed temperatures, in the case of a device made of the same superconductor. We demonstrate magnetically controllable, bipolar thermoelectric behaviour and discuss optimal working conditions by looking at the thermoelectric power and other figures of merit of the device.",
