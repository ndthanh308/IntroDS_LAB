We have presented stochastic bounds for \gls{tsn} packets in a 802.11 deployment, with queue concurrency and retransmissions due to channel impairments. Our expressions assume the alignment of 802.1Qbv queues with 802.11 \gls{twt} sessions.

This paper provides a preliminary, simplified assessment of dense Industry 4.0 \gls{tsn} wireless deployments. We intend to extend our analysis to more complex scenarios and develop a proof of concept experiments to validate our results.
