\section{Introduction}

\ca{Unscheduled channel access in 802.11 networks negatively impacts their reliability particularly in dense deployments. This is a particularly challenging phenomenon given the imminent use of wireless networks for industry 4.0 applications~\cite{industry4_0}. %Recent improvements proposed in 802.11ax regarding 
\gls{twt} reduces contention by allowing the AP to instruct \gls{sta}s to turn their transceivers on or off at agreed intervals. The discipline thus transforms a dense deployment to one with a manageable number of \gls{sta}s during a \gls{twt} session therefore reducing contention and improving the radio channel access delay. 
Moreover, 802.11be will extend it to \gls{rtwt} to completely eliminate contention\footnote{In 802.11ax contention can be ameliorated with techniques such as trigger-based \gls{ofdma}.}. %Maybe we need to change rTWT to TWT.
%The standard allows \gls{ofdma} in both uplink~(UL) and downlink~(DL) therefore \gls{sta}s can be assigned different \gls{ru}s for transmission in both directions. 
This method has been proposed as a scheduling mechanism in \cite{Chen_TWTscheduler} that achieves improvement in overall network throughput but does not consider the priority of packets. This approach is therefore inadequate for \gls{tsn} flows requiring bounded latency. We propose an enhancement, incorporating \gls{tsn}, by aligning channel access via \gls{rtwt} with 802.1Qbv scheduling. The authors of~\cite{TWT_PoC} provide a proof of concept implementation of \gls{twt} for time aware scheduling that isolates priority traffic from best effort traffic achieving promising results on bounded latency and jitter. We leverage network calculus analysis~\cite{leboudec} to prove that bounded latencies, required by \gls{tsn}, can be achieved using this approach when both high and low priority packets are present in a \gls{sta} with some violation probability that depends on channel quality. In Section~\ref{sec:Qbv_tdma} we model the 802.1Qbv opening gates using Network Calculus~\cite{netcal8021qbv,leboudec}, and in Section~\ref{subsec:concurrent} the wireless errors using stochastic scaling~\cite{stochastic-scaling}. We discuss results in Section~\ref{sec:results} and conclusions in Section~\ref{sec:conclusions}.}
