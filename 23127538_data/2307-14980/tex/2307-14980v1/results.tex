To highlight the importance of these results, we analyze two scenarios: with $(i)$ $T=3$, $L=1$ and $(ii)$  $T=3$, $L=2$.
In both, we calculate the aggregated arrival curves for one non-overlapping queue and two overlapping queues (one with higher priority than the other).
The rest of the parameters are $C=10,\ \alpha^{(0)}=\gamma_{0.1,0.001}$ and $\ N=3$. Additionally, the violation probability of the stochastic scaling curve $\varepsilon$ is $3.3344\cdot10^{-4}$.

Figure~\ref{fig:results} shows the maximum delay experienced by the queues as a function of the loss probability $p$. Note that these bounds hold with a $0.999$ probability. We observe that the delay is reduced with greater overlap. The high priority queue is less impacted compared to the low priority queue. Moreover, comparing the $L/T=1/3$ non-overlapping case with $2/3$ overlapping case, the high priority queue in the latter case experiences less delay at the expense of the low priority queue.
