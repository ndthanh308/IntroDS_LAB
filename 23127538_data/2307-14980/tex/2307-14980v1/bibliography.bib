abstract = {802.11ax introduces OFDMA to WiFi. It thus enables multiplexing users/user groups in the frequency domain. WiFi networks usually operate in a multipath environment which generates a frequency selective channel. Hence, the capacity of a user/user group changes over different subcarriers. A good scheduling and resource allocation scheme can maximize user rates by allocating users and user groups on subcarriers based on their CSI and other system considerations. In this paper, we investigate how to optimally assign users and user groups to subcarriers with the goal of maximizing the throughput in the context of 802.11ax. We introduce a novel divide and conquer based algorithm which we prove to be optimal under the assumption that a user can be assigned to more than one resource unit. We also introduce two practical algorithms, a greedy and a recursive one, which split the bandwidth into resource units and schedule users on them while observing all 802.11ax protocol constraints. Extensive simulations and experiments comparing the performance of the aforementioned algorithms establish that our practical schemes achieve very good performance in all studied scenarios while handling a plethora of real-world constraints.}

ABSTRACT = {The healthcare Internet of Things (H-IoT) is an interconnection of devices capable of sensing and transmitting information that conveys the status of an individual&rsquo;s health. The continuous monitoring of an individual&rsquo;s health for disease diagnosis and early detection is an important application of H-IoT. Ambient assisted living (AAL) entails monitoring a patient&rsquo;s health to ensure their well-being. However, ensuring a limit on transmission delays is an essential requirement of such monitoring systems. The uplink (UL) transmission during the orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) in the wireless local area networks (WLANs) can incur a delay which may not be acceptable for delay-sensitive applications such as H-IoT due to their random nature. Therefore, we propose a UL OFDMA scheduler for the next Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi) standard, the IEEE 802.11be, that is compliant with the latency requirements for healthcare applications. The scheduler allocates the channel resources for UL transmission taking into consideration the traffic class or access category. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheduler can achieve the required latency for H-IoT applications. Additionally, the performance in terms of fairness and throughput is also superior to state-of-the-art schedulers.},
