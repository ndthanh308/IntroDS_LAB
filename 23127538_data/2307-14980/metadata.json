  "abstract": "Industry 4.0 applications impose the challenging demand of delivering packets with bounded latencies via a wireless network. This is further complicated if the network is not dedicated to the time critical application. In this paper we use network calculus analysis to derive closed form expressions of latency bounds for time critical traffic when 802.11 Target Wake Time (TWT) and 802.1Qbv work together in a shared 802.11 network.",
