  "abstract": "Let $\\mathcal{L}$ be finite dimensional restricted Lie algebra over an algebraically closed field $k$ of characteritic $p>3$. A finite dimensional restricted $\\mathcal{L}$-module $V$ is called Richardson if $V$ is faithful and there exists a subspace $R$ of $\\mathfrak{gl}(V)$ such that $[\\mathcal{L},R]\\subseteq R$ and $\\mathfrak{gl}(V)=\\mathcal{L}\\oplus R$, where we identify $\\mathcal{L}$ with its image in $\\mathfrak{gl}(V)$. In this paper we show that if $\\mathcal{L}$ admits an irreducible Richardson module then it is isomorphic (as a restricted Lie algebra) to the Lie algebra of a reductive $k$-group.",
