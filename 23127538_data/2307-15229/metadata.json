  "abstract": "Optomechanical magnetometers enable highly sensitive magnetic field sensing. However, all such magnetometers to date have been optically excited and read-out either via free space or a tapered optical fiber. This limits their scalability and integrability, and ultimately their range of applications. Here, we present an optomechanical magnetometer that is excited and read out via a suspended optical waveguide fabricated on the same silicon chip as the magnetometer. Moreover, we demonstrate that thermomechanical noise limited sensitivity is possible using portable electronics and laser. The magnetometer employs a silica microdisk resonator selectively sputtered with a magnetostrictive film of galfenol (FeGa) which induces a resonant frequency shift in response to an external magnetic field. Experimental results reveal the retention of high quality-factor optical whispering gallery mode resonances whilst also demonstrating high sensitivity and dynamic range in ambient conditions. The use of off-the-shelf portable electronics without compromising sensor performance demonstrates promise for applications.",
