abstract = {In this work, the authors present their recent progress in the development of a platform for the mid-infrared wavelength range, based on suspended silicon waveguides with subwavelength metamaterial cladding. The platform has some intrinsic advantages, which make it a very promising candidate for sensing applications in the molecular fingerprint region. Specifically, it can cover the full transparency window of silicon (up to a wavelength of 8 μm), only requires one lithographic etch-step and can be designed for strong light–matter interaction. Design rules, practical aspects of the fabrication process and experimental results of a complete set of elemental building blocks operating at two very different wavelengths, 3.8 and 7.7 μm, are discussed. Propagation losses as low as 0.82 dB/cm at λ0 = 3.8 μm and 3.1 dB/cm at λ0 = 7.7 μm are attained for the interconnecting waveguides.},

The unique design creates a device that is effectively air clad, resulting in a large refractive index contrast for improved optical field confinement. The measured loss is constant from 658 to 1550 nm, and it is independent of the polarization of the input light and the input power.},

The system works stable and allows profile work without any constraints. In mobile applications the gradient resolution at low frequencies is dominated by motion noise, since the parasitic areas of the SQUID gradiometer lead to strong disturbances if the gradiometer is tilted in the homogenous Earth's magnetic field. The balance can be improved further by software using data of a SQUID magnetometer triple. (© 2005 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

Because much of the recent progress in magnetometry is built on current technology, and to put these advances in the proper perspective, a general discussion of magnetometry will also be presented. The progress includes a remarkable increase in the magnetoresistance of some devices, improved signal processing, and some new types of magnetometer. The large increase in magnetoresistance is a result of an increased understanding of quantum mechanical spin dominated transport in restricted geometries such as multilayers and magnetic tunnel junctions. The new types of magnetometer include magnetoelectric sensors, extraordinary magnetoresistance sensors, and sensors that incorporate MEMS technology. These advances in magnetometer technology offer orders of magnitude increases in sensitivity and/or large decreases in cost and power consumption. Major technological limitations of current magnetic sensors are also discussed.}

ABSTRACT = {Aerospace technologies are crucial for modern civilization; space-based infrastructure underpins weather forecasting, communications, terrestrial navigation and logistics, planetary observations, solar monitoring, and other indispensable capabilities. Extraplanetary exploration—including orbital surveys and (more recently) roving, flying, or submersible unmanned vehicles—is also a key scientific and technological frontier, believed by many to be paramount to the long-term survival and prosperity of humanity. All of these aerospace applications require reliable control of the craft and the ability to record high-precision measurements of physical quantities. Magnetometers deliver on both of these aspects and have been vital to the success of numerous missions. In this review paper, we provide an introduction to the relevant instruments and their applications. We consider past and present magnetometers, their proven aerospace applications, and emerging uses. We then look to the future, reviewing recent progress in magnetometer technology. We particularly focus on magnetometers that use optical readout, including atomic magnetometers, magnetometers based on quantum defects in diamond, and optomechanical magnetometers. These optical magnetometers offer a combination of field sensitivity, size, weight, and power consumption that allows them to reach performance regimes that are inaccessible with existing techniques. This promises to enable new applications in areas ranging from unmanned vehicles to navigation and exploration.},

Here we report ultrasensitive and ultrahigh bandwidth cavity optomechanical magnetometers constructed by embedding a grain of the magnetostrictive material Terfenol-D within a high quality (Q) optical microcavity on a silicon chip. By engineering their physical structure, we achieve a peak sensitivity of 26\&\#x2009;\&\#x2009;pT/Hz comparable to the best cryogenic microscale magnetometers, along with a 3\&\#x00A0;dB bandwidth as high as 11.3\&\#x00A0;MHz. Two classes of magnetic response are observed, which we postulate arise from the crystallinity of the Terfenol-D. This allows single crystalline and polycrystalline grains to be distinguished at the level of a single particle. Our results may enable applications such as lab-on-chip nuclear magnetic spectroscopy and magnetic navigation.},

In this work, we show that quantum correlated light can improve the performance of such sensors, increasing both their sensitivity and their bandwidth. Specifically, we develop a silicon-chip-based cavity optomechanical magnetometer that incorporates phase squeezed light to suppress optical shot noise. At frequencies where shot noise is the dominant noise source, this allows a 20\% improvement in magnetic field sensitivity. Furthermore, squeezed light broadens the range of frequencies at which thermal noise dominates, which has the effect of increasing the overall sensor bandwidth by 50\%. These proof-of-principle results open the door to apply quantum correlated light more broadly in chip-scale sensors and devices.},

ABSTRACT = {Cavity optomechanical magnetic field sensors, constructed by coupling a magnetostrictive material to a micro-toroidal optical cavity, act as ultra-sensitive room temperature magnetometers with tens of micrometre size and broad bandwidth, combined with a simple operating scheme. Here, we develop a general recipe for predicting the field sensitivity of these devices. Several geometries are analysed, with a highest predicted sensitivity of 180 p T / Hz at 28 μ m resolution limited by thermal noise in good agreement with previous experimental observations. Furthermore, by adjusting the composition of the magnetostrictive material and its annealing process, a sensitivity as good as 20 p T / Hz may be possible at the same resolution. This method paves a way for future design of magnetostrictive material based optomechanical magnetometers, possibly allowing both scalar and vectorial magnetometers.},

abstract = {The present study investigates the role of substrate temperatures on the structural, morphological, magnetic and magnetostrictive properties of DC sputtered FeGa thin films grown on Si substrates. These films were deposited at various substrate temperatures between 50 and 350 °C. The structural characterization of the films revealed columnar growth and the transformation of surface morphology from prismatic to spherical at high substrate temperatures. Both L12 and B2 phases of FeGa existed in the films, with the L12 phase dominating. The in-plane and out-of-plane vibration sample magnetometry measurements showed the evolution of magnetic anisotropy in these films. It was revealed from the magnetostriction measurements that the films deposited at 250 °C exhibited the maximum value of 59 ppm.}

    abstract = "{We review the method of producing adiabatic optical micro- and nanofibers using a hydrogen/oxygen flame brushing technique. The flame is scanned along the fiber, which is being simultaneously stretched by two translation stages. The tapered fiber fabrication is reproducible and yields highly adiabatic tapers with either exponential or linear profiles. Details regarding the setup of the flame brushing rig and the various parameters used are presented. Information available from the literature is compiled and further details that are necessary to have a functioning pulling rig are included. This should enable the reader to fabricate various taper profiles, while achieving adiabatic transmission of ∼99\% for fundamental mode propagation. Using this rig, transmissions ranging from 85\% to 95\% for higher order modes in an optical nanofiber have been obtained.}",
