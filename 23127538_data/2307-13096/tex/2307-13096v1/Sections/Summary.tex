Measurements of the inclusive isolated-photon production cross section and of event shapes probing the properties of the multijet energy flow in $pp$ collisions at $\cme = 13$~TeV recorded by the ATLAS experiment at the LHC are presented based on $\thirdlumi$ of $2015-2018$ data.

The dependence on $R$ of the inclusive isolated-photon cross sections is measured for first time, and found to be well described by the NLO \jetphox and NNLO \nnlojet pQCD predictions. The ratios of differential cross sections provide a very stringent test of pQCD, with significantly reduced experimental and theoretical uncertainties, and validate the underlying theoretical description up to $\mcal{O}(\alphas^2)$.

The measurement of transverse energy–energy correlations and their corresponding asymmetries bennefit from the inclusion of NNLO QCD corrections to three-jet production in the theoretical predictions for the first time, allowing a reduction by a factor of 3 of the theoretical uncertainties in both the cross-section calculation for the TEEC and ATEEC distributions and in the determination of the strong coupling constant $\alphas$.

A first application of optimal transport techniques in a collider physics measurement is performed in the measurement of the multijet event isotropies. The measured data are compared with the predictions of several state-of-the-art Monte Carlo event generators. Agreement between the unfolded data and the simulated events tends to be best in balanced, dijet-like arrangements and deteriorates in more isotropic configurations.
