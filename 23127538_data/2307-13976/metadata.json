  "abstract": "In this paper, we determine the finite groups with a Sylow $r$-subgroup contained in a unique maximal subgroup. The proof involves a reduction to almost simple groups, and our main theorem extends earlier work of Aschbacher in the special case $r=2$. Several applications are presented. This includes some new results on weakly subnormal subgroups of finite groups, which can be used to study variations of the Baer-Suzuki theorem.",
