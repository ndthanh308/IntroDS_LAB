  "abstract": "These notes are based on the lectures given by the second author at the School on Optimal Transport on Quantum Structures at Erdös Center in September 2022. The focus of the exposition is on two recently introduced approaches on quantum optimal transport: one based on quantum channels as generalized transport plans, the other based on the notion of Hamming-Wasserstein distance of order 1 on multiple-qubit systems. The material is presented in an elementary manner with a focus on the finite-dimensional setting.",
