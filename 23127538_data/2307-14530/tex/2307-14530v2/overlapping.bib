	abstract = {Watch a martingale with uniformly bounded increments until it first crosses the horizontal line of height \$a\$. The sum of the conditional variances of the increments given the past, up to the crossing, is an intrinsic measure of the crossing time. Simple and fairly sharp upper and lower bounds are given for the Laplace transform of this crossing time, which show that the distribution is virtually the same as that for the crossing time of Brownian motion, even in the tail. The argument can be adapted to extend inequalities of Bernstein and Kolmogorov to the dependent case, proving the law of the iterated logarithm for martingales. The argument can also be adapted to prove Levy's central limit theorem for martingales. The results can be extended to martingales whose increments satisfy a growth condition.},

        abstract = { Community detection has been well studied in network analysis, but the more realistic case of overlapping communities remains a challenge. Here we propose a general, flexible, and interpretable generative model for overlapping communities, which can be viewed as generalizing several previous models in different ways. We develop an efficient spectral algorithm for estimating the community memberships, which deals with the overlaps by employing the \$K\$-medians algorithm rather than the usual \$K\$-means for clustering in the spectral domain. We show that the algorithm is asymptotically consistent when the network is not too sparse and the overlaps between communities are not too large. Numerical experiments on both simulated networks and many real social networks demonstrate that our method performs well compared to a number of benchmark methods for overlapping community detection. }

    abstract = {This paper presents a novel spectral algorithm with additive clustering, designed to identify overlapping communities in networks. The algorithm is based on geometric properties of the spectrum of the expected adjacency matrix in a random graph model that we call stochastic blockmodel with overlap (SBMO). An adaptive version of the algorithm, that does not require the knowledge of the number of hidden communities, is proved to be consistent under the SBMO when the degrees in the graph are (slightly more than) logarithmic. The algorithm is shown to perform well on simulated data and on real-world graphs with known overlapping communities.}

	abstract = {Variational methods are extremely popular in the analysis of network data. Statistical guarantees obtained for these methods typically provide asymptotic normality for the problem of estimation of global model parameters under the stochastic block model. In the present work, we consider the case of networks with missing links that is important in application and show that the variational approximation to the maximum likelihood estimator converges at the minimax rate. This provides the first minimax optimal and tractable estimator for the problem of parameter estimation for the stochastic block model with missing links. We complement our results with numerical studies of simulated and real networks, which confirm the advantages of this estimator over current methods.},

Graphons, developed as limits of graphs, form a natural, nonparametric method to describe and estimate large networks like Facebook and {LinkedIn}. Here we describe the development of the theory of graphons, for both dense and sparse networks, over the last decade. We also review theorems showing that we can consistently estimate graphons from massive networks in a wide variety of models. Finally, we show how to use graphons to estimate missing links in a sparse network, which has applications from estimating social and information networks in development economics, to rigorously and efficiently doing collaborative filtering with applications to movie recommendations in Netflix and product suggestions in Amazon.},
