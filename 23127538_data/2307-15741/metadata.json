  "abstract": "Observational studies are finding stars believed to be relics of the earliest stages of hierarchical mass assembly of the Milky Way (i.e., proto-Galaxy). In this work, we contextualize these findings by studying the masses, ages, spatial distributions, morphology, kinematics, and chemical compositions of proto-galaxy populations from the 13 Milky Way (MW)-mass galaxies from the FIRE-2 cosmological zoom-in simulations. Our findings indicate that proto-Milky Way populations: i) can have a stellar mass range between $1\\times10^{8}<\\mathrm{M}_{\\star}<2\\times10^{10}[\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}]$, a virial mass range between $3\\times10^{10}<\\mathrm{M}_{\\star}<6\\times10^{11}[\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}]$, and be as young as $8 \\lesssim \\mathrm{Age} \\lesssim 12.8$ [Gyr] ($1\\lesssim z \\lesssim 6$); ii) are predominantly centrally concentrated, with $\\sim50\\%$ of the stars contained within $5-10$ kpc; iii) on average show weak but systematic net rotation in the plane of the host's disc at $z=0$ (i.e., $0.25\\lesssim\\langleκ/κ_{\\mathrm{disc}}\\rangle\\lesssim0.8$); iv) present [$α$/Fe]-[Fe/H] compositions that overlap with the metal-poor tail of the host's old disc; v) tend to assemble slightly earlier in Local Group-like environments than in systems in isolation. Interestingly, we find that ~60% of the proto-Milky Way galaxies are comprised by 1 dominant system ($1/5\\lesssim$M$_{\\star}$/M$_{\\star,\\mathrm{proto-Milky Way}}$$\\lesssim4/5$) and 4-5 lower mass systems (M$_{\\star}$/M$_{\\star,\\mathrm{proto-Milky Way}}$$\\lesssim1/10$); the other ~40% are comprised by 2 dominant systems and 3-4 lower mass systems. These massive/dominant proto-Milky Way fragments can be distinguished from the lower mass ones in chemical-kinematic samples, but appear (qualitatively) indistinguishable from one another. Our results could help observational studies disentangle if the Milky Way formed from one or two dominant systems.",
