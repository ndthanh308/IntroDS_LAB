  "abstract": "In this work, we focus on the concept of projected solutions for generalized Nash equilibrium problems. We present new existence results by considering sets of strategies that are not necessarily compact. The relationship between projected solutions and Nash equilibria is studied for the generalized Nash game proposed by Rosen. Finally, we demonstrate that every projected solution of a game is associated with a Nash equilibrium, but in a different game.",
