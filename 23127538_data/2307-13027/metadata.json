  "abstract": "Generalized global symmetries are a common feature of many quantum field theories decoupled from gravity. By contrast, in quantum gravity / the Swampland program, it is widely expected that all global symmetries are either gauged or broken, and this breaking is in turn related to the expected completeness of the spectrum of charged states in quantum gravity. We investigate the fate of such symmetries in the context of 7D and 5D vacua realized by compact Calabi-Yau spaces with localized singularities in M-theory. We explicitly show how gravitational backgrounds support additional dynamical degrees of freedom which trivialize (i.e.,\"break\") the higher symmetries of the local geometric models. Local compatability conditions across these different sectors lead to gluing conditions for gauging higher-form and (in the 5D case) higher-group symmetries. This also leads to a preferred global structure of the gauge group and higher-form gauge symmetries. In cases based on a genus-one fibered Calabi-Yau space, we also get an F-theory model in one higher dimension with corresponding constraints on the global form of the gauge group.",
