@article{Faber:2006wd,
	abstract = {We calculate the first dynamical evolutions of merging black hole-neutron star binaries that construct the combined black hole-neutron star spacetime in a general relativistic framework. We treat the metric in the conformal flatness approximation, and assume that the black hole mass is sufficiently large compared to that of the neutron star so that the black hole remains fixed in space. Using a spheroidal spectral methods solver, we solve the resulting field equations for a neutron star orbiting a Schwarzschild black hole. The matter is evolved using a relativistic, Lagrangian, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) treatment. We take as our initial data recent quasiequilibrium models for synchronized neutron star polytropes generated as solutions of the conformal thin-sandwich (CTS) decomposition of the Einstein field equations. We are able to construct from these models relaxed SPH configurations whose profiles show good agreement with CTS solutions. Our adiabatic evolution calculations for neutron stars with low-compactness show that mass transfer, when it begins while the neutron star orbit is still outside the innermost stable circular orbit, is more unstable than is typically predicted by analytical formalisms. This dynamical mass loss is found to be the driving force in determining the subsequent evolution of the binary orbit and the neutron star, which typically disrupts completely within a few orbital periods. The majority of the mass transferred onto the black hole is accreted promptly; a significant fraction (∼30%) of the mass is shed outward as well, some of which will become gravitationally unbound and ejected completely from the system. The remaining portion forms an accretion disk around the black hole, and could provide the energy source for short-duration gamma-ray bursts.},

	abstract = {The Newtonian Lagrangian perturbation theory is a widely used framework to study structure formation in cosmology in the weakly nonlinear regime. We review a general-relativistic formulation of such a perturbation approach, emphasizing results on already developed extensive formalism including among other aspects: the non-perturbative modeling of Ricci and Weyl curvatures, gravitational waves and pressure-supported fluids. We discuss subcases of exact solutions related to Szekeres Class II and, as exact average model, Ricci-flat LTB models. This latter forms the basis of a generalization that we then propose in terms of a scheme that goes beyond the relativistic Lagrangian perturbation theory on a global homogeneous-isotropic background cosmology. This new approximation does not involve a homogeneous reference background and it contains Szekeres class I (and thus general LTB models) as exact subcases. Most importantly, this new approximation allows for the interaction of structure with an evolving `background cosmology', conceived as a spatial average model, and thus includes cosmological backreaction.},

	abstract = {We present the first numerical analysis of causal, stable first-order relativistic hydrodynamics with ideal gas microphysics, based in the formalism developed by Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha, and Kovtun (BDNK theory). The BDNK approach provides definitions for the conserved stress-energy tensor and baryon current, and rigorously proves causality, local well-posedness, strong hyperbolicity, and linear stability (about equilibrium) for the equations of motion, subject to a set of coupled nonlinear inequalities involving the undetermined model coefficients (the choice for which defines the "hydrodynamic frame"). We present a class of hydrodynamic frames derived from the relativistic ideal gas "gamma-law" equation of state which satisfy the BDNK constraints, and explore the properties of the resulting model for a series of (0+1)D and (1+1)D tests in 4D Minkowski spacetime. These tests include a comparison of the dissipation mechanisms in Eckart, BDNK, and Muller-Israel-Stewart theories, as well as investigations of the impact of hydrodynamic frame on the causality and stability properties of Bjorken flow, planar shockwave, and heat flow solutions.},

	abstract = {We provide a detailed analysis of several aspects of the turduckening technique for evolving black holes. At the analytical level we study the constraint propagation for a family of formulations of Einstein's field equations and identify under what conditions the turducken procedure is rigorously justified and under what conditions constraint violations will propagate to the outside of the black holes. We present high resolution spherically symmetric studies which verify our analytical predictions. Then we present three-dimensional simulations of single distorted black holes using different variations of the turduckening method and also the puncture method. We study the effect that these different methods have on the coordinate conditions, constraint violations, and extracted gravitational waves. We find that the waves agree up to small but nonvanishing differences, caused by escaping superluminal gauge modes. These differences become smaller with increasing detector location.},

@article{Rosswog:2010ui,
	abstract = {We present and test a new, special-relativistic formulation of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Our approach benefits from several improvements with respect to earlier relativistic SPH formulations. It is self-consistently derived from the Lagrangian of an ideal fluid and accounts for the terms that stem from non-constant smoothing lengths, usually called ``grad-h terms''. In our approach, we evolve the canonical momentum and the canonical energy per baryon and thus circumvent some of the problems that have plagued earlier formulations of relativistic SPH. We further use a much improved artificial viscosity prescription which uses the extreme local eigenvalues of the Euler equations and triggers selectively on (a) shocks and (b) velocity noise. The shock trigger accurately monitors the relative density slope and uses it to fine-tune the amount of artificial viscosity that is applied. This procedure substantially sharpens shock fronts while still avoiding post-shock noise. If not triggered, the viscosity parameter of each particle decays to zero. None of these viscosity triggers is specific to special relativity, both could also be applied in Newtonian SPH.The performance of the new scheme is explored in a large variety of benchmark tests where it delivers excellent results. Generally, the grad-h terms deliver minor, though worthwhile, improvements. As expected for a Lagrangian method, it performs close to perfect in supersonic advection tests, but also in strong relativistic shocks, usually considered a particular challenge for SPH, the method yields convincing results. For example, due to its perfect conservation properties, it is able to handle Lorentz factors as large as γ = 50,000 in the so-called wall shock test. Moreover, we find convincing results in a rarely shown, but challenging test that involves so-called relativistic simple waves and also in multi-dimensional shock tube tests.},

@article{Arnowitt:1959vb,
	abstract = {The problem of the dynamical structure and definition of energy for the classical general theory of relativity is considered on a formal level. As in a previous paper, the technique used is the Schwinger action principle. Starting with the full Einstein Lagrangian in first order Palatini form, an action integral is derived in which the algebraic constraint variables have been eliminated. This action possesses a "Hamiltonian" density which, however, vanishes due to the differential constraints. If the differential constraints are then substituted into the action, the true, nonvanishing Hamiltonian of the theory emerges. From an analysis of the equations of motion and the constraint equations, the two pairs of dynamical variables which represent the two independent degrees of freedom of the gravitational field are explicitly exhibited. Four other variables remain in theory; these may be arbitrarily specified, any such specification representing a choice of coordinate frame. It is shown that it is possible to obtain truly canonical pairs of variables in terms of the dynamical and arbitrary variables. Thus a statement of the dynamics is meaningful only after a set of coordinate conditions have been chosen. In general, the true Hamiltonian will be time dependent even for an isolated gravitational field. There thus arises the notion of a preferred coordinate frame, i.e., that frame in which the Hamiltonian is conserved. In this special frame, on physical grounds, the Hamiltonian may be taken to define the energy of the field. In these respects the situation in general relativity is analogous to the parametric form of Hamilton's principle in particle mechanics.},

We use a conformally flat and K=0 initial condition for the evolution of the spacetime. We adopt several slicing conditions to check whether a long time integration is possible in those conditions. For the case in which the amplitude of the gravitational waves is low, a long time integration is possible by using the harmonic slice and the maximal slice, while in the geodesic slice (α=1) it is not possible. As in the axisymmetric case and also in the 3D case, gravitational waves with a sufficiently high amplitude collapse by their self-gravity and their final fates seem to be as black holes. In this case, the singularity avoidance property of the harmonic slice seems weak, so that it may be inappropriate for the formation problems of the black hole. By means of the gauge-invariant wave extraction technique we compute the waveform of the gravitational waves at an outer region. We find that the nonlinearity of Einstein gravity induces the higher multipole modes even if only a quadrupole mode exists initially.},

To this end, we review the various formulations of relativistic second-order dissipative hydrodynamics proposed so far and present in detail a particular formulation that is fully general, causal, and can be cast into a 3+1 flux-conservative form, as the one employed in modern numerical-relativity codes. As an example, we employ a variant of this formulation restricted to a relaxation-type equation for the bulk viscosity in the general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code BHAC. After adopting the formulation for a series of standard and non-standard tests in 1+1-dimensional special-relativistic hydrodynamics, we consider a novel general-relativistic scenario, namely, the stationary, spherically symmetric, viscous accretion on to a black hole. The newly developed solution - which can exhibit even considerable deviations from the inviscid counterpart - can be used as a testbed for numerical codes simulating non-perfect fluids on curved backgrounds.},

	abstract = {Compact binary mergers involving neutron stars can eject a fraction of their mass to space. Being extremely neutron rich, this material undergoes rapid neutron capture nucleosynthesis, and the resulting radioactivity powers fast, short-lived electromagnetic transients known as kilonova or macronova. Such transients are exciting probes of the most extreme physical conditions and their observation signals the enrichment of the Universe with heavy elements. Here we review our current understanding of the mass ejection mechanisms, the properties of the ejecta and the resulting radioactive transients. The first well-observed event in the aftermath of GW170817 delivered a wealth of insights, but much of today's picture of such events is still based on a patchwork of theoretical studies. Apart from summarizing the current understanding, we also point out questions where no consensus has been reached yet, and we sketch possible directions for the future research. In an appendix, we describe a publicly available heating rate library based on the WinNet nuclear reaction network, and we provide a simple fit formula to alleviate the implementation in hydrodynamic simulations.},

	abstract = {With the era of precision cosmology upon us, and upcoming surveys expected to further improve the precision of our observations below the percent level, ensuring the accuracy of our theoretical cosmological model is of the utmost importance. Current tensions between our observations and predictions from the standard cosmological model have sparked curiosity in extending the model to include new physics. Although, some suggestions include simply accounting for aspects of our Universe that are ignored in the standard model. One example acknowledges the fact that our Universe contains significant density contrasts on small scales; in the form of galaxies, galaxy clusters, filaments, and voids. This small-scale structure is smoothed out in the standard model, by assuming large-scale homogeneity of the matter distribution, which could have a measurable effect due to the nonlinearity of Einstein's equations. This backreaction of small-scale structures on the large-scale dynamics has been suggested to explain the measured accelerating expansion rate of the Universe. Current standard cosmological simulations ignore the effects of General Relativity by assuming purely Newtonian dynamics. In this thesis, we take the first steps towards quantifying the backreaction of small-scale structures by performing cosmological simulations that solve Einstein's equations directly. Simulations like these will allow us to quantify potentially important effects on our observations that could become measurable as the precision of these observations increases into the future.},

@article{Buchert:2008tk,
	abstract = {The effective evolution of an inhomogeneous universe model in any theory of gravitation may be described in terms of spatially averaged variables. In Einstein's theory, restricting attention to scalar variables, this evolution can be modeled by solutions of a set of Friedmann equations for an effective volume scale factor, with matter and backreaction source terms. The latter can be represented by an effective scalar field (``morphon field'') modeling Dark Energy. The present work provides an overview over the Dark Energy debate in connection with the impact of inhomogeneities, and formulates strategies for a comprehensive quantitative evaluation of backreaction effects both in theoretical and observational cosmology. We recall the basic steps of a description of backreaction effects in relativistic cosmology that lead to refurnishing the standard cosmological equations, but also lay down a number of challenges and unresolved issues in connection with their observational interpretation. The present status of this subject is intermediate: we have a good qualitative understanding of backreaction effects pointing to a global instability of the standard model of cosmology; exact solutions and perturbative results modeling this instability lie in the right sector to explain Dark Energy from inhomogeneities. It is fair to say that, even if backreaction effects turn out to be less important than anticipated by some researchers, the concordance high-precision cosmology, the architecture of current N-body simulations, as well as standard perturbative approaches may all fall short in correctly describing the Late Universe.},

	abstract = {Accreting black holes (BHs) launch relativistic collimated jets, across many decades in luminosity and mass, suggesting the jet launching mechanism is universal, robust, and scale-free. Theoretical models and general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations indicate that the key jet-making ingredient is large-scale poloidal magnetic flux. However, its origin is uncertain, and it is unknown if it can be generated in situ or dragged inward from the ambient medium. Here, we use the GPU-accelerated GRMHD code H-AMR to study global 3D BH accretion at unusually high resolutions more typical of local shearing box simulations. We demonstrate that turbulence in a radially extended accretion disc can generate large-scale poloidal magnetic flux in situ, even when starting from a purely toroidal magnetic field. The flux accumulates around the BH till it becomes dynamically important, leads to a magnetically arrested disc (MAD), and launches relativistic jets that are more powerful than the accretion flow. The jet power exceeds that of previous GRMHD toroidal field simulations by a factor of 10 000. The jets do not show significant kink or pinch instabilities, accelerate to γ ∼ 10 over three decades in distance, and follow a collimation profile similar to the observed M87 jet.},

	abstract = {We investigate the influence of parametric magnetic field configurations of a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) on electromagnetic (EM) observables, specifically the kilonova lightcurves and nucleosynthesis yields. We perform three-dimensional (3D) dynamical-spacetime general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations, including a neutrino leakage scheme, microphysical finite-temperature equation of state (EOS), and an initial poloidal magnetic field. We find that varying the magnetic field strength and falloff impacts the formation of magnetized winds or mildy-relativistic jets, which in turn has profound effects on the outflow properties. All of the evolved configurations collapse to a black hole (BH) $\sim 21-23$ ms after the onset of the simulations, however, the ones forming jets may be considerably more effective at transporting angular momentum out of the system, resulting in earlier collapse times. Larger mass ejecta rates and radial velocities of unbound material characterise the systems that form jets. The bolometric light curves of the kilonovae and $r$-process yields change considerably with different magnetic field parameters. We conclude that the magnetic field strength and falloff have robust effects on the outflow properties and electromagnetic observables. This can be particularly important as the total ejecta mass from our simulations ($\simeq 10^ -3 \;M_ \odot $) makes the ejecta from HMNS a compelling source to power kilonova through radioactive decay of $r$-process elements.},

@article{Barrera-Hinojosa:2020vy,
	abstract = {We present GRAMSES, a new pipeline for nonlinear cosmological N-body simulations in General Relativity (GR). This code adopts the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) formalism of GR, with constant mean curvature and minimum distortion gauge fixings, which provides a fully nonlinear and background independent framework for relativistic cosmology. Employing a fully constrained formulation, the Einstein equations are reduced to a set of ten elliptical equations which are solved using multigrid relaxation with adaptive mesh refinements (AMR), and three hyperbolic equations for the evolution of tensor degrees of freedom. The current version of GRAMSES neglects the latter by using the conformal flatness approximation, which allows it to compute the two scalar and two vector degrees of freedom of the metric. In this paper we describe the methodology, implementation, code tests and first results for cosmological simulations in a ΛCDM universe, while the generation of initial conditions and physical results will be discussed elsewhere. Inheriting the efficient AMR and massive parallelisation infrastructure from the publicly-available N-body and hydrodynamic simulation code RAMSES, GRAMSES is ideal for studying the detailed behaviour of spacetime inside virialised cosmic structures and hence accurately quantifying the impact of backreaction effects on the cosmic expansion, as well as for investigating GR effects on cosmological observables using cosmic-volume simulations.},

	abstract = {We present a new N-body code, gevolution, for the evolution of large scale structure in the Universe. Our code is based on a weak field expansion of General Relativity and calculates all six metric degrees of freedom in Poisson gauge. N-body particles are evolved by solving the geodesic equation which we write in terms of a canonical momentum such that it remains valid also for relativistic particles. We validate the code by considering the Schwarzschild solution and, in the Newtonian limit, by comparing with the Newtonian N-body codes Gadget-2 and RAMSES. We then proceed with a simulation of large scale structure in a Universe with massive neutrinos where we study the gravitational slip induced by the neutrino shear stress. The code can be extended to include different kinds of dark energy or modified gravity models and going beyond the usually adopted quasi-static approximation. Our code is publicly available.},

	abstract = {Neutron star mergers have recently become a tool to study extreme gravity, nucleosynthesis, and the chemical composition of the Universe. To date, there has been one joint gravitational and electromagnetic observation of a binary neutron star merger, GW170817, as well as a solely gravitational observation, GW190425. In order to accurately identify and interpret electromagnetic signals of neutron star mergers, better models of the matter outflows generated by these mergers are required. We compare a series of ejecta models to see where they provide strong constraints on the amount of ejected mass expected from a system, and where systematic uncertainties in current models prevent us from reliably extracting information from observed events. We also examine 2396 neutron star equations of state compatible with GW170817 to see whether a given ejecta mass could be reasonably produced with a neutron star of said equation of state, and whether different ejecta models provide consistent predictions. We find that the difference between models is often comparable to or larger than the error generally assumed for these models, implying better constraints on the models are needed. We also note that the extrapolation of outflow models outside of their calibration window, while commonly needed to analyze gravitational wave events, is extremely unreliable and occasionally leads to completely unphysical results.},

	abstract = {The Universe is neither homogeneous nor isotropic, but it is close enough that we can reasonably approximate it as such on suitably large scales. The inflationary-$\Lambda$-Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) concordance cosmology builds on these assumptions to describe the origin and evolution of fluctuations. With standard assumptions about stress-energy sources, this system is specified by just seven phenomenological parameters, whose precise relations to underlying fundamental theories are complicated and may depend on details of those fields. Nevertheless, it is common practice to set the parameter that characterizes the spatial curvature, $\Omega_K$, exactly to zero. This parameter-fixed $\Lambda$CDM is awarded distinguished status as separate model, "flat $\Lambda$CDM.'' Ipso facto this places the onus on proponents of "curved $\Lambda$CDM'' to present sufficient evidence that $\Omega_K\neq0$, and is needed as a parameter. While certain inflationary model Lagrangians, with certain values of their parameters, and certain initial conditions, will lead to a present-day universe well-described as containing zero curvature, this does not justify distinguishing that subset of Lagrangians, parameters and initial conditions into a separate model. Absent any theoretical arguments, we cannot use observations that suggest small $\Omega_K$ to enforce $\Omega_K=0$. Our track record in picking inflationary models and their parameters a priori makes such a choice dubious, and concerns about tensions in cosmological parameters and large-angle cosmic-microwave-background anomalies strengthens arguments against this choice. We argue that $\Omega_K$ must not be set to zero, and that $\Lambda$CDM remains a phenomenological model with at least 7 parameters.},

Alternative "shock-avoiding" slicing conditions suggested by Alcubierre prevent these pathologies in those examples, but have not yet been explored and tested very broadly. In this paper we compare the performance of shock-avoiding slicing conditions with those of 1+log slicing for a number of "text-book" problems, including black holes and relativistic stars. While, in some simulations, the shock-avoiding slicing conditions feature some unusual properties and lead to more "gauge-dynamics" than the 1+log slicing condition, we find that they perform quite similarly in terms of stability and accuracy, and hence provide a very viable alternative to 1+log slicing.},

	abstract = {We introduce Preconditioned Monte Carlo (PMC), a novel Monte Carlo method for Bayesian inference that facilitates efficient sampling of probability distributions with non-trivial geometry. PMC utilises a Normalising Flow (NF) in order to decorrelate the parameters of the distribution and then proceeds by sampling from the preconditioned target distribution using an adaptive Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) scheme. The results produced by PMC include samples from the posterior distribution and an estimate of the model evidence that can be used for parameter inference and model comparison respectively. The aforementioned framework has been thoroughly tested in a variety of challenging target distributions achieving state-of-the-art sampling performance. In the cases of primordial feature analysis and gravitational wave inference, PMC is approximately 50 and 25 times faster respectively than Nested Sampling (NS). We found that in higher dimensional applications the acceleration is even greater. Finally, PMC is directly parallelisable, manifesting linear scaling up to thousands of CPUs.},

In this paper, I present the infrastructure for the computation of inhomogeneous dust cosmologies which was used recently to measure the effect of nonlinear inhomogeneity on the cosmic expansion rate. I illustrate the code's architecture, provide evidence for its correctness in a number of familiar cosmological settings, and evaluate its parallel performance for grids of up to several billion points.

	abstract = {We present in a manifestly gauge-invariant form the theory of classical linear gravitational perturbations in part I, and a quantum theory of cosmological perturbations in part II. Part I includes applications to several important examples arising in cosmology: a univese dominated by hydrodynamical matter, a universe filled with scalar-field matter, and higher-derivative theories of gravity. The growth rates of perturbations are calculated analytically in most interesting cases. The analysis is applied to study the evolution of fluctuations in inflationary universe models. Part II includes a unified description of the quantum generation and evolution of inhomogeneities about a classial Friedmann background. The method is based on standard canonical quantization of the action for cosmological perturbations which has been reduced to an expression in terms of a single gauge-invariant variable. The spectrum of density perturbations originating in quantum fluctuations is calculated in universe with hydrodynamical matter, in inflationary universe models with scalar-field matter, and in higher-derivative theories of gravity. <P />The gauge-invariant theory of classical and quantized cosmological perturbations developed in parts I and II is applied in part III to several interesting physical problems. It allows a simple derivation of the relation between temperature anistropes in the cosmic microwave background. radiation and the gauge-invariant potential for metric perturbations. The generation and evolution of gravitational waves is studied. As another example, a simple analysis of entropy perturbations and non-scale-invariant spectra in inflationary universe models is presented. The gauge-invariant theory of cosmological perturbations also allows a consistent and gauge-invariant definition of statistical fluctuations.},

	abstract = {For conformally invariant gravity theories defined on Riemannian spacetime and having the Schwarzschild-de-Sitter (SdS) metric as a solution in the Einstein gauge, we consider whether one may conformally rescale this solution to obtain flat rotation curves, such as those observed in galaxies, without the need for dark matter. Contrary to recent claims in the literature, we show that if one works in terms of quantities that can be physically measured, then in any conformal frame the trajectories followed by `ordinary' matter particles are merely the timelike geodesics of the SdS metric, as one might expect. This resolves the apparent frame dependence of physical predictions and unambiguously yields rotation curves with no flat region. We also show that attempts to model rising rotation curves by fitting the coefficient of the quadratic term in the SdS metric individually for each galaxy are precluded, since this coefficient is most naturally interpreted as proportional to a global cosmological constant. We further extend our analysis beyond static, spherically-symmetric systems to show that the invariance of particle dynamics to the choice of conformal frame holds for arbitary metrics, again as expected. Moreover, we show that this conclusion remains valid for conformally invariant gravity theories defined on more general Weyl-Cartan spacetimes, which include Weyl, Riemann-Cartan and Riemannian spacetimes as special cases.},

@article{Aurrekoetxea:2022wl,
	abstract = {In numerical relativity simulations with non-trivial matter configurations, one must solve the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints of the ADM formulation for the metric variables in the initial data. We introduce a new scheme based on the standard Conformal Transverse-Traceless (CTT) decomposition, in which instead of solving the Hamiltonian constraint as a 2nd order elliptic equation for a choice of mean curvature $K$, we solve an algebraic equation for $K$ for a choice of conformal factor. By doing so, we evade the existence and uniqueness problem of solutions of the Hamiltonian constraint without using the usual conformal rescaling of the source terms. This is particularly important when the sources are fundamental fields, as reconstructing the fields' configurations from the rescaled quantities is potentially problematic. Using an iterative multigrid solver, we show that this method provides rapid convergent solutions for several initial conditions that have not yet been studied in numerical relativity; namely (i) periodic inhomogeneous spacetimes with large random Gaussian scalar field perturbations and (ii) asymptotically flat black hole spacetimes with rotating scalar clouds.},

@article{Mosbech:2022tz,
	abstract = {Similarly to warm dark matter which features a cut-off in the matter power spectrum due to free-streaming, many interacting dark matter models predict a suppression of the matter power spectrum on small length scales through collisional damping. Forecasts for 21cm line intensity mapping have shown that the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will be able to probe a suppression of power in warm dark matter scenarios in a statistically significant way. Here we investigate the implications of these findings on interacting dark matter scenarios, particularly dark matter-neutrino interactions, which we use as an example. Using a suite of cosmological $N$-body simulations, we demonstrate that SKA will be able to set the strongest limits yet on dark matter-neutrino scattering, improving the constraints by two orders of magnitude over current Lyman-$\alpha$ bounds, and by four orders of magnitude over cosmic microwave background and baryon acoustic oscillations limits. However, to distinguish between warm dark matter and interacting scenarios, our simulations show that percent-level precision measurements of the matter power spectrum at redshifts $z\gtrsim15$ are necessary, as the key features of interacting scenarios are washed out by non-linear evolution at later times.},

	abstract = {Relativistic numerical cosmology is most often based either on the exact solutions of the Einstein equations, or perturbation theory, or weak-field limit, or the BSSN formalism. The silent universe provides an alternative approach to investigate relativistic evolution of cosmological systems. The silent universe is based on the solution of the Einstein equations in 1  +  3 comoving coordinates with additional constraints imposed. These constraints include: the gravitational field is sourced by dust and cosmological constant only, both rotation and magnetic part of the Weyl tensor vanish, and the shear is diagnosable. This paper describes the code simsilun (free software distributed under the terms of the reposi General Public License), which implements the equations of the silent universe. The paper also discusses applications of the silent universe and it uses the Millennium simulation to set up the initial conditions for the code simsilun. The simulation obtained this way consists of 16 777 216 worldlines, which are evolved from z  =  80 to z  =  0. Initially, the mean evolution (averaged over the whole domain) follows the evolution of the background ΛCDM model. However, once the evolution of cosmic structures becomes nonlinear, the spatial curvature evolves from Ω<SUB>K</SUB> =0 to Ω<SUB>K</SUB> ≈ 0.1 at the present day. The emergence of the spatial curvature is associated with Ω<SUB>M</SUB> and Ω_Λ being smaller by approximately 0.05 compared to the ΛCDM.},

	abstract = {Fast material ejected dynamically over $<10$ ms during the merger of a binary neutron-star (BNS) system can give rise to distinctive electromagnetic counterparts to the system's gravitational-wave emission that can serve as a "smoking gun" to distinguish between a BNS and a NS-black-hole merger. We present novel ab-initio modeling of the associated kilonova precursor and kilonova afterglow based on three-dimensional general-relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of BNS mergers with tabulated, composition-dependent, finite-temperature equations of state (EOSs), weak interactions, and approximate neutrino transport. We analyze dynamical mass ejection from 1.35-1.35Msun binaries, typical of Galactic double-NS systems and consistent with properties of the first observed BNS merger GW170817, using three nuclear EOSs that span the range of allowed compactness. Nuclear reaction network calculations yield a robust 2nd-to-3rd-peak r-process. We find few x 1e-6Msun of fast ($v>0.6$c) ejecta that give rise to broad-band synchrotron emission on ~yr timescales, consistent with recent tentative evidence for excess X-ray/radio emission following GW170817. We find 2e-5Msun of free neutrons that power a kilonova precursor on <h timescale. A boost in early UV/optical brightness by a factor of a few due to previously neglected relativistic effects, with appreciable enhancements up to 10h post-merger, provides promising prospects for future detection with UV/optical telescopes such as Swift or ULTRASAT out to 250Mpc. We find that a recently predicted opacity boost due to highly ionized lanthanides at ~70000K is unlikely to affect the early kilonova lightcurve based on the obtained ejecta structures. Azimuthal inhomogeneities in dynamical ejecta composition for soft EOSs found here ("lanthanide/actinide pockets") may have observable consequences for both early kilonova and late-time nebular emission.},

	abstract = {We report on a new capability added to our general relativistic radiation-magnetohydrodynamics code, Cosmos++: an implicit Monte Carlo (IMC) treatment for radiation transport. The method is based on a Fleck-type implicit discretization of the radiation-hydrodynamics equations, but generalized for both Newtonian and relativistic regimes. A multiple reference frame approach is used to geodesically transport photon packets (and solve the hydrodynamics equations) in the coordinate frame, while radiation-matter interactions are handled either in the fluid or electron frames then communicated via Lorentz boosts and orthonormal tetrad bases attached to the fluid. We describe a method for constructing estimators of radiation moments using path-weighting that generalizes to arbitrary coordinate systems in flat or curved spacetime. Absorption, emission, scattering, and relativistic Comptonization are among the matter interactions considered in this report. We discuss our formulations and numerical methods, and validate our models against a suite of radiation and coupled radiation-hydrodynamics test problems in both flat and curved spacetimes.},

	abstract = {To study binary neutron star systems and to interpret observational data such as gravitational-wave and kilonova signals, one needs an accurate description of the processes that take place during the final stages of the coalescence, e.g., through numerical-relativity simulations. In this work, we present an updated version of the numerical-relativity code BAM in order to incorporate nuclear-theory based Equations of State and a simple description of neutrino interactions through a Neutrino Leakage Scheme. Different test simulations, for stars undergoing a neutrino-induced gravitational collapse and for binary neutron stars systems, validate our new implementation. For the binary neutron stars systems, we show that we can evolve stably and accurately distinct microphysical models employing the different equations of state: SFHo, DD2, and the hyperonic BHB$\Lambda \phi$. Overall, our test simulations have good agreement with those reported in the literature.},

@article{Cusinato:2021ur,
	abstract = {Neutrinos are copiously emitted by neutron star mergers, due to the high temperatures reached by dense matter during the merger and its aftermath. Neutrinos influence the merger dynamics and shape the properties of the ejecta, including the resulting $r$-process nucleosynthesis and kilonova emission. In this work, we analyze neutrino emission from a large sample of merger radiation hydrodynamics simulations in Numerical Relativity, covering a broad range of initial masses, nuclear equation of state and viscosity treatments. We extract neutrino luminosities and mean energies, and compute quantities of interest such as the peak values, peak broadnesses, time averages and decrease time scales. We provide a systematic description of such quantities, including their dependence on the initial parameters of the system. We find that for equal-mass systems the total neutrino luminosity (several $10^ 53  \rm erg~s^ -1  $) decreases for increasing reduced tidal deformability, as a consequence of the less violent merger dynamics. Similarly, tidal disruption in asymmetric mergers leads to systematically smaller luminosities. Peak luminosities can be twice as large as the average ones. Electron antineutrino luminosities dominate (initially by a factor of 2-3) over electron neutrino ones, while electron neutrinos and heavy flavour neutrinos have similar luminosities. Mean energies are nearly constant in time and independent on the binary parameters. Their values reflect the different decoupling temperature inside the merger remnant. Despite present uncertainties in neutrino modelling, our results provide a broad and physically grounded characterization of neutrino emission, and they can serve as a reference point to develop more sophisticated neutrino transport schemes.},

@article{Di-Clemente:2022vc,
	abstract = {A kilonova (KN) signal is generally expected after a black hole-neutron star merger. The strength of the signal is related to the equation of state of neutron star matter, and it increases with the stiffness of the latter. The recent results obtained by NICER from the analyses of PSR J0740+6620 suggest a rather stiff equation of state, and the expected KN signal is therefore strong, at least if the mass of the black hole does not exceed ~10 M <SUB>⊙</SUB>, the adimensional spin parameter is not too small, and the orbit is prograde. We compare the predictions obtained by considering equations of state of neutron star matter satisfying the most recent observations and assuming that only one family of compact stars exists with the results predicted in the two-families scenario. In the latter a soft hadronic equation of state produces very compact stellar objects, while a rather stiff quark matter equation of state produces massive strange quark stars, satisfying NICER results. The expected KN signal in the two-families scenario is very weak: in particular, the hadronic star-black hole merger produces a much weaker signal than in the one-family scenario because the hadronic equation of state is very soft. Moreover, according to the only existing simulation, the strange quark star-black hole merger does not produce a KN signal because the amount of mass ejected is negligible. These predictions will be easily tested with the new generation of detectors if black holes with an adimensional spin parameter χ <SUB>BH</SUB> ≳ 0.2 or a mass M <SUB>BH</SUB> ≲ 4 M <SUB>⊙</SUB> can be present in the merger.},

We develop an improved shock capturing formulation that distinguishes between shock viscosity and conductivity in relativity. We also describe a new Hamiltonian time integration algorithm for relativistic orbital dynamics and GRSPH. Our method correctly captures both Einstein and spin-induced precession around black holes. We benchmark our scheme in 1D and 3D against mildly and ultra-relativistic shock tubes, exact solutions for epicyclic and vertical oscillation frequencies, and Bondi accretion. We assume fixed background metrics (Minkowski, Schwarzschild and Kerr in Cartesian Boyer-Lindquist coordinates), but the method lays the foundation for future direct coupling with numerical relativity.},

	abstract = {We present the new general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) capabilities of the Einstein toolkit, an open-source community-driven numerical relativity and computational relativistic astrophysics code. The GRMHD extension of the toolkit builds upon previous releases and implements the evolution of relativistic magnetized fluids in the ideal MHD limit in fully dynamical spacetimes using the same shock-capturing techniques previously applied to hydrodynamical evolution. In order to maintain the divergence-free character of the magnetic field, the code implements both constrained transport and hyperbolic divergence cleaning schemes. We present test results for a number of MHD tests in Minkowski and curved spacetimes. Minkowski tests include aligned and oblique planar shocks, cylindrical explosions, magnetic rotors, Alfv{\'e}n waves and advected loops, as well as a set of tests designed to study the response of the divergence cleaning scheme to numerically generated monopoles. We study the code's performance in curved spacetimes with spherical accretion onto a black hole on a fixed background spacetime and in fully dynamical spacetimes by evolutions of a magnetized polytropic neutron star and of the collapse of a magnetized stellar core. Our results agree well with exact solutions where these are available and we demonstrate convergence. All code and input files used to generate the results are available on http://einsteintoolkit.org. This makes our work fully reproducible and provides new users with an introduction to applications of the code.},

	abstract = {We describe the Einstein Toolkit, a community-driven, freely accessible computational infrastructure intended for use in numerical relativity, relativistic astrophysics, and other applications. The toolkit, developed by a collaboration involving researchers from multiple institutions around the world, combines a core set of components needed to simulate astrophysical objects such as black holes, compact objects, and collapsing stars, as well as a full suite of analysis tools. The Einstein Toolkit is currently based on the Cactus framework for high-performance computing and the Carpet adaptive mesh refinement driver. It implements spacetime evolution via the BSSN evolution system and general relativistic hydrodynamics in a finite-volume discretization. The toolkit is under continuous development and contains many new code components that have been publicly released for the first time and are described in this paper. We discuss the motivation behind the release of the toolkit, the philosophy underlying its development, and the goals of the project. A summary of the implemented numerical techniques is included, as are results of numerical test covering a variety of sample astrophysical problems.},

We begin by discussing relevant kernel approximation techniques and discuss the performance of different kernel functions. Subsequently, we review a number of different SPH formulations of Newtonian, special- and general relativistic ideal fluid dynamics. We particularly point out recent developments that increase the accuracy of SPH with respect to commonly used techniques. The second main part of the review is dedicated to the application of SPH in compact object simulations. We discuss encounters between two white dwarfs, between two neutron stars and between a neutron star and a stellar-mass black hole. For each type of system, the main focus is on the more common, gravitational wave-driven binary mergers, but we also discuss dynamical collisions as they occur in dense stellar systems such as cores of globular clusters.},

	abstract = {We present a new methodology for simulating self-gravitating general-relativistic fluids. In our approach the fluid is modelled by means of Lagrangian particles in the framework of a general-relativistic (GR) smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) formulation, while the spacetime is evolved on a mesh according to the Baumgarte-Shapiro-Shibata-Nakamura (BSSN) formulation that is also frequently used in Eulerian GR-hydrodynamics. To the best of our knowledge this is the first Lagrangian fully general relativistic hydrodynamics code (all previous SPH approaches used approximations to GR-gravity). A core ingredient of our particle-mesh approach is the coupling between the gas (represented by particles) and the spacetime (represented by a mesh) for which we have developed a set of sophisticated interpolation tools that are inspired by other particle-mesh approaches, in particular by vortex-particle methods. One advantage of splitting the methodology between matter and spacetime is that it gives us more freedom in choosing the resolution, so that---if the spacetime is smooth enough---we obtain good results already with a moderate number of grid cells and can focus the computational effort on the simulation of the matter. Further advantages of our approach are the ease with which ejecta can be tracked and the fact that the neutron star surface remains well-behaved and does not need any particular treatment. In the hydrodynamics part of the code we use a number of techniques that are new to SPH, such as reconstruction, slope limiting and steering dissipation by monitoring entropy conservation. We describe here in detail the employed numerical methods and demonstrate the code performance in a number of benchmark problems ranging from shock tube tests, over Cowling approximations to the fully dynamical evolution of neutron stars in self-consistently evolved spacetimes.},

	abstract = {The broad, $\sim 4$ order of magnitude range in energy, inferred via afterglow observations, for the short Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) population is difficult to reconcile with the narrow energy distribution expected from neutron star merger progenitors. Using the resultant profiles from 3D hydrodynamic simulations of relativistic jets interacting with neutron star merger wind ejecta, we show how the inhomogeneity of energy and velocity can alter the observed afterglow lightcurve. From a single jet we find that the peak afterglow flux depends sensitively on the observer's line-of-sight: at an inclination within the GRB emitting region we find peak flux variability on the order $&lt;0.5$ dex through rotational orientation, and $&lt;1.3$ dex for polar inclination. The inferred jet kinetic energy for a fixed parameter afterglow covers $\sim 1/3$ of the observed short GRB population. We find a physically motivated, analytic jet structure function via our simulations and include an approximation for the varying collimation due to the merger ejecta mass. We show that by considering the observed range of merger ejecta masses, a short GRB jet population with a single intrinsic energy is capable of explaining the observed broad diversity in short GRB kinetic energies.},

This code evolves the spacetime on a mesh using the BSSN formulation, but matter is evolved via Lagrangian particles according to a high-accuracy version of general-relativistic Smooth Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Our code contains a number of new methodological elements compared to other Numerical Relativity codes. The main focus here is on the new elements that were introduced to model neutron star mergers. These include (a) a refinement (fixed in time) of the spacetime-mesh, (b) corresponding changes in the particle-mesh mapping algorithm and (c) a novel way to construct SPH initial data for binary systems via the recently developed "Artificial Pressure Method." This latter method makes use of the spectral initial data produced by the library LORENE, and is implemented in a new code called SPHINCS_ID. While our main focus is on introducing these new methodological elements and documenting the current status of SPHINCS_BSSN, we also show as a first application a set of neutron star merger simulations employing "soft" (Γ =2.00 ) and "stiff" (Γ =2.75 ) polytropic equations of state.},

	abstract = {The observation of gravitational waves from compact objects has now become an active part of observational astronomy. For a sound interpretation, one needs to compare such observations against detailed Numerical Relativity simulations, which are essential tools to explore the dynamics and physics of compact binary mergers. To date, essentially all simulation codes that solve the full set of Einstein's equations are performed in the framework of Eulerian hydrodynamics. The exception is our recently developed Numerical Relativity code \SpB which solves the commonly used BSSN formulation of Einstein equations on a structured mesh and the matter equations via Lagrangian particles. We show here, for the first time, \SpB neutron star merger simulations with piecewise polytropic approximations to four nuclear matter equations of state. We introduce some further methodological refinements (a new way of steering dissipation, an improved particle-mesh mapping) and we explore the impact of the exponent that enters in the calculation of the thermal pressure contribution. We find that it leaves a noticeable imprint on the gravitational wave amplitude (calculated via both quadrupole approximation and the $\Psi_4$-formalism) and has a noticeable impact on the amount of dynamic ejecta. Consistent with earlier findings, we only find a few times $10^ -3 $ \Msun as dynamic ejecta in the studied equal mass binary systems, with softer equations of state (which are more prone to shock formation) ejecting larger amounts of matter. We also see a credible high-velocity ($\sim0.5 .. 0.7c$) ejecta component of $\sim 10^ -4 $ \Msun in all our cases. Such a high-velocity component has been suggested to produce an early, blue precursor to the main kilonova emission and it could also potentially cause a kilonova afterglow.},

@article{Setzer:2022vv,
	abstract = {The 2017 detection of a kilonova coincident with gravitational-wave emission has identified neutron star mergers as the major source of the heaviest elements, and dramatically constrained alternative theories of gravity. Observing a population of such sources has the potential to transform cosmology, nuclear physics, and astrophysics. However, with only one confident detection currently available, modelling the diversity of signals expected from such a population requires improved theoretical understanding. In particular, models which are quick to evaluate, and are calibrated with more detailed multi-physics simulations, are needed to design observational strategies for kilonovae detection, and to obtain rapid-response interpretations of new observations. We use grey-opacity models to construct populations of kilonovae, spanning ejecta parameters predicted by numerical simulations. Our modelling focuses on wavelengths relevant for upcoming optical surveys, such as the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). In these simulations, we implement heating rates that are based on nuclear reaction network calculations. We create a Gaussian-process emulator for kilonova grey opacities, calibrated with detailed radiative transfer simulations. Using recent fits to numerical relativity simulations, we predict how the ejecta parameters from BNS mergers shape the population of kilonovae, accounting for the viewing-angle dependence. Our simulated population of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers produce peak i-band absolute magnitudes $-17 \leq M_i \leq -11$. A comparison with detailed radiative transfer calculations indicates that further improvements are needed to accurately reproduce spectral shapes over the full light curve evolution.},

	abstract = {The majority of existing results for the kilonova (or macronova) emission from material ejected during a neutron-star (NS) merger is based on (quasi-) one-zone models or manually constructed toy-model ejecta configurations. In this study, we present a kilonova analysis of the material ejected during the first $\sim 10\,$ ms of a NS merger, called dynamical ejecta, using directly the outflow trajectories from general relativistic smoothed-particle hydrodynamics simulations, including a sophisticated neutrino treatment and the corresponding nucleosynthesis results, which have been presented in Part I of this study. We employ a multidimensional two-moment radiation transport scheme with approximate M1 closure to evolve the photon field and use a heuristic prescription for the opacities found by calibration with atomic-physics-based reference results. We find that the photosphere is generically ellipsoidal but augmented with small-scale structure and produces emission that is about 1.5-3 times stronger towards the pole than the equator. The kilonova typically peaks after $0.7\!-\!1.5\,$ d in the near-infrared frequency regime with luminosities between $3\!-\!7\times 10^ 40 \,$ erg s<SUP>-1</SUP> and at photospheric temperatures of $2.2\!-\!2.8\times 10^3\,$ K. A softer equation of state or higher binary-mass asymmetry leads to a longer and brighter signal. Significant variations of the light curve are also obtained for models with artificially modified electron fractions, emphasizing the importance of a reliable neutrino-transport modelling. None of the models investigated here, which only consider dynamical ejecta, produces a transient as bright as AT2017gfo. The near-infrared peak of our models is incompatible with the early blue component of AT2017gfo.},

	abstract = {We perform large-scale cosmological simulations that solve Einstein's equations directly via numerical relativity. Starting with initial conditions sampled from the cosmic microwave background, we track the emergence of a cosmic web without the need for a background cosmology. We measure the backreaction of large-scale structure on the evolution of averaged quantities in a matter-dominated universe. Although our results are preliminary, we find the global backreaction energy density is of order 10<SUP>-8</SUP> compared to the energy density of matter in our simulations, and is thus unlikely to explain accelerating expansion under our assumptions. Sampling scales above the homogeneity scale of the Universe (100 - 180 h<SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc ), in our chosen gauge, we find 2-3% variations in local spatial curvature.},

We demonstrate fourth-order convergence with errors less than one part in 1 0<SUP>6</SUP> in evolving a flat, dust Friedmann-Lema{\^\i}tre-Roberston-Walker spacetime using the Einstein Toolkit within the Cactus framework. We also demonstrate agreement to within one part in 1 0<SUP>3</SUP> between the numerical relativity solution and the linear solution for density, velocity and metric perturbations in the Hubble flow over a factor of ∼350 change in scale factor (redshift). We simulate the growth of linear perturbations into the nonlinear regime, where effects such as gravitational slip and tensor perturbations appear. We therefore show that numerical relativity is a viable tool for investigating nonlinear effects in cosmology.},
