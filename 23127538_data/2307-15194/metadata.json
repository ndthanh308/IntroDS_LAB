  "abstract": "We perform three-dimensional simulations of homogeneous and inhomogeneous cosmologies via the coupling of a numerical relativity code for spacetime evolution and smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code. Evolution of a flat dust and radiation dominated Friedmann-Lemaître-Roberston-Walker (FLRW) spacetime shows an agreement of exact solutions with residuals on the order $10^{-6}$ and $10^{-3}$ respectively, even at low grid resolutions. We demonstrate evolution of linear perturbations of density, velocity and metric quantities to the FLRW with residuals of only $10^{-2}$ compared to exact solutions. Finally, we demonstrate the evolution of non-linear perturbations of the metric past shell-crossing, such that dark matter halo formation is possible. We show that numerical relativistic smoothed particle hydrodynamics is a viable method for understanding non-linear effects in cosmology.",
