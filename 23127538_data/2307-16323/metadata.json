  "abstract": "We study $\\ell^r$-valued extensions of linear operators defined on Lebesgue spaces with variable exponent. Under some natural (and usual) conditions on the exponents, we characterize $1\\leq r\\leq \\infty$ such that every bounded linear operator $T\\colon L^{q(\\cdot)}(Ω_2, μ)\\to L^{p(\\cdot)}(Ω_1, ν)$ has a bounded $\\ell^r$-valued extension. We consider both non-atomic measures and measures with atoms and show the differences that can arise. We present some applications of our results to weighted norm inequalities of linear operators and vector-valued extensions of fractional operators with rough kernel.",
