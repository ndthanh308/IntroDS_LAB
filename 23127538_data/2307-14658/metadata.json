  "abstract": "Let G be a group which is topologically a CW-complex, BG a classifying space for G, and A a discrete abelian group. To a central extension of G by A, one can associate a cohomology class in $H^2(BG,A)$. We show this association is injective, and bijective in many cases. A homomorphism to G lifts to the extension iff the pullback of the associated cohomology class vanishes.",
