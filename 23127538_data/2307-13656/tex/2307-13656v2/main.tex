\begin{abstract}

Motivated by  applications in e-retail and online advertising, we study  the problem of assortment optimization under visibility constraints, that we refer to as \ref{APV}. We are given a universe of substitutable products and a stream of $T$ customers. The objective is to determine the optimal assortment of products to offer to each customer in order to maximize the total expected revenue, subject to the constraint that each product is required to be shown to a minimum number of customers. The minimum display requirement for each product is given exogenously and we refer to these constraints as {\em visibility constraints}.   We assume that customer choices follow a Multinomial Logit model (MNL). 

We provide a characterization of the structure of the optimal assortments  and present an efficient polynomial time algorithm for solving \ref{APV}. To accomplish this, we introduce a novel function called the ``expanded revenue" of an assortment and establish its supermodularity. Our algorithm takes advantage of this structural property. Additionally, we demonstrate that \ref{APV}  can be formulated as a compact linear program. Next, we consider \ref{APV} with cardinality constraints, which we prove to be strongly NP-hard and not admitting a Fully Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS), even in the special case where all the products have identical prices. Subsequently, we devise a Polynomial Time Approximation Scheme (PTAS) for \ref{APV} under cardinality constraints with identical prices. Our algorithm starts by linearizing the objective function through a carefully crafted guessing procedure, then solves the linearized program, and finally randomly rounds the obtained solution to derive a near optimal solution for \ref{APV} with cardinality constraints.
We also examine the revenue loss resulting from the enforcement of visibility constraints, comparing it to the unconstrained version of the problem. To offset this loss, we propose a novel strategy to distribute the loss among the products subject to visibility constraints. Each vendor is charged an amount proportional to their product's contribution to the revenue loss. Finally, we present the results of our numerical experiments providing illustration of the obtained outcomes.
