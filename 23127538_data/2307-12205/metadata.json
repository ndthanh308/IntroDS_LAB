  "abstract": "The electron's kinetic energy plays a pivotal role in magnetism. While virtual electron hopping promotes antiferromagnetism in an insulator, the real process usually favors ferromagnetism. But in kinetically frustrated systems, such as hole doped triangular lattice Mott insulators, real hopping has been shown to favor antiferromagnetism. Kinetic frustration has also been predicted to induce a new quasiparticle -- a bound state of the doped hole and a spin flip called a spin polaron -- at intermediate magnetic fields, which could form an unusual metallic state. However, the direct experimental observation of spin polarons has remained elusive. Here we report the observation of spin polarons in triangular lattice MoTe2/WSe2 moiré bilayers by the reflective magnetic circular dichroism measurements. We identify a spin polaron phase at lattice filling factor between 0.8-1 and magnetic field between 2-4 T; it is separated from the fully spin polarized phase by a metamagnetic transition. We determine that the spin polaron is a spin-3/2 particle and its binding energy is commensurate to the kinetic hopping energy. Our results open the door for exploring spin polaron pseudogap metals, spin polaron pairing and other new phenomena in triangular lattice moiré materials.",
