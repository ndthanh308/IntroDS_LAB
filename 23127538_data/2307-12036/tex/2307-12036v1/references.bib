  abstract = {Traditional software used for student-centered learning typically provides for a uniform user interface through which the student can interact with the software, and through which the information is delivered in a uniformly identical fashion to all users without regard to their learning style. This research classifies personality types of computer science undergraduate students using the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator; relates these types of personalities to defined learning preferences; and tests if a given user interface designed for a given learning preference enhances learning. The general approach of this study is as follows: given a set of user interfaces designed to fit personality types, provide a given user interface to participants with the matching personality type. In the control group, provide participants with a randomly chosen user interface. Observe the performance of all participants in a post-test. Additionally, observe if the test group had an enhanced learning experience. Quantitative results indicate that personality-aware user interfaces have a significant effect on learning. Qualitative results show that in most cases, users preferred user interfaces designed for their own personality type. Preliminary results show that for introverted intuitive persons and extraverted intuitive persons, the effect of a personality-aware human-computer interface on learning is significant.},

In particular, personality shapes how we process and act on the world, and how users perceive and accept technology. Nevertheless, there is limited evidence on the effect of different personality types in graphical user interface design preferences. Weighting how personality affects perception, we leverage in-depth synergies between personality variables and design preferences for graphical user interface elements to study whether it is possible to formulate a novel set of design guidelines that allow the creation of user interfaces customized to psychological variables. A clustering approach of the subjects (N=65) yielded three different personality profiles based on the personality variables of the Five-Factor Model. Then, an association rules algorithm produced a set of rules from which we created a set of design guidelines. We discuss the study implications and future work opportunities.},

  abstract = {Personality types are construed as constellations of features that uniquely define discrete groups of individuals. Types are conceptually convenient because they summarize many traits in a single label, but until recently most researchers agreed that there was little evidence for the existence of discrete personality types. Several groups of researchers have now proposed replicable, empirical person clusters based on measures of the Five-Factor Model. We consider several methodological artifacts that might be responsible for these types, and conclude that these artifacts may contribute to the replicability of types, but cannot entirely account for it. The present research attempts to replicate these types in four large and diverse adult samples: the Baltimore Longitudinal Study of Aging (N\,=\,1856); the East Baltimore Epidemiologic Catchment Area study (N\,=\,486); the University of North Carolina Alumni Heart Study (N\,=\,2420); and an HIV risk reduction intervention study (N\,=\,274). A clear replication (kappa\,=\,0.60) of the proposed types was found in only one sample by one standard of comparison. The failure of the three personality types to replicate in three of the four samples leads to the conclusion that they are not robust empirical entities. Type membership predicted psychosocial functioning and ego resiliency and control, but only because it summarized trait standing; dimensional trait measures were consistently better predictors. Nevertheless, while the types do not refer to distinct, homogeneous classes of persons, they do have utility as convenient labels summarizing combinations of traits that relate to important outcomes.

The goal is to plot the landscape of current published empirical and theoretical studies that deal with the role of personality in software engineering. We applied the systematic review method to search and select published articles, and to extract and synthesize data from the selected articles that reported studies about personality. Our search retrieved more than 19,000 articles, from which we selected 90 articles published between 1970 and 2010. Nearly 72\% of the studies were published after 2002 and 83\% of the studies reported empirical research findings. Data extracted from the 90 studies showed that education and pair programming were the most recurring research topics, and that MBTI was the most used test. Research related to pair programming, education, team effectiveness, software process allocation, software engineer personality characteristics, and individual performance concentrated over 88\% of the studies, while team process, behavior and preferences, and leadership performance were the topics with the smallest number of studies. We conclude that the number of articles has grown in the last few years, but contradictory evidence was found that might have been caused by differences in context, research method, and versions of the tests used in the studies. While this raises a warning for practitioners that wish to use personality tests in practice, it shows several opportunities for the research community to improve and extend findings in this field.},

The NEO-PI Agreeableness score was correlated only with the thinking-feeling (T-F) dimension; the NEO-PI Conscientiousness score was correlated with both thinking-feeling and judging-perceiving (J-P) dimension; the NEO-PI Extraversion score was strongly correlated with the extraversion-introversion (E-I) dimensions, while the Neuroticism score from the NEO-PI was not related to any MBTI subscale score. The openness dimension was correlated with all four especially sensing-intuitive. These results were related to two other similar comparative studies.

We evaluated DeepMatcher with four open-source apps quantitatively and qualitatively. On average, DeepMatcher achieved a hit ratio of 0.71 and a Mean Average Precision of 0.55. For 91 problem reports, DeepMatcher did not find any matching bug report. When manually analyzing these 91 problem reports and the issue trackers of the studied apps, we found that in 47 cases, users actually described a problem before developers discovered and documented it in the issue tracker. We discuss our findings and different use cases for DeepMatcher.},

Nevertheless, re- sults from a recent survey study using the Ger- man version of the NEO-FFI [1] on a representa- tive population sample (n = 1908) have reported problems to replicate the factor structure of the instrument [3]. Insufficient psychometric indices of single items led to partly unsatisfactory scale values. A logical consequence of this was the de- velopment of a short version of the instrument with better psychometric properties. This article reports item and scale values of the NEO-FFI-30 for the German population sample. The five sca- les reach good internal consistency and are highly correlated with the original NEO-FFI scales. Furthermore, the influence of sociodemo- graphic variables and correlations with the Gie- \ss entest appear to be very similar for both the ori- ginal instrument and the short version. More- over, the factor structure was replicated in an in- dependent sample of 2508 adults. Results con- firm the reliability, and factor and construct vali- dity of this economic instrument without any significant loss in information.},

In software engineering, rationale management focuses on capturing design and requirements decisions and on organizing and reusing project knowledge. This paper takes a different view on rationale written by users in online reviews. We studied 32,414 reviews for 52 software applications in the Amazon Store. Through a grounded theory approach and peer content analysis, we investigated how users argue and justify their decisions, e.g. about upgrading, installing, or switching software applications. We also studied the occurrence frequency of rationale concepts such as issues encountered or alternatives considered in the reviews and found that assessment criteria like performance, compatibility, and usability represent the most pervasive concept. We then used the truth set of manually labeled review sentences to explore how accurately we can mine rationale concepts from the reviews. Support Vector Classifier, Naive Bayes, and Logistic Regression, trained on the review metadata, syntax tree of the review text, and influential terms, achieved a precision around 80\% for predicting sentences with alternatives and decisions, with top recall values of 98\%. On the review level, precision was up to 13\% higher with recall values reaching 99\%. We discuss the findings and the rationale importance for supporting deliberation in user communities and synthesizing the reviews for developers.},

We found that most of the feedback is provided shortly after new releases, with a quickly decreasing frequency over time. Reviews typically contain multiple topics, such as user experience, bug reports, and feature requests. The quality and constructiveness vary widely, from helpful advices and innovative ideas to insulting offenses. Feedback content has an impact on download numbers: positive messages usually lead to better ratings and vice versa.

The study population consisted of 159 employees of a pharmaceutical company. The NEO-Personality Inventory \textendash{} Revised and Performance Appraisal Questionnaire were used as measuring instruments. The results showed that Emotional Stability, Extraversion, Openness to Experience and Conscientiousness were related to task performance and creativity. Three personality dimensions, namely Emotional Stability, Openness to Experience and Agreeableness, explained 28\% of the variance in participants' management performance.},

  abstract = {Personalization of the user interface (UI) to certain individuals' characteristics is crucial for ensuring satisfaction with the service. Unfortunately, the attention in most UI personalization methods have been shifted from being behavioralpersonalization to self-personalization. Practically, we explored the potential of linking users' personality dimensions with their design preferences to shape the design of an interface. It is assumed that such design may effectively promote users' satisfaction with the service. A total of 87 participants were used to design the UI for certain personality types, and 50 students were used to evaluate their satisfaction with the UI. The results that UI designed based on the users' personality characteristics helped to stimulate their satisfaction in a mobile learning context. This study offers a new way for customizing the design of the interface based on the correlational link between individuals' preferences and the structure of personality characteristics.},

  abstract = {Smartphones enjoy high adoption rates around the globe. Rarely more than an arm's length away, these sensor-rich devices can easily be repurposed to collect rich and extensive records of their users' behaviors (e.g., location, communication, media consumption), posing serious threats to individual privacy. Here we examine the extent to which individuals' Big Five personality dimensions can be predicted on the basis of six different classes of behavioral information collected via sensor and log data harvested from smartphones. Taking a machine-learning approach, we predict personality at broad domain ([Formula: see text] = 0.37) and narrow facet levels ([Formula: see text] = 0.40) based on behavioral data collected from 624 volunteers over 30 consecutive days (25,347,089 logging events). Our cross-validated results reveal that specific patterns in behaviors in the domains of 1) communication and social behavior, 2) music consumption, 3) app usage, 4) mobility, 5) overall phone activity, and 6) day- and night-time activity are distinctively predictive of the Big Five personality traits. The accuracy of these predictions is similar to that found for predictions based on digital footprints from social media platforms and demonstrates the possibility of obtaining information about individuals' private traits from behavioral patterns passively collected from their smartphones. Overall, our results point to both the benefits (e.g., in research settings) and dangers (e.g., privacy implications, psychological targeting) presented by the widespread collection and modeling of behavioral data obtained from smartphones.},

Here, we seek to increase academic awareness of this incredibly popular idea and provide a novel teaching reference for its conceptual flaws. We focus on examining the validity of the Jungian-based theory behind MBTI that specifies that people have a ``true type'' delineated across four dichotomies. We find that the MBTI theory falters on rigorous theoretical criteria in that it lacks agreement with known facts and data, lacks testability, and possesses internal contradictions. We further discuss what MBTI's continued popularity says about how the general public might evaluate scientific theories.},

  abstract = {User feedback on mobile app stores, product forums, and on social media can contain product development insights. There has been a lot of recent research studying this feedback and developing methods to automatically extract requirement-related information. This feedback is generally considered to be the ``voice of the users''; however, only a subset of software users provide online feedback. If the demographics of the online feedback givers are not representative of the user base, this introduces the possibility of developing software that does not meet the needs of all users. It is, therefore, important to understand who provides online feedback to ensure the needs of under-represented groups are not being missed.In this work, we directly survey 1040 software users about their feedback habits, software use, and demographic information. Their responses indicate that there are statistically significant differences in who gives feedback on each online channel, with respect to traditional demographics (gender, age, etc). We also identify key differences in what motivates software users to engage with each of the three channels. Our findings provide valuable context for requirements elicited from online feedback and show that considering information from all channels will provide a more comprehensive view of user needs.},

  abstract = {Crowdsourcing is an appealing concept for achieving good enough requirements and just-in-time requirements engineering (RE). A promising form of crowdsourcing in RE is the use of feedback on software systems, generated through a large network of anonymous users of these systems over a period of time. Prior research indicated implicit and explicit user feedback as key to RE-practitioners to discover new and changed requirements and decide on software features to add, enhance, or abandon. However, a structured account on the types and characteristics of user feedback useful for RE purposes is still lacking. This research fills the gap by providing a mapping study of literature on crowdsourced user feedback employed for RE purposes. On the basis of the analysis of 44 selected papers, we found nine pieces of metadata that characterized crowdsourced user feedback and that were employed in seven specific RE activities. We also found that the published research has a strong focus on crowdgenerated comments (explicit feedback) to be used for RE purposes, rather than employing application logs or usage-generated data (implicit feedback). Our findings suggest a need to broaden the scope of research effort in order to leverage the benefits of both explicit and implicit feedback in RE.},
