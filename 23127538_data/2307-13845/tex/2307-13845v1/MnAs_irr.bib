The temperature range, spread around room temperature, and the maximal MCE position are markedly different in the two epitaxial systems. Simulated MCE curves, obtained from a model based on the mean-field approximation, are in good agreement with the experimental data, indicating that the entropy variation is magnetic in origin. These results illustrate how strain can be used to tune the MCE in materials with coupled structural and magnetic phase transition and suggest that the MCE of MnAs may find applications in microelectronic circuitry.},

   Abstract = {We have performed a systematic study of the bremsstrahlung emission from the electrons in the plasma of a commercial 14.5 GHz electron-cyclotron resonance ion source. The electronic spectral temperature and the product of ionic and electronic densities of the plasma are measured by analyzing the bremsstrahlung spectra recorded for several rare gases (Ar, Kr, and Xe)as a function of the injected power. Within our uncertainty, we find an average temperature of 48 keV above 100 W, with a weak dependency on the injected power and gas composition. Charge state distributions of extracted ion beams have been determined as well, providing a way to disentangle the ionic density from the electronic density. Moreover x-ray emission from highly charged argon ions in the plasma has been observed with a high-resolution mosaic-crystal spectrometer, demonstrating the feasibility for high-precision measurements of transition energies of highly charged ions, in particular, of the magnetic dipole (M1) transition of He-like of argon ions.},

   Abstract = {The alpha-beta magnetostructural phase transition in MnAs/GaAs(111) epilayers is investigated by elastic neutron scattering. The in-plane parameter of MnAs remains almost constant with temperature from 100 to 420 K, following the thermal evolution of the GaAs substrate. This induces a temperature dependent biaxial strain that is responsible for an alpha-beta phase coexistence and, more importantly, for the stabilization of the ferromagnetic alpha phase at a higher temperature than in the bulk. We explain the premature appearance of the beta phase at 275 K and the persistence of the ferromagnetic alpha phase up to 350 K with thermodynamical arguments based on the MnAs phase diagram. It results that the biaxial strain in the hexagonal plane is the key parameter to extend the ferromagnetic phase well over room temperature.},
