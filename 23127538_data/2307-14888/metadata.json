  "abstract": "Future Higgs Factories will allow the precise study of $e^{-}e^{+}\\rightarrow q\\bar{q}$ with $q=s,c,b,t$ interactions at different energies, from the Z-pole up to high energies never reached before. In this contribution, we will discuss the experimental prospects for the measurement of differential observables in $e^{-}e^{+}\\rightarrow b\\bar{b}$ and $e^{-}e^{+}\\rightarrow c\\bar{c}$ processes at high energies, 250 and 500 GeV, using full simulation samples and the full reconstruction chain from the ILD concept group. These processes call for superb primary and secondary vertex measurements, a high tracking efficiency to correctly measure the vertex charge and excellent hadron identification capabilities using $dE/dx$. This latter aspect will be discussed in detail together with its implementation within the standard flavour tagging tools developed for ILD (LCFI+). In addition, prospects associated with potential improvements using cluster counting techniques instead of traditional $dE/dx$ will be discussed.",
