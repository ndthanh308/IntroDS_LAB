\section{Experimental prospects for \Afb  and \Rq at ILC250 and ILC500}
\label{sec:results}

Three different scenarios have been studied: reconstruction without TPC kaon ID, a reconstruction using TPC Kaon ID (via \dEdx) for charge measurement as well as adding \dEdx in the flavour tagging and a reconstruction using TPC Kaon ID (via \dNdx) for charge measurement as well as adding \dNdx in the flavour tagging, being the later an estimation as described in section \ref{dNdxsection}. These three scenarios are covered for both 250 and 500 GeV, for the cases of $P_{\mathrm{e^{-}e^{+}}}=(-0.8,+0.3)$ and $P_{\mathrm{e^{-}e^{+}}}=(+0.8,-0.3)$. A comparison for each case using only statistical uncertainties has also been plotted. The results are summarised in Fig. \ref{fig:results}.
