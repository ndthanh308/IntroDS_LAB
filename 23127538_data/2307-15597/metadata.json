  "abstract": "Beamstrahlung is a dominant effect in the beam dynamics of the high luminosity next-generation lepton collider FCC-ee. We characterize the beamstrahlung radiation for the beam parameters at the four working energies, from the Z-pole to the $t\\bar{t}$ threshold, and present the effect of this radiation in the Machine-Detector-Interface region. We discuss the conceptual need for a photon dump due to the high power produced, which is in the order of hundreds of kilowatts. We also discuss the detector induced backgrounds due to the incoherent $e^+e^-$ pairs produced by the interaction of the beamstrahlung photons at the IP.",
