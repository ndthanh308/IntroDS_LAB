  "abstract": "A generalized $t$-pyramid is a graph obtained from a certain kind of tree (a subdivided star or a subdivided cubic caterpillar) and the line graph of a subdivided cubic caterpillar by identifying simplicial vertices. We prove that for every integer $t$ there exists a constant $c(t)$ such that every $n$-vertex even-hole-free graph with no clique of size $t$ and no induced subgraph isomorphic to a generalized $t$-pyramid has treewidth at most $c(t)\\log{n}$. This settles a special case of a conjecture of Sintiari and Trotignon; this bound is also best possible for the class. It follows that several \\textsf{NP}-hard problems such as \\textsc{Stable Set}, \\textsc{Vertex Cover}, \\textsc{Dominating Set} and \\textsc{Coloring} admit polynomial-time algorithms on this class of graphs. Results from this paper are also used in later papers of the series, in particular to solve the full version of the Sintiari-Trotignon conjecture.",
