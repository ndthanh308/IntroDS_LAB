  "abstract": "Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) are affected by solar modulation while they propagate through the heliosphere. The study of the time variation of GCR spectra observed at Earth can shed light on the underlying physical processes, specifically diffusion and particle drifts. We combine a state-of-the art 3D numerical model of GCR transport in the heliosphere with a neural-network-accelerated Markov chain Monte Carlo to constrain the rigidity and time dependence of the global transport coefficients, using precise GCR data from the PAMELA and AMS-02 experiments between 2006 and 2019.",
