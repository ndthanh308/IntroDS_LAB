  "abstract": "The probabilities of $xn$-, $pxn$-, and $αxn$-evaporation channels in excited superheavy nuclei were evaluated using the Monte Carlo method. The calculations utilized microscopically determined nuclear level densities and were compared with results obtained from the phenomenological Jackson formula. Effective temperatures derived from the microscopic approach were incorporated into the Jackson formula for different evaporation channels at low and moderate excitation energies. Additionally, an analytical formula was introduced to estimate the average kinetic energy of emitted particles in multi-step processes.",
