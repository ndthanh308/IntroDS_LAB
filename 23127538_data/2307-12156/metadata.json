  "abstract": "Multiple operational constraints of power system stability are derived analytically and reformulated into Second-Order Cone (SOC) form through a unification method in Part I of this paper. The accuracy and conservativeness of the proposed methods are illustrated in the second part. The validity of the developed constraints is tested against dynamic simulations carried out based on the modified IEEE 39-bus system. Furthermore, the developed power system stability constraints are applied to the optimal system scheduling model. The resulting stability-constrained system scheduling problem aims to achieve most economic system operation while ensuring different stability in power systems with high Inverter-Based Resources (IBR) penetration. Moreover, based on the stability-constrained optimization model, a novel marginal unit pricing scheme is proposed to quantify the stability services of different units appropriately according to their economic value in maintaining system stability, thus providing rational incentives to the stability service provider and insightful information for the stability market development.",
