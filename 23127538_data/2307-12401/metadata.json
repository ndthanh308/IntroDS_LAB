  "abstract": "It was conjectured by Goyal, Shukla and Singh that the independence complex of the categorical product $K_2\\times K_3\\times K_n$ has the homotopy type of a wedge of $(n-1)(3n-2)$ spheres of dimension $3$. Here we prove this conjecture by calculating the homotopy type of the independence complex of the graphs $C_{3r}\\times K_n$ and $K_2\\times K_m\\times K_n$. For $C_m \\times K_n$ when $m$ is not a multiple of $3$, we calculate the homotopy type for $m = 4, 5$ and show that for other values it has to have the homotopy type of a wedge of spheres of at most $2$ consecutive dimensions and maybe some Moore spaces.",
