  "abstract": "Building upon the foundational work of Thomas and Williams on the modular sweep map, Garsia and Xin have developed a straightforward algorithm for the inversion of the sweep map on rational $(m,n)$-Dyck paths, where $(m,n)$ represents coprime pairs of integers. Our research reveals that their innovative approach readily generalizes to encompass a broader spectrum of Dyck paths. To this end, we introduce a family of Order sweep maps applicable to general Dyck paths, which are differentiated by their respective sweep orders at level $0$. We demonstrate that each of these Order sweep maps constitutes a bijective transformation. Our findings encapsulate the sweep maps for both general Dyck paths and their incomplete counterparts as specific instances within this more extensive framework.",
