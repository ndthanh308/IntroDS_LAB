\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we present a novel framework that can achieve diverse image inpainting and editing with GAN inversion.
To the best of our knowledge, our framework is the first one that can achieve those simultaneously. 
We present an extensive ablation study to show the effectiveness of our contributions. Our comparisons with competing methods show that 
we achieve significantly better scores than previous works both in terms of diversity and quality.
