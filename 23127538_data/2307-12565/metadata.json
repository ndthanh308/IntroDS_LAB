  "abstract": "In this talk, recent measurements of charmonium decays of BESIII are presented. Using 448 million $ψ(3686)$ events collected with the BESIII detector, the branching fractions of the decays $χ_{cJ} \\to φφ(J=0,1,2)$ have been measured most precisely, and the polarization parameters of $χ_{cJ} \\to φφ$ have been determined for the first time via a helicity amplitude analysis. Using the same data sample as in the previous study, first evidence of $η_c(2S) \\to π^+ π^- η$ has been found in the decay sequence $ψ(3686) \\to γη_c(2S)(\\to π^+ π^- η)$. The product of the branching fractions of $ψ(3686) \\to γη_c(2S)$ and $η_c(2S) \\to π^+ π^- η$ is reported as well as the individual branching fraction of $η_c(2S) \\to π^+ π^- η$. The process $e^+ e^- \\to ηJ/ψ$ at a center-of-mass energy $3.773~{\\rm GeV}$ is observed for the first time. Its Born cross-section is measured, and the branching fraction of $ψ(3770) \\to ηJ/ψ$ is determined by a combined fit with the cross sections at other energy points, after considering the interference effect for the first time. Utilizing 2708 million $ψ(3686)$ events collected by the BESIII detector, the decays $χ_{cJ} \\to Ω^- \\barΩ^+(J=0,1,2)$ have been observed for the first time with high significance via the radiative decays of $ψ(3686) \\to γχ_{cJ}$. The relevant branching fractions have been provided.",
