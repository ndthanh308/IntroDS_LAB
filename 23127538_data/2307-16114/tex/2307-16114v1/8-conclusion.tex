\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we presented \system{}, a novel mixed reality interface that augments holographic telepresence through synchronized tabletop mobile robots. With \system{}, we demonstrated that the remote users can physically engage with local users and the environment, enabling them to touch, grasp, manipulate, and interact with tangible objects as if they were co-located in the same space. This paper expands upon existing physical telepresence by presenting more comprehensive design space and interaction techniques, such as object actuation, virtual hand physicalization, miniature body interaction, shared tangible interfaces, embodied guidance, and haptic communication. We demonstrated various applications for \system{}, such as physical storytelling, remote tangible gaming, and hands-on instruction. A user study with twelve participants revealed that \system{} significantly enhances co-presence and shared experiences in mixed reality remote collaboration, proving its scalability, deployability, and generalizability for a wide range of remote tangible collaboration scenarios.
Additionally, we have outlined several potential avenues for future work that could extend the design space and uncover new opportunities for \system{}.
