Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools such as KiCad offer powerful functionalities but remain difficult to use, particularly for beginners, due to their steep learning curves and fragmented documentation. To address this challenge, we present SmartonAI, an AI-assisted interaction system that integrates large language models into the EDA workflow, enabling natural language communication, intelligent task decomposition, and contextual plugin execution. SmartonAI consists of two main components: a Chat Plugin that breaks down user instructions into subtasks and retrieves tailored documentation, and a OneCommandLine Plugin that recommends and executes relevant plugins based on user intent. The system supports multilingual interaction and adapts to user feedback through incremental learning. Preliminary results suggest that SmartonAI significantly reduces onboarding time and enhances productivity, representing a promising step toward generalizable AI-assisted interaction paradigms for complex software systems.
