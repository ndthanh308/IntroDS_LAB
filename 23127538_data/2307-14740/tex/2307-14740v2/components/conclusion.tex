\section{Conclusion}

In this work, we present \textbf{SmartonAI}, an intelligent assistant that augments Electronic Design Automation (EDA) workflows through retrieval-augmented generation, modular agent design, and interactive plugin execution within the KiCad ecosystem. By leveraging a hybrid LLM backend and document-grounded reasoning, SmartonAI effectively bridges the gap between natural language queries and executable design actions.

Through comprehensive experiments and qualitative feedback, we demonstrate the system’s ability to decompose complex multi-turn instructions, recommend relevant tools, and dynamically adapt its behavior to user intent. The integration of DocHelper enables fine-grained retrieval from structured documentation, reducing cognitive load and enhancing usability in practical design scenarios.

While current evaluations focus on KiCad, the underlying architecture is extensible to other EDA platforms via API adapters and domain-specific retrievers. Future work will involve fine-tuning with real user interaction traces, scaling to multimodal inputs (e.g., schematics or layout previews), and conducting large-scale user studies to quantify impact on productivity and decision support.

Our findings suggest that SmartonAI offers a promising paradigm for embedding conversational intelligence directly into professional design tools, thereby enabling more accessible, efficient, and context-aware EDA experiences.
