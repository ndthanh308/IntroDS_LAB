  "abstract": "We construct new stabilizer quantum error-correcting codes from generalized monomial-Cartesian codes. Our construction uses an explicitly defined twist vector, and we present formulas for the minimum distance and dimension. Generalized monomial-Cartesian codes arise from polynomials in $m$ variables. When $m=1$ our codes are MDS, and when $m=2$ and our lower bound for the minimum distance is $3$ the codes are at least Hermitian Almost MDS. For an infinite family of parameters when $m=2$ we prove that our codes beat the Gilbert-Varshamov bound. We also present many examples of our codes that are better than any known code in the literature.",
