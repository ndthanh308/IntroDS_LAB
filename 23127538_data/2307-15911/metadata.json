  "abstract": "This work explores entanglement-assisted communication, where quantum entanglement resources enable the transmission of classical information at an enhanced rate. We consider a scenario where entanglement is distributed ahead of time based on network traffic levels, and simulate a setting where idle nodes generate and store entanglement to later transmit messages at an accelerated rate. We analyze this communication model using noise models for quantum memory in various scenarios, and extend our investigation to a quantum-enhanced distributed computing environment, where entanglement storage enhances data transmission rates for cooperative data processing. We propose a protocol and demonstrate a distributed version of unsupervised clustering. Our results show that, for qubit channels, high rates of entanglement generation and modest storage requirements can surpass the classical limit with entanglement assistance.",
