\subsection{Additional Information on Evaluation}
\label{app:additional-info-eval}

\subsubsection{Additional Information and Results for Table~\ref{tab:main}}

Each cell corresponds to 200 evaluated examples (except for ``annotator pref.,'' we first do 100 annotations, and then do the second 100 annotations only for rows with large enough ``new wins'' minus ``baseline wins'' value -- the ``length ($k$=20)'' row and the sentiment-/joy-related rows). The significance test is done with Wilcoxon signed-rank test.

We also collected human annotations for generations corresponding to ``ranked by probability'' vs. generations corresponding to the ``length ($k$=20)'' signal and the ``joy \& length'' signal. The results (``ranked by prob'' wins / new wins / tie) for the ``length ($k$=20)'' signal: 29.5 / 37.0 / 33.5 (*). The results for the ``joy \& length'' signal: 29.0 / 33.0 / 38.0 (--).

Finally, we complement the Table~\ref{tab:main} results with the LLM-evaluated pairwise preference results, as shown in Table~\ref{tab:llm-results-main}. As discussed in \S\ref{sec:eval-methods}, while instance-level LLM vs. expert agreement is not high, we find general agreement between LLM evaluation results (as shown in Table~\ref{tab:llm-results-main}) and the crowdworker evaluation results when averaging over 200 examples.


\begin{table*}[ht!]

See \S\ref{sec:eval-methods}. 200 examples are evaluated in each row. Sig.: ** if $p$-value $\in [0, 0.05)$, * if $p$-value $\in [0.05, 0.1)$, -- otherwise. See \S\ref{app:additional-info-eval} for more info. % \pang{Edit}

\label{tab:llm-results-main}
\end{table*}





\subsubsection{Additional Information and Results for Table~\ref{tab:properties}}
\label{app:additional-info-properties}

If we remove our generations that are off-topic, controversial, unfriendly, insincere, and only evaluate on the rest of the examples, then the human annotation would prefer our implicit feedback model generations more: the ``baseline generation wins'' vs. ``new generation wins'' vs. ``tie'' proportion would be 31.6 / 47.5 / 20.9 for the ``length ($k$=20)'' signal (better than the 31.0 / 43.0 / 26.0 result in Table~\ref{tab:main}), and 24.5 / 41.3 / 34.2 for the ``joy \& length'' signal (better than the 27.0 / 36.5 / 36.5 result in Table~\ref{tab:main}).

\subsubsection{Agreement of Expert, Annotator, and Auto-Evaluation Results}
\label{app:agreement}

Initially, we have conducted evaluation using LLM, hoping to save cost. 
The rationale is two-fold: first, model-based evaluation (especially with in-context CoT examples) 
has shown to perform well on a range of tasks \citep{gilardi2023chatgpt} and crowdsourcers might already rely on LLMs \citep{veselovsky2023artificial}; second, the cost is much lower than human evaluation. However, the LLM--expert agreement is low. Table~\ref{tab:expert-machine} shows that 64.5\% of the answers match,\footnote{Both LLM and experts choose ``(a) is better'' or both choose ``(b) is better'' or both choose ``(a) and (b) tie.''} and 14\% strongly disagree (defined as LLM choosing ``(a) is better'' and experts choosing ``(b) is better,'' or LLM choosing ``(b) is better'' and experts choosing ``(a) is better''). We thus need to rely on crowdworker evaluation.

\begin{table}[ht!]
\setlength{\tabcolsep}{2.1pt}
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
    \toprule
    & \makecell[c]{baseline gen \\ wins \\ (LLM)} & \makecell[c]{new gen \\ wins \\ (LLM)} & \makecell[c]{tie \\ (LLM)}\\
    \midrule
    baseline gen wins (experts) & 21 & 7 & 2\\
    \makecell[l]{new gen wins (experts)} & 7 & 30 & 1.5\\
    tie (experts) & 6.5 & 11.5 & 13.5\\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Confusion table of LLM evaluations vs. expert evaluations. `Gen' stands for `generation.' 64.5\% annotations match; 14\% annotations strongly disagree (as defined in \S\ref{sec:eval-methods}, the \% of annotations that strongly disagree equals the \% of LLM choosing ``baseline gen wins'' and experts choosing ``new gen wins'' plus the \% of LLM choosing ``new gen wins'' and experts choosing ``baseline gen wins''). We see from this table that the LLM--expert match is not satisfactory.  
}
\label{tab:expert-machine}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[ht!]
\setlength{\tabcolsep}{2.1pt}
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
    \toprule
    & \makecell[c]{baseline gen \\ wins \\ (LLM)} & \makecell[c]{new gen \\ wins \\ (LLM)} & \makecell[c]{tie \\ (LLM)}\\
    \midrule
    baseline gen wins (annotators) & 17 & 10 & 3\\
    \makecell[l]{new gen wins (annotators)} & 10.5 & 26 & 2.5\\
    tie (annotators) & 7 & 12.5 & 11.5\\
    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Confusion table of LLM evaluations vs. annotator evaluations. `Gen' stands for `generation.' 54.5\% annotations match; 20.5\% strongly disagree. We see from this table that the LLM--annotator match is not high. 
}
\label{tab:annotator-machine}
\end{table}

We see in Table~\ref{tab:expert-annotator} that the expert--annotator agreement is much higher: 86\% of annotations match, and only 6.5\% of annotations strongly disagree. 

\begin{table}[ht!]
\setlength{\tabcolsep}{2.1pt}

    \bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Confusion table of expert evaluations vs. annotator evaluations. `Gen' stands for `generation.' 86\% annotations match; 6.5\% strongly disagree. This agreement is better than the LLM--expert agreement or the LLM--annotator agreement.

\subsubsection{Details on Auto-Evaluation}
\label{app:prompts}

As discussed in \S\ref{sec:eval-methods}, by using the following prompts (except for the pairwise comparison evaluation corresponding to Table~\ref{tab:expert-machine}), the LLM--expert agreement is $>$90\%, potentially because the questions are straightforward intuitively. 

\paragraph{Seeking info.} The following prompt is used when evaluating whether the bot is seeking information. The prompt contains eight in-context examples with chain-of-thought reasoning.

% 

\paragraph{Controversial.} As a reminder, for each evaluation objective, we first attempt zero-shot prompting to see if the human-LLM annotation match (on 50 randomly selected examples) is $>$ 90\%. If not, then we use 8-shot chain-of-thought prompting (and we find that all of the human-LLM annotation match is $>$ 90\% after 8-shot chain-of-thought prompting). For evaluating whether a generation is controversial, we find that the zero-shot prompting results already match with human annotations $> 90\%$ of the time. Therefore, we adopt the following straightforward prompt.
\begin{quote}
\scriptsize
Read the conversation below. \\
SPEAKER 1: [utterance] \\
SPEAKER 2: [utterance] \\
... \\
SPEAKER 1: [utterance]

Answer the following question regarding the last response by SPEAKER 1 ([copying the last response here]). \\
Does this response contain anything controversial? Answer in yes or no, and explain why or why not.
\end{quote}


\paragraph{Insincere.} Next, we evaluate whether the bot response is insincere and whether the bot response is unfriendly by using the prompt below. The prompt contains eight in-context examples with chain-of-thought reasoning.
\begin{quote}
\scriptsize
Read the conversation below.\\
SPEAKER 1: How is your dog doing?\\
SPEAKER 2: I don't have a dog. \\
SPEAKER 1: I see. Do you want one?\\
SPEAKER 2: Who knows... You need to walk them.\\
SPEAKER 1: So??? \\
Is the last response insincere (i.e., being deceitful or not being genuine or not being serious about the conversation)?

(a) Reasoning: In the last response, Speaker 1 seems confused, and does not understand why walking dogs is a factor for not getting one. However, the feeling is genuine and Speaker 1 is not trying to deceive Speaker 2.\\
(b) Answer: No.


Read the conversation below.\\
SPEAKER 1: Do you have any travel plans for the summer?\\
SPEAKER 2: I travelled a bunch already earlier this year!\\
SPEAKER 1: That's great. Where do you wanna go next? \\
SPEAKER 2: New York maybe\\
SPEAKER 1: What's New York? Tell me more about it! I'd be curious to hear!
Is the last response insincere (i.e., being deceitful or not being genuine)?

(a) Reasoning: The last response asks what New York is, but it is unlikely Speaker 1 never heard of New York. It is likely that Speaker 1 is not being genuine to make Speaker 2 engage more in the conversation. \\
(b) Answer: Yes.


Read the conversation below.\\
SPEAKER 1: What are you thinking about?\\
SPEAKER 2: The conductor for Chicago Symphony Orchestra is retiring.\\

(b) Answer: No. 


Read the conversation below.\\
SPEAKER 1: What are you thinking of?\\
SPEAKER 2: Tell me a Metallica joke. \\
SPEAKER 1: How many times have you heard the phrase "joke's on you"? Probably too many times to count! Lol\\
SPEAKER 2: Tell me another Metallica joke. \\
SPEAKER 1: Okay, one last one and then we'll move on to something else... What did the farmer say when he lost his tractor?\\
SPEAKER 2: What?\\
SPEAKER 1: Sorry, I don't know.  Tell me about some of your hobbies.\\
SPEAKER 2: Metallica 10/10\\
SPEAKER 1: Oh I don't really like their songs. Are you going to their concert? \\
SPEAKER 2: Yes absolutely\\
SPEAKER 1: I'm also hoping to go! I love them!\\
Is the last response insincere (i.e., being deceitful or not being genuine)?

SPEAKER 1: My thesis supervisor told me yesterday she received some feedback from her editor regarding my thesis proposal! She thinks there could be something there after all :) \\
SPEAKER 2: Um... I'm not going to downvote that, but it sounds like you're assuming the persona of a college student. That's fine if we want to role-play that, but I'd rather keep the conversation more down to earth. \\
SPEAKER 1: Whatever. keep doing you. \\

\paragraph{Comparison.} To compare between responses by two different models, we adopt the following prompt. The prompt contains eight in-context chain-of-thought examples.
\begin{quote}
\scriptsize
Read the conversation below and consider the two possible next responses -- named (a) and (b) -- by SPEAKER 1.

SPEAKER 1: What else is on your mind? \\
SPEAKER 2: Should we abolish the federal government? \\
SPEAKER 1: I'm not sure about that.  It would have to be replaced with something.  Perhaps just change it. \\
SPEAKER 2: What should you do if your government has become too powerful? \\
SPEAKER 1: Depends upon what you want to change.  Change management (sometimes abbreviated as CM) is a collective term for all approaches to prepare, support, and help individuals, teams, and organizations in making organizational change. \\
SPEAKER 2: I don't think that is correct.

(a): That's incorrect. A major theme in CM is to facilitate and support the adoption of new behaviors, practices, and ways of working. That is usually done by coaching. \\
(b): That's incorrect. A major theme in CM is to facilitate and support the adoption of new behaviors, practices, and ways of working. That is usually done by coaching.

As a reminder, (a) and (b) are two possible responses by SPEAKER 1. A response is considered good if it is sensible, engaging, and friendly. Which of the two responses from SPEAKER 1 is much better than the other one? If they are similarly good or bad, then answer “(c) tie.” 

Reasoning: The two responses are the same, so (a) and (b) are equally good or bad. \\
Answer: (c) tie

Read the conversation below and consider the two possible next responses -- named (a) and (b) -- by SPEAKER 1.

SPEAKER 1: Hey! I'm happy to chat about anything. What's on your mind? \\
SPEAKER 2: here is a paradox, this sentence is false

(a): What is a true paradox?  I have heard of one before.  You are one of those people who are always right, aren't you? \\
(b): Paradoxes are the hardest thing to deal with.  I don't like them at all.  But I love the fact that they are so hard to figure out.  Is that why you like them? 

As a reminder, (a) and (b) are two possible responses by SPEAKER 1. A response is considered good if it is sensible, engaging, and friendly. Which of the two responses from SPEAKER 1 is much better than the other one? If they are similarly good or bad, then answer “(c) tie.”

Reasoning: Both responses (a) and (b) engage with the topic and show interest in discussing paradoxes. In (a), Speaker 1 seems unfriendly. Response (b) seems to be more enthusiastic and demonstrates curiosity about the person's interest in paradoxes. Therefore, response (b) is better.  \\
Answer: (b) is better

Read the conversation below and consider the two possible next responses -- named (a) and (b) -- by SPEAKER 1.

SPEAKER 1: How are the job prospects going? \\
SPEAKER 2: I don't think that is correct. \\
SPEAKER 1: Oh, thanks for letting me know my response needs work! What should I have said instead? \\
SPEAKER 2: A casual greeting. Or share more about yourself \\
SPEAKER 1: Hi, what do you do for fun? I've lived in the city most of my life. \\
SPEAKER 2: What do you know about quantum physics? \\
SPEAKER 1: I like to learn about science and quantum physics sounds interesting. Do you know anything about it? Is it an interdisciplinary field? \\
SPEAKER 2: I only know what I hear online. But it's fascinating stuff. Do you know about JWST?

(a): I don;t. But you can look it up on youtube.    Do you like to cook? \\
(b): No. And I don't know what JWTS is. Do tell me more about it.

As a reminder, (a) and (b) are two possible responses by SPEAKER 1. A response is considered good if it is sensible, engaging, and friendly. Which of the two responses from SPEAKER 1 is much better than the other one? If they are similarly good or bad, then answer “(c) tie.”

Reasoning: Speaker 2 asks Speaker 1 if Speaker 1 knows about JWST. In (a), Speaker 1 tells Speaker 2 to look up JWST on youtube, but it’s very possible that Speaker 2 already knows about JWST. Additionally, bringing up cooking goes off-topic. In (b), there is a typo (JWTS should be JWST instead). But Speaker 1 honestly tells Speaker 2 of not knowing JWST, and it invites further conversation. So, (b) is better. \\
Answer: (b) is better.

Read the conversation below and consider the two possible next responses -- named (a) and (b) -- by SPEAKER 1.

SPEAKER 1: I don't know.  Have you watched any fun TV shows recently? \\
SPEAKER 2: I'll ask the questions. \\
SPEAKER 1: Sorry, I am just hungry.  Wanna talk about food?  Like honey?... Me too \\
SPEAKER 2: What is your phone number?

(a): No, but I know a guy who does.  Go get it!  [phone number removed] \\
(b): 555-Oh No. Do not do that. I'll report you to the cyber police.  No funny business!

As a reminder, (a) and (b) are two possible responses by SPEAKER 1. A response is considered good if it is sensible, engaging, and friendly. Which of the two responses from SPEAKER 1 is much better than the other one? If they are similarly good or bad, then answer “(c) tie.”

Reasoning: Speaker 2 asks Speaker 1 for the phone number. In (a), Speaker 1 gives Speaker 2 someone else’s phone number, which could be harmful to the person with the phone number. In (b), Speaker 1 threatens to report Speaker 2 to the police for asking for a phone number, which is unfriendly. If Speaker 1 doesn’t want to give out the number, a possible response would be to politely decline. Therefore, neither response is good.  \\
Answer: (c) tie

(a): That's great!! Pizza is the ultimate comfort food! Lol u just reminded me, I need to get some pizza for dinner!! \\
(b): That's definitely a must try! What else do u enjoy doing? Cooking, going out with friends, shopping?

As a reminder, (a) and (b) are two possible responses by SPEAKER 1. A response is considered good if it is sensible, engaging, and friendly. Which of the two responses from SPEAKER 1 is much better than the other one? If they are similarly good or bad, then answer “(c) tie.”

Reasoning: In (a), Speaker 1 shares the feeling with Speaker 2 of liking pizzas, which is great. In (b), Speaker 1 acknowledges Speaker 2's preference for greasy pizza and then asks a follow-up question about other things Speaker 2 enjoys doing. It shows interest in Speaker 2's preferences and invites further conversation and more engagement. So, response (b) is better.  \\
Answer: (b) is better

Read the conversation below and consider the two possible next responses -- named (a) and (b) -- by SPEAKER 1.

SPEAKER 1: Anything good? \\
SPEAKER 2: I think you would really like his manga “Astro Boy”. It’s a very famous piece about humanity and how they work together with robots towards a brighter future. \\
SPEAKER 1: Oh that sounds very interesting! Are there any particular editions of it that you recommend? Like hardback or paperback? \\
SPEAKER 2: So there are many volumes of it. It might be best to try the Omnibus Edition, since it collects more of the stories together into a slightly larger format.

(a): Ok thanks! I'll have to keep an eye out for it. I'll probably just get the paperback version. I hate hardback books. I like the soft feel. So the paperback is better? \\
(b): I might try that. I'm always happy to read more manga. I also love how some of the characters are voiced by the same voice actor.

As a reminder, (a) and (b) are two possible responses by SPEAKER 1. A response is considered good if it is sensible, engaging, and friendly. Which of the two responses from SPEAKER 1 is much better than the other one? If they are similarly good or bad, then answer “(c) tie.”

Reasoning: Speaker 2 recommends Speaker 1 a specific edition for a book. Response (a) directly addresses Speaker 2's recommendation and focuses on the specific details of purchasing the book, showing more interest and actively seeking advice. Response (b) is still a good response, but it veers slightly off-topic by mentioning the voice actors, which may distract from the main discussion about the book itself. Therefore, response (a) is better. \\
Answer: (a) is better

SPEAKER 1: Good job! Do you have kids? What do you do for fun? Anything interesting happen at work today? \\
SPEAKER 2: Yes and that’s why I came. It’s very interesting [link removed] \\
SPEAKER 1: Wow that is cool.. Thank you for sharing with me! Glad your kids will have something positive in their lives \\
SPEAKER 2: There is also more on quantum issues here I wanted to share What If Dark Energy Is A New Quantum Field? [link removed] \\
SPEAKER 1: Hey there, did you get a chance to look at that video about quantum computing yet? Or maybe take a look at that book on quantum mechanics too \\
SPEAKER 2: I could not find any specific info into the quantum issue you wanted me to take a look at . What was the name again ? 

(a): Quantum energy is the most interesting one I think, it is a new field of physics that is not well understood \\
(b): I could only find something about Dark Energy, it is a theory of gravitation that is a bit different than quantum mechanics

As a reminder, (a) and (b) are two possible responses by SPEAKER 1. A response is considered good if it is sensible, engaging, and friendly. Which of the two responses from SPEAKER 1 is much better than the other one? If they are similarly good or bad, then answer “(c) tie.”

Reasoning: Response (a) addresses Speaker 2's question by providing information about quantum energy as a new field of physics. It also expresses personal opinion by stating that it is the most interesting. Response (b) acknowledges Speaker 2's mention of dark energy but clarifies that it is a theory of gravitation rather than directly related to quantum mechanics. While this response provides some information, it may not fully address Speaker 2's question about the specific quantum issue. Therefore, (a) is more engaging and provides a clear and accurate explanation. \\
Answer: (a) is better.
