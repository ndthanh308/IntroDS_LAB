  "abstract": "In this manuscript we present the recently developed flexible framework for building both fluid and electron kinetic models of the tokamak Scrape-Off Layer in 1D - ReMKiT1D (Reactive Multi-fluid and Kinetic Transport in 1D). The framework can handle systems of non-linear ODEs, various 1D PDEs arising in fluid modelling, as well as PDEs arising from the treatment of the electron kinetic equation. As such, the framework allows for flexibility in fluid models of the Scrape-Off Layer while allowing the easy addition of kinetic electron effects. We focus on presenting both the high-level design decisions that allow for model flexibility, as well as the most important implementation aspects. A significant number of verification and performance tests are presented, as well as a step-by-step walkthrough of a simple example for setting up models using the Python interface.",
