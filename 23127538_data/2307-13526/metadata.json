  "abstract": "Theories in physics can provide a kind of map of the physical system under investigation, showing all of the possible types of behavior which may occur. Certain points on the map are of greater significance than others, because they describe how the system responds in a useful or interesting manner. For example, the point of resonance is of particular importance when timing the pushes onto a person sat on a swing. More sophisticatedly, so-called exceptional points have been shown to be significant in optical systems harbouring both gain and loss, as typically described by non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. However, expressly quantum points of interest -- be they exceptional points or otherwise -- arising in quantum photonic systems have been far less studied. Here we consider a paradigmatic model: a pair of coupled qubits subjected to an unbalanced ratio of gain and loss. We mark on its map several flavours of both exceptional and critical points, each of which are associated with unconventional physical responses. In particular, we uncover the points responsible for characteristic spectral features and for the sudden loss of quantum entanglement in the steady state. Our results provide perspectives for characterizing quantum photonic systems beyond effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, and suggest a hierarchy of intrinsically quantum points of interest.",
