	abstract = {Among various components commonly used in redox flow batteries (RFBs), the separator plays a significant role, influencing resistance to current as well as capacity decay via unintended crossover. It is well-established that the ohmic overpotential is dominated by the membrane and interfacial resistance in most aqueous RFBs. The ultimate goal of engineering membranes is to improve the ionic conductivity while keeping crossover at a minimum. One of the major issues yet to be addressed is the contribution of interfacial phenomena in the influence of ionic and water transport through the membrane. In this work, we have utilized a novel experimental system capable of measuring the ionic crossover in real-time to quantify the permeability of ionic species. Specifically, we have focused on quantifying the contributions from the interfacial resistance to ionic crossover. The trade-off between the mass and ionic transport impedance caused by the interface of the membranes has been addressed. The MacMullin number has been quantified for a series of electrolyte configurations and a correlation between the ionic conductivity of the contacting electrolyte and the Nafion® membrane has been established. The performance of individual ion-exchange membranes along with a stack of various separators have been explored. We have found that utilizing a stack of membranes is significantly beneficial in reducing the electroactive species crossover in redox flow batteries compared to a single membrane of the same fold thickness. For example, we have demonstrated that the utilization of five layers of Nafion® 211 membrane reduces the crossover by 37\% while only increasing the area-specific resistance (ASR) by 15\% compared to a single layer Nafion® 115 membrane. Therefore, the influence of interfacial impedance in reducing the vanadium ion crossover is substantially higher compared to a corresponding increase in ASR, indicating that mass and ohmic interfacial resistances are dissimilar. We have expanded our analysis to a combination of commercially available ion-exchange membranes and provided a design chart for membrane selection based on the application of interest (short duration/high-performance vs. long-term durability). The results of this study provide a deeper insight into the optimization of all-vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs).},

Despite previous attempts, there is still need for robust and thoroughly validated models. Here, a steady-state two-dimensional unit-cell model of an all-vanadium redox flow battery is presented. The model integrates state-of-the-art descriptions of the fundamental physical phenomena, along with new features such as local mass transfer coefficients for each active species, precise sulfuric acid dissociation kinetics, and experimental data of the electrochemical parameters and electrolyte properties. The model is validated at different states of charge and flow rates using polarization, conductivity and open circuit voltage measurements. Then, the contribution of operating conditions on battery performance is studied by analyzing its separate effect on the various phenomena that affect cell performance, such as local pore mass transfer limitations, parasitic hydrogen evolution reactions, crossover and self-discharge fluxes. The resulting model is a reliable tool that can be used to assess the relevance of these coupled phenomena that take place simultaneously within the reaction cell. This important information is critical to optimize cell components, reactor design and to select optimal operating conditions.},

Computational and experimental investigations reveal insights on the possible interactions between the vanadium ions in all oxidation states and sulphate, bisulphate, dihydrogen phosphate ions and phosphoric acid. In situ cycling experiments and ion-specific electrochemical impedance measurements confirmed a significant lowering of the charge-transfer resistance for the reduction of V(iii) ions and, consequently, an increase of the voltaic efficiency associated with the negative side of the battery. This increase of performance is attributable to the complexation of this oxidation state by phosphoric acid. So far, mixed acids have mainly been discussed with the focus on V(v) solubility. In this work we rationalize the impact of the mixed acids on the electrochemical efficiency opening new strategies on how to improve the cycling performance with ionic additives.},

              Fast capacity decay is a serious problem in vanadium flow batteries (VFBs). How to eliminate or slow down capacity fading has become a critical issue for the practical application of VFBs. Herein, the concept of an asymmetric vanadium flow battery (aVFB) is introduced, in which the asymmetric design of a catholyte and an anolyte is used to suppress the capacity decay of the VFB. Based on the comprehensive analysis of the capacity decay and electrolyte imbalance process of the traditional symmetric VFB, it was found that the capacity fading is mainly owing to the loss of the anolyte in the long-term cycling test. Therefore, this work attempts to use excess anolyte (
              i.e.
              10\%, 20\% and 30\%) to mitigate the capacity decay during the long-term operation of the VFB. To gain deeper insights into the capacity retention mechanism of these novel anolyte overhang aVFBs, long-term cycle performance of the corresponding symmetric overhang VFBs and catholyte overhang aVFBs is investigated for comparison. The optimal excess ratio of anolyte and how to add the excess anolyte are also suggested for future study.},

A key step in the procedure is the use of an affinity gel prepared by coupling pteroyl-L-lysine to Sepharose. The purified reductase has a specific activity of about 100 units/mg and is homogeneous as judged by analytical ultracentrifugation, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, and titration with methotrexate. The products of the first step of Edman degradation indicated a minimum purity of 79\%. The reductase has a molecular weight of about 21500 on the basis of amino acid composition and 22100 +/- 300 from equilibrium sedimentation. It is not inhibited by antiserum to the Streptococcus faecium reductase (isoenzyme 2). Unlike the reductase of many other vertebrate tissues, the bovine enzyme is inhibited by mercurials rather than activated and it has a single pH optimum at both low and high ionic strength. However, the position of the pH optimum is shifted and the activity increased by increasing ionic strength. Automatic Edman degradation has been used to determine 34 of the amino-terminal 37 amino acid residues. Considerable homology exists between this region and the corresponding regions of the reductase from S. faecium and from Escherichia coli. This strengthens the idea that this region contributes to the structure of the binding site for dihydrofolate.},

With appropriate calibration, parameters such as the state of charge (SOC) of the electrolytes can be calculated. The system offers a tool for further research on the complex relationships between the spectra and the composition of the electrolyte in a VRB, and provides a dynamic method to study the kinetics of the electrolyte imbalance in VRBs.},

This study investigates a simple and effective technique for the recovery of capacity loss arising from symmetrical mechanisms via automatic electrolyte rebalancing. However, chemical or electrochemical techniques must be used to mitigate capacity loss from asymmetrical mechanisms (e.g., air oxidation of V2+), which requires knowledge of the oxidation states present in the electrolytes. As such, this study assesses the suitability of SOC tracking via electrolyte absorption for independent monitoring of the anolyte and catholyte within an existing VRFB system. Testing is performed over cycling of a 40 cell, 2.5 kW with 40 L of electrolyte. Optical monitoring is performed using a custom-made flow cell with optical paths (interior cavity thicknesses) ranging from 1/4″ to 1/16″. Light transmitted through the cell by a 550 lumen white light source is monitored by a simple photodiode. The electrolyte rebalancing mechanism displayed success in recovering symmetrical capacity losses, while optical monitoring was unsuccessful due to the high absorbance of the electrolyte. Potential improvements to the monitoring system are presented to mitigate this issue.},
