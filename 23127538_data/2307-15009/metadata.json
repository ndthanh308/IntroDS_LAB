  "abstract": "This paper presents an exhaustive how-to guide on measuring the total vanadium concentration and state of charge of vanadium electrolytes using UV-Visible spectroscopy. The study is provided with an open-access database (https://github.com/AngeAM/SOC_Vanadium_Spectra_2023.git) that supports the methods and procedures and facilitates access to the calibration data. The study covers the three types of electrolyte solutions relevant to vanadium redox flow batteries, namely the anolyte $V^{II}/V^{III}$, the catholyte $V^{IV}V^V$, and the $V^{III}/V^{IV}$ commercial electrolyte, meant to be preconditioned to either $V^{III}$ or $V^{IV}$ before battery operation. Analytical expressions to calculate the concentration of different vanadium species in the electrolyte solutions are provided based on either empirical correlations or spectral deconvolution methods. The paper also examines the limitations of the measurement technique and provides insightful recommendations for future research. The open-access database provided by the authors is expected to serve as a valuable repository for scholars and scientists working in the field of vanadium redox flow batteries.",
