  "abstract": "Practical realizations of quantum repeaters require quantum memory simultaneously providing high retrieval efficiency, long lifetime and multimode storages. So far, the combination of high retrieval efficiency and spatially multiplexed storages into a single memory remains challenging. Here, we set up a ring cavity that supports an array including 6 TEM00 modes and then demonstrated cavity enhanced and spatially multiplexed spin wave photon quantum interface (QI). The cavity arrangement is according to Fermat' optical theorem, which enables the six modes to experience the same optical length per round trip. Each mode includesn horizontal and vertical polarizations. Via DLCZ process in a cold atomic ensemble, we create non classically correlated pairs of spin waves and Stokes photons in the 12 modes. The retrieved fields from the multiplexed SWs are enhanced by the cavity and the average intrinsic retrieval efficiency reaches 70% at zero delay. The storage time for the case that cross-correlation function of the multiplexed QI is beyond 2 reaches 0.6ms .",
