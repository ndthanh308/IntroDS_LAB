  "abstract": "A neutral delay differential equation (NDDE) model of a Kerr cavity with external coherent injection is developed that can be considered as a generalization of the Ikeda map with second and higher order dispersion being taken into account. It is shown that this model has solutions in the form of dissipative solitons both in the limit, where the model can be reduced to the Lugiato-Lefever equation (LLE), and beyond this limit, where the soliton is eventually destroyed by the Cherenkov radiation. Unlike the standard LLE the NDDE model is able to describe the overlap of multiple resonances associated with different cavity modes.",
