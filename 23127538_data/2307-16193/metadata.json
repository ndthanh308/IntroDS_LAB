  "abstract": "The underlying mechanisms and physics of catalytic Janus microswimmers is highly complex, requiring details of the associated phoretic fields and the physiochemical properties of catalyst, particle, boundaries, and the fuel used. Therefore, developing a minimal (and more general) model capable of capturing the overall dynamics of these autonomous particles is highly desirable. In the presented work, we demonstrate that a coarse-grained dissipative particle-hydrodynamics model is capable of describing the behaviour of various chemical microswimmer systems. Specifically, we show how a competing balance between hydrodynamic interactions experienced by a squirmer in the presence of a substrate, gravity, and mass and shape asymmetries can reproduce a range of dynamics seen in different experimental systems. We hope that our general model will inspire further synthetic work where various modes of swimmer motion can be encoded via shape and mass during fabrication, helping to realise the still outstanding goal of microswimmers capable of complex 3-D behaviour",
