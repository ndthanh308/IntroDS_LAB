  "abstract": "Let $M$ be the Hardy-Littlewood maximal function. Denote by $M_b$ and $[b,M]$ the maximal and the nonlinear commutators of $M$ with a function $b$. The boundedness of $M_b$ and $[b,M]$ on weighted Lebesgue spaces are characterized when the symbols $b$ belong to weighted Lipschitz (weighted Morrey-Campanato) spaces. Some new characterizations for weighted Lipschitz spaces are obtained. Similar results are also established for the nonlinear commutator of the sharp function.",
