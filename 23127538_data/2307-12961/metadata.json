  "abstract": "In Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ two transitions are observed, the main one to a ferromagnetic state at $T_C = 174$ K and the second one, involving in-plane components at $T_P = 127$ K. We follow their doping dependence as Sn is replaced with In, which causes a reduction of $T_C$ and $T_P$. Importantly, both transitions follow the same doping dependence, indicating a single energy scale involved with both processes.",
