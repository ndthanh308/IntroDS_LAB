  "abstract": "It is proven that, in any given base, there are infinitely many palindromic numbers having at most six prime divisors, each relatively large. The work involves equidistribution estimates for the palindromes in residue classes to large moduli, offering upper bounds for moments and averages of certain products closely related to exponential sums over palindromes",
