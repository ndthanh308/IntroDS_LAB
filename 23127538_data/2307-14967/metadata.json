  "abstract": "A search for quantum black holes in electron+jet and muon+jet invariant mass spectra is performed with 140 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected by the ATLAS detector in proton-proton collisions at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV at the Large Hadron Collider. The observed invariant mass spectrum of lepton+jet pairs is consistent with Standard Model expectations. Upper limits are set at 95% confidence level on the production cross-sections times branching fractions for quantum black holes decaying into a lepton and a quark in a search region with invariant mass above 2.0 TeV. The resulting quantum black hole lower mass threshold limit is 9.2 TeV in the Arkani-Hamed-Dimopoulos-Dvali model, and 6.8 TeV in the Randall-Sundrum model.",
