    Identifying Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) in its early stages is essential for establishing the beginning of treatment, enriching the outlook, and enhancing the overall well-being of those affected individuals. However, early diagnosis and detecting the disease's signs is not straightforward. A simpler and cheaper way arises by analyzing the patient's facial expressions through computational methods. When a patient with ALS engages in specific actions, e.g., opening their mouth, the movement of specific facial muscles differs from that observed in a healthy individual. This paper proposes Facial Point Graphs to learn information from the geometry of facial images to identify ALS automatically. The experimental outcomes in the Toronto Neuroface dataset show the proposed approach outperformed state-of-the-art results, fostering promising developments in the area.
