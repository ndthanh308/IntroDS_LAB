  "abstract": "In this paper, we study the Manin triples associated to $n$-Lie bialgebras. We introduce the concept of operad matrices for $n$-Lie bialgebras. In particular, by studying a special case of operad matrices, it leads to the notion of local cocycle $n$-Lie bialgebras. Furthermore, we establish a one-to-one correspondence between the double of $n$-Lie bialgebras and Manin triples of $n$-Lie algebras.",
