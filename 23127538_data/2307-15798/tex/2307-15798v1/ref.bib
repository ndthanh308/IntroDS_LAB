  abstract="Navigating multiple robots across a terrain to achieve their individual goals is a challenging research problem and has been addressed by incorporating a myriad of soft computing techniques. This article discusses this problem from the perspective of enacting a group coordination strategy among a group of robots. Such a scheme can go a long way in paving the path for quick and automatic disaster recovery through sharing critical information. Experiments have been carried out with four groups of robots with their respective sources and destinations and varying the number of robots between 8 to 20 with a novel game-theoretic group coordination strategy. Results obtained using the proposed approach have been compared with those obtained by traditional Potential Field Method (PFM) and standard soft computing based strategy such as Genetic Algorithm-Fuzzy (GA-Fuzzy) for performance metrics, both individual as well as for group, traveling time and the obtained results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method.",

abstract = {This paper investigates a class of motion planning problems where multiple unicycle robots desire to safely reach their respective goal regions with minimal traveling times. We present a distributed algorithm which integrates decoupled optimal feedback planning and distributed conflict resolution. Collision avoidance and finite-time arrival at the goal regions are formally guaranteed. Further, the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is independent of the robot number. A set of simulations are conducted to verify the scalability and near-optimality of the proposed algorithm.}

abstract="Perfectly rational decision-makers maximize expected utility, but crucially ignore the resource costs incurred when determining optimal actions. Here we employ an axiomatic framework for bounded rational decision-making based on a thermodynamic interpretation of resource costs as information costs. This leads to a variational ``free utility'' principle akin to thermodynamical free energy that trades off utility and information costs. We show that bounded optimal control solutions can be derived from this variational principle, which leads in general to stochastic policies. Furthermore, we show that risk-sensitive and robust (minimax) control schemes fall out naturally from this framework if the environment is considered as a bounded rational and perfectly rational opponent, respectively. When resource costs are ignored, the maximum expected utility principle is recovered.",
