\caption{Comparison with related datasets. For each dataset, we report the number of scenes (\textit{\#Sc.}, which may be recorded from multiple (\textit{viewpoints}) at different resolution, contain varying amount and type of \textit{motions}, filmed either from the frontal position or from around the scene. Our dataset uniquely has multiple actors per scene (\textit{\#Act}) and duration (\emph{Dur}.) of several minutes. Our datased has a natural background (as opposed to a studio or dome), and provided foreground masks include not only actors but also objects they are interacting with. 
%Finally, our dataset is multimodal, containing audio from a large array of microphones.
