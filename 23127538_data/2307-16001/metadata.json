  "abstract": "In this paper, we analyze the operation of an Otto cycle heat machine driven by a non-interacting two-dimensional electron gas on a twisted geometry. We show that due to both the energy quantization on this structure and the adiabatic transformation of the number of complete twists per unit length of a helicoid, the machine performance in terms of output work, efficiency, and operation mode can be altered. We consider the deformations as in a spring, which is either compressed or stretched from its resting position. The realization of classically inconceivable Otto machines with an incompressible sample can be realized as well. The energy-level spacing of the system is the quantity that is being either compressed or stretched. These features are due to the existence of an effective geometry-induced quantum potential which is of pure quantum-mechanical origin.",
