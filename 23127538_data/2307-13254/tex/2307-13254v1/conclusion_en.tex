\section{Conclusion}
This study investigates forming embeddings for an object with multiple attributes using a single network, which is generally difficult in practice. However, the proposed method can extract various specific attribute features using a single backbone network. The proposed network enables multi-space embedding for multiple attributes. Finally, our proposed algorithm achieved SOTA performance in all evaluation metrics for the benchmark datasets.
