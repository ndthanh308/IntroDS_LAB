\subsection{Implementation Details}
\label{sec:impldetails}

The experimental environment was implemented using 8 RTX 3090 GPUs. We used Pytorch \cite{Paszke01} for all implementations. 
%We adapt ViT-B/16\cite{VIT} pre-trained on ImageNet-1k and ResNet50 as a backbone network. 
The backbone network was initialized with pre-trained R50+ViT-B/16 \cite{VIT}.
A batch size of 64 and learning rate of 0.0001 was applied for learning. We trained the models up to 200 epochs and selected the trained model that yielded the best results. Triplet loss, described in \autoref{sec:triplet}, was used with a margin of 0.2.
