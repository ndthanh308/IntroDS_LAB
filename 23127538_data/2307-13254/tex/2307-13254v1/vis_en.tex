\subsection{Visualization of Multi-Space Embedding and Ranking Results}
\label{sec:vis}


\paragraph{Entangled \vs Disentangled Multi-space Embedding} 
The proposed method enables multi-space embedding for various specific attributes with only one backbone network. When using the general learning method, entanglement in the embedding space inevitably occurs. To solve the entanglement problem and verify whether multi-space embeddings were formed, t-SNE \cite{Laurens01} was used to examine the results. The t-SNE visualization results in \autoref{fig:fig4} show whether each attribute class of the FashionAI dataset is properly embedded. The t-SNE visualization results at the center are for the FashionAI dataset with 8 fashion attributes. For the proposed method, excellent embedding results are found for all 8 attributes in the center, and each attribute on the edges. However, training a single model for multiple attributes with the non-conditional method, which is the triplet network in \autoref{tab:fashionAI}, \autoref{tab:DARN}, and \autoref{tab:DeepFashion}, do not solve the entanglement problem. These findings offer strong evidence that the proposed method achieved multi-space embedding with only one backbone network.

\paragraph{Ours \vs Previous Works' Multi-space Embedding} 

\autoref{fig:fig7} compares the embedding results between the proposed and previous (ASEN~\cite{ma2020fine}, CAMNet~\cite{song2022}) methods for the FashionAI dataset. The comparison results for 3 of the 8 detailed categories (Neck Design, Sleeve Length, and Coat Length) in FashionAI are shown. Our method yielded better embedding results than ASEN and CAMNet. For example, in the ASEN and CAMNet results, entanglement occurred in the embedding space for the Wrist Length, Long Sleeves, and Extra-long Sleeves classes of Sleeve Length, whereas entanglement is resolved with our proposed method. \autoref{fig:app4} presents the embedding results for the 8 attributes in the FashionAI dataset.

\paragraph{Ranking Results} 
\autoref{fig:app3} in \autoref{sec:more_vis} presents the Top 3 ranking results for the 8 attributes in the FashionAI dataset. The order in the figure is lapel design (notched), neckline design (round), skirt length (floor), pant length (midi), sleeve length (short), neck design (low turtle), coat length (midi), and collar design (peter pan). The features of each attribute are reflected accurately in the ranking. This is also demonstrated in the attention heat map.
