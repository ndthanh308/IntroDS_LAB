\subsection{Benchmarking}
\label{sec:eval}

\autoref{tab:fashionAI}, \autoref{tab:DARN}, and \autoref{tab:DeepFashion} present the evaluations for mAP using the metrics in \autoref{sec:Metrics}. \autoref{tab:zappos50k} shows the triplet prediction metric results. In all tables, our method outperforms the SOTA models CSN \cite{veit2017} and ASEN \cite{ma2020fine}.

\paragraph{FashionAI} 
In \autoref{tab:fashionAI}, our method achieves SOTA performance for all categories except neck design. Overall, we achieve a +4.72\% performance improvement.
% In \autoref{tab:fashionAI}, our method achieves SOTA performance for all categories except neck design. For each evaluation item, our method yields the following performance improvements: +3.21\% for skirt length, +8.39\% for sleeve length, +8.92\% for coat length, +3.97\% for pant length, +2.45\% for collar design, +4.15\% for lapel design, and +3.61\% for neckline design. Overall, this corresponds to a performance improvement of +4.72\%.

\paragraph{DARN} 
In \autoref{tab:DARN}, the proposed model yields SOTA performance for all items. Averaged across the board, it shows a significant performance improvement of +12.15\%.
% In \autoref{tab:DARN}, the proposed model yields SOTA performance for all items. For each evaluation item, our method yields the following performance improvements: +12.89\% for the clothes category, +17.79\% for clothes button, +2.87\% for clothes color, +14.33\% for clothes length, +12.73\% for clothes pattern, +16.26\% for clothes shape, +14.86\% for collar shape, +6.32\% for sleeve length, and +10.29\% for sleeve shape. Overall, this corresponds to a performance improvement of +12.15\%.

\paragraph{DeepFashion}
% In \autoref{tab:DeepFashion}, the proposed model yields SOTA performance for all items with the following performance improvements: +1.16\% for texture-related, +0.75\% for fabric-related, +2.52\% for shape-related, +1.87\% for part-related, and +0.85\% for style-related. Overall, this corresponds to a performance improvement of +1.4\%. As shown in \autoref{tab:datasets}, although it consists of only five attributes, these contain many more classes than FashionAI and DARN at 1000, resulting in a relatively low mAP value.

\paragraph{Zappos50K} 
\autoref{tab:zappos50k} presents the triplet prediction metric results. Our method achieved SOTA performance, with a +3.61\% improvement compared to the previous method. Unlike the aforementioned datasets, the Zappos50K dataset is relatively simple, as indicated by the category composition in \autoref{tab:datasets} and the example in \autoref{fig:app2}.
