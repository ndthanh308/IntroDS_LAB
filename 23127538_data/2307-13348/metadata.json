  "abstract": "Gaussian Boson Sampling (GBS) is a recently developed paradigm of quantum computing consisting of sending a Gaussian state through a linear interferometer and then counting the number of photons in each output mode. When the system encodes a symmetric matrix, GBS can be viewed as a tool to sample subgraphs: the most sampled are those with a large number of perfect matchings, and thus are the densest ones. This property has been the foundation of the novel clustering approach we propose in this work, called GBS-based clustering, which relies solely on GBS, without the need of classical algorithms. The GBS-based clustering has been tested on several datasets and benchmarked with two well-known classical clustering algorithms. Results obtained by using a GBS simulator show that on average our approach outperforms the two classical algorithms in two out of the three chosen metrics, proposing itself as a viable full-quantum clustering option.",
