  "abstract": "Given Krein and Hilbert spaces $\\left( \\mathcal{K},[.,.] \\right)$ and $\\left( \\mathcal{H}, \\left( .,. \\right) \\right)$, respectively, the concept of the boundary triple $Π=(\\mathcal{H}, Γ_{0}, Γ_{1})$ is generalized through the abstract Green's identity for the isometric relation $Γ$ between Krein spaces $\\left( \\mathcal{K}^{2}, \\left[ .,.\\right]_{\\mathcal{K}^{2}} \\right) $ and $\\left(\\mathcal{H}^{2}, \\left[ .,.\\right]_{\\mathcal{H}^{2}} \\right) $ without any conditions on $\\dom\\, Γ$ and $\\ran\\, Γ$. This also means that we do not assume the existence of a closed symmetric linear relation $S$ such that $\\dom\\, Γ=S^{+}$, which is a standard assumptions in all previous research of boundary triples. The main properties of such a general Green's boundary model are proven. In the process, some useful properties of the isometric relation $V$ between two Krein spaces $X$ and $Y$ are proven. Additionally, surprising properties of the unitary relation $Γ: \\mathcal{K}^{2} \\rightarrow\\mathcal{H}^{2}$ and the self-adjoint main transformation $\\tilde{A}$ of $Γ$ are discovered. Then, two statements about generalized Nevanlinna families are generalized using this Green's boundary model. Furthermore, several previously known boundary triples involving a Hilbert space $\\mathcal{K}$ and reduction operator $Γ: \\mathcal{K}^{2} \\rightarrow\\mathcal{H}^{2}$, such as AB-generalized, B-generalized, ordinary, isometric, unitary, quasi-boundary, and S-generalized boundary triples, have been extended to a Krein space $\\mathcal{K}$ and linear relation $Γ$ using the Green's boundary model approach.",
