  "abstract": "The spin polarization of heavy quarks in heavy-ion collisions at the LHC is estimated from effective field theories (EFTs). One EFT is similar to the HQET used at zero temperature. This gives a coupling of the heavy quark spin to colour and electromagnetic fields in heavy-ion collisions. The second EFT describes the interaction of heavy quarks and hydrodynamic modes, and gives the coupling between the heavy quark spin and the local vorticity of the fireball. Using these, we find that the measurement of polarization of the heavy quark from small to moderate p_T at the LHC is predicted with a single free parameter proportional to the vorticity. As a result, the heavy quark polarization is the same whether it is derived from the spin alignment of heavy vector mesons or the polarization of heavy baryons. We also predict that the parameter does not differ much between charm and bottom quarks.",
