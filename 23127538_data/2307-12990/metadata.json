  "abstract": "This study focuses on attitude and control motion of two bodies (a base-satellite and a sub-satellite) connected by an inextensible and massless tether in a circular orbit under the influence of the Earths gravitational force. The base-satellite is assumed to be far more heavier than the sub-satellite. In such cases, the base-satellite is regarded as the reference spacecraft. Because of the complexity of the problem, no thrusters on the sub-satellite are considered, and the effect of atmospheric drag, Earths oblateness, and electrodynamic force on the spacecraft are neglected.",
