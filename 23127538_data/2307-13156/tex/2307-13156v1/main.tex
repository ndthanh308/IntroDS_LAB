This volume exhibits the revised lecture notes of the second teacher training organized
as part of the project \emph{Promoting Sustainability as a Fundamental Driver in Software Development Training and Education},
and held at the Juraj Dobrila University of Pula, Croatia, in the week January 23--27, 2023.
The project is the Erasmus+ project \emph{No. 2020{-}1{-}PT01{-}KA203{-}078646 --- Sustrainable}.
More details can be found at the official project web site

\end{center}

\noindent but for convenience of the reader, the brief description of the project is quoted as follows.

``Sustainability as a key driver for the development of modern society and the future of the planet has never achieved as much consensus worldwide as today.

Ultimately, it is the hardware of ICT systems that consumes energy, but it is software that controls this hardware. Thus, controlling the software is crucial to reduce the ever-growing energy footprint of ICT systems. The Sustrainable project advocates the introduction of all facets of sustainability as a primary concern into software engineering practice.

This project aims to actively promote educating the next generation of software engineers to consider sustainability in all aspects of the software engineering process: SusTrainable means Training for Sustainability. We aim to provide future software engineers with essential skills to develop software that is not only functionally correct, but also easy to maintain and evolve, that is durable, has a low impact and uses the hardware it is running on in the most energy-efficient way.

Our objective is to train the future avant-garde software engineers for the sustainable software and ICT that the knowledge-based, environmentally concerned societies of the 21st century demand. The majority of summer school participants are close to their transition from learning to doing and will soon join the European software engineering workforce. They will carry the ideas, concepts and methods they learned at the summer schools into industrial software engineering practice across Europe and worldwide. Furthermore, they will act as facilitators and multipliers alike for a sustainable future software-driven Europe. Conversely, we provide the ubiquitous enthusiasm of the younger generation for sustainable development a constructive, meaningful and high-impact route forward.

For this purpose we assemble a broad and diverse consortium of researchers and educators from 10 selected universities and 7 countries from across Europe.''

\bigskip

One of the most important contributions of the project are two summer schools. The 2nd SusTrainable Summer School (SusTrainable -- 23) will be organized
at the University of Coimbra, Portugal, in the week July 10--14, 2023. The summer school
will consist of lectures and practical work for master and PhD students in the area of computing science and closely related fields.
There will be contributions from
Babe\textcommabelow{s}-Bolyai University,
E\"{o}tv\"{o}s Lor\'{a}nd University,
Juraj Dobrila University of Pula,
Radboud University Nijmegen,
Roskilde University,
Technical University of Ko\v{s}ice,
University of Amsterdam,
University of Coimbra,
University of Minho,
University of Plovdiv,
University of Porto,
University of Rijeka.

To prepare and streamline the summer school, the consortium organized a teacher training in Pula, Croatia.
This was an event of five full days in the week January 23--27, 2023, organized by Tihana Galinac Grbac and Neven Grbac at the Juraj Dobrila University of Pula, Croatia.
The Juraj Dobrila University of Pula is very concerned with the sustainability issues. The education, research and management is conducted with sustainability goals in mind. The university
participates in the UI GreenMetric World University Rankings.

The goal of this teacher training is to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of all the educational activities at the forthcoming
2nd SusTrainable Summer School at the University of Coimbra.

An effective and efficient summer school consists of a series of educational and teaching activities by a number of invited researchers and/or educators. It is important that these
activities are of high quality, but also that they are not totally unrelated and independent. The thing is that a summer school is usually very demanding for students, thus, a well
balanced combination of forms of activities and teaching methodologies would improve students' satisfaction with the knowledge and techniques acquired at the school. Besides that, it
is very convenient that different activities explain their part at the same or similar examples, the tasks are related and different aspects well explained.

At the teacher training, all the proposed summer school teachers are asked to present their plan for the activities at the summer school. This includes an outline and content for their series of
activities (course), the teaching methodology and the form of activities, prerequisites assumed the students will be familiar with (including their expected previous knowledge, practical
skills, programming tools).
The final outcome of the training should be a detailed plan for each teacher's series of activities at the summer school, orchestrated with all other teachers in the sense explained
above. The plans should include the list of prerequisites required by the students (with references and possibly some pre-school reading assignments), the required hardware and
software for the summer school (for the organizers), and an overview of the lecture material, examples and student assignments.


As in the first teacher training, the contents of the planned summer school lectures were discussed and fine-tuned.
The topics discussed in regard of each contribution are the following:
\begin{itemize}
\item
    the contents of the intended lecture, but not the entire lecture itself;
\item
    what is the intended audience;
\item
    what is the required knowledge and skills of the audience;
\item
    what are required materials (hardware and software) for the exercises;
\item
    what will students know after this lecture and can this be used in subsequent lectures;
\item
    what is the relation with other contributions, other dependencies and what are the lessons learned during the teacher training.
\end{itemize}


Apart from the discussion regarding the contributions of the summer school and other outcomes of the teacher training mentioned above and listed in the proceedings,
there were invited lectures focused on best practices in teaching IT-related topics in view of sustainability goals of the summer school:
\begin{itemize}
\item
    Dr.\ Patricia Lago from the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam: \emph{VU Master-level education in software engineering, green IT, and digital sustainability}.
\item
    Dr.\ Darko Etinger and Dr.\ Sini\v{s}a Mili\v{c}i\'{c} from the Juraj Dobrila University of Pula: \emph{Virtual study of informatics: experiences and best practices}.
\end{itemize}
Those presentations provided useful background knowledge for the teaching team.

\end{center}

\noindent
for the complete schedule of the teacher training.

The contributions in the proceedings were reviewed and provide a good overview of the range of topics that will be covered at the summer school.
The papers in the proceedings, as well as the very constructive and cooperative teacher training, guarantee the highest quality and
beneficial summer school for all participants. We are looking forward to contributing to a sustainable future.
