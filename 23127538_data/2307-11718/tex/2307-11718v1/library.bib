abstract = {In the four regions (North America, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific) we examine, there are value premiums in average stock returns that, except for Japan, decrease with size. Except for Japan, there is return momentum everywhere, and spreads in average momentum returns also decrease from smaller to bigger stocks. We test whether empirical asset pricing models capture the value and momentum patterns in international average returns and whether asset pricing seems to be integrated across the four regions. Integrated pricing across regions does not get strong support in our tests. For three regions (North America, Europe, and Japan), local models that use local explanatory returns provide passable descriptions of local average returns for portfolios formed on size and value versus growth. Even local models are less successful in tests on portfolios formed on size and momentum. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Importantly, none has been documented as to whether explosivity periods in cryptocurrencies are contemporaneously related. Accordingly, we date-stamp price explosivity in leading cryptocurrencies and reveal that all cryptocurrencies investigated herein were characterised by multiple explosivity. Then, we determine whether explosivity in one cryptocurrency can lead to explosivity in other cryptocurrencies. Results show evidence of a multidirectional co-explosivity behaviour that is not necessarily from bigger to smaller and younger markets.},

abstract = {[Figure presented] The electricity that is expended in the process of mining Bitcoin has become a topic of heavy debate over the past few years. It is a process that makes Bitcoin extremely energy-hungry by design, as the currency requires a huge amount of hash calculations for its ultimate goal of processing financial transactions without intermediaries (peer-to-peer). The primary fuel for each of these calculations is electricity. The Bitcoin network can be estimated to consume at least 2.55 gigawatts of electricity currently, and potentially 7.67 gigawatts in the future, making it comparable with countries such as Ireland (3.1 gigawatts) and Austria (8.2 gigawatts). Economic models tell us that Bitcoin's electricity consumption will gravitate toward the latter number. A look at Bitcoin miner production estimates suggests that this number could already be reached in 2018.},

The aim is to investigate the current state of blockchain technology and its applications in several specific characteristics of this disruptive technology can revolutionise “business-as-usual” practices. To this end, the theoretical underpinnings of numerous research papers published in high ranked scientific journals during the last decade, along with several reports from grey literature as a means of streamlining our assessment and capturing the continuously expanding blockchain domain, are included in this review. Based on a structured, systematic review and thematic content analysis of the discovered literature, we present a comprehensive classification of blockchain-enabled applications across diverse sectors such as supply chain, business, healthcare, IoT, privacy, and data management, and we establish key themes, trends and emerging areas for research. We also point to the shortcomings identified in the relevant literature, particularly limitations the blockchain technology presents and how these limitations spawn across different sectors and industries. Building on these findings, we identify various research gaps and future exploratory directions that are anticipated to be of significant value both for academics and practitioners.},

abstract = {Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are operated by a handful of mining pools. Nearly 95{\%} of Bit coin's and 80{\%} of Ethereum's mining power resides with less than ten and six mining pools respectively. Although miners benefit from low payout variance in pooled mining, centralized mining pools require members to trust that pool operators will remunerate them fairly. Furthermore, centralized pools pose the risk of transaction censorship from pool operators, and open up possibilities for collusion between pools for perpetrating severe attacks. In this work, we propose SMARTPOOL, a novel protocol design for a decentralized mining pool. Our protocol shows how one can leverage smart contracts, autonomous blockchain programs, to decentralize cryptocurrency mining SMARTPOOL gives transaction selection control back to miners while yielding low variance payouts. SMARTPOOL incurs mining fees lower than centralized mining pools and is designed to scale to a large number of miners. We implemented and deployed a robust SMARTPOOL implementation on the Ethereum and Ethereum Classic networks. To date, our deployed pools have handled a peak hashrate of 30 GHs from Ethereum miners, resulting in 105 blocks, costing miners a mere 0.6{\%} of block rewards in transaction fees.},

We employ a ADCC model and find that Bitcoin can be an intraday hedge for the CHF, EUR and GBP, but acts as a diversifier for the AUD, CAD and JPY. We also implement the non-temporal Hansen (2000) test to examine the safe haven properties of Bitcoin and find that Bitcoin is a safe haven during periods of extreme market turmoil for the CAD, CHF and GBP. Therefore our results indicate that Bitcoin does act as an intraday hedge, diversifier and safe haven for certain currencies, which will be of great interest to currency, cryptocurrency and high frequency investors alike.},

A branch of literature links the existence of a bubble in some financial asset's price to strict local martingales — a finitely lived asset has a bubble if, and only if, it is a strict local martingale under the equivalent risk-neutral measure. A diffusion process is a strict local martingale if its volatility increases faster than linearly as its level grows. We apply a nonparametric method to estimate the volatility function of Bitcoin daily and high frequency prices, as well as of more traditional financial assets. We then estimate the stochastic volatility model of Andersen and Piterbarg (2007), whose parameter space has a specific subset under which the asset's price is a strict local martingale. Results suggest the existence of a bubble in Bitcoin prices from early 2013 to mid 2014, but, interestingly, not in late 2017.},

abstract = {This paper provides the first empirical evidence of how the unique properties of crypto-asset returns impact event-study test performance. Employing a simulation approach with actual price data from 1877 unique crypto-assets over the period of January 1st, 2015 to June 30th, 2018 reveals that both parametric procedures and non-parametric procedures often result in significant statistical errors. In the presence of event-day clustering, only the Generalized Rank T-Test is both powerful and well specified. To estimate abnormal returns, the market-model with a value-weighted index produces test statistics with distributions closest to expectation. The empirical evidence provided by the simulation then used in the first ever crypto-asset based event-study. Specifically, the event study investigated allegations of insider trading by the worlds largest crypto-asset exchange Binance.com. A total of 44 unique listing announcements during the period of September 2017 to June 2018. produce a statistically significant two day return of 13.6{\%} (CAR(0,1)). However, the GRANK-T test fails to reject the null hypothesis of no insider trading during the three days preceding the announcements. Guidance and future applications of event-studies with crypto-asset returns are discussed.},

abstract = {Using the spillover index approach and its variants, we examine both static and dynamic volatility connectedness among eight typical cryptocurrencies. The results reveal that their connectedness fluctuates cyclically and has shown an obvious rise trend since the end of 2016. In the variance decomposition framework, we further construct a volatility connectedness network linking 52 cryptocurrencies using the LASSO-VAR for estimating high-dimensional VARs. We find that these 52 cryptocurrencies are tightly interconnected and “mega-cap” cryptocurrencies are more likely to propagate volatility shocks to others. However, some unnoticeable cryptocurrencies (e.g., Maidsafe Coin) are also significant net-transmitters of volatility connectedness and even have larger contribution of volatility spillovers to others.},

The TVM-aGAS model is particularly suitable for processing the fat-tailed and extreme volatility characteristics of cryptocurrency returns. We then apply it to Value-at-Risk (VaR) forecasting of three cryptocurrencies, obtaining testing results that show our model possesses advantages in forecasting the density of daily cryptocurrency returns. Compared to other benchmarked models, the proposed model performs well in forecasting out-of-sample VaR. The findings underscore that our method is a useful and reliable alternative for forecasting VaR in cryptocurrencies.},

Recently, a novel approach termed velvet fork, which expands upon the concept of a soft fork, was outlined in [22]. Specifically, velvet forks intend to avoid the possibility of disagreement by a change of rules through rendering modifications to the protocol backward compatible and inclusive to legacy blocks. We present an overview and definitions of these different upgrade mechanisms and outline their relationships. Hereby, we expose examples where velvet forks or similar constructions are already actively employed in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

The objective of this paper is to provide a comprehensive review of the literature and propose a conceptual framework for accounts manipulation. This framework is based on the possibility of wealth transfer between the different stake-holders, and in practice, the target of the manipulation appears generally to be the earnings per share and the debt/equity ratio. The paper also describes the different actors involved and their potential gains and losses. We review the literature on the various techniques of accounts manipulation: earnings management, income smoothing, big bath accounting, creative accounting, and window-dressing. The various definitions of all these, the main motivations behind their application and the research methodologies used are all examined. This study reveals that all the above techniques have common elements, but there are also important differences between them. {\textcopyright} 2004, Emerald Group Publishing Limited},

@techreport{Zumwalde2021,
abstract = {Introduction The field of decentralized finance has been growing at a rapid pace. This growth has been driven by the institutional privileges that these platforms provide individual users. Many protocols for lending (Compound(1), Aave(2)), yield farming (Curve(3), Yearn(4) and exchanges (Uniswap(5), Sushiswap(6)) have seen unprecedented growth. Consequently, new protocols are continually being developed. The constant stream of protocol deployment is compounding data problems. To keep pace with DeFi data's exponential growth, there is a clear need to assure data integrity and preserve decentralization via user-based governance. While blockchain data is natively provable, normalization and backward compatibility is virtually nonexistent. Credmark employs game theory, data pipelines, machine learning, and governance defined data structures to allow data scientists and developers to easily create models. Once the data is structured, statistical and predictive models can be used for deeper insights and the results can be deployed into production environments. This allows users to make more actionable, informed, and risk-adjusted decisions on their DeFi positions. Users in DeFi are faced with a variety of complex financial tools normally reserved for institutional investors and professional traders. The access to these tools democratizes finance, but retail users lack the ability to compete due to the absence of in-house back-office services. Credmark provides these services on the retail users' behalf by bootstrapping the platform with risk management tools and analysis. These risk models address protocol, pool, asset, and counterparty risk scenarios using a variety of agents, validated periodically using backtesting and outlier detection. By incentivizing developers to contribute strategic models and to participate in community governance, we quickly incentivize model accuracy, usefulness, accountability, ownership, and completeness.},

abstract = {While corporate social responsibility (CSR) reports are intended to faithfully represent CSR performance, voluntarily disclosed CSR information tends to be positive, and demand is rising for both independent assurance and integrated reporting of CSR. However, the supply of CSR assurance is not widespread in the United States, and CSR performance information remains largely separated from supporting and governance information. We thus examine the role of CSR assurance when information on CSR investment level is integrated with information on whether managerial pay is explicitly tied to sustainability. While a firm may report a high level of CSR investment to indicate an authentic commitment to CSR, investors may become skeptical of reported information if managerial pay is explicitly tied to CSR performance. Such pay-for-CSRperformance provides managers with greater incentives to overinvest in CSR and thereby report strong CSR performance. In turn, investors will seek CSR assurance as a disclosure credibility signal. Accordingly, we find that, in the presence of pay-for-CSRperformance and high CSR investment level, investors' stock price assessments are greater only when CSR assurance is also present. Our findings highlight the importance of examining CSR disclosure factor interaction effects, and provide support for the expansion of CSR assurance and integrated reporting.},

The emerging discipline of behavioral economics and finance has challenged the EMH, arguing that markets are not rational, but rather driven by fear and greed. Research in the cognitive neurosciences suggests these two perspectives are opposite sides of the same coin. An adaptive markets hypothesis that reconciles market efficiency with behavioral alternatives applies the principles of evolution?competition, adaptation, and natural selection?to financial interactions. Extending Simon's notion of ?satisficing? with evolutionary dynamics, the author argues that much of what behaviorists cite as counter-examples to economic rationality?loss aversion, overconfidence, overreaction, mental accounting, and other behavioral biases?is in fact consistent with an evolutionary model of individual adaptation to a changing environment via simple heuristics. The adaptive markets hypothesis offers a number of surprisingly concrete implications for portfolio management.},

Consequently, we compare BTC with major currencies and stock exchanges of the U.S., the EU, the U.K. and Japan (USD-SPX, EUR-DAX, GBP-FTSE and JPY-NIK), with currencies and stock exchanges of the U.S., the U.K., Russia, Venezuela and China where BTC is actively traded (USD-SPX, GBP-FTSE, RUB-MOEX, VEF-IBVC and YUAN- SSCE), with major commodities (GOLD and OIL) and with major altcoins (ETH, XRP and LTC) on a daily basis for the period spanning from 2010.07 to 2018.12. We employ Johansen co-integration, Granger causality, impulse response functions and forecast error variance decom- position analyses in our study. Our results show that BTC does not have a long-run relationship with any asset type, but that it has a short-run relationship with gold and especially altcoins, which are both significant and bidirectional. While BTC and altcoins are closely interrelated with each other, BTC price variation is mostly borne by its own prices in all cases.},

However decentralization cannot be taken for granted, as many presumably distributed cryptocurrency-mining activities have witnessed the rise of mining pools over time. We study the centralization and decentralization forces in the creation and competition of mining pools: risk-sharing benefits attract independent miners to pools, leading to centralization; however, pool concentration can be moderated through cross-pool diversification and endogenous pool fees. In particular, we show that larger pools charge higher fees, leading to disproportionally less miners to join and thus a slower pool size growth. Empirical evidence from Bitcoin mining supports our model predictions. },

Towards this goal, we attribute attack viability in the attack surface to 1) the Blockchain cryptographic constructs, 2) the distributed architecture of the systems using Blockchain, and 3) the Blockchain application context. To each of those contributing factors, we outline several attacks, including selfish mining, the 51{\%} attack, Domain Name System (DNS) attacks, distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks, consensus delay (due to selfish behavior or distributed denial-of-service attacks), Blockchain forks, orphaned and stale blocks, block ingestion, wallet thefts, smart contract attacks, and privacy attacks. We also explore the causal relationships between these attacks to demonstrate how various attack vectors are connected to one another. A secondary contribution of this work is outlining effective defense measures taken by the Blockchain technology or proposed by researchers to mitigate the effects of these attacks and patch associated vulnerabilities.},

Alternative statistical specifications and various estimation methods are applied to a comprehensive, high-quality data set that extends from 1971 to 1988. The sample includes both manufacturing and nonmanufacturing firms, companies from both sections of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, and also delisted securities. Our findings reveal a significant relationship between these variables and expected returns in the Japanese market. Of the four variables considered, the book to market ratio and cash flow yield have the most significant positive impact on expected returns. THE JAPANESE AND THE U.S. equity markets are, by far, the two largest in the world. As of March 1990, the two markets together accounted for 67{\%} of the world's stock market capitalization. In recent years, money managers in the U.S., as well as in other countries, have substantially increased their exposure to the Japanese market. However, in spite of the Japanese market's rapid growth and its increasing significance in the international financial arena, only recently have researchers turned their attention to the Tokyo market. In contrast to the voluminous research in the U.S. relating the cross-sectional behavior of stock returns to such variables as firm size, earnings yield, the editor Rene Stulz, and an anonymous referee.

abstract = {Initial coin offerings typically use blockchain technology to offer tokens that confer various rights in return, most often, for cryptocurrency. They can be seen as a conjunction of crowdfunding and blockchain. Based on a database of over 1000 ICO white papers, we provide a taxonomy of ICOs to increase understanding of their many forms, analyze the various regulatory challenges they pose, and suggest the first steps regulators should consider in response. As our database shows, ICOs are a global phenomenon and the global ICO market is much larger than generally thought, with overall ICO subscriptions estimated to exceed 75 billion USD as at the end of June 2018. The US ICO market is significant, but the US doesn't dominate this market, by any means. Furthermore, many ICOs are offered on the basis of utterly inadequate disclosure of information; more than half the ICO white papers are either silent on the initiators or backers or do not provide contact details, and an even greater share do not elaborate on the applicable law, segregation or pooling of client funds, and the existence of an external auditor. Accordingly, the decision to invest in them often cannot be the outcome of a rational calculus. Hallmarks of a classic speculative bubble are present. At the same time, ICOs provide a new, innovative and potentially important vehicle for raising funds to support innovative ideas and ventures, with the potential for aspects of their underlying structure to have an important impact on fundraising systems and structures in future.},

abstract = {Blockchain aims to transform businesses and other forms of transactions from a centralized, human-based to a shared, algorithm-based trust model, which enables a new risk management paradigm. Misaligned incentives in different principal – agent scenarios are important risk factors from governance point of view. With blockchain, these misalignments are accounted for algorithmically, therefore novel governance models are possible. What role do risks play in terms of deciding for, or against the adoption of blockchain? How to best define requirements to achieve it? This paper explores standards and risk as factors, which can support or hinder the sustained application of blockchain in a broad scope of environments. We conducted a systematic literature review that outlines a current understanding of perceived risk surrounding the adoption and use of blockchain technology in the context of requirements engineering. Furthermore, selected models for managing risks are presented. Finally, areas where deeper research is required are identified. We conclude that a gap exists in normative frameworks that affect the adoption and sustainable use of blockchain technology. Closing this gap can support the sustainable use of blockchain technology.},

Results show that Bitcoin behaves differently to traditional currencies. Traditional currencies typically experience a decrease in returns after negative news arrivals and an increase in returns following positive news whereas Bitcoin reacts positively to both positive and negative news. This suggests investor enthusiasm for Bitcoin irrespective of the sentiment of the news. This phenomenon is exacerbated during bubble periods. Conversely, cryptocurrency cyber-attack news and fraud news dampen this effect, decreasing Bitcoin returns and volatility. Our results contribute to the discussion on the nature of Bitcoin as a currency or an asset. They further inform practitioners about the characteristics of cryptocurrencies as a financial asset and inform regulators about the influence of news on Bitcoin volatility, particularly during bubble periods.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a new method to measure and monitor the risk in a banking system. Standard tools that regulators require banks to use for their internal risk management are applied at the level of the banking system to measure the risk of a regulator's portfolio. Using a sample of international banks from 1988 until 2002, I estimate the dynamics and correlations between bank asset portfolios. To obtain measures for the risk of a regulator's portfolio, I model the individual liabilities that the regulator has to each bank as contingent claims on the bank's assets. The portfolio aspect of the regulator's liability is explicitly considered and the methodology allows a comparison of sub-samples from different countries. Correlations, bank asset volatility, and bank capitalization increase for North American and somewhat for European banks, while Japanese banks face deteriorating capital levels. In the sample period, the North American banking system gains stability while the Japanese banking sector becomes more fragile. The expected future liability of the regulator varies substantially over time and is especially high during the Asian crisis starting in 1997. Further analysis shows that the Japanese banks contribute most to the volatility of the regulator's liability at that time. Larger and more profitable banks have lower systemic risk and additional equity capital reduces systemic risk only for banks that are constrained by regulatory capital requirements. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In enhancing the role of innovative techniques which involve the use of distributed ledger technology platforms, consequences or implications of such techniques could initially focus on more obvious risks – such as those risks associated with financial stability, inadequate governance and control mechanisms in place, or cybercrime. However, consideration of climate risk related factors have increasingly made the aim of focus towards a sustainable future, a more popular and increasingly justified topic. In a recent report by the European Environmental Agency, it was highlighted that “ in comparison with alternative payment methods, Bitcoin was claimed to be 20,000 times more energy intensive than Visa – with an energy consumption for each Bitcoin transaction increasing to 635 kWh – an equivalent of electricity that could power approximately 21 US households for 1 day, based on 2019 estimates according to some analysts.” However there are also potential benefits to be derived from blockchain technology - one of which includes environmental protection, as further highlighted in the report. Notwithstanding, efforts and endeavors will still be required to address climate related impacts of engaging the use of such technologies. This paper will focus on other risks – as well as benefits to be derived through the use of innovative techniques such as smart contracts and decentralized finance in a rapidly evolving financial landscape. It will also highlight why central bankers and financial regulation have to adapt and evolve rapidly in engaging the use of supervisory techniques which will not only enhance the efficiency of the use of such innovative techniques but also facilitate an adequate and well balanced approached to regulation – one which whilst not overly regulating technology, seeks to ensure that the abuse or misuse of such technologies are appropriately regulated.},

Within two years of its quiet launch in 2009, Bit coin grew to comprise billions of dollars of economic value despite only cursory analysis of the system's design. Since then a growing literature has identified hidden-but-important properties of the system, discovered attacks, proposed promising alternatives, and singled out difficult future challenges. Meanwhile a large and vibrant open-source community has proposed and deployed numerous modifications and extensions. We provide the first systematic exposition Bit coin and the many related crypto currencies or 'altcoins.' Drawing from a scattered body of knowledge, we identify three key components of Bit coin's design that can be decoupled. This enables a more insightful analysis of Bit coin's properties and future stability. We map the design space for numerous proposed modifications, providing comparative analyses for alternative consensus mechanisms, currency allocation mechanisms, computational puzzles, and key management tools. We survey anonymity issues in Bit coin and provide an evaluation framework for analyzing a variety of privacy-enhancing proposals. Finally we provide new insights on what we term disinter mediation protocols, which absolve the need for trusted intermediaries in an interesting set of applications. We identify three general disinter mediation strategies and provide a detailed comparison.},

The most representative features of this new phenomenon are strong price increases and high volatility. The investigations developed in this field are not excessively numerous nor unanimous. Some researches consider this phenomenon to be a bubble, since they don't agree that the price pattern of the cryptocurrencies is justified or explained by their intrinsic value. The present article aims to provide a theoretical framework for the assessment of these new realities embodied by cryptocurrencies. We have created a model which differentiates two types of cryptocurrencies: the cryptocurrencies meant to fund a specific project, and the cryptocurrencies designed for general or non-specific uses. We will also make a distinction between block chain networks designed to work only with cryptocurrencies from those which admit other tasks. Our model establishes the difference between the value of the currency and that of the network. The result of this research is a theoretical valuation model based on three fundamental categories of cryptocurrencies by purpose or finality.},

Behavioral changes on the part of individuals are required for organizational change, and compensation systems affect behavior. Thus, it is critical to consider the role that compensation systems play in the process of organizational change.     The paper explains why establishing a strong, positive relation between rewards and performance is critical to bringing about value-creating organizational change. Throughout it draws on ideas and evidence, both old and new, from theory and practice. The ways in which well-designed compensation systems create value in organizations are grouped into four broad categories.    Specifically, compensation systems:  1. Improve the motivation and productivity of employees,  2. Promote productive turnover in personnel,  3. Mobilize valuable specific knowledge by allowing effective decentralization, and  4. Help overcome organizational inertia and opposition to change.    The paper also analyzes the issue of timing in the implementation of a new compensation system. Conventional wisdom in the field of organizational behavior advocates changing compensation systems only after new "strategy and structure" are designed and implemented. In contrast, I provide arguments and evidence in support of changing compensation systems "early." By early, I mean that compensation systems should be redesigned after managers identify and adopt an over-arching objective for the firm, but before they have completely specified how that objective  translates into a new strategy and/or structure.},

abstract = {Novel technologies are continually being developed every day. Lessons from the past show that some resulted in unintended harm to the Earth's system. The challenge for organizations working at the interface of the environment, technology, and society is, therefore, how to best harness the environmental benefits from new technologies while minimizing their potential adverse effects. Here, we identify some of the emerging technologies that the international development community needs to consider as it seeks to take advantage of new technologies to promote sustainable development. There are several innovations – such as blockchain, nanotechnology, synthetic biology, cellular agriculture, and gene editing techniques that could either positively or negatively affect the environment, food security, human health, and the transition to clean energy. Some of their benefits and potential environmental and socio-economic concerns are discussed. We further suggest actions that can be taken by organizations involved in sustainable development, such as the United Nations and other global and regional bodies, to exploit the benefits from novel technologies and mitigate their risks.},

abstract = {The cryptocurrency market has witnessed significant growth in the past few months. The emergence of hundreds of new digital currencies and the huge increase in the prices of their leading representatives have attracted a lot of attention from investors. However, the financial characteristics of the cryptocurrency markets have not been systematically evaluated yet. As a consequence, there is currently no consensus on whether cryptocurrencies constitute an individual asset class or if they share substantial similarities to stocks, bonds, commodities or foreign exchange. Based on Markowitz et al. (2017), this paper aims to fill this lack of research by evaluating the cryptocurrency market based on seven requirements of an individual asset class. The authors find that the cryptocurrency market distinguishes itself remarkably from established asset classes in terms of risk and return. Additionally, the low correlation between the cryptocurrency markets and these established asset classes induces a diversification potential for investors, leading to more favorable risk/return profiles of their portfolios. But also the emergence of investment services and products provided by the financial industry and the increasingly cost-effective access to cryptocurrencies corroborate the conclusion that cryptocurrencies can be seen as an individual asset class},

It has wide spectrum of applications ranging from finance to social services and has greatly influenced the emerging business world. Since, blockchain technology is getting embedded in the e-commerce services, the cryptocurrencies are gaining huge prevalence. Bitcoin and ethereum are few such crypto currencies, which have utilized decentralized nature of blockchain. Blockchain can be considered as a distributed database system containing immutable ledgers, which are prone to attack by malicious users. Although, from the initial digital currency to the present smart contract, the utilities of blockchain have been harnessed, the innovative technology has to rely on cryptography for its security. There are several reports, which emphases on the vulnerabilities and security of blockchain, however, there is a lack of a comprehensive and methodical survey in both application and technical views. In this survey article, the authors cover various aspects related to blockchain including its taxonomies and the situations in which a particular category of blockchain should be applied. The authors also focusses on the structure of blockchain and the working of the ongoing transactions in the cryptocurrency network. In addition, the authors also specify various categories of consensus protocols, smart contracts, forks, techniques for generating the consensus. A detailed taxonomy of blockchain along with their features and related real-world applications is also discussed. In addition, existing key platforms of blockchain related to the cryptocurrencies, hyperledger and multichain are also discussed. Existing emerging vulnerabilities of blockchain related to the recent attacks on bitcoin and etherum is also presented along with the defensive methodologies and future trends in blockchain.},

abstract = {This study applies a set of measures developed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2012, 2016)to examine connectedness via return and volatility spillovers across six large cryptocurrencies from August 7, 2015 to February 22, 2018. Regardless of the sign of returns, the results show that Litecoin and Bitcoin are at the centre of the connected network of returns. This finding implies that return shocks arising from these two cryptocurrencies have the most effect on other cryptocurrencies. Further analysis shows that connectedness via negative returns is largely stronger than via positive ones. Ripple and Ethereum are the top recipients of negative-return shocks, whereas Ethereum and Dash exhibit very weak connectedness via positive returns. Regarding volatility spillovers, Bitcoin is the most influential, followed by Litecoin; Dash exhibits a very weak connectedness, suggesting its utility for hedging and diversification opportunities in the cryptocurrency market. Taken together, results imply that the importance of each cryptocurrency in return and volatility connectedness is not necessarily related to its market size. Further analyses reveal that trading volume and global financial and uncertainty effects as well as the investment-substitution effect are determinants of net directional spillovers. Interestingly, higher gold prices and US uncertainty increase the net directional negative-return spillovers, whereas they do the opposite for net directional positive-return spillovers. Furthermore, gold prices exhibit a negative sign for net directional-volatility spillovers, whereas US uncertainty shows a positive sign. Economic actors interested in the cryptocurrency market can build on our findings when weighing their decisions.},

Over the period under consideration, BTC investment had highly distinctive features, including exceptionally high average return and volatility. Its correlation with other assets was remarkably low. Spanning tests confirm that BTC investment offers significant diversification benefits. We show that the inclusion of even a small proportion of BTCs may dramatically improve the risk-return trade-off of well-diversified portfolios.

In this set of exploratory analyses we seek to classify Bitcoin. We utilize a variety of methods to compare aspects of its behavior to: currencies, asset classes such as derivatives, technology-based products and possible technology-based products such as Ether and the security SPY, and speculative financial bubbles. We find that Bitcoin's behavior more closely resembles a technology-based product, an emerging asset class, or a bubble event, rather than a currency or a security; such that it is correct that existing currency and security laws should not apply to cryptocurrencies.},

We also derive closed-form formula of the probability of temporary fork and the expected mining reward of a mining pool. To reveal the long-term trends on the computing power distributions over the competing mining pools, we then develop an evolutionary game framework based on the temporary fork modeling and accordingly characterize the set of stable evolution equilibrium.

The aim is to outline blockchain's benefits, opportunities, costs, risks as well as challenges of the technology in the context of banking and finance services. Design/methodology/approach: Careful examination of the extant literature, including utilising relevant academic-based research databases has been carried out. It covered reviewing various research contributions published in peer-reviewed journals, academic reports, as well as technical reports to help in identifying related benefits, opportunities, costs and risks. Findings: The findings reveal that there are limited contributions in utilising blockchain in the banking and finance sectors when compared with other sectors. As such, the study highlighted the relevant perspective of benefits, opportunities, costs and risks within such sectors. Practical implications: This study helps in offering a focal point to banking and financial sector managers and decision-makers for realising the value and offerings of blockchain technology as well as associated strategies and programmes. Originality/value: This study highlights the need for a holistic understanding of the various aspects of cost, benefits, risk and opportunities to create blockchain applications that work for banking and finance sectors},

abstract = {This paper examines the ability of beta and size to explain cross-sectional variation in average returns in 12 European countries. We find that average stock returns are positively related to beta and negatively related to firm size. The beta premium is in part due to the fact that high beta countries outperform low beta countries. Within countries high beta stocks outperform low beta stocks only in January, not in other months. We reject the hypothesis that differences in average returns on size- and beta-sorted portfolios can be explained by market risk and exposure to the excess return of small over large stocks (SMB). Consistent with recent US evidence, we find that after controlling for size, there is no association between average returns and exposure to SMB. {\textcopyright} 1999 Blackwell Publishers Ltd.},

What determines its valuation is an important open question with far-reaching business and policy implications. Building on information systems and finance literature, we examine the dynamic interactions between social media and the monetary value of bitcoin using textual analysis and vector error correction models. We show that more bullish forum posts are associated with higher future bitcoin values. Interestingly, social media's effects on bitcoin are driven primarily by the silent majority, the 95 percent of users who are less active and whose contributions amount to less than 40 percent of total messages. In addition, messages on an Internet forum, relative to tweets, have a stronger impact on future bitcoin value. Overall, our findings reveal that social media sentiment is an important predictor in determining bitcoin's valuation, but not all social media messages are of equal impact. This study offers new insights into the digital currency market and the economic impact of social media.},

The following conclusions are reached: (1) PECR is constructed to depict the deviation degree between the price and production cost, while BC is used to illustrate the bubble size in the price, and both are effective measures; (2) the number of unique addresses is a suitable measure of the use value of Bitcoin, and this result has passed the Granger causality test; (3) PECR and BC are verified via the LPPL model, and the next large bubble is expected in the second half of 2020.

We find that higher volatility, trading volume and transactions are positively associated with the presence of bubbles across cryptocurrencies. Regarding the uncertainty variables, the VIX-index consistently demonstrates negative relationships with bubble occurrence, while the EPU-index mostly exhibits positive associations with bubbles.

Instead, a market for transaction-processing determines the fees users pay to gain priority and avoid transaction-processing delays.

It is important to further develop our understanding of the inter-dynamics between this relatively youthful financial product and pricing sensitivities associated with corporate technological advancement. Several interesting results are presented. First, Bitcoin is identified as a volatility receiver instead of a transmitter across all of the time frequencies considered during periods of patent development. Secondly, Microsoft, Mastercard, Intel and Visa contribute the largest volatility spillovers to the Bitcoin market due to patent development. Finally, for most of the companies considered, the calculated spillover effects towards Bitcoin markets are found to increase from the short-term to the long-term. These results suggest the existence of an avenue through which large corporations can influence cryptocurrency prices through their announcements of future technological intentions.

The hard fork, spurred by concerns over Bitcoin's scalability, resulted in an entirely new blockchain and an accompanying new cryptocurrency: Bitcoin Cash. However, the new blockchain relies on the history of transactions recorded on the old blockchain. Consequently, at the time of the hard fork, every holder of Bitcoin could have received an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash. This sudden receipt of Bitcoin Cash poses a variety of tax problems. Should the acquired cryptocurrency qualify as income? If so, how should taxpayers calculate this income? Current income taxation law suggests the Bitcoin/Bitcoin Cash hard fork produced gain that, for the most part, was immediately realized. Thus, most taxpayers that received Bitcoin Cash at the time of the hard fork should have reported its value as income to the Internal Revenue Service. However, due to a variety of practical concerns, including a lack of sufficient analogous situations, cryptocurrency's volatility, and the IRS's refusal to follow relevant regulations related to the taxation of "treasure trove," perhaps it would be best to reconsider this conclusion and explore a solution that permits taxation of Bitcoin Cash upon a subsequent sale.},

We also examine whether cryptocurrencies' returns jump together and the results of various analyses show evidence of co-jumping behaviour, except for a few cases (Ripple and Bytecoin). These results suggest that the presence of jumps in one cryptocurrency increases the probability of inducing a jump in other cryptocurrencies. However, co-jumping is joint with a jumping activity in trading volume. This later result highlights the importance of jumps in trading volume to the formation of jumps in cryptocurrencies, confirming earlier findings on the importance of trading volume to the volatility of cryptocurrencies.},

abstract = {Since the inception of Bitcoin, cryptocurrencies and the underlying blockchain technology have attracted an increasing interest from both academia and industry. Among various core components, consensus protocol is the defining technology behind the security and performance of blockchain. From incremental modifications of Nakamoto consensus protocol to innovative alternative consensus mechanisms, many consensus protocols have been proposed to improve the performance of the blockchain network itself or to accommodate other specific application needs. In this survey, we present a comprehensive review and analysis on the state-of-the-art blockchain consensus protocols. To facilitate the discussion of our analysis, we first introduce the key definitions and relevant results in the classic theory of fault tolerance which help to lay the foundation for further discussion. We identify five core components of a blockchain consensus protocol, namely, block proposal, block validation, information propagation, block finalization, and incentive mechanism. A wide spectrum of blockchain consensus protocols are then carefully reviewed accompanied by algorithmic abstractions and vulnerability analyses. The surveyed consensus protocols are analyzed using the five-component framework and compared with respect to different performance metrics. These analyses and comparisons provide us new insights in the fundamental differences of various proposals in terms of their suitable application scenarios, key assumptions, expected fault tolerance, scalability, drawbacks and trade-offs. We believe this survey will provide blockchain developers and researchers a comprehensive view on the state-of-the-art consensus protocols and facilitate the process of designing future protocols.},

Focusing on a set of historical currencies – Bitcoin, DASH, Litecoin, Monero, Ripple, and Stellar – as well as popular currencies and tokens of the last year (with market capitalization above {\$}0.5 billion), we uncover some surprising results. First, the historical currencies are unanimously inefficient over the analyzed period. Second, efficiency itself and ranking as well are dependent on the denomination (the US dollar or Bitcoin). Third, most of the coins and tokens were efficient between July 2017 and June 2018.

In this study, we conduct a PRISMA guided systematic review of blockchain research in the business literature from 2014 to 2018. Our results show a rapid increase of studies over the five year period. The findings also convey key insights about the current state of scholarly investigation on blockchain, including its top benefits and challenges for business and society.

As forks can be caused by numerous factors such as latency and miner behavior, their analysis provides insights into these factors, which are otherwise unknown. In this paper we provide an empirical analysis of the announcement and propagation of blocks that led to forks of the Bitcoin blockchain. By analyzing the time differences in the publication of competing blocks, we show that the block propagation delay between miners can be of similar order as the block propagation delay of the average Bitcoin peer. Furthermore, we show that the probability of a block to become part of the main chain increases roughly linearly in the time the block has been published before the competing block. Additionally, we show that the observed frequency of short block intervals between two consecutive blocks mined by the same miner after a fork is conspicuously large. While selfish mining can be a cause for this observation, other causes are also possible. Finally, we show that not only the time difference of the publication of competing blocks but also their propagation speeds vary greatly.},

abstract = {Purpose-Trade goods have been used as exchange mediums since the first humans. A thousand years ago currency was invented, and it became the dominant exchange medium in today's world. The history of money did not end with the invention of fiat currency, such as US Dollar or Euro. Cryptocurrency is the new development. It is not a trade good, nor a fiat money. "It is a new, experimental kind of money." In this study our purpose is to analyze the factors influencing investors' decision making on investment in cryptocurrencies by using conjoint analysis. Studies suggest that some attributes of cryptocurrencies affect decisions of investors. In this study, the attributes at different levels related to investors' expectations on cryptocurrencies are examined. Methodology-In this study, conjoint analysis has been conducted. Conjoint method is a statistical analysis method and by using this method researchers determine the value of the attributes of a product or a feature for its consumers. Conjoint analysis is a method for analyzing preferences of customers; it is a useful tool for predicting and determining responses of customers to new product features and totally new products. In this case customers are investors and the new product is cryptocurrencies. Conjoint analysis has several types, choice based conjoint analysis is one of them and it is the preferred method for most of the researchers. Findings-Data collected for the study has been analyzed by using Marketing Engineering for Excel software. The findings of the study indicate that profitability, bookkeeping and security are the most important attributes which influence expectations of investors in cryptocurrencies. Five attributes with five levels each are chosen. It is predicted that these attributes are the most important indicators of investor behavior. According to research findings, most important attribute for investors is profitability. This study confirms that the majority of investors have high profit expectation from crypto currencies. But study results also include some unexpected findings. Anonymity is not one of the main concerns for investors and almost equal number of investors prefers very high and very low level of bookkeeping. Conclusion-The conjoint analysis gives a clear view on what investors expect from cryptocurrencies. The results show the attributes to improve when developing a cryptocurrency.},

Although the parent provided oversight of the child prior to the spin-off, effects of post spin-off links to the child remain unclear. Applying transaction cost and agency theories, our study of 142 firms spun-off between 1986 and 1997 examines how oversight and ownership by the parent firm influence stock market performance post spin-off. We find that while child firms benefit from some links to the parent, having too many links is negatively related to performance. The findings suggest that there is a balance between having too much parental involvement and not enough.

abstract = {In this study, we employ a TVP-FAVAR connectedness approach in order to investigate the transmission mechanism in the cryptocurrency market. To this end, we concentrate on the top 9 cryptocurrencies by virtue of market capitalization and one market factor – based on 45 additional digital currencies – capturing the co-movements in the cryptocurrency market. The period of study spans between August 7, 2015 and May 31, 2018. We find that the dynamic total connectedness across several cryptocurrencies exhibits large dynamic variability ranging between 25{\%} and 75{\%}. In particular, periods of high (low) market uncertainty correspond to strong (weak) connectedness. We show that these results could be explained on the basis of increased market uncertainty that is associated with periods of highly volatile prices. In addition, despite the fact that Bitcoin still influences the cryptocurrency market substantially, we note that, recently, Ethereum has become the number one net transmitting cryptocurrency. We further note that the market gradually becomes more complex considering our connectedness approach and that this might be attributed to the unique characteristics and possibilities inherent in the technology of each cryptocurrency. A simplified application concentrating on bivariate portfolios is indicative of potential hedging opportunities using dynamic hedge ratios and dynamic portfolio weights.},

In sharp contrast to the predictions for other financial markets, we discover that most of the eigenvalues in the spectrum of the cross correlation matrix do not agree with the universal predictions of random matrix theory, but the few of the largest eigenvalues deviate as expected. The minimum spanning tree of cryptocurrency cross correlations reveals distinct community structures that are surprisingly stable.

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine the contemporaneous and causal relationship between returns (volatility) and trading volume in the Indian currency futures market for selected currency pairs; USD-INR, EUR-INR, GBP-INR and JPY-INR, from August 2008 to December 2014. Design/methodology/approach: The data for all the currency futures series has been taken from National Stock Exchange of India Limited which represents the daily settlement prices along with trading volume. The contemporaneous returns-volume relation is tested using the generalized method of moments, and Granger-causality framework impulse response function is used to test the predictive ability of returns (volatility) and volume for each other. Findings: The author reports a positive contemporaneous relationship between futures returns and trading volume which persists even after controlling for heteroskedasticity providing support to mixture of distribution hypothesis. The results show a unidirectional Granger causality from futures returns to volume. However, there is a significant bidirectional Granger causality between returns volatility and volume lending support to sequential arrival of information hypothesis. Next, the results for cross-currencies show significant influence of US dollar on the volume and returns of all other currencies. Overall, the author suggests that the short- to medium-term movements in the currency markets are dominated by market microstructure and not by fundamentals. Practical implications: The findings of this paper are very important for the participants in the market and regulators. The participants in the market require alternatives to diversify their risk. The significant relationship between futures returns (volatility) and trading volume implies that the current trading volume help predict the futures prices and should lead to creation of more reliable hedging strategies for investment purposes. Further, it may interest the regulators who need to decide upon the appropriateness of their policies in the currency futures market. Based on returns-volume relation, they need to set forth market restrictions such as daily price movement and position limits. Originality/value: To the best of the knowledge, no study has yet investigated the forecast ability of trading volume to price changes and their volatility in the Indian currency futures market. Given that currency futures market is one of the largest markets in the world, and Indian rupee has seen wide fluctuations in the recent years, it seems exciting to explore the price-volume relationship in the Indian currency futures market.},

This study adds to the growing body of research on blockchain adoption and blockchain-driven innovation in various fields, including transport, finance, and education. However, the impact of distributed ledger technologies (DLT) on the management of science has not been systematically studied so far. This paper aims to fill the gap by studying the experience of adoption of blockchain-based solutions in academia in 2017–2020. The research is based upon a critical review of projects, relevant literature, and qualitative research: interviews (N = 24) and focus groups (N = 4) with startup founders, scholars, university executives, librarians, and IT experts from the European Union (EU), the United States of America (USA), Russia, and Belarus.

In the context of a traditional industry located in the South of Brazil, this study has analyzed the factors that led a company to invest in creat- ing a corporate spin-off. An analysis framework was developed and turned out the following factor of analysis: (i) Characterization (parent company and spin-off); (ii) Relevant Factors of Spin-off Decision; and (iii) Process (external and internal environment). The framework was applied to a case study and the results show that spin-off creation is an alternative to explore stagnated resources in a parent company upon a market opportunity. Separating the spin-off and integrating it into an innovation environment is a strategy to mitigate the market barriers; while factors such as public policies have limited impact on decision-making, they affect the process of the spin-off creation. The study points out that the creation of a spin-off occurs in a context guided primarily by the opportunity, due to strategic orientation of the parent company. Keywords:},

Then, we use Monte Carlo simulations to generate the conditional variance of the cryptocurrencies using the GJR-GARCH model, and calculate the value at risk (VaR) of the simulations. We also estimate the tail-risk using VaR backtesting. Finally, we use an artificial neural network (ANN) for predicting the prices of the ten cryptocurrencies. The graphical analysis and mean square errors (MSEs) from the ANN models confirmed that the predicted prices are close to the market prices.

Nevertheless, there are few studies which focus on this issue. Furthermore, the influence of factors relating to the business environment which may support or derail improvement efforts is not considered in previous studies. In order to address these limitations, a model is proposed in which the impact of environmental factors is considered by integrating SWOT analysis into the FMEA method in order to support the appraisal of competing risk-based improvement efforts. The impact of SWOT variables is deployed using a decision support model based upon the benefit, cost, opportunity, risk and organisational readiness index (BCOR2) approach in order for the FMEA team to select from competing corrective actions. A case example from industry is provided in which the proposed model is applied. This example illustrates that this new model contributes successfully to good practice by identifying the most appropriate corrective action option to take and improves upon the decisions provided by existing developments of the FMEA methodology.},

abstract = {Cryptocurrencies exhibit high price volatility and a large degree of speculative activity relative to their usage as a means of payment. I present a model to explain these two facts. A cryptocurrency di ers from other assets due to two distinctive features: a price endogenously determined by the extent of its usage as money, and a structure that limits settlement capacity. A cryptocurrency payment is not nal until it is recorded on a ledger, known as a blockchain. Limited blockchain space means that there is competition between speculative and monetary usage. A user can purchase priority by o ering fees to any miner that adds her payment to the blockchain. Speculative pressure can drive these fees up and crowd out monetary uses. This crowding out undermines the ability of a cryptocurrency to serve as a medium of payment, reducing its value and thus its price. A lower price raises the information content of the trade order ow, making the price more volatile. This is the rst paper to endogenise both the nancial market for cryptocurrency, and the fee-based market for blockchain space. I show that prices of cryptocurrencies are inherently more volatile than those of other assets and, more profoundly, that price formation may work fundamentally di erently than for traditional assets. In particular, the demand curve can be locally upward-sloping, because the act of speculation reduces the value of the cryptocurrency.},

abstract = {After ten years of continuous development and innovation, the cryptomarket and the Blockchain technology are
still very much challenged and far from the mainstream adoption. We thus propose a risk assessment, as well as
a market analysis of the Blockchain technology and the cryptomarket. This study is conceived as a two-level
analysis. We first start with the micro-level analysis by performing a detailed risk assessment. Here, we take into
consideration technological issues, such as such as consensus, network, cryptographic primitives, quantum and
smart contract attacks, together with financial concerns such as market, information, liquidity, supply, reputation
and environmental risks. Moreover, we propose ways to determine the probability that technological
vulnerabilities can trigger financial risk. Here, we tackle concepts such as financial behavior, responsible
investment and Blockchain literacy, as possible tools for assessing risk. Then, we complete this study with a
macro-level analysis, which consists of the crypto-market appraisal performed with the Porter's five forces
model. This market analysis is performed with respect to its stakeholders, such as the business process
managers, investors, regulators, firms, developers, miners, hackers, exchange and trading platforms, etc. The
results are relative to: 1. an identified continuity between the technological risks and financial ones; 2. a way to
determine the likelihood of triggering financial risks through technical vulnerabilities; 3. a long-term
profitability of the stakeholders' strategy / position within the market.},

We discuss likelihood ratio tests of cointegration rank and find the asymptotic distribution of the test statistics. We characterize the maximum likelihood estimator of the cointegrating relations and formulate tests of structural hypotheses about these relations. We show that the asymptotic distribution of the maximum likelihood estimator is mixed Gaussian. Once a certain eigenvalue problem is solved and the eigenvectors and eigenvalues calculated, one can conduct inference on the cointegrating rank using some nonstandard distributions, and test hypotheses about cointegrating relations using the $\chi$ {\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater} distribution.

@article{Nawari2019,
abstract = {Blockchain is a relatively new concept that originated from the first cryptocurrency known as Bitcoin and was soon noted to have a much wider range of applications than just serving as the platform for digital cryptocurrency. A blockchain (BC) is essentially a decentralized ledger that records every transaction made in the network, known as a ‘block', the body of which comprises encrypted data of the entire transaction history. The implementation of decentralized technology in any industry would require augmented security, enforce accountability, and could potentially accelerate a shift in workflow dynamics from the current hierarchical structure to a decentralized, cooperative chain of command and affect a cultural and societal change by encouraging trust and transparency. This paper presents an evaluation survey of blockchain technology and its applications in the built environment and examines the potential integration with the BIM process. Moreover, the study explores how employing distributed ledger technology (DLT) could be advantageous in the BIM working environment by reinforcing network security, providing more reliable data storage and management of permissions, and ensuring change tracing and data ownership. The study discusses the basic fundamentals of distributed ledgers, their potential future applications and current advances, and their classification based on inherent characteristics of consensus reaching and permission management. Furthermore, the paper evaluates the potential application of BC technologies in enhancing the framework for automating the construction design review process such as smart contract technologies and Hyperledger Fabric, as well as discussing the pros, cons, and possible future research directions.},

abstract = {It is no exaggeration to say that since the introduction of Bitcoin, blockchains have become a disruptive technology that has shaken the world. However, the rising popularity of the paradigm has led to a flurry of proposals addressing variations and/or trying to solve problems stemming from the initial specification. This added considerable complexity to the current blockchain ecosystems, amplified by the absence of detail in many accompanying blockchain whitepapers. Through this paper, we set out to explain blockchains in a simple way, taming that complexity through the deconstruction of the blockchain into three simple, critical components common to all known systems: membership selection, consensus mechanism and structure. We propose an evaluation framework with insight into system models, desired properties and analysis criteria, using the decoupled components as criteria. We use this framework to provide clear and intuitive overviews of the design principles behind the analyzed systems and the properties achieved. We hope our effort will help clarifying the current state of blockchain proposals and provide directions to the analysis of future proposals .},

abstract = {Canada adopted International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) in 2011. We investigate the impact and consequences of this mandatory change by examining whether value relevance and non-market-based accounting information changed for a comprehensive set of Canadian companies on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX). Our findings reveal the effects of IFRS adoption are not consistent across all firms as demonstrated by a minimal change in value relevance for large firms, but a significant increase for small firms. These differences are primarily attributed to the weakening (strengthening) relationship of book value to stock price for large (small) firms and a strengthening (weakening) relationship of earnings to stock price for large (small) firms. This suggests the goal of IFRS in providing improvement to the balance sheet is only achieved for small firms in Canada. For the non-market-based accounting quality measures of earnings persistence, earnings smoothing, earnings discretion, and the frequency of small profits to losses, the findings are mixed for large firms, but improve for small firms after IFRS adoption.},

The data cover the period from August 1, 2014 to October 31, 2018. Despite the existence of significant interconnectedness between technology sectors worldwide, the results show that contributions from and to the cryptocurrency market are negligible. The cryptocurrency market appears to be less integrated with the technological system and structurally less exposed to systemic risk. To check robustness, application of Fern{\'{a}}ndez-Macho's (2018) wavelet local multiple correlations found an almost exact linear relationship between global technology sectors for periods of quarterly and longer. Additionally, the Granger causality test confirmed the independence results except for in Japan, Turkey and the USA, where possible changes in cryptocurrency prices may be effective in predicting returns. These findings provide insights for cryptocurrency regulators and potential investors around the world.},

It is surprising, though, to see that emerging e-coins have not been mapped into an index yet because with cryptos like Bitcoin, a new kind of asset of great public interest has arisen. Usually, the index provider decides on a fixed number of index constituents which will represent the market segment. It is a huge challenge to set this fixed number and develop the rules to find the constituents, especially since markets change and this has to be taken into account. A method relying on the AIC is proposed to quickly react to market changes and therefore enable us to create an index, referred to as CRIX, for the cryptocurrency market.

Over the next two years, Treynor refined his notes into what is in all likelihood the first CAPM. Treynor gave a copy of this early model to John Lintner at Harvard in 1960. While in business school at Harvard from 1953 through 1955, Mr. Treynor had taken nearly every finance course offered, and though he signed up for Lintner's economics course he was forced to cancel due to a schedule conflict. In 1960, John Lintner was the only economist he knew even slightly. Treynor refined his 1960 model into the 45-page “Market Value, Time, and Risk” [the present paper]. This paper, Treynor (1961), develops the CAPM using the concept of experiment space to quantify risk and risk relations. Without his knowledge or encouragement, one of Mr. Treynor's colleagues sent the draft to Merton Miller in 1961, after Miller had moved to the University of Chicago from Carnegie Institute of Technology. Miller sent the paper to Franco Modigliani at MIT in the spring of 1962, and Modigliani invited Treynor to embark on a program of graduate work at MIT under his supervision. Treynor did so during the 1962-1963 academic year; in addition to Modigliani's course, he took Bob Bishop's price theory and Ed Kuh's econometrics courses, among others. By the fall of 1962, Treynor had consolidated the first part of Treynor (1961), on the single-period model, into “Toward a Theory of Market Value of Risky Assets,” and presented it to the MIT finance faculty. A more complete description of the development of the Treynor CAPM may be found in French, Craig W., The Treynor Capital Asset Pricing Model.

abstract = {We study the dynamics of volatility spillover across four major cryptocurrency returns namely Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple and Litecoin from 15−08−2015 to 18−01−2018. In the first step, an IGARCH (1,1)-DCC (1,1) multivariate GARCH model is estimated to quantify the nature of volatility spillovers. From GARCH results, it is seen that there is statistically significant volatility spillover from Bitcoin to Ethereum and Litecoin during the period of analysis. The conditional correlation measures point towards the possibility of moderate return co-movement among the crypto-currency returns. The conditional covariance measures show negligible volatility spillover during the initial periods and provide evidence towards increased volatility spillover after 2017. Wavelet coherence measures shows evidence towards correlation among the crypto-currencies to be persistent across the short run, while the pairwise wavelet cross-spectral analysis confirms the findings obtained from conditional covariance measures. It is found that other crypto-currencies are influenced by fluctuations in bitcoin prices. Overall, the results indicate the possibility of turbulence in the crypto-currency markets and point towards the possibility of herding behaviour in crypto-currency markets.},

abstract = {The Global Financial Crisis of 2008, caused by the accumulation of excessive financial risk, inspired Satoshi Nakamoto to create Bitcoin. Now, more than ten years later, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), a peer-to-peer financial paradigm which leverages blockchain-based smart contracts to ensure its integrity and security, contains over 702m USD of capital as of April 15th, 2020. As this ecosystem develops, it is at risk of the very sort of financial meltdown it is supposed to be preventing. In this paper we explore how design weaknesses and price fluctuations in DeFi protocols could lead to a DeFi crisis. We focus on DeFi lending protocols as they currently constitute most of the DeFi ecosystem with a 76{\%} market share by capital as of April 15th, 2020. First, we demonstrate the feasibility of attacking Maker's governance design to take full control of the protocol, the largest DeFi protocol by market share, which would have allowed the theft of 0.5bn USD of collateral and the minting of an unlimited supply of DAI tokens. In doing so, we present a novel strategy utilizing so-called flash loans that would have in principle allowed the execution of the governance attack in just two transactions and without the need to lock any assets. Approximately two weeks after we disclosed the attack details, Maker modified the governance parameters mitigating the attack vectors. Second, we turn to a central component of financial risk in DeFi lending protocols. Inspired by stress-testing as performed by central banks, we develop a stress-testing framework for a stylized DeFi lending protocol, focusing our attention on the impact of a drying-up of liquidity on protocol solvency. Based on our parameters, we find that with sufficiently illiquidity a lending protocol with a total debt of 400m USD could become undercollateralized within 19 days.},

abstract = {The present paper investigates the causal link between returns and volume in cryptocurrency markets. Relative to earlier empirical studies on the topic, it employs a flexible methodological approach that allows the intensity and the pattern of the link to vary with the traders' planning horizon (shorter vs longer runs) and the nature of the preceding price shocks (positive vs negative). Causality is bi-directional implying that: (a) volume-based technical analysis can lead to higher profits and (b) trend-following is likely to be a common investment strategy among rational uninformed traders. There is, therefore, scope for establishing appropriate disclosure systems to deal with information asymmetry and the risk associated with it. In the longer-run, spillovers from returns to volume are stronger than those in the opposite direction. The same, generally, applies to spillovers from positive relative to negative returns. Consequently, returns (especially the positive ones) are more likely to induce fundamental changes in traders' expectations compared to volume.},

The objectives of smart cities are to make the best use of public resources, provide high-quality services to the citizens, and improve the people's quality of life. Information and communication technology plays an important role in the implementation of smart cities. Blockchain as an emerging technology has many good features, such as trust-free, transparency, pseudonymity, democracy, automation, decentralization, and security. These features of blockchain are helpful to improve smart city services and promote the development of smart cities. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the literature involving blockchain technology applied to smart cities. First, the related works and background knowledge are introduced. Then, we review how blockchain technology is applied in the realm of smart cities, from the perspectives of smart citizen, smart healthcare, smart grid, smart transportation, supply chain management, and others. Finally, some challenges and broader perspectives are discussed.},

abstract = {This study documents empirical anomalies which suggest that either the simple one-period capital asset pricing model (CAPM) is misspecified or that capital markets are inefficient. In particular, portfolios based on firm size or earnings/price (E/P) ratios experience average returns systematically different from those predicted by the CAPM. Furthermore, the 'abnormal' returns persist for at least two years. This persistence reduces the likelihood that these results are being generated by a market inefficiency. Rather, the evidence seems to indicate that the equilibrium pricing model is misspecified. However, the data also reveals that an E/P effect does not emerge after returns are controlled for the firm size effect; the firm size effect largely subsumes the E/P effect. Thus, while the E/P anomaly and value anomaly exist when each variable is considered separately, the two anomalies seem to be related to the same set of missing factors, and these factors appear to be more closely associated with firm size than E/P ratios. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

abstract = {Managers have repeatedly indicated in surveys that stock splits are intended to improve liquidity. However, previous studies using bid-ask spread and turnover as measures of liquidity find results to the contrary.  This paper offers a new perspective on the issue.  Stock splits can make buying shares more affordable to smaller investors, and split-induced higher trading costs can help attract more brokers to promote the stock and new limit-order traders to supply liquidity.  Accordingly, we hypothesize that managers of firms facing order execution difficulty and lock-in risk have incentives to use stock splits to improve trading speed at the expense of higher trading costs.  Consistent with the hypothesis, we find evidence that firms face trading difficulty prior to splits, and following the split trading speed improves.  On average, about 72 percent of the split announcement returns could be attributed to the net benefit of anticipated trading speed improvement.  Our findings indicate that trading difficulty is an important factor in firms' split decisions, and that the benefit of the improved trading speed outweighs the increased trading costs.},

abstract = {Blockchain is receiving increasing attention from academy and industry, since it is considered a breakthrough technology that could bring huge benefits to many different sectors. In 2017, Gartner positioned blockchain close to the peak of inflated expectations, acknowledging the enthusiasm for this technology that is now largely discussed by media. In this scenario, the risk to adopt it in the wake of enthusiasm, without objectively judging its actual added value is rather high. Insurance is one the sectors that, among others, started to carefully investigate the possibilities of blockchain. For this specific sector, however, the hype cycle shows that the technology is still in the innovation trigger phase, meaning that the spectrum of possible applications has not been fully explored yet. Insurers, as with many other companies not necessarily active only in the financial sector, are currently requested to make a hard decision, that is, whether to adopt blockchain or not, and they will only know if they were right in 3–5 years. The objective of this paper is to support actors involved in this decision process by illustrating what a blockchain is, analyzing its advantages and disadvantages, as well as discussing several use cases taken from the insurance sector, which could easily be extended to other domains.},

abstract = {The blockchain and cryptoasset sector, since coming to the attention of the mainstream business and financial markets during the bitcoin bull run of 2017, continues to accelerate and evolve rapidly. Decentralized finance (DeFi), a new iteration of what was previously referred to as open finance, has emerged as an innovative use case and service enabled by blockchain technology. As with any innovation or new tool, however, there remains a range of questions and considerations that will have to be addressed prior to wider adoption and utilization. This research attempts to contextualize the development of DeFi, frame it within the blockchain and cryptoasset sector, and explain potential obstacles and challenges to further development. Subsequent to this examination of DeFi trends, challenges, and opportunities, a potential framework for further development and implementation will be presented. Outlined and written in a manner approachable to both practitioners and academic users, this research should be used a springboard for further discussion, analysis, and progress.},

abstract = {Bitcoin is emerging as a distinct asset class among investors given its seemingly detached price behavior relative to market and economic fundamentals. Its incomparably high returns in recent years has further fuelled intense interest and investment into Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies at large. This paper cautions that Bitcoin prices, despite their seemingly attractive independent behavior relative to economic variables, may still be exposed to the same types of market risks which afflict the performance of conventional financial assets. Using a Markov regime-switching model to distinguish between regimes of high and low Bitcoin price volatility, this paper shows that while returns on the aggregate market portfolio cannot explain Bitcoin returns, other asset pricing risk factors, such as interest rates and implied stock market and foreign exchange market volatilities, are important determinants of Bitcoin returns. Distinguishing between periods of high and low Bitcoin price volatility reveals heterogeneity in the explanatory power of market risk factors; in particular, Bitcoin returns are more difficult to explain during periods of high volatility relative to periods with low volatility. This finding can partially explain why extant studies, which neglect to distinguish between exchange rate regimes in Bitcoin, have difficulty linking Bitcoin prices to economic fundamentals.},

Blockchain applications are expected to reshape the renewable energy market. However, there is a lack of studies covering the power usage of digital currencies. Therefore, this study ran experiments on mining efficiency of nine kinds of cryptocurrencies and ten algorithms. A comparison of statistical analysis of data in a benchmark and experiment results of Monero mining was conducted. Thereafter, this study provided an estimation of global electricity consumption of the Monero mining activity. The results indicated that the hashing algorithm mainly determines the mining efficiency. Data analysis and experiments and estimated Monero mining electricity consumption in the world and its carbon emission in China as a case study. In 2018, Monero mining may consume 645.62 GWh of electricity in the world after its hard fork. The Monero mining in China may consume 30.34 GWh and contribute a carbon emission of 19.12–19.42 thousand tons from April to December in 2018. Although cryptocurrency mining and blockchain technology are promising, their influence on energy conversation and sustainable development should be further studied.},

abstract = {The underlying transparency of the Bitcoin blockchain allows transactions in the network to be tracked in near real-time. When someone transfers a large number of Bitcoins, the market receives this information and traders can adjust their expectations based on the new information. This paper investigates trading volume and its relation to asymmetric information around transfers on the Bitcoin blockchain. We collect data on 2132 large transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain between September 2018 and November 2019, where 500 or more Bitcoins were transferred. Using event study methodology, we identify significant positive abnormal trading volume for the 15-minute window before a large Bitcoin transaction as well as during and after the event. Using public information about Bitcoin addresses of cryptocurrency exchanges as proxies for information asymmetry, we find that transactions with high levels of information asymmetry negatively affect abnormal trading volume once the event becomes public knowledge, while some effects are even opposite for transactions with lower information asymmetry. The results show that blockchain transaction activity is a relevant aspect of Bitcoin's microstructure, as informed traders make use of the information in general and adjust their expectations based on the degree of information asymmetry.},

abstract = {Considerable attention has recently been given to general equilibrium models of the pricing of capital assets. Of these, perhaps the best known is the mean-variance formulation originally developed by Sharpe (1964) and Treynor (1961), and extended and clarified by Lintner (1965a; 1965b), Mossin (1966), Fama (1968a; 1968b), and Long (1972). In addition Treynor (1965), Sharpe (1966), and Jensen (1968; 1969) have developed portfolio evaluation models which are either based on this asset pricing model or bear a close relation to it. In the development of the asset pricing model it is assumed that (1) all investors are single period risk-averse utility of terminal wealth maximizers and can choose among portfolios solely on the basis of mean and variance, (2) there are no taxes or transactions costs, (3) all investors have homogeneous views regarding the parameters of the joint probability distribution of all security returns, and (4) all investors can borrow and lend at a given riskless rate of interest. The main result of the model is a statement of the relation between the expected risk premiums on individual assets and their "systematic risk." Our main purpose is to present some additional tests of this asset pricing model which avoid some of the problems of earlier studies and which, we believe, provide additional insights into the nature of the structure of security returns. The evidence presented in Section II indicates the expected excess return on an asset is not strictly proportional to its ! " , and we believe that this evidence, coupled with that given in Section IV, is sufficiently strong to warrant rejection of the traditional form of the model given by (1). We then show in Section III how the cross-sectional tests are subject to measurement error bias, provide a solution to this problem through grouping procedures, and show how cross-sectional methods are relevant to testing the expanded two-factor form of the model. We show in Section IV that the mean of the beta factor has had a positive trend over the period 1931-65 and was on the order of 1.0 to 1.3{\%} per month in the two sample intervals we examined in the period 1948-65. This seems to have been significantly different from the average risk-free rate and indeed is roughly the same size as the average market return of 1.3 and 1.2{\%} per month over the two sample intervals in this period. This evidence seems to be sufficiently strong enough to warrant rejection of the traditional form of the model given by (1). In addition, the standard deviation of the beta factor over these two sample intervals was 2.0 and 2.2{\%} per month, as compared with the standard deviation of the market factor of 3.6 and 3.8{\%} per month. Thus the beta factor seems to be an important determinant of security returns.},

abstract = {Tokenization is a new medium to provide digitalization of traditional assets (financial instruments, commodities, currencies, etc) via the use of distributed ledger technology. Substantial regulation of tokenization and crypto-assets have been and will be adopted in OECD countries, which raises the need for legal and economic experts for an assessment of these new issues. This article examines in depth the opportunities and risks raised by initial crypto-asset offerings (ICOs), tokenization and distributed ledger technology in terms of corporate governance, most notably with regard to the role of crypto-asset holders as corporate stakeholders and the tendency towards decentralized (or at least dematerialized) governance of companies. In conclusion, this article concludes that the development of tokenization could lead to changes in the securities' issuance and trading, in the shareholder's involvement and dialogue with companies' management, but also to a reinforcement of the rights granted to the various corporation stakeholders. Besides, the path towards decentralization could not only impact the current state of corporate governance rules, and the nexus of contractual relationships within a firm, but also potentially modify in the long term the current definition of a firm.},

abstract = {White papers are the most important source of information provided to potential ICO in- vestors. We decompose their general textual content into informative and standard contents following the methodology of Hanley and Hoberg (2010). We find that white paper document similarity and the informative and standard contents are related to factors such as the number of industry peers or subjectivity of the text. Analyzing whether information content matters, we find that potential fraud firms adjust information content to the product market environ- ment and varying market conditions. User expert ratings on ICO listing sites are practically unaffected by the information content in white papers. Easy-to-extract information such as team size, having KYC, or the number of social media channels determine expert ratings. This suggests that most expert ratings do not produce any excess information and experts probably even do not read or understand the white paper. Initial listing returns are partly related and trading volume is unrelated to white paper information content. For some of our results, we document differences in the structure of information content in response to variations in ICO market conditions, i.e. ICO wave effects.},

The question that remains however is whether its price movements are linked with its transaction activity - a critical element of its growing market microstructure. Using number of Bitcoin transactions and unique addresses, respectively, to proxy for transaction activity, it is shown that a one standard deviation shock to transaction activity leads to just over a 0.30{\%} gain in returns on the third day following the shock. By the sixth day, there is a reversal in price behavior and any such gains are expunged. When comparing the bidirectional linkages between returns and transaction activity, it is shown here that the contribution of return shocks to transaction activity is quantitatively larger in magnitude.},

After a soft launch in 2009, Bitcoin has evolved into a multi-billion- dollar industry and spawned hundreds of other cryptocurrency systems. Collectively these cryptocurrencies are valued at over {\$}100 Billion in 2017. Bitcoin itself has risen from an initial value of zero (Coins were initially given away) in 2009, to a value of over {\$}15000 in 2017. There have been wide fluctuations in pricing, and several research papers have been written using various valuation methods to attempt to justify and predict the value of Bitcoin. This paper explores the background of what has led to today's valuation and develops a framework to arrive at valuing Bitcoin; the paper also addresses three main questions. Why are traditional valuation methods insufficient to arrive at a valuation of Bitcoin? How can companies and organizations build on the insights developed in this framework for Bitcoin valuation? And finally, the valuation framework is examined through the lens of key stakeholders and offers implications for researchers, investors, and policymakers.},

@phdthesis{Alfieri2019,
abstract = {The innovation introduced by cryptocurrencies and their underlying technology, blockchain, opens new avenues for research in finance. This PhD dissertation proposes three essays on cryptocurrencies, essays that use the theoretical framework of markets' informational efficiency.The first study aims to explain how the blockchain developed in informal communities is adopted and incorporated by organizations. This study uses the contractual and cognitive approaches of the organization theory in order to provide a theoretical framework for the blockchain technology. Through an illustrated literature review, a two-level analysis presents the potential uses of blockchain based on information access for participants. The objective of the second study is twofold. First, it raises the question about the true nature of Bitcoin. After comparing Bitcoin with currencies, gold and common stocks, we base our analysis on the assumption that cryptocurrencies may be assimilated to common stocks. Second, the financial performance (risk-adjusted return) of Bitcoin is empirically assessed using traditional models such as the CAPM and Fama-French three-factor models. We find that while integrating Bitcoin in portfolio highly improves its diversification, it also provides positive and significant risk-adjusted returns in the World, European and Asia-Pacific regions. The high Bitcoin's volatility and performance lead us naturally to focus on the speculative bubble aspect of cryptocurrencies, which is the focus of the third study. The analysis uses the PSY model of Phillips and Shi, 2018. Second, we focus the analysis on the main peak/burst of the cryptocurrency market at the end of 2017 using the Log Periodic Power Law (LPPL) model. The results suggest periods of bubbles implying a contagion effect between cryptocurrencies. The conceptual and empirical findings of this dissertation contribute to prior literature on cryptocurrencies on academic grounds. Our findings are also important for businesses and for investors that are interested in the cryptocurrency and blockchain potential as well as for policymakers in charge of their regulation.},

Disagreements in blockchain communities often lead to splits in both the blockchain and the community. We use three key elements of the actor-network theory — punctualization, translation, and actor heterogeneity—and employ case study methodology to examine Bitcoin splits. We identify several human actors, such as miners, developers, merchants, and investors, as well as non-human actors, including blockchain, exchanges, hardware manufacturers, and wallets, involved in Bitcoin splits. Our results show that the consolidation of actors in homogeneous groups plays a key role in blockchain splits. We further describe how the human and non-human actors' fluid moves into micro and macro actor positions in the network affect the development of the split. In addition, we discuss the roles of these actors and their engagement in forming micro and macro agencies in blockchain splits.},

@article{Shiller1980,
abstract = {My initial motivation for considering volatility measures in the efficient markets models was to clarify the basic smoothing properties of the models to allow an understanding of the assumptions which are implicit in the notion of market efficiency. The efficient markets models, which are described in section II below ,relate a price today to the expected present value of a path of future variables. Since present values are long weighted moving averages, it would seem that price data should be very stable and smooth. These impressions can be formalized in terms of inequalities describing certain variances (section III). The results ought to be of interest whether or not the data satisfy these inequalities, and the procedures ought not to be regarded as just "another test" of market efficiency. Our confidence of our understanding of empirical phenomena is enhanced when we learn how such an obvious property of data as its "smoothness" relates to the model, and to alternative models (section IV below).On further examination of the volatility inequalities, it became clear that the inequalities may also suggest formal tests of market efficiency that have distinct advantages over conventional tests. These advantages take the form of greater power in certain circumstances of robustness to data errors such as misalignment and of simplicity and understandability. An interpretation of volatility tests versus regression tests in terms of the likelihood principle is offered in section V.},

@article{Verhallen1982,
abstract = {Two experiments are performed to test hypotheses derived from commodity theory. Commodity theory promotes a psychological conceptualization of traditionally economic variables such as supply, demand and utility. The theory concerns itself mainly with the effect of restricted availability upon the valuation of communications, but in the present paper the effect of restricted availability and attainability on the preference for material goods (recipe books) is investigated. The first experiment was designed to test the effect of degree of availability (low, middle or high) and cause of unavailability (accidental unavailability, unavailability due to popularity, unavailability due to limited supply and unavailability due to both limited supply and popularity) on the choice between three recipe books in a simulated product test. The results suggest that the theory is valid only for attractive products. For subjects who were not attracted to the product this relationship was reversed (they avoided choosing the scarce product), indicating the arousal of an 'altruism' motive in the experimental setting. The second experiment was designed to test the effect of attainability (attainable, unattainable changed to attainable and unattainable) and cause of unattainability (accidental, popularity, limited supply and both limited supply and popularity) on the same kind of choice. The results again suggest that commodity theory is valid only for subjects attracted to the good, and only for the restricted attainability situation. For subjects not attracted to the product field no treatment effects were found. Commodity theory makes no clear prediction of the effects of unattainability, so reactance theory was used to predict the effects of this variable. The hypothesis that an unattainable good is valued more than an attainable good had to be rejected. A possible explanation based on the occurrence of frustration in this condition is discussed. {\textcopyright} 1982.},

The following notes aim at clarifying the subject by suggesting a uniform and consistent notation, specifying briefly the relations between the different quantities ordinarily used, and summarising the result which have been obtained. The distribution of a variable quantity x can be specified by means of a frequency function f, often termed the probability integral, specifying the total frequency in the population for which the variate is less than an assigned value x. For discontinuous distributions f will be a step function, increasing discontinuously at the values of x at which finite fractions of the total frequency are concentrated, and remaining constant between these values. For certain other distributions f is continuous and differentiable so that df represents the frequency density in the element of range dx, or, the ordinate of a frequency curve at this point. These are the two common cases, but it is also possible for f to be continuous, but not differentiable, and so incapable of representation by a frequency curve.},

Having partitioned the series into periods before and after the 2017/2018 cryptocurrency price crash, as determined by Bitcoin pricing, we obtain some interesting results. Higher persistence of price shocks is observed after the crash, which is probably due to speculative transactions among cryptocurrency traders, and more evidences of non-mean reversions are revealed, implying chances of further price fall in cryptocurrencies. Cointegration relationships between bitcoin and alternative coins exist in both periods, with weak correlations observed mostly in the post-crash period.

abstract = {Blockchain forks can have severe economic implications, sow uncertainty and undermine trust. In this paper, we introduce a formal framework to study the emergence, persistency and economic consequences of blockchain forks. We argue that blockchain forks can be process- or protocol-based and emerge unintentionally or deliberately. We then proceed with a sub-classification of protocol-based forks and study the circumstances under which a chain split may become permanent. It can be shown that the persistency of a fork depends on the nature of the change to the consensus rules and on the relative allocation of the consensus-relevant resources. Lastly, we discuss business implications as well as potential consequences for policy makers and practitioners.},

abstract = {Dynamics of the Bitcoin price as the most prominent cryptocurrency is studied in the light of two fundamental economic laws — the Law of One Price and the Equation of Exchange. Utilizing the unprecedented data availability of Bitcoin statistics, we are able to construct a theoretical exchange rate base of the cryptocurrency with respect to the US dollar. Through the concept of statistical equilibrium verified by the cointegration relationship, we show several interesting points. First, the Bitcoin price dynamics is very well captured by the underlying transaction data which leads to a strong fundamental basis of the cryptocurrency. Second, several historical bubbles hit the confidence intervals around the fundamental price but then start their correction back to the equilibrium. Third, the fundamental price implied by the transaction data is not ever-increasing but reflects the ups and downs of Bitcoin utility in transactions. And fourth, our theory-implied fundamental price suggests that the current (December 2018) Bitcoin price is very close to its fundamental price estimated at around {\$}3,500.},

abstract = {This paper examines the static and dynamic returns connectedness between four renowned DeFi assets, namely, Chainlink, Maker, Basic Attention Token, and Synthetix, and four internationally important conventional currencies, being they Chinese Yuan, Japanese Yen, Euro, and Pound Sterling. We use the time-varying parameter vector autoregressions framework combined with the connectedness approach based on the generalized forecast error variance decomposition. Our static connectedness analysis evidences a low connection of the DeFi markets with the conventional currency markets. The results of our dynamic analysis reveal that the return spillovers are time-varying, with an abrupt increase in connectedness between the DeFi and currency markets in early 2020, during the initial escalation of the pandemic. However, the spillover from the Chinese Yuan to the system does not exhibit any hike due to the COVID-19-triggered meltdown, highlighting a pandemic-caused decoupling of the Chinese financial system from the other centralized and decentralized markets. We observe unprecedentedly high spillovers from the system to the DeFi markets at the beginning of the pandemic. However, we still find that the DeFi markets act predominantly as net innovation transmitters during the first COVID-19 year. Moreover, we detect the existence of a pairwise-like relationship between the net return spillover profiles and report on inversely symmetric profiles for the Maker - Euro, Basic Attention Token - Japanese Yen, and the Chainlink - Pound Sterling pairs. Given the time-varying transmission-reception patterns for all markets, investors and policymakers can make use of our spillover analysis to improve portfolio allocation and regulatory decisions.},

The purpose of this study is to trace an operative algorithm with a long term follow up in a homogenous group of patients affected by Crouzon syndrome. A retrospective review was conducted for all patients affected by Crouzon syndrome who completed the entire surgical sequence. 7 Crouzon patients (4 females, 3 males) completed the entire surgical sequence at different ages: fronto-orbital advancement (0.9 years), LF III distraction osteogenesis (11.5 years) and orthognathic surgery (18 years). The mean age at the last follow up was 19.3 years; normalization of the face was obtained in all cases with improvement of the respiratory problems. After orthognathic surgery, all patients had stable occlusion. A one-year postoperative CBCT scan revealed almost complete ossification of all osteotomy sites. Frontoorbital advancement and modified Le Fort III distraction osteogenesis are reliable surgical procedures. SARME and conventional orthognathic surgery with reductive genioplasty and fat grafting are performed at the end of the surgical sequence to enhance facial aesthetics.},

@article{Hofman2019,
abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to explore a paradoxical situation, asking whether it is possible to reconcile the immutable ledger known as blockchain with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulations (GDPR), and more broadly privacy and data protection. Design/methodology/approach: This paper combines doctrinal legal research examining the GDPR's application and scope with case studies examining blockchain solutions from an archival theoretic perspective to answer several questions, including: What risks are blockchain solutions said to impose (or mitigate) for organizations dealing with data that is subject to the GDPR? What are the relationships between the GDPR principles and the principles of archival theory? How can these two sets of principles be aligned within a particular blockchain solution? How can archival principles be applied to blockchain solutions so that they support GDPR compliance? Findings: This work will offer an initial exploration of the strengths and weaknesses of blockchain solutions for GDPR compliant information governance. It will present the disjunctures between GDPR requirements and some current blockchain solution designs and implementations, as well as discussing how solutions may be designed and implemented to support compliance. Immutability of information recorded on a blockchain is a differentiating positive feature of blockchain technology from the perspective of trusted exchanges of value (e.g. cryptocurrencies) but potentially places organizations at risk of non-compliance with GDPR if personally identifiable information cannot be removed. This work will aid understanding of how blockchain solutions should be designed to ensure compliance with GDPR, which could have significant practical implications for organizations looking to leverage the strengths of blockchain technology to meet their needs and strategic goals. Research limitations/implications: Some aspects of the social layer of blockchain solutions, such as law and business procedures, are also well understood. Much less well understood is the data layer, and how it serves as an interface between the social and the technical in a sociotechnical system like blockchain. In addition to a need for more research about the data/records layer of blockchains and compliance, there is a need for more information governance professionals who can provide input on this layer, both to their organizations and other stakeholders. Practical implications: Managing personal data will continue to be one of the most challenging, fraught issues for information governance moving forward; given the fairly broad scope of the GDPR, many organizations, including those outside of the EU, will have to manage personal data in compliance with the GDPR. Blockchain technology could play an important role in ensuring organizations have easily auditable, tamper-resistant, tamper-evident records to meet broader organizational needs and to comply with the GDPR. Social implications: Because the GDPR professes to be technology-neutral, understanding its application to novel technologies such as blockchain provides an important window into the broader context of compliance in evolving information governance spaces. Originality/value: The specific question of how GDPR will apply to blockchain information governance solutions is almost entirely novel. It has significance to the design and implementation of blockchain solutions for recordkeeping. It also provides insight into how well “technology-neutral” laws and regulations actually work when confronted with novel technologies and applications. This research will build upon significant bodies of work in both law and archival science to further understand information governance and compliance as we are shifting into the new GDPR world.},

We also estimate the optimal weights, hedge ratios, and hedging effectiveness during both sample periods. We find that the return spillovers vary across the two periods for the Bitcoin–Ethereum, Bitcoin–Litecoin, and Ethereum–Litecoin pairs. However, the volatility transmissions are found to be different during the two sample periods for the Bitcoin–Ethereum and Bitcoin–Litecoin pairs. The constant conditional correlations between all pairs of cryptocurrencies are observed to be higher during the COVID-19 period compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Based on optimal weights, investors are advised to decrease their investments (a) in Bitcoin for the portfolios of Bitcoin/Ethereum and Bitcoin/Litecoin and (b) in Ethereum for the portfolios of Ethereum/Litecoin during the COVID-19 period. All hedge ratios are found to be higher during the COVID-19 period, implying a higher hedging cost compared to the pre-COVID-19 period. Last, the hedging effectiveness is higher during the COVID-19 period compared to the pre-COVID-19 period.

On the whole, the results suggest the existence of significant negative effects of cyber attacks on the probability for cryptocurrencies to stay in the low volatility regime. This is an interesting finding, that confirms the importance of gaining a deeper understanding of this form of crime and of the tools used by cybercriminals in order to prevent possibly severe disruptions to markets.},

Active network participants (proposers and validators) are required to stake tokens, and receive payments in return for their services. This property of the PoS system connects cash flows to token holdings, and allows for valuation using conventional methods. As an application of our framework, we analyze security properties of the PoS system. We show that while high token valuation relative to the flow of transactions is central to network security, valuation bubbles have adverse security implications. State-contingent monetary policies can be used to alleviate this problem. We also show how our framework can be extended to the systems with a payment channel network as the second layer.},

We contribute to previous work by proposing surprise volume as a new proxy for private information flow and apply extreme value theory in studying dependence for large volume and return, i.e. under situations of market stress. Results from a GARCH-M model indicate that surprise volume is superior in explaining conditional variance and reveals a positive market risk premium. Under conditions of market stress, the return-volume dependence is weaker, albeit mostly significant. The results for the U.S. market are most pronounced in that surprise volume explains ARCH- as well as leverage-effects and, under market stress, the return-volume dependence remains significant and symmetric. For the European and Asian markets, however, the dependence is weaker with asymmetry under market stress, i.e. small minimal returns show lower volume dependence than large maximal returns. We argue that our results are more consistent with a Gennotte and Leland (1990) misinterpretation hypothesis for market crashes than with cascade or behavioral explanations which associate high volume with steep price declines.},

On the other hand, while the common stock of small NYSE firms appear to have earned substantially higher returns than the common stock of large NYSE firms, the size effect virtually disappears when returns are controlled for differences in risk and E/P ratios.

To shed light on the technology's usage in markets with asymmetric information, this study analyzes the eect of the blockchain's public transparency paradigm on behavioral patterns and market outcomes. In line with prior research, our ndings indicate that the blockchain's shared record mitigates adverse selection eects and reduces moral hazard of good market participants (plums). In addition, we identify an incentive for bad market participants (lemons) to behave opportunistically in the presence of perfect quality information. More specically, the disclosed information allows them to learn about quality dierences between plums and lemons, deceive their counterparties, and move to a new equilibrium with increased utility. As a result, the market collapses despite a welfare gain and future generations are denied market access. In addition, plums and lemons are committed to inecient equilibria following irrational behavior. In total, this study aims to provide initial guidance for blockchain adoption in the context of markets with information asymmetries and highlights risks that arise from competition, the exposure to irrational behavior, and the implementation of services on the infrastructure level.},

Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending. We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network. The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to attack the network, they'll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.},

The rapidly increasing blockchain forks have resulted in fierce competition and created significant controversies in blockchain community. To analyze this competitive aspect, we consider blockchain as a two-sided platform that serves both customers and miners. We develop a game-theoretic model to investigate how a blockchain platform's decision on its settings, such as block size and transaction fee, affects the competition between blockchain platforms as well as the participation behavior of customers and miners. Our findings suggest that increasing the transaction fee alleviates congestion on the platform when customers have a relatively balanced need between efficiency and safety. In contrast, it induces congestion when efficiency is valued over safety. In addition, under hard fork competition, the difference in blockchain platforms' block sizes directs the attention of miners towards different types of mining rewards. Moreover, it also affects the optimal types of customers the blockchain platforms should target. Furthermore, we find that the degree of congestion and the risk attitudes of participants play vital roles in differentiating different block-sized platforms' optimal transaction fees. We provide empirical evidence on the theoretical findings and practical implications for blockchain platform competition with respect to the behaviors of platform participants.},

abstract = {Bitcoin has enabled competition between digital cryptocurrencies and traditional legal tender fiat currencies. Despite rapidly increasing acceptance, so far the affirmation of cryptocurrency as better money has been thwarted by dramatic deflationary price instability. Successful at disposing of any central monetary authority, bitcoin has elected to have a fixed deterministic inelastic monetary policy, establishing itself more as digital gold than as a currency. Price stability could be achieved by dynamically rebasing the outstanding amount of money: the number of cryptocurrency units in every digital wallet is adjusted instead of each single unit changing its value. The apparent awkwardness of this unfamiliar paradigm is discussed at length, proving that its only real novelty is about fairness and effectiveness. Furthermore, suggestions are provided about how to ease the effect of contractionary monetary policy. The proposed monetary base adjustment has neutral impact on the overall wallet wealth, as it does not introduce any arbitrary distortion into the intrinsic value dynamics of the wallet. The adjustment is based on a commodity price index determined with a resilient consensus process that does not rely on central third party authorities. It is posited in this paper that a digital cryptocurrency adopting elastic monetary standard is Hayek Money, so named from the Nobel Prize-winning economist: a good money standard providing stable prices for a new economic era.},

We use a novel approach for the classification of cryptocurrencies with respect to multiple qualitative factors, such as geographical location of headquarters, founder and founder's origin, platform on which the cryptocurrency is built, and consensus algorithm, among others. We identify significant bidirectional causalities between trading volume and returns at different high-frequency intervals; however, those linkages are weakening with decreasing data frequencies. The findings confirm the leading position of the Bitcoin trading volume in the cryptocurrency price formation. This evidence will help investors to design effective trading strategies in cryptocurrency markets providing useful insights from cryptocurrency categorisation.},

While we take stock of the achievements of this rapidly growing field, we identify a gap between two main approaches. The first one studies different sources of systemic risk in isolation, uses confidential data, and inspires targeted but complex regulatory tools. The second approach uses market data to produce global measures which are not directly connected to any particular theory, but could support a more efficient regulation. Bridging this gap will require encompassing theoretical models and improved data disclosure.},

But can decentralized finance be the alternative to the traditional financial system, or has it only created another "technology playground" for users who are biasedly enthusiastic about crypto-assets? The study examines the key definitions of decentralized finance and then synthesizes them to formulate a new, more complete definition. This is followed by a presentation of the different layers of decentralized finance and their prevalence, as well as an analysis of its benefits and risks. In the conclusions, the author finds that decentralized finance has the potential to provide financial services with an open, transparent and robust infrastructure, and has the possibility of reaching a broad range of users with its basic financial services. However, this requires further development of the sector and effective management of emerging risks.},

We show that excess returns are indeed positive for both subsidiary and parent companies over almost all holding periods considered. For subsidiaries the results appear both economically and statistically significant after various adjustments for risk. This evidence is consistent with investors earning an above normal rate of return by investing in recently spun off subsidiaries.

In this article, risk premiums of commodity futures are directly related to the physical scarcity of commodities. For this purpose the authors propose a simple decomposition of spot prices into a pure asset price plus a scarcity related price component. This replaces the traditional convenience yield that results from an imperfect no-arbitrage relationship of the term structure of commodity futures prices. The empirical tests confirm that two separate commodity-specific risk premiums affect the pricing of crude oil futures contracts: a net hedging pressure premium and a scarcity premium. The two premiums show different cyclical characteristics. The authors also find that asset market risk factors such as exchange rates or stock market shocks affect the term structure of oil futures prices in a much more homogeneous way than commodity-specific hedging pressure or scarcity shocks do.

We measure the Bitcoin transaction activity using trading volumes, the number of unique Bitcoin transactions, and the number of unique Bitcoin addresses. Considering the onset of structural breaks, we identify considerable effects of the heterogeneity concerning the quantiles of transaction activity, which cannot be depicted fully by the traditional quantile regression method. The empirical results show that higher transaction activity tends to predict higher/lower Bitcoin returns when the market is in a bullish/bearish state. We find that the nexus is asymmetric across quantiles, depending on the sign and size of the transaction activity, and the predictive relationship intensifies in the upper or lower quantiles of the conditional distribution. In addition, this empirical evidence is in line with the volume-return association in the equity market due to private informative and noninformative trading actions. Overall, our findings suggest that transaction activity-based strategies should be made with respect to Bitcoin market performance, specifically during extreme conditions.},

abstract = {Sustainable and responsible investing (SRI) is a strategy that seeks to combine both financial return and social good. The need to create and preserve SRI represents a key argument in investment decision-making, which leads other firms and investors to make strategic decisions beyond financial logic, based on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors. Within this framework, this paper aims to further clarify the understanding of potentially profitable strategies for firms during a global crisis such as a pandemic. Both primary and secondary data were gathered, and descriptive analyses were conducted. In Spain, several IBEX-35 companies announced donations amid the COVID-19 crisis. First, companies were classified into two groups based on donations made. For this, we searched for ESG online news. Then, profitability records amongst companies were identified and compared. In the trading session after the announcements, we found 12 of the 35 companies that made donations had a higher performance index of more than 2 and 3 points over the companies that did not make donations. With a weekly perspective, the difference was 91 and 60 basis points, respectively. These results suggest that in times of upheaval, investors base their strategy on ESG factors, contributing to the emerging literature on individual motives of SRI. Second, by conducting a survey and collecting data from 575 Spanish citizens, we conclude that after this crisis, people{\&}rsquo;s perceptions towards corporate social responsibility (CSR) will change, affecting consumption preferences in those companies that exhibited socially irresponsible or unsupportive behaviour. Hence, the reputation of firms, their social image, and social trust will play an important role in the near future.},

abstract = {Blockchain technology has attracted considerable attention owing to its wide range of potential applications. It first appeared as a cryptocurrency, called Bitcoin, but has since been used in many other business and nonbusiness applications. Unlike most existing systems that are based on centralized frameworks, this new technology utilizes peer-to-peer networks and distributed systems which includes blockchain registers to store transactions. Its structure is designed as a digital log file and stored as a series of linked groups, called blocks. Each individual block is locked cryptographically with the previous block. Once a block has been added, it cannot be altered. Many security experts speculate that the inherent cryptographic nature of the blockchain system is sufficient to withstand constant hacking and security threats. However, previous studies on the security and privacy of blockchain technology have shown that many applications have fallen victim to successful cyberattacks. Owing to the increasing demand for cryptocurrency and its current security challenges, previous studies have not focused on blockchain technology cybersecurity vulnerabilities extensively. Here, our study extends upon the previous studies on vulnerabilities and investigates the types of potential attacks. Our study then provides further direction to highlight possible countermeasures against blockchain technology vulnerability to cybersecurity.},

Blockchain and distributed ledger technology has drawn increasing attention from both the business and legal communities. This article addresses the potential benefits of blockchain when applied throughout the securitization process. From reduction in cost, time, and fraud risk to increases in certainty, trust, and accuracy, the benefits can be significant. Tracking financial assets on a blockchain can reduce reliance on credit rating agencies and enable investors to follow more closely the performance of assets and calculate associated risk. This should increase confidence for investors and increase interest in the secondary market. By providing a high level of data security, blockchain can also lower the due diligence burden and remove regulatory inefficiencies from the securitization process. Through the elimination of certain third-party intermediaries, blockchain can lower costs and save time. Moreover, by facilitating the use of smart contracts, blockchain can help to consolidate and standardize complicated pooling and servicing agreements and track a servicer's collection activity. We encourage readers to explore blockchain and its potential impact on securitization in further detail.

How decentralized finance will alter company financial services for small and medium-sized enterprises. Last summer, decentralized finance had a renaissance. Bitcoin and ether are becoming more generally recognized as payment methods, and USD Coin (USDC) has made considerable strides toward becoming an asset that will retain its value in the future. Simultaneously, the blockchain technology that underpins cryptocurrencies and the financial infrastructure that supports it are on their way to providing a network of financial railways that runs parallel to-and is linked to-existing financial infrastructure [1] [2]. Both Coinbase and Compound Treasury have launched USDC-based loans that guarantee at least a 4{\%} return (much higher than conventional products of comparable risk), while smaller platforms are providing cross-border capital access at rates that are substantially more variable but otherwise unattainable [3]. Thus far, this expansion of loan products has been driven by the retail sector: people who own and trade crypto-assets for personal purposes [4] [5]. Morgan Stanley and US Bank are now offering cryptocurrency solutions to its wealth management customers [6]. However, how about businesses? DeFi-literally decentralized finance or blockchain-based forms of finance that do not depend on centralized middlemen such as banks-has been embraced to some degree by smaller firms in emerging nations whose demands are not addressed by the conventional banking system. For example, some firms employ payment providers such as BitPesa in Africa, Tranglo in ASEAN, and the main DeFi},

This reputation is in particular attributable to its properties of allowing mutually mistrusting entities to exchange financial value and interact without relying on a trusted third party. A blockchain moreover provides an integrity protected data storage and allows to provide process transparency. In this paper we critically analyze whether a blockchain is indeed the appropriate technical solution for a particular application scenario. We differentiate between permissionless (e.g., Bitcoin/Ethereum) and permissioned (e.g. Hyperledger/Corda) blockchains and contrast their properties to those of a centrally managed database. We provide a structured methodology to determine the appropriate technical solution to solve a particular application problem. Given our methodology, we analyze in depth three use cases-Supply Chain Management, Interbank and International Payments, and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations and conclude the article with an outlook for further opportunities.},

abstract = {Blockchain Technology can enhance the basic services that are essential in traditional finance and it has the potential to become the foundation for decentralized business models, empowering entrepreneurs and innovators with all the right tools. By means of a trustless and distributed infrastructure, blockchain technology is optimizing transactional costs and allows the rise of decentralized, innovative, interoperable, borderless and transparent applications which facilitate open access and encourage permissionless innovations. DeFi stands for "Decentralized Finance" and refers to the ecosystem comprised of financial applications that are being developed on top of blockchain and distributed ledger systems. The Decentralized Finance (DeFi) or Open Finance movement takes that promise a step further. Imagine a global, open alternative to every financial service you use today-savings, loans, trading, insurance and many others-accessible to anyone in the world only by means of a smartphone and internet connection. 322 DeFi is the movement that leverages decentralized networks and open source software to create or transform old financial products into trustworthy and transparent protocols that run without intermediaries.

abstract = {Bitcoin is a popular cryptocurrency that records all transactions in a distributed append-only public ledger called blockchain. The security of Bitcoin heavily relies on the incentive-compatible proof-of-work (PoW) based distributed consensus protocol, which is run by the network nodes called miners. In exchange for the incentive, the miners are expected to maintain the blockchain honestly. Since its launch in 2009, Bitcoin economy has grown at an enormous rate, and it is now worth about 150 billions of dollars. This exponential growth in the market value of bitcoins motivate adversaries to exploit weaknesses for profit, and researchers to discover new vulnerabilities in the system, propose countermeasures, and predict upcoming trends. In this paper, we present a systematic survey that covers the security and privacy aspects of Bitcoin. We start by giving an overview of the Bitcoin system and its major components along with their functionality and interactions within the system. We review the existing vulnerabilities in Bitcoin and its major underlying technologies such as blockchain and PoW-based consensus protocol. These vulnerabilities lead to the execution of various security threats to the standard functionality of Bitcoin. We then investigate the feasibility and robustness of the state-of-the-art security solutions. Additionally, we discuss the current anonymity considerations in Bitcoin and the privacy-related threats to Bitcoin users along with the analysis of the existing privacy-preserving solutions. Finally, we summarize the critical open challenges, and we suggest directions for future research towards provisioning stringent security and privacy solutions for Bitcoin.},

Yet, the boundaries between CeFi and DeFi may not be always so clear cut. In this work, we systematically analyze the differences between CeFi and DeFi, covering legal, economic, security, privacy and market manipulation. We provide a structured methodology to differentiate between a CeFi and a DeFi service. Our findings show that certain DeFi assets (such as USDC or USDT stablecoins) do not necessarily classify as DeFi assets, and may endanger the economic security of intertwined DeFi protocols.

abstract = {Crypto assets have emerged as an increasingly popular asset class among retail and institutional investors. Although initially considered a fringe asset class, their increased adoption across countries—in emerging markets, in particular—amid bouts of extreme price volatility has raised concerns about their potential financial stability implications. This note examines the extent to which crypto assets have moved to the mainstream by estimating the potential for spillovers between crypto and equity markets in the United States and in emerging markets using daily data on price volatility and returns. The analysis suggests that crypto and equity markets have become increasingly interconnected across economies over time. Spillovers from price volatility of the oldest and most popular crypto asset, Bitcoin, to the S{\&}P 500 and MSCI emerging markets indices have increased by about 12-16 percentage points since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, while those from its returns have increased by about 8-10 percentage points. Spillovers from the most traded stablecoin, Tether, to these indices have also increased by about 4-6 percentage points. In absolute terms, spillovers from Bitcoin to global equity markets are significant, explaining about 14-18 percent of the variation in equity price volatility and 8-10 percent of the variation in equity returns. These findings suggest that close monitoring of crypto asset markets and the adoption of appropriate regulatory policies are warranted to mitigate potential financial stability risks.},

The results show a significant average abnormal return of 5.7{\%} on the day of the listing event and 9.2{\%} in the window of three days before until three days after the listing. The effects clearly differ for individual cryptocurrency exchanges, with listings on only a few exchanges yielding significant positive short-term abnormal returns of up to 25.5{\%} on the day of the listing. Other exchanges show no significant effects at all or even significant negative returns, which suggests informed trading or market manipulation. Additional tests show that higher market capitalization in combination with lower trading volume leads to higher abnormal returns at exchange listings of blockchain-based assets.},

A small selection of these tokens obtain listing on a centralized exchange during the sample period, which is accompanied by a significant increase in trading activity, consistent with market segmentation. A centralized listing results in a migration of volume away from decentralized platforms, revealing a strong preference by tokenholders for deeper and more liquid markets over the increased security and anonymity offered by decentralized exchanges.},

The complementarity in the households' participation in the platform acts as an endogenous, yet fragile, fundamental of the cryptocurrency. There exist either two or no equilibria, and the two equilib- ria, when they exist, have disparate properties. When the transaction demand for the platform is unobservable, the trading price and volume of the cryptocurrency serve as important channels for not only aggregating private information about its fundamental, but also facilitating coordination on a certain equilibrium.},

abstract = {The ability to create high-quality software artifacts that are usable over time is one of the essential requirements of the software business. In such a setting, open source software offers excellent opportunities for sustainability. In particular, safeguarding mechanisms against planned obsolescence by any single actor are built into the definition of open source. The most powerful of these mechanisms is the ability to fork the project. In this paper we argue that the possibility to fork serves as the invisible hand of sustainability that ensures that code remains open and that the code that best serves the community lives on. Furthermore, the mere option to fork provides a mechanism for safeguarding against despotic decisions by the project lead, who is thus guided in their actions to consider the best interest of the community. {\textcopyright} 2012 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.},

abstract = {This paper shows that over time, expected market illiquidity positively affects ex ante stock excess return, suggesting that expected stock excess return partly represents an illiquidity premium. This complements the cross-sectional positive return-illiquidity relationship. Also, stock returns are negatively related over time to contemporaneous unexpected illiquidity. The illiquidity measure here is the average across stocks of the daily ratio of absolute stock return to dollar volume, which is easily obtained from daily stock data for long time series in most stock markets. Illiquidity affects more strongly small firm stocks, thus explaining time series variations in their premiums over time. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {As blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies increase in popularity, their decentralization poses unique challenges in network partitions. In traditional distributed systems, network partitions are generally a result of bugs or connectivity failures; the typical goal of the system designer is to automatically recover from such issues as seamlessly as possible. Blockchain-based systems, however, rely on purposeful "forks" to roll out protocol changes in a decentralized manner. Not all users may agree with proposed changes, and thus forks can persist, leading to permanent network partitions. In this paper, we closely study the large-scale fork that occurred in Ethereum, a new blockchain technology that allows for both currency transactions and smart contracts. Ethereum is currently the second-most-valuable cryptocur-rency, with a market capitalization of over {\$}28B. We explore the consequences of this fork, showing the impact on the two networks and their mining pools, and how the fork lead to unintentional incentives and security vulnerabilities.},

On one hand, the banking industry in China is facing the impact of interest rate liberalization and profit decline caused by the narrowing interest-rate spread. On the other hand, it is also affected by economic transformation, Internet development, and financial innovations. Hence, the banking industry requires urgent transformation and is seeking new growth avenues. As such, blockchains could revolutionize the underlying technology of the payment clearing and credit information systems in banks, thus upgrading and transforming them. Blockchain applications also promote the formation of “multi-center, weakly intermediated” scenarios, which will enhance the efficiency of the banking industry. However, despite the permissionless and self-governing nature of blockchains, the regulation and actual implementation of a decentralized system are problems that remain to be resolved. Therefore, we propose the urgent establishment of a “regulatory sandbox” and the development of industry standards.},

The data used in this paper was gathered mainly from Bloomberg Professional Services but also other reliable secondary sources. The Capital Asset Pricing Model is the found to be the preferred method when calculating pricing asset returns due to its simplistic nature. The paper used two different versions of beta for the CAPM Calculation, historical beta and adjusted beta models during periods of 8.5 years, 3 years and 1 year for GOOGL and Silver. Bitcoin periods were based on historical data since it was introduced, the periods that was used were 5.5 years, 3 years and 1 year. Pok{\'{e}}mon Cards used different periods due to lack of consistent data points, the time-periods used were 5 months, 3 months and 1 month. All four assets used the same Risk-free rate which was Treasury Notes 1-year monthly rate. In this paper, various assets, time periods, and betas are used to empirically suggest the ideal way investors can use the CAPM. This research looks at the four different types of assets to predict their returns and what implications the returns have on investment in these assets.},

@article{Woo1989,
abstract = {As corporate America engages in major restructuring programs, spin-offs are becoming a popular option. Several factors increase the chances that a spin-off will succeed. W hen a company voluntarily spins off one of its divisions, the action is viewed as a positive one for both the parent company and its subsidiary. However, this optimism may not be justified. Spin-off performance is not always positive. Certain types of spin-offs enjoy a higher chance of success than if the divisions had stayed with their parents. Before a division is spun off, careful evaluation and preparation is warranted. Under the less stringent, antiregulatory climate of this decade, many corporations have been initiating major restructuring programs that have led to sell-offs, spin-offs and leveraged buyouts. The primary motivation behind these divestitures is to improve competitive position, enhance managerial efficiency, and enhance the firm's economic value in capital markets. Does Performance Improve After a Spin-off? A recent study of thirty-seven voluntary, nonfinancial spin-offs found that performance of a spin-off does not necessarily improve after divestiture. These results are contrary to usual expectations. At first glance, one would think that spin-offs stand to gain from corporate divestiture efforts. As newly established, freestand-ing public corporations, spin-offs can achieve a great measure of autonomy. They are not faced with the challenge of operating under new corporate parents as in the case of sell-offs, nor are they saddled with the large debt-service burdens associated with leveraged buyouts. However , the study revealed new evidence that does not support the usual optimistic expectations for spin-offs. Performance in this study is measured by three ratios: real sales growth, return on sales, and return on assets. A six-year time frame was adopted in this study, comprising the three-year period before the spin-off and the same length of time after the spin-off. The percentage of divisions that enjoyed improvement in performance after the spin-off event is shown in Exhibit 1. The figures reveal that spin-offs were no more likely to report improvements in performance than losses. The percentages of spin-offs that gained in real sales growth, return on sales, and return on assets were 53 percent, 50 percent , and 50 percent, respectively. Hence, it does not appear that the spin-off had a favorable impact on the subsidiary. The first finding from this study suggests that on balance, only one out of two divisions enjoys improvement in performance after spin-off. What accounts for this low rate of success? First, spin-offs are often undertaken to benefit the corporate parent-not the subsidiary. For the parent, the range of reasons behind these spin-offs includes portfolio rationalization, cash generation, elimination of high-risk or low-performing subsidiaries , and securing clearance for future acquisitions. Spin-off candidates often found their resources and competitive positions},

To aid in understanding bitcoin as a network, we demonstrate that bitcoin's medium- to long-term price follows Metcalfe's law. Bitcoin is modeled as a token digital currency, a medium of exchange with no intrinsic value that is transacted within a defined electronic network. Per Metcalfe's law, the value of a network is a function of the number of possible transaction pairs, and is proportional to n2. A Gompertz curve is used to model the inflationary effects associated with the creation of new bitcoin. The result is a parsimonious model of supply (number of bitcoins) and demand (number of bitcoin wallets), with the conclusion bitcoin's price fits Metcalfe's law exceptionally well. Metcalfe's law is used to investigate Gandal's et. al. [2018] assertion of price manipulation in the Bitcoin ecosystem during 2013-2014.},

abstract = {The Bitcoin has emerged as a fascinating phenomenon in the Financial markets. Without any central authority issuing the currency, the Bitcoin has been associated with controversy ever since its popularity, accompanied by increased public interest, reached high levels. Here, we contribute to the discussion by examining the potential drivers of Bitcoin prices, ranging from fundamental sources to speculative and technical ones, and we further study the potential influence of the Chinese market. The evolution of relationships is examined in both time and frequency domains utilizing the continuous wavelets framework, so that we not only comment on the development of the interconnections in time but also distinguish between short-term and long-term connections. We find that the Bitcoin forms a unique asset possessing properties of both a standard financial asset and a speculative one.},

The first transaction, from the fraudster to a merchant, is included in a block of the public chain. The second transaction, from the fraudster to himself, is recorded in a block that integrates a private chain, exact copy of the public chain up to substituting the fraudster-to-merchant transaction by the fraudster-to-fraudster transaction. The double-spending hack is completed once the private chain reaches the length of the public chain, in which case it replaces it. The growth of both chains are modelled by two independent counting processes. The probability distribution of the time at which the malicious chain catches up with the honest chain, or, equivalently, the time at which the two counting processes meet each other, is studied. The merchant is supposed to await the discovery of a given number of blocks after the one containing the transaction before delivering the goods. This grants a head start to the honest chain in the race against the dishonest chain.},

abstract = {Cryptocurrencies are often thought to operate out of the reach of national regulation, but in fact their valuations, transaction volumes and user bases react substantially to news about regulatory actions. The impact depends on the specific regulatory category to which the news relates: events related to general bans on cryptocurrencies or to their treatment under securities law have the greatest adverse effect, followed by news on combating money laundering and the financing of terrorism, and on restricting the interoperability of cryptocurrencies with regulated markets. News pointing to the establishment of specific legal frameworks tailored to cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings coincides with strong market gains. These results suggest that cryptocurrency markets rely on regulated financial institutions to operate and that these markets are segmented across jurisdictions, bringing cryptocurrencies within reach of national regulation. Cryptocurrencies 2 such as Bitcoin 3 or Ethereum have attracted much attention, because of both meteoric price swings and their advocates' claim of a new model of decentralised trust. Many are analysing the validity of such claims and the economics of the underlying technology (Biais et al Shin for their comments. The views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect those of the BIS. This special feature uses text excerpts from BIS (2018). 2 Terminology on this topic is fluid and evolving, with related legal and regulatory ambiguities. The use of the term "cryptocurrencies" in this special feature is not meant to indicate any particular view of what the underlying protocol-based systems are; typically, they lack the key attributes of a sovereign currency and their legal treatment varies across jurisdictions. In some cases, the feature refers to specific cryptocurrencies or cryptoassets as examples. These examples are not exhaustive and do not constitute any endorsement by the authors, the BIS, or its shareholders of any cryptocurrency, firm, product or service. 3 We distinguish between the protocol and network of users and miners of a cryptocurrency, and the unit of a cryptocurrency.

In addition, academics increasingly acknowledge the predictive power of Twitter for a wide variety of events and more specifically for financial markets. This paper studies to what extent public Twitter sentiment can be used to predict price returns for the nine largest cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Bitcoin Cash, EOS, Litecoin, Cardano, Stellar and TRON. By using a cryptocurrency-specific lexicon-based sentiment analysis approach, financial data and bilateral Granger-causality testing, it was found that Twitter sentiment has predictive power for the returns of Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin. Using a bullishness ratio, predictive power is found for EOS and TRON. Finally, a heuristic approach is developed to discover that at least 1–14{\%} of the obtained Tweets were posted by Twitter “bot” accounts. This paper is the first to cover the predictive power of Twitter sentiment in the setting of multiple cryptocurrencies and to explore the presence of cryptocurrency-related Twitter bots.},

This result is largely comparable for cryptocurrency and stock markets despite the fact that both markets are fundamentally different. However, the returns of an overreaction trading strategy are significantly higher for cryptocurrencies due to larger overreactions as the most important factor for profitability. In addition, our results also show that negative overreactions are slightly more prevalent than positive overreactions.},

The path forward for truly blockchain-native financial applications, therefore, must involve the integration of real-world identity information in order to disincentivize defection. We discuss several potential technologies for doing so, and conclude that such integration is possible without compromising pseudonymity, provided real-world identity is available in the breach.},

@article{Xu2019,
abstract = {Cryptocurrency has attracted extraordinary attention as one of the greatest financial innovations in recent years. Equally noticeable are the increasingly frequent cryptocurrency events, such as hard forks. Put simply, a cryptocurrency hard fork happens when a single cryptocurrency splits in two, which results in original coin owners receiving free forked coins. Such hard forks have resulted in billions of dollars distributed to U.S. taxpayers. Despite ongoing regulatory efforts, to date, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has yet to take a clear position on the tax treatment of cryptocurrency hard forks. The lack of useful guidance when filing tax returns has left taxpayers genuinely confused in the past few years. To fill this regulatory gap, this Note proposes a framework for cryptocurrency hard fork taxation. It explains the underlying technology of cryptocurrency hard forks, examines the recommended guidelines from the American Bar Association and the Association of International Certified Professional Accountants on cryptocurrency hard fork taxation, and references the current practices in Japan and the United Kingdom to lay a solid foundation for the proposed framework. Ultimately, this Note proposes a two-pronged tax on cryptocurrency hard forks. The first tax is levied on the profit made from the receipt of forked coins, and the second tax is levied on the profit made from the disposition of forked coins. A concrete proposal is provided for the applicable coin valuation, tax basis, holding period, and tax rate for the two prongs. Aiming to propose a tax treatment that is closest to the nature of cryptocurrency hard forks, this proposal considers various practical concerns, such as the inefficiency of the cryptocurrency market, the indirect possession of forked coins through third-party exchanges, and the fluctuating trading prices of forked coins when determining the valuation, tax basis, and holding period. This proposal not only provides clarity for taxpayers in filing tax returns and fulfilling tax obligations, but it also relieves the potential tax deferral and tax evasion problems that arise after a cryptocurrency hard fork.},

Index providers decide on a fixed number of index constituents which will represent the market segment. It is a challenge to fix a number and develop rules for the constituents in view of the market changes. In the frequently changing CC market, this challenge is even more severe. A method relying on the AIC is proposed to quickly react to market changes and therefore enable us to create an index, referred to as CRIX, for the cryptocurrency market. CRIX is chosen by model selection such that it represents the market well to enable each interested party studying economic questions in this market and to invest into the market. The diversified nature of the CC market makes the inclusion of altcoins in the index product critical to improve tracking performance. We have shown that assigning optimal weights to altcoins helps to reduce the tracking errors of a CC portfolio, despite the fact that their market cap is much smaller relative to Bitcoin.

abstract = {This paper studied the effect of the bifurcation of Bitcoin on its interactions with its substitute, Litecoin. We applied the Granger causality test and a BEKK-MGARCH model to investigate the return and volatility spillovers between Bitcoin and Litecoin during the period 2013–2018. We divided this period by the date of August 1, 2017, on which Bitcoin underwent its initial bifurcation. In general, our empirical results show that return and volatility spillovers run in one direction only, i.e., from Bitcoin to Litecoin, before the bifurcation, with the direction of shock transmission being reversed after the bifurcation. We conclude that bifurcation has markedly weakened the market position and pricing influence of Bitcoin within cryptocurrency markets. Since bifurcation is convenient for nearly any cryptocurrency, it will likely continue to pose a risk to the cryptocurrency market as a whole.},

These are: loss of diversification (portfolio effect), change in growth opportunities, change in operational efficiency, and the flow and assimilation of information (information effect).  The relevance of each channel depends on the mode of a breakup.  We explain conceptually and show empirically, using a sample of 530 breakups (259 spinoffs and 271 equity carveouts), that the portfolio effect is dominant for spinoff parents, while the information effect gains importance for carveout parents.  Our novel insight is that the magnitude of the information effect depends on the pre-announcement information set held by investors; we provide a simple state-space model and empirical evidence to support this intuition.  We also find a relation between the change in operational efficiency and the change in idiosyncratic volatility for spinoff parents.},

abstract = {Using the concept of the stochastic discount factor with critical behavior, we present a self-consistent model for explosive financial bubbles, which combines a mean-reverting volatility process and a stochastic conditional return which reflects nonlinear positive feedbacks and continuous updates of the investors' beliefs and sentiments. The conditional expected returns exhibit faster-than-exponential acceleration decorated by accelerating oscillations, called "log-periodic power law" (LPPL). Tests on residuals show a remarkable, low rate (0.2{\%}) of false positives when applied to a GARCH benchmark. When tested on the S{\&}P500 US index from Jan. 3, 1950 to Nov. 21, 2008, the model correctly identifies the bubbles ending in Oct. 1987, in Oct. 1997, and in Aug. 1998 and the ITC bubble ending on the first quarter of 2000. Different unit-root tests confirm the high relevance of the model specification. Our model also provides a diagnostic for the duration of bubbles: applied to the period before the Oct. 1987 crash, there is clear evidence that the bubble started at least 4. years earlier. We confirm the validity and universality of the volatility-confined LPPL model on seven other major bubbles that have occurred in the World in the last two decades. Using Bayesian inference, we find a very strong statistical preference for our model compared with a standard benchmark, in contradiction with Chang and Feigenbaum (2006) which used a unit-root model for residuals. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Inc.},

@article{Jensen1968,
abstract = {In this paper I derive a risk-adjusted measure of portfolio performance (now known as "Jensen's Alpha") that estimates how much a manager's forecasting ability contributes to the fund's returns. The measure is based on the theory of the pricing of capital assets by Sharpe (1964), Lintner (1965a) and Treynor (Undated). I apply the measure to estimate the predictive ability of 115 mutual fund managers in the period 1945-1964—that is their ability to earn returns which are higher than those we would expect given the level of risk of each of the portfolios. The foundations of the model and the properties of the performance measure suggested here are discussed in Section II. The evidence on mutual fund performance indicates not only that these 115 mutual funds were on average not able to predict security prices well enough to outperform a buy-the-market-and-hold policy, but also that there is very little evidence that any individual fund was able to do significantly better than that which we expected from mere random chance. It is also important to note that these conclusions hold even when we measure the fund returns gross of management expenses (that is assume their bookkeeping, research, and other expenses except brokerage commissions were obtained free). Thus on average the funds apparently were not quite successful enough in their trading activities to recoup even their brokerage expenses.},

abstract = {In the past decade, Bitcoin as an emerging asset class has gained widespread public attention because of their extraordinary returns in phases of extreme price growth and their unpredictable massive crashes. We apply the log-periodic power law singularity (LPPLS) confidence indicator as a diagnostic tool for identifying bubbles using the daily data on Bitcoin price in the past two years. We find that the LPPLS confidence indicator based on the daily Bitcoin price data fails to provide effective warnings for detecting the bubbles when the Bitcoin price suffers from a large fluctuation in a short time, especially for positive bubbles. In order to diagnose the existence of bubbles and accurately predict the bubble crashes in the cryptocurrency market, this study proposes an adaptive multilevel time series detection methodology based on the LPPLS model and a finer (than daily) timescale for the Bitcoin price data. We adopt two levels of time series, 1 h and 30 min, to demonstrate the adaptive multilevel time series detection methodology. The results show that the LPPLS confidence indicator based on this new method is an outstanding instrument to effectively detect the bubbles and accurately forecast the bubble crashes, even if a bubble exists in a short time. In addition, we discover that the short-term LPPLS confidence indicator being highly sensitive to the extreme fluctuations of Bitcoin price can provide some useful insights into the bubble status on a shorter time scale – on a day to week scale, while the long-term LPPLS confidence indicator has a stable performance in terms of effectively monitoring the bubble status on a longer time scale – on a week to month scale. The adaptive multilevel time series detection methodology can provide real-time detection of bubbles and advanced forecast of crashes to warn of the imminent risk in not only the cryptocurrency market but also other financial markets.},

This is the first study of the whole cryptocurrency market structure. It introduces several rigorous innovative methodologies applicable to this and to several other complex systems where a large number of variables interact in a non-linear way, which is a distinctive feature of the digital economy. The analysis of the dependency structure reveals that prices are significantly correlated with sentiment. The major, most capitalised cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, have a central role in the price correlation network but only a marginal role in the sentiment network and in the network describing the interactions between the two. The study of the causality structure reveals a causality network that is consistently related with the correlation structures and shows that both prices cause sentiment and sentiment cause prices across currencies with the latter being stronger in size but smaller in number of significative interactions. Overall our study uncovers a complex and rich structure of interrelations where prices and sentiment influence each other both instantaneously and with lead-lag causal relations. A major finding is that minor currencies, with small capitalisation, play a crucial role in shaping the overall dependency and causality structure. Despite the high level of noise and the short time-series we verified that these networks are significant with all links statistically validated and with a structural organisation consistently reproduced across all networks.},

abstract = {The Bitcoin cryptocurrency records its transactions in a public log called the blockchain. Its security rests critically on the distributed protocol that maintains the blockchain, run by participants called miners. Conventional wisdom asserts that the mining protocol is incentive-compatible and secure against colluding minority groups, that is, it incentivizes miners to follow the protocol as prescribed. We show that the Bitcoin mining protocol is not incentive-compatible. We present an attack with which colluding miners' revenue is larger than their fair share. The attack can have significant consequences for Bitcoin: Rational miners will prefer to join the attackers, and the colluding group will increase in size until it becomes a majority. At this point, the Bitcoin system ceases to be a decentralized currency. Unless certain assumptions are made, selfish mining may be feasible for any coalition size of colluding miners. We propose a practical modification to the Bitcoin protocol that protects Bitcoin in the general case. It prohibits selfish mining by a coalition that command less than 1/4 of the resources. This threshold is lower than the wrongly assumed 1/2 bound, but better than the current reality where a coalition of any size can compromise the system.},

This particularly applies to domains involving integer factorization and discrete logarithms, such as public key cryptography. I n this paper, we consider the threats a quantum-capable adversary could impose on Bitcoin, which currently uses the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) to sign transactions. We then propose a simple but slow commit-delay-reveal protocol, which allows users to securely move their funds from old (non-quantum-resistant) outputs to those adhering to a quantum-resistant digital signature scheme. The transition protocol functions even if ECDSA has already been compromised. While our scheme requires modifications to the Bitcoin protocol, these can be implemented as a soft fork.},

Since smart contracts handle and transfer assets of considerable value, besides their correct execution it is also crucial that their implementation is secure against attacks which aim at stealing or tampering the assets. We study this problem in Ethereum, the most well-known and used framework for smart contracts so far. We analyse the security vulnerabilities of Ethereum smart contracts, providing a taxonomy of common programming pitfalls which may lead to vulnerabilities. We show a series of attacks which exploit these vulnerabilities, allowing an adversary to steal money or cause other damage.},

abstract = {Lending pools are decentralized applications which allow mutually untrusted users to lend and borrow crypto-assets. These applications feature complex, highly parametric incentive mechanisms to equilibrate the loan market. This complexity makes the behaviour of lending pools difficult to understand and to predict: indeed, ineffective incentives and attacks could potentially lead to emergent unwanted behaviours. Reasoning about lending pools is made even harder by the lack of executable models of their behaviour: to precisely understand how users interact with lending pools, eventually one has to inspect their implementations, where the incentive mechanisms are intertwined with low-level implementation details. Further, the variety of existing implementations makes it difficult to distill the common aspects of lending pools. We systematize the existing knowledge about lending pools, leveraging a new formal model of interactions with users, which reflects the archetypal features of mainstream implementations. This enables us to prove some general properties of lending pools, and to precisely describe vulnerabilities and attacks. We also discuss the role of lending pools in the broader context of decentralized finance and identify relevant research challenges.},

We look at the properties of crypto-currencies as financial assets in a broad cross-section. We discuss approaches of altcoins to generate value and their trading and information platforms. Then we investigate crypto-currencies as alternative investment assets, studying their returns and the co-movements of altcoin prices with bitcoin and against each other. We evaluate their addition to investors' portfolios and document they are indeed able to enhance the diversification of portfolios due to their little co-movements with established assets, as well as with each other. Furthermore, we evaluate pure portfolios of crypto-currencies: an equally-weighted one, a value-weighted one, and one based on the CRypto-currency IndeX (CRIX). The CRIX portfolio displays lower risk than any individual of the liquid crypto-currencies. We also document the changing characteristics of the crypto-currency market. Deepening liquidity is accompanied by a rise in market value, and a growing number of altcoins is contributing larger amounts to aggregate crypto-currency market capitalization.},

abstract = {Our legacy financial infrastructure has both limited growth opportunities and contributed to the inequality of opportunities. Around the world, 1.7 billion are unbanked. Small businesses, even those with a banking relationship, often must rely on high-cost financing, such as credit cards, because traditional banking excludes them from loan financing. High costs also impact retailers who lose 3{\%} on every credit card sales transaction. These total costs for small businesses are enormous by any metric. The result is less investment and decreased economic growth. Decentralized finance, or DeFi, poses a challenge to the current system and offers a number of potential solutions to the problems inherent in the traditional financial infrastructure. While there are many fintech initiatives, we argue that the ones that embrace the current banking infrastructure are likely to be fleeting. We argue those initiatives that use decentralized methods-in particular blockchain technology-have the best chance to define the future of finance.

abstract = {In the last decade, blockchain has emerged as one of the most influential innovations in software architecture and technology. Ideally, blockchains are designed to be architecturally and politically decentralized, similar to the Internet. In recent times, however, blockchain-based systems have faced stumbling blocks in the form of challenges related to scalability, privacy, security, etc. Several new methods have been proposed both by the research and professional communities to mitigate these challenges. One such recent advancement proposed is the use of sidechains. A sidechain is a secondary blockchain connected to the main blockchain with a two-way peg. Sidechains may have their own consensus protocols, which could be completely different from the mainchain's protocol. Theoretically, a sidechain can add new functionalities, improve privacy, and security of traditionally vanilla blockchains. To this date, however, little is known or discussed regarding factors related to design choices, feasibility, limitations and other issues in adopting the sidechain technology. Moreover, there is a lack of studies discussing how and where it can effectively be integrated into blockchains to remedy current issues in a clear context. Hence, this paper provides the first comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art sidechains and platforms, identifying current advancements and analyzing their impact from various viewpoints, highlighting their limitations and discussing possible remedies for the overall improvement of the blockchain domain.},

Using a generalized Metcalfe's law based on network properties, a fundamental value is quantified and shown to be heavily exceeded, on at least four occasions, by bubbles that grow and burst. In these bubbles, we detect a universal super-exponential unsustainable growth. We model this universal pattern with the Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) model, which parsimoniously captures diverse positive feedback phenomena, such as herding and imitation. The LPPLS model is shown to provide an ex-ante warning of market instabilities, quantifying a high crash hazard and probabilistic bracket of the crash time consistent with the actual corrections; although, as always, the precise time and trigger (which straw breaks the camel's back) being exogenous and unpredictable. Looking forward, our analysis identifies a substantial but not unprecedented overvaluation in the price of bitcoin, suggesting many months of volatile sideways bitcoin prices ahead (from the time of writing, March 2018).},

abstract = {With the increase in the attention to cryptocurrency, studies on the factors affecting the price fluctuation of cryptocurrency have been actively conducted. Prior researches suggested that policy announcements (i.e., public information) related to cryptocurrency have been found to affect the price volatility in the market in particular. Privileged information, which is hard to be observable unlike public information published by the government or corporations, is hardly homogenously distributed to individual investors. However, it inevitably affects the price in any market. Therefore, this study aims to identify the information asymmetry, which is mainly formed by privileged information, in the cryptocurrency market. Moreover, this study examines whether investment sentiment, which mainly influences transaction behaviors of uninformed traders, has a significant effect on the cryptocurrency market as well. The results contribute to the understanding of the cryptocurrency market in a basis of the existing market theories.},

Using the methodological approach proposed by Ando et al. (2022), we compare connectedness results at extreme (lower and upper) quantile levels. DeFis and traditional bank stocks may show positive but low spillovers, thus DeFi lending tokens would constitute a new commercial banking asset class. In addition, the tails of the distribution would show excess return (static and dynamic) spillover compared to the mean and median, indicating an increased sensitivity in the extreme market conditions (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), especially in the left tail. The dynamic net spillovers may vary over time for all markets and increase during periods of uncertainty, in line with very recent studies. Also, RTD (Relative Tail Dependence) rejects quasy-symmetry due to its time-variation, ranging between positive and negative values. Therefore, traders and portfolio managers would need to adjust their positions depending on the time-varying net spillovers.},

When compared with the matched firm benchmark used by Cusatis et al. and the Fama and French (1993) 3-factor model, the strategy does not beat the benchmark. When compared with size- and book-to-market-matched portfolios, the strategy typically beats the benchmark.

This contradicts other, more recent, results on the matter. One reason is that we apply a longer sample than previous studies.

For an in-depth analysis, this study uses the quantile regression approach to examine the determinants of efficient markets. The results show that all markets present evidence of long-memory property and multifractality. Furthermore, the inefficiency of cryptocurrency markets is time-varying, and Dash is the least inefficient market while Litecoin is the most inefficient. Finally, we find that higher liquidity improves but higher volatility weakens the efficiency of cryptocurrencies, depending on the quantiles. Therefore, we conclude that high liquidity with low volatility helps active traders to arbitrage away opportunities, resulting in market efficiency.},

Moreover, Fama-Macbeth regressions show the size and momentum combine to capture the cross-sectional variation in average cryptocurrency returns. In the tests of the three-factor model, we find most cryptocurrencies and their portfolios have significant exposures to the proposed three factors with insignificant intercepts, demonstrating that the three factors explain average cryptocurrency returns very well.},

abstract = {Blockchain and other Distributed Ledger Technologies (DLTs) have evolved significantly in the last years and their use has been suggested for numerous applications due to their ability to provide transparency, redundancy and accountability. In the case of blockchain, such characteristics are provided through public-key cryptography and hash functions. However, the fast progress of quantum computing has opened the possibility of performing attacks based on Grover's and Shor's algorithms in the near future. Such algorithms threaten both public-key cryptography and hash functions, forcing to redesign blockchains to make use of cryptosystems that withstand quantum attacks, thus creating which are known as post-quantum, quantum-proof, quantum-safe or quantum-resistant cryptosystems. For such a purpose, this article first studies current state of the art on post-quantum cryptosystems and how they can be applied to blockchains and DLTs. Moreover, the most relevant post-quantum blockchain systems are studied, as well as their main challenges. Furthermore, extensive comparisons are provided on the characteristics and performance of the most promising post-quantum public-key encryption and digital signature schemes for blockchains. Thus, this article seeks to provide a broad view and useful guidelines on post-quantum blockchain security to future blockchain researchers and developers.},

This research shows that Bitcoin prices exhibit long term memory, although its trend has been reducing overtime. In fact, assessing Bitcoin, Ethereum and Ripple across the period between 2016 and 2017, focusing solely on the period prior to the crash of 2018, we can conclude that Bitcoin was better described by a random walk, showing signs of markets maturity emerging, in contrast, other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum and Ripple present evidence of a growing underlying memory behaviour.},

abstract = {Cryptocurrencies present a relatively new field of study where not much research has been done on the effects of announcements on cryptocurrency returns. This thesis examines the effect of hard fork and airdrop announcements on cryptocurrency returns using the event study methodology. Fork and airdrop announcements are studied on 22 cryptocurrencies from the top 100 cryptocurrencies ranked by their market capitalization and the results show that average abnormal returns are not statistically significant on the day of the announcement which is in stark contrast to most of the evidence from the stock markets and implies market inefficiency due to a 2 day lag before average abnormal returns become statistically significant. Our interpretation of the results is that information on cryptocurrencies are very confusing and unreliable and investors wait for their confirmation, hence the two day delay},

It is therefore of particular interest whether cryptocurrencies can form a new asset class or need to be subsumed under an existing one. We find that cryptocurrencies show characteristics of a distinct asset class based on strong internal correlation, an absence of correlation with any traditional asset class as well as sufficient market liquidity, while market stability has room for improvement. Adding cryptocurrency to traditional portfolio structures may lead to significant and persistent risk-adjusted outperformance. These results support the careful introduction of cryptocurrencies into the asset management mainstream.},

abstract = {This paper examines the benefits and constraints of applying blockchain technology for the Paris Agreement carbon market mechanism and develops a list of technical requirements and soft factors as selection criteria to test the feasibility of two different blockchain platforms. The carbon market mechanism, as outlined in Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, can accelerate climate action by enabling cooperation between national Parties. However, in the past, carbon markets were limited by several constraints. Our research investigates these constraints and translates them into selection criteria to design a blockchain platform to overcome these past limitations. The developed selection criteria and assumptions developed in this paper provide an orientation for blockchain assessments. Using the selection criteria, we examine the feasibility of two distinct blockchains, Ethereum and Hyperledger Fabric, for the specific use case of Article 6.2. These two blockchain systems represent contrary forms of design and governance; Ethereum constitutes a public and permissionless blockchain governance system, while Hyperledger Fabric represents a private and permissioned governance system. Our results show that both blockchain systems can address present carbon market constraints by enhancing market transparency, increasing process automation, and preventing double counting. The final selection and blockchain system implementation will first be possible, when the Article 6 negotiations are concluded, and governance preferences of national Parties are established. Our paper informs about the viability of different blockchain systems, offers insights into governance options, and provides a valuable framework for a concrete blockchain selection in the future.},

abstract = {Cyber risks pose unique threats to financial stability that are not well understood or managed, despite growing investment in research and dependence by financial institutions, consumers, and governments on cyber technol- ogies. This paper considers the ways in which cyber risks differ from traditional financial shocks. In contrast to the financial and policy shocks that have triggered past financial panics, cyber attacks are generally designed and initiated by sentient adversaries in aggressive pursuit of specific malicious goals. If one of those goals is broad financial system instability, a cyber attack may pose unique challenges. Unfortunately, the interactions between the financial contagion channels and the technological and operational risk channels of cyber attacks have not been examined carefully. For example, a sustained attack on a large global financial institution could be contagious across both dimensions, but where and how the contagion chan- nels might feed on each other and accelerate risk is an important area for future work. This paper starts by examining traditional risks to financial stability, such as contagion from excessive leverage. It also examines the current regulatory frameworks and partnerships, both domestic and international, established to increase the resilience of the financial system to cyber risk. The analysis concludes with major concerns and potential gaps in understanding and mitigating cyber risks to financial stability.},

abstract = {Aim/Purpose This paper explored the factors (enablers and barriers) that affect Bitcoin adop- tion in South Africa, a Sub-Saharan country with the high potential for Bitcoin adoption. Background Methodology Contribution Findings In recent years, Bitcoin has seen a rapid growth as a virtual cryptocurrency throughout the world. Bitcoin is a protocol which allows value to be exchanged over the internet without a central bank or intermediary. Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin are technological tools that arguably can contribute to reducing trans- actions costs. This paper explored the factors that affect Bitcoin adoption in South Africa, a Sub-Saharan country with the high potential for Bitcoin adop- tion, as little is known about the factors that affect Bitcoin adoption and the barriers to adoption. A quantitative questionnaire was distributed to South African virtual communi- ties where Bitcoin is a topic of interest, and 237 quantitative responses were received, along with 212 open-ended comments. This research contributes to the body of knowledge in information systems by providing insights into factors that affect Bitcoin adoption in South Africa. It raises awareness of incentives and barriers to Bitcoin adoption at a time when financial literacy is a crucial issue both in South Africa and worldwide. The results indicate that perceived benefit, attitude towards Bitcoin, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control directly affected the participants' inten- tions to use Bitcoin. Perceived benefit, usefulness, ease of use, and trust-related risk were found to indirectly affect intention to use Bitcoin. Further, it emerges that the barriers to Bitcoin adoption in South Africa consist of the complex nature of Bitcoin and its high degree of volatility.},

These price deviations are much larger across than within countries, and smaller between cryptocurrencies, highlighting the importance of capital controls for the movement of arbitrage capital. Price deviations across countries co-move and open up in times of large bitcoin appreciation. Countries with higher bitcoin premia over the US bitcoin price see widening arbitrage deviations when bitcoin appreciates. Finally, we decompose signed volume on each exchange into a common and an idiosyncratic component. The common component explains 80{\%} of bitcoin returns. The idiosyncratic components help explain arbitrage spreads between exchanges.},

abstract = {Purpose: The purpose of this study was to investigate how financial literacy and investment experience impact cryptocurrency investment behavior and explore which factor is more influential in cryptocurrency investment. Design/methodology/approach: Using a sample of US individual investors from the 2018 National Financial Capability Study Investor Survey, a three-step hierarchical logistic regression was conducted following a model-comparison approach. In addition, a mediation analysis was conducted using the Karlson−Holm−Breen (KHB) method to further explore the mediating effect of investment experience between financial literacy and cryptocurrency investment. Findings: This study found that while both financial literacy and investment experience were positively associated with investing in cryptocurrencies, investment experience was more influential in cryptocurrency investment. The findings also demonstrated that investment experience, especially risky asset holding, had a significant mediating effect between subjective financial knowledge and cryptocurrency investment behavior. Practical implications: The findings of this study offer insight to researchers by providing a deeper understanding of the determinants of cryptocurrency investment in the United States. This study also provides detailed implications for financial institutions, financial professionals and policymakers to guide rational cryptocurrency investment behavior. Originality/value: This study is one of the initial attempts to explore the determinant factors in cryptocurrency investment, an area that has rarely been studied in the literature.},

Recent events on the most popular of the digital currencies – BitCoin – have risen crucial questions about behavior of its exchange rates and they offer a field to study dynamics of the market which consists practically only of speculative traders with no fundamentalists as there is no fundamental value to the currency. In the paper, we connect two phenomena of the latest years – digital currencies, namely BitCoin and search queries on Google Trends and Wikipedia – and study their relationship. We show that not only are the search queries and the prices connected but there also exists a pronounced asymmetry between the effect of an increased interest in the currency while being above or below its trend value.},

abstract = {Mining is a central operation of all proof-of-work (PoW) based cryptocurrencies. The vast majority of miners today participate in "mining pools" instead of "solo mining" in order to lower risk and achieve a more steady income. However, this rise of participation in mining pools negatively affects the decentralization levels of most cryptocurrencies. In this work, we look into mining pools from the point of view of a miner: We present an analytical model and implement a computational tool that allows miners to optimally distribute their computational power over multiple pools and PoW cryptocurrencies (i.e. build a mining portfolio), taking into account their risk aversion levels. Our tool allows miners to maximize their risk-adjusted earnings by diversifying across multiple mining pools which enhances PoW decentralization. Finally, we run an experiment in Bitcoin historical data and demonstrate that a miner diversifying over multiple pools, as instructed by our model/tool, receives a higher overall Sharpe ratio (i.e. average excess reward over its standard deviation/volatility).},

Indeed, the research conducted by Alexander and Dakos (2020) is the only one that has focused on the properties and differences of several data sources, underlining inconsistencies in the time series of prices. In our paper, we contribute to this strand of the literature by examining one of the main features of digital currencies: the cryptocurrency market never sleeps. Given that cryptocurrencies trade on a 24/7 basis, specialised crypto companies offer two kinds of prices (close and weighted prices) to proxy Bitcoin daily prices. However, scholars and practitioners have not considered this issue in their analyses. We show that these prices are statistically different, which affects the financial decisions of investors and the most relevant fields in the cryptocurrency market (efficiency, risk management and volatility forecasting). Therefore, our paper demonstrates that the data processing used by specialised crypto firms is a relevant issue that changes the underlying mechanism of Bitcoin data, affecting the results of investors and scholars.},

We apply time-series analytical mechanisms to daily data of 17 virtual currencies (BitCoin + 16 alternative virtual currencies) and two altcoin price indices for the period 2013–2016. Our empirical findings confirm that indeed BitCoin and altcoin markets are interdependent. The BitCoin-altcoin price relationship is significantly stronger in the short-run than in the long-run. We cannot fully confirm the hypothesis that the BitCoin price relationship is stronger with those altcoins that are more similar in their price formation mechanism to BitCoin. In the long-run, macro-financial indicators determine the altcoin price formation to a slightly greater degree than BitCoin does. The virtual currency supply is exogenous and therefore plays only a limited role in the price formation.},

Significant dynamic linkages (interdependence) between the three cryptocurrencies under investigation are found in most cases when cyber-attacks are taken into account, Bitcoin appearing to be the dominant cryptocurrency. Further, Wald tests for parameter shifts during episodes of turbulence resulting from cyber-attacks provide evidence that the latter affect the transmission mechanism between cryptocurrency returns and volatilities (contagion). More precisely, cyber-attacks appear to strengthen cross-market linkages, thereby reducing portfolio diversification opportunities for cryptocurrency investors. Finally, the conditional correlation analysis confirms the previous findings.},

abstract = {Purpose: Decentralized finance (DeFi), enabled by blockchain, could bring about a new financial system, where peers will interact directly, with little or no place for traditional intermediation. However, some crucial tasks cannot be left solely to an algorithm and, consequently, most DeFi applications still require human decisions. The aim of this research is to assess the role of intermediation in the light of DeFi, analysing how humans and algorithms will interact. Design/methodology/approach: The authors based their work on a twofold qualitative methodology, first analysing publicly available secondary data, particularly from white papers and DeFi Pulse (a website providing data on DeFi solutions) and then running two focus group discussions. Findings: DeFi does not eliminate financial intermediation, but enables it to be performed in new ways, where decentralization means that no single entity can hold too much power or monopoly. DeFi has, however, inherited risks from the underlying technologies that unintentionally facilitate illegal behaviour and can hamper the authorities' supervision. The complex duality algorithm- vs human-based actions will not be solved indisputably in favour of the former, as DeFi solutions can range from requiring algorithms to play a dominant role, to enabling greater human interaction by actively involving more people. Originality/value: This research contributes to the emerging debate between algorithm- and human-based intermediation, especially in relation to the standing literature on financial intermediation, where considerations made in the light of the newest theories on blockchain and DeFi are still scarce.},

We also study the economic relevance of optimal liquidation strategies by calibrating a recent and realistic microstructure model with data from the Paris Stock Exchange. We distinguish between two cases: one in which the parameters are constant throughout the day and one in which they vary over time. We present and solve an optimization problem incorporating this realistic microstructure model. Our model endogenizes the trading periods required before a position is liquidated. A comparative static exercise demonstrates the realism of our model. We also examine the model for bearish and bullish beliefs, demonstrating that volatility plays a role in determining the speed of trade execution.},

Design/methodology/approach: The methodological approach involves using the requirements embedded in records management and digital preservation standards, specifically ISO 15,489, ARMA's Generally Accepted Recordkeeping Principles, ISO 14,721 and ISO 16,363, as a general evaluative framework for a risk-based assessment of a specific proposed implementation of Blockchain technology for a land registry system in a developing country. Findings: The results of the analysis suggest that Blockchain technology can be used to address issues associated with information integrity in the present and near term, assuming proper security architecture and infrastructure management controls. It does not, however, guarantee reliability of information in the first place, and would have several limitations as a long-term solution for maintaining trustworthy digital records.

abstract = {Literature suggests assets become more correlated during economic downturns. The COVID-19 crisis provides an unprecedented opportunity to investigate this considerably further. Further, whether cryptocurrencies provide a diversification for equities is still an unsettled issue. We employ several econometric procedures, including wavelet coherence, and neural network analyses to rigorously examine the role of COVID-19 on the paired co-movements of four cryptocurrencies, with seven equity indices (matching countries particularly impacted by COVID-19). Our period of study includes one year prior to the onset of COVID-19, and one year during the pandemic, extending deeper into the pandemic period (February 2021) than most previous studies. We find co-movements between cryptocurrencies and equity indices gradually increased as COVID-19 progressed. However, most of these co-movements are either modestly positively correlated, or minimal, suggesting cryptocurrencies in general do not provide a diversification benefit during either normal times or downturns. An exception, however, is the co-movement of tether. Tether co-moves negatively with equities to an economically significant degree, both pre COVID-19, and considerably more during COVID-19. Co-movements between tether and equity indices spiked sharply during identified waves of the pandemic. Tether appears to be an important safe haven during times of market turmoil, consistent with investors seeking USD liquidity during periods of volatility.},

Blockchain-based technologies have the potential to play a key role in this transition by offering decentralised interfaces and systems as well as an alternative approach to the current organisation form of the energy market. This paper discusses the applicability and prospects for blockchain-based technologies in the energy sector, which are described using the term "blockchain energy". For the purposes of this study, blockchain energy encompasses all socio-technical and organisational configurations in the energy sector based on the utilisation of the blockchain principle for energy trading, information storage, and/or increased transparency of energy flows and energy services. In the following chapters, the authors present and discuss the current transformation in the electricity market, followed by a review of the different utilisation possibilities for blockchain technologies in the energy sector and a discussion of the barriers and potential for blockchain energy using a transition studies perspective. Finally, the opportunities and risks of blockchain energy are discussed.},

The sensitivity of capital expenditures to investment opportunities, representing the efficiency of capital allocation decisions, improves when firms undertake spin-offs. The improvement in the efficiency of capital allocation decisions is most pronounced immediately following the completion of spin-offs (though it attenuates thereafter) and in companies that operate in a moderate (as opposed to a high or a low) number of businesses pre-spin-off. Together, these findings uncover a novel benefit that is associated with spin-offs, an improvement in the process by which managers allocate capital in the divesting firms. These results also suggest that an important theoretical mechanism that may be driving this improvement is that spin-offs enable managers to devote more attention to the capital allocation process within their remaining businesses.},

abstract = {DeFi risks and the decentralisation illusion 1 Decentralised finance (DeFi) is touted as a new form of intermediation in crypto markets. The key elements of this ecosystem are novel automated protocols on blockchains-to support trading, lending and investment of cryptoassets-and stablecoins that facilitate fund transfers. There is a "decentralisation illusion" in DeFi since the need for governance makes some level of centralisation inevitable and structural aspects of the system lead to a concentration of power. If DeFi were to become widespread, its vulnerabilities might undermine financial stability. These can be severe because of high leverage, liquidity mismatches, built-in interconnectedness and the lack of shock absorbers such as banks. Existing governance mechanisms in DeFi would provide natural reference points for authorities in addressing issues related to financial stability, investor protection and illicit activities. Crypto markets are underpinned by various forms of intermediation. While some forms of crypto intermediation have direct analogues in traditional finance, others-known as decentralised finance, or "DeFi"-are fundamentally new and have recently gained more traction. DeFi provides financial services without centralised intermediaries, by operating through automated protocols on blockchains. The DeFi ecosystem revolves around two elements: (i) novel protocols for trading, lending and investing, and (ii) stablecoins, which are cryptoassets that facilitate fund transfers and aim to maintain a fixed face value vis-{\`{a}}-vis fiat currencies, mainly the US dollar. While the main vision of DeFi's proponents is intermediation without centralised entities, we argue that some form of centralisation is inevitable. As such, there is a "decentralisation illusion". First and foremost, centralised governance is needed to take strategic and operational decisions. In addition, some features in DeFi, notably the consensus mechanism, favour a concentration of power. In principle, DeFi has the potential to complement traditional financial activities. At present, however, it has few real-economy uses and, for the most part, supports speculation and arbitrage across multiple cryptoassets. Given this self-contained nature, the potential for DeFi-driven disruptions in the broader financial system and the real economy seems limited for now.},

abstract = {In this paper, we add a new dimension to the cryptocurrency literature by examining the relationship between Bitcoin's energy consumption and miner's revenue. By resorting to quantile and Markov regime switching regression, we report a negative association between these variables. Further, the negative impact is strongly significant when the miner's revenues are low and volatile. Thus, the higher energy consumption in the wake of escalating global energy costs amid bearish market sentiments impedes the miners to break-even. Hence, it would not be viable to sustain the business unless cheap energy sources and efficient mining hardware are relied upon.},

abstract = {At present times, Blockchain technology is gaining more attraction with every passing day, as it has revolutionized the traditional trade due to its distributed ledger feature, every record in this ledger is secured by rules of cryptography which makes it more secure and tamper-free. This naturally led to the emergence of various types of cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, which builds on a technology commonly known as Blockchain. The rapid evolution of research on Blockchain calls for more research studies for investigating and analyzing the current knowledge in this field through a systematic technical study that shows the impact and significance of the related literature since the inception of the technology in 2013. From this point, in this paper, a state-of-the-art review is conducted on the most influential articles, conference papers, and review papers related to Blockchain published from 2013 to 2020 and indexed by the Web of Science Core CollectionTM (WoS) world's literature database. To attain the desired objective, after presenting an inevitable, brief overview of Blockchain technology, the collected papers have closely been analyzed along seven key research questions. Subsequently, vital valuable findings, such as the top 10 influential papers, yearly publications and citation trends, the favorite publication venues, the hottest research areas, and the most supportive funding bodies are reported, which may offer several implications about the status quo and emerging trends and frontiers of Blockchain, to guide towards establishing a baseline for both fresh and experienced researchers and practitioners before initiating a future research project on Blockchain. Furthermore, a rigorous discussion is provided on Blockchain application in diversified domains, along with different versatile use cases. Lastly, a brief insight is presented into open challenges and potential future advancements in the field of Blockchain. Summing up, this paper is meant to assist newbies in exploring and designing new Blockchain solutions, bearing in mind existing demands and challenges.},

abstract = {While the impact of divestitures on parent firms has been extensively studied, little attention has been given to the performance of the divested units. Previous research has found that spin‐offs and sell‐offs were associated with significant positive cumulative abnormal returns. However, these studies have not identified whether these benefits were expected to accrue to the divesting firm, the divested unit, or both. Specifically, this study examined the performance as autonomous firms of a sample of 51 voluntary spin‐offs by nonfinancial firms across a 6‐year period. Three accounting and financial market measures were tracked from 2 years prior to divestiture through the first three years of independence. No change in pre‐ and post‐spin‐off performances was observed except for the decline in profitability return on assets (ROA). The effect of relatedness between the parent company and the spinoff was also examined. Divested units which were unrelated to their parents prior to spinoff reported deterioration in performance. Implications for divestiture and restructuring programs are developed. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1992 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

The similar value in China relative to the US occurs despite the extremely large disparity between the value of a statistical life estimate for the US relative to that of China. Further, with each cryptocurrency, the rising electricity requirements to produce a single coin can lead to an almost inevitable cliff of negative net social benefits, absent perpetual price increases. For example, in December 2018, our results illustrate a case (for Bitcoin) where the health and climate change “cryptodamages” roughly match each {\$}1 of coin value created.

Five GARCH models, with different error distributions, are fitted to each of these crypto-currencies. The most effectively fit model or superior set of models is then selected through maximizing the likelihood and minimizing the AIC and BIC information criteria. The reached results prove that the majority of crypto-currencies turn out to be rather effectively modulated via the TGARCH with double exponential distribution. Indeed, the attained findings report an asymmetric effect whereby volatility turns out to increase rather by response to positive shocks than by response to negative shocks, implying an asymmetric effect that differs from that generally observed in stock markets. The increase in volatility, as emanating in response to positive shocks may well have its justification in the uninformed investors' undertaken herding strategies.},

abstract = {Bitcoin is a well-established blockchain-based cryptocurrency that has attracted a great deal of attention from media and regulators alike. While millions of individuals invest in bitcoin, their motivations for doing so are less clear than with traditional investment decisions. We argue that the technical nature of bitcoin investments gives it unique characteristics and, consequently, that we lack a thorough understanding of how this affects the motivations behind bitcoin investment. We use a mixed method approach consisting of qualitative (n = 73) and quantitative (n = 150) studies and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to identify seven bitcoin-specific motivations (profit expectancy, ease of bitcoin acquisition, support of bitcoin ideology, investment skills, risk affinity, anticipated and experienced inaction regret) and how configurations of them explain bitcoin investment. The findings reveal, among others, that some individuals invest in bitcoin because they support the bitcoin ideology. Contrary to the traditional investment literature, profit expectancy is not a necessary condition to the extent that there is one empirical configuration of motivations that explains that individuals also invest in bitcoin even if they do not expect profits. The results disclose non-trivial investment motivation configurations and lay the groundwork for future studies of the role of cryptocurrencies in society.},

abstract = {Consensus is a fundamental problem of distributed computing. While this problem has been known to be unsolvable since 1985, existing protocols were designed these past three decades to solve consensus under various assumptions. Today, with the recent advent of blockchains, various consensus implementations were proposed to make replicas reach an agreement on the order of transactions updating what is often referred to as a distributed ledger. Very little work has however been devoted to explore its theoretical ramifications. As a result existing proposals are sometimes misunderstood and it is often unclear whether the problems arising during their executions are due to implementation bugs or more fundamental design issues. In this paper, we discuss the mainstream blockchain consensus algorithms and how the classic Byzantine consensus can be revisited for the blockchain context. In particular, we discuss proof-of-work consensus and illustrate the differences between the Bitcoin and the Ethereum proof-of-work consensus algorithms. Based on these definitions, we warn about the dangers of using these blockchains without understanding precisely the guarantees their consensus algorithm offers. In particular, we survey attacks against the Bitcoin and the Ethereum consensus algorithms. We finally discuss the advantage of the recent Blockchain Byzantine consensus definition over previous definitions, and the promises offered by emerging consistent blockchains.},

In this work, we estimate the potential profitability of mining and speculating 18 altcoins using real-world blockchain and trade data. Using opportunity cost as a metric, we estimate the mining cost for an altcoin with respect to a more popular but stable coin. For every dollar invested in mining or buying a coin, we compute the potential returns under various conditions, such as time of market entry and hold positions. While some coins offer the potential for spectacular returns, many follow a simple bubble-and-crash scenario, which highlights the extreme risks—and potential gains—in altcoin markets.},

Crypto-Index 20 comprises a stronger positive correlation and is exposed to higher volatility than six selected European equity indexes.,This research provides practical implications for the investors on the diversification benefits and risks attached to the cryptocurrencies portfolio by comparing it with the traditional equity portfolios. From a policy perspective, regulators might obtain information on the risk properties involved into cryptocurrencies and the possibility of creating an optimal portfolio.},

abstract = {In the evolving and ever-changing world of cryptocurrency, new and exciting phenomena arise, including hard forks. Hard forks occur when two groups supporting a cryptocurrency disagree on how the code should evolve. If the changes are incompatible, the code diverges into two chains, essentially doubling the amount of each holder's coin. Forking a coin is theoretically easy. However, maintaining a fork requires great effort and support by members of the community. This Article discusses the November 15, 2018 Bitcoin Cash hard fork and subsequent lawsuit, analyzing anti-trust, negligence, and conversion claims. Forcing de facto fiduciary duties on developers and miners fails to consider that cryptocurrency is a product, likening developers to copyright holders, and the basic premises of fiduciary law. Next, this Article examines the effect of lawsuits on crypto-communities, including legal and economic ramifications of hard forks. While developers may hold some power in cryptocurrency management, external regulations would be impractical and lead to serious ramifications. This Article proposes that developers and miners should protect themselves through contract law and public blockchain networks should be treated as pseudo-sovereigns with internal regulations, for situations such as hard forks.

abstract = {The relationship between co-integration and error correction models, first suggested in Granger (1981), is here extended and used to develop estimation procedures, tests, and empirical examples. If each element of a vector of time series x, first achieves stationarity after differencing, but a linear combination a′xt is already stationary, the time series x, are said to be co-integrated with co-integrating vector a. There may be several such co-integrating vectors so that a becomes a matrix. Interpreting a′xt = 0 as a long run equilibrium, co-integration implies that deviations from equilibrium are stationary, with finite variance, even though the series themselves are nonstationary and have infinite variance. The paper presents a representation theorem based on Granger (1983), which connects the moving average, autoregressive, and error correction representations for co-integrated systems. A vector autoregression in differenced variables is incompatible with these representations. Estimation of these models is discussed and a simple but asymptotically efficient two-step estimator is proposed. Testing for co-integration combines the problems of unit root tests and tests with parameters unidentified under the null. Seven statistics are formulated and analyzed. The critical values of these statistics are calculated based on a Monte Carlo simulation. Using these critical values, the power properties of the tests are examined and one test procedure is recommended for application. In a veries of examples it is found that consumption and income are co-integrated, wages and prices are not, short and long interest rates are, and nominal GNP is co-integrated with M2, but not Ml, M3, or aggregate liquid assets.},

We show that an exchange rate policy, which is less than 100{\%} backed and dynamically adjusts in response to traders' conversion demand eliminates speculative attacks while, under some conditions, preserving much of the desired exchange rate stability. This dynamic exchange rate policy admits a great deal of discretion to and requires commitment by the party implementing the policy. We demonstrate how to implement this policy using the Ethereum network—a smart contract blockchain environment—and how this implementation yields commitment to the policy.},

Liquidity can be generally described as the ability to trade large quantities of financial assets quickly at low cost with less price impact.

More uninformed trading allows market makers to reduce their inventory holding costs and adverse information cost, leading to lower trading costs and liquidity improvement. Using a GAM model, we find that stock splits positively affect stock liquidity between 1996 and 2013 in China.},

abstract = {DeFi ('decentralized finance') has joined FinTech ('financial technology'), RegTech ('reg-ulatory technology'), cryptocurrencies, and digital assets as one of the most discussed emerging technological evolutions in global finance. Yet little is really understood about its meaning, legal implications, and policy consequences. In this article we introduce DeFi, put DeFi in the context of the traditional financial economy, connect DeFi to open banking, and end with some policy considerations. We suggest that decentralization has the potential to undermine traditional forms of accountability and erode the effectiveness of traditional financial regulation and enforcement. At the same time, we find that where parts of the financial services value chain are decentralized, there will be a reconcentration in a different (but possibly less regulated, less visible, and less transparent) part of the value chain. DeFi regulation could, and should, focus on this reconcentrated portion of the value chain to ensure effective oversight and risk control. Rather than eliminating the need for regulation, in fact DeFi requires regulation in order to achieve its core objective of decentralization. Furthermore, DeFi potentially offers an opportunity for the development of an entirely new way to design regulation: the idea of 'embedded regulation'. Regulatory approaches could be built into the design of DeFi, thus potentially decentralizing both finance and its regulation, in the ultimate expression of RegTech.},

NFTs are tradeable rights to digital assets (images, music, videos, virtual creations) where ownership is recorded in smart contracts on a blockchain. Given the NFT market emerged out of cryptocurrencies, we explore if NFT pricing is related to cryptocurrency pricing. A spillover index shows only limited volatility transmission effects between cryptocurrencies and NFTs. But wavelet coherence analysis indicates co-movement between the two sets of markets. This suggests that cryptocurrency pricing behaviours might be of some benefit in understanding NFT pricing patterns. However, the low volatility transmissions also indicate that NFTs can potentially be considered as a low-correlation asset class distinct from cryptocurrencies.},

abstract = {Cryptocurrencies have recently captured the interest of the econometric literature, with several works trying to address the existence of bubbles in the price dynamics of Bitcoins and other cryptoassets. Extremely rapid price accelerations, often referred to as explosive behaviors, followed by drastic drops pose high risks to investors. From a risk management perspective, testing the explosiveness of individual cryptocurrency time series is not the only crucial issue. Investigating co-explosivity in the cryptoassets, i.e., whether explosivity in one cryptocurrency leads to explosivity in other cryptocurrencies, allows indeed to take into account possible shock propagation channels and improve the prediction of market collapses. To this aim, our paper investigates the relationships between the explosive behaviors of cryptocurrencies through a unit root testing approach.},

abstract = {We investigate the informational role of volume and its applicability for technical analysis. We develop a new equilibrium model in which aggregate supply is fixed and traders receive signals with differing quality. We show that volume provides information on information quality that cannot be deduced from the price statistic. We show how volume, information precision, and price movements relate, and demonstrate how sequences of volume and prices can be informative. We also show that traders who use information contained in market statistics do better than traders who do not. Technical analysis thus arises as a natural component of the agents' learning process.},

abstract = {The Bitcoin mining protocol has been intensively studied and widely adopted by many other cryptocurrencies. However, it has been shown that this protocol is not incentive compatible, because the selfish mining strategy enables a miner to gain unfair rewards. Existing defenses either demand fundamental changes to block validity rules or have little effect against a resourceful attacker. This paper proposes a backward-compatible defense mechanism which outperforms the previous best defense. Our fork-resolving policy neglects blocks that are not published in time and appreciates blocks that incorporate links to competing blocks of their predecessors. Consequently, a block that is kept secret until a competing block is published contributes to neither or both branches, hence it confers no advantage in winning the block race. Additionally, we discuss the dilemma between partition recovery time and selfish mining resistance, and how to balance them in our defense.},
