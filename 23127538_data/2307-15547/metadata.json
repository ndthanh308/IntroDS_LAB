  "abstract": "Recently, the pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations have reported the evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) at nano-Hertz band. The spectrum of inflationary gravitational wave (IGW) is unknown, which might exhibit different power law at different frequency-bands, thus if the PTA signal is primordial, it will be significant to explore the underlying implications of current PTA and CMB data on IGW. In this paper, we perform a joint Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis for a broken power-law spectrum of IGW with the NANOGrav 15-year and BICEP/Keck 2018 data. It is found that though the bestfit spectral tilt of IGW at PTA band is $n^\\text{PTA}_\\text{T} =2.42^{+0.32}_{-0.91}$, at CMB band the bestfit is $n^\\text{CMB}_\\text{T} =0.55^{+0.37}_{-0.10}$ while a detectable amplitude of $r$ with $n^\\text{CMB}_\\text{T} \\simeq 0$ is still compatible. The implication of our results for inflation is also discussed.",
