  "abstract": "In this article, we investigate symmetric 2-designs of prime order admitting a flag-transitive automorphism group G. Recently, the authors proved that the automorphism group G of this type of designs must be point-primitive, and is of affine or almost simple type. Here, we give the complete classification of symmetric 2-designs of prime order, admitting a flag-transitive almost simple automorphism group.",
