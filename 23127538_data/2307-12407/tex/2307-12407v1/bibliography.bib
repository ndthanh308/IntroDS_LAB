	abstract = {Shape optimization is of great significance in structural engineering, as an efficient geometry leads to better performance of structures. However, the application of gradient-based shape optimization for form finding is limited, which is partly due to the difficulty and the complexity in gradient evaluation. In this work, an efficient framework based on automatic differentiation (AD), the adjoint method and accelerated linear algebra (XLA) is proposed to promote the implementation of gradient-based shape optimization for form finding. The framework is realized by the implementation of the high-performance computing (HPC) library JAX. We leverage AD and the adjoint method in the sensitivity analysis stage. The XLA feature is exploited by an efficient programming architecture that we proposed, which can boost gradient evaluation via just-in-time compilation of computer programs. The proposed framework also supports hardware acceleration such as GPUs. The framework is applied to the form finding of arches and different free-form gridshells: gridshell inspired by Mannheim Multihalle, four-point supported gridshell, and canopy-like structures. Two geometric descriptive methods are used: non-parametric and parametric description via Bézier surface. Unconstrained and constrained shape optimization problems are considered, where the former is solved by gradient descent and the latter is solved by sequential quadratic programming (SQP). Through these examples, the proposed framework is shown to be able to provide structural engineers with an efficient tool for form finding, enabling better design for the built environment.},

	abstract = {The initial geometry of structures made of cables is steered by the cable tensioning forces. In a cable net the geometrical shape and the internal force distribution cannot be dealt as separate issues: the set of geometries defines also the feasible sets of the internal forces. During the last decades, many different approaches have been proposed to deal with the form finding of cable structures. The most efficient one is the so called Force Density Method (FDM), proposed by Schek, which allows to conforming cable nets for structural applications without requiring any further assumption, neither on the geometry, nor on the material properties. An Extension of the Force Density Method, the EFDM, makes it possible to set conditions in terms of fixed nodal reactions or, in other words, to fix the position of a certain number of nodes and, at the same time, to impose the intensity of the reaction forces. Through such an extension the EFDM enables us to deal with form finding problems of cable nets subjected to given constraints and in particular to treat mixed structures, made of cables and struts. In this paper we consider cable nets interacting with members having flexural behaviour. For a given cable assembly and for a given loading condition, aim of this work is to find that particular pretensioning system which replaces both the static and the kinematic functions of the inner reactions of a flexural elastic continuous beam. It is, for instance, the case of the bridge decks suspended by cables, shaped in various forms. The specialization of the EFDM to this type of problem is presented and a progressive set of examples shows the efficiency and the versatility of this approach in contributing to the design of new creative forms.},

	abstract = {This paper proposes a computational approach to form-find pin-jointed bar structures subjected to combinations of tension and compression forces. The generated equilibrium states can meet structural and geometrical constraints via gradient-based optimization. We achieve this by extending the combinatorial equilibrium modeling (CEM) framework in three important ways. First, we introduce a new topological object, the auxiliary trail, to expand the range of structures that can be form-found with the framework. Then, we leverage automatic differentiation (AD) to obtain an exact value of the gradient of the sequential and iterative calculations of the CEM form-finding algorithm, instead of a numerical approximation. Finally, we encapsulate our research developments in an open-source design tool written in Python that is usable across different CAD platforms and operating systems. After studying four different structures – a self-stressed tensegrity, a tree canopy, a curved bridge, and a spiral staircase – we demonstrate that our approach enables the solution of constrained form-finding problems on a diverse range of structures more efficiently than in previous work.},

	abstract = {We introduce Adam, an algorithm for first-order gradient-based optimization of stochastic objective functions, based on adaptive estimates of lower-order moments. The method is straightforward to implement, is computationally efficient, has little memory requirements, is invariant to diagonal rescaling of the gradients, and is well suited for problems that are large in terms of data and/or parameters. The method is also appropriate for non-stationary objectives and problems with very noisy and/or sparse gradients. The hyper-parameters have intuitive interpretations and typically require little tuning. Some connections to related algorithms, on which Adam was inspired, are discussed. We also analyze the theoretical convergence properties of the algorithm and provide a regret bound on the convergence rate that is comparable to the best known results under the online convex optimization framework. Empirical results demonstrate that Adam works well in practice and compares favorably to other stochastic optimization methods. Finally, we discuss AdaMax, a variant of Adam based on the infinity norm.},

	abstract = {The structural design process for buildings is time-consuming and laborious. To automate this process, structural engineers combine optimization methods with simulation tools to find an optimal design with minimal building mass subject to building regulations. However, structural engineers in practice often avoid optimization and compromise on a suboptimal design for the majority of buildings, due to the large size of the design space, the iterative nature of the optimization methods, and the slow simulation tools. In this work, we formulate the building structures as graphs and create an end-to-end pipeline that can learn to propose the optimal cross-sections of columns and beams by training together with a pre-trained differentiable structural simulator. The performance of the proposed structural designs is comparable to the ones optimized by genetic algorithm (GA), with all the constraints satisfied. The optimal structural design with the reduced the building mass can not only lower the material cost, but also decrease the carbon footprint.},

The force densities of each tensegrity are obtained by the minimisation of a particular objective function, leading to a semi-positive definite force density matrix (a super-stable tensegrity) with a required rank deficiency. A genetic algorithm is used as a global search technique for the minimisation. The geometry of a tensegrity is subsequently formed based on those eigenvectors of the force density matrix corresponding to zero eigenvalues. Furthermore, two other methods are introduced to convert the asymmetrical geometry obtained from the main algorithm into its symmetrical counterparts. This transformation in geometry is performed by finding a suitable linear combination of the mentioned eigenvectors. Examples from well-known tensegrities including prismatic, truncated tetrahedron, expandable octahedron and truncated icosahedron tensegrities are studied using the present method, and the results obtained are compared with those documented in the literature to verify the efficiency of the present method.},

This concept is based upon the force-length ratios or force densities which are defined for each branch of the net structure. It is shown that the force densities are very suitable parameters for the description of the equilibrium state of any general network: the associated node coordinates of the structure are obtained by solving one single system of linear equations. A Gaussian transformation of the topological branch-node matrix yields the equation matrix. A method based on force densities renders a simple linear “analytical form finding” possible. If the free choice of the force densities is restricted by further conditions, the linear method is extended to a nonlinear one. A damped least squares approach is then introduced. In this version the method may be applied to the detailed computation of networks. Moreover, an interesting cross-connection between geometrical minimum way nets and prestressed unloaded structures is derived using the force densities.},

significant share, slabs are usually designed as monolithic, oversized boxes due to various construction constraints. Optimised design alternatives, featuring funicular shapes, differentiated ribs, profiled soffits and hollow sections use significantly less material and can moreover integrate
building services within the thickness of the slab, such as heating, cooling and ventilation. Nevertheless, both the optimised external geometry and the internal network of functional voids present very complex fabrication challenges for concrete. This is because standard commercial formwork
systems are not suitable for bespoke designs. To address this limitation, this research demonstrates how fused-deposition 3D printing can be used for the fabrication of custom formwork for a functionally integrated concrete slab. The resulting prototype efficiently uses material and integrates
provisions for an active beam ventilation system within the standard structural depth of the slab (Fig. 1). All these intricate geometric features are achieved with an ultra-lightweight 3D-printed formwork, which weighs less than 15 kg for the 660 kg concrete slab.},

Traditional direct form-finding allows the designer to generate shapes for structures that need to verify a mechanical equilibrium when built; however, it produces shapes that are difficult to control. This dissertation shows how the design of constrained structural systems is better solved by an inverse formfinding process, where the parameters and initial conditions of the direct form-finding process are automatically adjusted to match the design intent. By defining a general framework for the implementation of such workflows in a nested optimizer loop, the requirements on each component are articulated. The inner optimizer is a specially selected direct form-finding solver, the outer optimizer is a general-purpose optimization routine. This is demonstrated with case studies of two structural systems: bending-active structures and funicular structures. These two systems that can lead to efficient covering structures of long spans.},

	abstract = {Damaged eggshells result in losses of eggs. Numerous efforts have been carried out to improve eggshell quality, which may lead to increased eggshell thickness. The conventional way of enhancing eggshell strength with thicker eggshell on average may be replaced by a new strategy to improve eggshell uniformity without increasing eggshell thickness. To achieve this, it is necessary to investigate global variation of eggshell thickness. In this study, we used 100 fresh eggs from 52-wk-old layers of a commercial brown-egg variety. To determine the global variation of eggshell thickness, 42 points for each egg along both longitudinal and latitudinal axes were selected to measure thickness using an eggshell thickness gauge. The eggshell thickness from blunt to sharp end varied significantly (P {\textless} 0.05). The area surrounding the blunt end was the thinnest (0.341 ± 0.025 mm), whereas the area surrounding the sharp end was the thickest (0.367 ± 0.023 mm). It was found that the thickness of the sharp end was the closest to the average thickness of the whole eggshell and could be considered as a valid measurement of eggshell thickness. A new parameter, eggshell thickness uniformity, was defined as the reciprocal of the coefficient of variation (1/CV) of eggshell thickness from 42 points of each egg and can be used to evaluate the eggshell quality. Eggshell thickness uniformity was positively correlated with breaking strength (r = 0.341; P {\textless} 0.01), suggesting that the parameter may be used as a potential selection criterion in breeding program to improve eggshell quality without increasing eggshell thickness.},
