\section{Conclusion}

We presented JAX FDM, an open-source solver that streamlines the design of 3D structures in static equilibrium conditioned on target properties.
Future work will include our solver as a differentiable layer in neural networks to build accurate surrogate models that further accelerate inverse form-finding.
