	abstract = {We outline a method of deriving boost invariant hamiltonians for effective particles in quantum field theory. The hamiltonians are defined and calculated using creation and annihilation operators in light-front dynamics. The renormalization group equations are written for a sequence of unitary transformations which gradually transform the bare canonical creation and annihilation operators of a local theory to the creation and annihilation operators of effective particles in an effective theory with the same dynamical content but a finite range of energy transfers due to form factors in the interaction vertices. The boost invariant effective hamiltonians can be used to describe the constituent dynamics in relativistically moving systems including the rest and the infinite momentum frame. The general equations are illustrated in perturbation theory by second-order calculations of self-energy and two-particle interaction terms in Yukawa theory, QED and QCD. In Yukawa theory, one obtains the generalized Yukawa potential including its full off-energy-shell extension and form factors in the vertices. In QED, the effective hamiltonian eigenvalue problem converges for small coupling constants to the Schrödinger equation but the typical relativistic ultraviolet singularities at short distances between constituents are regularized by the similarity form factors. In the second-order QCD effective hamiltonian one obtains a boost invariant logarithmically confining quark-anti-quark interaction term which may remain uncanceled in the non-abelian dynamics of effective quarks and gluons.},

	abstract = {We investigate the spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry in QCD by means of a recently proposed approximation scheme in the Landau-gauge Curci-Ferrari model, which combines an expansion in the Yang-Mills coupling and in the inverse number of colors, without expanding in the quark-gluon coupling. The expansion allows for a consistent treatment of ultraviolet tails via renormalization group techniques. At leading order, it leads to the resummation of rainbow diagrams for the quark propagator, with, however, a trivial running of both the gluon mass and the quark-gluon coupling. In a previous work, by using a simple model for a more realistic running of these parameters, we could reproduce the known phenomenology of chiral symmetry breaking, including a satisfactory description of the lattice data for the quark mass function. Here, we get rid of this model-dependence by taking our approximation scheme to next-to-leading order. This allows us to consistently include the realistic running of the parameters and to access the unquenched gluon and ghost propagators to first nontrivial order, which we can compare to available lattice data for an even more stringent test of our approach. In particular, our results for the various two-point functions compare well with lattice data while the parameters of the model are strongly constrained.},

	abstract = {Lattice simulations of the QCD correlation functions in the Landau gauge have established two remarkable facts. First, the coupling constant in the gauge sector remains finite and moderate at all scales, suggesting that some kind of perturbative description should be valid down to infrared momenta. Second, the gluon propagator reaches a finite nonzero value at vanishing momentum, corresponding to a gluon screening mass. We review recent studies which aim at describing the long-distance properties of Landau gauge QCD by means of the perturbative Curci-Ferrari model. The latter is the simplest deformation of the Faddeev-Popov Lagrangian in the Landau gauge that includes a gluon screening mass at tree-level. There are, by now, strong evidences that this approach successfully describes many aspects of the infrared QCD dynamics. In particular, several correlation functions were computed at one- and two-loop orders and compared with \{{\textbackslash}it ab-initio\} lattice simulations. The typical error is of the order of ten percent for a one-loop calculation and drops to few percents at two loops. We review such calculations in the quenched approximation as well as in the presence of dynamical quarks. In the latter case, the spontaneous breaking of the chiral symmetry requires to go beyond a coupling expansion but can still be described in a controlled approximation scheme in terms of small parameters. We also review applications of the approach to nonzero temperature and chemical potential.},

	abstract = {In QCD, the Schwinger mechanism endows the gluons with an eﬀective mass through the dynamical formation of massless bound-state poles that are longitudinally coupled. The presence of these poles aﬀects profoundly the infrared properties of the interaction vertices, inducing crucial modiﬁcations to their fundamental Ward identities. Within this general framework, we present a detailed derivation of the non-Abelian Ward identity obeyed by the pole-free part of the threegluon vertex in the soft-gluon limit, and determine the smoking-gun displacement that the onset of the Schwinger mechanism produces to the standard result. Quite importantly, the quantity that describes this distinctive feature coincides formally with the bound-state wave function that controls the massless pole formation. Consequently, this signal may be computed in two independent ways: by solving an approximate version of the pertinent Bethe-Salpeter integral equation, or by appropriately combining the elements that enter in the aforementioned Ward identity. For the implementation of both methods we employ two- and three-point correlation functions obtained from recent lattice simulations, and a partial derivative of the ghost-gluon kernel, which is computed from the corresponding Schwinger-Dyson equation. Our analysis reveals an excellent coincidence between the results obtained through either method, providing a highly nontrivial self-consistency check for the entire approach. When compared to the null hypothesis, where the Schwinger mechanism is assumed to be inactive, the statistical signiﬁcance of the resulting signal is estimated to be three standard deviations.},

It has long been conjectured that this expresses the action of a Schwinger mechanism for gauge boson mass generation in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). For such to be true, it is necessary and suﬃcient that a dynamically-generated, massless, colour-carrying, scalar gluon+gluon correlation emerge as a feature of the dressed three-gluon vertex. Working with results on elementary Schwinger functions obtained via the numerical simulation of lattice-regularised QCD, we establish with an extremely high level of conﬁdence that just such a feature appears; hence, conﬁrm the conjectured origin of the gluon mass scale.},

In a previous work we have studied the dynamics of chiral symmetry breaking at the level of the quark propagator and, in particular, the dynamical generation of a constituent quark mass. In the present article, we study the associated Goldstone mode, the pion, and we compute the pion decay constant in the chiral limit. Our approach exploits the fact that the coupling (defined in the Taylor scheme) in the pure gauge sector is perturbative, as observed in lattice simulations which, together with a \$1/N\_c\$-expansion, allows for a systematic, controllable approximation scheme in the low energy regime of QCD. At leading order, this leads to the well-known rainbow-ladder resummation. We study the region of parameter space of the model that gives physical values of the pion decay constant. This allows one to constrain the gluon mass parameter as a function of the coupling using a physically measured quantity.},
