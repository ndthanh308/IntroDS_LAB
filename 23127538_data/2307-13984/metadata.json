  "abstract": "We construct a Lorentz invariant massive particle model in (2+1) space-time with an enlarged set of symmetries which includes Bondi-Metzner-Sachs (BMS) translations (supertranslations), using the non-linear realization framework. The Hamiltonian formalism for the resulting Lagrangian is constructed, and the infinite phase-space constraints and the set of gauge transformations are analysed. We also compute the massless limit of the theory in phase-space. After eliminating the gauge degrees of freedom, the physical reduced space is left only with the degrees of freedom of a standard Poincaré particle but with a residual set of symmetries that we prove to be BMS. A similar result for the massless limit, including in this case superrotations, is pointed out.",
