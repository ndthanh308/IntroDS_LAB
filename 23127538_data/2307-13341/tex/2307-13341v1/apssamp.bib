In this work, we investigate the interplay between heat current and entanglement in a two-qubit entanglement engine, deriving a critical heat current for successful operation of the engine, i.e. a cut-off above which entanglement is present. The heat current can thus be seen as a witness to the presence of entanglement. In the regime of weak-inter-qubit coupling, we also investigate the effect of two experimentally relevant parameters for the qubits, the energy detuning and tunnelling, on the entanglement production. Finally, we show that the regime of strong inter-qubit coupling provides no clear advantage over the weak regime, in the context of out-of-equilibrium entanglement engines.}

	journal = {Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment},
	abstract = {Several implications of well-known fluctuation theorems, on the statistical properties of entropy production, are studied using various approaches. We begin by deriving a tight lower bound on the variance of the entropy production for a given mean of this random variable. It is shown that the Evans–Searles fluctuation theorem alone imposes a significant lower bound on the variance only when the mean entropy production is very small. It is then nonetheless demonstrated that upon incorporating additional information concerning the entropy production, this lower bound can be significantly improved, so as to capture extensivity properties. Another important aspect of the fluctuation properties of the entropy production is the relationship between the mean and the variance, on the one hand, and the probability of the event where the entropy production is negative, on the other hand. Accordingly, we derive upper and lower bounds on this probability in terms of the mean and the variance. These bounds are tighter than previous bounds that can be found in the literature. Moreover, they are tight in the sense that there exist probability distributions, satisfying the Evans–Searles fluctuation theorem, that achieve them with equality. Finally, we present a general method for generating a wide class of inequalities that must be satisfied by the entropy production. We use this method to derive several new inequalities that go beyond the standard derivation of the second law.}

Although the total entropy of system plus reservoirs is conserved, we show that system entropy production is always positive and is a direct measure of system–reservoir correlations and/or entanglements. Using an exactly solvable quantum model, we illustrate our novel interpretation of the Second Law in a microscopically reversible finite-size setting, with strong coupling between the system and the reservoirs. With this model, we also explicitly show the approach of our exact formulation to the standard description of irreversibility in the limit of a large reservoir.}

	journal = {Europhysics Letters ({EPL})},
	abstract = {Thermodynamics teaches that if a system initially off-equilibrium is coupled to work sources, the maximum work that it may yield is governed by its energy and entropy. For finite systems this bound is usually not reachable. The maximum extractable work compatible with quantum mechanics (“ergotropy”) is derived and expressed in terms of the density matrix and the Hamiltonian. It is related to the property of majorization: more major states can provide more work. Scenarios of work extraction that contrast the thermodynamic intuition are discussed, e.g. a state with larger entropy than another may produce more work, while correlations may increase or reduce the ergotropy.}

    abstract = { When deriving a master equation for a multipartite weakly-interacting open quantum systems, dissipation is often addressed locally on each component, i.e. ignoring the coherent couplings, which are later added ‘by hand’. Although simple, the resulting local master equation (LME) is known to be thermodynamically inconsistent. Otherwise, one may always obtain a consistent global master equation (GME) by working on the energy basis of the full interacting Hamiltonian. Here, we consider a two-node ‘quantum wire’ connected to two heat baths. The stationary solution of the LME and GME are obtained and benchmarked against the exact result. Importantly, in our model, the validity of the GME is constrained by the underlying secular approximation. Whenever this breaks down (for resonant weakly-coupled nodes), we observe that the LME, in spite of being thermodynamically flawed: (a) predicts the correct steady state, (b) yields with the exact asymptotic heat currents, and (c) reliably reflects the correlations between the nodes. In contrast, the GME fails at all three tasks. Nonetheless, as the inter-node coupling grows, the LME breaks down whilst the GME becomes correct. Hence, the global and local approach may be viewed as complementary tools, best suited to different parameter regimes. }
