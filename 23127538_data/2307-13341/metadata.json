  "abstract": "We discuss exchange scenario's thermodynamic uncertainty relations for the work done on a two-qubit entangled nonequilibrium steady state obtained by coupling the two qubits and putting each of them in weak contact with a thermal bath. In this way we investigate the use of entangled nonequilibrium steady states as end-points of thermodynamic cycles. In this framework, we prove analytically that for a paradigmatic unitary it is possible to construct an exchange scenario's thermodynamic uncertainty relation. However, despite holding in many cases, we also show that such relation ceases to be valid when considering other suitable unitary quenches. Furthermore, this paradigmatic example allows us to shed light on the role of the entanglement between the two qubits for precise work absorption. By considering the projection of the entangled steady state onto the set of separable states, we provide examples where such projection implies an increase of the relative uncertainty, showing the usefulness of entanglement.",
