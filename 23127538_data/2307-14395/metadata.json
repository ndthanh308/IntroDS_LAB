  "abstract": "Recently, using neural networks to simulate spatio-temporal dynamics has received a lot of attention. However, most existing methods adopt pure data-driven black-box models, which have limited accuracy and interpretability. By combining trainable difference operators with black-box models, we propose a new hybrid architecture explicitly embedded with partial prior knowledge of the underlying PDEs named PDE-Net++. Furthermore, we introduce two distinct options called the trainable flipping difference layer (TFDL) and the trainable dynamic difference layer (TDDL) for the difference operators. Numerous numerical experiments have demonstrated that PDE-Net++ has superior prediction accuracy and better extrapolation performance than black-box models.",
