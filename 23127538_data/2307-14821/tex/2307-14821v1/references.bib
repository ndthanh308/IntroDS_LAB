First we correlate measurements of the production of secondary electrons at metallic cathodes, i.e. the yields of electrons induced by Ar+ ions, fast Ar atoms, metastable atoms and vuv photons. The yields of electrons per ion, fast atom and photon vary greatly with particle energy and surface condition. Then models of electron, ion, fast atom, excited atom and photon transport and kinetics are fitted to electrical-breakdown and low-current, discharge-maintenance data to determine the contributions of various cathode-directed species to the secondary electron production. Our model explains measured breakdown and low-current discharge voltages for Ar over a very wide range of electric field to gas density ratios E/n, i.e. 15 Td to 100 kTd. We review corrections for nonequilibrium electron motion near the cathode that apply to our local-field model of these discharges. Analytic expressions for the cross sections and reaction coefficients used by this and related models are summarized.}

Based on phase and space resolved measurements of the population dynamics of excited states several diagnostic techniques have been developed. Results for a hydrogen capacitively coupled RF (CCRF) discharge are discussed as an example. The gas temperature, the degree of dissociation and the temporally and spatially resolved electron energy distribution function (EEDF) of energetic electrons (>12eV) are measured. Furthermore, the pulsed electron impact excitation during the field reversal phase, typical for hydrogen CCRF discharges, is exploited for measurements of atomic and molecular data like lifetimes of excited states, coefficients for radiationless collisional de-excitation (quenching coefficients), and cascading processes from higher electronic states.

In Ar/O2 mixtures the electron density and the ion flux vary in a very similar way (i.e. their ratio, υ, is constant), in good agreement with the simple electropositive transport theory. Both 27 and 2 MHz RF powers have a significant effect on the plasma density and the ion flux. The effect of the 2 MHz power is likely a combination of enhanced plasma heating by dual-frequency excitation and ionization caused by secondary electron beams, which are known to be produced efficiently at oxidized silicon surfaces. In contrast, in Ar/C4F8/O2 mixtures such as those used for industrial dielectric etching, υ is always bigger than the theoretical electropositive value, and becomes very high when the ratio of 2 to 27 MHz power is high. Under these conditions the electron density is very small, whereas the ion flux remains considerable. We attribute the increased plasma transport to the presence of a significant density of F− negative ions, combined with increased penetration of the 2 MHz electric field into the plasma bulk at high 2/27 MHz power ratios.}

A practical understanding of such discharges requires, among other things, a quantitative appreciation of the mechanisms involved in heating electrons, since this heating is the proximate cause of the ionization that sustains the plasma. When these discharges are operated at sufficiently low pressure, collisionless electron heating can be an important and even the dominant mechanism. Since the low-pressure regime is important for many applications, understanding collisionless heating is both theoretically and practically important. This review is concerned with the state of theoretical knowledge of collisionless heating in both inductive and capacitive discharges.}

Spatio-temporal distributions of the total excitation/ionization rates under variation of gas pressure, applied frequencies and gas species are discussed. Some results are compared qualitatively with an experiment (phase resolved optical emission spectroscopy) operated under conditions similar to a parameter set used in the simulation. Different modes of electron heating are identified and compared with α- and γ-mode operation of single-frequency CCRF discharges. In this context the frequency coupling and its relation to the ion density profile in the sheath are discussed and quantified. In light gases the ion density in the sheath is time modulated. This temporal modulation is well described by an analytical model and is found to affect the excitation dynamics via the frequency coupling. It is shown that the frequency coupling strongly affects the generation of beams of highly energetic electrons by the expanding sheath and field reversals caused by the collapsing sheath. The role of secondary electrons at intermediate and high pressures is clarified and the transition from α- to γ-mode operation is discussed. Depending on the gas and the corresponding cross sections for excitation/ionization the excitation does not generally probe the ionization as is usually assumed.}

	abstract = {Various types of capacitively coupled radio frequency (CCRF) discharges are frequently used for different applications ranging from chip and solar cell manufacturing to the creation of biocompatible surfaces. In many of these discharges electron heating and electron dynamics are not fully understood. A powerful diagnostic to study electron dynamics in CCRF discharges is phase resolved optical emission spectroscopy (PROES). It is non-intrusive and provides access to the dynamics of highly energetic electrons, which sustain the discharge via ionization, with high spatial and temporal resolution within the RF period. Based on a time dependent model of the excitation dynamics of specifically chosen rare gas levels PROES provides access to plasma parameters such as the electron temperature, electron density and electron energy distribution function (EEDF). In this work the method of PROES is reviewed and some examples of its application are discussed. First, the generation of highly energetic electron beams by the expanding sheath in geometrically symmetric as well as asymmetric discharges and their effect on the EEDF are investigated. Second, the physical nature of the frequency coupling in dual frequency discharges operated at substantially different frequencies is discussed. Third, the generation of electric field reversals during sheath collapse in single and dual frequency discharges is analysed. Then excitation dynamics in an electrically asymmetric novel type of dual frequency discharge is studied. Finally, limitations of PROES are discussed.}

The spatially and/or temporally varying electric field and the presence of boundaries (e.g. electrodes) in these plasma sources induce a non-hydrodynamic (or non-equilibrium) transport of some types of charged species, particularly of electrons. Particle-based methods provide, even under non-equilibrium conditions, a correct method of mathematical description of the particle transport and the determination of the distribution functions, which are crucial quantities in discharge modeling.}

	abstract = {Capacitive radio frequency (RF) discharge plasmas have been serving hi-tech industry (e.g. chip and solar cell manufacturing, realization of biocompatible surfaces) for several years. Nonetheless, their complex modes of operation are not fully understood and represent topics of high interest. The understanding of these phenomena is aided by modern diagnostic techniques and computer simulations. From the industrial point of view the control of ion properties is of particular interest; possibilities of independent control of the ion flux and the ion energy have been utilized via excitation of the discharges with multiple frequencies. ‘Classical’ dual-frequency (DF) discharges (where two significantly different driving frequencies are used), as well as discharges driven by a base frequency and its higher harmonic(s) have been analyzed thoroughly. It has been recognized that the second solution results in an electrically induced asymmetry (electrical asymmetry effect), which provides the basis for the control of the mean ion energy. This paper reviews recent advances on studies of the different electron heating mechanisms, on the possibilities of the separate control of ion energy and ion flux in DF discharges, on the effects of secondary electrons, as well as on the non-linear behavior (self-generated resonant current oscillations) of capacitive RF plasmas. The work is based on a synergistic approach of theoretical modeling, experiments and kinetic simulations based on the particle-in-cell approach.}

	abstract = {Electron heating and ionization dynamics in capacitively coupled radio frequency (RF) atmospheric pressure microplasmas operated in helium are investigated by particle-in-cell simulations and semi-analytical modeling. A strong heating of electrons and ionization in the plasma bulk due to high bulk electric fields are observed at distinct times within the RF period. Based on the model the electric field is identified to be a drift field caused by a low electrical conductivity due to the high electron–neutral collision frequency at atmospheric pressure. Thus, the ionization is mainly caused by ohmic heating in this ‘Ω-mode’. The phase of strongest bulk electric field and ionization is affected by the driving voltage amplitude. At high amplitudes, the plasma density is high, so that the sheath impedance is comparable to the bulk resistance. Thus, voltage and current are about 45° out of phase and maximum ionization is observed during sheath expansion with local maxima at the sheath edges. At low driving voltages, the plasma density is low and the discharge becomes more resistive, resulting in a smaller phase shift of about 4°. Thus, maximum ionization occurs later within the RF period with a maximum at the discharge center. Significant analogies to electronegative low-pressure macroscopic discharges operated in the drift-ambipolar mode are found, where similar mechanisms induced by a high electronegativity instead of a high collision frequency have been identified.}

The asymmetric response is produced using rf electrodes of differing materials, and hence different secondary electron emission coefficients. This asymmetry in the emission coefficients can produce a significant, measurable dc bias voltage (Vbias/Vrf ∼ 0–0.2), together with an asymmetry in the plasma density profiles and ion flux to each electrode. The dc bias formation can be understood from a particle-flux balance applied to each electrode, and results from two main effects: (1) the larger effective ion flux at each electrode due to the emission of secondary electrons and (2) ion-flux multiplication within the sheath due to ionization from these emitted secondary electrons. By making use of an empirical fit to the simulation data, the possibility of non-invasively estimating secondary electron emission coefficients in CCP systems is discussed.}

We demonstrate that changes in the electron heating dynamics induced by voltage waveform tailoring strongly affect the dc self-bias, the ion flux, Γi, and the mean ion energy, 〈Ei〉, at the electrodes. The driving voltage waveform is customized by adding N consecutive harmonics (N ⩽ 4) of 13.56 MHz with specific harmonics' amplitudes and phases. The total voltage amplitude is kept constant, while modifying the number of harmonics and their phases. In an argon plasma, we find a dc self-bias, η, to be generated via the electrical asymmetry effect for N ⩾ 2. η can be controlled by adjusting the harmonics' phases and is enhanced by adding more consecutive harmonics. At a low pressure of 3 Pa, the discharge is operated in the α-mode and 〈Ei〉 can be controlled by adjusting the phases at constant Γi. The ion flux can be increased by adding more harmonics due to the enhanced electron-sheath heating. 〈Ei〉 does not remain constant as a function of N at both electrodes due to a change in η. These findings verify previous results of Lafleur et al. At a high pressure of 100 Pa and using a high secondary electron emission coefficient of γ = 0.4, the discharge is operated in the γ-mode and mode transitions are induced by changing the driving voltage waveform. Due to these mode transitions and the specific ionization dynamics in the γ-mode, Γi is no longer constant as a function of the harmonics' phases and decreases with increasing N.}

The model allows one to calculate the electric field outside the electrode sheaths, space and time resolved within the RF period. Electrons are found to be heated by strong ambipolar electric fields outside the sheath during the phase of sheath expansion in addition to classical sheath expansion heating. By tracing individual electrons we also show that ionization is primarily caused by electrons that collide with the expanding sheath edge multiple times during one phase of sheath expansion due to backscattering toward the sheath by collisions. A synergistic combination of these different heating events during one phase of sheath expansion is required to accelerate an electron to energies above the threshold for ionization. The ambipolar electric field outside the sheath is found to be time modulated due to a time modulation of the electron mean energy caused by the presence of sheath expansion heating only during one half of the RF period at a given electrode. This time modulation results in more electron heating than cooling inside the region of high electric field outside the sheath on time average. If an electric field reversal is present during sheath collapse, this time modulation and, thus, the asymmetry between the phases of sheath expansion and collapse will be enhanced. We propose that the ambipolar electron heating should be included in models describing electron heating in capacitive RF plasmas.}

(ii) In electrically asymmetric (EA) discharges, operated at a fundamental frequency and its second harmonic (13.56 MHz + 27.12 MHz), φLF and φHF control γi, whereas the phase shift between the driving frequencies, θ, is varied to adjust <Ei>. We focus on the efect of changing the control parameter for <Ei> on the electron heating and ionization dynamics and on γi. We find that in both types of dual-frequency strongly electronegative discharges, changing the control parameter results in a complex effect on the electron heating and ionization dynamics: in classical dual-frequency discharges, besides the frequency coupling affecting the sheath expansion heating, additional frequency coupling mechanisms influence the electron heating in the plasma bulk and at the collapsing sheath edge; in EA dual-frequency discharges the electron heating in the bulk results in asymmetric ionization dynamics for values of θ around 45°, i.e., in the case of a symmetric applied voltage waveform, that affects the dc self-bias generation.",

This non-intrusive, sensitive diagnostic is based on a combination of phase resolved optical emission spectroscopy and particle-based kinetic simulations. In such plasmas (under most conditions in electropositive gases) the spatio-temporally resolved electron-impact excitation/ionization rate features two distinct maxima adjacent to each electrode at different times within each RF period. While one maximum is the consequence of the energy gain of electrons due to sheath expansion, the second maximum is produced by secondary electrons accelerated towards the plasma bulk by the sheath electric field at the time of maximum voltage drop across the adjacent sheath. Due to these different excitation/ionization mechanisms, the ratio of the intensities of these maxima is very sensitive to the secondary electron emission coefficient γ. This sensitvity, in turn, allows γ to be determined by comparing experimental excitation profiles and simulation data obtained with various γ-coefficients. The diagnostic, tested here in a geometrically symmetric argon discharge, yields an effective secondary electron emission coefficient of  for stainless steel electrodes.}

The effects on particle density profiles, the electron heating rate profile, the electron energy probability function and the sheath width are explored including and excluding the metastable oxygen molecules and secondary electron emission.

We find that including the metastable O2(b) further decreases the ohmic heating and the effective electron temperature in the bulk region. The effective electron temperature in the electronegative core is found to be less than 1 eV in the pressure range 50–200 mTorr which agrees with recent experimental findings. Furthermore, we find that including an energy-dependent secondary electron emission yield for -ions has a significant influence on the discharge properties, including decreased sheath width.}

The investigations are performed for low-pressure capacitively coupled radio frequency discharges in helium and argon. Besides a code verification by comparison with benchmark simulation results in helium it is shown that an adaptive particle management is particularly suitable for the simulation of discharges at elevated pressures where boundary effects and processes in the sheath regions are important.

Rev. Lett. 116 255002). The striations were found to result from the periodic generation of double layers due to the modulation of the densities of positive and negative ions responding to the externally applied RF potential. In this work, an in-depth analysis of the formation of striations is given, as well as the effect of the driving frequency on the plasma parameters, such as the spatially modulated charged species densities, the electric field, and the electron power absorption is studied by PROES measurements, PIC/MCC simulations, and an ion–ion plasma model. The measured spatio-temporal electronic excitation patterns at different driving frequencies show a high degree of consistency with the simulation results. The striation gap (i.e., the distance between two ion density maxima) is found to be inversely proportional to the driving frequency. In the presence of striations the minimum ( ) ion densities in the bulk region exhibit an approximately quadratic increase with the driving frequency. For these densities, the eigenfrequency of the ion–ion plasma is near the driving frequency, indicating that a resonance occurs between the positive and negative ions and the oscillating electric field inside the plasma bulk. The maximum ion densities in the plasma bulk are found not to exhibit a simple dependence on the driving frequency, since these ion densities are abnormally enhanced within a certain frequency range due to the ions being focused into the ‘striations’ by the spatially modulated electric field inside the bulk region.}

The spatio-temporal distributions of the excitation rate obtained from experiments are well reproduced by the simulations.

	abstract = {The electron power absorption dynamics in radio frequency driven micro atmospheric pressure capacitive plasma jets are studied based on experimental phase resolved optical emission spectroscopy and the computational particle in cell simulations with Monte Carlo treatment of collisions. The jet is operated at 13.56 MHz in He with different admixture concentrations of N2 and at several driving voltage amplitudes. We find the spatio-temporal dynamics of the light emission of the plasma at various wavelengths to be markedly different. This is understood by revealing the population dynamics of the upper levels of selected emission lines/bands based on comparisons between experimental and simulation results. The populations of these excited states are sensitive to different parts of the electron energy distribution function and to contributions from other excited states. Mode transitions of the electron power absorption dynamics from the Ω- to the Penning-mode are found to be induced by changing the N2 admixture concentration and the driving voltage amplitude. Our numerical simulations reveal details of this mode transition and provide novel insights into the operation details of the Penning-mode. The characteristic excitation/emission maximum at the time of maximum sheath voltage at each electrode is found to be based on two mechanisms: (i) a direct channel, i.e. excitation/emission caused by electrons generated by Penning ionization inside the sheaths and (ii) an indirect channel, i.e. secondary electrons emitted from the electrode due to the impact of positive ions generated by Penning ionization at the electrodes.}

	abstract = {Self-organized striated structure has been observed experimentally and numerically in CF4 plasmas in radio-frequency capacitively coupled plasmas recently (Liu et al 2016 Phys. Rev. Lett. 116 255002). In this work, the striated structure is investigated in a capacitively coupled oxygen discharge with the introduction of the effect from the secondary electron emission, based on a particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision model. As we know, the transport of positive and negative ions plays a key role in the formation of striations in electronegative gases, for which, the electronegativity needs to be large enough. As the secondary electron emission increases, electrons in the sheaths gradually contribute more ionization to the discharge. Meanwhile, the increase of the electron density, especially in the plasma bulk, leads to an increased electrical conductivity and a reduced bulk electric field, which would shield the ions’ mobility. These changes result in enlarged striation gaps. And then, with more emitted electrons, obvious disruption of the striations is observed accompanied with a transition of electron heating mode. Due to the weakened field, the impact ionization in the plasma bulk is attenuated, compared with the enhanced ionization caused by secondary electrons. This would lead to the electron heating mode transition from striated (STR) mode to γ-mode. Besides, our investigation further reveals that γ-mode is more likely to dominate the discharge under high gas pressures or driving voltages.}

In this paper the question of the main reactions which contribute most to the ion composition is being studied in an asymmetric dual-frequency rf CCP discharge with an applied rf-bias. A combination of experiment with a numerical scheme developed on the base of the particle-in-cell model with Monte-Carlo collisions is applied. The mass-spectrometer is used for measuring the ion composition at the discharge chamber wall, while the ion composition on the surface of an rf-biased electrode is estimated from the retarded field energy analyzer measurements to establish the role of the sheath processes in the ion composition. It is shown that the main ions are H3
	+, Ar+ and ArH+ but their relative concentrations strongly depend on the initial H2 content in the mixture. The processes in the bulk plasma are revealed to be determinative for the ion composition whereas the sheath processes do not have a significant effect under the conditions considered.}

This paper reviews the current knowledge about the fundamental processes, structures, dynamics, and functions of high-frequency electronegative plasmas investigated over the past 30 years, and discusses the hidden characteristics originating from a majority of positive and negative ions and a minority of electrons. A unique structure with a negative ion layer is emphasized in terms of the sustaining mechanism underlying capacitively coupled plasma. In a strong electronegativity, the main sustaining mechanism is caused by a cluster of ionizations placed in front of the instantaneous anode by a minority of electrons accelerated from the bulk plasma into the active double layer. A new insight is obtained for how to hold a bulk plasma. The bulk plasma is maintained by a time-averaged net ionization rate equal to the electron attachment by minority electrons under the assistance of a relatively high reduced field E(t)/N

The rf sheath is assumed to be collisionless and oscillates with external source. A known sinusoidal voltage instead of current is taken as prerequisite to derive sheath dynamics. Kinetic studies are performed to determine mean wall potential as a function of secondary emission coefficient and applied voltage amplitude, with which the complete mean direct current sheath is resolved. Analytical analyses under homogeneous model and numerical analyses under inhomogeneous model are conducted to deduce real-time sheath properties including space potential, sheath capacitance, and stochastic heating. Obtained results are validated by a continuum kinetic simulation without ionization. The influences of collisionality and ionization induced by secondary electrons are elucidated with a particle-in-cell simulation, which further formalizes proposed theories and inspires future works.},

Here we explore further the transition as pressure and electrode separation are varied. At fixed electrode spacing of 45 mm when operating at low pressure (10 mTorr) the electron heating is a combination of DA- and α-mode heating while at higher pressures (>30 mTorr) electron heating in the sheath regions dominates. When varying the electrode spacing from 25 to 60 mm at fixed operating pressure at the higher pressures (50 mTorr) the electron heating is a combination of DA- and α-mode heating for small electrode spacing and it transitions to pure α-mode heating as the electrode spacing is increased. We relate the transition to increased electronegativity and generation of drift and ambipolar electric field within the electronegative core when the discharge pressure is low or electrode spacing is small.}

	abstract = {The ion-induced secondary electron emission coefficient (γ) is a vital parameter in the modeling of low temperature RF plasmas. Often, the value of γ drastically affects the electron power absorption dynamics, the plasma parameters and the quality of the separate control of ion flux and mean ion energy at the electrodes. Experimental results for γ under plasma exposure are difficult to obtain. Therefore, γ is either assumed to be a constant chosen with some uncertainty, or is approximated as a quantity that is a function of the ion energy and cleanliness of the electrode surface. It is hypothesized that these assumptions are not valid for all materials and plasma conditions. In this work, Hagstrum’s theory on Auger emission is suggested as a robust, ab initio model for accurately predicting γ for metal surfaces with a wide range of surface conditions and for a variety of ion species. To demonstrate the effect of the choice of γ on modeling results, we carry out particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision simulations of 13.56 MHz, single-frequency argon and helium capacitive discharges. Simulations are run assuming that: (i) γ is a constant, (ii) γ is an energy and surface condition dependent quantity that is independent of the electrode material, and (iii) γ is obtained from the ab initio model for different clean metals. The energy distribution of the emitted electrons resulting from Hagstrum’s theory is also implemented as a uniform, metal dependent distribution with physically accurate energy domain. It is found that this is important for some metals in both helium and argon. Lastly, it is observed that, depending on the assumed surface conditions, the plasma properties change dramatically. Based on these results we conclude that a realistic, material dependent implementation of γ is required to obtain realistic simulation results and that Hagstrum’s model suits this purpose.}

	abstract = {Kinetic effects of plasma-dielectric interaction are studied theoretically with respect to the mechanisms of electron extraction from solids in response to ion and electron bombardment, coupled with plasma dynamics of a weakly emissive sheath. Emission coefficients of incident beams are first calculated by quantum mechanical as well as semi-classical approaches involving Auger neutralization, energy-dependent ejection due to primary beam, and reflection of low-energy electrons, which are then incorporated into a 1D1V simulation and plasma kinetic theory. Presheath with sheath structures are derived using fluid and kinetic theory regarding ion-induced emission, respectively. The Bohm criterion considering surface emission is evaluated as well. For electron-induced emission, it is found that sheath potential is no longer collinear with plasma electron temperature in our integrated model. Additionally, reflection of low-energy electrons is justified to have a minor impact on the floating sheath for low temperature half-bounded plasma under low pressure. The combined effects of both incident ions and electrons in bounded plasma are analyzed with symmetrical/asymmetrical emission yields at two boundaries. It is then proved that wall potential is barely affected by bulk plasma influx if emission coefficients are symmetrical, while emission due to transiting beam can drastically modify the sheath solution. Electron reflection also becomes more influential if secondary electrons have low initial energy. Finally, we summarize different roles of ion and electron in sheath structure. It is shown that ion-induced emission mitigates sheath potential but cannot reach critical emission on contrast to that of electron flux.}

abstract = {Secondary electron emission (SEE) yields obtained with empirical models deviate significantly from experiment. Therefore they cannot be used to predict the SEE data for various materials. The angular dependencies of SEE in empirical models are also drastically different and inconvenient for comparison. SEE coefficients were calculated by a theoretical method that uses Monte Carlo simulation, empirical theories, and close comparison to experiment, in order to parameterize the SEE yields of highly emissive materials. We have successfully applied this method to bulk Al2O3, a highly emissive material for micro-channel plates, as well as to thinly deposited films of Al2O3. The simulation results will be used in the selection of an emissive material, and if the emission yield of the material is small, as a resistive material for the deposition and characterization experiments that will be conducted by a large-area fast detector project at Argonne National Laboratory.}

journal = {Plasma Sources Sci. Technol.},
abstract = {Two fundamentally different types of dual-frequency (DF) capacitively coupled radio frequency discharges can be used for plasma processing applications to realize separate control of the ion mean energy, ⟨Ei⟩, and the ion flux, Γi, at the substrate surface: (i) classical discharges operated at substantially different frequencies, where the low- and high-frequency voltage amplitudes, ϕlf and ϕhf, are used to control ⟨Ei⟩ and Γi, respectively; (ii) electrically asymmetric (EA) discharges operated at a fundamental frequency and its second harmonic with fixed, but adjustable phase shift between the driving frequencies, θ. In EA discharges the voltage amplitudes are used to control Γi and θ is used to control ⟨Ei⟩. Here, we report our systematic simulation studies of the effect of secondary electrons on the ionization dynamics and the quality of this separate control in both discharge types in argon at different gas pressures. We focus on the effect of the control parameter for ⟨Ei⟩ on Γi for different secondary yields, γ. We find a dramatic effect of tuning ϕlf in classical DF discharges, which is caused by a transition from α- to γ-mode induced by changing ϕlf. In EA discharges we find that no such mode transition is induced by changing θ within the parameter range studied here and, consequently, Γi remains nearly constant as a function of θ. Thus, despite some limitations at high values of γ the quality of the separate control of ion energy and flux is generally better in EA discharges compared with classical DF discharges.}

abstract = {A systematic study of different modes of electron heating in dual-frequency capacitively coupled radio frequency (CCRF) discharges is performed using a particle-in-cell simulation. Spatio-temporal distributions of the total excitation/ionization rates under variation of gas pressure, applied frequencies and gas species are discussed. Some results are compared qualitatively with an experiment (phase resolved optical emission spectroscopy) operated under conditions similar to a parameter set used in the simulation. Different modes of electron heating are identified and compared with α- and γ-mode operation of single-frequency CCRF discharges. In this context the frequency coupling and its relation to the ion density profile in the sheath are discussed and quantified. In light gases the ion density in the sheath is time modulated. This temporal modulation is well described by an analytical model and is found to affect the excitation dynamics via the frequency coupling. It is shown that the frequency coupling strongly affects the generation of beams of highly energetic electrons by the expanding sheath and field reversals caused by the collapsing sheath. The role of secondary electrons at intermediate and high pressures is clarified and the transition from α- to γ-mode operation is discussed. Depending on the gas and the corresponding cross sections for excitation/ionization the excitation does not generally probe the ionization as is usually assumed.}

abstract = {In capacitively coupled radio frequency discharges driven by two consecutive phase-locked harmonics, the electrical asymmetry effect (EAE) allows one to generate a dc self-bias as a function of the phase shift, θ, between the driving harmonics. If the two frequencies are chosen to be 13.56 and 27.12 MHz, the mean ion energy at both electrodes can be varied by a factor of about 2 by tuning θ at nearly constant ion flux. Until now the EAE has only been investigated in discharges operated at a fundamental frequency of f = 13.56 MHz. Here, we study the effect of changing this fundamental frequency on the performance of the EAE, i.e. on the electrical generation of a dc self-bias, the control range of the mean ion energy, and on the ion flux at both electrodes as a function of θ, by kinetic particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo simulations and theoretical modelling. We use argon gas and cover a wide range of fundamental frequencies (0.5 MHz ⩽ f ⩽ 60 MHz) and secondary electron yields. We find that the performance of the EAE is significantly worse at lower frequencies, i.e. the control range of the dc self-bias and, thus, the control range of the mean ion energy are strongly reduced. Based on the analytical model (i) the enhanced charged dynamics at lower frequencies and (ii) the transition of the electron heating mode induced by changing f are found to be the reasons for this effect.}

journal = {J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys.},
abstract = {A fundamental problem in technological plasmas has been how to control the ion energy and the ion flux (plasma density) independently of one another. A simple, but previously overlooked asymmetry effect is reported that should allow a high degree of control of the ion energy. The idea is that when a temporally symmetric, multi-frequency voltage waveform containing one or more even harmonics is applied to a discharge, even a geometrically symmetric one, the two sheaths are necessarily asymmetric. To balance the charged particle fluxes, a dc self-bias develops. Optimally, this is achieved with a dual frequency discharge that uses the phase locked fundamental and its second harmonic. The resulting dc self-bias and hence the ion energy are a nearly linear function of the phase angle between the two applied RF voltages. This works even for geometrically symmetric discharges, and the roles of the two electrodes can be reversed using the phase. This means that the technique can be used to increase or decrease the ion energy striking a substrate while leaving the applied RF voltage and frequency and thereby the discharge parameters effectively unchanged.}

abstract = {Recently a novel approach for achieving separate control of ion flux and energy in capacitively coupled radio frequency (CCRF) discharges based on the electrical asymmetry effect (EAE) was proposed (Heil et al 2008 J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 41 165202). If the applied, temporally symmetric voltage waveform contains an even harmonic of the fundamental frequency, the sheaths in front of the two electrodes are necessarily asymmetric. A dc self-bias develops and is a function of the phase angle between the driving voltages. By tuning the phase, precise and convenient control of the ion energy can be achieved while the ion flux stays constant. This effect works even in geometrically symmetric discharges and the role of the two electrodes can be reversed electrically. In this work the EAE is verified using a particle in cell simulation of a geometrically symmetric dual-frequency CCRF discharge operated at 13.56 and 27.12 MHz. The self-bias is a nearly linear function of the phase angle. It is shown explicitly that the ion flux stays constant within ±5 \%, while the self-bias reaches values of up to 80 \% of the applied voltage amplitude and the maximum ion energy is changed by a factor of 3 for a set of low pressure discharge conditions investigated. The EAE is investigated at different pressures and electrode gaps. As geometrically symmetric discharges can be made electrically asymmetric via the EAE, the plasma series resonance effect is observed for the first time in simulations of a geometrically symmetric discharge.}

journal = {Plasma Sources Sci. Technol.},
abstract = {In plasma etching for microelectronics fabrication, a sheath electric field accelerates ions into the substrate so they strike at normal incidence, contributing energy and reactive species to enable anisotropic etch profiles. The energy of the bombarding ions is typically controlled coarsely with a sinusoidal bias voltage applied to the substrate electrode, producing a broad bimodal ion energy distribution (IED) at the substrate. By systematically tailoring the shape of the waveform, the energies and relative fluxes of the two IED peaks are varied independently over a 100–500 eV range in a fluorocarbon-based helicon plasma, while silicon dioxide and photoresist etch rates are monitored. A 100 eV IED peak was combined with a higher energy peak, with the energy and relative flux of the high energy group as variables in the experiment. A relatively small contribution of high energy ions is found to lead to considerable etch rate enhancement, higher than predicted by a linear combination of single-peak etch rates at the two energies. Because high energy ion bombardment is known to suppress fluorocarbon deposition, it seems likely that changes in surface chemical composition in their presence enhances the contribution of lower energy ions to etching reactions.}

Controlling the width and shape of the IED can potentially improve etch selectivity by distinguishing between threshold energies of surface processes. In this article, control of the IED was computationally investigated by applying a tailored, nonsinusoidal bias waveform to the substrate of an inductively coupled plasma. The waveform we investigated, a quasi-dc negative bias having a short positive pulse each cycle, produced a narrow IED whose width was controllable based on the length of the positive spike and frequency. We found that the selectivity between etching Si and SiO2 in fluorocarbon plasmas could be controlled by adjusting the width and energy of the IED. Control of the energy of a narrow IED enables etching recipes that transition between speed and selectivity without change of gas mixture.}",

abstract = {The modelling of low temperature plasmas for fundamental investigations and equipment design is challenged by conflicting goals—having detailed, specialized algorithms which address sometimes subtle physical phenomena while also being flexible enough to address a wide range of process conditions. Hybrid modelling (HM) is a technique which provides many opportunities to address both fundamental physics and practical matters of equipment design. HM is a hierarchical approach in which modules addressing different physical processes on vastly disparate timescales are iteratively combined using time-slicing techniques. By compartmentalizing the physics in each module to accept given inputs and produce required outputs, different algorithms can be used to represent the same physical processes. In this manner, the algorithms best suited for the conditions of interest can be used without affecting other modules. In this paper, the basis and implementation of HM are discussed using examples from simulations of inductively coupled plasmas.}

This hybrid model could enjoy great accuracy in predicting the nonequilibrium phenomena in capacitively coupled plasmas (CCPs) and meanwhile avoid the limitation caused by the computational cost. Benchmarking against the well-established particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collision (PIC/MCC) method and comparison with experimental data have been presented both in electropositive N2 discharges and electronegative O2 discharges. The results indicate that in N2 discharges, the ion density evolves from a uniform distribution to an edge-high profile as power increases. Besides, the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) at the bulk center exhibits a “hole” at about 3 eV, and the “hole” becomes less obvious at the radial edge, because more low energy electrons are generated there. In O2 discharges, the EEDF exhibits a Druyvesteyn-like distribution in the bulk region, and it evolves to a Maxwellian distribution in the sheath, indicating the dominant influence of the electric field heating there. The results obtained by the hybrid model agree well with those calculated by the PIC/MCC method, as well as those measured by double probe, except for slight discrepancy in absolute values. The qualitative agreement achieved in this work validates the potential of this hybrid model as an effective tool in the deep understanding of the plasma properties, as well as in the improvement of the plasma processing.}

    abstract = "{Plasma etching of high aspect ratio (HAR) features, typically vias, is a critical step in the fabrication of high capacity memory. With aspect ratios (ARs) exceeding 50 (and approaching 100), maintaining critical dimensions (CDs) while eliminating or diminishing twisting, contact-edge-roughening, and aspect ratio dependent etching (ARDE) becomes challenging. Integrated reactor and feature scale modeling was used to investigate the etching of HAR features in SiO2 with ARs up to 80 using tri-frequency capacitively coupled plasmas sustained in Ar/C4F8/O2 mixtures. In these systems, the fluxes of neutral radicals to the wafer exceed the fluxes of ions by 1–2 orders of magnitude due to lower threshold energies for dissociation compared with ionization. At low ARs (\\&lt;5), these abundant fluxes of CFx and CxFy radicals to the etch front passivate the oxide to form a complex which is then removed by energetic species (ions and hot neutrals) through chemically enhanced reactive etching, resulting in the formation of gas phase SiFx, COx, and COF. As the etching proceeds into higher ARs, the fractional contribution of physical sputtering to oxide removal increases as the fluxes of energetic species to the etch front surpass those of the conduction constrained CFx and CxFy radicals. The instantaneous etch rate of oxide decreases with increasing aspect ratio (ARDE effect) due to decreased fluxes of energetic species and decreased power delivered by these species to the etch front. As the etch rate of photoresist (PR) is independent of AR, maintaining CDs by avoiding undercut and bowing requires high SiO2-over-PR selectivity, which in turn requires a minimum thickness of the PR at the end of etching. Positive ions with narrow angular distributions typically deposit charge on the bottom of low AR features, producing a maximum in positive electric potential on the bottom of the feature. For high AR features, grazing incidence collisions of ions on sidewalls depositing charge produce electric potentials with maxima on the sidewalls (as opposed to the bottom) of the feature.}",

generated through surface neutralisation of ions},
journal = {Europhys. Lett.},
abstract = {Hydrogen ions (H+, H2+ and H3+) are produced in a magnetically confined inductively coupled radio frequency plasma. Ions are accelerated in the plasma boundary sheath potential, of several hundred volts, in front of a biased metal electrode immersed in the plasma. Backscattered hyperthermal hydrogen atoms are investigated by optical emission spectroscopy and an energy-resolved mass spectrometer. Ionisation of fast neutrals through electron stripping of atoms in the plasma allows energy analysis of the resulting ions. Thereby, the energy distribution function of the hyperthermal atoms can be deduced. The energy spectra can be explained as a superposition of individual spectra of the various ion species. The measured spectra also shows contributions of negative ions created at the electrode surface. In addition to experimental measurements, simulations of the neutral flux of backscattered atoms are carried out.}

journal = {J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys.},
abstract = {Dual frequency, capacitively coupled plasma (DF-CCP) tools are now being used for etching of 30 cm diameter wafers during microelectronics fabrication. These tools typically use a high frequency (HF, tens to hundreds of megahertz) to sustain the plasma and a low frequency (LF, a few to 10 MHz) for ion acceleration into the wafer. With an increase in both the HF and the wafer size, electromagnetic (EM) wave effects can significantly affect power deposition and the distribution of the plasma due to constructive interference at the centre of the wafer. Here we report on a computational demonstration of using graded conductivity electrodes (GCEs) to improve the plasma uniformity in a DF-CCP reactor. GCEs consist of a metal electrode covered by a dielectric which is in direct contact with the plasma. The conductivity of the dielectric decreases from edge to centre. So as the HF wave propagates inwards from the edge of the electrode, the penetration of the HF field into the dielectric increases. This increasing penetration counteracts the increase in the electric field resulting from the constructive interference of the EM wave at the centre of the reactor, and hence improves the uniformity of the resulting plasma.}

journal = {Plasma Sources Science and Technology},
abstract = {The spatio-temporal ionization and excitation dynamics in low-pressure radiofrequency (RF) discharges operated in neon are studied and a detailed comparison of experimental and kinetic simulation results is provided for a wide parameter regime. Phase resolved optical emission spectroscopy (PROES) measurements and 1d3v particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collisions (PIC/MCC) simulations are performed in a geometrically symmetric capacitively coupled plasma (CCP) reactor at driving frequencies ranging from 3.39 MHz to 13.56 MHz, pressures between 60 Pa and 500 Pa, at a peak-to-peak voltage of 330 V. We examine the applicability of PROES (which provides information about the spatio-temporal distribution of the electron-impact excitation dynamics from the ground state into the Ne 2p1 state) to probe the discharge operation mode in neon (which is determined by the spatio-temporal distribution of the ionization dynamics). We find that the spatio-temporal excitation rates measured by PROES are in a good agreement with the excitation rates obtained from the PIC/MCC simulations, for all the discharge conditions studied here. However, the ionization dynamics is found to be significantly different from the excitation dynamics under most of the discharge conditions studied here, especially at higher values of the driving frequency and lower values of the pressure, when energetic heavy particle induced secondary electrons (γ-electrons) are more likely to ionize than to excite. PROES does not probe the discharge operation mode under these conditions. At a fixed frequency and peak-to-peak voltage, the spatio-temporal distribution of the ionization rate obtained from PIC/MCC simulations shows a transition of the discharge operation mode from the α-mode to the γ-mode by increasing the pressure. However, PROES fails to show this transition. While in the spatio-temporal distribution of the excitation rate obtained from the PROES measurements and the PIC/MCC simulations the α-peak (the intensity maximum at the bulk side of the expanding sheath edge) is dominant and a γ-peak (a maximum near the edge of the fully expanded sheath) becomes visible only at high values of the pressure or at the lowest frequency of 3.39 MHz, a γ-peak is visible in the ionization rate for all operation conditions, and it dominates the ionization in the vast majority of the cases investigated.}

abstract = {Particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collisions simulations are performed to study the effects of electron induced secondary electrons (SEs) in single-frequency (13.56 MHz) capacitively coupled oxygen discharges operated in the low-pressure regime ( Pa). A comparison of the plasma parameters is presented based on different surface models in the simulations. Both for electrons and ions, simple and realistic approaches are used to model their interactions with the electrode material. The simple approaches use constant coefficients (electron reflection, SE emission), irrespectively of the discharge conditions and the surface properties, while the realistic surface coefficients are functions of the energy of the particles hitting the electrode and depend on the surface properties. When electron induced secondary electron emission (SEE) is accounted for, a complex electron emission and ionization dynamics of ion induced γ- and electron induced δ-electrons is found. When both the electron and ion induced SEE is described by energy dependent surface coefficients, an exponential increase of the plasma density and the O2(a1Δg) metastable concentration is observed by increasing the driving voltage amplitude, as well as a strong decrease of the electronegativity of the discharge and a transition of the discharge operation mode from the drift-ambipolar mode to the α-mode are found to take place.}

title = {Electron power absorption in capacitively coupled neon–oxygen plasmas: a comparison of experimental and computational results},
journal = {Plasma Sources Sci. Technol.},
abstract = {Phase resolved optical emission spectroscopy (PROES) measurements combined with 1d3v particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collisions (PIC/MCC) simulations are used to study the electron power absorption and excitation/ionization dynamics in capacitively coupled plasmas (CCPs) in mixtures of neon and oxygen gases. The study is performed for a geometrically symmetric CCP reactor with a gap length of 2.5 cm at a driving frequency of 10 MHz and a peak-to-peak voltage of 350 V. The pressure of the gas mixture is varied between 15 Pa and 500 Pa, while the neon/oxygen concentration is tuned between 10\% and 90\%. For all discharge conditions, the spatio-temporal distributions of the electron-impact excitation rate from the Ne ground state into the Ne 2p53p0 state measured by PROES and obtained from PIC/MCC simulations show good qualitative agreement. Based on the emission/excitation patterns, multiple operation regimes are identified. Localized bright emission features at the bulk boundaries, caused by local maxima in the electronegativity are found at high pressures and high O2 concentrations. The relative contributions of the ambipolar and the Ohmic electron power absorption are found to vary strongly with the discharge parameters: the Ohmic power absorption is enhanced by both the high collisionality at high pressures and the high electronegativity at low pressures. In the wide parameter regime covered in this study, the PROES measurements are found to accurately represent the ionization dynamics, i.e. the discharge operation mode. This work represents also a successful experimental validation of the discharge model developed for neon–oxygen CCPs.}

journal = {Plasma Sources Sci. Technol.},
abstract = {We present a new method for the determination of surface coefficients, more specifically the effective ion-induced secondary electron yield, γ eff, and the effective elastic electron reflection coefficient, r eff, by means of a synergistic combination of energy-selective mass spectrometry measurements and numerical particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo collisions simulations of the ion flux-energy distribution function (IEDF) in a symmetric capacitively coupled plasma (CCP). In particular, we analyze the bimodal peak structure of the IEDF, which is caused by ions crossing the sheath without collisions. The position and width of this structure on the energy scale are defined by the time-averaged sheath potential and the ion transit time through the sheath, respectively. We find that both characteristics are differently influenced by γ eff and r eff. The ion-induced secondary electrons are accelerated in the large sheath potential and mainly influence the plasma density, sheath width and, consequently, the ion transit time and in this way the bimodal peak separation. Electron reflection from the electrodes acts mainly at times of sheath collapse, where low energy electrons can reach the surfaces. Their contribution to the plasma density increase is small, however, their longer residence time in the vicinity of the electrodes modifies the space charge density and the potential gradient. Additionally, the charge balance at the electrode requires an incident electron flux that is correlated to the flux of emitted ion induced secondary electrons and reflected electrons, which is realized by a change of the electron repelling sheath voltage. As a consequence, the electron reflection coefficient mainly influences the sheath potential and, hence, the position of the bimodal peak structure. These effects allow the simultaneous in situ determination of both surface parameters. The parameter values determined for stainless steel and Al2O3 surfaces are in good agreement with literature data. Our method opens a straightforward way of obtaining γ eff and r eff under realistic plasma conditions.}

abstract = {We report experimental and particle-based kinetic simulation studies of low-pressure capacitively coupled oxygen plasmas driven by tailored voltage waveforms that consist of up to four harmonics of base frequency 13.56 MHz. Experimentally determined values of DC self-bias and electrical power deposition, as well as flux density and flux-energy distribution of the positive ions at the grounded electrode are compared with simulation data for a wide range of operating conditions. Very good agreement is found for self-bias and flux-energy distribution of the positive ions at the electrodes, while a fair agreement is reached for discharge power and ion flux data. The simulated spatial and temporal behaviour of the electric field, electron density, electron power absorption, ionization rate and mean electron energy shows a transition between sheath expansion heating and drift-ambipolar discharge modes, induced by changing either the number of harmonics comprising the excitation waveform or the gas pressure. The simulations indicate that under our experimental conditions the plasma operates at high electronegativity, and also reveal the crucial role of  singlet metastable molecules in establishing discharge behavior via the fast destruction of negative ions within the bulk plasma.}

However, there is a long-standing issue that the plasma density determined by PIC/MCC simulations shows quantitative deviations from experimental measurements, even in argon discharges, indicating that certain physics may be missing in previous modelling the low pressure rf driven capacitive discharges. In this work, we report that the energetic electron-induced secondary electron emission and excited state atoms play an important role in low pressure rf capacitive argon plasma discharges. The ion-induced secondary electrons are accelerated by the high sheath field to strike the opposite electrode and produce a considerable number of secondary electrons that produce additional ionizing impacts and further increase the plasma density. Importantly, the presence of excited state species even&#xD;further enhances the plasma density via excited state neutral and resonant state photon-induced secondary electron emission on the electrode surface. The PIC/MCC simulation results show good agreement with the recent experimental measurements in the low pressure range (1-10Pa) that is commonly used in the etching semiconductor industry. At the highest pressure (20Pa) and&#xD;driving voltage amplitudes 250 and 350V explored here, the plasma densities from PIC/MCC simulations considering excited state neutrals and resonant photon-induced secondary electron emission are quantitatively higher than the experiments, requiring further investigation on high pressure discharges.}

journal = {Plasma Sources Sci. Technol.},
abstract = {Understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of charged particles in low pressure radio frequency capacitively coupled plasmas (CCP) is the basis for knowledge based process development in these plasma sources. Due to the importance of kinetic non-local effects the particle in cell/Monte Carlo collision (PIC/MCC) simulation became the primary modeling approach. However, due to computational limitations most previous PIC/MCC simulations were restricted to spatial resolution in one dimension. Additionally, most previous studies were based on oversimplified treatments of plasma-surface interactions. Overcoming these problems could clearly lead to a more realistic description of the physics of these plasma sources. In this work, the effects of the reactor geometry in combination with realistic heavy particle and electron induced secondary electron emission coefficients (SEEC) on the charged particle dynamics are revealed by GPU based 2D3V PIC/MCC simulations of argon discharges operated at 0.5 Pa and at a high voltage amplitude of 1000 V. The geometrical reactor asymmetry as well as the SEECs are found to affect the power absorption dynamics and distribution functions of electrons and ions strongly by determining the sheath voltages and widths adjacent to powered and grounded surface elements as well as via the self-excitation of the plasma series resonance. It is noticed that secondary electrons play important roles even at low pressures. Electron induced secondary electrons (δ-electrons) are found to cause up to half of the total ionization, while heavy particle induced secondary electrons (γ-electrons) do not cause much ionization directly, but induce most of the δ-electron emission from boundary surfaces. The fundamental insights obtained into the 2D-space resolved charged particle dynamics are used to understand the formation of energy distribution functions of electrons and ions for different reactor geometries and surface conditions.}

abstract = {The effects of the simultaneous presence of two different types of plasma asymmetry, viz, geometric and electrical, on low-pressure capacitively coupled argon discharges are studied by 2D3V graphics-processing-unit-based particle-in-cell/Monte Carlo simulations. The geometric asymmetry originates from the different powered vs grounded electrode surface areas, while the electrical asymmetry is established by applying peaks/valleys and sawtooth-up/-down driving voltage waveforms. While in geometrically symmetric discharges, the {peaks ↔ valleys} and the {sawtooth-down ↔ sawtooth-up} switching of the waveforms is equivalent to exchanging the powered and grounded electrodes, this transformation is violated when the geometric symmetry is broken. Under such conditions, the plasma characteristics and the DC self-bias generation behave differently, compared to the geometrically symmetric case. This leads to different sheath dynamics and, therefore, strongly influences the electron power absorption dynamics. For identical peak-to-peak voltages, the plasma density obtained for such tailored voltage waveforms is found to be higher compared to the classical single-frequency waveform case. Reduced plasma densities are found in the valleys- and sawtooth-down waveform cases, compared to the peaks- and sawtooth-up waveforms. By including realistic energy and material-dependent secondary electron emission (SEE) coefficients in the simulations, the electron-induced SEE is found to be reduced in the valleys- and sawtooth-down waveform cases, which explains the behaviour of the plasma density. Using such tailored waveforms in geometrically asymmetric discharges is also found to lead to the formation of different charged particle energy distributions at the boundary surfaces, compared to those in geometrically symmetric plasma sources.}

journal = {Plasma Sources Sci. Technol.},
abstract = {Ion-induced secondary electron emission at a target surface is an essential mechanism for laboratory plasmas, i.e. magnetron sputtering discharges. Electron emission, however, is strongly affected by the target condition itself such as oxidation. Data of oxidized targets, however, are very sparse and prone to significant systematic errors, because they were often determined by modeling the complex behavior of the plasma. Thus, it is difficult to isolate the process of ion-induced electron emission from all other plasma-surface-interactions. By utilizing ion beams, the complex plasma environment is avoided and electron yields are determined with higher accuracy. In this study, ion-induced secondary electron emission coefficients (SEECs) of clean, untreated (air-exposed), and intentionally oxidized copper and nickel surfaces were investigated in such a particle beam experiment. Pristine and oxidized metal foils were exposed to beams of singly charged argon ions with energies of 0.2 keV - 10 keV. After the ion beam treatment, the surface conditions were analyzed by ex-situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. Further, a model for the electron emission of a partly oxidized surface is presented, which is in agreement with the experimental data. It was found, that oxidized and untreated/air-exposed surfaces do not show the same SEEC: for intentionally oxidized targets, the electron yields were smaller by a factor of 2 than for untreated/air-exposed surfaces. SEECs of oxides were found to be between the values for clean and for untreated metal surfaces. Further, the SEEC was at maximum for untreated/air-exposed surfaces and at minimum for clean surfaces; the electron yields of untreated/air-exposed and clean surfaces were in agreement with values reported in the literature.}
