  "abstract": "We consider finitary approximations of the (embedding) Ramsey property. Using a class of homogeneous reducts of random ordered hypergraphs, we prove that these properties form a strict hierarchy. We also show that every class of finite structures in which every structure of size at most 2 is a \"Ramsey object\" essentially consists of ordered structures, generalising a known result for countable Ramsey classes.",
