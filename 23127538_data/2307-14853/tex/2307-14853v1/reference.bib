abstract={Applications such as simulating complicated quantum systems or solving large-scale linear algebra problems are very challenging for classical computers, owing to the extremely high computational cost. Quantum computers promise a solution, although fault-tolerant quantum computers will probably not be available in the near future. Current quantum devices have serious constraints, including limited numbers of qubits and noise processes that limit circuit depth. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), which use a classical optimizer to train a parameterized quantum circuit, have emerged as a leading strategy to address these constraints. VQAs have now been proposed for essentially all applications that researchers have envisaged for quantum computers, and they appear to be the best hope for obtaining quantum advantage. Nevertheless, challenges remain, including the trainability, accuracy and efficiency of VQAs. Here we overview the field of VQAs, discuss strategies to overcome their challenges and highlight the exciting prospects for using them to obtain quantum advantage.},

	abstract = {Quantum simulation of chemical systems is one of the most promising near-term applications of quantum computers. The variational quantum eigensolver, a leading algorithm for molecular simulations on quantum hardware, has a serious limitation in that it typically relies on a pre-selected wavefunction ansatz that results in approximate wavefunctions and energies. Here we present an arbitrarily accurate variational algorithm that, instead of fixing an ansatz upfront, grows it systematically one operator at a time in a way dictated by the molecule being simulated. This generates an ansatz with a small number of parameters, leading to shallow-depth circuits. We present numerical simulations, including for a prototypical strongly correlated molecule, which show that our algorithm performs much better than a unitary coupled cluster approach, in terms of both circuit depth and chemical accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of our adaptive algorithm for exact simulations with present-day and near-term quantum hardware.},

	abstract = {Integer factorization has been one of the cornerstone applications of the field of quantum computing since the discovery of an efficient algorithm for factoring by Peter Shor. Unfortunately, factoring via Shor's algorithm is well beyond the capabilities of today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. In this work, we revisit the problem of factoring, developing an alternative to Shor's algorithm, which employs established techniques to map the factoring problem to the ground state of an Ising Hamiltonian. The proposed variational quantum factoring (VQF) algorithm starts by simplifying equations over Boolean variables in a preprocessing step to reduce the number of qubits needed for the Hamiltonian. Then, it seeks an approximate ground state of the resulting Ising Hamiltonian by training variational circuits using the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA). We benchmark the VQF algorithm on various instances of factoring and present numerical results on its performance.},

Understanding how these two computing paradigms work in tandem is critical for identifying areas where such hybrid algorithms could provide a quantum advantage. In this work, we study a QAOA-based quantum optimization approach by implementing the Variational Quantum Factoring (VQF) algorithm. We execute experimental demonstrations using a superconducting quantum processor, and investigate the trade off between quantum resources (number of qubits and circuit depth) and the probability that a given biprime is successfully factored. In our experiments, the integers 1099551473989, 3127, and 6557 are factored with 3, 4, and 5 qubits, respectively, using a QAOA ansatz with up to 8 layers and we are able to identify the optimal number of circuit layers for a given instance to maximize success probability. Furthermore, we demonstrate the impact of different noise sources on the performance of QAOA, and reveal the coherent error caused by the residual ZZ-coupling between qubits as a dominant source of error in a near-term superconducting quantum processor.},

@article{Robert2021,
	abstract = {Predicting the three-dimensional structure of a protein from its primary sequence of amino acids is known as the protein folding problem. Due to the central role of proteins'structures in chemistry, biology and medicine applications, this subject has been intensively studied for over half a century. Although classical algorithms provide practical solutions for the sampling of the conformation space of small proteins, they cannot tackle the intrinsic NP-hard complexity of the problem, even when reduced to the simplest Hydrophobic-Polar model. On the other hand, while fault-tolerant quantum computers are beyond reach for state-of-the-art quantum technologies, there is evidence that quantum algorithms can be successfully used in noisy state-of-the-art quantum computers to accelerate energy optimization in frustrated systems. In this work, we present a model Hamiltonian with {\$}{\$}{\{}{$\backslash$}mathcal{\{}O{\}}{\}}({\{}N{\}}\^{}{\{}4{\}}){\$}{\$}scaling and a corresponding quantum variational algorithm for the folding of a polymer chain with N monomers on a lattice. The model reflects many physico-chemical properties of the protein, reducing the gap between coarse-grained representations and mere lattice models. In addition, we use a robust and versatile optimization scheme, bringing together variational quantum algorithms specifically adapted to classical cost functions and evolutionary strategies to simulate the folding of the 10 amino acid Angiotensin on 22 qubits. The same method is also successfully applied to the study of the folding of a 7 amino acid neuropeptide using 9 qubits on an IBM 20-qubit quantum computer. Bringing together recent advances in building gate-based quantum computers with noise-tolerant hybrid quantum-classical algorithms, this work paves the way towards accessible and relevant scientific experiments on real quantum processors.},

abstract = {Optimization problems is one of the most challenging applications of quantum computers, as well as one of the most relevants. As a consequence, it has attracted huge efforts to obtain a speedup over classical algorithms using quantum resources. Up to now, many problems of different nature have been addressed through the perspective of this revolutionary computation paradigm, but there are still many open questions. In this work, a hybrid classical-quantum approach is presented for dealing with the one-dimensional Bin Packing Problem (1dBPP). The algorithm comprises two modules, each one designed for being executed in different computational ecosystems. First, a quantum subroutine seeks a set of feasible bin configurations of the problem at hand. Secondly, a classical computation subroutine builds complete solutions to the problem from the subsets given by the quantum subroutine. Being a hybrid solver, we have called our method H-BPP. To test our algorithm, we have built 18 different 1dBPP instances as a benchmarking set, in which we analyse the fitness, the number of solutions and the performance of the QC subroutine. Based on these figures of merit we verify that H-BPP is a valid technique to address the 1dBPP.},

	abstract = {The method of simulated annealing, to be referred to---after Szu (1986)---as classical simulated annealing (CSA), received much attention recently, especially for solving combinatorial problems (e.g., in the VLSI area), implementing the Boltzman machine for learning in neural networks, and recently for global function optimization. In Szu (1986a, 1987) the fast simulating annealing (FSA) algorithm was introduced---using the Cauchy rather than Gaussian sampling and fast cooling---and applied to finding the global minimum of a nonconvex multiextremal function. It has proved to be superior to the CSA technique. Recently, the method of stochastic approximation combined with convolution smoothing (to be referred to as SAS) was successfully used by Styblinski and Opalski (1984) for manufacturing yield optimization with deterministic parameters and non-differentiable p.d.f's (Tang & Styblinski, 1988). In this presentation, some analogies between the CSA/FSA and SAS algorithms are discussed in application to global function minimization.

@article{a12020034,
	abstract = {The next few years will be exciting as prototype universal quantum processors emerge, enabling the implementation of a wider variety of algorithms. Of particular interest are quantum heuristics, which require experimentation on quantum hardware for their evaluation and which have the potential to significantly expand the breadth of applications for which quantum computers have an established advantage. A leading candidate is Farhi et al.&rsquo;s quantum approximate optimization algorithm, which alternates between applying a cost function based Hamiltonian and a mixing Hamiltonian. Here, we extend this framework to allow alternation between more general families of operators. The essence of this extension, the quantum alternating operator ansatz, is the consideration of general parameterized families of unitaries rather than only those corresponding to the time evolution under a fixed local Hamiltonian for a time specified by the parameter. This ansatz supports the representation of a larger, and potentially more useful, set of states than the original formulation, with potential long-term impact on a broad array of application areas. For cases that call for mixing only within a desired subspace, refocusing on unitaries rather than Hamiltonians enables more efficiently implementable mixers than was possible in the original framework. Such mixers are particularly useful for optimization problems with hard constraints that must always be satisfied, defining a feasible subspace, and soft constraints whose violation we wish to minimize. More efficient implementation enables earlier experimental exploration of an alternating operator approach, in the spirit of the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, to a wide variety of approximate optimization, exact optimization, and sampling problems. In addition to introducing the quantum alternating operator ansatz, we lay out design criteria for mixing operators, detail mappings for eight problems, and provide a compendium with brief descriptions of mappings for a diverse array of problems.},

@article{Herrman2022,
	abstract = {The quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) generates an approximate solution to combinatorial optimization problems using a variational ansatz circuit defined by parameterized layers of quantum evolution. In theory, the approximation improves with increasing ansatz depth but gate noise and circuit complexity undermine performance in practice. Here, we investigate a multi-angle ansatz for QAOA that reduces circuit depth and improves the approximation ratio by increasing the number of classical parameters. Even though the number of parameters increases, our results indicate that good parameters can be found in polynomial time for a test dataset we consider. This new ansatz gives a 33{\%} increase in the approximation ratio for an infinite family of MaxCut instances over QAOA. The optimal performance is lower bounded by the conventional ansatz, and we present empirical results for graphs on eight vertices that one layer of the multi-angle anstaz is comparable to three layers of the traditional ansatz on MaxCut problems. Similarly, multi-angle QAOA yields a higher approximation ratio than QAOA at the same depth on a collection of MaxCut instances on fifty and one-hundred vertex graphs. Many of the optimized parameters are found to be zero, so their associated gates can be removed from the circuit, further decreasing the circuit depth. These results indicate that multi-angle QAOA requires shallower circuits to solve problems than QAOA, making it more viable for near-term intermediate-scale quantum devices.},

Present-day photonic quantum computers3--7 have been limited either to non-deterministic operation, low photon numbers and rates, or fixed random gate sequences. Here we introduce a full-stack hardware−software system for executing many-photon quantum circuit operations using integrated nanophotonics: a programmable chip, operating at room temperature and interfaced with a fully automated control system. The system enables remote users to execute quantum algorithms that require up to eight modes of strongly squeezed vacuum initialized as two-mode squeezed states in single temporal modes, a fully general and programmable four-mode interferometer, and photon number-resolving readout on all outputs. Detection of multi-photon events with photon numbers and rates exceeding any previous programmable quantum optical demonstration is made possible by strong squeezing and high sampling rates. We verify the non-classicality of the device output, and use the platform to carry out proof-of-principle demonstrations of three quantum algorithms: Gaussian boson sampling, molecular vibronic spectra and graph similarity8. These demonstrations validate the platform as a launchpad for scaling photonic technologies for quantum information processing.},

@article{10.1063/1.4976737,
	abstract = {{ This is a short overview explaining how building a large-scale, silicon-photonic quantum computer has been reduced to the creation of good sources of 3-photon entangled states (and may simplify further). Given such sources, each photon needs to pass through a small, constant, number of components, interfering with at most 2 other spatially nearby photons, and current photonics engineering has already demonstrated the manufacture of thousands of components on two-dimensional semiconductor chips with performance that, once scaled up, allows the creation of tens of thousands of photons entangled in a state universal for quantum computation. At present the fully integrated, silicon-photonic architecture we envisage involves creating the required entangled states by starting with single-photons produced non-deterministically by pumping silicon waveguides (or cavities) combined with on-chip filters and nanowire superconducting detectors to herald that a photon has been produced. These sources are multiplexed into being near-deterministic, and the single photons then passed through an interferometer to non-deterministically produce small entangled states---necessarily multiplexed to near-determinism again. This is followed by a ``ballistic'' scattering of the small-scale entangled photons through an interferometer such that some photons are detected, leaving the remainder in a large-scale entangled state which is provably universal for quantum computing implemented by single-photon measurements. There are a large number of questions regarding the optimum ways to make and use the final cluster state, dealing with static imperfections, constructing the initial entangled photon sources and so on, that need to be investigated before we can aim for millions of qubits capable of billions of computational time steps. The focus in this article is on the theoretical side of such questions. }},

One element that is required for many of these applications is a high-efficiency photon detector capable of photon-number discrimination. We present an integrated photonic system in the telecom band at 1550 nm based on UV-written silica-on-silicon waveguides and modified transition-edge sensors capable of number resolution and over 40 \% efficiency. Exploiting the mode transmission failure of these devices, we multiplex three detectors in series to demonstrate a combined 79 \% {\textpm} 2 \% detection efficiency with a single pass, and 88 \% {\textpm} 3 \% at the operating wavelength of an on-chip terminal reflection grating. Furthermore, our optical measurements clearly demonstrate no significant unexplained loss in this system due to scattering or reflections.

abstract = {Integrated photonic neural networks provide a promising platform for energy-efficient, high-throughput machine learning with extensive scientific and commercial applications. Photonic neural networks efficiently transform optically encoded inputs using Mach-Zehnder interferometer mesh networks interleaved with nonlinearities. We experimentally trained a three-layer, four-port silicon photonic neural network with programmable phase shifters and optical power monitoring to solve classification tasks using “in situ backpropagation,” a photonic analog of the most popular method to train conventional neural networks. We measured backpropagated gradients for phase-shifter voltages by interfering forward- and backward-propagating light and simulated in situ backpropagation for 64-port photonic neural networks trained on MNIST image recognition given errors. All experiments performed comparably to digital simulations (\&gt;94\% test accuracy), and energy scaling analysis indicated a route to scalable machine learning. Commercial applications of machine learning (ML) are associated with exponentially increasing energy costs, requiring the development of energy-efficient analog alternatives. Many conventional ML methods use digital backpropagation for neural network training, which is a computationally expensive task. Pai et al. designed a photonic neural network chip to allow efficient and feasible in situ backpropagation training by monitoring optical power passing either forward or backward through each waveguide segment of the chip (see the Perspective by Roques-Carmes). The presented proof-of-principle experimental realization of on-chip backpropagation training demonstrates one of the ways that ML could fundamentally change in the future, with most of the computation taking place optically. —Yury Suleymanov Nanophotonic neural networks can be trained using on-chip backpropagation, unlocking opportunities for analog computing.}}

But a nearby Hamiltonian exists for which the transition amplitudes between any eigenstates of the original Hamiltonian are exactly zero for all values of slowness. The general theory is illustrated by spins driven by changing magnetic fields, and implies that any spin expectation history, including those where the spin never precesses, can be generated by infinitely many driving fields, here displayed explicitly. Asymptotically, the absence of transitions is explained by continuation to complex time, where the complex degeneracies in the transitionless driving fields have a nongeneric structure for which there is no Stokes phenomenon; this is analogous to the explanation of reflectionless potentials.},

Such driving in principle allows one to realize arbitrarily fast annealing protocols or implement fast dissipationless driving, circumventing standard adiabatic limitations requiring infinitesimally slow rates. These ideas were tested and used both experimentally and theoretically in small systems, but in larger chaotic systems, it is known that exact counterdiabatic protocols do not exist. In this work, we develop a simple variational approach allowing one to find the best possible counterdiabatic protocols given physical constraints, like locality. These protocols are easy to derive and implement both experimentally and numerically. We show that, using these approximate protocols, one can drastically suppress heating and increase fidelity of quantum annealing protocols in complex many-particle systems. In the fast limit, these protocols provide an effective dual description of adiabatic dynamics, where the coupling constant plays the role of time and the counterdiabatic term plays the role of the Hamiltonian.}}

Each iteration forms linear approximations to the objective and constraint functions by interpolation at the vertices of a simplex and a trust region bound restricts each change to the variables. Thus a new vector of variables is calculated, which may replace one of the current vertices, either to improve the shape of the simplex or because it is the best vector that has been found so far, according to a merit function that gives attention to the greatest constraint violation. The trust region radius $\rho$ is never increased, and it is reduced when the approximations of a well-conditioned simplex fail to yield an improvement to the variables, until $\rho$ reaches a prescribed value that controls the final accuracy. Some convergence properties and several numerical results are given, but there are no more than 9 variables in these calculations because linear approximations can be highly inefficient. Nevertheless, the algorithm is easy to use for small numbers of variables.},

    abstract = { Using counterdiabatic (CD) driving—aiming at suppression of diabatic transition—in digitized adiabatic evolution has garnered immense interest in quantum protocols and algorithms. However, improving the approximate CD terms with a nested commutator ansatz is a challenging task. In this work, we propose a technique of finding optimal coefficients of the CD terms using a variational quantum circuit. By classical optimization routines, the parameters of this circuit are optimized to provide the coefficients corresponding to the CD terms. Then their improved performance is exemplified in Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger state preparation on the nearest-neighbour Ising model. Finally, we also show the advantage over the usual quantum approximation optimization algorithm, in terms of fidelity with bounded time.

In the more general case of several input and output relations, our method obtains circuits that reproduce the action of a target unitary transformation. We use a continuous-variable quantum neural network as the circuit architecture. The network is composed of several layers of optical gates with variable parameters that are optimized by applying automatic differentiation using the TensorFlow backend of the Strawberry Fields photonic quantum computer simulator. We demonstrate the power and versatility of our methods by learning how to use short-depth circuits to synthesize single photons, Gottesman--Kitaev--Preskill states, NOON states, cubic phase gates, random unitaries, cross-Kerr interactions, as well as several other states and gates. We routinely obtain high fidelities above 99% using short-depth circuits, typically consisting of a few hundred gates. The circuits are obtained automatically by simply specifying the target state or gate and running the optimization algorithm.},

@article{Grimsley2019,
	abstract = {Quantum simulation of chemical systems is one of the most promising near-term applications of quantum computers. The variational quantum eigensolver, a leading algorithm for molecular simulations on quantum hardware, has a serious limitation in that it typically relies on a pre-selected wavefunction ansatz that results in approximate wavefunctions and energies. Here we present an arbitrarily accurate variational algorithm that, instead of fixing an ansatz upfront, grows it systematically one operator at a time in a way dictated by the molecule being simulated. This generates an ansatz with a small number of parameters, leading to shallow-depth circuits. We present numerical simulations, including for a prototypical strongly correlated molecule, which show that our algorithm performs much better than a unitary coupled cluster approach, in terms of both circuit depth and chemical accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of our adaptive algorithm for exact simulations with present-day and near-term quantum hardware.},
