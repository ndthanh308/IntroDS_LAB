  "abstract": "We consider a class of three parameter static and axially symmetric metrics that reduce to the Janis-Newman-Winicour (JNW) and $ γ$-metrics in certain limits of the parameters. We obtain rotating form of the metrics that are asymptotically flat, stationary and axisymmetric. In certain values of the parameters, the solutions represent the rotating JNW metric, rotating $ γ$-metric and Bogush-Gal'tsov (BG) metric. The singularities of rotating metrics are investigated. Using the light-ring method, we obtain the quasi normal modes (QNMs) related to rotating metrics in the eikonal limit. Finally, we investigate the precession frequency of a test gyroscope in the presence of the rotating metrics.",
