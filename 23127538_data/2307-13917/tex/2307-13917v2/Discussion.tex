\section{Discussion}

In this work, we propose \ModelName, a novel, scalable Bayesian causal discovery framework that employs SG-MCMC (and VI) to infer causal models. We establish the validity of performing Bayesian inference in the augmented $(\mW,\vp)$ space and demonstrate its connection to permutation-based DAG learning. Furthermore, we provide two instantiations of the proposed framework that offers direct DAG sampling and model-agnosticism to linear and nonlinear relations. We demonstrate superior inference accuracy and scalability on various datasets. Future work can address some limitations: (1) designing better variational networks $\mu_\phi$ to capture the complex distributions of $\mW$ compared to the simple independent Bernoulli distribution; (2) improving the performance of SG-MCMC with continuous relaxation (\cref{appsec: joint inference SG-MCMC}), which currently does not align with its theoretical advantages compared to the SG-MCMC+VI counterpart.% and (3) more evaluations of the uncertainty quantification in high dimensions can be conducted via downstream tasks like Bayesian experimental design.
