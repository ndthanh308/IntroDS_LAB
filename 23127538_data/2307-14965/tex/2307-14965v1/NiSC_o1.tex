\begin{abstract}
The newly discovered high-temperature superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure has attracted a great deal of
interests.
The essential ingredient characterizing the electronic properties is the bilayer NiO$_2$ planes, in which the two layers couple with each other from the bonding of Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ orbital through the intermediate oxygen-atoms.
In the strong coupling limit, an intralayer antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interaction $J_{\parallel}$ between $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals and an interlayer one $J_{\perp}$ between $3d_{z^2}$ orbitals are generated.
Taking into account the Hund's rule at each site and integrating out the $3d_{z^2}$ spin of freedom, the system reduces to a single-orbital bilayer $t$-$J$ model of the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$.
Based on the slave-boson approach, the self-consistent equation for the hopping and pairing order parameters is solved.
Near the relevant $\frac{1}{4}$-filling regime (doping $\delta=0.3\sim 0.5$), the inter-layer coupling $J_{\perp}$ tunes the conventional single-layer $d$-wave superconducting state to the $s$-wave one.
A strong $J_{\perp}$ could enhance the intra-layer superconducting order, leading to a dramatically increased $T_c$.
Interestingly, there could exist a finite regime in which an $s+id$ state emerges.

{\bf Introduction:} Since the discovery of the high-temperature superconductivity (SC) in  cuprates \cite{bednorz1986LBCO,anderson1987rvb}, understanding the pairing mechanism of unconventional SC \cite{anderson1987rvb,kotliar1988,lee2006htsc,keimer2015highTc,proust2019highTc} and searching for new superconductors with high critical temperature $T_c$ remain long-term
challenges.
It has been widely believed that strong electron correlations drive
the $d$-wave pairing symmetry in
the high-$T_c$ SC \cite{anderson1987rvb,kotliar1988,lee2006htsc}. Under such a understanding, many attempts have been made to search for high-$T_c$ SCs in materials with strong electron correlations,
especially, the 3d-transition metal oxides\cite{anisimov1999nickelate,li2019nickelate,HuLH2019,zhang2020ni,botana2021nickelate,zeng2022nickelate,LuC2022}.
However, no new superconductors family with $T_c$ above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen was synthesized until the recent discovery of SC with $T_c=80$K in the La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (LNO) under a pressure of over $14$GPa \cite{Wang2023LNO}, which has attracted many experimental \cite{WenHH2023,Wang2023LNOb} and theoretical attentions \cite{YaoDX2023,Dagotto2023,WangQH2023,Kuroki2023,HuJP2023,ZhangGM2023DMRG,WuWei2023charge,Werner2023,YangF2023}.


%Nickelate superconductor is another prototype of the strongly correlated system which shows unconventional superconductivity \cite{li2019nickelate,zhang2020ni}.
Similarly to cuprates, the LNO hosts a layered structure \cite{Wang2023LNO,Wang2023LNOb,WenHH2023} with each unit cell containing two conducting NiO$_2$ layers, which is isostructure with the CuO$_2$ layer in cuprates.
Calculations based on density-functional-theory (DFT)  \cite{pardo2011dft,Wang2023LNO} suggest that the low-energy degrees of freedom near the Fermi level are of the Ni-3$d$ orbitals, including two $E_g$ orbitals, {\it i.e.},
$3d_{z^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$, with the site energy of the former lower than that of the latter.
Four $E_g$ orbitals in two Ni$^{2.5+}$ cations within a unit cell share three electrons in total.
The $3d_{z^2}$ orbitals in two layers within a unit cell  couple via the hybridization with the O-$2p$ orbitals
in the intercalated LaO layer.
Under pressure, such a Ni-O-Ni bonding angle along the $c$-axis changes from 168$^\circ$ to 180$^\circ$.
This largely enhances the effective interlayer coupling, under which the high-$T_c$ SC emerges \cite{Wang2023LNO}.
It implies that the interlayer coupling is crucial for the high-$T_c$ SC in the LNO\cite{YangF2023}.

The $3d$-orbital character of the low-energy degrees of freedom in the LNO suggests that electron correlation in this material is strong.
Such a point of view is supported by a recent experiment\cite{WenHH2023}
which has revealed that the LNO system is near the boundary of the Mott transition.
Therefore, the strong-coupling picture should be legitimate towards
the pairing mechanism therein.
It has been proposed in Ref.~\cite{ZhangGM2023DMRG, WuWei2023charge} that the interlayer coupling between the two Ni-$3d_{z^2}$ orbitals along the rung
within a unit cell would induce antiferromagnetic (AFM) super exchange interactions. %between them.
The same viewpoint is adopted here.
However, an important ingredient has been missed in these studies, i.e.
the Hund's rule coupling between the $3d_{z^2}$ and the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals within the same Ni$^{2.5+}$ cations, whose effect will be considered in the present study.

In this Letter, strongly-correlated models are built to study the pairing symmetries and pairing nature of LNO under pressure.
We start from the fact that, three electrons within each unit cell
would first fill in the two $3d_{z^2}$ orbitals, which would finally
be half filled due to the strong Hubbard repulsion.
Hence we are left with two half-filled $3d_{z^2}$ orbitals and two quarter-filled $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals in each unit cell.
The two half-filled $3d_{z^2}$ orbitals in a unit cell can be viewed as two insulating spins which couple via the interlayer AFM superexchange interaction \cite{ZhangGM2023DMRG,WuWei2023charge}, while the two quarter-filled $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals take the role of charge carrier.
Under Hund's rule coupling, the AFM interlayer super-exchange interaction
between two $3d_{z^2}$ orbitals %can be delivered to
is transmitted to that between two $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals within a unit cell.
In combination with the intralayer super-exchange interaction, we arrive at a bilayer $t$-$J$ model for the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ degree of freedom, which is responsible for the SC in LNO.
Within the slave-boson mean-field (SBMF) theory \cite{kotliar1988,lee2006htsc}, this model is solved to obtain the ground-state phase diagram and the superconducting $T_c$.
Our result suggests that in the doping regime relevant to the experiment, the interlayer AFM super-exchange interaction $J_{\perp}$ could drive the original single-layer $d$-wave pairing into a mixed $s+id$-wave pairing with
time-reversal-symmetry breaking (TRSB), or, even pure $s$-wave pairing at
strong enough $J_{\perp}$.
Adopting realistic parameters obtained from DFT calculations\cite{Wang2023LNO,YaoDX2023}, our results reveal that
$T_c$ is dramatically enhanced by the interlayer AFM coupling relative to
that for the single-layered case, which may well explain the origin of
the high $T_c$ SC observed in LNO under pressure\cite{Wang2023LNO}.



{\bf Model:}
On average the electron numbers in each $3d_{z^2}$ orbital and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital are 1 and 0.5, respectively, corresponding to half-filling and $1/4$ filling respectively.
Due to Hund's rule, the electrons in $3d_{z^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals
on ths same Ni site tend to form a spin-triplet state.
The $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital lies within the NiO$_2$ and its interlayer hopping $t_{\perp}$ nearly vanishes.
The two layers couple with each other through the electron hopping of $3d_{z^2}$ orbital, inter-mediated by the $2p$ orbital of inter O-atom.
The hopping strength could be enhanced under pressure \cite{YangF2023}.
In the strong coupling limit, superexchange mechanism induces an effective interlayer AFM spin-exchange $J_{\perp}$ between the two $3d_{z^2}$ electrons \cite{ZhangGM2023DMRG,WuWei2023charge}.
Electronic properties are characterized by a two $E_g$-orbitals bilayer
$t-J$ model, as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:LatticeExchange}(a).
Here, each layer is formed by a conventional $t$-$J$ model of $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons, with an intralayer hopping $t$ and an AFM spin-exchange $J_{\parallel}$.
The strong coupling bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model is given by, $H=H_{\parallel} +H_{\perp}$, where ,
\begin{align}
&H_{\parallel}
=-t \sum_{\langle \bm{i},\bm{j} \rangle,\alpha,\sigma}
\big( {c}^{\dagger}_{\bm{i}\alpha\sigma}{c}_{\bm{j}\alpha\sigma}+\text{h.c.} \big)
+J_{\parallel} \sum_{\langle \bm{i},\bm{j} \rangle,\alpha} \bm{S}_{\bm{i}\alpha}\cdot\bm{S}_{\bm{j}\alpha}    \notag\\
& H_{\perp}=-J_H \sum_{\bm{i},\alpha}
\bm{S}_{\bm{i}\alpha}\cdot \bm{S}_{z^2\bm{i}\alpha}
+J_{\perp} \sum_{\bm{i}} \bm{S}_{z^2\bm{i}1}\cdot \bm{S}_{z^2\bm{i}2}
\end{align}
where $c_{\bm{i}\alpha\sigma}^{\dagger}$ is the creation operator for
the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ hole with spin $\sigma=\uparrow,\downarrow$ at
lattice sites $\bm{i}$ in the layer $\alpha=1,2$.
$\bm{S}_{\bm{i}\alpha}=\frac{1}{2}c_{\bm{i}\alpha\sigma}^{\dagger} [\bm{\sigma}]_{\sigma\sigma^{\prime}}c_{\bm{i}\alpha\sigma^{\prime}}$ is the spin operator for the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, with Pauli matrix $\bm{\sigma}=(\sigma_x,\sigma_y,\sigma_z)$.
The summation $\langle \bm{i}\bm{j}\rangle$ takes over all the nearest-neighboring (NN) bonds.
$J_{\parallel}$ describes the intralayer spin-exchange interaction between the nearest-neighbor $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals.
The single-occupied $3d_{z^2}$ orbital plays a role like a
localized spin $\bm{S}_{z^2\bm{i}\alpha}$ and interacts
between the two layer through the interlayer antiferromagnetic
spin-exchange coupling $J_{\perp}$.
$J_H$ characterizes Hund's coupling between spins of
the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ and $3d_{z^2}$ orbitals.

The two orbital problem can be further simplified into a single $3d_{x^2-y^2}$-orbital one due to Hund's rule, which constitutes a minimal model for the mechanism of SC.
In the semi-classical picture, strong Hund's coupling $J_H$ forces the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ spins $\bm{S}_{\bm{i}\alpha}$ aligning in the directions of $\bm{S}_{z^2\bm{i}\alpha}$.
Integrating out the spin degree of freedom of the $3d_{z^2}$ orbital $\bm{S}_{z^2\bm{i}\alpha}$ based on the spin-coherent-state path integral \cite{auerbach1998}, an effective interlayer spin-exchange between $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ electrons (as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:LatticeExchange}(b), see Appendices A and B
in the Supplement Materials for details).
The spin exchange interaction $\bm{S}_{z^21}\cdot\bm{S}_{z^22}$ is equivalent to the spin exchange interaction $\bm{S}_{1}\cdot\bm{S}_{2}$ when acting on the restricted physical Hilbert space.
The remaining theory is a bilayer single $3d_{x^2-y^2}$-orbital
$t$-$J$ model with the nearest-neighbor spin exchange.
\begin{align}\label{Hamiltonian_tJ}
&H
=-t \sum_{\langle \bm{i},\bm{j} \rangle,\alpha,\sigma}
\big( {c}^{\dagger}_{\bm{i}\alpha\sigma}{c}_{\bm{j}\alpha\sigma}+\text{h.c.} \big)
+J_{\parallel} \sum_{\langle \bm{i},\bm{j} \rangle,\alpha} \bm{S}_{\bm{i}\alpha}\cdot\bm{S}_{\bm{j}\alpha}
    \notag\\
&-t_{\perp} \sum_{\bm{i}\sigma}
\big( {c}^{\dagger}_{\bm{i}1\sigma}{c}_{\bm{i}2\sigma}+\text{h.c.} \big)
+J_{\perp} \sum_{\bm{i}} \bm{S}_{\bm{i}1}\cdot \bm{S}_{\bm{i}2},
\end{align}
where the interlayer interaction is larger than the intralayer one, $J_{\perp}>J_{\parallel}$.
A small inter-layer hopping $t_{\perp}(\simeq 0.01t-0.05t)$
is added, which splits the Fermi surfaces into the bonding
and anti-bonding ones.
The sign of $t_{\perp}$ corresponds to a gauge convention and can be absorbed into a gauge transform of the fermion operators.

%The Hubbard and $t-J$-like models have been studied for bilayer systems in literature, yielding interesting phase diagrams %\cite{ubbens1994,maly1996,capponi2004,LeeWC2009,maier2011pair,gall2021bilayer}.
%It has been introduced for the copper based materials near the half-filling and small inter-layer coupling $J_{\perp}$ regime %\cite{ubbens1994,kuboki1995,maly1996,zhao2005,medhi2009,zhai2009bilayer,demler2022}, and several possible SC order symmetries have been suggested.
%Nickelate based materials further call for new interest into such kind of models, specially for the existence of two orbitals \cite{HuLH2019,LuC2022}.
%A variant of the bilayer Hubbard model augmented by the strong intra-rung super-exchange has been found free of the quantum Monte-Carlo (QMC) sign problem at any-doping in certain %parameter regimes \cite{capponi2004,MaTX2022}.
%In particular, the evolution from antiferromagnetism to the extended $s$-wave supersuperconductivity upon doping has been investigated by sign-problem free QMC
%simulations \cite{MaTX2022}.

{\bf The ground-state phase diagram:}
We adopt the SBMF theory\cite{kotliar1988,lee2006htsc} to treat with the above bilayer $t$-$J$ model (\ref{Hamiltonian_tJ}) (see Appendix.C for details).
The electron operator is decomposed into $c_{i\alpha\sigma}^{\dagger}=f_{i\alpha\sigma}^{\dagger}b_{i\alpha}$,
where $f_{i\alpha\sigma}^{\dagger}/b_{i\alpha}$ is the creation/annilation operator of spinon/holon.
At the MF level, the spinon and holon degrees of freedom are decoupled.
In the ground state, the holons are Bose-Einstein condensed (BEC), and thus its operator can be simplified as $b_{i\alpha}=\sqrt{\delta}$, where the hole-doping level $\delta$ is defined as twice of the deviation from half filling and is related to the filling fraction $x$ as $\delta=1-2x$.
In the ideal case when the $3d_{z^2}$ band is completely lower than the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band, the filling fraction of the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band and hence of our $t$-$J$ model is $x=0.25$.
However, in realistic materials, considering the dispersion of the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band, the two bands can slightly overlap, under
which the filling fraction slightly above $0.25$ is also possible.
In our calculation, we set $x\in(0.25,0.35)$, corresponding to
$\delta\in(0.3,0.5)$.
Note that for the single-layer $t$-$J$ model, the pairing
strength in such a heavily overdoped region is very weak.


The super-exchange terms in Eq. (\ref{Hamiltonian_tJ}) can be decomposed by the following intra- and inter- layer bonding and pairing order parameters,
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\chi_{\bm{i}\bm{j}}^{(\alpha)}
=&\langle f_{\bm{j}\alpha\uparrow}^{\dagger} f_{\bm{i}\alpha\uparrow}
+f_{\bm{j}\alpha\downarrow}^{\dagger} f_{\bm{i}\alpha\downarrow}\rangle\equiv \chi_{\bm{j}-\bm{i}}^{(\alpha)},   \\
\Delta_{\bm{i}\bm{j}}^{(\alpha)}
=&\langle f_{\bm{j}\alpha\downarrow} f_{\bm{i}\alpha\uparrow}
-f_{\bm{j}\alpha\uparrow} f_{\bm{i}\alpha\downarrow} \rangle
\equiv\Delta_{\bm{j}-\bm{i}}^{(\alpha)},   \\
\chi_{\bm{i},\perp}
=&\langle f_{\bm{i}2\uparrow}^{\dagger} f_{\bm{i}1\uparrow}
+f_{\bm{i}2\downarrow}^{\dagger} f_{\bm{i}1\downarrow}\rangle
\equiv \chi_{z}, \\
\Delta_{\bm{i},\perp}
=&\langle f_{\bm{i}2\downarrow} f_{\bm{i}1\uparrow}
-f_{\bm{i}2\uparrow} f_{\bm{i}1\downarrow} \rangle
\equiv \Delta_{z},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
which are assumed to be site-independent.
The three pairing order parameters are marked in the inset of Fig.~{\ref{fig:0TPhase}}.

The ground-state phase diagram with respect to the filling $x$ and $J_\perp/J_\parallel$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:0TPhase}(a).
Here we have set $J_\parallel=0.4t$.
As $J_\perp$ should be larger than $J_\parallel$, we have set $J_\perp/J_\parallel\in(1,2)$ in the phase diagram. Three different phases exist in Fig.~\ref{fig:0TPhase}(a).
The lower right region (defined as region III) wherein the filling is relatively high and $J_\perp/J_\parallel$ is relatively small is occupied by the $d$-wave pairing.
This region can be continuously connected to the low hole-doped case for the single-layered $t$-$J$ model\cite{kotliar1988}, which can represent the cuprates.
The upper left region wherein the filling is relatively low and $J_\perp/J_\parallel$ is relatively large (defined as region I) is occupied by the $s$-wave pairing.
This region is relevant to LNO.
A variant of the bilayer Hubbard model augmented by a strong
inter-layer super-exchange reaching the order of Hubbard $U$
has been simulated by quantum Monte-Carlo simulation free of
the sign problem, which also shows the extended $s$-wave
pairing \cite{MaTX2022}.
It is interesting to note that the narrow region (defined as region II) sitting in between region I and III is occupied
by the TRSB $s+id$-wave pairing.

To gain more information of the pairing nature, one typical point is taken within each region in Fig.~\ref{fig:0TPhase}(a) to provide the pairing configurations.
At the typical point in region III exhibiting the $d$-wave pairing, $\Delta_z$=0, $\Delta^{(1,2)}_x=-\Delta^{(1,2)}_y=5.1\times 10^{-3}$, schematically shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:0TPhase}(c).
It turns out that the $d$-wave pairing order parameters on the two layers are in phase, and the interlayer pairing vanishes
as it is inconsistent with this symmetry.
%This pairing configuration is schematically shown in %Fig.~\ref{fig:0TPhase}(c).
At the typical point in region I showing the $s$-wave pairing, $\Delta_z=1.1\times 10^{-3}$, $\Delta^{(1,2)}_x=\Delta^{(1,2)}_y=-1.8\times 10^{-4}$, schematically shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:0TPhase}(b).
Consequently, the order parameters in two layers are in phase, and the interlayer pairing dominates the intralayer one.
It is interesting to note that $\Delta_z$ and $\Delta^{(1,2)}_{x,y}$ hold different signs, which can be
thought as the residue of the $d$-wave pairing from the side view. %This pairing configuration is
At the typical point in region II exhibiting the $s+id$-wave pairing, $\Delta_z=2.9\times 10^{-3}$, $\Delta^{(1,2)}_x=\Delta^{(1,2)*}_y=(-1.3+1.1i)\times 10^{-4}$.
This pairing configuration is schematically shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:0TPhase}(d), which can be decomposed as $\Delta_s+i\Delta_d$, wherein the schematic pairing configurations for $\Delta_s$ and  $\Delta_d$ are the same as Fig.~\ref{fig:0TPhase}(b) and (c).
The $s+id$ pairing state in the intermediate regime spontaneously breaks the time-reversal symmetry.
Similar $s+id$ state has been suggested in the much larger filling (or much lower doping) and much smaller $J_{\perp}$ regime\cite{suzumura1988rvb,kuboki1995,zhao2005}.
Such a state could induce non-trivial supercurrent due to
spatial inhomogeneity, which can be experimentally
detected \cite{LeeWC2009}.

%For strong enough $J_{\perp}$, only inter-layer pairing $\Delta_{z}$ survives and the intra-layer pairings are highly suppressed \cite{eder1995}.
{\bf High-T$_c$ SC driven by interlayer coupling}: In the SBMF, the onset of SC requires that the holons condense and the spinons pair.
Therefore, the superconducting $T_c$ is determined by the minimum of $T_{\text{BEC}}$ and $T_{\text{RVB}}$, where $T_{\text{BEC}}$ represents the BEC temperature of the holons and $T_{\text{RVB}}$ indicates the pairing temperature of the spinons.
As the hole-doping level $\delta$ is very large, $T_{\text{BEC}}\gg T_{\text{RVB}}$\cite{kotliar1988}, and hence $T_c=T_{\text{RVB}}$, which can be obtained by solving the finite-temperature MF self-consistent gap equation.
The obtained $T_c$ as a function of the filling $x$ is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:JperpTcFilling} for three different interlayer super-exchange strengths $J_{\perp}$.
In LNO, the interlayer hopping integral of the $d_{z^2}$ orbital is about 0.635 eV and the intralayer nearest-neighbor bond integral of the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ is about 0.48 eV\cite{YaoDX2023}, then $J_{\perp}/J_{\parallel}\approx (0.635/0.48)^2\approx 1.75$, if the difference between the Hubbard $U$'s of the two orbitals is neglected.
The cases of $J_{\perp}/J_{\parallel}=0$ and $1.5$ are also
calculated for comparison.

Two obvious features are present in Fig.~\ref{fig:JperpTcFilling}. Firstly, the $T_c$ rises promptly with the enhancement of $x$ near $x=0.25$ for whatever $J_{\perp}/J_{\parallel}$.
This feature is similar with the case of $J_\perp=0$ representing the single-layer $t$-$J$ model, wherein $T_c$ drops promptly when the hole-doping $\delta$ approaches $\delta=0.5$.
Secondly, the increase of $J_{\perp}/J_{\parallel}$ enhances $T_c$ drastically.
Near $x=0.25$, the $T_c$ at $J_{\perp}/J_{\parallel}=1.75$ is more than an order of magnitude higher than that at $J_{\perp}=0$.
These results are consistent with two important experiment facts. Firstly, the LNO is not superconducting in the ambient pressure while high-$T_c$ SC emerges upon the pressure, as the pressure enhances the interlayer coupling, and, hence $J_{\perp}$ drastically.
Secondly, the apical-oxygen vacancies suppress the SC promptly.
In our theory, this is because these vacancies would break the Ni-O-Ni bonding along the z-axis, and hence $J_{\perp}$ vanishes locally, which is harmful for SC.
Our results further indicate that properly electron doping into
LNO will effectively enhance its $T_c$.

The pairing symmetry for $J_{\perp}/J_{\parallel}=1.5$ and $1.75$ near $x=0.25$ is $s$-wave, consistent with Fig.~\ref{fig:0TPhase} ($a$).
The corresponding pairing configuration is shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:0TPhase} ($b$), wherein we have $\Delta_x\approx 0$. Therefore, for these realistic interaction parameters in LNO, the pairing state is the interlayer $s$-wave pairing.
The physical reason for $\Delta_z\gg \Delta_x$ is as follows:
Taking any lattice site on, say the top layer, the electron on
this site is trying to select a partner on its neighboring sites
to pair with.
If it selects the intralayer pairing, it has to choose one among the four NN sites around it to pair.
For the $s$-wave pairing, the pairing strength on the four NN bonds should be equal. Therefore, the electron possesses less opportunity to participate in a given NN bond. However, if it selects the interlayer pairing, it can concentrate on the pairing with the electrons at the same site on the bottom layer. Without such ``pairing frustration'', it is no wonder that the interlayer pairing overwhelms the intralayer one.  Such interlayer pairing mechanism not only dictates $\Delta_z\gg\Delta_x$, but also enhances $\Delta_z$ and hence $T_c$ very much due to reduced ``pairing fluctuation''.

%The interlayer pairing makes the LNO quite different from other layered superconductors including the cuprates \cite{ubbens1994,cooper1994anisotropy}. For example, in the aspect of magnetic response, due to the interlayer pairing, ........................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................................


Besides the interlayer pairing mechanism, the two-orbital character is also crucial for the high-Tc of LNO. Suppose we try to realize the bilayer t-J model studied here by a single-orbital bilayer material. While the intralayer hopping integral $t_{\parallel}$ induces the intralayer $J_{\parallel}$, the interlayer hopping integral $t_{\perp}$ induces the interlayer $J_{\perp}$, and we have $J_{\perp}/J_{\parallel}\approx (t_{\perp}/t_{\parallel})^2$\cite{nazarenko1996bilayer3d}. To mimics such a material, we tune $t_{\perp}$ accordingly, and re-investigate the problem. Consequently, the obtained $T_c$ is even lower than that of the single-layered case. The reason lies in that the strong interlayer hopping would ``frustrate'' the pairing on the same bond. It's ingenious in LNO that although the conducting $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals provide very weak interlayer hopping integral $t_{\perp}$ and thus cannot gain strong $J_{\perp}$ directly, it can acquire strong effective $J_{\perp}$ transmitted from the $d_{z^2}$ orbital via the Hund's rule coupling. Therefore, the Hund's-rule-coupled two-orbital character is crucial to realize the high-Tc SC in LNO.


%In multilayer cuprates, an effective large interlayer $J_{\perp}$ is induced from AFM correlation near half-filling \cite{ubbens1994}.

%When strong $J_{\perp}$ is applied, the inter-layer superconducting pairing $\Delta_{z}$ dominates the intra-layer pairing.The transition temperature is dramatically increased ($J_{\perp}/J_{\parallel}=1.75$)  compared to the single-layer ($J_{\perp}/J_{\parallel}=0$) case.The stabilization of SC state from inter-layer coupling has been explored in several multi-orbital Hubbard or $t$-$J$ models \cite{ubbens1994,kuboki1995,maly1996,zhao2005,medhi2009,zhai2009bilayer,demler2022,MaTX2022}.

{\bf Discussion and Conclusion:} Different from the cuprates, there is no pseudo gap phase for the realistic parameters of LNO, as the doping level $\delta\approx 0.5$ locates well within the heavily overdoped region, in which $T_{\text{BEC}}\gg T_{\text{RVB}}$. However, from the aspect of model study, if we further enhance $J_{\perp}$, the situation would be fundamentally change. For strong enough $J_{\perp}$, the interlayer pairing gap would overwhelm the intralayer hopping energy. In such cases, an electron from the top layer would tightly pair with another electron from the bottom layer at the same site to form a local Boson at a very high temperature $T^*$, which will then experience a BEC at a lower temperature $T_c$ to form the SC. This is the BEC limit. In this limit, the phase between $T^*$ and $T_c$ is the pseudo gap phase.  For intermediate $J_{\perp}$, the system will experience the BEC-BCS crossover, wherein the $T_c\approx T^*$ arrives at its maximum. Such interesting physics might be realized through further enhancing the pressure.



An interesting possibility of LNO is the charge-4e SC. This originates from the $U(1)\times U(1)$ gauge symmetry for vanishing $t_{\perp}$. If we tune the doping so that the system locates within the d-wave pairing phase, the phase difference between the top and bottom layer is determined by the sign of the vanishing $t_{\perp}$, which will strongly fluctuate at finite temperature. It's possible that above the pairing $T_c$, while the relative phase difference between the two layers is not locked, their total phase is locked, leading to the charge-4e SC. Such exotic SC can be detected by half magnetic flux quantization.


In conclusion, we have derived an effective bilayer $t-J$ model to describe the charge carriers on the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals with filling fraction near $\frac{1}{4}$, which are responsible for the SC in LNO under pressure. Although the motion of the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$- charge carries is mainly limited within the monolayer, they gain interlayer superexchange interaction transmitted from the $3d_{z^2}$-orbitals via the Hund's rule coupling. Based on the SBFM theory, we obtained the ground-state pairing phase diagram, which includes the interlayer s-wave, the intralayer d-wave and the TRSB s+id-wave pairings in different parameter regions. For the realistic parameters of LNO, the interlayer s-wave pairing is more likely. In comparison with the single-layered t-J model in this doping region, the interlayer superexchange not only changes the pairing symmetry, but also drastically enhances the $T_c$, which explains the observed high-$T_c$ SC in the LNO under pressure.

\section*{Appendix A. Effective inter-layer $3d_{x^2-y^2}$-orbital spin-exchange interaction}
In the bilayer system,
the two layers interact with each other through the hopping of $3d_{z^2}$ orbital inter-mediated by the O-$2p$ orbitals between the two layers.
In the strong coupling limit, an effective antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin-exchange $J_{\perp}$ between the two $3d_{z^2}$ electrons is induced\cite{ZhangGM2023DMRG,WuWei2023charge}.
For simplicity, we can focus on a pair of nearest-neighbor sites, $1$ and $2$, lying at the two layers.
The spin Hamiltonian of the four spins at the two sites $i=1,2$ for the two orbitals $3d_{x^2-y^2}$, $3d_{z^2}$ are described by,
\begin{align*}
&\hat{H}_{12}= -J_H \bm{S}_{z^2,1}\cdot\bm{S}_{x^2,1}
-J_H \bm{S}_{z^2,2}\cdot\bm{S}_{x^2,2}
+J_{\perp} \bm{S}_{z^2,1}\cdot\bm{S}_{z^2,2},
\end{align*}
with the Hund's coupling $J_H$ and interlayer spin exchange $J_{\perp}$.
In the following, we will obtain the effective interlayer spin-exchange between two nearest-neighbor $3d_{z^2-y^2}$ orbitals at the two layers.
%,as depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:Exponents}.

%------------------------------------------------

In the spin-coherent state path integral,
we treat $\bm{S}_{z^2,1}$ and $\bm{S}_{z^2,2}$ as the basic field variables and try to integrate out them to obtain an effective spin interaction between $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals.
The partition function of the spin system is given by \cite{auerbach1998},
\begin{align*}
Z=& \mathrm{Tr}T_{\tau} \Big( \exp\big[ -\int_0^{\beta}d\tau \hat{H}(\tau) \big] \Big)
=\int \mathcal{D} \hat{\Omega} \exp\big( -\tilde{S}[\hat{\Omega}] \big),
\end{align*}
where $\bm{S}_{x^2,i}\rightarrow S\hat{\Omega}_i$ ($i=1,2$) and the spin action in the imaginary time is
\begin{align*}
\tilde{S}[\hat{\Omega}]
=&\tilde{S}_0[\hat{\Omega}]
+\tilde{S}_{\perp}[\hat{\Omega}]
+\tilde{S}_{H}[\hat{\Omega}],\qquad
\tilde{S}_{\perp}[\hat{\Omega}]
=S^2 J_{\perp} \int_0^{\beta} d\tau \hat{\Omega}_1\cdot\hat{\Omega}_2,	\\
\tilde{S}_{\omega}[\hat{\Omega}]=&-iS \omega[\hat{\Omega}_1] -iS \omega[\hat{\Omega}_2]
=iS \sum_{i=1,2} \int_0^{\beta} d\tau (\partial_{\tau}\phi_i) \cos\theta_i,	\\
\tilde{S}_H[\hat{\Omega}]=& \int_0^{\beta} d\tau \Big(
-SJ_H \bm{S}_{x^2,1} \cdot \hat{\Omega}_1
-SJ_H\bm{S}_{x^2,2} \cdot \hat{\Omega}_2 \Big).
\end{align*}
Here $\tilde{S}_{\omega}$ is the Berry phase contribution, $\tilde{S}_{\perp}$ is the interlayer spin exchange coupling in the $3d_{z^2}$ orbitals and $\tilde{S}_H$ is the Hund's coupling.
The paramaterization of the unit vectors are given by
\begin{align*}
\hat{\Omega}_1 =&\big( \sin\theta_1\cos\phi_1, \sin\theta_1 \sin \phi_1, \cos\theta_1 \big),	\\
\hat{\Omega}_2 =&\big( \sin\theta_2\cos\phi_2, \sin\theta_2 \sin \phi_2, \cos\theta_2 \big),
\end{align*}
with boundary conditions,
\begin{align*}
\hat{\Omega}_i(\beta)=\hat{\Omega}_i(0):\qquad
\theta_i(\beta)=\theta_i(0),\qquad
\phi_i(\beta)=\phi_i(0).
\end{align*}


In the strong coupling $J_H$ limit where $J_H\gg J_{\perp}$, $\tilde{S}_{\perp}$ term can be considered as a perturbation and the partition function $Z$ can be expanded in order of $J_{\perp}$,
\begin{align*}
Z=&\int \mathcal{D} \hat{\Omega} \exp\big( -\tilde{S}[\hat{\Omega}] \big)
=\int \mathcal{D} \hat{\Omega}
\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{n!} \big( -\tilde{S}_{\perp}[\hat{\Omega}] \big)^n
\exp\big( -\tilde{S}_{\omega}[\hat{\Omega}] -\tilde{S}_{H}[\hat{\Omega}] \big) 	\\
=&\Big\langle 1- \tilde{S}_{\perp}[\hat{\Omega}]
+\big(\tilde{S}_{\perp}[\hat{\Omega}]\big)^2 +\cdots \Big\rangle_{H}
\end{align*}
where the integral of $\hat{\Omega}$ is defined as,
\begin{align*}
\big\langle \big( \cdots \big) \big\rangle_{H}
=\int \mathcal{D} \hat{\Omega} \big( \cdots \big)
\exp\big( -\tilde{S}_{\omega}[\hat{\Omega}] -\tilde{S}_{H}[\hat{\Omega}] \big).
\end{align*}
Here, the two integrals for the $\hat{\Omega}_1$ and $\hat{\Omega}_2$ are independent in the perturbative expansion since they are decoupling in the action $\tilde{S}_{\omega}+\tilde{S}_H$.
In the $J_H\gg 0$ limit,
the spin configurations $(\hat{\Omega}_1,\hat{\Omega}_2)$  are nearly in the directions of $(\bm{S}_{x^2,1},\bm{S}_{x^2,2})$.
Thus, the average of the spin variable is just given by,
\begin{align*}
\langle \hat{\Omega}_1(\tau) \rangle = \hat{\bm{S}}_{x^2,1},\qquad
\langle \hat{\Omega}_2(\tau) \rangle = \hat{\bm{S}}_{x^2,2}
\end{align*}
where $\hat{\bm{S}}_i$ is the unit spin vector, $\hat{\bm{S}}_i=\bm{S}_i/S$.
In this sense, we can have
\begin{align*}
&\Big\langle \Big(S^2 J_{\perp} \int_0^{\beta} d\tau \hat{\Omega}_1\cdot\hat{\Omega}_2\Big)^n \Big\rangle_H
=\Big\langle \Big(S^2 J_{\perp} \int_0^{\beta} d\tau \hat{\bm{S}}_{x^2,1}\cdot\hat{\bm{S}}_{x^2,2}\Big)^n \Big\rangle_H
=\Big\langle \Big(J_{\perp} \int_0^{\beta} d\tau {\bm{S}}_{x^2,1}\cdot{\bm{S}}_{x^2,2}\Big)^n \Big\rangle_H
\end{align*}
that is, we can replace the averaged spin $\hat{\Omega}_i$ by $\bm{S}_{x^2,i}$.
The partition function becomes,
\begin{align*}
Z=\Big\langle 1- \tilde{S}_{\perp}[\hat{\Omega}]
+\big(\tilde{S}_{\perp}[\hat{\Omega}]\big)^2 +\cdots \Big\rangle_{H}
=\Big\langle 1- \tilde{S}_{\perp}[\hat{\bm{S}}_{x^2}]
+\big(\tilde{S}_{\perp}[\hat{\bm{S}}_{x^2}]\big)^2 +\cdots \Big\rangle_{H}
=\exp\Big(-\tilde{S}_{\perp}[\hat{\bm{S}}_{x^2}]\Big),
\end{align*}
with an effective AFM spin-exchange interaction between $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals,
\begin{align*}
\tilde{S}_{\perp}[\hat{\bm{S}}_{x^2}]
=J_{\perp} \int_0^{\beta} d\tau {\bm{S}}_{x^2,1}\cdot{\bm{S}}_{x^2,2}.
\end{align*}
Based on these argument, the two orbital model reduces to a single $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital model.





\section*{Appendix B. Operator method under Hund's rule}
In this section, we consider direct operator method to obtain the equivalence between the exhancge operators $\bm{S}_{x^2,1}\cdot\bm{S}_{x^2,2}$ and $\bm{S}_{z^2,1}\cdot\bm{S}_{z^2,2}$.
As before, consider a pair of nearest-neighbor sites, $1$ and $2$, lying at the two layer.
There are totally four spins and the Hilbert space has $2^4=16$ states.
Impose the Hund's rule for $3d_{z^2}$ and $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals described by the Hund's couplings,
\begin{align*}
\hat{H}_{\text{Hund}} =
-J_H \bm{S}_{z^2,1}\cdot \bm{S}_{x^2,1}
-J_H \bm{S}_{z^2,2}\cdot \bm{S}_{x^2,2},
\end{align*}
the two spins at a single site should form spin-triplet states with total spin-$1$.
The physical states of the Hilbert space reduce to the followings $9=3\times 3$ states under the Hund's rule,
\begin{align*}
\begin{cases}
|+1\rangle_1=\displaystyle\big| \underset{d_{z^2}}{\uparrow},\ \underset{d_{x^2}}{\uparrow}\big\rangle_{1}	\\
\\
|0\rangle_1=\displaystyle\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\Big(\big| \underset{d_{z^2}}{\uparrow},\ \underset{d_{x^2}}{\downarrow}\big\rangle_{1}
+\big| \underset{d_{z^2}}{\downarrow},\ \underset{d_{x^2}}{\uparrow}\big\rangle_{1}
\Big)	\\
\\
|-1\rangle_1=\displaystyle\big| \underset{d_{z^2}}{\downarrow},\ \underset{d_{x^2}}{\downarrow}\big\rangle_{1}
\end{cases}
%%%%%%%
\otimes
%%%%%%%
\begin{cases}
|+1\rangle_2=\displaystyle\big| \underset{d_{z^2}}{\uparrow},\ \underset{d_{x^2}}{\uparrow}\big\rangle_{2}	\\
\\
|0\rangle_2=\displaystyle\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\Big(\big| \underset{d_{z^2}}{\uparrow},\ \underset{d_{x^2}}{\downarrow}\big\rangle_{2}
+\big| \underset{d_{z^2}}{\downarrow},\ \underset{d_{x^2}}{\uparrow}\big\rangle_{2}
\Big)	\\
\\
|-1\rangle_2=\displaystyle\big| \underset{d_{z^2}}{\downarrow},\ \underset{d_{x^2}}{\downarrow}\big\rangle_{2}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}
where $|\sigma_{z^2},\sigma_{x^2}\rangle_i$ represents the spin configuration of the two $E_g$-orbitals in the site $i$.
These $9$ states are eigenstates of total spin-$1$ operator at each site,
\begin{align*}
\bm{S}_1=\bm{S}_{x^2,1}+\bm{S}_{z^2,1},\qquad
\bm{S}_2=\bm{S}_{x^2,2}+\bm{S}_{z^2,2},\qquad
S_1=S_1=1,
\end{align*}
and their energies under Hund's coupling are degenerate,
\begin{align*}
\hat{H}_{\text{Hund}}
=&-\frac{J_H}{2} \Big[ \big(\bm{S}_{z^2,1}+\bm{S}_{x^2,1}\big)^2
-\frac{3}{2}\Big]
-\frac{J_H}{2} \Big[ \big(\bm{S}_{z^2,2}+\bm{S}_{x^2,2}\big)^2
-\frac{3}{2}\Big],	\\
E_{\text{Hund}}
=&-\frac{J_H}{2} \Big(1\times 2 -\frac{3}{2}\Big)\cdot 2
=-\frac{J_H}{2},
\end{align*}
The $9$ combinations of two spin-triplet (spin-$1$) states can form total spin $J=0,1,2$ states,
\begin{align*}
\bm{J}=\bm{S}_1+\bm{S}_2
=\bm{S}_{x^2,1}+\bm{S}_{z^2,1}
+\bm{S}_{x^2,2}+\bm{S}_{z^2,2},\qquad
J=0,1,2.
\end{align*}
For total spin-$2$, there are five states,
\begin{align*}
|\underset{J}{2},\underset{M}{+2}\rangle =&|+1\rangle_1 |+1\rangle_2
=|\uparrow\uparrow\rangle_1 |\uparrow\uparrow\rangle_2	\\
|\underset{J}{2},\underset{M}{+1}\rangle
=&\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\Big(|+1\rangle_1 |0\rangle_2 +|0\rangle_1 |+1\rangle_2\Big)
=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\Big(|\uparrow\uparrow\rangle_1 |0\rangle_2 +|0\rangle_1 |\uparrow\uparrow\rangle_2\Big)	\\
|\underset{J}{2},\underset{M}{0}\rangle
=&\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\Big(|+1\rangle_1 |-1\rangle_2
+2|0\rangle_1 |0\rangle +|-1\rangle_1 |+1\rangle_2\Big)	\\
=&\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}\Big(|\uparrow\uparrow\rangle_1 |\downarrow\downarrow\rangle_2
+2|0\rangle_1 |0\rangle_2 +|\downarrow\downarrow\rangle_1 |\uparrow\uparrow\rangle_2\Big)	\\
|\underset{J}{2},\underset{M}{-1}\rangle
=&\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\Big(|-1\rangle_1 |0\rangle_2 +|0\rangle_1 |-1\rangle_2\Big)
=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\Big(|\downarrow\downarrow\rangle_1 |0\rangle_2 +|0\rangle_1 |\downarrow\downarrow\rangle_2\Big)		\\
|\underset{J}{2},\underset{M}{-2}\rangle =&|-1\rangle_1 |-1\rangle_2
=|\downarrow\downarrow\rangle_1 |\downarrow\downarrow\rangle_2
\end{align*}
For total spin-$1$, there is three states,
\begin{align*}
|\underset{J}{1},\underset{M}{+1}\rangle
=&\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\Big(|+1\rangle_1 |0\rangle -|0\rangle_1 |+1\rangle_2\Big)
=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\Big(|\uparrow\uparrow\rangle_1 |0\rangle -|0\rangle_1 |\uparrow\uparrow\rangle_2\Big)	\\
|\underset{J}{1},\underset{M}{0}\rangle
=&\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\Big(|+1\rangle_1 |-1\rangle
-|-1\rangle_1 |+1\rangle_2\Big)
=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\Big(|\uparrow\uparrow\rangle_1 |\downarrow\downarrow\rangle -|\downarrow\downarrow\rangle_1 |\uparrow\uparrow\rangle_2\Big)	\\
|\underset{J}{1},\underset{M}{-1}\rangle
=&\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\Big(|-1\rangle_1 |0\rangle -|0\rangle_1 |-1\rangle_2\Big)
=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\Big(|\downarrow\downarrow\rangle_1 |0\rangle -|0\rangle_1 |\downarrow\downarrow\rangle_2\Big)
\end{align*}
For total spin-$0$, there is only one state,
\begin{align*}
|\underset{J}{0},\underset{M}{0}\rangle =&\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\Big(
|+1\rangle_1 |-1\rangle_2
-|0\rangle_1 |0\rangle
+|-1\rangle_1 |+1\rangle_2\Big)		\\
=&\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \big(|\uparrow\uparrow\rangle_1|\downarrow\downarrow\rangle_2
-|0\rangle_1 |0\rangle_2
+|\downarrow\downarrow\rangle_1|\uparrow\uparrow\rangle_2\big).
\end{align*}
These $9$ states are symmetric under exchanging the spin of two orbitals at each site.


Next, we consider the action of the following spin-exchange operators on these $9$ states,
\begin{align*}
\hat{H}_{z^2}
=& \bm{S}_{z^2,1}\cdot\bm{S}_{z^2,2}
= {S}_{z^2,1}^{z}{S}_{z^2,2}^{z}
+ \frac{1}{2} \Big({S}_{z^2,1}^+{S}_{z^2,2}^-
+{S}_{z^2,1}^-{S}_{z^2,2}^+\Big),	\\
\hat{H}_{x^2}
=&\bm{S}_{x^2,1}\cdot\bm{S}_{x^2,2},\qquad
\hat{H}_{x^2,z^2}
=\bm{S}_{x^2,1}\cdot\bm{S}_{z^2,2},\qquad
\hat{H}_{z^2,x^2}
=\bm{S}_{z^2,1}\cdot\bm{S}_{x^2,2}
\end{align*}
A direct calculation leads to the result for the five total spin-$2$ states,
\begin{align*}
\hat{H}_{z^2}|J={2},M\rangle
=\frac{1}{4} |J={2},M\rangle,
\end{align*}
that is, these five states $|2,M\rangle$ ($M=\pm 2,\pm 1,0$) are eigenstates of $\hat{H}_{z^2}$.
Next, consider the three total spin-$1$ states.
A straightforward calculation gives the following results,
\begin{align*}
\Big( \hat{H}_{z^2}
+\frac{1}{4} \Big)|\underset{J}{1},\underset{M}{+1}\rangle
=&\frac{1}{4} \frac{1}{2}\Big(2\sqrt{2}|\uparrow\uparrow\rangle_1|s\rangle_2
-2\sqrt{2}|s\rangle_1 |\uparrow\uparrow\rangle_2 \Big), \\
\Big( \hat{H}_{z^2}
+\frac{1}{4} \Big)|\underset{J}{1},\underset{M}{0}\rangle
=&\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}
\Big(-|s\rangle_1|0\rangle_2 +|0\rangle_1|s\rangle_2\Big)
\end{align*}
where $|s\rangle_i$ ($i=1,2$) are spin-singlet configuration at the site $i$.
The total spin-$1$ states are not the exact eigenstates of $\hat{H}_{z^2}$.
However, when restricted to the physical Hilbert space under the Hund's rule with only spin-triplet states at site $i$,
the total spin-$1$ states are approximately eigenstates,
\begin{align*}
\hat{H}_{z^2}|J=1,{M}\rangle
+\frac{1}{4}|J=1,{M}\rangle  \sim 0,\qquad
\hat{H}_{z^2}|J=1,{M}\rangle
\simeq \frac{1}{4}|J=1,{M}\rangle
\end{align*}
Finally, consider the total spin-$0$ case, direct calculation gives the relation
\begin{align*}
&\Big(\hat{H}_{z^2}+\frac{1}{2}\Big)|0,0\rangle
=\frac{1}{4} \frac{3}{2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}
\big(|\uparrow\downarrow\rangle_1 -|\downarrow\uparrow\rangle_1\big)
\big( |\uparrow\downarrow\rangle_2
-|\downarrow\uparrow\rangle_2\big)
=\frac{\sqrt{3}}{4} |s\rangle_1 |s\rangle_2,
\end{align*}
which leaves out the physical Hilbert spcae under the Hund's rule.
Thus, for the total spin-$0$, we can have
\begin{align*}
\hat{H}_{z^2}|0,0\rangle
\simeq -\frac{1}{2}|0,0\rangle.
\end{align*}

In summary, for the $9$ states under the Hund's rule, they are also the eigenstates of $\hat{H}_{z^2}$ under the restricted physical Hilbert space.
Moreover, since these $9$ states are symmetric in the $z^2$ and $x^2$ orbital, this argument is also true for $\hat{H}_{x^2}$.
Actually, for the four spin-exchange combinations,
\begin{align*}
\hat{H}_{z^2}
=& \bm{S}_{z^2,1}\cdot\bm{S}_{z^2,2},\qquad
\hat{H}_{x^2}
=\bm{S}_{x^2,1}\cdot\bm{S}_{x^2,2},\qquad
\hat{H}_{x^2,z^2}
=\bm{S}_{x^2,1}\cdot\bm{S}_{z^2,2},\qquad
\hat{H}_{z^2,x^2}
=\bm{S}_{z^2,1}\cdot\bm{S}_{x^2,2}
\end{align*}
the $9$ states are eigenstates in the physical Hilbert space under Hunds's rule, as shown in Tab.~(\ref{tab:SpinExchangeHunds}).

\section*{Appendix C. Slave-boson mean-field approach}
\label{SLPapproach}
In this appendix, we provide the explicit details of the slave particle approach \cite{kotliar1988,lee2006htsc}.
The Hamiltonian of the single-orbital bilayer $t-J$ model is given by \cite{ubbens1994},
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
&H= -t \sum_{\langle \bm{i},\bm{j} \rangle,\alpha,\sigma}
\left( {c}^{\dagger}_{\bm{i}\alpha\sigma}{c}_{\bm{j}\alpha\sigma}+\text{h.c.} \right)
+J_{\parallel} \sum_{\langle \bm{i},\bm{j} \rangle,\alpha} \bm{S}_{i,\alpha}\cdot\bm{S}_{j,\alpha}
+J_{\perp} \sum_{\bm{i}} \bm{S}_{\bm{i},1}\cdot\bm{S}_{\bm{j},2}.
\end{aligned}

In the slave-boson mean field theory, the electron operator is expressed as $c_{\bm{i}\alpha\sigma}^{\dagger}=f_{\bm{i}\alpha\sigma}^{\dagger}b_{\bm{i}\alpha}$, where $f_{\bm{i}\alpha\sigma}$ is the spinon operator and $b_{\bm{i}\alpha}$ is the holon operator.
The forbidden of double occupied electron states is introduced through the local constraint $\sum_{\sigma}f_{\bm{i}\alpha\sigma}^{\dagger} f_{\bm{i}\alpha\sigma} +b_{\bm{i}\alpha}^{\dagger} b_{\bm{i}\alpha} =1$.
Introduce the intralayer spinon hoppings and pairings and the interlayer ones \cite{kotliar1988,lee2006htsc},
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\chi_{\bm{i}\bm{j}}^{(\alpha)}
=&f_{\bm{j}\alpha\uparrow}^{\dagger} f_{\bm{i}\alpha\uparrow}
+f_{\bm{j}\alpha\downarrow}^{\dagger} f_{\bm{i}\alpha\downarrow},\qquad
\Delta_{\bm{i}\bm{j}}^{(\alpha)}
=f_{\bm{j}\alpha\downarrow} f_{\bm{i}\alpha\uparrow }
-f_{\bm{j}\alpha\uparrow} f_{\bm{i}\alpha\downarrow },   \\
\chi_{\bm{i},\perp}
=&f_{\bm{i}2\uparrow}^{\dagger} f_{\bm{i}1\uparrow}
+f_{\bm{i}2\downarrow}^{\dagger} f_{\bm{i}1\downarrow},\qquad
\Delta_{\bm{i},\perp}
=f_{\bm{i}2\downarrow } f_{\bm{i}1\uparrow}
-f_{\bm{i}2\uparrow} f_{\bm{i}1\downarrow},
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
the Hamiltonian can be decoupled in the form,
\begin{align*}
H=&-t \sum_{\langle \bm{i},\bm{j} \rangle,\alpha}
\Big( {b}_{\bm{i}\alpha} b^{\dagger}_{\bm{j}\alpha}
\sum_{\sigma} {f}^{\dagger}_{\bm{i}\alpha\sigma} {f}_{\bm{j}\alpha\sigma} +\text{h.c.} \Big)
+\sum_{\bm{i}\alpha} \lambda_{\bm{i}\alpha}\big(\sum_{\sigma}f_{\bm{i}\alpha\sigma}^{\dagger} f_{\bm{i}\alpha\sigma} +b_{\bm{i}\alpha}^{\dagger} b_{\bm{i}\alpha}-1\big)  \\
&-\frac{3J_{\parallel}}{8} \sum_{\langle \bm{i},\bm{j} \rangle,\alpha} \Big[ \chi_{\bm{i}\bm{j}}^{(\alpha)}

&-\frac{3J_{\parallel}}{8} \sum_{\langle \bm{i},\bm{j} \rangle,\alpha} \Big[ \Delta_{\bm{i}\bm{j}}^{(\alpha)}
\big(f_{\bm{i}\alpha\uparrow}^{\dagger}f_{\bm{j}\alpha\downarrow}^{\dagger}
-f_{\bm{i}\alpha\downarrow}^{\dagger}f_{\bm{j}\alpha\uparrow}^{\dagger} \big) +\text{h.c.} -|\Delta_{\bm{i}\bm{j}}^{(\alpha)}|^2  \Big]   \\
&-\frac{3J_{\perp}}{8} \sum_{\bm{i}} \Big[ \chi_{\bm{i},\perp}

&-\frac{3J_{\perp}}{8} \sum_{\bm{i}} \Big[ \Delta_{\bm{i},\perp}

-f_{\bm{i}1\downarrow}^{\dagger}f_{\bm{i}2\uparrow}^{\dagger} \big) +\text{h.c.} -|\Delta_{\bm{i},\perp}|^2  \Big]
\end{align*}
The decoupling Hamiltonian is invariant under the $U(1)\times U(1)$ gauge transformation,
\begin{align*}
f_{\bm{i}\alpha}^{\dagger} \rightarrow e^{i\theta_{\bm{i}\alpha}} f_{\bm{i}\alpha}^{\dagger},\qquad
&\chi_{\bm{i}\bm{j}}^{(\alpha)} \rightarrow
e^{-i(\theta_{\bm{i}\alpha}-\theta_{\bm{j}\alpha})} \chi_{\bm{i}\bm{j}}^{(\alpha)},\qquad
\Delta_{\bm{i}\bm{j}}^{(\alpha)} \rightarrow
e^{-i(\theta_{\bm{i}\alpha}+\theta_{\bm{j} \alpha})} \Delta_{\bm{i}\bm{j}}^{(\alpha)}   \\
f_{\bm{i}\alpha}\rightarrow e^{-i\theta_{\bm{i}\alpha}} f_{\bm{i}\alpha},\qquad
&\chi_{\bm{i},\perp} \rightarrow
e^{-i(\theta_{\bm{i}1}-\theta_{\bm{j}2})} \chi_{\bm{i},\perp},\qquad
\Delta_{\bm{i},\perp} \rightarrow
e^{-i(\theta_{\bm{i}1}+\theta_{\bm{j}2})} \Delta_{\bm{i},\perp}
\end{align*}


In the mean-field analysis, hopping $\chi$s, pairing $\Delta$s and Lagrange multipliers $\lambda_{\bm{i}\alpha}$ are represented by their site-independent mean-field value,
\begin{align*}
\chi_{\bm{i}\bm{j}}^{(\alpha)} = \chi_{\bm{j}-\bm{i}}^{(\alpha)},\qquad
\chi_{\bm{i},\perp} = \chi_{z},\qquad
\Delta_{\bm{i}\bm{j}}^{(\alpha)} = \Delta_{\bm{j}-\bm{i}}^{(\alpha)},\qquad
\Delta_{\bm{i},\perp} = \Delta_{z},\qquad
\lambda_{\bm{i}\alpha}=\lambda
\end{align*}
The holon is condensed $\langle b^{\dagger}_{\bm{j}\alpha} {b}_{\bm{i}\alpha}\rangle =\delta$.
The mean-field Hamiltonian for the spionon part is given by,
\begin{align*}
&H_{f,\textbf{MF}}=\sum_{\bm{k}\alpha\sigma} \varepsilon_{\bm{k},\alpha} f_{\bm{k}\alpha\sigma}^{\dagger} f_{\bm{k}\alpha\sigma}
-\frac{3}{8} J \sum_{\bm{k}}
\Big[\chi_{z} \big(f_{\bm{k}1\uparrow}^{\dagger} f_{\bm{k}2\uparrow}
+f_{-\bm{k}1\downarrow}^{\dagger} f_{-\bm{k}2\downarrow} \big)+\text{h.c.} \Big]
\\
&+\sum_{\bm{k}\alpha} \big(F_{\bm{k},\alpha} f_{\bm{k}\alpha\uparrow}^{\dagger} f_{-\bm{k}\alpha\downarrow}^{\dagger} +\text{h.c.} \big)
-\frac{3}{8} J \sum_{\bm{k}}
\Delta_{z} \Big[ \big(f_{\bm{k}1\uparrow}^{\dagger} f_{-\bm{k}2\downarrow}^{\dagger}
-f_{-\bm{k}1\downarrow}^{\dagger} f_{\bm{k}2\uparrow}^{\dagger} \big) +\text{h.c.} \Big] \\
&- \frac{3}{8} J_{\parallel} N \sum_{\alpha} \big(|\chi_{x}^{(\alpha)}|^2 +|\chi_{y}^{(\alpha)}|^2
+|\Delta_{x}^{(\alpha)}|^2 +|\Delta_{y}^{(\alpha)}|^2 \big)
+\frac{3}{8} J_{\perp} N \big(|\chi_{\perp}|^2 +|\Delta_{\perp}|^2 \big)
\end{align*}
where the intralayer kinectic energy and pairing energy are,
\begin{align*}
\varepsilon_{\bm{k},\alpha} =& -\frac{3}{8} J_{\parallel} \big[\chi_{x}^{(\alpha)} e^{-ik_x}
+\chi_{y}^{(\alpha)} e^{-ik_y} +\text{h.c.}\big]
-2t\delta \big[ \cos k_x +\cos k_y \big]  -\mu_f,    \\
F_{\bm{k},\alpha} =& -\frac{3}{4} J_{\parallel} \big[\Delta_{x}^{(\alpha)} \cos(k_x) +\Delta_{y}^{(\alpha)} \cos(k_y) \big]
\end{align*}
and $\mu_f$ is the chemical potential of the spinon field.
Introduce the Nambu spinor,
\begin{align*}
\psi_{\bm{k}}^{\dagger}
=\begin{pmatrix}
f_{\bm{k}1\uparrow}^{\dagger} &
f_{\bm{k}2\uparrow}^{\dagger} &
f_{-\bm{k}1\downarrow} &
f_{-\bm{k}2\downarrow}
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
the mean-field Hamiltonian can be further written in the matrix form,
\begin{align*}
&H_{f,\text{MF}}
=\sum_{\bm{k}}
\psi_{\bm{k}}^{\dagger}
\begin{pmatrix}
\varepsilon_{\bm{k},1} & -\displaystyle \frac{3}{8} J\chi_{z} & F_{\bm{k},1} & \displaystyle -\frac{3}{8} J\Delta_{z} \\
%%%%-------------------------
-\displaystyle \frac{3}{8} J\chi_{z}^* & \varepsilon_{\bm{k},2} & \displaystyle -\frac{3}{8} J\Delta_{z} & F_{\bm{k},2} \\
%%%%-------------------------
F_{\bm{k},1}^* & \displaystyle -\frac{3}{8} J\Delta_{z}^* & -\varepsilon_{-\bm{k},1} & \displaystyle \frac{3}{8} J\chi_{z}^* \\
%%%%-------------------------
\displaystyle -\frac{3}{8} J\Delta_{z}^* & F_{\bm{k},2}^* & \displaystyle \frac{3}{8} J\chi_{z} & -\varepsilon_{-\bm{k},2}
\end{pmatrix}
\psi_{\bm{k}}
+\underbrace{\sum_{\bm{k}\alpha} \varepsilon_{-\bm{k},\alpha}}_{-2N\mu_f}     \\
&+ \frac{3}{8} J_{\parallel} N \sum_{\alpha} \big(|\chi_{x}^{(\alpha)}|^2 +|\chi_{y}^{(\alpha)}|^2
+|\Delta_{x}^{(\alpha)}|^2 +|\Delta_{y}^{(\alpha)}|^2 \big)
+\frac{3}{8} J_{\perp} N \big(|\chi_{z}|^2 +|\Delta_{z}|^2 \big)
\end{align*}




The quadratic term in the mean-field Hamiltonian can be diagonalized through a unitary transformation,
\begin{align*}
H_{f,\text{MF}}
=\sum_{\bm{k}} \psi_{\bm{k}}^{\dagger} H_{\bm{k}} \psi_{\bm{k}} +\cdots
=\sum_{\bm{k}} \gamma_{\bm{k}}^{\dagger} E_{\bm{k}} \gamma_{\bm{k}} +\cdots
\end{align*}
where $E_{\bm{k}}=\mathrm{diag}(E_{1\bm{k}},E_{2\bm{k}},E_{3\bm{k}},E_{4\bm{k}})$ is the eigenvalue matrix for $H_{\bm{k}}$ given by
\begin{align*}
H_{\bm{k}} (y_{1\bm{k}},y_{2\bm{k}},y_{3\bm{k}},y_{4\bm{k}})
=(y_{1\bm{k}},y_{2\bm{k}},y_{3\bm{k}},y_{4\bm{k}})
\begin{pmatrix}
E_{1\bm{k}} & & & \\
& E_{2\bm{k}} & & \\
& & E_{3\bm{k}} & \\
& & & E_{4\bm{k}}
\end{pmatrix}
\equiv U_{\bm{k}} E_{\bm{k}}
\end{align*}
and the quasiparticle creation is defined as $\gamma_{\bm{k}}^{\dagger}=(\gamma_{1\bm{k}}^{\dagger},\gamma_{2\bm{k}}^{\dagger},\gamma_{3\bm{k}}^{\dagger},\gamma_{4\bm{k}}^{\dagger})$.
The unitary transformation $U_{\bm{k}}$ diagonalize the mean-field Hamiltonian$H_{\bm{k}}$,
\begin{align*}
H_{\bm{k}} =U_{\bm{k}} E_{\bm{k}} U_{\bm{k}}^{\dagger},\qquad
E_{\bm{k}} =U_{\bm{k}}^{\dagger} H_{\bm{k}} U_{\bm{k}},\qquad
\psi_{\bm{k}}=U_{\bm{k}} \gamma_{\bm{k}},\qquad
\gamma_{\bm{k}}=U_{\bm{k}}^{\dagger} \psi_{\bm{k}}.
\end{align*}


\paragraph{Free energy}
The partition function of mean-field theory is given by
\begin{align*}
Z= \mathrm{Tr} \exp\Big( -\beta H_{f,\text{MF}} \Big)
=e^{\text{const}.} \mathrm{Tr} \exp\Big( -\beta \sum_{\bm{{k}},a} E_{a\bm{k}} \gamma_{a\bm{k}}^{\dagger} \gamma_{a\bm{k}} \Big)
=e^{\text{const}.} \mathrm{Tr} \prod_{\bm{k},a} \exp\Big( -\beta E_{a\bm{k}} \gamma_{a\bm{k}}^{\dagger} \gamma_{a\bm{k}} \Big)
\end{align*}
where the trace over the fermionic Hilbert space can be calculated out explicitly,
\begin{align*}
\mathrm{Tr} \exp\Big( -\beta E_{a\bm{k}} \gamma_{a\bm{k}}^{\dagger} \gamma_{a\bm{k}} \Big)
=1+ e^{-\beta E_{a\bm{k}}}.
\end{align*}
The free energy is deduced from the partition function directly,
\begin{align*}F=&-\frac{1}{\beta} \ln Z=-\frac{1}{\beta} \sum_{\bm{k},a} \ln\Big( 1+ e^{-\beta E_{a\bm{k}}} \Big)-2\mu_f N	\\
& + \frac{3}{8} J_{\parallel} N \sum_{\alpha} \big(|\chi_{x}^{(\alpha)}|^2 +|\chi_{y}^{(\alpha)}|^2
+|\Delta_{x}^{(\alpha)}|^2 +|\Delta_{y}^{(\alpha)}|^2 \big)
+\frac{3}{8} J_{\perp} N \big(|\chi_{\perp}|^2 +|\Delta_{\perp}|^2 \big)
\end{align*}
In the BdG system with particle-hole symmetry,
the quasiparticle spectrum can be arranged in the way
\begin{align*}
E_{1\bm{k}}=E_{1,\bm{k}}^{(+)}>0,\qquad
E_{2\bm{k}}=E_{2,\bm{k}}^{(+)}>0,\qquad
E_{3\bm{k}}=-E_{1,-\bm{k}}^{(+)}<0,\qquad
E_{4\bm{k}}=-E_{2,-\bm{k}}^{(+)}<0.
\end{align*}
and the free energy can be written in a compatible form,
\begin{align*}F=&
-\frac{2}{\beta} \sum_{\bm{k},a=1,2} \ln\Big( 1+e^{-\beta E_{a\bm{k}}^{(+)}}\Big)
-\sum_{\bm{k},a=1,2} E_{a\bm{k}}^{(+)} -2\mu_f N	\\
& + \frac{3}{8} J_{\parallel} N \sum_{\alpha} \big(|\chi_{x}^{(\alpha)}|^2 +|\chi_{y}^{(\alpha)}|^2
+|\Delta_{x}^{(\alpha)}|^2 +|\Delta_{y}^{(\alpha)}|^2 \big)
+\frac{3}{8} J_{\perp} N \big(|\chi_{z}|^2 +|\Delta_{z}|^2 \big)
\end{align*}
In the zero temperature limit, the first term vanishes.
