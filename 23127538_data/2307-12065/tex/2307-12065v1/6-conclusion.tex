\section{Conclusion}

This paper investigated the $(\bm{\alpha}, \bm{\beta})$-proportionally fair normalized cut graph partitioning problem.
We proposed a novel algorithm, FNM, consisting of an extended spectral embedding method and a $k$-means-based rounding scheme to provide a node partitioning with a small Ncut value on a graph while strictly following the proportional fairness constraints.
The comprehensive experimental findings confirmed the superior performance of FNM in terms of partition quality, fairness, and efficiency.
In future work, we will generalize our algorithm to handle other notions of fairness, e.g., individual fairness~\cite{MahabadiV20, gupta2022consistency}, in graph partitioning problems.
