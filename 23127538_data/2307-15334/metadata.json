  "abstract": "For a finite, positive, Borel measure $μ$ on $(0,1)$ we consider an infinite matrix $Γ_μ$, related to the classical Hausdorff matrix defined by the same measure $μ$, in the same algebraic way that the Hilbert matrix is related to the Cesáro matrix. When $μ$ is the Lebesgue measure, $Γ_μ$ reduces to the classical Hilbert matrix. We prove that the matrices $Γ_μ$ are not Hankel, unless $μ$ is a constant multiple of the Lebesgue measure,\n  we give necessary and sufficient conditions for their boundedness on the scale of Hardy spaces $H^p, \\, 1 \\leq p < \\infty$, and we study their compactness and complete continuity properties. In the case $2\\leq p<\\infty$, we are able to compute the exact value of the norm of the operator.",
