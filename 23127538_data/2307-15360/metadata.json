  "abstract": "We show that a qubit transfer protocol can be realized through a flat band hosted by a disordered $XX$ spin-1/2 diamond chain. In the absence of disorder, the transmission becomes impossible due to the compact localized states forming the flat band. When off-diagonal disorder is considered, the degeneracy of the band is preserved but the associated states are no longer confined to the unit cells. By perturbatively coupling the sender and receiver to the flat band, we derive a general effective Hamiltonian resembling a star network model with two hubs. The effective couplings correspond to wavefunctions associated with the flat-band modes. Specific relationships between these parameters define the quality of the quantum-state transfer which, in turn, are related to the degree of localization in the flat band. Our findings establish a framework for further studies of flat bands in the context of quantum communication.",
