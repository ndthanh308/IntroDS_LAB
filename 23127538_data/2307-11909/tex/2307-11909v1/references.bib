abstract = {The depth resolution achieved by a continuous wave time-of-flight (C-ToF) imaging
system is determined by the coding (modulation and demodulation) functions that it
uses. Almost all current C-ToF systems use sinusoid or square coding functions, resulting
in a limited depth resolution. In this article, we present a mathematical framework
for exploring and characterizing the space of C-ToF coding functions in a geometrically
intuitive space. Using this framework, we design families of novel coding functions
that are based on Hamiltonian cycles on hypercube graphs. Given a fixed total source
power and acquisition time, the new Hamiltonian coding scheme can achieve up to an
order of magnitude higher resolution as compared to the current state-of-the-art methods,
especially in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) settings. We also develop a comprehensive
physically-motivated simulator for C-ToF cameras that can be used to evaluate various
coding schemes prior to a real hardware implementation. Since most off-the-shelf C-ToF
sensors use sinusoid or square functions, we develop a hardware prototype that can
implement a wide range of coding functions. Using this prototype and our software
simulator, we demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed Hamiltonian coding
functions in a wide range of imaging settings.},
