  "abstract": "In this paper, we consider the convergence rate with respect to the Wasserstein distance in the invariance principle for sequential dynamical systems. We utilize and modify the techniques previously employed for stationary sequences to address our non-stationary case. Under certain assumptions, we can apply our result to a large class of dynamical systems, including sequential $β_n$-transformations, piecewise uniformly expanding maps with additive noise in one-dimensional and multidimensional case, and so on.",
