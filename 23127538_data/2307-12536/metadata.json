  "abstract": "We study possibilities for algebraic closures, differences between definable and algebraic closures in first-order structures, and variations of these closures with respect to the bounds of cardinalities of definable sets and given sets of formulae. Characteristics for these possibilities and differences are introduced and described. These characteristics are studied for some natural classes of theories. Besides algebraic closure operators with respect to sets of formulae are introduced and studied. Semilattices and lattices for families of these operators are introduced and characteristics of these structures are described.",
