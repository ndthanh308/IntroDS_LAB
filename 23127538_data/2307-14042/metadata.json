  "abstract": "We focus on gravitational-wave events of binary black-hole mergers up to the third observing run with the minimum false alarm rate smaller than $10^{-5}\\,{\\rm yr}^{-1}$. These events tell us that the mass ratio of two black holes follows $m_2/m_1=0.723$ with the chance probability of 0.00301% for the chirp mass $M_{\\rm chirp} > 18\\,M_{\\odot}$. We show that the relation of $m_2/m_1=0.723$ is consistent with the binaries originated from population III stars which are the first stars in the universe. On the other hand, it is found for ${\\rm chirp} < 18 M_{\\odot}$ that the mass ratio follows $m_2/m_1=0.601$ with the chance probability of 0.117% if we ignore GW190412 with $m_2/m_1\\sim 0.32$. This suggests a different origin from that for $M_{\\rm chirp} > 18 M_{\\odot}$.",
