\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}
By fully leveraging the commit message and the code change semantics, we construct a large-scale Python security commit dataset named \db{} that consists of three parts: base, pilot, and augmented datasets. 
To enrich the base dataset extracted from CVE reports, the pilot dataset collects the commits that contain the pre-defined security keywords in their commit messages. 
Given the diversified data samples, we further train \gnn{} to learn the security semantics in the code changes to compensate for the poorly documented commits. 
We conduct a large-scale empirical study of security commits by analyzing \db{} of 119 CWE categories across 351 repositories. 
The summarized patterns can assist further software maintenance, e.g., auto program repair.
% Our summarized pattern can be well-assisted in the auto program repair designs.
In the future, we will adopt large language models to expand the dataset and apply the summarized patterns to fix the vulnerabilities automatically.
