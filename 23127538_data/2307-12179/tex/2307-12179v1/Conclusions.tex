\section{Summary}
We proposed OaSC, a novel approach for the task of zero-shot state classification.  Our model holds the great advantage of being object-agnostic, a property that renders it more robust and generic than other  methods which depend on  object class classification.
We evaluated our approach on three benchmark datasets (\cite{gouidis2022,Mancini2022,Isola2015}).  OaSC outperforms the competing SoA method and shows strong performance in all benchmark datasets. Moreover, an extensive ablation study evaluated several design options and shed light in important aspects of the object state estimation problem.

In terms of future directions, firstly, we aim to experiment with the tuning of the GNN by using a classifier pre-trained on attribute classes or object-attributes pairs instead of object classes. Secondly, we would like to examine whether the exclusive inclusion of nodes related to objects into KGs leads to better results. 
Overall,  we consider that the zero-shot state classification  in the object-agnostic setting is worth further investigation. We hope that our work will encourage future efforts towards this direction.
 %However, implementing this approach is challenging as the available KG sources do not provide a reliable method for measuring the relevance of concepts.
