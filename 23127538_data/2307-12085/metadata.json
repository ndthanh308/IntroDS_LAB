  "abstract": "We study the limiting distribution of dense orbits of a lattice subgroup $Γ\\le \\text{SL}(m+1,\\mathbb{R})$ acting on $H\\backslash\\text{SL}(m+1,\\mathbb{R})$, with respect to a filtration of growing norm balls. The novelty of our work is that the groups $H$ we consider have infinitely many non-trivial connected components. For a specific such $H$, the homogeneous space $H\\backslash G$ identifies with $X_{m,m+1}$, a moduli space of rank $m$-discrete subgroups in $\\mathbb{R}^{m+1}$. This study is motivated by the work of Shapira-Sargent who studied random walks on $X_{2,3}$.",
