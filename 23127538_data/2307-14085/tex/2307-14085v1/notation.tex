{\noindent \bf Notations.}
We denote by $\SSS_+^d$ the class of $d$-dimensional symmetric nonnegative definite matrices, $\cF(\cX)$ the class of measurable functions on space $\cX$,  $[N]=\{1, \dots, N\}$, $\Delta(\cX)$ the probability space on $\cX$, $\Cov[v]$ the covariance matrix for random vector $v$, and $\nbr{\cdot}_P$ the vector norm induced by $P\in\SSS_+^d$. We denote by {$\lesssim$} the inequality relationship up to some constants and logarithmic factors. We denote by $|\cB|$ the size of a class $\cB$.
