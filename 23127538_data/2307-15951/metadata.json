  "abstract": "Previous multilingual text-to-speech (TTS) approaches have considered leveraging monolingual speaker data to enable cross-lingual speech synthesis. However, such data-efficient approaches have ignored synthesizing emotional aspects of speech due to the challenges of cross-speaker cross-lingual emotion transfer - the heavy entanglement of speaker timbre, emotion, and language factors in the speech signal will make a system produce cross-lingual synthetic speech with an undesired foreign accent and weak emotion expressiveness. This paper proposes the Multilingual Emotional TTS (METTS) model to mitigate these problems, realizing both cross-speaker and cross-lingual emotion transfer. Specifically, METTS takes DelightfulTTS as the backbone model and proposes the following designs. First, to alleviate the foreign accent problem, METTS introduces multi-scale emotion modeling to disentangle speech prosody into coarse-grained and fine-grained scales, producing language-agnostic and language-specific emotion representations, respectively. Second, as a pre-processing step, formant shift-based information perturbation is applied to the reference signal for better disentanglement of speaker timbre in the speech. Third, a vector quantization-based emotion matcher is designed for reference selection, leading to decent naturalness and emotion diversity in cross-lingual synthetic speech. Experiments demonstrate the good design of METTS.",
