\section{Binary Artifact}
\label{app:artifact-link}
An anonymous artifact containing the benchmarks and all the tools used in the
evaluation, including our \Nidhugg version with \EventDPOR, is available at
\url{https://drive.google.com/file/d/17BbkGYfqSy-6OsbTWWzhEY5AYr2Bs9wL/view?usp=sharing}.
The SHA256 hash of the file is
\texttt{3a5198802c3396a3ccaecd4dfb7bde4a620a5709d9a87b5d0cb3ace87bad9f39}.

%% Note that the version in the artifact does not implement the \textbf{Witness
%%   Construction} or \textbf{Decision Procedure} steps in \cref{sec:checkwi}, and
%% can misbehave on programs where these steps are required. Also, branches in
%% messages are only supported under some conditions.
