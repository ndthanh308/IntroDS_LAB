\section{Concluding Remarks}
\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper, we presented a novel SMC algorithm, \EventDPOR, tailored to the
characteristics of event-driven multi-threaded programs running under the SC
semantics. The algorithm was proven correct and optimal for event-driven
programs in which the variable accesses of events do not depend on how their
execution is interleaved with other threads.

We have implemented \EventDPOR in the \Nidhugg tool, and we will open-source
our implementation.
%
With a wide range of event-driven programs, we have shown that \EventDPOR
incurs only a moderate constant overhead over its baseline implementation
(\OptimalDPOR), it is exponentially faster than existing state-of-the-art SMC
algorithms in time and number of traces examined on programs where events'
actions do not conflict, and does not suffer from performance degradation
caused by having to examine
% a significant number of
non-serializable executions.
%
%% \bjcom{Should we include:
%% Moreover, in our benchmarks, also those that are not non-branching,
%% \EventDPOR explores only the optimal number of executions, and never
%% had to resort to a potentially expensive decision procedure.}

\EventDPOR assumes that handlers can process their events in arbitrary order.
Directions for future work include to retarget \EventDPOR for event-driven
programs with other policies (e.g., FIFO), and for specific event-driven
execution models.
