CHECKS
#################

1- Need to validate mets with MW GCs. Find a list with reliable mets in the literature and select candidate stars using proper motion.

2- Check if new photometry (2MASS, WISE) is a better fit to isochrones.


#################
PLOT
#################

1- Initial cuts plots. Have a plot with the CMD cut and a map of the resulting distribution of stars. I think it's not necessary to plot the parallax and pm cuts, only explain.

2- Literature vs Gaia XGBoost. GALAH vs XGBoost.

3- Find 2-4 metallicity ranges that show different features in the outskirts of the clouds. Density plot.

4- MDF for the different features in the outskirts.

5- Map of mean density accross the MCs.

6- MDF at different annuli for both galaxies with gaussian smoothing.

7- Metallicity gradients. Done.

1- Introduction

2- Data (Gaia/XGBoost) and MW GC literature values and comparison.

3- Results

4- Discussion:
   - Different mets for different features at the outskirts and possible origins.
   - Metallicity gradients

5- Conclusions
