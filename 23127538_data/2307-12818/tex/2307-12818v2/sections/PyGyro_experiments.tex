\subsection{Conservation Properties}

As we saw in the theoretical part of this paper (sec. !!reference missing!!), the mass, the $l^2$-norm, and the energy should be conserved exactly by the poloidal step if the Arakawa scheme is used for the discretization of the Poisson bracket. We can see in fig.\ref{fig:conservation-properties} that the relative error of these quantities is very well given in the linear phase (until $t=$)

\subsection{Order of Convergence}

In order to find the order of convergence, we run the code multiple times with the same parameters for time but different meshes: A first run is done on a coarse mesh, followed by a run on a mesh with half the grid spacing (in each direction). Then the error between the two in the $l^2$-norm is computed. This procedure is repeated for multiple refinements in the mesh, each time halving the grid spacing and computing the $l^2$-error between the coarse and the finer run. Plotting the errors against the grid spacings yields the curves of fig. \ref{fig:convergence_constadv} and fig. \ref{fig:convergence_vortex}.

The same was done for Dirichlet and period boundary conditions, both for order 2 and 4. A summary can be found in tab. \ref{tab:order-of-convergence}.
