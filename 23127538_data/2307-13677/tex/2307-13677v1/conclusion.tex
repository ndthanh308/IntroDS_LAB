\section{Conclusion} \label{sec:concl}
In this paper, we present Smartpick, a scalable data analytics system that determines optimal
compute resource configurations for given queries by predicting workloads with consideration of
hybrid compute resources, i.e., SL and VM.
Smartpick utilizes decision-tree based Random Forest to predict workloads
and Bayesian Optimizer to efficiently explore the large search space for determining optimal configurations.
Smartpick is mindful of cost-performance tradeoff space opened by exploiting SL and VM together, and incorporates workload dynamics.
Experimental results on AWS and GCP indicate high-precision resource determination for Smartpick with prediction
accuracies of 97.05\% and 83.49\% respectively. The results confirm that Smartpick enables 
applications to achieve their target cost-performance goals, handle workload dynamics automatically, and 
improve performance without additional cost compared to baselines.
The results also show that other data analytics systems can benefit from Smartpick.

%Performance prediction in a rapidly evolving cloud environment is the key to efficient handling of ad-hoc queries in a timely and cost-efficient manner.  Smartpick's workload prediction model coupled with its allied features, such as relay, incorporation of dynamics and alien/new workload on-boarding, provide a reliable and application-agnostic approach to utilize the hybrid pool of VM and SL instances. In addition, the support for cost-performance tradeoff knob enhances the flexibility of Smartpick(-r) and ensures fine tuning of client applications to meet their budgeted requirements. Experiments conducted on live test-beds of AWS \cite{awsRef} and Google Cloud \cite{gcpRef} indicate high-precision resource determination for Smartpick with prediction accuracies of 97.05\% and 83.49\% respectively. Furthermore, it is observed that the proposed model handles alien queries (unknown TPC-DS queries) and new workloads (Word Count application and TPC-H) efficiently through the incorporation of spatial cosine similarity along with the fast convergence to actual values (coarse-grained dynamics). %Simulation results collated against modified state-of-the-art techniques (in order to align with hybrid model of VMs and SLs) - OptimusCloud \cite{optimuscloud} and CherryPick \cite{cherrypick} - show an outstanding performance-cost ratio in \textit{Smartpick(-r)}.

%\textcolor{red}{working on future work}
%As part of our future work, we plan to extend Smartpick-r into Wide Area Network (WAN) so that efficient geo-distributed resource determination is possible for cross-datacenter analytics. In addition, we aim to incorporate other set of diverse instance families and cloud providers, such as Microsoft Azure \cite{azure}, IBM \cite{ibmcloud} and Oracle \cite{oraclecloud}, which will enhance Smartpick-r's usability across a vast cloud community.
