\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
In this paper, we describe the first attempt at a comparative
life-cycle energy and inventory analysis between the AQFP integrated circuits and those of a conventional
CMOS technology. We provide energy and inventory
analysis accounting for the manufacturing, assembly, and use phases. The functional units used in this paper are 32-bit single-core CMOS and AQFP RISC-V processors. Our analysis shows that while the AQFP processor has larger manufacturing and assembly energy, the use phase energy consumed by AQFP circuits is significantly smaller than the CMOS counterpart. As a result, AQFP circuits are 237X more energy efficient in total in comparison with the CMOS counterpart. Even with considering the cooling cost the energy efficiency of the AQFP circuit is 205X. In the near future, downsizing the AQFP chip area can lead to a significant reduction in the manufacturing and assembly energy of the AQFP circuits. Moreover, the overall life cycle of the AQFP circuits can be improved several times over through such downsizing.
