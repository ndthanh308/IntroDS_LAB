  "abstract": "A phase field method self-consistently coupled to continuum heat transport and charge conservation is used to simulate conducting filament dynamical evolution and nanostructure of electroformed resistive switching thin films. Our method does not require a pre-defined idealized conducting filament, as previous methods do, instead treating its dynamical evolution as a stochastic diffuse interface problem subject to a variational principle. Our simulation results agree well with available experimental observations, correctly reproducing electroformed conducting filament nanostructure exhibited by a variety of resistive switching thin films.",
