\section{Conclusion}
We provided lower bounds and matching upper bounds for central tasks in multi-round distributed data analysis: heavy hitters recovery and approximate histograms over large domains. Our findings show how porting single-round approaches based on standard sketching does not achieve optimality, and how this can be cleverly achieved via subsampled IBLTs. Several interesting and non-trivial questions remain to be addressed, including (a) developing distributed differential privacy schemes that are provably optimal for this problem, and (b) developing (non-linear) cryptographic (or other secure) primitives that allow us to extract heavy hitters with smaller (sublinear in $mn$) communication.
