		\textbf{{\LARGE List of Changes for Submission \#1290}}
	\end{center}

	\vspace{.5in}

	\noindent Dear Reviewers, \\

	\noindent We gratefully thank you for your acceptance of our submission entitled \emph{HealthPrism: A Visual Analytics Systems for Exploring Children's Physical and Mental Health Profiles with Multimodal Data} (ID: \emph{1290}). We are very encouraged by the reviews and appreciate your help in improving our paper. The point-to-point responses to the second round reviews are as follow.

\

 \noindent \textbf{Comment R.1: }\textit{All review comments were very adequately addressed. Also, the specific revision to clarify the data collection activities and sources was met, though there is apparently no reference to the data sources or data collection available. Concerning the last point: The authors mention several times in the response document that they acquired IRB approval for the data collection. It would be good to mention this at least once in the paper, or at the very least in the accompanying document where the data collection is described.}
	\vskip 1ex
	\noindent \textbf{Response R.1:} We sincerely thank the reviewers for the careful evaluation, valuable comments, and constructive suggestions, which help improve the manuscript significantly. In previous version, we had not explicitly stated the IRB approval and reference for data collection for anonymization purpose. In the final version, we have added this information in \emph{Section \textcolor{blue}{3.1}}. 

 \noindent \textbf{\emph{Corresponding sentences:}} \emph{\textcolor{blue}{``This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong / Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (IRB number: UW 19-516). Informed written consent was obtained from the parents of the participants. More detailed data collection and processing procedures can be found in \cite{healthinference}.''}}

\

  \noindent \textbf{Comment R.2: }\textit{Second Round Supplementary Materials Comments: The data collection is now addressed in more detail. It should mention the IRB approval explicitly, though.}
	\vskip 1ex
	\noindent \textbf{Response R.2:} In the final version of the supplementary appendices, we have also added the IRB approval information explicitly at the beginning of \emph{Appendix \textcolor{blue}{A}}.

  \noindent \textbf{\emph{Corresponding sentences:}} \emph{\textcolor{blue}{``This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong / Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (IRB number: UW 19-516). Informed written consent was obtained from the parents of the participants.''}}


\

\noindent To summarize, we present main changes that we have made to the final paper in the following:
	
\begin{enumerate}
    \item We have de-anonymized the paper. Specifically, we have exchanged the order of the third and fourth authors to make the author order more accurately reflects the degree of each author's contribution to the paper, since the third author Rui Zhou (used to be the fourth) has contributed greatly in the second-round revision. This decision was made collectively and respectfully, and we assure you that this decision is in full compliance with the guidelines of authorship attribution and contribution.
    \item We have added the IRB approval information and data collection reference in \emph{Section \textcolor{blue}{3.1} Data Description and Pre-processing}. This study was approved by The Institutional Review Board of the University of Hong Kong / Hospital Authority Hong Kong West Cluster (IRB number: UW 19-516). Informed written consent was obtained from the parents of the participants.
    \item We have carefully gone through the manuscript to correct typos, formatting issues, and grammatical errors, and make it fit into the page limits.
    \item We have added the acknowledgment part.
\end{enumerate}
		
Thank you again for reviewing this manuscript. We genuinely appreciate your valuable comments, which significantly contribute to the enhancement of this paper.

\

\noindent Sincerely,

\noindent Zhihan Jiang, Handi Chen, Rui Zhou, Jing Deng, Xinchen Zhang, Running Zhao, Cong Xie, Yifang Wang, Edith C.H. Ngai
