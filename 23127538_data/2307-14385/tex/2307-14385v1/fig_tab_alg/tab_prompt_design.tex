\caption{Prompt Design for Mental Health Recognition Tasks. Prompt Part 1 aims to provide a better specification for LLMs and Part 2 poses the questions for LLMs to answer. For Part 1, we propose three strategies: context enhancement, mental health enhancement, and the combination of both. As for Part 2, we design different content for multiple mental health problem categories and prediction tasks. For each part, we propose two to three versions to improve its variation.}
