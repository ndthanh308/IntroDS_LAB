  "abstract": "We provide a simple analysis based on ray optics and Dirac notation for one and two-dimensional Cosine beams. We then went on to understand the properties of the Bessel beams. For the first time, we report on a generation of three-dimensional needle structures based on interference of one-dimensional Cosine beams. Straightforward mathematical calculations are used to derive the analytical expressions for Cosine beams. The present method of demonstration of Cosine beams may be utilized to understand other structured modes. The Dirac notation-based interference explanation used here can render new researchers to discover an easy way to understand the wave nature of light in fundamental interferometric experiments as well as in advanced-level experiments such as beam engineering technology, imaging, particle manipulation, light sheet microscopy, and light-matter interaction. We also provide an in-depth analysis of similarities among Cosine, Bessel, and Hermite-Gaussian beams.",
