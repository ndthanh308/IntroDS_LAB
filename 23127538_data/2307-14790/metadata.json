  "abstract": "In this research, medical information from 1200 patients across various hospitals in Iraq was collected over a period of 3 years, from February 3, 2018, to March 5, 2021. The study encompassed several infections, including urinary tract infections, wound infections, tonsillitis, prostatitis, endometritis, endometrial lining infections, burns infections, pneumonia, and bloodstream infections in children. Multiple bacterial pathogens were identified, and their resistance to various antibiotics was recorded. The data analysis revealed significant patterns of antibiotic resistance among the identified bacterial pathogens. Resistance was observed to several commonly used antibiotics, highlighting the emerging challenge of antimicrobial resistance in Iraq. These findings underscore the importance of implementing effective antimicrobial stewardship programs and infection control measures in healthcare settings to mitigate the spread of antibiotic-resistant infections and ensure optimal patient outcomes. This study contributes valuable insights into the prevalence and patterns of antibiotic resistance in microbial infections, which can guide healthcare practitioners and policymakers in formulating targeted interventions to combat the growing threat of antimicrobial resistance in Iraq's healthcare landscape.",
