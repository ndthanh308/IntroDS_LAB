  "abstract": "A Denjoy domain is a plane domain whose complement is a closed subset $E$ of the extended real line $\\bar{R}$ containing $\\infty$ : such a domain is called Carleson-homogeneous if there exists $C>0$ such that for all $z\\in E$ and $r>0$, one has $\\vert E\\cap [z-r,z+r]\\vert\\geq Cr$, where $\\vert\\cdot\\vert$ is the Lebesgue measure on the line. We prove that if $U=\\bar{ \\mathbb C}\\backslash K$ is a Carleson-homogeneous Denjoy domain then, if $f$ stands for one of its universal coverings, $\\log {f'}\\in BMOA.$ In order to prove this result, we develop ideas from\n  [On Carleson measures induced by Beltrami coefficients being compatible with Fuchsian groups, Ann. Fenn. Math. 46(2021),67-77] leading to a general theorem about planar domains giving sufficient conditions ensuring that $\\log {f'}\\in BMOA$ for any universal covering $f.$",
