  "abstract": "The contribution of hadronic scattering of light-by-light to the hyperfine structure of muonium is calculated using experimental data on the transition form factors of two photons into a hadron. The amplitudes of interaction between a muon and an electron with horizontal and vertical exchange are constructed. The contributions due to the exchange of pseudoscalar, axial vector, scalar and tensor mesons are taken into account.",
