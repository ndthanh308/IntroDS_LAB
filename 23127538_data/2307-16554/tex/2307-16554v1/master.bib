abstract={This paper reports findings from an experimental study of voluntary participation games, as considered by Dixit and Olson (2000). The voluntary participation game consists of two stages: a non-cooperative participation decision followed by Coasian bargaining on public goods provision only among those who choose to participate. Our experimental findings show that, consistent with the theoretical findings of Dixit and Olson, the outcome of this game falls short of full efficiency. However, we find that voluntary participation undermines the Coase Theorem to a lesser extent than predicted by Dixit and Olson, particularly with larger numbers of players. We also investigate the effect of pre-play communication on the public goods provision and find little evidence that cheap talk helps subjects coordinate on the efficient outcome of coalition formation in the laboratory. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract={This paper reports controlled experiments on markets linking downstream water entitlement holders with upstream landholders wishing to establish large tree plantations. The present study tackles the question of whether it matters who owns the initial water rights. Coase's (1960) theorem suggests initial endowments will not affect final equilibrium outcomes, in terms of water prices and water rights held by the various parties. That theorem is tested through experiments with human subjects who blindly represent different groups of water users. These are land owners in upstream water supply sub-catchments and downstream urban, irrigation and 'stock \& domestic' water users, each with pre-specified marginal values of water. These values and equilibrium results calculated in an earlier modelling study provide the theoretical base for evaluating the new results. In the experiment the initial endowments of water rights were shifted between the up and downstream participants. Strong 'endowment effects' were observed; participants who held the greatest initial endowments often traded away fewer units than predicted by the theoretical model and captured greater shares of the gains of trade. Including new tree plantations in the market for permanent water entitlements can engender positive changes in economic surpluses in all sectors, with greater levels of social equity and protection of downstream wetland assets. This is in sharp contrast with reductions in river volumes reaching downstream parties and environmental assets in the absence of regulations requiring purchase of entitlements to cover extra water use by new plantations. © IWA Publishing 2011.},

abstract={While the Coase Theorem has been a touchstone for understanding bargaining behavior, it has also been criticized for relying on unrealistic assumptions. In response, a line of experimental research analyzes bargaining behavior in laboratory settings. This paper uses meta-analysis to evaluate the Coasean bargaining literature by modeling the probability of an efficient bargain as a function of: (1) measures of transaction costs and related variables, and (2) measures of the social dimensions of a bargain. Results suggest that efficient solutions are more likely when explicit transaction costs do not exist in the absence of a binding time limit, and when participants have perfect information on payoff schedules. Social dimension variables are found to have the potential to affect bargaining outcomes and are an important avenue for further research.},

Long the domain of legally minded psychologists and criminologists, experimental methods are gaining significant popularity among economists interested in exploring positive and normative aspects of law. Because this literature is relatively new among legally-minded economists, we spend some time in this survey on methodological points, with particular attention to the role of experiments within theoretical and empirical scholarship, the core ingredients of a well done experiment, and common distinctions between experimental economics and other fields that use experimental methods. We then consider a number of areas where experimental evidence is increasingly playing a role in testing the underlying foundational precepts of economic behavior as it applies to law, including bargaining in the shadow of the law, the selection of suits for litigation, and the investigation of jury and judge behavior. Our survey concludes by offering some suggestions about what directions experimental economists might push the methodology in the study of legal rules. © 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

In the Paper River, pairs of students share a single productive resource: small pieces of paper. At question is who has the rights to the paper. The author presents a modified version of the game that retains many of the same elements from the original, but the students work in groups rather than in pairs. Doing so increases the transaction costs associated with negotiating a solution. In addition, the productive resource is common property, so property rights are difficult to establish. These difficulties make a Coasian solution more difficult but make the simulation more realistic. © 2002 Taylor \& Francis Group, LLC.},

The ANCSA was a major event that settled issues of Native land claims and property rights in Alaska, and had profound implications for economic, social, political, and cultural aspects of life for Alaska Natives and non-natives alike. In particular, the issues of clearly defined and secure property rights, and positive transaction costs will be analyzed, as they both play a key role in the outcome of the negotiations. An analysis of the Coase theorem to the ANCSA is particularly relevant here, since the Coase theorem states that under a situation with minimal to no transaction costs, economic agents will bargain with one another to reach an agreement that is socially optimal. The introduction of economic frictions, including transaction costs and insecure property rights, is particularly relevant since they are reflective of the bargaining situation between the Alaska Natives and the United States federal government. These frictions had a profound effect on the bargaining outcome, as is evinced by the outcome and subsequent impact of the ANCSA on the Alaska Native people.},

Yet management actions to curtail the red deer population are largely in the hands of private estates, who may have little incentive to reduce deer numbers because of the influence of deer numbers on capital values. In this paper we first briefly describe the red deer problem, then characterize it as an externality over which possible bargains could be struck.
