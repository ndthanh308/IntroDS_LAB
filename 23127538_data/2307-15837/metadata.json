  "abstract": "We address the existence of global solutions to the initial value problem for the integrable nonlocal derivative nonlinear Schrödinger equation in weighted Sobolev space $H^{2}(\\mathbb{R})\\cap H^{1,1}(\\mathbb{R})$. The key to prove this result is to establish a bijectivity between potential and reflection coefficient by using the inverse scattering transform method in the form of the Riemann-Hilbert problem.",
