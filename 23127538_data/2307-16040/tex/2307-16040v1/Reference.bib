abstract={The high pressure structures, metallization and superconductivity of recently synthesized H2-containing compounds (H2S)2H2 are elucidated by ab initio calculations. The ordered crystal structure with P1 symmetry is determined, supported by the good agreement between theoretical and experimental X-ray diffraction data, equation of states and Raman spectra. The Cccm structure is favorable with partial hydrogen bond symmetrization above 37 GPa. Upon further compression, H2 molecules disappear and two intriguing metallic structures with R3m and Im-3m symmetries are reconstructive above 111 and 180 GPa, respectively. The predicted metallization pressure is 111 GPa, which is approximately one-third of the currently suggested metallization pressure of bulk molecular hydrogen. Application of the Allen-Dynes-modified McMillan equation for the Im-3m structure yields high Tc values of 191 K to 204 K at 200 GPa, which is among the highest values reported for H2-rich van der Waals compounds and MH3 type hydride thus far.},

The phase diagram of solid H2S at high pressures remains largely unexplored arising from the challenges in dealing with the pressure-induced weakening of S–H bond and larger atomic core difference between H and S. Metallization is yet achieved for H2O, but it was observed for H2S above 96 GPa. However, the metallic structure of H2S remains elusive, greatly impeding the understanding of its metallicity and the potential superconductivity. We have performed an extensive structural study on solid H2S at pressure ranges of 10–200 GPa through an unbiased structure prediction method based on particle swarm optimization algorithm. Besides the findings of candidate structures for nonmetallic phases IV and V, we are able to establish stable metallic structures violating an earlier proposal of elemental decomposition into sulfur and hydrogen [R. Rousseau, M. Boero, M. Bernasconi, M. Parrinello, and K. Terakura, Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 1254 (2000)]. Our study unravels a superconductive potential of metallic H2S with an estimated maximal transition temperature of ∼80 K at 160 GPa, higher than those predicted for most archetypal hydrogen-containing compounds (e.g., SiH4, GeH4, etc.).}",

abstract={A recent study demonstrated near-ambient superconductivity in nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride1. This stimulated a worldwide interest in exploring room-temperature superconductivity at low pressures. Here, by using a high-pressure and high-temperature synthesis technique, we have obtained nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride (LuH2{\textpm}xNy), which has a dark-blue colour and a structure with the space group {\$}{\$}Fm{\backslash}bar{\{}3{\}}m{\$}{\$}as evidenced by X-ray diffraction. This structure is the same as that reported in ref.{\thinspace}1, with a slight difference in lattice constant. Raman spectroscopy of our samples also showed patterns similar to those observed in ref.{\thinspace}1. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy confirmed the presence of nitrogen in the samples. We observed a metallic behaviour from 350{\thinspace}K to 2{\thinspace}K at ambient pressure. On applying pressures from 2.1{\thinspace}GPa to 41{\thinspace}GPa, we observed a gradual colour change from dark blue to violet to pink-red. By measuring the resistance at pressures ranging from 0.4{\thinspace}GPa to 40.1{\thinspace}GPa, we observed a progressively improved metallic behaviour; however, superconductivity was not observed above 2{\thinspace}K. Temperature dependence of magnetization at high pressure shows a very weak positive signal between 100{\thinspace}K and 320{\thinspace}K, and the magnetization increases with an increase in magnetic field at 100{\thinspace}K. All of these are not expected for superconductivity above 100{\thinspace}K. Thus, we conclude the absence of near-ambient superconductivity in this nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride at pressures below 40.1{\thinspace}GPa.},

abstract={By applying pressures up to 42 GPa on the nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride (LuH2+xNy), we have found a gradual change of color from dark-blue to pink-violet in the pressure region of about 12 to 21 GPa. The temperature dependence of resistivity under pressures up to 50.5 GPa shows progressively optimized metallic behavior with pressure. Interestingly, in the pressure region for the color change, a clear decrease of resistivity is observed with the increase of pressure, which is accompanied by a clear increase of the residual resistivity ratio (RRR). Fitting to the low temperature resistivity gives exponents of about 2, suggesting a Fermi-liquid behavior in the low temperature region. The general behavior in a wide temperature region suggests that the electron-phonon scattering is still the dominant one. The magnetoresistance up to 9 T in the state under a pressure of 50.5 GPa shows an almost negligible effect, which suggests that the electric conduction in the pink-violet state is dominated by a single band. It is highly desired to have theoretical efforts in understanding the evolution of color and resistivity in this interesting system.},

abstract={High-transition-temperature (high-Tc) superconductivity in cuprates has been discovered for more than three decades, but the underlying mechanism remains a mystery1-4. Cuprates are the only unconventional superconducting family that host bulk superconductivity with Tcs above the liquid nitrogen boiling temperature at 77 K. Here we observe signatures of superconductivity in single crystals of La3Ni2O7 with a maximum Tc of 80 K at pressures between {\$}{\$}14.0-43.5{\$}{\$}GPa from high-pressure resistance and mutual inductive magnetic susceptibility measurements. The superconducting phase under high pressure exhibits an orthorhombic structure of Fmmm space group with the 3{\$}{\$}{\{}d{\}}{\_}{\{}{\{}x{\}}^{\{}2{\}}-{\{}y{\}}^{\{}2{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}and 3{\$}{\$}{\{}d{\}}{\_}{\{}{\{}z{\}}^{\{}2{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}orbitals of Ni cations strongly mixing with oxygen 2p orbitals.

Thus, our discoveries not only reveal important clues for the high-Tc superconductivity in this Ruddlesden-Popper double-layered perovskite nickelates but also provide a new family of compounds to investigate the high-Tc superconductivity mechanism.},

abstract = {Modeling high-temperature superconductivity (HTS) remains extremely challenging. Many researchers believe that the simplest model that captures HTS is the Hubbard model, which accounts for interactions and allows for electrons to hop from one site of a lattice to another. However, even just determining whether the ground state of this model supports superconductivity is tricky. Jiang and Devereaux undertook an extensive computational study based on a method known as density matrix renormalization group. They found that for a particular concentration of empty lattice sites, superconductivity indeed appears as a long-range state, but only if electrons are allowed to hop to sites that are next to their immediate neighbors on the lattice. Science, this issue p. 1424 Density matrix renormalization group calculations explore the ground state of the Hubbard model with next-nearest hopping. The Hubbard model is widely believed to contain the essential ingredients of high-temperature superconductivity. However, proving definitively that the model supports superconductivity is challenging. Here, we report a large-scale density matrix renormalization group study of the lightly doped Hubbard model on four-leg cylinders at hole doping concentration δ = 12.5\%. We reveal a delicate interplay between superconductivity and charge density wave and spin density wave orders tunable via next-nearest neighbor hopping t′. For finite t′, the ground state is consistent with a Luther-Emery liquid with power-law superconducting and charge density wave correlations associated with half-filled charge stripes. In contrast, for t′ = 0, superconducting correlations fall off exponentially, whereas charge density and spin density modulations are dominant. Our results indicate that a route to robust long-range superconductivity involves destabilizing insulating charge stripes in the doped Hubbard model.}}

In detail, the formation energy landscape of Lu–H–N is derived and utilized to assess the thermodynamic stability of each compound that is created via element substitution. The result indicates that there is no stable ternary structure in the Lu–H–N chemical system, however, metastable ternary structures, such as Lu20H2N17 (C2/m) and Lu2H2N (), are observed to have small E hull (&lt; 100 meV/atom). It is also found that the energy convex hull of the Lu–H–N system shifts its shape when applying hydrostatic pressure up to 10 GPa, and the external pressure stabilizes a couple of binary phases such as LuN9 and Lu10H21. Additionally, interstitial voids in LuH2 are observed, which may explain the formation of Lu10H21 and LuH3–δ N ε . To provide a basis for comparison, x-ray diffraction patterns and electronic structures of some compounds are also presented.}

abstract = {Sulfur and lanthanum hydrides under compression display superconducting states with high observed critical temperatures. It has been recently demonstrated that carbonaceous sulfur hydride displays room temperature superconductivity. However, this phenomenon has been observed only at very high pressure. Here, we theoretically search for superconductors with very high critical temperatures, but at much lower pressures. We describe two of such sodalite-type clathrate hydrides, YbH6 and LuH6. These hydrides are metastable and are predicted to superconduct with T c ∼ 145 K at 70 GPa and T c ∼ 273 K at 100 GPa, respectively. This striking result is a consequence of the strong interrelationship between the f states present at the Fermi level, structural stability, and the final T c value. For example, TmH6, with unfilled 4f orbitals, is stable at 50 GPa, but has a relatively low value of T c of 25 K. The YbH6 and LuH6 compounds, with their filled f-shells, exhibit prominent phonon “softening”, which leads to a strong electron-phonon coupling, and as a result, an increase in T c.}

abstract = {Using the data on the superconducting critical temperature (TC) for a number of metal hydrides, we found a rule that makes it possible to predict the maximum TC based only on the information about the electronic structure of metal atoms. Using this guiding principle, we explored the hydride systems for which no reliable information existed, predicted new higher hydrides in the K-H, Zr-H, Hf-H, Ti-H, Mg-H, Sr-H, Ba-H, Cs-H, and Rb-H systems at high pressures, and calculated their TC. The highest-temperature superconducting hydrides are formed by metals in the “lability belt” roughly between 2nd and 3rd groups of the Periodic Table. Results of the study of actinoids and lanthanoids show that they form highly symmetric superhydrides XH7-XH9, but the increasing number of d- and especially f-electrons affects superconducitivity adversely. Hydrides of late transition metals (e.g. platinoids) and all but early lanthanoids and actinoids are not promising for high-Tc superconductivity. Designed neural network allowing the prediction of TC of various hydrides shows high accuracy and was used to estimate upper limit for TC of hydrides for which no date are avilable. The developed rule, based on regular behavior of the maximum achievable critical temperature as a function of number of d + f electrons, enables targeted predictions about the existence of new high-TC superconductors.}

abstract={The absence of electrical resistance exhibited by superconducting materials would have enormous potential for applications if it existed at ambient temperature and pressure conditions. Despite decades of intense research efforts, such a state has yet to be realized1,2. At ambient pressures, cuprates are the material class exhibiting superconductivity to the highest critical superconducting transition temperatures (Tc), up to about 133{\thinspace}K (refs.{\thinspace}3--5). Over the past decade, high-pressure `chemical precompression'6,7 of hydrogen-dominant alloys has led the search for high-temperature superconductivity, with demonstrated Tc approaching the freezing point of water in binary hydrides at megabar pressures8--13. Ternary hydrogen-rich compounds, such as carbonaceous sulfur hydride, offer an even larger chemical space to potentially improve the properties of superconducting hydrides14--21. Here we report evidence of superconductivity on a nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride with a maximum Tc of 294{\thinspace}K at 10{\thinspace}kbar, that is, superconductivity at room temperature and near-ambient pressures. The compound was synthesized under high-pressure high-temperature conditions and then---after full recoverability---its material and superconducting properties were examined along compression pathways. These include temperature-dependent resistance with and without an applied magnetic field, the magnetization (M) versus magnetic field (H) curve, a.c. and d.c. magnetic susceptibility, as well as heat-capacity measurements. X-ray diffraction (XRD), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) and theoretical simulations provide some insight into the stoichiometry of the synthesized material. Nevertheless, further experiments and simulations are needed to determine the exact stoichiometry of hydrogen and nitrogen, and their respective atomistic positions, in a greater effort to further understand the superconducting state of the material.},

We find that when including the correction, the adsorption site preference for six of the metals changes, and all adsorption site predictions become accurate. We also collect a large number of experimental studies for comparison with our calculated adsorption energies. The mean absolute deviation including the correction is found to be less than 0.2eV, showing that the RPBE functional gives a much better quantitative agreement between experiments and calculations than the PW91 functional.}

abstract = {High-resolution core-level photoemission at an energy resolution better than the intrinsic width of the C 1s level has been used to study the CO/Rh(111) overlayer system. C 1s spectra have been measured in a large CO coverage range; from low coverages, where the CO molecules only adsorb in on-top positions, to saturation coverage, where CO molecules occupy both on-top and threefold hollow sites. Fine structure components due to vibrational excitation of the C–O stretch mode are clearly resolved in the emission peak from each site. The vibrational splittings and intensity ratios are found to be different for the different adsorption sites. A third C 1s component, which has not been resolved earlier, is found at intermediate CO coverages. Some possible explanations for the origin of this extra component are discussed. In the light of its binding energy and vibrational energy in photoemission, together with supporting evidence from high-resolution electron energy loss spectroscopy data and photoelectron diffraction, this is assigned to bridging CO species at intermediate coverages.}

In this report, we investigate and compare CO adsorption behavior on Pt (111) and Pd (111) surfaces combining first-principles (FP) calculations and lattice gas Monte-Carlo (LG-MC) simulations. Our results indicate that despite stronger CO binding on Pd (111) at low coverage, more repulsive lateral interactions on Pd surface lead to a more rapid adsorption energy decrease with respect to coverage. This results in lower saturation coverage and weaker CO desorption energies on Pd (111), which could contribute to its excellent reactivity observed under high pressure reaction conditions.}

We show that an advanced version of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) can be created on the basis of our method, but PSO is strongly outperformed by USPEX. We also show how ideas from metadynamics can be used in the context of evolutionary structure prediction for escaping from local minima. Our cluster structure prediction algorithm, using the ideas initially developed for crystals, also shows excellent performance and outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms.}

abstract = {We present studies of the isothermal desorption of carbon monoxide from the three low index rhodium surfaces using time-resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy (TREELS). We use a quasiequilibrium model and apply lattice gas theory and the transfer matrix technique to model the desorption isotherms. With the further assumption that the nearest neighbor interaction energy between chemisorbed CO molecules is large and repulsive, we extract the second and third neighbor lattice energies for all three surfaces. We compare our results with the ordered CO overlayer structures reported by low electron energy diffraction measurements. We find that the lateral interaction energies on all three surfaces exhibit weak but non-negligible repulsion and attraction. We also examine and discuss the validity of the quasiequilibrium assumption in analyzing desorption measurements. Finally, we compare and discuss the trends in observed CO structures on various transition metal surfaces.}

abstract = {High resolution photoemission applied to the C 1s and Rh 3d core levels has been used to investigate the adsorption sites at low temperature of CO on the Rh(111) single crystal surface as a function of CO coverage. Two different sites are found to be occupied by the CO molecules. At coverages up to 0.5 monolayers the majority of the molecules are found to adsorb in on-top sites whereas at higher coverages three-fold hollow sites become increasingly populated. The different C 1s binding energy of the CO molecules in these two sites makes it possible to measure diffraction induced intensity variations versus photon energy in a site specific manner. The saturation (2 x 2)-3CO structure formed at a coverage of 0.75 monolayers is argued to contain one on-top and two three-fold hollow molecules per unit cell.}

A means of calculating reliable values for the solid-liquid energy is presented, which then allows an accurate estimate of solid surface energy at the melting temperature, Tm, to be made for the large number of elements for which dependable liquid surface tension data exist. A method of estimating surface entropy is presented, and has been used to calculate the energies typical of “average�? high-index surfaces at temperatures ranging from 0 K to Tm. It is felt that this paper describes the most accurate method presently available for the calculation of the surface energy of solids in the absence of direct experimental measurement.}

The dawn of computational databases has made the integration of analysis, prediction and discovery the key theme in accelerated alloy research. Advances in machine-learning methods and enhanced data generation have created a fertile ground for computational materials science. Pairing machine learning and alloys has proven to be particularly instrumental in pushing progress in a wide variety of materials, including metallic glasses, high-entropy alloys, shape-memory alloys, magnets, superalloys, catalysts and structural materials. This Review examines the present state of machine-learning-driven alloy research, discusses the approaches and applications in the field and summarizes theoretical predictions and experimental validations. We foresee that the partnership between machine learning and alloys will lead to the design of new and improved systems.},

abstract = {We present a new interatomic potential for solids and liquids called Spectral Neighbor Analysis Potential (SNAP). The SNAP potential has a very general form and uses machine-learning techniques to reproduce the energies, forces, and stress tensors of a large set of small configurations of atoms, which are obtained using high-accuracy quantum electronic structure (QM) calculations. The local environment of each atom is characterized by a set of bispectrum components of the local neighbor density projected onto a basis of hyperspherical harmonics in four dimensions. The bispectrum components are the same bond-orientational order parameters employed by the GAP potential [1]. The SNAP potential, unlike GAP, assumes a linear relationship between atom energy and bispectrum components. The linear SNAP coefficients are determined using weighted least-squares linear regression against the full QM training set. This allows the SNAP potential to be fit in a robust, automated manner to large QM data sets using many bispectrum components. The calculation of the bispectrum components and the SNAP potential are implemented in the LAMMPS parallel molecular dynamics code. We demonstrate that a previously unnoticed symmetry property can be exploited to reduce the computational cost of the force calculations by more than one order of magnitude. We present results for a SNAP potential for tantalum, showing that it accurately reproduces a range of commonly calculated properties of both the crystalline solid and the liquid phases. In addition, unlike simpler existing potentials, SNAP correctly predicts the energy barrier for screw dislocation migration in BCC tantalum.}

abstract = {We present a new interatomic potential capable of describing the cubic and tetragonal phases of zirconia. From an analysis of molecular-dynamics simulations of the structural fluctuations in the cubic phase close to the transition temperature, we show that the cubic-to-tetragonal transition is displacive. In addition, the discontinuous change in volume and the latent heat at the transition demonstrate clearly that the transition is first order. The model correctly predicts that doping with yttria tends to stabilize the cubic phase at lower temperatures. A description of the first-order nature of dopant-driven transitions is given.},

abstract={Machine-learned interatomic potentials enable realistic finite temperature calculations of complex materials properties with first-principles accuracy. It is not yet clear, however, how accurately they describe anharmonic properties, which are crucial for predicting the lattice thermal conductivity and phase transitions in solids and, thus, shape their technological applications. Here we employ a recently developed on-the-fly learning technique based on molecular dynamics and Bayesian inference in order to generate an interatomic potential capable to describe the thermodynamic properties of zirconia, an important transition metal oxide. This machine-learned potential accurately captures the temperature-induced phase transitions below the melting point. We further showcase the predictive power of the potential by calculating the heat transport on the basis of Green-Kubo theory, which allows to account for anharmonic effects to all orders. This study indicates that machine-learned potentials trained on the fly offer a routine solution for accurate and efficient simulations of the thermodynamic properties of a vast class of anharmonic materials.},

abstract={Computational modeling of chemical and biological systems at atomic resolution is a crucial tool in the chemist’s toolset. The use of computer simulations requires a balance between cost and accuracy: quantum-mechanical methods provide high accuracy but are computationally expensive and scale poorly to large systems, while classical force fields are cheap and scalable, but lack transferability to new systems. Machine learning can be used to achieve the best of both approaches. Here we train a general-purpose neural network potential (ANI-1ccx) that approaches CCSD(T)/CBS accuracy on benchmarks for reaction thermochemistry, isomerization, and drug-like molecular torsions. This is achieved by training a network to DFT data then using transfer learning techniques to retrain on a dataset of gold standard QM calculations (CCSD(T)/CBS) that optimally spans chemical space. The resulting potential is broadly applicable to materials science, biology, and chemistry, and billions of times faster than CCSD(T)/CBS calculations.},

However, the predictive power of these simulations is only as good as the underlying interatomic potential. Classical potentials often fail to faithfully capture key quantum effects in molecules and materials. Here we enable the direct construction of flexible molecular force fields from high-level ab initio calculations by incorporating spatial and temporal physical symmetries into a gradient-domain machine learning (sGDML) model in an automatic data-driven way. The developed sGDML approach faithfully reproduces global force fields at quantum-chemical CCSD(T) level of accuracy and allows converged molecular dynamics simulations with fully quantized electrons and nuclei. We present MD simulations, for flexible molecules with up to a few dozen atoms and provide insights into the dynamical behavior of these molecules.

This collection of statistical methods has already proved to be capable of considerably speeding up both fundamental and applied research.

We provide a comprehensive overview and analysis of the most recent research in this topic. As a starting point, we introduce machine learning principles, algorithms, descriptors, and databases in materials science. We continue with the description of different machine learning approaches for the discovery of stable materials and the prediction of their crystal structure. Then we discuss research in numerous quantitative structure�Cproperty relationships and various approaches for the replacement of first-principle methods by machine learning. We review how active learning and surrogate-based optimization can be applied to improve the rational design process and related examples of applications. Two major questions are always the interpretability of and the physical understanding gained from machine learning models. We consider therefore the different facets of interpretability and their importance in materials science. Finally, we propose solutions and future research paths for various challenges in computational materials science.},

Here we present an expression for the free energy that does not suffer from such shortcomings, and we show by self-consistent ab initio lattice dynamical calculations (SCAILD), that the critical temperature for the hcp-to-bcc phase transformation in Ti, Zr and Hf, can be effectively calculated from the free-energy difference between the two phases. This opens up the possibility to study quantitatively, from first-principles theory, temperature-induced phase transitions.}

The form of this universal function is determined by sealing experimental compression data for measured isotherms of a wide variety of solids. The equation of state is thus known (in the absence of phase transitions), if zero-pressure volume and isothermal compression and its pressure derivative are known. The discovery described by the authors has two immediate consequences: first, despite the well known differences in the microscopic energetics of the various classes of solids, there is a single equation of state for all classes in compression; and second, a new method is provided for analysing measured isotherms and extrapolating high-pressure data from low-pressure (e.g. acoustic) data.}

abstract = {Abstract Modern simulation techniques have reached a level of maturity which allows a wide range of problems in chemistry and materials science to be addressed. Unfortunately, the application of first principles methods with predictive power is still limited to rather small systems, and despite the rapid evolution of computer hardware no fundamental change in this situation can be expected. Consequently, the development of more efficient but equally reliable atomistic potentials to reach an atomic level understanding of complex systems has received considerable attention in recent years. A promising new development has been the introduction of machine learning (ML) methods to describe the atomic interactions. Once trained with electronic structure data, ML potentials can accelerate computer simulations by several orders of magnitude, while preserving quantum mechanical accuracy. This Review considers the methodology of an important class of ML potentials that employs artificial neural networks.},

abstract = {The high-temperature structure of zirconia was studied by powder neutron diffraction up to 2400°C. The boundaries of the domain of the nonstoichiometric tetragonal form are defined. They are consistent with a tetragonal-cubic transition at 2350°C for stoichiometric zirconia. The changes in the structural parameters of the tetragonal form (unit-cell, positional parameters and thermal B factors) with temperature give evidence of medium zirconium and oxygen mobilities. The oxygen ions are, however, always more mobile than the zirconium ions. An enhancement with temperature of the structural an-isotropy tends to weaken the weaker of the two distinct Zr-0 bonds of the tetragonal zirconia. It results in the transformation into the cubic form which is accompanied by a change in unit-cell volume; this change becomes sharper as the composition tends toward stoichiometry. This transition is probably followed by an increase of the ionic mobility.},

Here we show that the relative equilibrium between liquid gallium, ��-Ga, ��-Ga, and Ga-II is well described. The resulting phase diagram is in agreement with the experimental findings. The local structure of liquid gallium and its nucleation into ��-Ga and ��-Ga are studied. We find that the formation of metastable ��-Ga is kinetically favored over the thermodinamically stable ��-Ga. Finally, we provide insight into the experimental observations of extreme undercooling of liquid Ga.},

Our model is fitted to density-functional theory plus many-body dispersion (DFT?+?MBD) data; its accuracy is demonstrated for the exfoliation of black and violet phosphorus (yielding monolayers of ��phosphorene�� and ��hittorfene��); its transferability is shown for the transition between the molecular and network liquid phases. An application to a phosphorene nanoribbon on an experimentally relevant length scale exemplifies the power of accurate and flexible ML-driven force fields for next-generation materials modelling. The methodology promises new insights into phosphorus as well as other structurally complex, e.g., layered solids that are relevant in diverse areas of chemistry, physics, and materials science.},

The axial ratio c/a increases with increasing pressure for α-Zr, but it is nearly invariant under compression for ω-Zr. Within the quasi-harmonic Debye model, the full phase diagram of Zr was obtained. The zero pressure phase transition from α-Zr to β-Zr occurs at 1130K. The transition pressure from α-Zr to ω-Zr at 300K is 2.10GPa and the predicted triple point is at 6.35GPa, 910K, which is close to the experimental data. The thermal properties including the entropy, isotherm, isobar and thermal pressure in a wide range of pressure and temperature were predicted successfully."

abstract = "The production and applications of zirconium and based materials are analyzed in this review. The main properties which make the metal attractive in use are its high strength when alloyed with other materials, its outstanding corrosion resistance. This metal preferable in industrial, marine and other environments, good metallurgical workability and superior fatigue resistance. For upcoming originations tough ceramics and its oxide compound, Zirconia, also known as zirconium dioxide, ZrO2 has become a base material. For fiber reinforcement also the ceramics are applicable and recently several latest ceramic fabrication techniques are investigated. This review is a collection of details regarding the physical properties, mechanical properties, fabrication and procurement of zirconium and its based materials. The material zirconium and its alloys have excellent corrosion �?radiation-resistance properties and so that it can be used as nuclear reactor core materials such as fuel cladding and guide tubes. The experimental results on manufacturing of ceramics using Aluminum oxide with a regular structure which gives high strengthening properties and the extensive usage in different streams of technology were investigated. With the highly disperse powders new ceramic materials having a high strength were found out."

abstract = "The phase diagram of zirconium metal has been studied using synchrotron X-ray diffraction and time-of-flight neutron scattering at temperatures and pressures up to 1273K and 17GPa. The equilibrium phase boundary of the α–�?transition has a dT/dP slope of 473K/GPa, and the extrapolated transition pressure at ambient temperature is located at 3.4GPa. For the ω–�?transition, the phase boundary has a negative dT/dP slope of 15.5K/GPa between 6.4 and 15.3GPa, which is substantially smaller than a previously reported value of �?9±5K/GPa in the pressure range of 32�?5GPa. This difference indicates a significant curvature of the phase boundary between 15.3 and 35GPa. The α–ω–�?triple point was estimated to be at 4.9GPa and 953K, which is comparable to previous results obtained from a differential thermal analysis. Except for the three known crystalline forms, the β phase of zirconium metal was found to possess an extraordinary glass forming ability at pressures between 6.4 and 8.6GPa. This transformation leads to a limited stability field for the β phase in the pressure range of 6�?6GPa and to complications of high-temperature portion of phase diagram for zirconium metal."

Unfortunately, being linear combinations of up to all the data points, these vectors are notoriously difficult to interpret in terms of the data and processes generating the data. In this article, we develop CUR matrix decompositions for improved data analysis. CUR decompositions are low-rank matrix decompositions that are explicitly expressed in terms of a small number of actual columns and/or actual rows of the data matrix. Because they are constructed from actual data elements, CUR decompositions are interpretable by practitioners of the field from which the data are drawn (to the extent that the original data are). We present an algorithm that preferentially chooses columns and rows that exhibit high {\textquotedblleft}statistical leverage{\textquotedblright} and, thus, in a very precise statistical sense, exert a disproportionately large {\textquotedblleft}influence{\textquotedblright} on the best low-rank fit of the data matrix. By selecting columns and rows in this manner, we obtain improved relative-error and constant-factor approximation guarantees in worst-case analysis, as opposed to the much coarser additive-error guarantees of prior work. In addition, since the construction involves computing quantities with a natural and widely studied statistical interpretation, we can leverage ideas from diagnostic regression analysis to employ these matrix decompositions for exploratory data analysis.},

It was found that the actual structure of the gamma phase is orthorhombic, space group Cccm, rather than tetragonal as previously believed. The one-phonon deuterium optical band in the INS spectrum was observed at an energy transfer of 107 meV (with the main feature at 103.4 meV), which is higher than the deuterium vibrational energies for all other phases of the Zr-D system. Distinct features were also observed in the INS spectrum below the free multiphonon bands, which were explained as the bound multiphonon states.}

	journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},

	abstract = {Recently, two nonempirical hybrid functionals, dielectric-dependent range-separated hybrid functional based on the Coulomb-attenuating method (DD-RSH-CAM) and doubly screened hybrid functional (DSH), have been suggested by Chen et al (2018 Phys. Rev. Mater. 2 073803) and Cui et al (2018 J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 9 2338), respectively. These two hybrid functionals are both based on a common model dielectric function approach, but differ in the way how to non-empirically obtain the range-separation parameter. By retaining the full short-range Fock exchange and a fraction of the long-range Fock exchange that equals the inverse of the dielectric constant, both DD-RSH-CAM and DSH turn out to perform very well in predicting the band gaps for a large variety of semiconductors and insulators. Here, we assess how these two hybrid functionals perform on challenging antiferromagnetic transition-metal monoxides MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO by comparing them to other conventional hybrid functionals and the GW method. We find that single-shot DD0-RSH-CAM and DSH0 improve the band gaps towards experiments as compared to conventional hybrid functionals. The magnetic moments are slightly increased, but the predicted dielectric constants are decreased. The valence band density of states (DOS) predicted by DD0-RSH-CAM and DSH0 are as satisfactory as HSE03 in comparison to experimental spectra, however, the conduction band DOS are shifted to higher energies by about 2�eV compared to HSE03. Self-consistent DD-RSH-CAM and DSH deteriorate the results with a significant overestimation of band gaps.}

   abstract = {Enhanced coupling of material properties offers new fundamental insights and routes to multifunctional devices. In this context 5d oxides provide new paradigms of cooperative interactions that drive novel emergent behaviour. This is exemplified in osmates that host metal�Cinsulator transitions where magnetic order appears intimately entwined. Here we consider such a material, the 5d perovskite NaOsO3, and observe a coupling between spin and phonon manifested in a frequency shift of 40?cm?1, the largest measured in any material. The anomalous modes are shown to involve solely Os�CO interactions and magnetism is revealed as the driving microscopic mechanism for the phonon renormalization. The magnitude of the coupling in NaOsO3 is primarily due to a property common to all 5d materials: the large spatial extent of the ion. This allows magnetism to couple to phonons on an unprecedented scale and in general offers multiple new routes to enhanced coupled phenomena in 5d materials.},

abstract = {{\it AMPLIMODES} is a computer program available on the Bilbao Crystallographic Server that can perform a symmetry-mode analysis of any distorted structure of displacive type. The analysis consists in decomposing the symmetry-breaking distortion present in the distorted structure into contributions from different symmetry-adapted modes. Given the high- and the low-symmetry structures, {\it AMPLIMODES} determines the atomic displacements that relate them, defines a basis of symmetry-adapted modes, and calculates the amplitudes and polarization vectors of the distortion modes of different symmetry frozen in the structure. The program uses a mode parameterization that is as close as possible to the crystallographic conventions, expressing all quantities for the asymmetric unit of the low-symmetry structure. Distorted structures are often related to their higher-symmetry counterparts by temperature- and/or pressure-driven phase transitions, ferroic phase transitions being a particular example. The automatic symmetry-mode analysis performed by {\it AMPLIMODES} can be very useful for establishing the driving mechanisms of such structural phase transitions or the fundamental instabilities at the origin of the distorted phases.},

   abstract = {Atomic simulations provide an effective means to understand the underlying physics of structural phase transformations. However, this remains a challenge for certain allotropic metals due to the failure of classical interatomic potentials to represent the multitude of bonding. Based on machine-learning (ML) techniques, we develop a hybrid method in which interatomic potentials describing martensitic transformations can be learned with a high degree of fidelity from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD). Using zirconium as a model system, for which an adequate semiempirical potential describing the phase transformation process is lacking, we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, the ML-AIMD interatomic potential correctly captures the energetics and structural transformation properties of zirconium as compared to experimental and density-functional data for phonons, elastic constants, as well as stacking fault energies. Molecular dynamics simulations successfully reproduce the transformation mechanisms and reasonably map out the pressure�Ctemperature phase diagram of zirconium.},

abstract={THE recent discovery1 of superconductivity below a transition temperature (Tc) of 94 K in HgBa2CuO4+$\delta$ has extended the repertoire of high-Tc superconductors containing copper oxide planes embedded in suitably structured (layered) materials. Previous experience with similar compounds containing bismuth and thallium instead of mercury suggested that even higher transition temperatures might be achieved in mercury-based compounds with more than one CuO2 layer per unit cell. Here we provide support for this conjecture, with the discovery of superconductivity above 130 K in a material containing HgBa2Ca2Cu3O1+x (with three CuO2 layers per unit cell), HgBa2CaCu2O6+x (with two CuO2 layers) and an ordered superstructure comprising a defined sequence of the unit cells of these phases. Both magnetic and resistivity measurements confirm a maximum transition temperature of ∼ 133 K, distinctly higher than the previous established record value of 125--127 K observed in Tl2Ba2Ca2Cu3O10 (refs 2,3).},

abstract={In the light of the tremendous progress that has been made in raising the transition temperature of the copper oxide superconductors (for a review, see ref. 1), it is natural to wonder how high the transition temperature, Tc, can be pushed in other classes of materials. At present, the highest reported values of Tc for non-copper-oxide bulk superconductivity are 33{\thinspace}K in electron-doped CsxRbyC60 (ref. 2), and 30{\thinspace}K in Ba1-xKxBiO3 (ref. 3). (Hole-doped C60 was recently found4 to be superconducting with a Tc as high as 52{\thinspace}K, although the nature of the experiment meant that the supercurrents were confined to the surface of the C60 crystal, rather than probing the bulk.) Here we report the discovery of bulk superconductivity in magnesium diboride, MgB2. Magnetization and resistivity measurements establish a transition temperature of 39{\thinspace}K, which we believe to be the highest yet determined for a non-copper-oxide bulk superconductor.},

ABSTRACT={The search for room temperature superconductivity has accelerated in the last few years driven by experimentally accessible theoretical predictions that indicated alloying dense hydrogen with other elements could produce conventional superconductivity at high temperatures and pressures. These predictions helped inform the synthesis of simple binary hydrides that culminated in the discovery of the superhydride LaH<sub>10</sub> with a superconducting transition temperature T<sub>c</sub> of 260 K at 180 GPa. We have now successfully synthesized a metallic La-based superhydride with an initial T<sub>c</sub> of 294 K. When subjected to subsequent thermal excursions that promoted a chemical reaction to a higher order system, the T<sub>c</sub> onset was driven irreversibly to 556 K. X-ray characterization confirmed the formation of a distorted LaH<sub>10</sub> based backbone that suggests the formation of ternary or quaternary compounds with substitution at the La and/or H sites. The results provide evidence for hot superconductivity, aligning with recent predictions for higher order hydrides under pressure.}

abstract = {Abstract Pressure-stabilized hydrides are a new rapidly growing class of high-temperature superconductors, which is believed to be described within the conventional phonon-mediated mechanism of coupling. Here, the synthesis of one of the best-known high-TC superconductors—yttrium hexahydride Im3¯m-YH6 is reported, which displays a superconducting transition at ≈224 K at 166 GPa. The extrapolated upper critical magnetic field Bc2(0) of YH6 is surprisingly high: 116–158 T, which is 2–2.5 times larger than the calculated value. A pronounced shift of TC in yttrium deuteride YD6 with the isotope coefficient 0.4 supports the phonon-assisted superconductivity. Current–voltage measurements show that the critical current IC and its density JC may exceed 1.75 A and 3500 A mm−2 at 4 K, respectively, which is higher than that of the commercial superconductors, such as NbTi and YBCO. The results of superconducting density functional theory (SCDFT) and anharmonic calculations, together with anomalously high critical magnetic field, suggest notable departures of the superconducting properties from the conventional Migdal–Eliashberg and Bardeen–Cooper–Schrieffer theories, and presence of an additional mechanism of superconductivity.},

Superconductivity was evidenced by the observation of zero resistance and a decrease of TC under external magnetic field up to 16 Tesla. This is one of the highest critical temperatures that has been achieved experimentally in any compound, along with such materials as LaH10, H3S and HgBa2CaxCu2O6+z. Our experiments show that fcc-ThH10 has stabilization pressure of 85 GPa, making this material unique among all known high-TC metal polyhydrides. Two recently predicted Th-H compounds, I4/mmm-ThH4 (>86 GPa) and Cmc21-ThH6 (86–104 GPa), were also synthesized. Equations of state of obtained thorium polyhydrides were measured and found to be in excellent agreement with the theoretical calculations. New phases were examined theoretically and their electronic, phonon, and superconducting properties were calculated.}

abstract={With the discovery1 of superconductivity at 203 kelvin in H3S, attention returned to conventional superconductors with properties that can be described by the Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer and the Migdal--Eliashberg theories. Although these theories predict the possibility of room-temperature superconductivity in metals that have certain favourable properties---such as lattice vibrations at high frequencies---they are not sufficient to guide the design or predict the properties of new superconducting materials. First-principles calculations based on density functional theory have enabled such predictions, and have suggested a new family of superconducting hydrides that possess a clathrate-like structure in which the host atom (calcium, yttrium, lanthanum) is at the centre of a cage formed by hydrogen atoms2--4. For LaH10 and YH10, the onset of superconductivity is predicted to occur at critical temperatures between 240 and 320 kelvin at megabar pressures3--6. Here we report superconductivity with a critical temperature of around 250 kelvin within the {\$}{\$}Fm{\backslash}bar{\{}{\{}{\backslash}bf{\{}3{\}}{\}}{\}}m{\$}{\$}structure of LaH10 at a pressure of about 170 gigapascals. This is, to our knowledge, the highest critical temperature that has been confirmed so far in a superconducting material. Superconductivity was evidenced by the observation of zero resistance, an isotope effect, and a decrease in critical temperature under an external magnetic field, which suggested an upper critical magnetic field of about 136 tesla at zero temperature. The increase of around 50 kelvin compared with the previous highest critical temperature1 is an encouraging step towards the goal of achieving room-temperature superconductivity in the near future.},

The mechanism underlying superconductivity in these exceptional compounds is the conventional electron–phonon coupling. Here we describe recent advances in experimental techniques, superconductivity theory and first-principles computational methods which have made possible these discoveries. This work aims to provide an up-to-date compendium of the available results on superconducting hydrides and explain how the synergy of different methodologies led to extraordinary discoveries in the field. Besides, in an attempt to evidence empirical rules governing superconductivity in binary hydrides under pressure, we discuss general trends in the electronic structure and chemical bonding. The last part of the Review introduces possible strategies to optimize pressure and transition temperatures in conventional superconducting materials as well as future directions in theoretical, computational and experimental research.}

We present the theoretical background of RPA in an intuitive rather than formal fashion, focusing on the physical picture of screening and simple diagrammatic analysis. A new decomposition of the RPA correlation energy into plasmonic modes leads to an appealing visualization of electron correlation in terms of charge density fluctuations. Recent developments in the areas of beyond-RPA methods, RPA correlation potentials, and efficient algorithms for RPA energy and property calculations are reviewed. The ability of RPA to approximately capture static correlation in molecules is quantified by an analysis of RPA natural occupation numbers. We illustrate the use of RPA methods in applications to small-gap systems such as open-shell d- and f-element compounds, radicals, and weakly bound complexes, where semilocal density functional results exhibit strong functional dependence. }

abstract = {We present a new interatomic potential for solids and liquids called Spectral Neighbor Analysis Potential (SNAP). The SNAP potential has a very general form and uses machine-learning techniques to reproduce the energies, forces, and stress tensors of a large set of small configurations of atoms, which are obtained using high-accuracy quantum electronic structure (QM) calculations. The local environment of each atom is characterized by a set of bispectrum components of the local neighbor density projected onto a basis of hyperspherical harmonics in four dimensions. The bispectrum components are the same bond-orientational order parameters employed by the GAP potential [1]. The SNAP potential, unlike GAP, assumes a linear relationship between atom energy and bispectrum components. The linear SNAP coefficients are determined using weighted least-squares linear regression against the full QM training set. This allows the SNAP potential to be fit in a robust, automated manner to large QM data sets using many bispectrum components. The calculation of the bispectrum components and the SNAP potential are implemented in the LAMMPS parallel molecular dynamics code. We demonstrate that a previously unnoticed symmetry property can be exploited to reduce the computational cost of the force calculations by more than one order of magnitude. We present results for a SNAP potential for tantalum, showing that it accurately reproduces a range of commonly calculated properties of both the crystalline solid and the liquid phases. In addition, unlike simpler existing potentials, SNAP correctly predicts the energy barrier for screw dislocation migration in BCC tantalum.}

From an analysis of molecular-dynamics simulations of the structural fluctuations in the cubic phase close to the transition temperature, we show that the cubic-to-tetragonal transition is displacive. In addition, the discontinuous change in volume and the latent heat at the transition demonstrate clearly that the transition is first order. The model correctly predicts that doping with yttria tends to stabilize the cubic phase at lower temperatures. A description of the first-order nature of dopant-driven transitions is given.},

It is not yet clear, however, how accurately they describe anharmonic properties, which are crucial for predicting the lattice thermal conductivity and phase transitions in solids and, thus, shape their technological applications. Here we employ a recently developed on-the-fly learning technique based on molecular dynamics and Bayesian inference in order to generate an interatomic potential capable to describe the thermodynamic properties of zirconia, an important transition metal oxide. This machine-learned potential accurately captures the temperature-induced phase transitions below the melting point. We further showcase the predictive power of the potential by calculating the heat transport on the basis of Green-Kubo theory, which allows to account for anharmonic effects to all orders. This study indicates that machine-learned potentials trained on the fly offer a routine solution for accurate and efficient simulations of the thermodynamic properties of a vast class of anharmonic materials.},

abstract={Computational modeling of chemical and biological systems at atomic resolution is a crucial tool in the chemist’s toolset. The use of computer simulations requires a balance between cost and accuracy: quantum-mechanical methods provide high accuracy but are computationally expensive and scale poorly to large systems, while classical force fields are cheap and scalable, but lack transferability to new systems. Machine learning can be used to achieve the best of both approaches. Here we train a general-purpose neural network potential (ANI-1ccx) that approaches CCSD(T)/CBS accuracy on benchmarks for reaction thermochemistry, isomerization, and drug-like molecular torsions. This is achieved by training a network to DFT data then using transfer learning techniques to retrain on a dataset of gold standard QM calculations (CCSD(T)/CBS) that optimally spans chemical space. The resulting potential is broadly applicable to materials science, biology, and chemistry, and billions of times faster than CCSD(T)/CBS calculations.},

However, the predictive power of these simulations is only as good as the underlying interatomic potential. Classical potentials often fail to faithfully capture key quantum effects in molecules and materials. Here we enable the direct construction of flexible molecular force fields from high-level ab initio calculations by incorporating spatial and temporal physical symmetries into a gradient-domain machine learning (sGDML) model in an automatic data-driven way. The developed sGDML approach faithfully reproduces global force fields at quantum-chemical CCSD(T) level of accuracy and allows converged molecular dynamics simulations with fully quantized electrons and nuclei. We present MD simulations, for flexible molecules with up to a few dozen atoms and provide insights into the dynamical behavior of these molecules. Our approach provides the key missing ingredient for achieving spectroscopic accuracy in molecular simulations.},

We provide a comprehensive overview and analysis of the most recent research in this topic. As a starting point, we introduce machine learning principles, algorithms, descriptors, and databases in materials science. We continue with the description of different machine learning approaches for the discovery of stable materials and the prediction of their crystal structure. Then we discuss research in numerous quantitative structure�Cproperty relationships and various approaches for the replacement of first-principle methods by machine learning. We review how active learning and surrogate-based optimization can be applied to improve the rational design process and related examples of applications. Two major questions are always the interpretability of and the physical understanding gained from machine learning models. We consider therefore the different facets of interpretability and their importance in materials science. Finally, we propose solutions and future research paths for various challenges in computational materials science.},

	abstract = {Lattice dynamical methods used to predict phase transformations in crystals typically deal with harmonic phonon spectra and are therefore not applicable in important situations where one of the competing crystal structures is unstable in the harmonic approximation, such as the bcc structure involved in the hcp-to-bcc martensitic phase transformation in Ti, Zr and Hf. Here we present an expression for the free energy that does not suffer from such shortcomings, and we show by self-consistent ab initio lattice dynamical calculations (SCAILD), that the critical temperature for the hcp-to-bcc phase transformation in Ti, Zr and Hf, can be effectively calculated from the free-energy difference between the two phases. This opens up the possibility to study quantitatively, from first-principles theory, temperature-induced phase transitions.}

The form of this universal function is determined by sealing experimental compression data for measured isotherms of a wide variety of solids. The equation of state is thus known (in the absence of phase transitions), if zero-pressure volume and isothermal compression and its pressure derivative are known. The discovery described by the authors has two immediate consequences: first, despite the well known differences in the microscopic energetics of the various classes of solids, there is a single equation of state for all classes in compression; and second, a new method is provided for analysing measured isotherms and extrapolating high-pressure data from low-pressure (e.g. acoustic) data.}

abstract = {Abstract Modern simulation techniques have reached a level of maturity which allows a wide range of problems in chemistry and materials science to be addressed. Unfortunately, the application of first principles methods with predictive power is still limited to rather small systems, and despite the rapid evolution of computer hardware no fundamental change in this situation can be expected. Consequently, the development of more efficient but equally reliable atomistic potentials to reach an atomic level understanding of complex systems has received considerable attention in recent years. A promising new development has been the introduction of machine learning (ML) methods to describe the atomic interactions. Once trained with electronic structure data, ML potentials can accelerate computer simulations by several orders of magnitude, while preserving quantum mechanical accuracy. This Review considers the methodology of an important class of ML potentials that employs artificial neural networks.},

abstract = {The high-temperature structure of zirconia was studied by powder neutron diffraction up to 2400°C. The boundaries of the domain of the nonstoichiometric tetragonal form are defined. They are consistent with a tetragonal-cubic transition at 2350°C for stoichiometric zirconia. The changes in the structural parameters of the tetragonal form (unit-cell, positional parameters and thermal B factors) with temperature give evidence of medium zirconium and oxygen mobilities. The oxygen ions are, however, always more mobile than the zirconium ions. An enhancement with temperature of the structural an-isotropy tends to weaken the weaker of the two distinct Zr-0 bonds of the tetragonal zirconia. It results in the transformation into the cubic form which is accompanied by a change in unit-cell volume; this change becomes sharper as the composition tends toward stoichiometry. This transition is probably followed by an increase of the ionic mobility.},

Here we show that the relative equilibrium between liquid gallium, ��-Ga, ��-Ga, and Ga-II is well described. The resulting phase diagram is in agreement with the experimental findings. The local structure of liquid gallium and its nucleation into ��-Ga and ��-Ga are studied. We find that the formation of metastable ��-Ga is kinetically favored over the thermodinamically stable ��-Ga. Finally, we provide insight into the experimental observations of extreme undercooling of liquid Ga.},

Our model is fitted to density-functional theory plus many-body dispersion (DFT?+?MBD) data; its accuracy is demonstrated for the exfoliation of black and violet phosphorus (yielding monolayers of ��phosphorene�� and ��hittorfene��); its transferability is shown for the transition between the molecular and network liquid phases. An application to a phosphorene nanoribbon on an experimentally relevant length scale exemplifies the power of accurate and flexible ML-driven force fields for next-generation materials modelling. The methodology promises new insights into phosphorus as well as other structurally complex, e.g., layered solids that are relevant in diverse areas of chemistry, physics, and materials science.},

The axial ratio c/a increases with increasing pressure for α-Zr, but it is nearly invariant under compression for ω-Zr. Within the quasi-harmonic Debye model, the full phase diagram of Zr was obtained. The zero pressure phase transition from α-Zr to β-Zr occurs at 1130K. The transition pressure from α-Zr to ω-Zr at 300K is 2.10GPa and the predicted triple point is at 6.35GPa, 910K, which is close to the experimental data. The thermal properties including the entropy, isotherm, isobar and thermal pressure in a wide range of pressure and temperature were predicted successfully."

Principal applications for zirconium alloys are in the nuclear and chemical process industries (CPI). Zirconium is also used in photo-flash applications and as a getter for oxygen and other gases. The development of high strength zirconium alloys is described with particular reference to nuclear applications."

The main properties which make the metal attractive in use are its high strength when alloyed with other materials, its outstanding corrosion resistance. This metal preferable in industrial, marine and other environments, good metallurgical workability and superior fatigue resistance. For upcoming originations tough ceramics and its oxide compound, Zirconia, also known as zirconium dioxide, ZrO2 has become a base material. For fiber reinforcement also the ceramics are applicable and recently several latest ceramic fabrication techniques are investigated. This review is a collection of details regarding the physical properties, mechanical properties, fabrication and procurement of zirconium and its based materials. The material zirconium and its alloys have excellent corrosion �?radiation-resistance properties and so that it can be used as nuclear reactor core materials such as fuel cladding and guide tubes. The experimental results on manufacturing of ceramics using Aluminum oxide with a regular structure which gives high strengthening properties and the extensive usage in different streams of technology were investigated. With the highly disperse powders new ceramic materials having a high strength were found out."

The equilibrium phase boundary of the α–�?transition has a dT/dP slope of 473K/GPa, and the extrapolated transition pressure at ambient temperature is located at 3.4GPa. For the ω–�?transition, the phase boundary has a negative dT/dP slope of 15.5K/GPa between 6.4 and 15.3GPa, which is substantially smaller than a previously reported value of �?9±5K/GPa in the pressure range of 32�?5GPa. This difference indicates a significant curvature of the phase boundary between 15.3 and 35GPa. The α–ω–�?triple point was estimated to be at 4.9GPa and 953K, which is comparable to previous results obtained from a differential thermal analysis. Except for the three known crystalline forms, the β phase of zirconium metal was found to possess an extraordinary glass forming ability at pressures between 6.4 and 8.6GPa. This transformation leads to a limited stability field for the β phase in the pressure range of 6�?6GPa and to complications of high-temperature portion of phase diagram for zirconium metal."

Unfortunately, being linear combinations of up to all the data points, these vectors are notoriously difficult to interpret in terms of the data and processes generating the data. In this article, we develop CUR matrix decompositions for improved data analysis. CUR decompositions are low-rank matrix decompositions that are explicitly expressed in terms of a small number of actual columns and/or actual rows of the data matrix. Because they are constructed from actual data elements, CUR decompositions are interpretable by practitioners of the field from which the data are drawn (to the extent that the original data are). We present an algorithm that preferentially chooses columns and rows that exhibit high {\textquotedblleft}statistical leverage{\textquotedblright} and, thus, in a very precise statistical sense, exert a disproportionately large {\textquotedblleft}influence{\textquotedblright} on the best low-rank fit of the data matrix. By selecting columns and rows in this manner, we obtain improved relative-error and constant-factor approximation guarantees in worst-case analysis, as opposed to the much coarser additive-error guarantees of prior work. In addition, since the construction involves computing quantities with a natural and widely studied statistical interpretation, we can leverage ideas from diagnostic regression analysis to employ these matrix decompositions for exploratory data analysis.},

The one-phonon deuterium optical band in the INS spectrum was observed at an energy transfer of 107 meV (with the main feature at 103.4 meV), which is higher than the deuterium vibrational energies for all other phases of the Zr-D system. Distinct features were also observed in the INS spectrum below the free multiphonon bands, which were explained as the bound multiphonon states.}

	journal = {Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter},

	abstract = {Recently, two nonempirical hybrid functionals, dielectric-dependent range-separated hybrid functional based on the Coulomb-attenuating method (DD-RSH-CAM) and doubly screened hybrid functional (DSH), have been suggested by Chen et al (2018 Phys. Rev. Mater. 2 073803) and Cui et al (2018 J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 9 2338), respectively. These two hybrid functionals are both based on a common model dielectric function approach, but differ in the way how to non-empirically obtain the range-separation parameter. By retaining the full short-range Fock exchange and a fraction of the long-range Fock exchange that equals the inverse of the dielectric constant, both DD-RSH-CAM and DSH turn out to perform very well in predicting the band gaps for a large variety of semiconductors and insulators. Here, we assess how these two hybrid functionals perform on challenging antiferromagnetic transition-metal monoxides MnO, FeO, CoO, and NiO by comparing them to other conventional hybrid functionals and the GW method. We find that single-shot DD0-RSH-CAM and DSH0 improve the band gaps towards experiments as compared to conventional hybrid functionals. The magnetic moments are slightly increased, but the predicted dielectric constants are decreased. The valence band density of states (DOS) predicted by DD0-RSH-CAM and DSH0 are as satisfactory as HSE03 in comparison to experimental spectra, however, the conduction band DOS are shifted to higher energies by about 2�eV compared to HSE03. Self-consistent DD-RSH-CAM and DSH deteriorate the results with a significant overestimation of band gaps.}

In this context 5d oxides provide new paradigms of cooperative interactions that drive novel emergent behaviour. This is exemplified in osmates that host metal�Cinsulator transitions where magnetic order appears intimately entwined. Here we consider such a material, the 5d perovskite NaOsO3, and observe a coupling between spin and phonon manifested in a frequency shift of 40?cm?1, the largest measured in any material. The anomalous modes are shown to involve solely Os�CO interactions and magnetism is revealed as the driving microscopic mechanism for the phonon renormalization. The magnitude of the coupling in NaOsO3 is primarily due to a property common to all 5d materials: the large spatial extent of the ion. This allows magnetism to couple to phonons on an unprecedented scale and in general offers multiple new routes to enhanced coupled phenomena in 5d materials.},

abstract = {{\it AMPLIMODES} is a computer program available on the Bilbao Crystallographic Server that can perform a symmetry-mode analysis of any distorted structure of displacive type. The analysis consists in decomposing the symmetry-breaking distortion present in the distorted structure into contributions from different symmetry-adapted modes. Given the high- and the low-symmetry structures, {\it AMPLIMODES} determines the atomic displacements that relate them, defines a basis of symmetry-adapted modes, and calculates the amplitudes and polarization vectors of the distortion modes of different symmetry frozen in the structure. The program uses a mode parameterization that is as close as possible to the crystallographic conventions, expressing all quantities for the asymmetric unit of the low-symmetry structure. Distorted structures are often related to their higher-symmetry counterparts by temperature- and/or pressure-driven phase transitions, ferroic phase transitions being a particular example. The automatic symmetry-mode analysis performed by {\it AMPLIMODES} can be very useful for establishing the driving mechanisms of such structural phase transitions or the fundamental instabilities at the origin of the distorted phases.},

   title = {Developing an interatomic potential for martensitic phase transformations in zirconium by machine learning},
   journal = {npj Computational Materials},
   volume = {4},
   number = {1},
   pages = {48},
   abstract = {Atomic simulations provide an effective means to understand the underlying physics of structural phase transformations. However, this remains a challenge for certain allotropic metals due to the failure of classical interatomic potentials to represent the multitude of bonding. Based on machine-learning (ML) techniques, we develop a hybrid method in which interatomic potentials describing martensitic transformations can be learned with a high degree of fidelity from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations (AIMD). Using zirconium as a model system, for which an adequate semiempirical potential describing the phase transformation process is lacking, we demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of our approach. Specifically, the ML-AIMD interatomic potential correctly captures the energetics and structural transformation properties of zirconium as compared to experimental and density-functional data for phonons, elastic constants, as well as stacking fault energies. Molecular dynamics simulations successfully reproduce the transformation mechanisms and reasonably map out the pressure�Ctemperature phase diagram of zirconium.},
