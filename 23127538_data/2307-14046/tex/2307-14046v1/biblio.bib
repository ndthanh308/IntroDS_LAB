abstract  ="Surface segregation in bimetallic nanoparticles (NPs) is critically important for their catalytic activity because the activity is largely determined by the surface composition. Little{,} however{,} is known about the atomic scale mechanisms and kinetics of surface segregation. One reason is that it is hard to resolve atomic rearrangements experimentally. It is also difficult to model surface segregation at the atomic scale because the atomic rearrangements can take place on time scales of seconds or minutes – much longer than can be modeled with molecular dynamics. Here we use the adaptive kinetic Monte Carlo (AKMC) method to model the segregation dynamics in PdAu NPs over experimentally relevant time scales{,} and reveal the origin of kinetic stability of the core@shell and random alloy NPs at the atomic level. Our focus on PdAu NPs is motivated by experimental work showing that both core@shell and random alloy PdAu NPs with diameters of less than 2 nm are stable{,} indicating that one of these structures must be metastable and kinetically trapped. Our simulations show that both the Au@Pd and the PdAu random alloy NPs are metastable and kinetically trapped below 400 K over time scales of hours. These AKMC simulations provide insight into the energy landscape of the two NP structures{,} and the diffusion mechanisms that lead to segregation. In the core–shell NP{,} surface segregation occurs primarily on the (100) facet through both a vacancy-mediated and a concerted mechanism. The system becomes kinetically trapped when all corner sites in the core of the NP are occupied by Pd atoms. Higher energy barriers are required for further segregation{,} so that the metastable NP has a partially alloyed shell. In contrast{,} surface segregation in the random alloy PdAu NP is suppressed because the random alloy NP has reduced strain as compared to the Au@Pd NP{,} and the segregation mechanisms in the alloy require more elastic energy for exchange of Pd and Au and between the surface and subsurface."}

The peculiarity lies in the variety of shapes often unusual and far from any geometrical and crystallographic intuition clusters can assume. In this respect, we should treat and consider nanoparticles as a new form of matter. Nanoparticle structures depend on their size, chemical composition, ordering, as well as external conditions e.g. synthesis method, pressure, temperature, support. On top of that, at finite temperatures nanoparticles can fluctuate among different structures, opening new and exciting horizons for the design of optimal nanoparticles for advanced applications. This article aims to overview geometrical features of transition metal clusters and of their various rearrangements.},

abstract  ="Nanomaterials have emerged as an amazing class of materials that consists of a broad spectrum of examples with at least one dimension in the range of 1 to 100 nm. Exceptionally high surface areas can be achieved through the rational design of nanomaterials. Nanomaterials can be produced with outstanding magnetic{,} electrical{,} optical{,} mechanical{,} and catalytic properties that are substantially different from their bulk counterparts. The nanomaterial properties can be tuned as desired via precisely controlling the size{,} shape{,} synthesis conditions{,} and appropriate functionalization. This review discusses a brief history of nanomaterials and their use throughout history to trigger advances in nanotechnology development. In particular{,} we describe and define various terms relating to nanomaterials. Various nanomaterial synthesis methods{,} including top-down and bottom-up approaches{,} are discussed. The unique features of nanomaterials are highlighted throughout the review. This review describes advances in nanomaterials{,} specifically fullerenes{,} carbon nanotubes{,} graphene{,} carbon quantum dots{,} nanodiamonds{,} carbon nanohorns{,} nanoporous materials{,} core–shell nanoparticles{,} silicene{,} antimonene{,} MXenes{,} 2D MOF nanosheets{,} boron nitride nanosheets{,} layered double hydroxides{,} and metal-based nanomaterials.

It was recently observed that supported metal catalysts could be directly obtained upon ball milling from the coarse powders of metal and oxide support. Moreover, when two compatible metal sources are simultaneously subjected to the mechanochemical treatment, bimetallic nanoparticles are obtained. A systematic investigation was extended to different metals and supports to understand better the mechanisms involved in the comminution and alloying of metal nanoparticles. Based on this, a model describing the role of metal-support interactions in the synthesis was developed. The findings will be helpful for the future rational design of supported metal catalysts via dry ball milling.},

abstract  ="Coalescence is a phenomenon in which two or more nanoparticles merge to form a single larger aggregate. By means of gas-phase magnetron-sputtering aggregation experiments on Pt–Pd nanoalloys{,} it is shown that the degree of coalescence can be tuned from a growth regime in which coalescence is negligible to a regime where the growth outcome is dominated by coalescence events. This transition is achieved by varying both the length of the aggregation zone and the pressure difference between the aggregation and the deposition chamber. In the coalescence-dominated regime{,} a wide variety of coalescing aggregates is produced and analyzed by TEM. The experimental results are interpreted with the aid of molecular-dynamics simulations. This allows to distinguish four different steps through which coalescence proceeds towards equilibrium. These steps{,} occurring on a hierarchy of well-separated time scales{,} consist in: (i) alignment of atomic columns; (ii) alignment of close-packed atomic planes; (iii) equilibration of shape; (iv) equilibration of chemical ordering."}

In order to address this issue, we have simulated the formation of trimetallic Au/Ir/Pd nanoalloys in gas-phase condensation. We have analysed the effect of the Au mole fraction on the structural and thermodynamic properties of the nanoclusters formed during the condensation process using MD simulation. Our stability examinations have shown that an increase of Au concentration in the Pd-Ir nanoalloy is favourable and leads to the formation of a more stable cluster. Also, we observed that the Ir atoms prefer to lie at the nanoalloy cores, but the Au and Pd atoms lie at the nanoclusters surface. The surface energy of clusters also decreases as the Au concentration increases. Also, an increase of Au atoms in the nanoalloys can increase the cluster size. The results of the structural investigations using RDF showed that a core-shell morphology has not been formed during this condensation. Some ordered structures (including fcc-like and hcp-like structures) were formed in the nanoclusters in the condensation technique. The thermal evolution study showed that the nanoalloys become more spherical by increasing the temperature. Also, the surface Ir atoms decrease with increasing temperature whereas the number of surface Au and Pd atoms vary with the temperature. We have also derived an expression for the statistical probability of formation of a three-component nanocluster.}

abstract  ="Among the properties that distinguish nanoparticles (NPs) from their bulk counterparts is their lower melting points. It is also common knowledge that relatively low melting points enhance the coalescence of (usually) nascent nanoclusters toward larger NPs. Finally{,} it is well established that the chemical ordering of bi- (or multi-) metallic NPs can have a profound effect on their physical and chemical properties{,} dictating their potential applications. With these three considerations in mind{,} we investigated the coalescence mechanisms for Ni and Pt NPs of various configurations using classical molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations. Benchmarking the coalescence process{,} we identified a steeper melting point depression for Pt than for Ni{,} which indicates a reversal in the order of melting for same-size NPs of the two elements. This reversal{,} also evident in the nano-phase diagram thermodynamically constructed using the regular solution model{,} may be useful for utilising NP coalescence as a means to design and engineer non-equilibrium NPs via gas-phase synthesis. Indeed{,} our MD simulations revealed different coalescence mechanisms at play depending on the conditions{,} leading to segregated chemical orderings such as quasi-Janus core-satellite{,} or core–(partial) shell NPs{,} despite the expected theoretical tendency for elemental mixing."}

Therefore, more thoughtful considerations are required on various hierarchy-related issues in their design and synthesis, especially when deciding their composition, mass, activity, selectivity, reactivity, stability, surface, texture, porosity, structure, size, shape, density, and even cost for a system under development. In this Concept article, we will address some general considerations and approaches with respect to the design and synthesis of nanocatalysts. In particular, architectural conceivability, materials selection, synthetic technique and integration strategy will be discussed. Furthermore, we will use the development of integrated nanocatalysts as examples to highlight some key hierarchical issues and snapshot a few representative practices. Finally, a number of suggestions regarding future research directions are also proposed on the basis of personal perspective.},

The catalytic properties of well-controlled NMNs are discussed. Finally, the major challenges and opportunities pertaining to the controllable synthesis of NMNs are presented.

ABSTRACT = {Due to their peculiar qualities, metal-based nanostructures have been extensively used in applications such as catalysis, electronics, photography, and information storage, among others. New applications for metals in areas such as photonics, sensing, imaging, and medicine are also being developed. Significantly, most of these applications require the use of metals in the form of nanostructures with specific controlled properties. The properties of nanoscale metals are determined by a set of physical parameters that include size, shape, composition, and structure. In recent years, many research fields have focused on the synthesis of nanoscale-sized metallic materials with complex shape and composition in order to optimize the optical and electrical response of devices containing metallic nanostructures. The present paper aims to overview the most recent results—in terms of fabrication methodologies, characterization of the physico-chemical properties and applications—of complex-morphology metal-based nanostructures. The paper strongly focuses on the correlation between the complex morphology and the structures’ properties, showing how the morphological complexity (and its nanoscale control) can often give access to a wide range of innovative properties exploitable for innovative functional device production. We begin with an overview of the basic concepts on the correlation between structural and optical parameters of nanoscale metallic materials with complex shape and composition, and the possible solutions offered by nanotechnology in a large range of applications (catalysis, electronics, photonics, sensing). The aim is to assess the state of the art, and then show the innovative contributions that can be proposed in this research field. We subsequently report on innovative, versatile and low-cost synthesis techniques, suitable for providing a good control on the size, surface density, composition and geometry of the metallic nanostructures. The main purpose of this study is the fabrication of functional nanoscale-sized materials, whose properties can be tailored (in a wide range) simply by controlling the structural characteristics. The modulation of the structural parameters is required to tune the plasmonic properties of the nanostructures for applications such as biosensors, opto-electronic or photovoltaic devices and surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) substrates. The structural characterization of the obtained nanoscale materials is employed in order to define how the synthesis parameters affect the structural characteristics of the resulting metallic nanostructures. Then, macroscopic measurements are used to probe their electrical and optical properties. Phenomenological growth models are drafted to explain the processes involved in the growth and evolution of such composite systems. After the synthesis and characterization of the metallic nanostructures, we study the effects of the incorporation of the complex morphologies on the optical and electrical responses of each specific device.},

abstract  ="We propose an approach to accelerate the computational exploration and the prediction of the preferred chemical ordering in alloy nanoparticles. This approach{,} named Grouping Global Optimization (GGO){,} is based on grouping atoms into equivalence sets constrained to be occupied by the same elemental species{,} with a consequent significant reduction in the compositional degrees of freedom of the system. The equivalence sets are defined on the basis of point group symmetry or in general of any given order parameter{,} thus leaving the user a great freedom in the implementation to each specific system. The GGO approach can be used within both systematic and stochastic sampling algorithms as demonstrated by tests conducted on prototypical nanoalloys{,} namely on Pd–Pt and Ag–Cu binary pairs{,} as representative of high- or low-miscibility alloys{,} respectively{,} and on particles of two different sizes{,} i.e.{,} truncated octahedra composed of 586 and 4033 atoms. It is found that GGO enables an extremely quick scan of the chemical ordering in nanoalloys containing thousands of atoms and to predict low-energy chemical ordering patterns as a function of size and composition with a modest computational effort even for the larger and symmetry-broken particles. The strategy here proposed should be applicable equally well in other fields than that of nanoalloys."}

abstract = {Over the past decade, there has been a significant growth in the development and application of methods for performing global optimization (GO) of cluster and nanoparticle structures using first-principles electronic structure methods coupled to sophisticated search algorithms. This has in part been driven by the desire to avoid the use of empirical potentials (EPs), especially in cases where no reliable potentials exist to guide the search toward reasonable regions of configuration space. This has been facilitated by improvements in the reliability of the search algorithms, increased efficiency of the electronic structure methods, and the development of faster, multiprocessor high-performance computing architectures. In this review, we give a brief overview of GO algorithms, though concentrating mainly on genetic algorithm and basin hopping techniques, first in combination with EPs. The major part of the review then deals with details of the implementation and application of these search methods to allow exploration for global minimum cluster structures directly using electronic structure methods and, in particular, density functional theory. Example applications are presented, ranging from isolated monometallic and bimetallic clusters to molecular clusters and ligated and surface supported metal clusters. Finally, some possible future developments are highlighted. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

In materials science, the discovery of recipes that yield nanomaterials with defined optical properties is costly and time-consuming. In this study, we present a two-step framework for a machine learning-driven high-throughput microfluidic platform to rapidly produce silver nanoparticles with the desired absorbance spectrum. Combining a Gaussian process-based Bayesian optimization (BO) with a deep neural network (DNN), the algorithmic framework is able to converge towards the target spectrum after sampling 120 conditions. Once the dataset is large enough to train the DNN with sufficient accuracy in the region of the target spectrum, the DNN is used to predict the colour palette accessible with the reaction synthesis. While remaining interpretable by humans, the proposed framework efficiently optimizes the nanomaterial synthesis and can extract fundamental knowledge of the relationship between chemical composition and optical properties, such as the role of each reactant on the shape and amplitude of the absorbance spectrum.},

Important metrics for the stability of nanostructures include the chemical potential of supported nanoparticles, cohesive energies of nanoparticles, surface and adhesion energies of crystal planes that bound the nanoparticle, and segregation energies in bimetallic nanoparticles. Ab initio methods can calculate these metrics but are computationally intensive due to the large configurational space that these nanostructures span. Moreover, sub-nanometer nanoparticles are structurally flexibile under reaction conditions. Hence, physics-based and machine-learning-derived data-driven approaches are becoming prevalent to determine the stability of nanostructures. In this review we discuss the recent advances in data-driven methods to predict stability metrics of nanoparticles.}

ABSTRACT={Electrocatalysis plays a key role in clean energy innovation. In order to design more efficient, durable and selective electrocatalysts, a thorough understanding of the unique link between 3D structures and properties is essential yet challenging. Advanced 3D electron tomography offers an effective approach to reveal 3D structures by transmission electron microscopy. This mini-review summarizes recent progress on revealing 3D structures of electrocatalysts using 3D electron tomography. 3D electron tomography at nanoscale and atomic scale are discussed, respectively, where morphology, composition, porous structure, surface crystallography and atomic distribution can be revealed and correlated to the performance of electrocatalysts. (Quasi) in-situ 3D electron tomography is further discussed with particular focus on its impact on electrocatalysts’ durability investigation and post-treatment. Finally, perspectives on future developments of 3D electron tomography for eletrocatalysis is discussed.}

Unfortunately{,} the applicability of EDX tomography is severely limited because of extremely long acquisition times and high electron irradiation doses required to obtain 3D EDX reconstructions with an adequate signal-to-noise ratio. One possibility to address this limitation is intelligent denoising of experimental data using prior expectations about the objects of interest. Herein{,} this approach is followed using the deep learning methodology{,} which currently demonstrates state-of-the-art performance for an increasing number of data processing problems. Design choices for the denoising approach and training data are discussed with a focus on nanoparticle-like objects and extremely noisy signals typical for EDX experiments. Quantitative analysis of the proposed method demonstrates its significantly enhanced performance in comparison to classical denoising approaches. This allows for improving the tradeoff between the reconstruction quality{,} acquisition time and radiation dose for EDX tomography. The proposed method is therefore especially beneficial for the 3D EDX investigation of electron beam-sensitive materials and studies of nanoparticle transformations."}

These effects and the corresponding potential applications are illustrated using some selected examples: new diamond-like carbon films produced by fullerene depositions (memory effect) and grain effect on the magnetic properties of cluster-assembled transition metal films. }
