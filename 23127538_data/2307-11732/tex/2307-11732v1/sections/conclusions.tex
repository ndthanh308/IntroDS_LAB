\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

Online learning algorithms can serve as effective tools in modeling bidders in complex ad auctions. We showed that soft floors can have a positive effect on the ad service's revenue, even in an ex-ante symmetric environment. We also demonstrated that the algorithm choice can significantly affect the learning rate in a more realistic auction environments, especially with a large number of bidders.
Utilizing our simulation approach, we further inferred bidders' valuations in the presence of more realistic auction rules. This has been experimented with aggregated bid data from an e-commerce website for both low- and high-density auctions.
