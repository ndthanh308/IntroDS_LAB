\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}

We demonstrated that online learning algorithms can serve as effective tools in modeling bidders in complex ad auctions where  it is not feasible to solve for equilibrium behavior. We showed that soft floors can have a positive effect on the ad service's revenue, even in an ex-ante symmetric environment, provided values and click-through rates are query-dependent, but yield lower revenue than aptly chosen standard reserve prices in single-query environments with a dominant bidder. We also documented that the algorithm choice can significantly affect the learning rate in a more realistic auction environments, especially with a large number of bidders.
Utilizing our simulation approach, we also showed how to infer bidders' valuations in the presence of more realistic auction rules. We demonstrated this using aggregate bid data from an e-commerce website in both low- and high-density auctions.
