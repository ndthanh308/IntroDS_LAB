  "abstract": "We propose a new algorithm for variance reduction when estimating $f(X_T)$ where $X$ is the solution to some stochastic differential equation and $f$ is a test function. The new estimator is $(f(X^1_T) + f(X^2_T))/2$, where $X^1$ and $X^2$ have same marginal law as $X$ but are pathwise correlated so that to reduce the variance. The optimal correlation function $ρ$ is approximated by a deep neural network and is calibrated along the trajectories of $(X^1, X^2)$ by policy gradient and reinforcement learning techniques. Finding an optimal coupling given marginal laws has links with maximum optimal transport.",
