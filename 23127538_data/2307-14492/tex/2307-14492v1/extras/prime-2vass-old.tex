Assume by way of contradiction that $\cP$ is not prime. Thus, there exist 1-VASSes $\cV_1,\ldots \cV_k$ such that $\bigcap_{1 \leq i \leq k}\lang(\cV_i)=\lang(\cA)$.

Throughout the proof, we focus on words of the form $a^{m_1}\#a^{m_2}\#\cdots\#a^{m_{k+1}}\#b^{m_b}c^{m_c}$, for some integers $\left\{m_i\right\}_{i=1}^{k+1},m_b,m_c \in \bbN$. In all such words - we enumerate the segments of $a$'s and discuss a word's first segment, second segment, etc. Note that we restrict our discussion to words with $k+1$ segments of $a$'s.

Let $1 \leq j \leq k$ and $1 \leq i \leq k+1$. We say that segment $i$ is \emph{bad} in $\cV_j$ if, intuitively, its $a$'s can be pumped together with both the $b$'s and $c$'s such that the words obtained are accepted by $\cV_j$. We denote $\alpha=|Q_{\text{max}}|!$, for $Q_{\text{max}}=\text{max}\{|\cV_l|\}_{l=1}^k$, and capture this idea as follows.
\shtodo{I usually don't like the ``Definition'' environment, but I think here it helps.}
\begin{definition}[Good and Bad Segments]
Segment $i$ is \emph{bad} in $\cV_j$ if there exist constants $\left\{m_i\right\}_{i=1}^{k+1},m_b,m_c \in \bbN$ such that:

\begin{itemize}
    \item All of the above constants are multiples of $\alpha$. 
    \item There is an accepting run $\rho$ of $\cV_j$ on $w=a^{m_1}\#a^{m_2}\#\cdots\#a^{m_{k+1}}\#b^{m_b}c^{m_c}$ that adheres to one of the following three forms:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\violet{a^{m_1}}\#\violet{a^{m_2}}\#\cdots \violet{a^{m_{i-1}}}\#\violet{a^{m_i}}\#\violet{a^{m_{i+1}}}\#\cdots\#\violet{a^{m_{k+1}}}\#\violet{b^{m_b}}\violet{c^{m_c}}$
        \item $\violet{a^{m_1}}\#\violet{a^{m_2}}\#\cdots \violet{a^{m_{i-1}}}\#\green{a^{m_i}}\#a^{m_{i+1}}\#\cdots\#a^{m_{k+1}}\#b^{m_b}c^{m_c}$
        \item $\violet{a^{m_1}}\#\violet{a^{m_2}}\#\cdots \violet{a^{m_{i-1}}}\#\violet{a^{m_i}}\#\violet{a^{m_{i+1}}}\#\cdots\#\violet{a^{m_{k+1}}}\#\green{b^{m_b}}c^{m_c}$.
    \end{enumerate}
    \shtodo{In a submitted paper, I don't think we can rely exclusively on the color scheme. So text must be added. Also, the colors don't mean exactly what was in the intro - they mean ``there exists an infix with'', right?}
    \aytodo{About the color scheme - fair enough, let's discuss how to do it cleanly. About the meaning here compared to the intro - I'm not sure I'm with you, what difference did you spot?}
    \shtodo{If I understand correctly, the existence of a run of forms 1 or 3 immediately means that all segments are bad, no? If that is the case, maybe we should separate this sort of general badness vs the ``real'' badness of def 2.}
    \aytodo{That's correct. I'm for it if it helps tidy up the arguments, but I'm not sure that it does}
    
\end{itemize}

If segment $i$ is not bad in $\cV_j$ - we say that it is \emph{good} in $\cV_j$.
\end{definition}

We now prove the following:

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:twosegmentsonebad}
    Let $1 \leq j \leq k$ and $1 \leq i_1\neq i_2 \leq k+1$. Then either $i_1$ or $i_2$ is bad in $\cV_j$.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    We first denote $\cV_j=\tup{Q,\Sigma,q_0,R,F}$. We inductively construct  preliminary constants $\left\{n_i\right\}_{i=1}^{k+1},n_b,n_c \in \bbN$. We define $n_1$ to be a multiple of $\alpha$ large enough so that \cref{lem:largeenoughwordnonnegativecycle} guarantees a non-negative cycle reading $n_1$ $a$'s from $(q_0,0)$. Assume we have constructed $n_1,\ldots n_{l-1}$. Let $n=(l-1+\sum_{z=1}^{l-1}n_z)W$. Since the word $u=a^{n_1}\#a^{n_2}\#\cdots\#a^{n_{l-1}}\#$ consists of $\frac{n}{W}$ letters, $n+1$ is greater than any counter value that can be reached in $\cV_j$ by reading $u$. We define $n_l$ to be a multiple of $\alpha$ large enough so that \cref{lem:largeenoughwordnonnegativecycle} guarantees a non-negative cycle reading $n_l$ $a$'s from any configuration of the form $\{(q,n+1) | q\in Q\}$. Finally, we set $n_b=n_c=\alpha$. Note that the choice of $n_b,n_c$ is not tight.

    Now, for every $x\in \bbN$, we obtain from $w$ a word $w_x$ by adding $x\alpha$ $a$'s to segments $i_1,i_2$ and to the segments of $b$'s and $c$'s. That is, $w_x=a^{n_1}\#\cdots\#a^{n_{i_1}+x\alpha}\#\cdots\#a^{n_{i_2}+x\alpha}\#\cdots\#a^{n_{k+1}}\#b^{n_b+x\alpha}c^{n_c+x\alpha}$.
    
    Observe that $w_x\in L(A)$. Indeed, since $n_{i_1} \geq n_b$, and $n_{i_2} \geq n_c$, we have that $n_{i_1}+x\alpha \geq n_b+x\alpha$, and $n_{i_2}+x\alpha \geq n_c+x\alpha$, and any run of $\cA$ that accumulates on a different counter for segments $i_1,i_2$ is guaranteed to be accepting. Therefore, $w_x$ is accepted by $\cV_j$ through a run $\rho_x$. Note that if, for some $x$, $\rho_x$ does not traverse a $\positive$ cycle neither in segment $i_1$ nor in $i_2$ - the maximal possible counter value of $\rho_x$ after reading \[a^{n_1}\#\cdots\#a^{n_{i_1}+x\alpha}\#\cdots\#a^{n_{i_2}+x\alpha}\#\cdots\#a^{n_{k+1}}\#\] according to \cref{lem:maxcounternopositivecycles} is $M_b=(k+1+\sum_{1 \leq z \leq k+1, z\neq i_1,i_2}n_z)W+2|Q|W$, a value not dependent on $x$. If there is no $\positive$ cycle in the segment of $b$'s as well - again the maximal counter value of $\rho$ right before reading the segment of  $c$'s is bounded by some constant $M_c=(k+2+\sum_{1 \leq z \leq k+1, z\neq i_1,i_2}n_z)W+3|Q|W$, dependent neither on $x$ nor on $M_b$. We choose $x$ large enough to satisfy:
    \shtodo{It needs to be made clearer that this is not a cyclic argument. Because it reads like you're first saying something about $\rho_x$, and then you're choosing $x$.}
    \aytodo{I see what you're saying, let's discuss it}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If $\rho_x$ does not traverse any $\positive$ cycle in segments $i_1,i_2$, then \cref{lem:largeenoughwordnonnegativecycle} guarantees a $\nonnegative$ cycle reading $(n_b+x\alpha)$ $b$'s from any configuration of the form $\{(q,M_b) | q\in Q\}$.
        \item If $\rho_x$ does not traverse any positive cycle neither in segments $i_1,i_2$ nor in the segment of $b$'s, then \cref{lem:largeenoughwordnonnegativecycle} guarantees a $\nonnegative$ cycle reading $(n_c+x\alpha)$ $c$'s from any configuration of the form $\{(q,M_c) | q\in Q\}$.
    \end{enumerate}

    We now claim that one of $i_1,i_2$ is bad for constants $n_1,\ldots n_{i_1}+x\alpha,\ldots n_{i_2}+x\alpha,\ldots n_{k+1}, n_b+x\alpha, n_c+x\alpha$.
    
    We prove correctness by analyzing $\rho_x$. By the method of construction - \cref{lem:largeenoughwordnonnegativecycle} guarantees that $\rho_x$ has a $\nonnegative$ cycles in segments $1,\ldots i_1-1$. If $\rho_x$ traverses a positive cycle in segment $i_1$, then $\rho_x$ is of the form $\violet{a^{n_1}}\#\violet{a^{n_2}}\#\cdots\violet{a^{n_{i-1}}}\#\green{a^{n_{i_1}+x\alpha}}\#\cdots \#a^{n_{i_2}+x\alpha}\#\cdots\#a^{n_{k+1}}\#b^{n_b+x\alpha}c^{n_c+x\alpha}$, and $i_1$ is bad in $\cV_j$.
  
    If $\rho_x$ does not traverse $\positive$ cycles in segment $i_1$ - again \cref{lem:largeenoughwordnonnegativecycle} guarantees $\nonnegative$ cycles in segments $i_1,i_1+1,\ldots, i_2-1$ (as for $i_1$ - we are guaranteed a $\nonnegative$ cycle reading $n_{i_1}$ $a$'s, all the more so for $n_{i_1}+x\alpha$ $s$'a. As for $i_1+1,\ldots i_2-1$ - if $\rho_x$ does not traverse $\positive$ cycles in segment $i_1$, then the maximal cumulative effect of segment $i_1$ is $W|Q|$. $n_{i_1+1}$ was constructed to guarantee a $\nonnegative$ cycle even in case the effect of segment $i_1$ was $Wn_{i_1} \geq W\alpha \geq W|Q|$). If there is a $\positive$ cycle in segment $i_2$ - then $\rho_x$ is of the form $\violet{a^{n_1}}\#\violet{a^{n_2}}\#\cdots \violet{a^{n_{i_2-1}}}\#\green{a^{n_{i_2}+x\alpha}}\#a^{n_{i_2+1}}\#\cdots\#a^{n_{k+1}}\#b^{n_b+x\alpha}c^{m_c+x\alpha}$,and $i_2$ is bad in $\cV_j$. Otherwise, using the same arguments as for segment $i_1$ - we know that segments $i_2+1,\ldots,i_{k+1}$ contain $\nonnegative$ cycles. We are left with dealing, in this case, with the segments of $b$'s and $c$'s. The choice of $x$ guarantees a $\nonnegative$ cycle in the segment of $b$'s. If $\rho_x$ traverses a $\positive$ cycle in the segment of $b$'s - then $w_x$ is of the form $\violet{a^{n_1}}\#\violet{a^{n_2}}\#\cdots \violet{a^{n_{k+1}}}\#\green{b^{m_b+x\alpha}}c^{n_c+x\alpha}$. Lastly, if there are no $\positive$ cycles in the segment of $b$'s - again the choice of $x$ guarantees a $\nonnegative$ cycle in the segment of $c$'s, and $w_x$ is of the form $\violet{a^{n_1}}\#\violet{a^{n_2}}\#\cdots\violet{a^{n_{k+1}}}\#\violet{b^{n_b+x\alpha}}\violet{c^{n_c+x\alpha}}$. In the two latter cases both $i_1$ and $i_2$ are bad in $\cV_j$.
\end{proof}

From \cref{lem:twosegmentsonebad} we deduce that each $\cV_j$ has at most one good segment (if $\cV_j$ had two good segments - $i_1$ and $i_2$ - this would contradict \cref{lem:twosegmentsonebad}). Therefore - all 1-VASSes together have at most $k$ good segments combined, which leaves at least one segment $l$ that is bad in every $\cV_j$. Therefore there exists constants $\{m_i^j\}_{i=1,j=1}^{i=k+1,j=k},\{m_b^j\}_{j=1}^k,\{m_c^j\}_{j=1}^k$ such that for all $1 \leq j \leq k$ it is the case that $a^{m^j_1}\#a^{m^j_2}\#\cdots\#a^{m^j_{k+1}}\#b^{m^j_b}c^{m^j_c} \in \lang(\cV_j)$ through a run $\rho_j$. Due to the conditions on the constants above, we are guaranteed that $\rho_j$ is in one of the following three forms:

\begin{itemize} 
    \item $\violet{a^{m^j_1}}\#\violet{a^{m^j_2}}\#\cdots\#\violet{a^{m^j_l}}\#\violet{a^{m^j_{l+1}}}\#\cdots\#\violet{a^{m^j_{k+1}}}\#\green{b^{m^j_b}}c^{m^j_c}$. We denote all 1-VASSes in this category as $\mathsf{GreenB}$.
    \item $\violet{a^{m^j_1}}\#\violet{a^{m^j_2}}\#\cdots\#\green{a^{m^j_l}}\#a^{m^j_{l+1}}\#\cdots\#a^{m^j_{k+1}}\#b^{m^j_b}c^{m^j_c}$. We denote all 1-VASSes in this category as $\mathsf{GreenL}$. 
    \item $\violet{a^{m^j_1}}\#\violet{a^{m^j_2}}\#\cdots\#\violet{a^{m^j_l}}\#\violet{a^{m^j_{l+1}}}\#\cdots\#\violet{a^{m^j_{k+1}}}\#\violet{b^{m^j_b}}\violet{c^{m^j_c}}$. We denote all 1-VASSes in this category as $\mathsf{Violet}$.
\end{itemize}

We will now prove that each $\{\cV_j\}_{1\leq j\leq k}$ accepts the following word (for constants that will be explained shortly): \hfill 
\[
w=a^{m^\text{max}_1}\#a^{m^\text{max}_2}\#\cdots\#a^{m^\text{spl}}\#a^{m^\text{max}_{l+1}}\#\cdots\#a^{m^\text{max}_{k+1}}\#b^{m^\text{spb}}c^{m^\text{max}_c}
\]
We first define $m^\text{max}_i=\mathsf{max}\{m^j_i\}_{1\leq j \leq k}$ for all $1\leq i \leq k+1$. Almost every transition in the flow of this analysis is based on \cref{lem:cyclethensimplecycle} and its following observations. The process of constructing accepting runs on $w$ for all 1-VASSes is as follows:

We first handle 1-VASSes in $\mathsf{GreenB}$. For each such $\cV_j$, there is an accepting run $\rho_j$ on \[\violet{a^{m^j_1}}\#\violet{a^{m^j_2}}\#\cdots\#\violet{a^{m^j_l}}\#\violet{a^{m^j_{l+1}}}\#\cdots\#\violet{a^{m^j_{k+1}}}\#\green{b^{m^j_b}}c^{m^j_c}\] 
We use it to construct a run $\rho'_j$ on \[\violet{a^{m^\text{max}_1}}\#\violet{a^{m^\text{max}_2}}\#\cdots\#\violet{a^{m^j_l}}\#\violet{a^{m^\text{max}_{l+1}}}\#\cdots\#\violet{a^{m^{\text{max}}_{k+1}}}\#\green{b^{m^j_b}}c^{m^j_c}\]
We use $\rho'_j$ to construct a \emph{semi-run} $\rho''_j$ on: \[\violet{a^{m^\text{max}_1}}\#\violet{a^{m^\text{max}_2}}\#\cdots\#\violet{a^{m^j_l}}\#\violet{a^{m^\text{max}_{l+1}}}\#\cdots\#\violet{a^{m^{\text{max}}_{k+1}}}\#\green{b^{m^j_b}}c^{m^\text{max}_c}\] Lastly, we construct a run $\rho'''_j$ on \[\violet{a^{m^\text{max}_1}}\#\violet{a^{m^\text{max}_2}}\#\cdots\#\violet{a^{m^j_l}}\#\violet{a^{m^\text{max}_{l+1}}}\#\cdots\#\violet{a^{m^{\text{max}}_{k+1}}}\#\green{b^{m^\text{spb}}}c^{m^\text{max}_c}\] such that $m^\text{spb}$ is chosen to be large enough such that $\rho'''_j$ is accepting (i.e., a run, rather than a semi-run) for all $1\leq j \leq k$.
\shtodo{are the transitions above all by pumping 0-cycles?}
\aytodo{Not necessarily, the first transition is by pumping 0-cycles, the second is by pumping a cycle of an unknown effect (maybe negative), and the third by pumping a positive cycle}
Note that the resulting word is the word we want - except for the $l$'th segment, which will be fixed shortly.

We now handle 1-VASSes in $\mathsf{GreenL}$. We perform a similar process. We start with an accepting run $\rho_j$ on $\violet{a^{m^j_1}}\#\violet{a^{m^j_2}}\#\cdots\#\green{a^{m^j_l}}\#a^{m^j_{l+1}}\#\cdots\#a^{m^j_{k+1}}\#b^{m^j_b}c^{m^j_c}$.  We continue with a run $\rho'_j$ on $\violet{a^{m^\text{max}_1}}\#\violet{a^{m^\text{max}_2}}\#\cdots\#\green{a^{m^j_l}}\#a^{m^j_{l+1}}\#\cdots\#a^{m^j_{k+1}}\#b^{m^j_b}c^{m^j_c}$. We continue with a semi-run $\rho''_j$ on $\violet{a^{m^\text{max}_1}}\#\violet{a^{m^\text{max}_2}}\#\cdots\#\green{a^{m^j_l}}\#a^{m^\text{max}_{l+1}}\#\cdots\#a^{m^\text{max}_{k+1}}\#b^{m^\text{spb}}c^{m^\text{max}_c}$, and finish with a run $\rho'''_j$ on $\violet{a^{m^\text{max}_1}}\#\violet{a^{m^\text{max}_2}}\#\cdots\#\green{a^{m^\text{spl}}}\#a^{m^\text{max}_{l+1}}\#\cdots\#a^{m^\text{max}_{k+1}}\#b^{m^\text{spb}}c^{m^\text{max}_c}$, when $m^\text{spl}$ is chosen to be large enough such that every $\rho'''_j$ is indeed a legal run.

We now go back to 1-VASSes in $\mathsf{GreenB}$ and fix the $l$-th segment by constructing an accepting run on $\violet{a^{m^\text{max}_1}}\#\violet{a^{m^\text{max}_2}}\#\cdots\#\violet{a^{m^\text{spl}}}\#\violet{a^{m^\text{max}_{l+1}}}\#\cdots\#\violet{a^{m^{\text{max}}_{k+1}}}\#\green{b^{m^\text{spb}}}c^{m^\text{max}_c}$.

We are left with 1-VASSes in $\mathsf{Violet}$, which are the easiest to handle. We simply construct an accepting run $\rho'_j$ on \hfill $\violet{a^{m^\text{max}_1}}\#\violet{a^{m^\text{max}_2}}\#\cdots\#\violet{a^{m^\text{spl}}}\#\violet{a^{m^\text{max}_{l+1}}}\#\cdots\#\violet{a^{m^\text{max}_{k+1}}}\#\violet{b^{m^\text{spb}}}\violet{c^{m^\text{max}_c}}$ directly from $\rho_j$ on $\violet{a^{m^j_1}}\#\violet{a^{m^j_2}}\#\cdots\#\violet{a^{m^j_l}}\#\violet{a^{m^j_{l+1}}}\#\cdots\#\violet{a^{m^j_{k+1}}}\#\violet{b^{m^j_b}}\violet{c^{m^j_c}}$.

We have proved that $w=a^{m^\text{max}_1}\#a^{m^\text{max}_2}\#\cdots\#a^{m^\text{spl}}\#a^{m^\text{max}_{l+1}}\#\cdots\#a^{m^\text{max}_{k+1}}\#b^{m^\text{spb}}c^{m^\text{max}_c}$ is accepted by every $\cV_j$, $1 \leq j \leq k$. We change the terminology to avoid clutter and refer to $w$ as  $w=a^{m_1}\#a^{m_2}\#\cdots\#a^{m_l}\#a^{m_{l+1}}\#\cdots\#a^{m_{k+1}}\#b^{m_b}c^{m_c}$. Not only does every $\cV_j$ accept $w$ - it does so through a run that either of the form $a^{m_1}\#a^{m_2}\#\cdots\#\green{a^{m_l}}\#a^{m_{l+1}}\#\cdots\#a^{m_{k+1}}\#b^{m_b}c^{m_c}$, or \hfill $w=a^{m_1}\#a^{m_2}\#\cdots\#\violet{a^{m_l}}\#a^{m_{l+1}}\#\cdots\#a^{m_{k+1}}\#\green{b^{m_b}}c^{m_c}$ or \hfill $w=a^{m_1}\#a^{m_2}\#\cdots\#\violet{a^{m_l}}\#a^{m_{l+1}}\#\cdots\#a^{m_{k+1}}\#\violet{b^{m_b}}\violet{c^{m_c}}$. Either way there are constants $x,y,z >0$ such that $x,y,z$ are all multiples of $\alpha$, and the word $a^{m_1}\#a^{m_2}\#\cdots\#a^{m_l+xn}\#a^{m_{l+1}}\#\cdots\#a^{m_{k+1}}\#b^{m_b+yn}c^{m_c+zn}$ is accepted by every $\cV_j$ for all $n\in \bbN$. We then choose $n$ large enough to satisfy $\sum_{1\leq i \leq k+1, i \neq l} m_i < \text{min}\{m_b+yn,m_c+zn\}$, and the resulting word is accepted by every 1-VASS although not accepted by $\cA$.  
\shtodo{The last paragraph can be slightly more detailed. But we can leave this for the paper. All in all - Very Nice!}
