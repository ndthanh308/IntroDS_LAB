  "abstract": "In today's world, where societal challenges in the areas of digitalization, demographic change and sustainability are becoming increasingly complex, new innovation structures are needed to meet these challenges. Living Labs or also Real World Laboratories prove to be such. Through their applied methods such as co-creation, they integrate users into research, making it more user-centric. Which other research infrastructures exist and how they can be differentiated is presented in this paper on the basis of a systematic literature research. Furthermore, methods for user integration are examined and provided in the form of an overview.",
