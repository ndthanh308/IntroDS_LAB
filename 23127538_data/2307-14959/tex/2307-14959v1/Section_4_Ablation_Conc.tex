\section{Conclusion}
Highly Imbalanced datasets are present in most medical image classifications. This work presents Fed-MAS to deal with this problem. We show that publicly available self-supervised models benefit the FL training procedure more than restricting the optimization direction by incorporating the global attribute imbalance. Future work can explore delayed re-weighting to unleash non-vanishing terms and explore MAS with different local learning strategies in FL settings.
