\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we introduced \system{}, an augmented reality sketching tool to bring life to AR sketches based on real-world interactions. 
The design of our system is informed by the taxonomy and design space exploration of existing scribble animations. 
To support these animation techniques, this paper contributes a set of interaction techniques that enable real-time sketched animation without preparation or pre-defined configurations. 
Our user study confirms that our tool is easy to use yet enables expressive sketched animation.
We discussed limitations and future work to highlight broader challenges to enable more expressive AR sketched animation.
