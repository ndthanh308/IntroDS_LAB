  "abstract": "The method of moving frames (repère mobile) was used by Elie Cartan as a way of organizing the identification of differential invariants and solving equivalence problems. In this expository paper, we discuss how moving frames are used to determine differential invariants of curves and surfaces under the action of Euclidean, affine and conformal transformation groups.",
