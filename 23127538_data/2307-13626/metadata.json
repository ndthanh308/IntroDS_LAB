  "abstract": "We show that the locations where finite- and infinite-time clustering occurs for the 1D Euler-alignment system can be determined using only the initial data. Our present work provides the first results on the structure of the finite-time singularity set and asymptotic clusters associated to a weak solution. In many cases, the eventual size of the cluster can be read off directly from the flux associated to a scalar balance law formulation of the system.",
