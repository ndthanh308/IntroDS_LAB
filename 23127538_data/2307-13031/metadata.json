  "abstract": "We study a model of spinless fermions on the honeycomb lattice with nearest-neighbor exclusion and extended repulsive interactions that exhibits `lattice supersymmetry' [P. Fendley, K. Schoutens, and J. de Boer, Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 120402 (2003)]. Using a combination of exact diagonalization of large ($N\\leq56$ site) systems, mean-field numerics, and symmetry analysis, we establish a rich phase structure as a function of fermion density, that includes non-Fermi liquid behavior, resonating charge stripes, domain-wall and bubble physics, and identify a finite range of fillings with extensive ground state degeneracy and both gapped and gapless spectra. We comment on the stability of our results to relaxing the stringent requirements for supersymmetry, and on their possible broader relevance to systems of strongly-correlated electrons with extended repulsive interactions.",
