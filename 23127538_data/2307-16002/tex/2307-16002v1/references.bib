abstract = {Objectives:
The main objective of this article is to provide a critical review of up-to-date contributions to simultaneous lightwave information and power transfer (SLIPT) in optical wireless communication (OWC) networks.
Methods:
The first section of this article emphasizes the need for the exploitation of optical signals for energy harvesting purposes in order to develop a sustainable OWC system. In the second section, we provide basic guidelines to be considered for designing an efficient SLIPT system. In the third section, SLIPT structure from the viewpoint of transceiver architecture is analyzed with respect to achievable rate and harvested energy. The fourth section provides a critical review of various articles on SLIPT in OWC networks.
Results:
Our main findings from the analysis in section three show that receiver diversity can be achieved using multiple photodetectors. Consequently, this leads to an improved achievable rate and harvested energy of the SLIPT receivers. Also, based on the limitations of papers presented in section four, we are able to unlock several open issues and potential solutions that can be explored as future research areas.
Conclusions:
SLIPT is considered to be a key promising technique that can be used in developing green OWC networks. In this article, the performance of SLIPT receivers and various articles on SLIPT-related designs have are presented. Based on the transceiver analysis, limitations and design challenges of the articles presented, several areas that can be explored for future research work are identified. Thus, more contributions are still needed toward developing efficient SLIPT-based systems.}

abstract  ="Lightweight and flexible solar cells are highly interesting materials for use in new applications{,} such as spacecraft{,} aircraft and personal pack load. PbS colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) exhibit a broad and strong light absorption spectrum covering the ultraviolet-visible-near infrared region{,} allowing for incorporation of very thin CQD films into solar cells with high power conversion efficiency (PCE) from solar light to electricity. Herein{,} we report an extremely lightweight and ultra-flexible CQD solar cell constructed on a polyethylene naphthalate substrate with a thickness of 1.3 μm. A solution-processed Ag nanowire network with excellent mechanical{,} optical and electrical properties was prepared as the front-electrode in the solar cell. The thickness of the complete CQD solar cell is less than 2 μm{,} and ∼10\% PCE with a weight of 6.5 g m−2 is achieved{,} resulting in a power-per-weight output of 15.2 W g−1. The flexible solar cell possesses durable mechanical properties and maintains high-level photovoltaic performance under extreme deformation and after repeated compression–stretching deformation. Moreover{,} the flexible CQD solar cell shows impressive stability both under continuous illumination and after storage under ambient conditions. These results reveal that solution-processed CQDs are compatible with an ultra-flexible substrate for the construction of ultra-lightweight infrared light-converting CQD solar cells with possibilities for new exciting solar energy applications."}

abstract = {Solar-powered unmanned aerial vehicles (SUAVs) are a promising solution to increase the flight time of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in the sky, reducing human interventions for battery charging. Exploiting networked SUAVs for providing long-duration wireless communication cannot only improve the signal transmission reliability but realize energy autonomy. To reap these benefits, in this article, we propose an efficient energy and radio resource management framework based on intelligent power cognition at the SUAVs. Thereby, power-cognitive SUAVs can learn the environment including the spatial distributions of solar energy density, the channel state evolution, and the traffic patterns of wireless communication applications in adaption to the environment changes. These SUAVs intelligently adjust the energy harvesting, information transmission, and flight trajectory to improve the utilization of solar energy for two primary goals: staying aloft over a long time period and achieving high communication performance. We adopt reinforcement learning to compute the optimal decisions for maximization of the total system throughput within the lifetime of the SUAV. Simulation results show that the proposed power cognition scheme can simultaneously improve the communication throughput and the harvested energy for SUAVs.}

For this purpose, we provide closed-form expressions about the link availability and optimum beam divergence angle under the effect of generalized two-dimensional Gaussian distribution of the alignment error between the transmitter and receiver. These simple and closed-form expressions reduce the computational complexity for performance optimization. Thus, they can be used to (i)\&\#x00A0;reduce the power consumption required for adaptive beam control and (ii)\&\#x00A0;facilitate the fast operation of the control techniques. The results show that the adaptive beam control techniques can improve system performance under various scenarios.},

abstract = {In this work we present a unified performance analysis of bistatic modulating retro-reflector (MRR) communication systems for all turbulence regimes where the free space optical (FSO) link is modeled by the generalized Málaga distribution. In particular, we obtain closed-form expressions for probability density function (PDF) of the system fading channel as well as PDF, cumulative distribution function (CDF), moment generating function (MGF), and moments of the system received signal to noise ratio (SNR) using Meijer’s G function. Based on the conducted analysis, we derive exact closed form expressions for the system average bit error rate (BER), outage probability, ergodic capacity, and amount of fading (AF). The closed form expressions are obtained in terms of Meijer’s G function. Furthermore, asymptotic expressions of the system average BER and outage probability at high SNR values are presented in terms of simple elementary functions.}

    abstract = "{Free-space optical communications (FSOCs) have recently emerged as a promising solution for various communication scenarios. However, the pointing, acquisition, and tracking (PAT) is a technically challenging issue, especially in airborne FSOC systems. In this paper, we present an adaptive beam control technique combined with beaconless PAT using a variable focus lens. By using the lens whose focal length can be tuned electrically, we facilitate the coarse PAT by enlarging the beam size and also mitigate the adverse effects of pointing errors by adjusting the beam divergence angle adaptively to the link conditions. The major benefit of the proposed scheme is that the beam control can be implemented in a simple and compact manner, without relying on mechanical movements. We carry out a proof-of-concept experimental demonstration of the proposed scheme for a 10-Gb/s free-space optical link over 104 m. The demonstration shows that the probability of PAT success can be improved considerably by using the proposed scheme. It also shows that the proposed scheme could result in a system loss reduction of 6.4 dB and improve the tolerance to pointing errors up to 500 μrad for a target bit-error ratio of 10−3. The response time of the lens is measured to be \\&lt;211 ms. We confirm experimentally that the receiver size and the amount of pointing error determine the optimum beam size at the receiver.}",

Terrestrially, the need for line-of-sight propagation paths represents a constraint unless very large numbers of base-station masts are deployed, while satellite systems have capacity limitations. An emerging solution is offered by high-altitude platforms (HAPs) operating in the stratosphere at altitudes of up to 22 km to provide communication facilities that can exploit the best features of both terrestrial and satellite schemes. This paper outlines the application and features of HAPs, and some specific development programmes. Particular consideration is given to the use of HAPs for delivery of future broadband wireless communications.},

ABSTRACT={Augmenting ground-level communications with flying networks, such as the high-altitude platform system (HAPS), is among the major innovative initiatives of the next generation of wireless systems (6G). Given HAPS quasi-static positioning at the stratosphere, HAPS-to-ground and HAPS-to-air connectivity frameworks are expected to be prolific in terms of data acquisition and computing, especially given the mild weather and quasi-constant wind speed characteristics of the stratospheric layer. This paper explores the opportunities stemming from the realization of cloud-enabled HAPS in the context of telecommunications applications and services. The paper first advocates for the potential physical advantages of deploying HAPS as flying data-centers, also known as super-macro base stations. The paper then describes various cloud services that can be offered from the HAPS and the merits that can be achieved by this integration, such as enhancing the quality, speed, and range of the offered services. The proposed services span a wide range of fields, including satellites, Internet of Things (IoT), ad hoc networks (such as sensor; vehicular; and aerial networks), gaming, and social networks. For each service, the paper illustrates the methods that would be used by cloud providers to offload the service data to the HAPS and enable the cloud customers to consume the service. The paper further sheds light on the challenges that need to be addressed for realizing practical cloud-enabled HAPS, mainly, those related to high energy, processing power, quality of service (QoS), and security considerations. Finally, the paper discusses some open issues on the topic, namely, HAPS mobility and message routing, HAPS security via blockchain and machine learning, artificial intelligence-based resource allocation in cloud-enabled HAPS, and integration with vertical heterogeneous networks.}

abstract="One motivation for the model we develop in this chapter is provided by the atmospheric-noise data shown in Fig. 1.3. It is evident that a point process model can account for the occurrence times of the pulses. However, these times alone do not reflect all of the significant features. The amplitudes of the pulses exhibit wide variation and have a strong influence on a radio receiver operating at low frequencies. Even a first-approximation model for low-frequency atmospheric noise should, therefore, include the amplitude as well as occurrence time of each pulse. It is this procedure of endowing each temporal point with an ancillary variable, an amplitude in this instance, which characterizes the models of this chapter.",

As systems continue to increase in transmission rate, security concerns associated with detector dead times can limit the production rate of sifted bits. We present a model of high-speed QKD in this limit that identifies an optimum transmission rate for a system with given link loss and detector response characteristics.}

abstract = {When the beam waist at the receiver is significantly larger than the receiver size, free-space optical (FSO) links may be vulnerable to some optical tapping risks at the physical layer. In this paper, we conduct a new framework for the analysis of the secrecy performance in terms of the secrecy outage probability (SOP) of FSO systems affected by gamma-gamma (GG) turbulence-induced fading channels with pointing errors. As a key feature, we evaluate the SOP in the presence of an external eavesdropper with generic location and orientation. For that reason, a new misalignment error model is proposed to consider a non-orthogonal optical beam with respect to the photodetector plane at the eavesdropper\&\#x2019;s receiver, where the effective area is determined by a rotated ellipse. New approximate and asymptotic solutions at high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) for the secrecy performance are obtained in closed-form, which are verified by exact Monte Carlo simulations. By using the developed expressions, we analyze in greater detail some effects such as the SNR of the eavesdropper\&\#x2019;s channel, the normalized beamwidth at the receiver-side, and the location and orientation of the eavesdropper on the secrecy performance for different turbulence conditions.},

This chapter presents material that provides a basic background of the probability theory. Depending on the nature of equations involved (in terms of random variables) in the problem, a stochastic optimization problem is called a stochastic linear, geometric, dynamic, or nonlinear programming problem. When two or more random variables are being considered simultaneously, their joint behavior is determined by a joint probability distribution function. The chapter also discusses the stochastic linear, nonlinear, and geometric programming techniques.}

abstract = {In this paper, we study two adaptive beam control techniques, where the beam divergence angle is adjusted at the transmitter to (i)\&\#x00A0;maximize link availability or (ii)\&\#x00A0;minimize transmitter power while maintaining target link availability. For this purpose, we provide closed-form expressions about the link availability and optimum beam divergence angle under the effect of generalized two-dimensional Gaussian distribution of the alignment error between the transmitter and receiver. These simple and closed-form expressions reduce the computational complexity for performance optimization. Thus, they can be used to (i)\&\#x00A0;reduce the power consumption required for adaptive beam control and (ii)\&\#x00A0;facilitate the fast operation of the control techniques. The results show that the adaptive beam control techniques can improve system performance under various scenarios.},
