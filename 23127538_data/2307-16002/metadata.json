  "abstract": "Due to the narrow beamwidths of laser Gaussian beams, accurate tracking of laser beam's angle-of-arrival is an important problem in mobile free-space optical communications. In most optical receivers today, fine tracking of angle-of-arrival involves estimating the location of the focused beam spot projected onto a focal plane array. However, for very thin Gaussian beams, both the location as well as the energy of the spot varies considerably with the variation of angle-of-arrival. In this study, we have analyzed the relationship between the angle-of-arrival and the energy of laser spot on the focal plane. We then exploited this relationship to enhance the angle-of-arrival estimation performance of our proposed receiver that takes into account both the location as well as the energy of the laser spot while estimating the angle-of-arrival. The derived Cramer-Rao bounds indicate that the system performance can be enhanced significantly for narrow Gaussian beams when both the spot location and energy are exploited for angle-of-arrival estimation.",
