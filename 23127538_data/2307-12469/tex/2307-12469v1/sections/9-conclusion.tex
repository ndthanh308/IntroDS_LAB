\section{Conclusion}
Our study has explored the use of LLMs to generate effective fuzz drivers, revealing their potential for facilitating fuzzing of API targets.
However, practical application of LLM-generated drivers requires careful filtering to ensure effectiveness and avoid false alarms.
We have also analyzed the effects, advantages, and disadvantages of five different types of strategies.
Comparing the generated drivers with manually written ones, we found that LLM-generated drivers can produce competent fuzzing outcomes, but there is still room for further improvement.
