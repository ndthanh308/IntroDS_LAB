  "abstract": "Spin network systems can be used to achieve quantum state transfer with high fidelity and to generate entanglement. A new approach to design spin-chain-based spin network systems, for shortrange quantum information processing and phase-sensing, has been proposed recently in [1]. In this paper, we investigate the scalability of such systems, by designing larger spin network systems that can be used for longer-range quantum information tasks, such as connecting together quantum processors. Furthermore, we present more complex spin network designs, which can produce different types of entangled states. Simulations of disorder effects show that even such larger spin network systems are robust against realistic levels of disorder.",
