\section{Introduction}
Graphical User Interfaces (GUI) are ubiquitous in almost all modern desktop software, mobile applications (apps), and online websites.
They provide a visual bridge between a software application and end-users through which they can interact with each other.
A good visual design makes an application attractive and easy to use, which significantly affects the success of the application and the loyalty of its users~\cite{goldschmidt1994visual}.
With the pervasiveness and diversity of devices, especially mobile ones, users tend to use the same app across different platforms in different scenarios (e.g., watching YouTube on a phone on the bus while using it on a tablet or TV at home)~\cite{joorabchi2013real}.
When utilizing apps on TV and tablets, especially those within the media, education, and tools categories, the adaptation to a large-screen TV/tablet display substantially elevates the user experience.
Therefore, to ensure usability,  software GUIs need to be adaptive to various screen sizes and densities, ranging from small 4.7-inch smartwatches to 75-inch smart TVs.


%Problem
Although one app may run well on different platforms with the same operating system (e.g., Android), the content may not display well without customization for different devices or screens.
For example, one app designed for the Android phone will only be displayed in the middle of the TV screen with a large dark space on the two sides due to the different aspect ratios as seen in Figure~\ref{fig:currentExamples} (\emph{Direct Mirroring}). 
Additionally, smart TVs and mobile phones interact differently. 
Mobile phones employ fingers to touch and swipe, while smart TVs require remote controls.
TVs need to be redesigned GUIs to accommodate different interactions as well as differences in size and layout.

Currently, there are three ways commonly used to deal with this issue.
First, some GUI development frameworks provide support of responsive and adaptive design~\cite{adaptiveUI} for developers to adapt the GUI to any possible screen size, such as Android's Material Design~\cite{laine2021responsive} and iOS Auto Layout~\cite{iosAdaptive}.
The \emph{Adaptive Layout} in Figure~\ref{fig:currentExamples} shows an example of the adaptive layout.
While these techniques adjust the GUI according to device screen size, they can inadvertently magnify or misalign UI components, diminishing the user experience. Moreover, as TVs employ interaction modalities distinct from mobile devices, like remote controls or voice commands, such designs may lack requisite support. 
This solution, primarily tailored for devices with minor screen size variations, such as mobile phones and tablets, may not be ideal for TVs, thereby presenting challenges in mobile-to-TV app adaptation.

% To some extent, the adaptive responsive design may work well on different screens (e.g., phone to tablet) but cannot adapt to a large difference with different interactions (e.g., phone to TV).

%Limitation of existing approaches
Second, certain developers choose to devise platform-distinct GUIs or craft unique apps tailored to the TV interface. 
The task of originating a dedicated TV app and the associated upkeep is resource-intensive and time-consuming.
Considering the commonalities in functionalities between mobile and TV apps and the potential to leverage extant designs and resources, there exists a strong rationale for repurposing assets, potentially yielding significant developmental cost savings.

% Furthermore, a consistent interface, echoing user predilections for uniformity across devices, streamlines their adaptation process~\cite{li2017droidbot, lowdermilk2013user}. 
% Prominent apps, such as YouTube and Spotify, exemplify this by retaining congruent designs across mobile and TV interfaces. 
% Such uniformity not only augments user experience but also facilitates developers by allowing the reuse of code and design components, culminating in decreased development durations and expenditures~\cite{mendoza2013mobile, lowdermilk2013user}.

Third, there are some screen mirroring apps (e.g., Chromecast~\cite{chromecast}), which are used to cast music, video, play games, and display photos on a big screen.
However, these are effective primarily for video projection rather than general app screens.
Phone manufacturers like Samsung, Apple, Huawei, and OnePlus have introduced the concept of Desktop Mode~\cite{huaweiDesk, Dex} for cross-screen GUI conversion via their phones.
Desktop Mode maps the current phone GUIs to larger external screens via an HDMI adaptor or WiFi by redesigning GUI layouts individually to improve the user experience with a larger screen.
The essence of these mirroring technologies revolves around either the pre-configuration of layouts for specific apps or the employment of adaptive layout techniques for projection.


%Our solution and Benefits
To overcome these limitations, we propose an approach for generating the appropriate GUI layout for Android TV based on the existing GUI design for phones.
Unlike responsive design, where a screen 'flows' from a phone design into a larger device, adaptive projection in our approach offers tailor-made solutions. 
Given the app GUI of a page on a mobile phone, our approach automatically generates the corresponding GUI code to make it adaptive to the TV screen.
The development team, including the visual designers and developers, will benefit from our approach.
Once they finish the phone app development, our approach can automatically generate the GUI design and TV implementation for any phone page.
Designers and developers can easily customize it to enhance their productivity without starting from scratch.

%empirical study
To build the tool, we first investigate how many apps currently support smart TV in 5,580 popular apps from Google Play\cite{googleplay}.
We find only 5.34\% of apps support running on smart TV.
Second, we perform a formative study on the characteristics of current TV-phone apps and GUIs.
We collect 1405 TV-phone app pairs from Google Play and Dangbei\cite{dangbei} but only collect 589 TV-phone GUI pairs with clear GUI correspondence in these app pairs.
We then summarize 12 and 9 categories of GUI components groups common on mobile and TV, respectively, and analyzed their corresponding conversion.
%summarisation of the approach 
Based on the empirical study results, we build our tool in the following steps: group isolated GUI components parsed from GUI metadata captured by UI Automator~\cite{uiautomator}, convert phone GUI groups into corresponding TV groups, optimize their layouts by OR constraints formulas~\cite{jiang2019orc}, and translate current TV GUI to our language - and platform free GUI domain-specific language (DSL) for further development. 

%evaluation summerization
We choose two of the best-known and most commonly used technologies: desktop mode and direct mapping as the baselines for the evaluation.
We select mIoU, overall satisfaction, and structure rationality as the metrics to evaluate the converted TV GUIs by our approach and baselines.
We also recruited 20 participants with extensive experience in Android GUI development, design, and use to evaluate the converted TV GUIs. 
The experimental results show that TV GUIs converted by our approach achieve 21.05\%, 10.42\%, and 21.31\% improvement in mIoU, overall satisfaction, and structure rationality than the best current conversion techniques.
Besides, a pilot user study also provides the initial evidence of the usefulness of our tool for bootstrapping adaptive GUI from phone to TV.

%contribution list
Our contributions to this work are summarized as follows:
\begin{itemize}    
    \item As far as we know, this is the first study on automated GUI conversion from smartphone to TV GUI; 
    
    \item We propose a new approach to generate TV-hosted GUIs from Android mobile phone GUIs;
    
    \item We carry out an empirical study to understand the current status of GUI support in the phone app to TV display and how the GUI mapping patterns between two platforms; and
    
    \item We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach with extensive automated evaluation and manual checking. We also provide initial evidence of our tool's usefulness via a pilot user study.
