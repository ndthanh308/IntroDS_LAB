  "abstract": "This work deals with a chemotaxis model where an external source involving a sub and superquadratic growth effect contrasted by nonlocal dampening reaction influences the motion of a cell density attracted by a chemical signal. We study the mechanism of the two densities once their initial configurations are fixed in bounded impenetrable regions; in the specific, we establish that no gathering effect for the cells can appear in time provided that the dampening effect is strong enough.",
