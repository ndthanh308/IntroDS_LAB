  "abstract": "This work examines some aspects related to the existence of negative mass. The requirement for the partition function to converge leads to two distinct approaches. Initially, convergence is achieved by assuming a negative absolute temperature, which results in an imaginary partition function and complex entropy. Subsequently, convergence is maintained by keeping the absolute temperature positive while introducing an imaginary velocity. This modification leads to a positive partition function and real entropy. It seems the utilization of imaginary velocity may yield more plausible physical results compared to the use of negative temperature, at least for the partition function and entropy.",
