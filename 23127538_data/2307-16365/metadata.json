  "abstract": "This paper considers consumption and portfolio optimization problems with recursive preferences in both infinite and finite time regions. Specially, the financial market consists of a risk-free asset and a risky asset that follows a general stochastic volatility process. By using Bellman's dynamic programming principle, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation is derived for characterizing the optimal consumption-investment strategy and the corresponding value function. Based on the conjecture of the exponential-polynomial form of the value function, we prove that, when the order of the polynomial $n\\leq2$, the HJB equation has an analytical solution if the investor with unit elasticity of intertemporal substitution (EIS) and an approximate solution otherwise.",
