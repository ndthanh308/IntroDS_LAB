  "abstract": "The electronic structure of short-chain thiophenes (thiophene, 2,2'-bithiophene and 2,2':5',2'-terthiophene) in the gas phase has been investigated by combining the outcomes of Near-Edge X-ray-Absorption Fine-Structure (NEXAFS) and X-ray Photoemission Spectroscopy (XPS) at the C K-edge with those of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The calculated NEXAFS spectra provide a comprehensive description of the main experimental features and allow their attribution. The evolution of the C1s NEXAFS spectral features is analyzed as a function of the number of thiophene rings; a tendency to a stabilization for increasing chain length is found. The computation of the binding energy allows to assign the experimental XPS peaks to the different carbon sites on the basis of both the inductive effects generated by the presence of the S atom as well as of the differential aromaticity effects.",
