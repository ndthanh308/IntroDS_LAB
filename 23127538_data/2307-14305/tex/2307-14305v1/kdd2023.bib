abstract = {Product and service reviews are abundantly available online, but selecting relevant information from them involves a significant amount of time. The authors address this problem with Starlet, a novel approach for extracting multidocument summarizations that considers aspect rating distributions and language modeling. These features encourage the inclusion of sentences in the summary that preserve the overall opinion distribution and reflect the reviews' original language.},
