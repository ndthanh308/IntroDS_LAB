  "abstract": "In the presented work we study, by means of numerical simulations, the behaviour of a suspension of active ring polymers in the bulk and under lateral confinement. When changing the separation between the confining planes and the polymers' density, we detect the emergence of a self-organised dynamical state, characterised by the coexistence of slowly diffusing clusters of rotating disks and faster rings moving in between them. This system represents a peculiar case at the crossing point between polymer, liquid crystals and active matter physics, where the interplay between activity, topology and confinement leads to a spontaneous segregation of a one component solution.",
