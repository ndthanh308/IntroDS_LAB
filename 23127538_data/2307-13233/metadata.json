  "abstract": "Topological phases have become an enabling role in exploiting new applications of nonlinear optics in recent years. Here we theoretically propose a valley photonic crystal resonator emulating topologically protected dissipative Kerr soliton combs. It is shown that topological resonator modes can be observed in the resonator. Moreover, we also simulate the dynamic evolution of the topological resonator with the injection of a continuous-wave pump laser. We find that the topological optical frequency combs evolve from Turing rolls to chaotic states, and eventually into single soliton states. More importantly, such dissipative Kerr soliton combs generated in the resonator are inborn topologically protected, showing robustness against sharp bends and structural disorders. Our design supporting topologically protected dissipative Kerr soliton combs could be implemented experimentally in on-chip nanofabricated photonic devices.",
