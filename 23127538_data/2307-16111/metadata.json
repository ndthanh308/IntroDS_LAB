  "abstract": "We investigate the prospects of probing the doubly-charged scalars of the minimal Left-Right Symmetric model (MLRSM) at a muon collider. We assess its capability by studying the production of doubly-charged scalars and their subsequent decay into four charged lepton final states containing the same-charge lepton pairs. We find that the channels with same-charge electron and muon pairs, i.e., ($e^{\\pm}e^{\\pm}μ^{\\mp}μ^{\\mp}$ and its charge conjugated pairs), have the largest sensitivity due to the lowest Standard Model background. Besides, we show that the possibility of using fully polarized initial muon beams in the muon collider can enhance the detection sensitivity of doubly-charged scalars of the MLRSM. Furthermore, we show that one can put exclusion limits on the magnitudes of triplet Yukawa couplings that are directly related to the neutrino sector of the MLRSM for the mass range $1.1-5$ TeV of the doubly-charged scalars.",
