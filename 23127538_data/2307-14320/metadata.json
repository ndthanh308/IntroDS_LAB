  "abstract": "This paper describes the new concept of the double-LGAD. The goal is to increase the charge at the input of the electronics, keeping a time resolution equal or better than a standard (single) LGAD; this has been realized by adding the charges of two coupled LGADs while still using a single front-end electronics. The study here reported has been done starting from single LGAD with a thickness of 25 \\textmu{m}, 35 \\textmu{m} and 50 \\textmu{m}.",
