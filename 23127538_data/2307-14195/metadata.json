  "abstract": "The (weak) chromatic number of a hypergraph $H$, denoted by $χ(H)$, is the smallest number of colors required to color the vertices of $H$ so that no hyperedge of $H$ is monochromatic. For every $2\\le k\\le d+1$, denote by $χ_L(k,d)$ (resp. $χ_{PL}(k,d)$) the supremum $\\sup_H χ(H)$ where $H$ runs over all finite $k$-uniform hypergraphs such that $H$ forms the collection of maximal faces of a simplicial complex that is linearly (resp. PL) embeddable in $\\mathbb{R}^d$.\n  Following the program by Heise, Panagiotou, Pikhurko and Taraz, we improve their results as follows: For $d \\geq 3$, we show that A. $χ_L(k,d)=\\infty$ for all $2\\le k\\le d$, B. $χ_{PL}(d+1,d)=\\infty$ and C. $χ_L(d+1,d)\\ge 3$ for all odd $d\\ge 3$. As an application, we extend the results by Lutz and Møller on the weak chromatic number of the $s$-dimensional faces in the triangulations of a fixed triangulable $d$-manifold $M$: D. $χ_s(M)=\\infty$ for $1\\leq s \\leq d$.",
