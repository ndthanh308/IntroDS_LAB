  abstract = {By sequentially adding line segments to a line or disks to a surface at random positions without overlaps, we obtain configurations of the one- and two-dimensional random sequential adsorption (RSA) problem. We have simulated the one- and two-dimensional problem with periodic boundary condition. The one-dimensional simulations are compared with the exact analytical solutions to give an estimate of the accuracy of the simulation. In two dimensions the geometrical properties of the RSA configuration are discussed and in addition known results of the RSA process are reproduced. Various statistical distributions of the Voronoi-Dirichlet (VD) network corresponding to the RSA disk configuration are analyzed. In order to characterize pores in the RSA configuration, we introduce circular holes. There is a direct correspondence between vertices of the VD network and these holes, and also between direct/indirect geometrical neighbors and these holes. The hole size distribution is found to be a parabola. We also find general relations that connect the asymptotic behavior of the surface coverage, the correlation function, and the hole size distribution.},

  abstract  = {The random-sequential adsorption of disks with two or more sizes onto a planar substrate has been investigated using computer simulations. For a binary mixture of large and small disks, we find that the large-disk coverage reaches its asymptotic value exponentially, while the small disk reaches its asymptotic value algebraically according to Feder�s law. For a uniform distribution of disk radii, the total coverage approaches its asymptotic value algebraically [?(?)-?(t)\~{}t\^{}\{ ?p\}, where ?(t) is the coverage at time t], but the characteristic exponent p has an effective value smaller than 1/2. If the distribution of disk radii from which the disks are selected for attempted addition is Gaussian, then the exponent p has a very small effective value, and the distribution of adsorbed disks becomes very non-Gaussian if the initial Gaussian distribution is broad. Many of our simulation results can be understood in terms of the theoretical work of Talbot, Tarjus, and Schaff [Phys. Rev. A 40, 4808 (1980)], but other aspects of this work are beyond current theoretical approaches.},

  abstract = {Random sequential adsorption (RSA) of polydisperse mixtures of hard and interacting spherical particles was analyzed. Theoretical results were derived by performing numerical MC simulations both for Gaussian and for continuous distributions of particle sizes characterized by standard deviations below 20\%. Adsorption kinetics of these mixtures was determined for a broad range of times showing that for $\tau$ < 5 the influence of polydispersity was rather minor for both Gauss and continuous particle size distributions. More significant deviations were predicted for the asymptotic adsorption regime close to jamming. In the case of continuous distributions this limiting kinetics could be described by the power law dependence $\theta$∞− $\theta$ ∼ $\tau$−1/3in accordance with the predictions of G. Tarjus and J. Talbot (1991, J. Phys. Math Gen.24,L913). The jamming concentration $\theta$∞for hard (noninteracting) particles was found to increase proportionally to $\sigma$. It was also shown that the polydispersity of particle mixtures can exert an effect on the structure of the adsorption layer (characterized in terms of the pair correlation function). The broadening of this function was confirmed experimentally by using colloid suspensions of spherical particles (polystyrene latex) characterized by $\sigma$ = 6–10\%.},
