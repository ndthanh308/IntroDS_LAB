  "abstract": "We extend the notion of F-rationality to other closure operations, inspired by the work of Smith, Epstein and Schwede, and Ma and Schwede, which describe F-rationality in terms of the canonical module and top local cohomology module. We give conditions for a closure operation cl on a Cohen-Macaulay complete local ring under which cl-rationality is equivalent to parameter ideals being cl-closed. We also demonstrate that full extended plus closure as defined by Heitmann and weak full extended plus closure as defined by the first named author have no big test elements.",
