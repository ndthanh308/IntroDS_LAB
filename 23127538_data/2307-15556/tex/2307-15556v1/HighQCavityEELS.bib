abstract = {The electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of quantum solids are determined by their low-energy (<100 meV) many-body excitations. Dynamical characterization and manipulation of such excitations rely on tools that combine nm-spatial, fsoral, and meV-spectral resolution. Currently, phonons and collective plasmon resonances can be imaged in nanostructures with atomic (sub-nm) and tens of meV space/energy resolution using state-of-the-art energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy (TEM), but only under static conditions, while fs-resolved measurements are common but lack spatial or energy resolution. Here, we demonstrate a new method of spectrally resolved photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (SRPINEM) that allows us to obtain nm-fs-resolved maps of nanoparticle plasmons with an energy resolution determined by the laser line width (20 meV in this work) and no longer limited by the electron beam and spectrometer energy spreading. This technique can be extended to any optically accessible low-energy mode, thus pushing TEM to a previously unattainable spectral domain with an unprecedented combination of space, energy, and temporal resolution.},

abstract = {The interplay between free electrons, light, and matter offers unique prospects for space, time, and energy resolved optical material characterization, structured light generation, and quantum information processing. Here, we study the nanoscale features of spontaneous and stimulated electron–photon interactions mediated by localized surface plasmon resonances at the tips of a gold nanostar using electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS), cathodoluminescence spectroscopy (CL), and photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM). Supported by numerical electromagnetic boundary-element method (BEM) calculations, we show that the different coupling mechanisms probed by EELS, CL, and PINEM feature the same spatial dependence on the electric field distribution of the tip modes. However, the electron–photon interaction strength is found to vary with the incident electron velocity, as determined by the spatial Fourier transform of the electric near-field component parallel to the electron trajectory. For the tightly confined plasmonic tip resonances, our calculations suggest an optimum coupling velocity at electron energies as low as a few keV. Our results are discussed in the context of more complex geometries supporting multiple modes with spatial and spectral overlap. We provide fundamental insights into spontaneous and stimulated electron-light-matter interactions with key implications for research on (quantum) coherent optical phenomena at the nanoscale.},

Yet to this day, all experiments involving free-electron-light interactions are fully explained by describing the light as a classical wave. We observed quantum statistics effects of photons on free-electron-light interactions. We demonstrate interactions that pass continuously from Poissonian to super-Poissonian and up to thermal statistics, revealing a transition from quantum walk to classical random walk on the free-electron energy ladder. The electron walker serves as the probe in nondestructive quantum detection, measuring the second-order photon-correlation g(2)(0) and higher-orders g(n)(0). Unlike conventional quantum-optical detectors, the electron can perform both quantum weak measurements and projective measurements by evolving into an entangled joint state with the photons. These findings inspire hitherto inaccessible concepts in quantum optics, including free-electron-based ultrafast quantum tomography of light.},

Electron microscopes currently offer the unparalleled ability of rendering spatially-resolved electron spectra with combined meV and sub-nm resolution, while the use of ultrafast optical pulses enables fs temporal resolution and exposure of the electrons to ultraintense confined optical fields. Here, we theoretically investigate fundamental aspects of the interaction of fast electrons with localized optical modes that are made possible by these advances. We use a quantum-optics description of the optical field to predict that the resulting electron spectra strongly depend on the statistics of the sample excitations (bosonic or fermionic) and their population (Fock, coherent, or thermal), whose autocorrelation functions are directly retrieved from the ratios of electron gain intensities. We further explore feasible experimental scenarios to probe the quantum characteristics of the sampled excitations and their populations.},

Ultrafast electron microscopy has recently made free-electron beams the subject of laser-based quantum manipulation and characterization 6–11 , enabling the observation of free-electron quantum walks 12–14 , attosecond electron pulses 10,15–17 and holographic electromagnetic imaging 18 . Chip-based photonics 19,20 promises unique applications in nanoscale quantum control and sensing but remains to be realized in electron microscopy. Here we merge integrated photonics with electron microscopy, demonstrating coherent phase modulation of a continuous electron beam using a silicon nitride microresonator. The high-finesse ( Q 0 ≈ 10 6 ) cavity enhancement and a waveguide designed for phase matching lead to efficient electron–light scattering at extremely low, continuous-wave optical powers. Specifically, we fully deplete the initial electron state at a cavity-coupled power of only 5.35 microwatts and generate >500 electron energy sidebands for several milliwatts. Moreover, we probe unidirectional intracavity fields with microelectronvolt resolution in electron-energy-gain spectroscopy 21 . The fibre-coupled photonic structures feature single-optical-mode electron–light interaction with full control over the input and output light. This approach establishes a versatile and highly efficient framework for enhanced electron beam control in the context of laser phase plates 22 , beam modulators and continuous-wave attosecond pulse trains 23 , resonantly enhanced spectroscopy 24–26 and dielectric laser acceleration 19,20,27 .

abstract = {Advances in the research of interactions between ultrafast free electrons and light have introduced a previously unknown kind of quantum matter, quantum free-electron wavepackets1–5. So far, studies of the interactions of cavity-confined light with quantum matter have focused on bound electron systems, such as atoms, quantum dots and quantum circuits, which are considerably limited by their fixed energy states, spectral range and selection rules. By contrast, quantum free-electron wavepackets have no such limits, but so far no experiment has shown the influence of a photonic cavity on quantum free-electron wavepackets. Here we develop a platform for multidimensional nanoscale imaging and spectroscopy of free-electron interactions with photonic cavities. We directly measure the cavity-photon lifetime via a coherent free-electron probe and observe an enhancement of more than an order of magnitude in the interaction strength relative to previous experiments of electron–photon interactions. Our free-electron probe resolves the spatiotemporal and energy–momentum information of the interaction. The quantum nature of the electrons is verified by spatially mapping Rabi oscillations of the electron spectrum. The interactions between free electrons and cavity photons could enable low-dose, ultrafast electron microscopy of soft matter or other beam-sensitive materials. Such interactions may also open paths towards using free electrons for quantum information processing and quantum sensing. Future studies could achieve free-electron strong coupling6,7, photon quantum state synthesis8 and quantum nonlinear phenomena such as cavity electro-optomechanics9.},

@article{Das2019,
abstract = {We report on a novel way of performing stimulated electron energy-loss and energy-gain spectroscopy (sEELS/sEEGS) experiments that does not require a pulsed gun. In this scheme, a regular scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) equipped with a conventional continuous electron gun is fitted with a modified EELS detector and a light injector in the object chamber. The modification of the EELS detector allows one to expose the EELS camera during tunable time intervals that can be synchronized with nanosecond laser pulses hitting the sample, therefore allowing us to collect only those electrons that have interacted with the sample under light irradiation. Using ∼ 5 ns laser pulses of ∼ 2 eV photon energy on various plasmonic silver samples, we obtain evidence of sEELS/sEEGS through the emergence of up to two loss and gain peaks in the spectra at ± 2 and ± 4 eV. Because this approach does not involve any modification of the gun, our method retains the original performances of the microscope in terms of energy resolution and spectral imaging with and without light injection. Compared to pulsed-gun techniques, our method is mainly limited to a perturbative regime (typically no more that one gain event per incident electron), which allows us to observe resonant effects, in particular when the plasmon energy of a silver nanostructure matches the laser photon energy. In this situation, EELS and EEGS signals are enhanced in proportion to n+1 and n, respectively, where n is the average plasmon population due to the external illumination. The n term is associated with stimulated loss and gain processes, and the term of 1 corresponds to conventional (spontaneous) loss. The EELS part of the spectrum is therefore an incoherent superposition of spontaneous and stimulated EEL events. This is confirmed by a proper quantum-mechanical description of the electron/light/plasmon system incorporating light–plasmon and plasmon–electron interactions, as well as inelastic plasmon decay.},

abstract = {The unique optical properties of surface plasmon resonances in nanostructured materials have attracted considerable attention, broadly impacting both fundamental research and applied technologies ranging from sensing and optoelectronics to quantum computing. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in the transmission electron microscope has revealed valuable information about the full plasmonic spectrum of these materials with nanoscale spatial resolution. Here we report a novel approach for experimentally accessing the photon-stimulated electron energy-gain and stimulated electron energy-loss responses of individual plasmonic nanoparticles via the simultaneous irradiation of a continuous wave laser and continuous current, monochromated electron probe. Stimulated gain and loss probabilities are equivalent and increase linearly in the low-irradiance range of 0.5 × 108 to 4 × 108 W/m2, above which excessive heating reduces the observed probabilities; importantly in our low-irradiance regime, the photon energy must be tuned in resonance with the plasmon energy for the stimulated gain and loss peaks to emerge. Theoretical modeling based on Fermi's golden rule elucidates how the plasmon resonantly and coherently shuttles energy quanta between the electron probe and the radiation field and vice versa in stimulated electron energy-loss and -gain events. This study opens a fundamentally new approach to explore the quantum physics of excited-state plasmon resonances that does not rely on high-intensity laser pulses or any modification to the EELS detector.},

abstract = {In materials science and biology, optical near-field microscopies enable spatial resolutions beyond the diffraction limit, but they cannot provide the atomic-scale imaging capabilities of electron microscopy. Given the nature of interactions between electrons and photons, and considering their connections through nanostructures, it should be possible to achieve imaging of evanescent electromagnetic fields with electron pulses when such fields are resolved in both space (nanometre and below) and time (femtosecond). Here we report the development of photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM), and the associated phenomena. We show that the precise spatiotemporal overlap of femtosecond single-electron packets with intense optical pulses at a nanostructure (individual carbon nanotube or silver nanowire in this instance) results in the direct absorption of integer multiples of photon quanta (n) by the relativistic electrons accelerated to 200 keV. By energy-filtering only those electrons resulting from this absorption, it is possible to image directly in space the near-field electric field distribution, obtain the temporal behaviour of the field on the femtosecond timescale, and map its spatial polarization dependence. We believe that the observation of the photon-induced near-field effect in ultrafast electron microscopy demonstrates the potential for many applications, including those of direct space-time imaging of localized fields at interfaces and visualization of phenomena related to photonics, plasmonics and nanostructures. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {An analytical expression for the energy loss suffered by a fast electron passing near a homogeneous dielectric sphere is derived within a fully relativistic approach. The sphere is described by a frequency-dependent dielectric function. The electromagnetic field induced by the passage of the electron is then obtained by expressing the solution of Maxwell's equations for this geometry in terms of the scattering of the multipole expansion of the incoming electromagnetic field at the sphere. The energy loss is derived from the induced field acting back on the electron. The variation of the energy-loss spectra with both the radius of the sphere and the impact parameter of the electron trajectory is studied in detail. Part of the energy loss is transformed into radiation, which is also investigated. For spheres characterized by real dielectric functions, like those of ionic materials in the transparency-frequency region, it is shown that the entire energy loss is transformed into radiation. Examples of loss spectra and radiation emission spectra are given for a material described by a Drude-like dielectric function (e.g., Al) and for (Formula presented) {\textcopyright} 1999 The American Physical Society.},

abstract = {We investigated the optical properties of localized surface plasmons with different orders in individual silver nanotriangles with different sizes by electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and cathodoluminescence (CL) in the same scanning transmission electron microscope. EELS and CL spectral imaging within the same nanotriangles give information about the extinction and scattering from the nanostructures. As measured from both techniques, the first two order modes showed similar spatial distributions. However, the appearances of slightly different resonant energies were confirmed in both lower and higher order plasmon modes. For the first two lower order modes, the resonant energy in CL was blue-shifted compared to that in EELS, which can be understood in a simple damped oscillator picture. This confirms the experimental and theoretical observations recently made on dipolar plasmons in gold. It also extends it to the second-order modes. The next higher order modes exhibit an apparent inverted shift, which could not fit in such a picture. On the basis of boundary element methods numerical simulations, we interpret this apparent inversion of shift as a combined effect of (1) the spectral mixing of higher order modes and (2) the change in the relative weights of higher order modes between both spectroscopy techniques, i.e., the much faster drop in higher order mode intensity in CL compared to EELS. Both effects are enhanced by the large damping in these imperfect, lithographed structures.},

  abstract        = {Endocytosis, like many dynamic cellular processes, requires precise temporal and spatial orchestration of complex protein machinery to mediate membrane budding. To understand how this machinery works, we directly correlated fluorescence microscopy of key protein pairs with electron tomography. We systematically located 211 endocytic intermediates, assigned each to a specific time window in endocytosis, and reconstructed their ultrastructure in 3D. The resulting virtual ultrastructural movie defines the protein-mediated membrane shape changes during endocytosis in budding yeast. It reveals that clathrin is recruited to flat membranes and does not initiate curvature. Instead, membrane invagination begins upon actin network assembly followed by amphiphysin binding to parallel membrane segments, which promotes elongation of the invagination into a tubule. Scission occurs on average 9 s after initial bending when invaginations are ∼100 nm deep, releasing nonspherical vesicles with 6,400 nm2 mean surface area. Direct correlation of protein dynamics with ultrastructure provides a quantitative 4D resource. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Coherent manipulation of quantum systems with light is expected to be a cornerstone of future information and communication technology, including quantum computation and cryptography. The transfer of an optical phase onto a quantum wavefunction is a defining aspect of coherent interactions and forms the basis of quantum state preparation, synchronization and metrology. Light-phase-modulated electron states near atoms and molecules are essential for the techniques of attosecond science, including the generation of extreme-ultraviolet pulses and orbital tomography. In contrast, the quantum-coherent phase-modulation of energetic free-electron beams has not been demonstrated, although it promises direct access to ultrafast imaging and spectroscopy with tailored electron pulses on the attosecond scale. Here we demonstrate the coherent quantum state manipulation of free-electron populations in an electron microscope beam. We employ the interaction of ultrashort electron pulses with optical near-fields to induce Rabi oscillations in the populations of electron momentum states, observed as a function of the optical driving field. Excellent agreement with the scaling of an equal-Rabi multilevel quantum ladder is obtained, representing the observation of a light-driven 'quantum walk' coherently reshaping electron density in momentum space. We note that, after the interaction, the optically generated superposition of momentum states evolves into a train of attosecond electron pulses. Our results reveal the potential of quantum control for the precision structuring of electron densities, with possible applications ranging from ultrafast electron spectroscopy and microscopy to accelerator science and free-electron lasers.},

Moreover, photon maps have been obtained in a scanning mode and they indicate that those peaks correspond to the multipole modes of electromagnetic oscillations in metallic spheres (Mie resonances). The spectral shape of the emission and the dependence on particle size, impact parameter, and electron energy are well explained from theoretical calculations of the photon emission probability derived from a fully retarded analytical treatment of the interaction of fast electrons with metallic spheres.},

abstract = {Free electron beams such as those employed in electron microscopes have evolved into powerful tools to investigate photonic nanostructures with an unrivaled combination of spatial and spectral precision through the analysis of electron energy losses and cathodoluminescence light emission. In combination with ultrafast optics, the emerging field of ultrafast electron microscopy utilizes synchronized femtosecond electron and light pulses that are aimed at the sampled structures, holding the promise to bring simultaneous sub-{\AA}-sub-fs-sub-meV space-time-energy resolution to the study of material and optical-field dynamics. In addition, these advances enable the manipulation of the wave function of individual free electrons in unprecedented ways, opening sound prospects to probe and control quantum excitations at the nanoscale. Here, we provide an overview of photonics research based on free electrons, supplemented by original theoretical insights and discussion of several stimulating challenges and opportunities. In particular, we show that the excitation probability by a single electron is independent of its wave function, apart from a classical average over the transverse beam density profile, whereas the probability for two or more modulated electrons depends on their relative spatial arrangement, thus reflecting the quantum nature of their interactions. We derive first-principles analytical expressions that embody these results and have general validity for arbitrarily shaped electrons and any type of electron-sample interaction. We conclude with some perspectives on various exciting directions that include disruptive approaches to noninvasive spectroscopy and microscopy, the possibility of sampling the nonlinear optical response at the nanoscale, the manipulation of the density matrices associated with free electrons and optical sample modes, and appealing applications in optical modulation of electron beams, all of which could potentially revolutionize the use of free electrons in photonics.},

abstract = {By recording the lifespan of optical excitations from their creation to their decay in the far-field, photoluminescence excitation spectroscopy (PLE) is crucial in the understanding the optical properties in materials, and therefore indispensable in devices design and optimization. The investigation of materials in general would benefit from an analogous technique, but with nanoscale spatial resolution. By coincidentally measuring the energy loss of a relativistic electron of optical materials (plasmonic nanoparticles, luminescent 2D materials) and their subsequent light emission, we demonstrate the possibility of making cathodoluminescence excitation spectroscopy, a natural counterpart of PLE with a resolution better than 40 nm. The information retrieved should prove invaluable for understanding material optics at the nanometer scale.},

The level of enhancement strongly depends on microscopic details of the sample that are generally missed by macroscopic techniques.

Specifically, we use electron beam milling to accurately and iteratively change the nanowire length, followed by electron energy-loss spectroscopy to reveal the plasmon-enhanced vibrational features of h-BN. This allows us to investigate otherwise hidden bulk phonons and observe strong plasmon-phonon coupling.

Although they strongly influence the optical and thermal behavior of nanomaterials, no technique has been able to reveal the complete three-dimensional (3D) vectorial picture of their electromagnetic density of states. Using a highly monochromated electron beam in a scanning transmission electron microscope, we could visualize varying SPhP signatures from nanoscale MgO cubes as a function of the beam position, energy loss, and tilt angle. The SPhPs' response was described in terms of eigenmodes and used to tomographically reconstruct the phononic surface electromagnetic fields of the object.

abstract = {Whispering gallery mode resonators (WGMRs) trap light over many optical periods using total internal reflection. Thereby, they host multiple narrowband circulating modes that find applications in quantum electrodynamics, optomechanics, sensing and lasing. The spherical symmetry and low field leakage of dielectric microspheres make it difficult to probe their high-quality optical modes using far-field radiation. However, local field enhancement from metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) placed at the edge of the resonators can interface the optical far-field and the bounded cavity modes. In this work, we study the interaction between whispering gallery modes and the MNP surface plasmons with nanometric spatial resolution by using electron-beam spectroscopies in a scanning transmission electron microscope. We show that gallery modes are induced over the spectral range of the dipolar plasmons of the nanoparticle. Additionally, we explore the dependence of the transverse electric and transverse magnetic polarization of the induced gallery mode on the induced dipole moment of the MNP. Our study demonstrates a viable mechanism to effectively excite high-quality-factor whispering gallery modes and holds potential for applications in optical sensing and light manipulation.},

A key missing element for complete control is a direct spatial correlation of optical response to nanoscale modifications due to the large gap in spatial resolution between optical spectroscopy and nanometer-resolved techniques. Here, we bridge this gap by obtaining nanometer-resolved optical properties using electron spectroscopy at cryogenic temperatures, specifically electron energy loss spectroscopy for absorption and cathodoluminescence for emission, which are then directly correlated to chemical and structural information. In an h-BN/WS2/h-BN heterostructure, we observe local modulation of the trion (X-) emission due to tens of nanometer wide dielectric patches. Trion emission also increases in regions where charge accumulation occurs, close to the carbon film supporting the heterostructures.

The efficiency of this interaction relies on the coupling strength per photon along the interaction length. We predict an optimum value of 0.4266, resulting in the maximum energy gain of 28.27 keV for an optical pulse energy of only 0.22 nJ and duration 1 ps. The acceleration gradient is 1.05 GeV/m, which is lower than the maximum imposed by the damage threshold of Si waveguides. Our scheme shows how the coupling efficiency and energy gain can be maximized without maximizing the acceleration gradient.

The ratio Q/V determines the strength of the various cavity interactions, and an ultra-small cavity enables large-scale integration and single-mode operation for a broad range of wavelengths. However, a high-Q cavity of optical wavelength size is difficult to fabricate, as radiation loss increases in inverse proportion to cavity size. With the exception of a few recent theoretical studies, definitive theories and experiments for creating high-Q nanocavities have not been extensively investigated. Here we use a silicon-based two-dimensional photonic-crystal slab to fabricate a nanocavity with Q = 45,000 and V = 7.0 × 10-14 cm3; the value of Q/Vis 10-100 times larger than in previous studies. Underlying this development is the realization that light should be confined gently in order to be confined strongly. Integration with other photonic elements is straightforward, and a large free spectral range of 100 nm has been demonstrated.},

More precisely, we predict multiple excitations of a single confined plasmon mode in graphene nanostructures. These unprecedentedly large electron-plasmon couplings are explained using a simple scaling law and further investigated through a general quantum description of the electron-plasmon interaction. From a fundamental viewpoint, multiple plasmon excitations by a single electron provide a unique platform for exploring the bosonic quantum nature of these collective modes. Not only does our study open a viable path toward multiple excitation of a single plasmon mode by a single electron, but it also reveals electron probes as ideal tools for producing, detecting, and manipulating plasmons in graphene nanostructures. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {Nowadays, sub-50 meV atom-wide electron probes are routinely produced for electron energy loss spectroscopy in transmission electron microscopes due to monochromator technology advances. We review how gradual improvements in energy resolution enabled the study of very low-energy excitations such as lattice phonons, molecular vibrations, infrared plasmons and strongly coupled hybrid modes in nanomaterials. Starting with the theoretical framework needed to treat inelastic electron scattering from phonons in solids, we illustrate contributions in detecting optical surface phonons in photonic structures. We discuss phonon mapping capabilities in real and reciprocal space, and the localized phonon response near nano-/atomic-scale structural features. We also survey the progress of aloof spectroscopy in studying vibrations in organic materials and applications in measuring local temperature and photonic density of states in single nanostructures using phonon scattering. We then turn towards studies on infrared plasmons in metals and semiconductors. Spectroscopy analyses now extend towards probing extremely complex broadband platforms, the effects of defects and nanogaps, and some far-reaching investigations towards uncovering plasmon lifetime and 3D photonic density of states. In doped semiconductors, we review research on the use of the electron probe to correlate local doping concentration and atomic-scale defects with the plasmonic response. Finally, we discuss advances in studying strong coupling phenomena in plasmon-exciton and plasmon-phonon systems. Overall, the wealth of information gained extends our knowledge about nanomaterial properties and elementary excitations, illustrating the powerful capabilities of high-energy resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy-electron energy loss spectrometry.},

abstract = {Plasmonic crystals are well known to have band structure including a band gap, enabling the control of surface plasmon propagation and confinement. The band dispersion relation of bulk crystals has been generally measured by momentum-resolved spectroscopy using far field optical techniques while the defects introduced in the crystals have separately been investigated by near field imaging techniques so far. Particularly, defect related energy levels introduced in the plasmonic band gap have not been observed experimentally. In order to investigate such a localized mode, we performed electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) on a point defect introduced in a plasmonic crystal made up of flat cylinders protruding out of a metal film and arranged on a triangular lattice. The energy level of the defect mode was observed to lie within the full band-gap energy range. This was confirmed by a momentum-resolved EELS measurement of the band gap performed on the same plasmonic crystal. Furthermore, we experimentally and theoretically investigated the emergence of the defect states by starting with a corral of flat cylinders protrusions and adding sequentially additional shells of those in order to eventually form a plasmonic band-gap crystal encompassing a single point defect. It is demonstrated that a defectlike state already forms with a crystal made up of only two shells.},

Interestingly, in reduced dimensionality, the properties of free-electron radiation are predicted to fundamentally change. Here, we present the first observation of Cherenkov surface waves, wherein free electrons emit narrow-bandwidth photonic quasiparticles propagating in two dimensions. The low dimensionality and narrow bandwidth of the effect enable us to identify quantized emission events through electron energy loss spectroscopy. Our results support the recent theoretical prediction that free electrons do not always emit classical light and can instead become entangled with the photons they emit. The two-dimensional Cherenkov interaction achieves quantum coupling strengths over 2 orders of magnitude larger than ever reported, reaching the single-electron-single-photon interaction regime for the first time with free electrons. Our findings pave the way to previously unexplored phenomena in free-electron quantum optics, facilitating bright, free-electron-based quantum emitters of heralded Fock states.},

The chosen algorithm is based on an iterative calculation of the maximum likelihood solution known to be very robust against small errors in the PSF used. Restorations have been performed on diamond and graphite C-K edges acquired with an initial energy resolution of around I eV. After reconstruction, the sharp core exciton lines become clearly visible for both compounds and the final energy resolution is estimated to be about 200-300 meV. In the case of graphite, restorations involving both energy resolution and angular resolution have been successfully conducted.

The physics and technology of this approach is reviewed, which is referred to as dielectric laser acceleration (DLA). In the DLA scheme operating at typical laser pulse lengths of 0.1 to 1 ps, the laser damage fluences for robust dielectric materials correspond to peak surface electric fields in the GV/m regime. The corresponding accelerating field enhancement represents a potential reduction in active length of the accelerator between 1 and 2 orders of magnitude. Power sources for DLA-based accelerators (lasers) are less costly than microwave sources (klystrons) for equivalent average power levels due to wider availability and private sector investment. Because of the high laser-to-particle coupling efficiency, required pulse energies are consistent with tabletop microJoule class lasers. Combined with the very high (MHz) repetition rates these lasers can provide, the DLA approach appears promising for a variety of applications, including future high-energy physics colliders, compact light sources, and portable medical scanners and radiative therapy machines.},

  abstract        = {Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) can be formulated as a minimization problem with bound constraints. Although bound-constrained optimization has been studied extensively in both theory and practice, so far no study has formally applied its techniques to NMF. In this letter, we propose two projected gradient methods for NMF, both of which exhibit strong optimization properties. We discuss efficient implementations and demonstrate that one of the proposed methods converges faster than the popular multiplicative update approach. A simple Matlab code is also provided. {\textcopyright} 2007 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

abstract = {Cathodoluminescence (CL) is a powerful tool for the investigation of optical properties of materials. In recent years, its combination with scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) has demonstrated great success in unveiling new physics in the field of plasmonics and quantum emitters. Most of these results were not imaginable even twenty years ago, due to conceptual and technical limitations. The purpose of this review is to present the recent advances that broke these limitations, and the new possibilities offered by the modern STEM-CL technique. We first introduce the different STEM-CL operating modes and the technical specificities in STEM-CL instrumentation. Two main classes of optical excitations, namely the coherent one (typically plasmons) and the incoherent one (typically light emission from quantum emitters) are investigated with STEM-CL. For these two main classes, we describe both the physics of light production under electron beam irradiation and the physical basis for interpreting STEM-CL experiments. We then compare STEM-CL with its better known sister techniques: scanning electron microscope CL, photoluminescence, and electron energy-loss spectroscopy. We finish by comprehensively reviewing recent STEM-CL applications.},
