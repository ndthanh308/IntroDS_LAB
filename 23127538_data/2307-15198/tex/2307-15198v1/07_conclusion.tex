\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:con} 

This paper introduces a novel unified framework, called JERS, for one-shot joint extraction, registration and segmentation.
In contrast to prior research, our proposed method seamlessly integrates the three tasks into a single system, enabling joint optimization.
Specifically, JERS contains a group of collective extraction, registration and segmentation modules.
These three modules help each other boost extraction, registration, and segmentation performance with only one labeled template available.
Furthermore, our method facilitates incremental progress for each task, thereby enhancing the overall performance to a greater extent.
The experimental results substantiate that JERS not only surpasses state-of-the-art approaches in terms of extraction, registration, and segmentation accuracy but also exhibits high robustness and time-efficiency.
