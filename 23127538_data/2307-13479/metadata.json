  "abstract": "This paper investigates the relation between the almost Gorenstein properties for graded rings and for local rings. Once $R$ is an almost Gorenstein graded ring, the localization $R_M$ of $R$ at the graded maximal ideal $M$ is almost Gorenstein as a local ring. The converse does not hold true in general. However, it does for one-dimensional graded domains with mild conditions, which we clarify in the present paper. We explore the defining ideals of almost Gorenstein numerical semigroup rings as well.",
