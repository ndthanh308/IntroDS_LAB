  "abstract": "In this paper, we conduct a holistic exploration of the Universal Decompositional Semantic (UDS) Parsing. We first introduce a cascade model for UDS parsing that decomposes the complex parsing task into semantically appropriate subtasks. Our approach outperforms the prior models, while significantly reducing inference time. We also incorporate syntactic information and further optimized the architecture. Besides, different ways for data augmentation are explored, which further improve the UDS Parsing. Lastly, we conduct experiments to investigate the efficacy of ChatGPT in handling the UDS task, revealing that it excels in attribute parsing but struggles in relation parsing, and using ChatGPT for data augmentation yields suboptimal results.
