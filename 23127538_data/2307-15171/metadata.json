  "abstract": "The LHCb detector's forward geometry provides unprecedented kinematic coverage at low Bjorken-$x$. LHCb's excellent momentum resolution, vertex reconstruction, and particle identification enable precision measurements at low transverse momentum and high rapidity in proton-lead collisions, probing $x$ as small as $10^{-6}$. In this contribution, we present recent studies of low-$x$ physics using the LHCb detector. These studies include charged hadron, neutral pion, and $D^0$ production in proton-lead collisions, as well as charmonium production in ultraperipheral lead-lead collisions. Future prospects and implications for the understanding of low-$x$ nuclear PDFs and parton saturation are also discussed.",
