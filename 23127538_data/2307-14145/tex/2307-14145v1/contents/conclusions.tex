\section{Conclusions}
Supported by \texttt{RxInfer} or a similar toolbox, future AI engineers will no longer design end-product algorithms, but will instead design the designers (AIF agents) of production algorithms in short and easy-readable code scripts. Along with \cite{friston_designing_2022}, we think that the potential benefits of shared intelligence in ecosystems of  communicating AIF agents are hard to overstate. As we have argued in this position paper, the required underlying technology for realizing this vision is very demanding and currently not yet available. Still, we also think it is not out of reach and is one of the most exciting ongoing research threads in the AI field.
