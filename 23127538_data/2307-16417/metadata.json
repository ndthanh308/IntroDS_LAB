  "abstract": "Diabetes mellitus is a disease which is currently a huge health hazard globally. The cases of diabetes had increased by a significant amount in past decades. Also it has been predicted that it will further increase in future. Diabetes depends on various factors like obesity, physical inactivity. Also diabetes can depend on various environmental issues. In this article, our main focus is to study the dependence of the diabetic cases on the air pollution. We have used the data for diabetic population and PM2.5 concentration in the air for five countries from 2010 to 2021. Here we have studied the correlation between the diabetic cases data and PM2.5 concentration data. Also, we have done the linear regression analysis to find whether this correlation is statistically significant.",
