\captionof{figure}{\textbf{\methodname: learns a General Car-NeRF from Infinite Car Images in the wild}. We extract car patches from unconstrained internet images using an off-the-shelf 2D object detector \cite{wu2019detectron2}. To preprocess the patches, we generate rough camera intrinsics, object instance masks, and 3D detection bounding boxes using a monocular 3D object detector \cite{dd3d} and a pixel-level segmenter \cite{SAM}. Our Car-NeRF model takes the preprocessed information as input and learns from a unified canonical car model with 3D bounding boxes and pixel-level masks to output a high-quality car image from any 3D viewpoint based on a single-view image.
