We have not found in the literature related work proposing collaborative environments with a focus on the Edge-to-Cloud Continuum. Closer solutions to KheOps, but without focusing on the Computing Continuum, are Google Colab~\cite{colab}, Kaggle~\cite{kaggle}, and Code Ocean~\cite{clyburne2019computational} as presented in Section~\ref{sec:limitations}.

KheOps differs from Google Colab, Kaggle, and Code Ocean mainly regarding the features presented in Table~\ref{tbl:limitations} (limitations) such as the access to heterogeneous Edge-to-Cloud resources; access to large-scale infrastructures; and supporting the experiment repeatability and reproducibility on the same hardware setup and replicability in different infrastructures. In addition, KheOps relies on open scientific testbeds (\emph{e.g.,} Grid5000, FIT IoT LAB, Chameleon, and CHI@Edge) that are highly reconfigurable and controllable and designed to support reproducible experiments.
