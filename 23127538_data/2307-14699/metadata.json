  "abstract": "We show that the Korenblum maximum (domination) principle is valid for weighted Bergman spaces $A^p_w$ with arbitrary (non-negative and integrable) radial weights $w$ in the case $1\\le p<\\infty$. We also notice that in every weighted Bergman space the supremum of all radii for which the principle holds is strictly smaller than one. Under the mild additional assumption $\\liminf_{r\\to 0^+} w(r)>0$, we show that the principle fails whenever $0<p<1$.",
