  "abstract": "Recently emerged technologies based on Deep Learning (DL) achieved outstanding results on a variety of tasks in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, these encounter several challenges related to robustness to adversarial inputs, ecological impact, and the necessity of huge amounts of training data. In response, researchers are focusing more and more interest on biologically grounded mechanisms, which are appealing due to the impressive capabilities exhibited by biological brains. This survey explores a range of these biologically inspired models of synaptic plasticity, their application in DL scenarios, and the connections with models of plasticity in Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs). Overall, Bio-Inspired Deep Learning (BIDL) represents an exciting research direction, aiming at advancing not only our current technologies but also our understanding of intelligence.",
