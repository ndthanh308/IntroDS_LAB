This work builds directly on~\cite{Bocchi2019} and provides a new typing system that allows \emph{mixed-choice} to be described by types, and therefore enabling processes to perform timeouts.
These new types are proven to be exhibit progress (deadlock freedom), and the extension to the process calculus is proven to fully reduce.
