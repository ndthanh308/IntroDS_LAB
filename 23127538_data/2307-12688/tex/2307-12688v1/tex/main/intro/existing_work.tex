\subsection{Session Types \& Mixed-Choices}
While mixed-choice have been successfully introduced in the synchronous scenario~\cite{Vasconcelos2020}, asynchronous mixed-choice have largely remained partially, if not wholly disallowed by most definitions.
%
The work of~\cite{Denielou2012a} is able to model a subset of mixed-choice which allow the ordering of messages to be interleaved, when communication is not half-duplex, by \emph{forking} a process into various subprocesses which may perform their actions independently before \emph{joining} together and continuing as one process.
%
In work adjacent to session types~\cite{Berger2007}, timers have been used timers to model mixed-choice, by allowing a silent internal transition to another state after a certain amount of time.
%
Other approaches to modelling mixed-choice are often similar, requiring a silent transition between internal states without mixed-choice.
