    Mixed-choice has long been barred from models of asynchronous communication since it compromises key properties of communicating finite-state machines.
    %
    Session types inherit this restriction, which precludes them from fully modelling timeouts -- a key programming feature to handle failures.
    %
    %
    %
    To address this deficiency, we present (binary) TimeOut Asynchronous Session Types ({TOAST}) as an extension to (binary) asynchronous timed session types to permit mixed-choice.
    %
    {TOAST} deploy timing constraints to regulate the use of mixed-choice so as to preserve communication safety.
    % and ensure that a participant in a given session cannot simultaneously send and receive.
    %
    % This inhibits mixed-choice incurring a communication mismatch.
    %
    We provide a new behavioural semantics for {TOAST} which guarantees progress in the presence of mixed-choice.
    %
    Building upon {TOAST}, we provide a calculus featuring process timers which is capable of modelling timeouts using a $\mathtt{receive\text{-}after}$ pattern, much like Erlang,
    and informally illustrate the correspondence with TOAST specifications.
    %  to model timeouts, and can never reach a $\mathtt{failed}$ state.

Timeouts are commonplace in web-technologies and asynchronous communication, but have not been accurately implementing in existing models such as session types.
%
In fact, timeouts are a fundamental requirement of \SMTP\ clients as specified by the Internet Standards in \RFC*~\cite[Section~4.5.3.2]{RFC5321}:
\emph{``An \SMTP\ client \emph{must} provide a timeout mechanism''}, which continues to detail the required timeouts of various cases, ranging between 2 and 10 minutes.
%
Mixed-choice are standard features of higher-level automata, but have become disallowed as standard since the requirements of decidable \CFSM\ were proven~\cite{Gouda1984}, and continue to be widely excluded from asynchronous communication models such as session types.
%
Mixed-choice are able to encapsulate the behaviour of timeouts.
Conveniently, it appears that the timed setting can provide the necessary constraints that allow mixed-choice while preserving communication safety, deadlock freedom and ultimately progress.
%
This work provides an extension to asynchronous timed session types~\cite{Bocchi2019} that allows for mixed-choice while preserving preserving communication safety and proof of progress.
