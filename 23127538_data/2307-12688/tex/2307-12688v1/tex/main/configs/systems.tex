System configurations are composed of two distinct social configurations, \SocCfg*_1\ and \SocCfg*_2, running in parallel: \CfgSys*. The rules given in~\cref{fig:configs_sys_rule} reveal the following high-level control flow of a system
\begin{inline}>
	\item \dots
	\item \LblCfgSysWait*
	\item \LblCfgSysLComm*
	\item \LblCfgSysLPar*
	\item \dots
\end{inline}\etc\ .
Describing there being some time to wait \ValTime*\ until a communication between the two parties can occur, which results in the message being received by a queue; at which point the message can be retrieved from the queue and received by the configuration. This cycle continues indefinitely until either both types terminate or a deadlock is reached.
\input{tex/figs/configs/rule_sys.tex}
Rule \LblCfgSysLComm*\ specifies that both configurations can make transitions to new configurations when one performs a transition via \LblCfgSocSend*\ and the other by \LblCfgSocEnqu*; for example:
\begin{minieq}
	\Par[\CfgSoc_1][\CfgSoc_2]
	\;\Act[\SiltAction]\,
	\Par[\CfgSoc_{1}''][\CfgSoc1{\ValClocks_2}2{\TypeS_2}3{\Queue_2;\Msg}]
\end{minieq}
While rule \LblCfgSysLPar*\ describes one party successfully receiving a message from their queue by a transition via \LblCfgSocRecv*.

Rule \LblCfgSysWait*\ allows time to pass evenly over the entire system, requiring both participants to make a transition via \LblCfgSocTime*\ of the same value of \ValTime*. The amount of time \ValTime*\ is restricted to the greatest value shared by both parties by the premise of their respective \LblCfgSocTime*\ transitions. This ensures that time passes evenly for separate participants, effectively halting time for the whole system once a participant has no choice but to perform an action.

\subsubsection{Ensuring System Compatibility}\label{sssec:configs_sys_compatibility}
Given a system composed of configurations with dual well-formed types, there is the potential for the system to exhibit \emph{communication safety} and deadlock freedom.
However, this is not guaranteed just by types being well-formed, but must be ensured by their defined behaviour.

Naturally, the rules of~\cref{fig:configs_iso_rule,fig:configs_soc_rule,fig:configs_sys_rule} specify that messages must be sent my one party before being received by another.
Furthermore, sending actions exhibit a \emph{relaxed} notion of urgency, by the premise of \LblCfgSocTime*, which specifies that a value of time may pass, delaying the sending of messages in order to accumulate as many viable actions as possible, so long as no opportunities for sending a message are missed.
Given that a receiving party is composed of dual types, a message that is delayed will still be successfully received.

Conversely, receiving actions \emph{must} exhibit urgency, as a message existing in a queue indicates that the sender has already progressed to some later type. Consider the trace of a type in~\cref{eq:example_configs_sys_compatability}.
\begin{minieq}\label{eq:example_configs_sys_compatability}
	\TypAct1{\TypSend}2{\mathtt{e}}
	\TypCond1{\Clx<3}2{\Clx}
	.
	\TypAct1{\TypRecv}2{\mathtt{f}}
	\TypCond1{\Clx=0}2{\emptyset}
	\dots
\end{minieq}
In the instance where the sending of \texttt{e} is delayed until the last possible moment $\Clx=2.9$, any delay of its dual counterpart would result in \texttt{f} being send too late. \TODO[note cite?]
\begin{note}
	In this work latency over a network is not considered, but may be accounted for in implementations.
\end{note}

For this reason, \LblCfgSocTime*\ does not allow time to pass for a configuration if there is a message waiting to be received. Additionally, receive urgency ensures that the clocks of each participant are kept synchronised as they progress.
This notion of compatibility is formally defined in~\cref{def:configs_compat}; an explanation of each condition is as follows
\begin{inline}*+;
	\item only one participant may receive messages at any time
	\item compatibility is preserved as messages are received
	\item both initial configurations of a system and systems in waiting are compatible, with both having matching clock valuations and dual types
\end{inline}
\input{tex/defs/configs/sys/compat.tex}
In practice conditions 2 and 3 are of interest, as it reflects the control flow of a system described at the beginning of~\cref{ssec:configs_sys} where a system has either
\begin{inline}|;
	\item performed a \LblCfgSysLComm*\ leading to a subsequent \LblCfgSysLPar*, following condition 2
	\item no interactions are possible, meaning only time may pass via \LblCfgSysWait*, following condition 3
\end{inline}
Additionally, condition 2 of compatibility supports situations where one participant sends several messages in succession without the other participant receiving them. This is valid behaviour.
