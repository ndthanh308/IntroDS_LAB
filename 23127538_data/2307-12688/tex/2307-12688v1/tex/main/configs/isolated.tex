Isolated configurations capture the behaviour of types without any influences beyond itself. All transitions reflect local actions, hidden to anything but itself.
An isolated configuration \CfgIso*\ is a tuple comprised of a valuation of clocks \ValClocks*\ and type \TypeS*, and may be written as \IsoCfg*.
\begin{note}
    Any configuration with a transition $\IsoCfg\Act\IsoCfg'$ may be written as $\IsoCfg\Act$, to mean that there exists some possible transition \ProgAction*\ such that a new configuration \IsoCfg*'\ can be reached.
\end{note}
The semantics of isolated configurations is presented in~\cref{fig:configs_iso_rule}.
\input{tex/figs/configs/rule_iso.tex}
Rule \LblCfgIsoUnfold*\ handles recursive types, unfolding them by substituting any occurrence of the corresponding call \CfgRecDef*, in the proceeding type \TypeS*, with the sequence of types between \TypeS*\ and any recursive call \CfgRecDef*. The resulting type \TypeS*'\ may be some intermediate type between the recursive definition and a corresponding call.
Rule \LblCfgIsoTick*\ allows time to pass over the clocks.

The \LblCfgIsoInteract*\ rule allows a configuration to perform any interaction with constraints satisfied by the current valuation of clocks. The resulting configuration has the type \TypeS*_j\ corresponding to the interaction performed, along with any conditional resets being applied to \ValClocks*.
