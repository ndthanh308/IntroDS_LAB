Building upon the notion of well-formed types (\cref{def:types_well_formed}), a well-formed configuration exhibits behaviour without deadlocks, where there is always some action able to be performed in the future, until the termination type is reached.
This behaviour is referred to as \emph{liveness}, and is given in~\cref{def:configs_iso_live}, and depends on \emph{future enabled} actions.
\input{tex/defs/configs/iso/future_en.tex}
\input{tex/defs/configs/iso/live.tex}
The liveness of a configuration indicates whether a deadlock has been reached. There must either be an action immediately viable, some future enabled actions, or the type must have reached termination.
\input{tex/defs/configs/iso/well_formed.tex}
Given a type \TypeS*\ well-formed against \ValClocks*, it holds that a configuration of \IsoCfg*\ will have future enabled actions, and therefore be live.
\begin{note}
    For a \emph{well-formed} \TypeS*, \CfgIso*1{\ValClocks_{0}} is \emph{live}.
\end{note}
