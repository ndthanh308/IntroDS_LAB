%Given a system composed of configurations with dual well-formed types, there is the potential for the system to exhibit \emph{communication safety} and deadlock freedom.
%However, this is not guaranteed just by types being well-formed, but must be ensured by their defined behaviour.

%Naturally, the rules of~\cref{fig:configs_iso_rule,fig:configs_soc_rule,fig:configs_sys_rule} specify that messages must be sent my one party before being received by another.
%Furthermore, sending actions exhibit a \emph{relaxed} notion of urgency, by the premise of \LblCfgSocTime*, which specifies that a value of time may pass, delaying the sending of messages in order to accumulate as many viable actions as possible, so long as no opportunities for sending a message are missed.
%Given that a receiving party is composed of dual types, a message that is delayed will still be successfully received.

%Conversely, receiving actions \emph{must} exhibit urgency, as a message existing in a queue indicates that the sender has already progressed to some later type. Consider the trace of a type in~\cref{eq:example_configs_sys_compatability}.
%\begin{minieq}\label{eq:example_configs_sys_compatability}
%   \TypAct1{\TypSend}2{\mathtt{e}}
%   \TypCond1{\Clx<3}2{\Clx}
%   .
%   \TypAct1{\TypRecv}2{\mathtt{f}}
%   \TypCond1{\Clx=0}2{\emptyset}
%   \dots
%\end{minieq}
%In the instance where the sending of \texttt{e} is delayed until the last possible moment $\Clx=2.9$, any delay of its dual counterpart would result in \texttt{f} being send too late. \TODO[note cite?]
%\begin{note}
 %  In this work latency over a network is not considered, but may be accounted for in implementations.

The notion of \emph{well-formedness}, in the context of session types, is a supplement to valid types. It is not enough that a type is syntactically correct, it is also required that they are practically functional and usable.
In the context of timed session types, well-formedness asserts that the constraints of a valid type are also satisfiable given a specific set of clock valuations \ValClocks*.
Hereafter, all types adhere to~\cref{def:types_well_formed} unless otherwise stated.
\input{tex/defs/types/well_formed.tex}

The notion of \emph{duality} refers to a binary setting where each half of a system is an opposes and complements the other. In the context of communicating systems, for every sending action appearing in one type, there must exist a corresponding receiving type in its \emph{dual}. Building on this notion for session types~\cite{Bernardi2014}, and its extension for timed types~\cite{Bocchi2019}, the duality of timeout session types is defined in~\cref{def:types_dual}.
\input{tex/defs/types/duality.tex}
In the binary setting, it is possible to construct a whole system from only one participant, as it is straightforward to derive its co-party.
In other contexts, such as the multiparty setting, the equivalent of \emph{dual types} would be \emph{co-types}; where every sending action has a corresponding reception, but only between the two participants that participate.
