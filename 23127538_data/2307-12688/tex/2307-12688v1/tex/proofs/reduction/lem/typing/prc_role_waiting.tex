% ! (lemma 32) : delay prc and fe recv sesenv role => role is waiting
\begin{lemma}\label{lem:typing_prc_role_waiting}
    %
    If \IPJudgement*>:{\PrcP:\CIso}\ %
    and \PFuncTime*\ is defined 
    and \emph{fail-free} 
    and \Trans*{\CIso}:{\RecvMsg}, 
    then $\PrcP\in\PFuncWait$.
    %
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}
    %
    By the hypothesis it must be that $\Prc=\PCalcRecv$ (where $\PrcAfter=\infty\Implies\Qrc=\PrcFail$). 
    %
    \Prc*\ cannot be anything else as it is typed against \CIso*, which is able to make a transition via \LblCfgIsoInteract* (where $\TypComm=\TypRecv$).
    %
    Additionally, \PFuncTime*\ being defined ensures that \Prc*\ is not a parallel composition of processes.
    Combined with~\cref{fig:prc_func_wait} the hypothesis holds.
    %
\end{proof}
%
\endinput
if a process typed against a configuration that is currently able to receive and able to let time pass, then the role is currently being waited upon.
