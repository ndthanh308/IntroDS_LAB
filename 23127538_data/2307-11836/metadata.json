  "abstract": "We present an estimate of the yield of hard probes expected for collisions of the isobars $^{96}_{44}$Ru and $^{96}_{40}$Zr at collision energies reachable at RHIC and the LHC\\@. These yields are proportional to the number of binary nucleon-nucleon interactions, which is characteristically different due to the presence of the large neutron skin in $^{96}_{40}$Zr. This provides an independent opportunity to measure the difference between the neutron skin of $^{96}_{44}$Ru and $^{96}_{40}$Zr, which can provide an important constraint on the Equation of State of cold neutron-rich matter.",
