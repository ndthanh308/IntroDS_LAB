  "abstract": "We notice an analogy between the motion of a relativistic particle with external homogeneous and time-dependent electromagnetic fields and the Dik'ii-Eilenberger equation for the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation. By means of the integrable defocusing nonlinear Schrödinger hierarchy and their solitons appearing in the Gross-Neveu and Nambu-Jona-Lasinio models, we construct an infinite family of solutions of the Lorentz equation with non-vanishing curvature and torsion.",
