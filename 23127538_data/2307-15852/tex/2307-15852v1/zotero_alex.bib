To make challenging locomotion tasks tractable, we describe several novel applications of convex, mixed-integer, and sparse nonlinear optimization to problems ranging from footstep placement to whole-body planning and control. We also present a state estimator formulation that, when combined with our walking controller, permits highly precise execution of extended walking plans over non-flat terrain. We describe our complete system integration and experiments carried out on Atlas, a full-size hydraulic humanoid robot built by Boston Dynamics, Inc.},

	abstract = {Transfer learning has the potential to reduce the burden of data collection and to decrease the unavoidable risks of the training phase. In this letter, we introduce a multirobot, multitask transfer learning framework that allows a system to complete a task by learning from a few demonstrations of another task executed on another system. We focus on the trajectory tracking problem where each trajectory represents a different task, since many robotic tasks can be described as a trajectory tracking problem. The proposed multirobot transfer learning framework is based on a combined L1 adaptive control and an iterative learning control approach. The key idea is that the adaptive controller forces dynamically different systems to behave as a specified reference model. The proposed multitask transfer learning framework uses theoretical control results (e.g., the concept of vector relative degree) to learn a map from desired trajectories to the inputs that make the system track these trajectories with high accuracy. This map is used to calculate the inputs for a new, unseen trajectory. Experimental results using two different quadrotor platforms and six different trajectories show that, on average, the proposed framework reduces the firstiteration tracking error by 74\% when information from tracking a different single trajectory on a different quadrotor is utilized.},

	abstract = {Multi-robot transfer learning allows a robot to use data generated by a second, similar robot to improve its own behavior. The potential advantages are reducing the time of training and the unavoidable risks that exist during the training phase. Transfer learning algorithms aim to find an optimal transfer map between different robots. In this paper, we investigate, through a theoretical study of single-input single-output (SISO) systems, the properties of such optimal transfer maps. We first show that the optimal transfer learning map is, in general, a dynamic system. The main contribution of the paper is to provide an algorithm for determining the properties of this optimal dynamic map including its order and regressors (i.e., the variables it depends on). The proposed algorithm does not require detailed knowledge of the robots' dynamics, but relies on basic system properties easily obtainable through simple experimental tests. We validate the proposed algorithm experimentally through an example of transfer learning between two different quadrotor platforms. Experimental results show that an optimal dynamic map, with correct properties obtained from our proposed algorithm, achieves 60-70\% reduction of transfer learning error compared to the cases when the data is directly transferred or transferred using an optimal static map.},

	abstract = {Deep reinforcement learning could be used to learn dexterous robotic policies but it is challenging to transfer them to new robots with vastly different hardware properties. It is also prohibitively expensive to learn a new policy from scratch for each robot hardware due to the high sample complexity of modern state-of-the-art algorithms. We propose a novel approach called Hardware Conditioned Policies where we train a universal policy conditioned on a vector representation of robot hardware. We considered robots in simulation with varied dynamics, kinematic structure, kinematic lengths and degrees-of-freedom. First, we use the kinematic structure directly as the hardware encoding and show great zero-shot transfer to completely novel robots not seen during training. For robots with lower zero-shot success rate, we also demonstrate that fine-tuning the policy network is significantly more sample-efficient than training a model from scratch. In tasks where knowing the agent dynamics is important for success, we learn an embedding for robot hardware and show that policies conditioned on the encoding of hardware tend to generalize and transfer well.

	abstract = {In the robotics literature, different knowledge transfer approaches have been proposed to leverage the experience from a source task or robot -- real or virtual -- to accelerate the learning process on a new task or robot. A commonly made but infrequently examined assumption is that incorporating experience from a source task or robot will be beneficial. In practice, inappropriate knowledge transfer can result in negative transfer or unsafe behaviour. In this work, inspired by a system gap metric from robust control theory, the \${\textbackslash}nu\$-gap, we present a data-efficient algorithm for estimating the similarity between pairs of robot systems. In a multi-source inter-robot transfer learning setup, we show that this similarity metric allows us to predict relative transfer performance and thus informatively select experiences from a source robot before knowledge transfer. We demonstrate our approach with quadrotor experiments, where we transfer an inverse dynamics model from a real or virtual source quadrotor to enhance the tracking performance of a target quadrotor on arbitrary hand-drawn trajectories. We show that selecting experiences based on the proposed similarity metric effectively facilitates the learning of the target quadrotor, improving performance by 62\% compared to a poorly selected experience.},

	abstract = {Robot learning has emerged as a promising tool for taming the complexity and diversity of the real world. Methods based on high-capacity models, such as deep networks, hold the promise of providing effective generalization to a wide range of open-world environments. However, these same methods typically require large amounts of diverse training data to generalize effectively. In contrast, most robotic learning experiments are small-scale, single-domain, and single-robot. This leads to a frequent tension in robotic learning: how can we learn generalizable robotic controllers without having to collect impractically large amounts of data for each separate experiment? In this paper, we propose RoboNet, an open database for sharing robotic experience, which provides an initial pool of 15 million video frames, from 7 different robot platforms, and study how it can be used to learn generalizable models for vision-based robotic manipulation. We combine the dataset with two different learning algorithms: visual foresight, which uses forward video prediction models, and supervised inverse models. Our experiments test the learned algorithms' ability to work across new objects, new tasks, new scenes, new camera viewpoints, new grippers, or even entirely new robots. In our final experiment, we find that by pre-training on RoboNet and fine-tuning on data from a held-out Franka or Kuka robot, we can exceed the performance of a robot-specific training approach that uses 4x-20x more data.

We evaluate the approach by training the quadrupedal robot ANYmal to walk on challenging terrain. The parallel approach allows training policies for flat terrain in under four minutes, and in twenty minutes for uneven terrain. This represents a speedup of multiple orders of magnitude compared to previous work. Finally, we transfer the policies to the real robot to validate the approach.

	abstract = {The control algorithm hierarchy of motion control for over-actuated mechanical systems with a redundant set of effectors and actuators commonly includes three levels. First, a high-level motion control algorithm commands a vector of virtual control efforts (i.e. forces and moments) in order to meet the overall motion control objectives. Second, a control allocation algorithm coordinates the different effectors such that they together produce the desired virtual control efforts, if possible. Third, low-level control algorithms may be used to control each individual effector via its actuators. Control allocation offers the advantage of a modular design where the high-level motion control algorithm can be designed without detailed knowledge about the effectors and actuators. Important issues such as input saturation and rate constraints, actuator and effector fault tolerance, and meeting secondary objectives such as power efficiency and tear-and-wear minimization are handled within the control allocation algorithm. The objective of the present paper is to survey control allocation algorithms, motivated by the rapidly growing range of applications that have expanded from the aerospace and maritime industries, where control allocation has its roots, to automotive, mechatronics, and other industries. The survey classifies the different algorithms according to two main classes based on the use of linear or nonlinear models, respectively. The presence of physical constraints (e.g input saturation and rate constraints), operational constraints and secondary objectives makes optimization-based design a powerful approach. The simplest formulations allow explicit solutions to be computed using numerical linear algebra in combination with some logic and engineering solutions, while the more challenging formulations with nonlinear models or complex constraints and objectives call for iterative numerical optimization procedures. Experiences using the different methods in aerospace, maritime, automotive and other application areas are discussed. The paper ends with some perspectives on new applications and theoretical challenges.},

Given measurement variables and parameters, the Buckingham Pi theorem provides a procedure for finding a set of dimensionless groups that spans the solution space, although this set is not unique. We propose an automated approach using the symmetric and self-similar structure of available measurement data to discover the dimensionless groups that best collapse these data to a lower dimensional space according to an optimal fit. We develop three data-driven techniques that use the Buckingham Pi theorem as a constraint: (1) a constrained optimization problem with a non-parametric input–output fitting function, (2) a deep learning algorithm (BuckiNet) that projects the input parameter space to a lower dimension in the first layer and (3) a technique based on sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics to discover dimensionless equations whose coefficients parameterize the dynamics. We explore the accuracy, robustness and computational complexity of these methods and show that they successfully identify dimensionless groups in three example problems: a bead on a rotating hoop, a laminar boundary layer and Rayleigh–Bénard convection.},

In Reinforcement Learning, Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto provide a clear and simple account of the field's key ideas and algorithms. This second edition has been significantly expanded and updated, presenting new topics and updating coverage of other topics.Like the first edition, this second edition focuses on core online learning algorithms, with the more mathematical material set off in shaded boxes. Part I covers as much of reinforcement learning as possible without going beyond the tabular case for which exact solutions can be found. Many algorithms presented in this part are new to the second edition, including UCB, Expected Sarsa, and Double Learning. Part II extends these ideas to function approximation, with new sections on such topics as artificial neural networks and the Fourier basis, and offers expanded treatment of off-policy learning and policy-gradient methods. Part III has new chapters on reinforcement learning's relationships to psychology and neuroscience, as well as an updated case-studies chapter including AlphaGo and AlphaGo Zero, Atari game playing, and IBM Watson's wagering strategy.

Sizing a traditional single-ratio actuation system for such extremum operations leads to oversized heavy electric motor and poor energy efficiency, which hinder the capability of legged systems that bear the mass of their actuators and energy source. This paper explores an actuation concept where a hydrostatic transmission is dynamically reconfigured using valves to suit the requirements of each phase of a robotic leg. An analysis of the mass-delay-flow trade-off for the switching valve is presented. Then, a custom actuation system is built and integrated on a robotic leg test bench to evaluate the concept. Experimental results show that 1) small motorized ball valves can make fast transitions between operating modes when designed for this task, 2) the proposed operating principle and control schemes allow for seamless transitions, even during an impact with the ground and 3) the actuator characteristics address the needs of a leg bimodal operation in terms of force, speed and compliance.},

In particular, ability (as a trustworthiness facet) was a dominant factor affecting trust in HRI. Integrity was found to mediate the relationships between robot- and human-related metrics and trustworthiness.

	abstract = {Moteur de développement scientifique, le concept de vieillissement réussi a su mobiliser les chercheurs dans la construction d'un savoir cumulatif et riche en diversité méthodologique. Cinq décennies de recherche multidisciplinaire ont porté la réflexion gérontologique au-delà de la simple notion de survie, où l'approche quantitative longitudinale, la modélisation par équations structurelles (SEM) et l'argumentation mathématique assument un rôle contemporain grandissant. Traditionnellement absent de la littérature gérontologique, la construction d'un lien analytique formel entre le processus de théorisation et l'analyse quantitative motive le but de cette étude doctorale: Formuler et valider un modèle dynamique de demande de santé physique chez les aînés, dans l'optique plus large de l'élaboration d'un système multidimensionnel d'équations structurelles définissant le vieillissement réussi. Trois objectifs complémentaires sont poursuivis à cette fin: 1) l'élaboration d'un cadre théorique décisionnel, intégrant les principales théories du vieillissement réussi et l'approche microéconomique néo-classique; 2) la dérivation formelle de la demande dynamique de santé physique chez les aînés, fondée sur l'extension mathématique du modèle de Grossman; et 3) l'estimation convergente et non-biaisée des déterminants contemporains de la performance physique des aînés. Ce dernier objectif aborde formellement les phénomènes d'attrition sélective, d'endogénéité statistique et d'hétérogénéité interindividuelle qui accompagnent la recherche quantitative longitudinale sur le vieillissement, où un modèle autorégressif multivarié à erreurs composées est appliqué aux données de l’Étude longitudinale québécoise sur la nutrition comme déterminant d'un vieillissement réussi (NuAge). L'étude secondaire NuAge propose le suivi pluriméthodologique (sociologique, nutritionnel, médical, fonctionnel, anthropométrique) et longitudinal (quatre vagues annuelles successives d'entretiens en face-à-face) de 1793 participants (853 hommes, 940 femmes), âgés entre 67 et 84 ans au moment du recrutement, en bonne santé générale et vivant à domicile dans les régions de Montréal, Laval et de l'Estrie, dans la province de Québec au Canada. Les résultats empiriques les plus saillants exposent la nature dynamique, multidimensionnelle et hautement hétérogène de la composante physiologique du vieillissement réussi. Un haut degré de résilience physique est observé pour l'ensemble des variables dépendantes de force (préhension, biceps, quadriceps) et de mobilité (levers de chaise, vitesse de marche, Timed Up \& Go [TUG]) étudiées, où le contrôle de l'hétérogénéité inobservée fixe (hérédité, personnalité, aptitudes...) réduit significativement l'amplitude de réserve physiologique. Le contrôle des effets fixes tend également à amplifier l'impact négatif de l'âge sur la performance physique des aînés, suggérant à son tour une hétérogénéité interindividuelle favorable au vieillissement réussi. Globalement, les modèles à erreurs composées exposent l'effet positif et contemporain d'une bonne santé mentale sur la performance physique des individus âgés. Les capacités cognitives affectent également la santé physique des aînés, où chaque point additionnel au score 3MS neutralise près de 0,90 année d'effet d'âge sur la force de préhension et sur le temps d'exécution du test TUG. L'analyse empirique permet de plus de dégager certains résultats au niveau des habitudes de vie et de l'autonomie fonctionnelle, exposant l'impact négatif du risque nutritionnel sur la force de préhension, l'impact positif et immédiat de la marche extérieure sur la performance au test TUG, l'impact positif des tâches domestiques lourdes sur la force quadriceps et la performance au test TUG, de même que la causalité positive entre la dépendance fonctionnelle (AVQ) et le temps d'exécution du test TUG.},

On the other hand, the robot behavior should be adapted in its physical movement within the space, in the actions to be selected to achieve collaboration, and by modulating the parameters characterizing the interaction.

	abstract = {A recent trend in human motion capture is the use of inertial measurement units (IMUs) for monitoring and performance evaluation of mobility in the natural living environment. Although the use of such systems have grown significantly, the development of methods and algorithms to process IMU data for clinical purposes is still limited. The aim of this work is to develop algorithms based on wavelet transform and discrete-time detection of events for the automatic segmentation of tasks related activities of daily living (ADL) from body worn IMUs. Seven healthy older adults (73  ±  4 years old) performed 10 ADL tasks in a simulated apartment during trials of different durations (3, 4, and 5 min). They wore a suit (Synertial UK Ltd IGS-180) comprised of 17 IMUs positioned strategically on body segments to capture full body motion. The proposed method automatically detected the number of template waveforms (representing each movement separately) using discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and discrete-time detection of events based on angular velocity, linear acceleration and 3D orientation data of pertinent IMUs. The sensitivity (Se.) and specificity (Sp.) of detection for the proposed method was established using time stamps of10tasks obtained from visual segmentation of each trial using the video records and the avatar provided by the system's software. At first, we identified six pertinent sensors that were strongly associated to different activities (at most two sensors/task) that allowed detection of tasks with high accuracy. The proposed algorithm exhibited significant global accuracy (N events  =  1999, Se.  =  97.5\%, Sp.  =  94\%), despite the variation in the occurrences of the performed tasks (free living). The Se. varied from 94\% to 100\% for all the detected ADL tasks and Sp. ranged from 90\% to 100\% with the worst Sp.  =  85 and 87\% for Release\_mid (reaching for object held just beyond reach at chest height) and Turning\_Left tasks, respectively. This study demonstrated that DWT in conjunction with a nonlinear transform and auto-adaptive thresholding process for decision rules are highly efficient in detecting and segmenting tasks performed during free-living activities. This study also helped to determine the optimal number of sensors, and their location to detect such activities. This work lays the foundation for the automatic assessment of mobility performance within the segmented signals, as well as potentially helps differentiate populations based on their mobility patterns and symptomatology.},

This study investigates, both in controlled and human mobility conditions, a trial calibration technic based on a 2D photograph with a pose estimation algorithm to correct initial difference in AHRS Inertial reference frames and improve joint angle accuracy. In controlled conditions, two AHRS were solidly affixed onto a wooden stick and a series of static and dynamic trials were performed in varying environments. Mean accuracy of relative orientation between the two AHRS was improved from 24.4° to 2.9° using the proposed correction method. In human conditions, AHRS were placed on the shank and the foot of a participant who performed repeated trials of straight walking and walking while turning, varying the level of magnetic perturbation in the starting environment and the walking speed. Mean joint orientation accuracy went from 6.7° to 2.8° using the correction algorithm. The impact of starting environment was also greatly reduced, up to a point where one could consider it as non-significant from a clinical point of view (maximum mean difference went from 8° to 0.6°). The results obtained demonstrate that the proposed method improves significantly the mean accuracy of AHRS joint orientation estimations in magnetically-perturbed environments and can be implemented in post processing of AHRS data collected during biomechanical evaluation of motion.},

	abstract = {In this paper, a novel robotic assistive system (RAS) for mobility assistance of elderly adults is developed based on admittance control with force exertion ability enhancement (FEAE) of a wheeled mobile manipulator (WMM). The RAS can provide supportive force in the vertical direction and be guided by the user with a limited horizontal plane ability. An admittance controller is adopted to realize compliant behaviour between the end-effector and the user, enabling different admittance performances in different directions without requiring the complex system dynamics. The end-effector force needed by the controller is estimated by employing a nonlinear disturbance observer, avoiding the need for pricey force/torque (F/T) sensor. Meanwhile, with consideration of the limited joint torque output, the FEAE approach is implemented in the null-space of the WMM, which can make the system exert more Cartesian force in a given direction with consideration of Cartesian stiffness requirement using the same joint torque limitation through kinematic reconfiguration. Thus, it improves the capability of the system in realizing the desired admittance requirement. The advantages and effectiveness of the proposed approach are experimentally demonstrated with a 4-wheel omnidirectional mobile manipulator.},

	abstract = {Safety and dependability are of the utmost importance for physical human-robot interaction due to the potential risks that a relatively powerful robot poses to human beings. From the control standpoint, it is possible to improve safety by guaranteeing that the robot will never exhibit any unstable behavior. However, stability is not the only concern in the design of a controller for such a robot. During human-robot interaction, the resulting cooperative motion should be truly intuitive and should not restrict in any way the human performance. For this purpose, we have designed a new variable admittance control law that guarantees the stability of the robot during constrained motion and also provides a very intuitive human interaction. The former characteristic is provided by the design of a stability observer while the latter is based on a variable admittance control scheme that uses the time derivative of the contact force to assess human intentions. The stability observer is based on a previously published stability investigation of cooperative motion which implies the knowledge of the interaction stiffness. A method to accurately estimate this stiffness online using the data coming from the encoder and from a multiaxis force sensor at the end effector is also provided. The stability and intuitivity of the control law are verified in a user study involving a cooperative drawing task with a 3 degree-of-freedom (dof) parallel robot as well as in experiments performed with a prototype of an industrial Intelligent Assist Device.},

The experiment was made in two parts, one for each model of Kinect, by comparing raw and merging body tracking data of a two-sided Kinect with the proposed algorithm. The proposed approach improves body tracker data for Kinect 3 which does not have the same characteristics as Kinect 2. This study shows also the importance of defining good heuristics to merge data depending on how the body tracking works. Thus, with proper heuristics, the joint center position estimates are improved by at least 14.6 \%. Finally, we propose an additional comparison between Kinect 2 and Kinect 3 exhibiting the pros and cons of the two sensors.},

During hospitalization older medical patients spend most time lying in bed and numerous barriers toward mobility exist. Therefore, interventions that consider multiple determinants of older patients’ mobility are warranted. The WALK-Cph project aims to increase 24-hour mobility in older medical patients during and after hospitalization. In six medical wards, we performed observations focusing on mobility. In a thematic analysis of data, five themes emerged: materialities, professional roles, encouraging moments, patients’ and relatives’ influence on mobility, and organization’s and management’s influence on mobility. “Professional roles” influenced all themes showing that health professionals follow different cultural models that create contradictions and boundaries and make it unclear who is responsible for the older patients’ mobility. Based on these results, in subsequent workshops with key stakeholders (patients, relatives, researchers and health professionals) we developed an intervention to be tested in a randomized controlled trial.},

This study analysed the 3-D spine forces imposed upon the lumbar spine when 10 subjects manipulated ceiling-based and floor-based patient lifts through various patient handling conditions and manoeuvres. The results indicated that ceiling-mounted patient lift systems imposed spine forces upon the lumbar spine that would be considered safe, whereas floor-based patient handling systems had the potential to increase anterior/posterior shear forces to unacceptable levels during patient handling manoeuvres.

	abstract = {Back injuries are a serious problem for nursing personnel who perform frequent patient-handling activities. Common prevention strategies include body mechanics education, technique training, and ergonomic interventions such as the introduction of assistive equipment. This investigation assessed and compared the effectiveness of two patient-handling approaches to reducing injury risk. One strategy involved using improved patient-handling technique with existing equipment, and the other approach aimed at eliminating manual patient handling through the use of additional mechanical and other assistive equipment. Both intervention arms received training in back care, patient assessment, and use of the equipment available on their particular wards. An analysis of compliance with interventions and the effects of patient-handling methods on both peak and cumulative spinal compression and shear during various tasks was conducted. Results showed greater compliance with interventions that incorporated new assistive patient-handling equipment, as opposed to those consisting of education and technique training alone. In several tasks, subjects who were untrained or non-compliant with interventions experienced significantly higher peak spinal loading. However, patient-handling tasks conducted with the aid of assistive equipment took substantially longer than those performed manually. This, along with variations in techniques, led to increases in cumulative spinal loading with the use of patient-handling equipment on some tasks. Thus, the use of mechanical assistive devices may not always be the best approach to reducing back injuries in all situations. No single intervention can be recommended; instead all patient-handling tasks should be examined separately to determine which methods maximize reductions in both peak and cumulative lumbar forces during a manoeuver.},

Although there have been a plethora of studies on MSDs, an overall understanding of the prevalence of MSDs and pain can lead to better prioritization of research needs with respect to the health care industry.MethodA total of 132 articles on prevalence of MSD pain and injuries were included in the review. All articles were published in peer-reviewed English-speaking journals and subjected to a quality review.ResultsReported prevalence of MSD pain for nurses and nursing aides was highest in the low back, followed by shoulders and neck. However, the majority of the studies have been concentrated on 12-month pain in the low back and predominantly in hospitals. Few researchers have investigated pain in the upper and lower extremities (less than 27\% of the studies). Even fewer researchers have evaluated reported injuries or even subjective lost-time injuries (less than 15\% of the studies).ConclusionMSD pain in the nursing profession has been widely investigated worldwide, with a major focus on low-back pain. Given new directions in health care, such as patients who live longer with more chronic diseases, bariatric patients, early mobility requirements, and those who want to be at home during sickness, higher prevalence levels may shift to different populations?home health care workers, long-term care workers, and physical therapists?as well as shift to different body regions, such as shoulders and upper extremities.},

To improve upon the conventional TDM designs, this paper presents a TDM actuated by magnetorheological (MR) clutches. The MR-TDM concept combines the advantages of lightweight electric geared motors with the high dynamic performance of MR clutches. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the overall performance of the MR-TDM and demonstrate its wide range of applications. Analytical studies show the higher open-loop natural frequency (60 Hz) and lower reflected output inertia of the MR-TDM compared to the TDM powered by traditional actuators. Furthermore, experiments with a 2-DOF MR-TDM prototype demonstrate the usefulness of the approach for a wide variety of tasks ranging from a soft and precise control to a high impulse response and fast trajectory tracking.},

	abstract = {Background Inertial measurement of motion with Attitude and Heading Reference Systems (AHRS) is emerging as an alternative to 3D motion capture systems in biomechanics. The objectives of this study are: 1) to describe the absolute and relative accuracy of multiple units of commercially available AHRS under various types of motion; and 2) to evaluate the effect of motion velocity on the accuracy of these measurements. Methods The criterion validity of accuracy was established under controlled conditions using an instrumented Gimbal table. AHRS modules were carefully attached to the center plate of the Gimbal table and put through experimental static and dynamic conditions. Static and absolute accuracy was assessed by comparing the AHRS orientation measurement to those obtained using an optical gold standard. Relative accuracy was assessed by measuring the variation in relative orientation between modules during trials. Findings Evaluated AHRS systems demonstrated good absolute static accuracy (mean error {\textless} 0.5o) and clinically acceptable absolute accuracy under condition of slow motions (mean error between 0.5o and 3.1o). In slow motions, relative accuracy varied from 2o to 7o depending on the type of AHRS and the type of rotation. Absolute and relative accuracy were significantly affected (p{\textless}0.05) by velocity during sustained motions. The extent of that effect varied across AHRS. Interpretation Absolute and relative accuracy of AHRS are affected by environmental magnetic perturbations and conditions of motions. Relative accuracy of AHRS is mostly affected by the ability of all modules to locate the same global reference coordinate system at all time. Conclusions Existing AHRS systems can be considered for use in clinical biomechanics under constrained conditions of use. While their individual capacity to track absolute motion is relatively consistent, the use of multiple AHRS modules to compute relative motion between rigid bodies needs to be optimized according to the conditions of operation.},

Our method combines a new convolutional neural network (CNN) based pose regressor with kinematic skeleton fitting. Our novel fully-convolutional pose formulation regresses 2D and 3D joint positions jointly in real time and does not require tightly cropped input frames. A real-time kinematic skeleton fitting method uses the CNN output to yield temporally stable 3D global pose reconstructions on the basis of a coherent kinematic skeleton. This makes our approach the first monocular RGB method usable in real-time applications such as 3D character control---thus far, the only monocular methods for such applications employed specialized RGB-D cameras. Our method's accuracy is quantitatively on par with the best offline 3D monocular RGB pose estimation methods. Our results are qualitatively comparable to, and sometimes better than, results from monocular RGB-D approaches, such as the Kinect. However, we show that our approach is more broadly applicable than RGB-D solutions, i.e., it works for outdoor scenes, community videos, and low quality commodity RGB cameras.},

The pose estimation problem becomes more feasible when using streams of 2.5D monocular depth images as provided by a depth camera. However, due to low resolution of and challenging noise characteristics in depth camera images as well as self-occlusions in the movements, the pose estimation task is still far from being simple. Furthermore, in real-time scenarios, the reconstruction task becomes even more challenging since global optimization strategies are prohibitive. To facilitate tracking of full-body human motions from a single depth-image stream, we introduce a data-driven hybrid strategy that combines local pose optimization with global retrieval techniques. Here, the final pose estimate at each frame is determined from the tracked and retrieved pose hypotheses which are fused using a fast selection scheme. Our algorithm reconstructs complex full-body poses in real time and effectively prevents temporal drifting, thus making it suitable for various real-time interaction scenarios.},

With LiDAR sensors becoming more affordable and common on robots and autonomous vehicle setups, we propose an end-to-end architecture using RGB and LiDAR to predict the absolute 3D human pose with unprecedented precision.

This paper studies the feasibility of using magnetorheological (MR) clutches coupled-to a low-friction hydrostatic transmission to provide a highly capable, but yet lightweight, force-controllable SRL. A 2.7 kg 2-DOFs wearable robotic arm is designed and built. Shoulder and elbow joints are designed to deliver 39 and 25 Nm, with 115 and 180° of range of motion. Experimental studies conducted on a one-DOF test bench and validated analytically demonstrate a high force bandwidth ({\textgreater}25 Hz) and a good ability to control interaction forces even when interacting with an external impedance. Furthermore, three force-control approaches are studied and demonstrated experimentally: open-loop, closed-loop on force, and closed-loop on pressure. All three methods are shown to be effective. Overall, the proposed MR-Hydrostatic actuation system is well-suited for a lightweight SRL interacting with both human and environment that add unpredictable disturbances.},

Simulations show that the MR leg's low actuation inertia reduces the impact impulse by a factor 4 compared to geared motors and that delocalizing the clutches reduces by half the inertial forces transmitted to the user during swing. An impedance controller receives a reference trajectory based on each ankle's position to move the MR leg in synchrony with the gait cycle. Experiments show that the MR leg can comfortably contact the ground and swing at 3.9 m/s for a 1.4 m/s walk. The MR leg tracks the ankle within 5\% of the gait cycle for the leader-follower gait, alternately tracks both ankles for the double gait and contacts the ground in between each step for the three-legged gait. A theoretical upper limit suggests that the average transmitted power in a gait cycle could be 84 W for the leader-follower gait, which is 4 times higher than autonomous ankle exoskeletons.},

	abstract = {Supernumerary robotic limbs (SRL) are wearable extra limbs intended to help humans perform physical tasks beyond conventional capabilities in domestic and industrial applications. However, unique design challenges are associated with SRLs as they are mounted on the human body. SRLs must!) be lightweight to avoid burdening the user, 2) be fast enough to compensate for human unpredictable motions, 3) be strong enough to accomplish a multitude of tasks, 4) have high force-bandwidth and good backdrivability to control interaction forces between the user and the environment. This letter studies the potential of a remotely actuated 3-DOF supernumerary robotic arm equipped with a 3 fingers soft gripper, both powered by magnetorheological (MR) clutches and hydrostatic transmission lines. The tethered configuration allows the power-unit to be located on the ground, which minimizes theremote mass (4.2 kg) on the user. MR clutches minimize the actuation inertia in order to provide fast dynamics and good backdrivability. An experimental open-loop force-bandwidth of !8 Hz is obtained at each joint and the maximal speed reached by the device end-effector is 3.4 m/s, which is sufficient for compensating human motions. In addition, the two first joints provide 35 Nm and the third joint provides 29 Nm, which is strong enough to hold manual industrial tools. Finally, the SRL is put in real practical situations, as fruit and vegetables picking, painting, tools holding and badminton playing. The capability of the proposed MR-Hydrostatic SRL to perform successfully various tasks with high speed and smoothness suggests a strong potential of SRLs to become future commonly used devices.},

However, most lower-limb exoskeletons use highly geared, nonback-drivable actuators with limited power and force bandwidth in order to be light enough to be carried without metabolic penalty. Moreover, they rely on controllers that depend on past motion history to assist the user, which limits the multifunctional capabilities of exoskeletons. Here, we study the potential of delocalized magnetorheological (MR) clutches to provide transparent but yet powerful multifunctional exoskeleton assistance. A single high-speed, lightweight motor is coupled with two MR clutches that modulate the plantar-flexion torque at each ankle. The exoskeleton is controlled by a state map controller that can assist users in real time while walking, jumping, and landing. Results confirm the potential of the MR actuation approach by demonstrating instantaneous adaptation to transient walking and by producing a maximal torque of 90 N·m per ankle with a total power of 1.4 kW when jumping. The system also actively braked landing impact and achieved multifunctional assistance in a sequence of walking, jumping, and landing. With a total mass of 6.2 kg including 0.9 kg on each leg, the system reduces metabolic cost of walking by 5.6\% on average with tethered electronics and power supply.},

	abstract = {Precise and high-fidelity force control is critical for new generations of robots that interact with humans and unknown environments. Mobile robots, such as wearable devices and legged robots, must also be lightweight to accomplish their function. Hydrostatic transmissions have been proposed as a promising strategy for meeting these two challenging requirements. In previous publications, it was shown that using magnetorheological (MR) actuators coupled with hydrostatic transmissions provides high power density and great open-loop human-robot interactions. Still, the open-loop force fidelity at low and high frequencies are decreased by the transmission's dynamics and by nonlinear friction. This paper compares control strategies for MR-hydrostatic actuator systems to increase its torque fidelity, defined as the bandwidth (measured vs desired torque reference) and transparency (minimizing the undesired forces reflected to the end effector when backdriving the robot). Four control approaches are developed and compared experimentally: (1) Open-loop control with friction compensation; (2) non-collocated pressure feedback;(3) collocated pressure feedback; (4) LQGI state feedback. A dither strategy is also implemented to smoothen ball screw friction. Results show that approaches (1), (2) and (3) can increase the performances but are facing compromises, while approach (4) can simultaneously improve all metrics. These results show the potential of using control schemes for improving the force control performance of robots using tethered architectures, addressing issues such as transmission dynamics and friction.},

The rotational torque and drawbar pull at the tire center and the traction and motion resistance on the contact patch are studied with slips and normal load as inputs. The relationships between all these interfacial forces and the inputs (longitudinal slip, slip angle and vertical wheel load) are presented.

For energy management, the vehicle longitudinal dynamics used to estimate vehicle power demands depend on several parameters, including its mass and its rolling conditions. This study compared the methods of estimating the rolling resistance coefficient and mass to establish energy planning system of an electric vehicle in winter conditions. Different from reported approaches, which are limited to estimate only one parameter, the vehicle mass or the rolling resistance, this paper used two efficient methods which, simultaneously estimate vehicle mass and rolling resistance coefficient. The first method is based on RLS algorithm, while the second is based on neural network. The estimated values of rolling resistance coefficient retrieved from these methods are similar to those provided by a third method, which estimates only the rolling resistance by considering the mass as input and using RLS algorithm. Although results retrieved from the three methods show that the estimated values converge to real values with a margin error that does not exceed 10\%, we suggest that the first and the third method, using the RLS algorithm and giving an online estimation, are more accurate and more suitable in snow covered road conditions.},

This paper describes a distraction-based lane-keeping support system, which intervenes only when the driver is positively detected as being distracted. Distraction here is understood as cognitive and visual distraction, and the focus of this system is on the latter one. In order to estimate the driver's visual distraction level, a video-based driver monitoring system is used. Lane-keeping support is provided by an additional torque applied on the steering shaft in order to regain an appropriate lane position. In this manner the system only intervenes when the vehicle has drifted out of its lane and while the driver is distracted. Test track investigations indicate large opportunities for such a system from a driver perspective, provided that sufficient reliability of the employed vision sensor for lane and face tracking can be obtained.},

	abstract = {In this paper, integration of steering and braking are studied for collision avoidance from the standpoint of optimal control theory. First, the collision avoidance by braking, steering, and steering with braking maneuvers are theoretically investigated. By some assumptions, such as, the point mass vehicle model and constant resultant vehicle force in all directions, the selection of the best maneuver for collision avoidance is represented by the regions on a 2-D diagram. The nondimensionalized axes of this diagram stand for all required vehicle state and geometrical conditions, more specifically, the remaining distance, longitudinal vehicle velocity, lane width, and friction coefficient. Second, a two-point boundary value problem derived for the integrated control is reduced to a single equation with an unknown via algebraic simplifications, and the bisection method turns out to be the most appropriate among the algorithms that have been tested. It turned out that the efficient and precise solution of the optimal control problem is guaranteed, including the cases in which the intervention has been initiated. Consequently, this paper realizes the efficient identification of the theoretically reliable reference maneuver of single lane change with the minimum collision avoidance distance in the framework of feedback control.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the design, tuning, and evaluation of a full-range adaptive cruise control (ACC) system with collision avoidance (CA). The control scheme is designed to improve drivers’ comfort during normal, safe-driving situations and to completely avoid rear-end collision in vehicle-following situations. Driving situations are divided into safe, warning, and dangerous modes. Three different control strategies have been proposed, depending on the driving situation. The driving situations are determined using a non-dimensional warning index and the time-to-collision (TTC). The control parameters of the proposed ACC/CA system are tuned by a confusion-matrix method using manual-driving data in no-crashing driving situations. The vehicle-following characteristics of the subject vehicle were compared to real-world, manual-driving data. Finally, the ACC/CA system was also implemented in a real vehicle and tested in both safe-traffic and severe-braking situations. It is shown that the proposed control strategy can provide natural following performance that is similar to human manual-driving in both high-speed driving and low-speed stop-and-go situations. Furthermore, it can prevent the vehicle-to-vehicle distance from dropping to an unsafe level in a variety of driving conditions.},

Different drivers vary in how they hit the gas and brake pedals, how they turn the steering wheel, and how much following distance they keep to follow a vehicle safely and comfortably. In this paper, we model such driving behaviors as car-following and pedal operation patterns. The relationship between following distance and velocity mapped into a two-dimensional space is modeled for each driver with an optimal velocity model approximated by a nonlinear function or with a statistical method of a Gaussian mixture model (GMM). Pedal operation patterns are also modeled with GMMs that represent the distributions of raw pedal operation signals or spectral features extracted through spectral analysis of the raw pedal operation signals. The driver models are evaluated in driver identification experiments using driving signals collected in a driving simulator and in a real vehicle. Experimental results show that the driver model based on the spectral features of pedal operation signals efficiently models driver individual differences and achieves an identification rate of 76.8\% for a field test with 276 drivers, resulting in a relative error reduction of 55\% over driver models that use raw pedal operation signals without spectral analysis},

K-fold cross-validation as well as out-of-bag error was used for model selection and validation purposes. Several features were created from which a subset was identified through the minimum redundancy maximum relevance method. Data obtained from the smartphone sensors were found to provide important information to distinguish between transportation modes. The performance of different methods was evaluated and compared.

In this paper, we establish a 14-DOF dynamic model of an autonomous vehicle and use RL to build a decision-making system for autonomous driving based on simulation. The decision-making process of the vehicle is modeled as an MDP, and the performance of the MDP is improved using an approximate RL.

However, the problem faced is extremely challenging as only in-vehicle driving data must be used, whereas the number of driving events is usually quite large. In this paper, we propose a learning-based driving events classification method, which is trained and tested with a real driving events database. The proposed method includes definition of driving events relevant to our final application, selection of discriminating features, and classification, using two machine-learning techniques, namely, decision trees and linear logistic regression. We then introduce the digital road concept. This consists of simulated road data used in the truck design process to quantify the behavior of a truck, particularly in terms of fuel consumption. While a digital road typically contains far less driving information, we show that we can still apply the proposed driving events recognition models learnt on real driving data and pave the way for a more realistic assessment of truck characteristics via simulation tools.},

	abstract = {This paper discusses how the driving context (driving events and distraction level) can be determined using a mobile phone equipped with several sensors. The majority of existing in-car communication systems (ICCS) available today are built-in and do not use the driving context. This creates two issues: firstly, the use of an ICCS is limited to specific cars and secondly, the driver's safety remains an issue, as the driving context is not taken into account. This paper discusses two experiments in which data are collected, trained and tested in order to create a model that predicts driving events and distraction level. A mobile, context-aware application was built using the MIMIC (Multimodal Interface for Mobile Info-communication with Context) Framework. The Inference Engine uses information from several sources, namely mobile sensors, GPS and weather information, to infer both the driving event and the distraction level. The results obtained showed that the driving events and the distraction level can be accurately predicted. The driving events were predicted using the IB1 technique with an accuracy of 92.25\%. In the second experiment, the distraction level was predicted with 95.16\% accuracy, using the KStar (decision tree) technique. An analysis of the decision tree showed that some variables were more important than others in predicting the driving context. These variables included the speed and direction, as well as acceleration, magnetic field and orientation.},

	abstract = {Flying robots require a combination of accuracy and low latency in their state estimation in order to achieve stable and robust flight. However, due to the power and payload constraints of aerial platforms, state estimation algorithms must provide these qualities under the computational constraints of embedded hardware. Cameras and inertial measurement units (IMUs) satisfy these power and payload constraints, so visual-inertial odometry (VIO) algorithms are popular choices for state estimation in these scenarios, in addition to their ability to operate without external localization from motion capture or global positioning systems. It is not clear from existing results in the literature, however, which VIO algorithms perform well under the accuracy, latency, and computational constraints of a flying robot with onboard state estimation. This paper evaluates an array of publicly-available VIO pipelines (MSCKF, OKVIS, ROVIO, VINS-Mono, SVO+MSF, and SVO+GTSAM) on different hardware configurations, including several single-board computer systems that are typically found on flying robots. The evaluation considers the pose estimation accuracy, per-frame processing time, and CPU and memory load while processing the EuRoC datasets, which contain six degree of freedom (6DoF) trajectories typical of flying robots. We present our complete results as a benchmark for the research community.},

	abstract = {Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRLs) are wearable robots augmenting human capabilities by acting as a co-worker, reaching objects, support human arms, etc. However, existing SRLs lack the mechanical backdrivability and bandwidth required for tasks where the interaction forces must be controlled such as painting, drilling, manipulating fragile objects, etc. Being highly backdrivable with a high bandwidth while minimizing weight presents a major technological challenge imposed by the limited performances of conventional electromagnetic actuators. This paper studies the feasibility of using magnetorheological (MR) clutches coupled-to a low-friction hydrostatic transmission to provide a highly capable, but yet lightweight, force-controllable SRL. A 2.7 kg 2-DOFs wearable robotic arm is designed and built. Shoulder and elbow joints are designed to deliver 39 and 25 Nm, with 115 and 180° of range of motion. Experimental studies conducted on a one-DOF test bench and validated analytically demonstrate a high force bandwidth ({\textgreater}25 Hz) and a good ability to control interaction forces even when interacting with an external impedance. Furthermore, three force-control approaches are studied and demonstrated experimentally: open-loop, closed-loop on force, and closed-loop on pressure. All three methods are shown to be effective. Overall, the proposed MR-Hydrostatic actuation system is well-suited for a lightweight SRL interacting with both human and environment that add unpredictable disturbances.},

However, most lower-limb exoskeletons use highly geared, nonback-drivable actuators with limited power and force bandwidth in order to be light enough to be carried without metabolic penalty. Moreover, they rely on controllers that depend on past motion history to assist the user, which limits the multifunctional capabilities of exoskeletons. Here, we study the potential of delocalized magnetorheological (MR) clutches to provide transparent but yet powerful multifunctional exoskeleton assistance. A single high-speed, lightweight motor is coupled with two MR clutches that modulate the plantar-flexion torque at each ankle. The exoskeleton is controlled by a state map controller that can assist users in real time while walking, jumping, and landing. Results confirm the potential of the MR actuation approach by demonstrating instantaneous adaptation to transient walking and by producing a maximal torque of 90 N·m per ankle with a total power of 1.4 kW when jumping. The system also actively braked landing impact and achieved multifunctional assistance in a sequence of walking, jumping, and landing. With a total mass of 6.2 kg including 0.9 kg on each leg, the system reduces metabolic cost of walking by 5.6\% on average with tethered electronics and power supply.},

	abstract = {Lower-limb exoskeletons have shown increasing potential to augment human performance in many locomotion tasks. However, most lower-limb exoskeletons use highly geared, nonback-drivable actuators with limited power and force bandwidth in order to be light enough to be carried without metabolic penalty. Moreover, they rely on controllers that depend on past motion history to assist the user, which limits the multifunctional capabilities of exoskeletons. Here, we study the potential of delocalized magnetorheological (MR) clutches to provide transparent but yet powerful multifunctional exoskeleton assistance. A single high-speed, lightweight motor is coupled with two MR clutches that modulate the plantar-flexion torque at each ankle. The exoskeleton is controlled by a state map controller that can assist users in real time while walking, jumping, and landing. Results confirm the potential of the MR actuation approach by demonstrating instantaneous adaptation to transient walking and by producing a maximal torque of 90 N·m per ankle with a total power of 1.4 kW when jumping. The system also actively braked landing impact and achieved multifunctional assistance in a sequence of walking, jumping, and landing. With a total mass of 6.2 kg including 0.9 kg on each leg, the system reduces metabolic cost of walking by 5.6\% on average with tethered electronics and power supply.},

	abstract = {Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRLs) are wearable robots augmenting human capabilities by acting as a co-worker, reaching objects, support human arms, etc. However, existing SRLs lack the mechanical backdrivability and bandwidth required for tasks where the interaction forces must be controlled such as painting, drilling, manipulating fragile objects, etc. Being highly backdrivable with a high bandwidth while minimizing weight presents a major technological challenge imposed by the limited performances of conventional electromagnetic actuators. This paper studies the feasibility of using magnetorheological (MR) clutches coupled-to a low-friction hydrostatic transmission to provide a highly capable, but yet lightweight, force-controllable SRL. A 2.7 kg 2-DOFs wearable robotic arm is designed and built. Shoulder and elbow joints are designed to deliver 39 and 25 Nm, with 115 and 180° of range of motion. Experimental studies conducted on a one-DOF test bench and validated analytically demonstrate a high force bandwidth ({\textgreater}25 Hz) and a good ability to control interaction forces even when interacting with an external impedance. Furthermore, three force-control approaches are studied and demonstrated experimentally: open-loop, closed-loop on force, and closed-loop on pressure. All three methods are shown to be effective. Overall, the proposed MR-Hydrostatic actuation system is well-suited for a lightweight SRL interacting with both human and environment that add unpredictable disturbances.},

	abstract = {Visual inertial odometry (VIO) is a technique to estimate the change of a mobile platform in position and orientation overtime using the measurements from on-board cameras and IMU sensor. Recently, VIO attracts significant attentions from large number of researchers and is gaining the popularity in various potential applications due to the miniaturisation in size and low cost in price of two sensing modularities. However, it is very challenging in both of technical development and engineering implementation when accuracy, real-time performance, robustness and operation scale are taken into consideration. This survey is to report the state of the art VIO techniques from the perspectives of filtering and optimisation-based approaches, which are two dominated approaches adopted in the research area. To do so, various representations of 3D rigid motion body are illustrated. Then filtering-based approaches are reviewed, and followed by optimisation-based approaches. The links between these two approaches will be clarified via a framework of the Bayesian Maximum A Posterior. Other features, such as observability and self calibration, will be discussed.},

	abstract = {To study body ownership and control, illusions that elicit these feelings in non-body objects are widely used. Classically introduced with the Rubber Hand Illusion, these illusions have been replicated more recently in virtual reality and by using brain-computer interfaces. Traditionally these illusions investigate the replacement of a body part by an artificial counterpart, however as brain-computer interface research develops it offers us the possibility to explore the case where non-body objects are controlled in addition to movements of our own limbs. Therefore we propose a new illusion designed to test the feeling of ownership and control of an independent supernumerary hand. Subjects are under the impression they control a virtual reality hand via a brain-computer interface, but in reality there is no causal connection between brain activity and virtual hand movement but correct movements are observed with 80\% probability. These imitation brain-computer interface trials are interspersed with movements in both the subjects’ real hands, which are in view throughout the experiment. We show that subjects develop strong feelings of ownership and control over the third hand, despite only receiving visual feedback with no causal link to the actual brain signals. Our illusion is crucially different from previously reported studies as we demonstrate independent ownership and control of the third hand without loss of ownership in the real hands.},

	abstract = {We present a new type of hydrostatic transmission that uses a hybrid air-water configuration, analogous to N+1 cable-tendon transmissions, using N hydraulic lines and 1 pneumatic line for a system with N degrees of freedom (DOFs). The common air-filled line preloads all DOFs in the system, allowing bidirectional operation of every joint. This configuration achieves the high stiffness of a water-filled transmission with half the number of bulky hydraulic lines. We implemented this transmission using pairs of rolling-diaphragm cylinders to form rotary hydraulic actuators, with a new design achieving a 600-percent increase in specific work density per cycle. These actuators were used to build a humanoid robot with two 4-DOF arms, connected via the hydrostatic transmission to an identical master. Stereo cameras mounted on a 2-DOF servo-controlled neck stream live video to the operator's head-mounted display, which in turn sends the real-time attitude of the operator's head to the neck servos in the robot. The operator is visually immersed in the robot's physical workspace, and through the bilateral coupling of the low-impedance hydrostatic transmission, directly feels interaction forces between the robot and external environment. We qualitatively assessed the performance of this system for remote object manipulation and use as a platform to safely study physical human-robot interaction.},

The results are then compared to the consumption of an equivalent non-redundant stiff actuator. The results highlight the capability of the actuator to reduce energy consumption in comparison with the latter actuator.},

	abstract = {In many applications, robots have to bear large loads while moving slowly and also have to move quickly through the air with almost no load. These type of bi-modal tasks, with conflicting requirements in terms of operating speeds and desired impedances, often lead to the use of oversized and inefficient actuators which are inhibitory particularly for mobile robots. Multiple gear ratios, like in a powertrain, address this issue by allowing an effective use of power over a wide range of output speeds, by enabling significant changes to the reflected intrinsic actuator impedances and by making possible the leveraging or attenuation of the natural load dynamics. This thesis aims to develop the technological solutions needed to use variable gear ratio actuators and exploit the advantages of variable transmissions in a robotic context. First, by addressing the issue of how to make fast and seamless gearshifts between two very different reduction ratios under diverse load conditions, with a solution based on a dual-motor actuator architecture and a control scheme using the null space. Second, by developing control algorithms that select optimal gear ratios dynamically based on state feedback, to move with minimal motor torques and to adjust the output impedance appropriately given a task. The proposed approach exploit variable transmissions not merely for increasing maximum torque and speed, but also to significantly alter the dynamic properties, including load sensitivity, robustness, and backdrivability. Simulations and experiments using a novel lightweight robotic arm using three custom-built dual-speed dual-motor actuators are presented. Results demonstrate very fast gear shifting in highly dynamic situations with dual-speed dual-motor actuators, and show that actively changing gear ratios using the proposed control algorithms can lead to an order-of-magnitude reduction of necessary motor torque and power.},

A CVT is a transmission whose ratio can be continuously varied and an IVT is a transmission whose ratio can be continuously varied from positive to negative values. However, efficient use of such transmissions in walking applications requires changing the transmission ratio at a minimal energy cost, even at rest, i.e. when the input shaft is not rotating. This contribution proposes a novel CVT and IVT principle which can achieve such ratio variations at rest. The presented CVT is a modified planetary gear, whose planets are conical and mounted on inclined shafts, and whose ring is made of contiguous diabolo-shaped rollers. This configuration enables the control of the transmission ratio by adjusting the point of contact between the cones and rollers that comprise the ring. A traditional planetary gear system can be added to the CVT to form an IVT.},

First, we derive an accurate semi-empirical model of this system and prove its validity on a test setup. Based on this model, which includes nonlinear friction terms, we analyze how the power flows and energy losses depend on the redundant degree of freedom. Furthermore, we discuss how the design of the actuator can be optimized for energy efficiency. This strategy is applied to a case study, where a 250 W geared DC motor is replaced by a more efficient dual-motor actuator. Experiments confirm that a dual-motor actuator succeeds in reducing the energy consumption at various loads and speeds. We also show that the results are very sensitive to friction and other speed- and load-dependent losses.},

In this paper, a new closed-loop, field-programable-gate-array (FPGA)-based control scheme to linearize an MR clutch's input-output relationship is presented. The feedback signal used in this control scheme is the magnetic field acquired from hall sensors within the MR clutch. The FPGA board uses this feedback signal to compensate for the nonlinear behavior of the MR clutch using an estimated model of the clutch magnetic field. The local use of an FPGA board will dramatically simplify the use of MR clutches for torque actuation. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated using an experimental platform that includes an MR clutch as part of a compliant actuation mechanism.

	abstract = {Background
Many soldiers are expected to carry heavy loads over extended distances, often resulting in physical and mental fatigue. In this study, the design and testing of an autonomous leg exoskeleton is presented. The aim of the device is to reduce the energetic cost of loaded walking. In addition, we present the Augmentation Factor, a general framework of exoskeletal performance that unifies our results with the varying abilities of previously developed exoskeletons.

Methods
We developed an autonomous battery powered exoskeleton that is capable of providing substantial levels of positive mechanical power to the ankle during the push-off region of stance phase. We measured the metabolic energy consumption of seven subjects walking on a level treadmill at 1.5 m/s, while wearing a 23 kg vest.

Results
During the push-off portion of the stance phase, the exoskeleton applied positive mechanical power with an average across the gait cycle equal to 23 ± 2 W (11.5 W per ankle). Use of the autonomous leg exoskeleton significantly reduced the metabolic cost of walking by 36 ± 12 W, which was an improvement of 8 ± 3\% (p = 0.025) relative to the control condition of not wearing the exoskeleton.

Conclusions
In the design of leg exoskeletons, the results of this study highlight the importance of minimizing exoskeletal power dissipation and added limb mass, while providing substantial positive power during the walking gait cycle.},

From scampering through life-size mazes to cracking codes, we revel in the simplicity and difficulty of these tasks. As contestants totter precariously, we find ourselves wondering about the difficulty of their challenge: standing on one foot with arms outstretched for as long as possible.  10 seconds.  30 seconds.  1 minute.  …collapsing one after another until the winner remains standing.  For something as seemingly easy as holding your arms outstretched, imagine how much more difficult it would be if in your hands were a 30-pound sandblaster. Thirty pounds doesn’t sound like much, but consider that it is roughly the weight of an average toddler, four one-gallon jugs of milk or six laptops. Odds are you wouldn’t be able to hold the weight for long before needing to rest.  This is a common scenario in the industrial sector where workers must use heavy, hand-operated tools to complete their tasks. Whether grinding barnacles off a ship’s hull or welding a long section of beam, daily industrial work can be physically exhausting. That’s where exoskeleton technology comes in.  “Exoskeletons can enhance a person’s physical capabilities,” said Patricia Aelker, program manager of Lockheed Martin’s exoskeleton technologies. “To increase strength or endurance, you must have a keen understanding about the structure of the human body, the science of how the body moves and the variations among individuals.”  Using that information, as well as lessons from previous proof-of-concept designs, the team developed the FORTIS™ exoskeleton, which comfortably accommodates multiple body types while increasing endurance and productivity. FORTIS™ exoskeleton Understanding the differences of individual bodies, the FORTIS team designed the exoskeleton to be adjustable to fit a range of body sizes and types.  The FORTIS exoskeleton takes the weight of a load, like a heavy hand tool, off operators, making it easier for them to do their work. Using the principles of biomechanics, the weight is transferred to a mechanical arm and down to the ground through a series of joints, similar to the joints in your hips, knees and ankles.},

	abstract = {An additional mechanical mechanism for a passive parallelogram-based exoskeleton arm-support is presented. It consists of several levers and joints and an attached extension coil spring. The additional mechanism has two favourable features. On the one hand it exhibits an almost iso-elastic behaviour whereby the lifting force of the mechanism is constant for a wide working range. Secondly, the value of the supporting force can be varied by a simple linear movement of a supporting joint. Furthermore a standard tension spring can be used to gain the desired behavior. The additional mechanism is a 4-link mechanism affixed to one end of the spring within the parallelogram arm-support. It has several geometrical parameters which influence the overall behaviour. A standard optimisation routine with constraints on the parameters is used to find an optimal set of geometrical parameters. Based on the optimized geometrical parameters a prototype was constructed and tested. It is a lightweight wearable system, with a weight of 1.9 kg. Detailed experiments reveal a difference between measured and calculated forces. These variations can be explained by a 60 \% higher pre load force of the tension spring and a geometrical offset in the construction.},

	abstract = {Humans possess the remarkable ability to control their four natural limbs in a voluntary, accurate and independent manner. The simultaneous use of two or more limbs allows humans to learn and robustly perform a wide range of complex tasks. Since the use of multiple limbs enables humans to master advanced motor skills, it would be interesting to study whether having additional limbs would enable users to expand their skill set beyond its natural limits. Inspired by this vision, we propose a new form of human augmentation: a wearable robot that augments its user by providing him with an additional set of robotic limbs. We named this new device Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL). However, humans have never had the possibility to control additional, powered limbs besides their natural arms and legs. The main theme of this thesis, besides realizing a prototype of the robot and proving its usefulness in realworld tasks, is demonstrating that humans can voluntarily control additional limbs as if they were a part of their own body. We realized a lightweight (3.5 kg), comfortable prototype of the SRL that can be easily worn by an unassisted user. Two robotic limbs can assist the user in both manufacturing and locomotion tasks. We created control strategies that take advantage of the independence of the robotic limbs, enabling them to provide optimal assistance in specific tasks such as weight support, body stabilization, using powered tools, sitting/standing and dynamic walking. Finally, we developed an EMG-based control interface that enables users to voluntarily control the motion of the robotic limbs, without interfering with the posture of the rest of the body. The new augmentation technology presented in this thesis opens up new possibilities in the field of wearable robotics. The voluntary control of additional robotic limbs falls within the range of motor skills that humans can learn, and enables the acquisition of a new set of complex skills that would not be achievable using only the natural body..},

This paper explores domain randomization, a simple technique for training models on simulated images that transfer to real images by randomizing rendering in the simulator. With enough variability in the simulator, the real world may appear to the model as just another variation. We focus on the task of object localization, which is a stepping stone to general robotic manipulation skills. We find that it is possible to train a real-world object detector that is accurate to \$1.5\$cm and robust to distractors and partial occlusions using only data from a simulator with non-realistic random textures. To demonstrate the capabilities of our detectors, we show they can be used to perform grasping in a cluttered environment. To our knowledge, this is the first successful transfer of a deep neural network trained only on simulated RGB images (without pre-training on real images) to the real world for the purpose of robotic control.},

	abstract = {Discovery of fundamental principles which govern and limit effective locomotion (self-propulsion) is of intellectual interest and practical importance. Human technology has created robotic moving systems that excel in movement on and within environments of societal interest: paved roads, open air and water. However, such devices cannot yet robustly and efficiently navigate (as animals do) the enormous diversity of natural environments which might be of future interest for autonomous robots; examples include vertical surfaces like trees and cliffs, heterogeneous ground like desert rubble and brush, turbulent flows found near seashores, and deformable/flowable substrates like sand, mud and soil. In this review we argue for the creation of a physics of moving systems—a ‘locomotion robophysics’—which we define as the pursuit of principles of self-generated motion. Robophysics can provide an important intellectual complement to the discipline of robotics, largely the domain of researchers from engineering and computer science. The essential idea is that we must complement the study of complex robots in complex situations with systematic study of simplified robotic devices in controlled laboratory settings and in simplified theoretical models. We must thus use the methods of physics to examine both locomotor successes and failures using parameter space exploration, systematic control, and techniques from dynamical systems. Using examples from our and others’ research, we will discuss how such robophysical studies have begun to aid engineers in the creation of devices that have begun to achieve life-like locomotor abilities on and within complex environments, have inspired interesting physics questions in low dimensional dynamical systems, geometric mechanics and soft matter physics, and have been useful to develop models for biological locomotion in complex terrain. The rapidly decreasing cost of constructing robot models with easy access to significant computational power bodes well for scientists and engineers to engage in a discipline which can readily integrate experiment, theory and computation.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a Learning-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (LB-NMPC) algorithm for an autonomous mobile robot to reduce path-tracking errors over repeated traverses along a reference path. The LB-NMPC algorithm uses a simple a priori vehicle model and a learned disturbance model.

Modelling the disturbance as a GP enables interpolation and extrapolation of learned disturbances, a key feature of this algorithm. Localization for the controller is provided by an on-board, vision-based mapping and navigation system enabling operation in large-scale, GPS-denied environments. The paper presents experimental results including over 1.8 km of travel by a four-wheeled, 50 kg robot travelling through challenging terrain (including steep, uneven hills) and by a six-wheeled, 160 kg robot learning disturbances caused by unmodelled dynamics at speeds ranging from 0.35 m/s to 1.0 m/s. The speed is scheduled to balance trial time, path-tracking errors, and localization reliability based on previous experience. The results show that the system can start from a generic a priori vehicle model and subsequently learn to reduce vehicle- and trajectory-specific path-tracking errors based on experience.},

Our algorithm is able to find policies whose performance is competitive with those found by a planning algorithm with full access to the dynamics of the domain and its derivatives. We further demonstrate that for many of the tasks the algorithm can learn policies end-to-end: directly from raw pixel inputs.},

The issues of feasibility of the on-line optimization, stability and performance are largely understood for systems described by linear models. Much progress has been made on these issues for non-linear systems but for practical applications many questions remain, including the reliability and efficiency of the on-line computation scheme. To deal with model uncertainty ‘rigorously’ an involved dynamic programming problem must be solved. The approximation techniques proposed for this purpose are largely at a conceptual stage. Among the broader research needs the following areas are identified: multivariable system identification, performance monitoring and diagnostics, non-linear state estimation, and batch system control. Many practical problems like control objective prioritization and symptom-aided diagnosis can be integrated systematically and effectively into the MPC framework by expanding the problem formulation to include integer variables yielding a mixed-integer quadratic or linear program. Efficient techniques for solving these problems are becoming available.},

Our experimental results significantly extend the state of the art in autonomous helicopter flight. We used the following approach: First we had a pilot fly the helicopter to help us find a helicopter dynamics model and a reward (cost) function. Then we used a reinforcement learning (optimal control) algorithm to find a controller that is optimized for the resulting model and reward function. More specifically, we used differential dynamic programming (DDP), an extension of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR).},

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

	shorttitle = {Mind {Children}},
	abstract = {Imagine attending a lecture at the turn of the twentieth century in which Orville Wright speculates about the future of transportation, or one in which Alexander Graham Bell envisages satellite communications and global data banks. Mind Children, written by an internationally renowned roboticist, offers a comparable experience-a mind-boggling glimpse of a world we may soon share with our artificial progeny. Filled with fresh ideas and insights, this book is one of the most engaging and controversial visions of the future ever written by a serious scholar. Hans Moravec convincingly argues that we are approaching a watershed in the history of life-a time when the boundaries between biological and postbiological intelligence will begin to dissolve. Within forty years, Moravec believes, we will achieve human equivalence in our machines, not only in their capacity to reason but also in their ability to perceive, interact with, and change their complex environment. The critical factor is mobility. A computer rooted to one place is doomed to static iterations, whereas a machine on the prowl, like a mobile organism, must evolve a richer fund of knowledge about an ever-changing world upon which to base its actions. In order to achieve anything near human equivalence, robots will need, at the least, the capacity to perform ten trillion calculations per second. Given the trillion-fold increase in computational power since the end of the nineteenth century, and the promise of exotic technologies far surpassing the now-familiar lasers and even superconductors, Moravec concludes that our hardware will have no trouble meeting this forty-year timetable. But human equivalence is just the beginning, not an upper bound. Once the tireless thinking capacity of robots is directed to the problem of their own improvement and reproduction, even the sky will not limit their voracious exploration of the universe. In the concluding chapters Moravec challenges us to imagine with him the possibilities and pitfalls of such a scenario. Rather than warning us of takeover by robots, the author invites us, as we approach the end of this millennium, to speculate about a plausible, wonderful postbiological future and the ways in which our minds might participate in its unfolding.},

To learn hand-eye coordination for grasping, we trained a large convolutional neural network to predict the probability that task-space motion of the gripper will result in successful grasps, using only monocular camera images and independently of camera calibration or the current robot pose. This requires the network to observe the spatial relationship between the gripper and objects in the scene, thus learning hand-eye coordination. We then use this network to servo the gripper in real time to achieve successful grasps. To train our network, we collected over 800,000 grasp attempts over the course of two months, using between 6 and 14 robotic manipulators at any given time, with differences in camera placement and hardware. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method achieves effective real-time control, can successfully grasp novel objects, and corrects mistakes by continuous servoing.},

	abstract = {We present the Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL), a wearable robot designed to assist human workers with additional arms and legs attached to the wearer's body. The SRL can work closely with the wearer by holding an object, positioning a workpiece, operating a powered tool, securing the human body, and more. Although the SRL has the potential to provide the wearer with greater strength, higher accuracy, flexibility, and dexterity, its control performance is hindered by unpredictable disturbances due to involuntary motions of the wearer, which include postural sway and physiological tremor. This paper presents 1) a Kalman filter approach to estimate the state of the SRL despite the involuntary wearer's motion, and 2) a method for improving the accuracy and stabilizing the human body and the SRL. The dynamics of the human-SRL system are analyzed, including human-induced disturbance models based on biomechanics literature. A discrete Kalman filter is constructed and its performance is evaluated in terms of error covariance. A “bracing” technique is then introduced to suppress the human-induced disturbances; one robotic limb grasps an environment structure and uses it as a support to attenuate the disturbances. We show how bracing can be used to shape the stiffness parameters at the robot base. This in turn allows to enhance state estimation accuracy in the areas of the workspace where the user needs assistance.},

Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL) can hold objects, clamp them to a fixture, guide and support human hands, and assist the wearer in performing a task as a close co-worker. This paper focuses on a class of tasks where SRL physically interacts with the environment through contact. SRL makes contact with a wall and thereby braces the human body against the environment. SRL also guides the human hands by placing a drill jig over the drilling location. Bracing the human body and guiding the hands, SRL can enhance the drilling task stability and accuracy. The SRL technology is applied to aircraft assembly, where conventional industrial robots failed to perform effectively. First, the basic design concept of SRL is summarized, and task strategies using SRL and their functional requirements are described. Kinematic and static properties resulting from the structural closed loops formed around the SRL, the human, and the environment are analyzed, and effective strategies for physical disturbance rejection and fine positioning are discussed. A prototype robotic arm grasps the aircraft fuselage structure. Another robotic arm places a drill jig precisely on the fuselage structure, and guides and stabilizes a hand drill held by the human user. An optimization method is developed in order to identify the SRL kinematic configuration and joint torques that stabilize the drill and at the same time minimize the human workload.},

	abstract = {A wearable robot secured on the shoulder of a human is developed for assisting its wearer in the execution of tasks in the overhead workspace. Installing a ceiling panel is an example of such a task. During this task the robot can hold the panel or collaborate actively with the human in order to fix the panel with the appropriate equipment. This wearable robot, termed "Supernumerary Robotic Limbs", works closely with the human to streamline the operation and reduce the human workload. First, the design concept of the Robot-on-the-Shoulder system is described, and a new approach to the coordinated control between the wearable robot and the human is presented. A graphical task process representation based on Coloured Petri Nets (CPN) is used to model the concurrent and distributed nature of the human-robot system, which comprises two human hands and two robot hands. The CPN framework is then extended to a type of hybrid control system by imbedding local dynamic controllers in the Transition nodes of the CPN model. Each local dynamic controller collects sensor signals relevant to the target transition and makes a predictive control decision. This allows the robot on the shoulder to take a proactive and preemptive action as well as to confirm a successful Transition. The control parameters for these algorithms are tuned based on "teaching-by-showing" techniques using human demonstration data. Partial Least Squares is used for extracting significant sensor signals from high-dimensional sensor data in order to do real time predictions and control. A prototype robot-on-the-shoulder system is built, and the CPN hybrid control is implemented and tested for a ceiling panel installation task.},

Electric vehicles (EVs) with a single-ratio gearbox may provide high levels of smoothness, but using a multi-speed gearbox provides significant benefits in terms of vehicle acceleration, top speed, powertrain cost, mass, and energy consumption. AMTs can provide smooth shifts without torque interruption when coupled to a normally-open torque bypass clutch. However, conventional dry friction clutches are not best suited for such torque bypass due to wear and controllability concerns, while wet clutches would decrease powertrain efficiency due to viscous losses. An eddy current clutch would be highly controllable, simple to manufacture, low-cost, robust, and do not wear compared to friction clutches. The potential of eddy current clutches is assessed from a representative case study consisting of a ∼190 Nm clutch for a seamless two-speed AMT. The clutch design is based upon Wouterse's model, which is further refined using a Finite Element Analysis (FEA) on the clutch magnetic circuit. A prototype clutch is built and installed inside an existing AMT. The measured clutch coupling torque agrees well with Wouterse's model results, with a maximum error of 6\%. The AMT performed seamless gear upshifts on a test bench thanks to the eddy current clutch, which confirms their viability for torque bypass.},

	abstract = {Electric Vehicles (EVs) with single-ratio gearbox provide high levels of smoothness, but using multi-speed gearbox can provide significant benefits in terms of vehicle acceleration, top speed, powertrain cost, mass, and energy consumption. In particular, Automated Manual Transmissions (AMTs) have characteristics of smooth shifts without torque interruption when coupled to a torque bypass clutch. However, conventional friction clutches are not best suited as torque bypass clutches because of their limited controllability and because large amount of heat must be dissipated to slow down the motor during gearshifts. This paper studies the feasibility of a seamless AMT architecture for EVs and Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) using an eddy current torque bypass clutch that is highly controllable, robust, low cost, and has no wearable parts. A system-level study using a backward-facing model is used to assess the advantages of multi-speed gearboxes for EVs in terms of energy consumption, powertrain cost, and mass. A full-scale clutch prototype is designed for a custom two-speed AMT of an 80 kW EV. Numerical simulations show that a two-speed gearbox can improve energy consumption by 7.2 \% for a compact class EV such as the Nissan Leaf. Moreover, using two gear ratios allows a downsizing of the electric motor, which could reduce powertrain cost and mass by 23.1 \% and 15.6 \%, respectively. The clutch is characterized experimentally and its maximum torque agrees well with analytical results (within 6 \%). The prototype performed a seamless shift on a test bench demonstrating the viability of using an eddy current clutch for torque bypass clutches in AMTs.},

	abstract = {The current level of interest in electric vehicles (EVs) could hardly be overstated as manufacturers and governments around the world appear to have increased interest at a staggering rate. The resurgence of current interest in the early part of the 21st century has been driven by both political and technological developments, namely a requirement to control global emissions and the emergence of new battery designs with improved specific energy, energy density and rechargability properties. One of the great advantages of the electric motor is its torque characteristic which provides maximum torque from zero up to low speeds, and then it is governed by the maximum power available as motor speed increase. This has two significant advantages over the typical torque-speed properties of the competing IC engine: (1) It is fundamentally a more desirable characteristic spread of torque over the speed range in contrast to the peakiness of an IC engine. (2) It removes the need for any additional transmission clutch or gears. However, one of the main conclusions to emerge from the plethora of research work into energy efficient vehicles is that it is necessary to pursue every possible avenue for minor efficiency gains. It is therefore of interest to investigate whether it is possible to manage the efficiency of the electric motor, so that by using an intermediate gearbox the motor is operated more often in its higher efficiency region. The aim of this paper is to develop a simple EV model and predict its energy consumption with a variable and fixed ratio gearbox over a standard driving cycle in order to understand whether this could offer significant efficiency gains. The emerging conclusions are that it is possible to improve overall energy consumption levels by around 5 to 12\% with a variable ratio gearbox depending on the driving cycle used. However, there are many other practical considerations which must be weighed against this positive result and the paper discusses the - impact of several of these such as, gearbox efficiency, additional weight, cost and complexity, effect on drivability and potential for motor downsizing.},

	abstract = {This paper describes work being conducted by OC Robotics and Airbus to develop snake-arm robots to conduct assembly tasks within wing boxes - an area currently inaccessible for automation.The composite, single skin construction of aircraft structures presents new assembly challenges. Currently during box close-out it is necessary for aircraft fitters to climb into the wing box through small access panels and use manual or power tools to perform a variety of tasks. In future wing designs it may be that certain parts of the wing do not provide adequate access for manual assembly methods. It is also known that these manual interventions introduce health and safety concerns with their associated costs.Snake-arm robots provide a means to replace manual procedures by delivering the required tools to all areas of the wing box.Such a development has broader implications for aircraft design and assembly. There is potential for considerable cost savings for the aerospace industry through reduced weight, improved aerodynamics, standardisation of assembly processes, increased rate and reduced health and safety costs.This paper presents early results of the demonstration snake-arm robot and outlines expectations for future development. It also identifies critical design parameters for the snake-arm and considers the tools and processes delivered by the snake-arm.},

Despite this tradition, reducing interface stiffness offers a number of advantages, including greater shock tolerance, lower reflected inertia, more accurate and stable force control, less inadvertent damage to the environment, and the capacity for energy storage. As a trade-off, reducing interface stiffness also lowers zero motion force bandwidth. In this paper, the authors propose that for natural tasks, zero motion force bandwidth isn't everything, and incorporating series elasticity as a purposeful element within the actuator is a good idea. The authors use the term elasticity instead of compliance to indicate the presence of a passive mechanical spring in the actuator. After a discussion of the trade-offs inherent in series elastic actuators, the authors present a control system for their use under general force or impedance control. The authors conclude with test results from a revolute series-elastic actuator meant for the arms of the MIT humanoid robot Cog and for a small planetary rover},

The most important contribution of the paper is a method which first transcribes an optimal control problem into an equivalent problem parameterized by the switching instants and then obtains the values of the derivatives based on the solution of a two point boundary value differential algebraic equation formed by the state, costate, stationarity equations, the boundary and continuity conditions, along with their differentiations. This method is applied to general switched linear quadratic problems and an efficient method based on the solution of an initial value ordinary differential equation is developed. An extension of the method is also applied to problems with internally forced switching. Examples are shown to illustrate the results in the paper.},

A mathematical model of an electric vehicle powertrain is developed including a DC equivalent circuit model for the electric machine and multi-body dynamic model of the powertrain system is then developed and integrated with a hydraulic clutch control system model. Integral control of the powertrain is then performed through simulations on the develop powertrain system model for each of the four shift cases. These simulation results are then replicated on a full scale powertrain test rig. To evaluate the performance of results shift duration and vehicle jerk are used as metrics to demonstrate that the presented strategies are effective for shift control in electric vehicles.

This paper presents a new type of supernumerary robotic limbs (SRL) that supports the human body against floors, walls, and surrounding structures so that the human can perform a task safely, comfortably, and stably. First, the use of wearable robots for securing and supporting a human body is discussed, followed by an SRL design concept. The SRL is worn around the waist and can brace the human body by making contact with a wall, grasping a rail, or being anchored to the floor. Quasi-static stability and compliance with which the body is supported are analyzed. Two control methods for stabilizing the body support system are considered: one is null-space stabilization using Hessian matrices, and the other is joint servo stiffness, based on the Jacobian. A prototype robot is designed and tested. Potential applications of the SRL in diverse fields are discussed.},

The compliant transmission  of the macro-actuator reduces the impedance  (stiffness) at the output shaft and increases  the dynamic range of force. Performance  improvement over single actuator systems  was expected in force control, impedance  control, force distortion and reduction of  transient impact forces. A set of quantitative  measures is proposed and the actuator  system is evaluated against them: Force  Control Bandwidth, Position Bandwidth,  Dynamic Range, Impact Force, Impedance  ("Backdriveability'"), Force Distortion and  Force Performance Space. Several theoretical  performance limits are derived from the  saturation limits of the system. A control law is  proposed and control system performance is  compared to the theoretical limits. A prototype  testbed was built using permanenent magnet  motors and an experimental comparison was  performed between this actuator concept and  two single actuator systems. The following  performance was observed: Force bandwidth  of 56Hz, Torque Dynamic Range of 800:1,  Peak Torque of 1040mNm, Minimum Torque  of 1.3mNm. Peak Impact Force was reduced  by an order of magnitude. Distortion at small  amplitudes was reduced substantially.  Backdriven impedance was reduced by 2-3  orders of magnitude.

An RRT is iteratively expanded by applying control inputs that drive the system slightly toward randomly-selected points, as opposed to requiring point-to-point convergence, as in the probabilistic roadmap approach. Several desirable properties and a basic implementation of RRTs are discussed.

Although these methods have been successfully applied to many applications, simultaneous control of force and position cannot be achieved. Furthermore, collision safety has been of primary concern in recent years with emergence of service robots in direct contact with humans. To cope with such problems, redundant actuation has been used to enhance the performance of a position/force controller. In this paper, the novel design of a double actuator unit (DAU) composed of double actuators and a planetary gear train is proposed to provide the capability of simultaneous control of position and force as well as the improved collision safety. Since one actuator controls position and the other actuator modulates stiffness, DAU can control the position and stiffness simultaneously at the same joint. The torque exerted on the joint can be estimated without an expensive torque/force sensor. DAU is capable of detecting dynamic collision by monitoring the speed of the stiffness modulator. Upon detection of dynamic collision, DAU immediately reduces its joint stiffness according to the collision magnitude, thus providing the optimum collision safety. It is shown from various experiments that DAU can provide good performance of position tracking, force estimation and collision safety.},

The optimal control problem has its origin in automobile test-driving, where the car model involves a discrete-valued control function for the gear shift. Since the number of variables in (MINLP) grows with the number of grid points used for discretization of the optimal control problem, the example from automobile test-driving may serve as a benchmark problem of scalable complexity. Reference solutions are computed numerically for two different problem sizes. A simple heuristic approach suitable for optimal control problems is suggested that reduces the computational amount considerably, though it cannot guarantee optimality anymore.

Finally the proposed electric vehicle (EV) is compared with an EV with fixed-ratio gear box, and it is shown that the 2-speed AMT with a rear-mounted dry clutch has much better performance in terms of acceleration time, maximum speed and energy economy.

	abstract = {This paper describes the design concept of a new robot based on the direct-drive method using rare-earth d-c torque motors. Because these motors have high torque, light weight and compact size, we can construct robots with far better performance than those presently available. For example, we can eliminate all the transmission mechanisms, such as reducers and chain belts, between the motors and their loads, and construct a simple mechanism (direct-drive) where the arm links are directly coupled to the motor rotors. This elimination can lead to excellent performance: no backlash, low friction, low inertia, low compliance and high reliability, all of which are suited for high-speed, high-precision robots. First we propose a basic configuration of direct-drive robots. Second a general procedure for designing direct-drive robots is shown, and the feasibility of direct drive for robot actuation is discussed in terms of weights and torques of joints. One of the difficulties in designing direct-drive robots is that motors to drive wrist joints are loads for motors to drive elbow joints, and they are loads for motors at shoulders. To reduce this increasing series of loads is an essential issue for designing practical robots. We analyze the joint mass system for simplified kinematic model of the direct-drive robots, and show how the loads are reduced significantly by using rare-earth motors with light-weight and high torque. We also discuss optimum kinematic structures with minimum arm weight. Finally, we describe the direct-drive robotic manipulator (CMU arm) developed at Carnegie-Mellon University, and verify the design theory.},

	abstract = {The body representation in the human mind is dynamic, and illusions or traumatic events can modify it to include additional limbs. This remarkable adaptability of the central nervous system to different body configurations opens new possibilities in the field of human augmentation. In order to fully exploit this potential, we developed a new type of wearable co-robot that can perform tasks in close coordination with the human user. The system, named Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL), consists of two additional robotic arms worn through a backpack-like harness. The SRL can assist the user by holding objects, lifting weights and streamlining the execution of a task. If the SRL perform movements closely coordinated with the user and exhibit human-like dynamics, they might be incorporated into the body representation and perceived as parts of the user's body. As a result, the human would be able to extend the range of available skills and manipulation possibilities, performing tasks more effectively and with less effort. This paper presents a communication, estimation and control method for the SRL, aimed to perform tasks in tight coordination with the wearer. The SRL observes the user motion, and actively assists the human by employing a coordinated control algorithm. In particular, skills involving the direct cooperation of two human workers are transferred to the SRL and a single user. Demonstration data of the two humans - a leader and an assistant - are analyzed and a state estimation algorithm is extracted from them. This can be used to control the SRL accordingly with the used end effectors. A causal relationship relating the assistant's motion to the leader's motion is identified based on System Identification methods. This approach is applied to a drilling operation performed by two workers. An effective coordination skill is identified and transferred to the SRL, to make them act like the human follower.},

Based on the concept of maximum acceleration capacity, a methodology for the determination of gear ratios in geared robotic mechanisms is developed. It is found that, in the optimum design, the mass inertia matrix of the input links reflected at the joint-space is equal to that of the major links, and the maximum acceleration capacity is independent of the gear train arrangement. Several two-DOF geared robotic mechanisms are used as design examples to illustrate the principle. Using this methodology, mechanisms can be designed to yield optimum dynamic performance},

Next one introduces a basic formula for controlling stiffness of the joint as well as its angles using multiple ANLESes. A new mechanism for the wrist joint having three DOF is proposed on the practical feasibility base, in which only four ANLESes with one additional DC-motor are used to control the stiffness of the three DOF wrist.

The backdrivability is important and necessary for robots that operate around our life space to guarantee the safety of us, themselves and environments. A rotational actuator with a high reduction ratio reducer has been commonly used in traditional robotics field, but it cannot realize the high-backdrivability without any sensory feedback. In this study, several high-backdrivable shaft actuators are used instead of it. Moreover, the CVT mechanism which is brought by a novel configuration of the parallel mechanism is employed effectively. To utilize multiple shaft actuators with the CVT mechanism is able to surmount a drawback of the shaft actuator whose output force is relatively weak. A simple 1 DOF manipulator is proposed as the first step of this study. Firstly, its kinematic and dynamic models are given. Next, a PD type feedback control signal to regulate the arm's angle and the CVT simultaneously is designed. A static relation between an output end-point force and the CVT mechanism is analyzed. Finally, several fundamental experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of proposed mechanism.},

We also demonstrate that a one-step time horizon control strategy using the same low-level controller can provide performance which is surprisingly comparable to that of the infinite time horizon optimal policy. The model presented here uses a torque at the hip and an axially-directed impulsive toe-off applied just before each ground collision. Our results provide compelling evidence that actuated robots based on passive dynamic principles (e.g. no ankle torque) should inherently be capable of walking on significantly rough terrain.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses the closed-loop control of an actuator with both a continuous input variable (motor torque) and a discrete input variable (mode selection). In many applications, robots have to bear large loads while moving slowly and also have to move quickly through the air with almost no load, leading to conflicting requirements for their actuators. An actuator with multiple gear ratios, like in a powertrain, can address this issue by allowing an effective use of power over a wide range of output speed. However, having discrete modes of operation adds complexity to the high-level control and planning. Here a controller for two-speed actuators that automatically select both the best gear ratio and the motor torque is developed. The approach is to: first derive a low-dimensional model, then use dynamic programming to find the best actions for all possible situations, and last use regression analysis to extract simplified global feedback laws. This approach produces simple practical nearly-optimal feedback laws. A controller that globally minimizes a quadratic cost function is derived for a two-speed actuator prototype, global stability is proven and performance is demonstrated experimentally.},

This leads to conflicting requirements for their actuators. Multiple gear ratios, like in a powertrain, address this issue by allowing an effective use of power over a wide range of output speed. However in robotics, as opposed to powertrains, the controlled load is not always inertial and acting as a low-pass filter; hence gear shifting is a more challenging issue in a robotics context. In this paper, it is proposed to address this problem using a dual-speed dual-motor architecture to maintain full control of the output during gear shifting. A dynamic model is developed and a controller using the redundancy of motors is proposed to enable fast seamless gear shifting even when interacting with unknown dynamic environments. Results are demonstrated with a proof-of-concept linear actuator.},

X-screw also has built-in overload protection since it will stop advancing if the load exceeds a certain value although the motor is able to continue to rotate.

	abstract = {Solving an optimal control or estimation problem is not easy. Pieces of the puzzle are found scattered throughout many different disciplines. Furthermore, the focus of this book is on practical methods, that is, methods that I have found actually work! In fact everything described in this book has been implemented in production software and used to solve real optimal control problems. Although the reader should be proficient in advanced mathematics, no theorems are presented. Traditionally, there are two major parts of a successful optimal control or optimal estimation solution technique. The first part is the “optimization” method. The second part is the “differential equation” method. When faced with an optimal control or estimation problem it is tempting to simply “paste” together packages for optimization and numerical integration. While naive approaches such as this may be moderately successful, the goal of this book is to suggest that there is a better way! The methods used to solve the differential equations and optimize the functions are intimately related. The first two chapters of this book focus on the optimization part of the problem. In Chapter 1 the important concepts of nonlinear programming for small dense applications are introduced. Chapter 2 extends the presentation to problems which are both large and sparse. Chapters 3 and 4 address the differential equation part of the problem. Chapter 3 introduces relevant material in the numerical solution of differential (and differentialalgebraic) equations. Methods for solving the optimal control problem are treated in some detail in Chapter 4. Throughout the book the interaction between optimization and integration is emphasized. Chapter 5 describes how to solve optimal estimation problems. Chapter 6 presents a collection of examples that illustrate the various concepts and techniques. Real world problems often require solving a sequence of optimal control and/or optimization problems, and Chapter 7 describes a collection of these “advanced applications.” While the book incorporates a great deal of new material not covered in Practical Methods for Optimal Control Using Nonlinear Programming [21], it does not cover everything. Many important topics are simply not discussed in order to keep the overall presentation concise and focused. The discussion is general and presents a unified approach to solving optimal estimation and control problems. Most of the examples are drawn from my experience in the aerospace industry. Examples have been solved using a particular implementation called  SOCS.{\textless}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{\textgreater} {\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="double-struck"{\textgreater}SOCS{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}.{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater} {\textless}/math{\textgreater}  I have tried to adhere to notational conventions from both optimization and control theory whenever possible.

This paper presents an analytical model for the simulation, analysis and control of shift dynamics for DCT vehicles. A dynamic model and the control logic for the integrated vehicle have been developed using Matlab/Simulink as the simulation platform. The model has been used to study the variation in output torque in response to different clutch pressure profiles during shifts. Optimized clutch pressure profiles have been created for the best possible shift quality based on model simulation. As a numerical example, the model is used for a DCT vehicle to simulate the wide-open throttle performance. Vehicle launch and shift process are both simulated to assess transmission shift quality and validate the effectiveness of the shift control.},

Along with its good positioning accuracy, the technology presents advantages of compactness, perfect MRI-compatibility, simplicity and low cost. Here, we specifically report the design and validation of a transperineal prostate cancer manipulator prototype that has 20 embedded air-muscles distributed in four star-like polymer structures. These compliant structures are made of silicone elastomer, using lost-core injection molding. Low motion hysteresis and good precision are achieved by designing molded joints that eliminate sliding surfaces. An effective design method for such embedded polymer air-muscles is proposed, using a manipulator model and four air-muscle design models: geometrical, finite elements, uniaxial analytic, and experimental. Binary control of each air-muscle ensures stability and accuracy with minimized costs and complexity. The prototype is found MRI-compatible with no observable effects on the signal-to-noise ratio and, with appropriate image feedback, is found to reach targets with precision and accuracy under 0.5 mm. The embedded approach reveals to be a key feature since it reduces hysteresis errors by a factor of ≈7 compared to a previous nonembedded version of the manipulator. The successful validation of this binary manipulator opens the door to a new design paradigm for low cost and highly capable pneumatic robots.},

	abstract = {Polymer-based binary robots and mechatronics devices can lead to simple, robust, and cost effective solutions for Magnetic Resonnace Image-guided (MRI) medical procedures. A binary manipulator using 12 elastically averaged air muscles has been proposed for MRI-guided biopsies and brachytherapies procedures used for prostate cancer diagnostic and treatment. In this design, radially-distributed air muscles position a needle guide relatively to the MRI table. The system constitutes an active compliant mechanism where the compliance relieves the over-constraint imposed by the redundant parallel architecture. This paper presents experimental results for repeatability, accuracy, and stiffness of a fully functional manipulator prototype. Results show an experimental repeatability of 0.1 mm for point-to-point manipulation on a workspace diameter of 80 mm. Manipulator average accuracy is 4.7 mm when based on the nominal (uncalibrated) model and improves to 2.1 mm when using a calibrated model. The estimated stiffness at the end-effector is ∼0.95 N/mm and is sufficient to withstand the needle insertion forces without major deflection. Needle trajectories during state change appear to be primarily driven by the system’s elastic energy gradient. The study shows the manipulator prototype to meet its design criteria and to have the potential of becoming an effective and low-cost manipulator for MRI-guided prostate cancer treatment.},

	abstract = {Hybrid systems are a modeling framework that allows for the combined consideration of continuous and discrete state dynamics. They are described by a finite collection of continuous systems, with each of these continuous dynamics corresponding to discrete modes of operation. Hidden mode hybrid systems are the special case when the mode is unknown or hidden and mode transitions are autonomous. In addition, by allowing unknown inputs in this framework, both deterministic and stochastic disturbance inputs and noise signals can be considered. There are a large number of applications, such as autonomous systems with contact, urban transportation systems, human-automation systems as well as fault and attack identification in cyber-physical systems. However, the literature on feedback control and estimation approaches for such systems is rather sparse. The main contribution of this thesis is the development of fundamental theory and computationally efficient algorithms for feedback control and estimation of hidden mode hybrid systems. In the first part of the thesis, we consider the feedback control problem of hidden mode hybrid systems with input amplitude and rate constraints. We propose a single hidden mode control law that applies to all modes, as opposed to existing control designs in which a controller is designed for each mode and the switching between controllers are based on mode estimates. This technique was applied to the problems of dynamic landing of a helicopter and robot walking without ground contact sensors and to the control of a car with automatic transmission. In the second part of the thesis, we develop inference algorithms for simultaneously estimating states, unknown inputs and hidden modes of stochastic switched linear systems, along with an analysis of their properties. We first design simultaneous state and input estimators for a more general class of linear systems. Then, we make use of a multiple model framework to additionally estimate the hidden mode. These inference algorithms provide the initial steps towards the realization of smart vehicles that can infer the hidden intention of other drivers without explicit communication, as well as smart power grids with reliable estimates despite faults or malicious attacks on its topology, actuators and sensors.},

	copyright = {http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/7582},
	url = {http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/103432},
	abstract = {Planning dynamic motions for a legged robot entails addressing both the continuous question of how its joints should move and the combinatorial question of which hand or foot should touch which surface and in what order. Fortunately, these two questions are linked by the centroidal dynamics of the robot, which we can express either in terms of its joint angle trajectories or in terms of its foot placements and applied forces. Based on this insight, I formulate a pair of mathematical programs for planning highly dynamic motions for legged robots. The first is a mixed-integer convex program, specifically, a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP), that yields a sequence of footholds/handholds as well as center of mass (COM) and angular momentum trajectories. The second is a trajectory optimization, formulated as a nonlinear program (NLP), that returns trajectories for the COM, angular momentum, and joint angles subject to the footholds/handholds chosen by the MIQP step. While any number of trajectory optimization schemes could be used here, we present one which is particularly useful in this case, as it enforces the system's dynamics directly in terms of its COM motion and angular momentum. As a result, the solution to the MIQP provides constraints (where each end-effector is required to make contact with the environment) for the NLP and also gives seeds for the decision variables corresponding to the robot's centroidal motion. Thus, the three primary contributions of this thesis are: an MIQP-based approach to gait selection over irregular terrain, a trajectory optimization formulation for floating-base systems subject to external forces and kinematic constraints, and a planning methodology that integrates both of those to generate highly dynamic motions in challenging environments. I apply these techniques to models of a quadruped and a humanoid (Boston Dynamics' LittleDog and Atlas respectively) to generate motion plans for running, jumping, and other dynamic behaviors.},

Based on this principle, lightweight robotic systems can be made fast and strong; exploiting the natural load dynamics for moving at higher speeds (small reduction ratio), while also able to bear a large load through the attenuation of the load dynamics (large reduction ratio). A model-based control algorithm to automatically select the optimal gear-ratios that minimize the total actuator torques for an arbitrary dynamic state and expected uncertainty level is proposed. Also, a novel 3-DoF robot arm using custom actuators with two discrete gear-ratios is presented. The advantages of gear- shifting dynamically are demonstrated through experiments and simulations. Results show that actively changing the gear-ratio using the proposed control algorithms can lead to an order-of- magnitude reduction of necessary actuator torque and power, and also increase robustness to disturbances.},

In this paper, we present a novel method, exploiting redundancies in the elbow, to control a pair of extra robotic fingers, termed Supernumerary Robotic Fingers or SR Fingers for short, to perform “hold-and-manipulate” tasks. Two control protocols are explored here. One protocol enables discrete transition between different modes of motion, while the other continuously controls grasping behavior of the SR Fingers. Four robot assisted “hold-and-manipulate” tasks are examined, including twisting off the cap of a water bottle, opening the lid of a food container, plugging a cable into an electronic device, and mixing salad in a bowl. Through the successful completion of these tasks, we demonstrate that wearable extra fingers have the potential to provide those with impaired hands the opportunity to live with more independence and work more productively.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a systematic methodology for on-site identification and energy-optimal path planning of an industrial robot. The identification experiments are carried out on-site, in a quick, non-invasive way using a CA8335 Qualistar three-phase electrical networks analyser. Next, the collected data is compared with a parametrised dynamic robot model in an optimisation routine. This routine results in the specification of a parametric dynamic robot model. The model is used as a dynamic constraint for a model predictive control problem, where other physical constraints are added i.e. the limited workspace and the constraints on the joint velocities and accelerations. A sequential quadratic programming solver is used to minimise a mechanical energy based cost function. The resulting energy-optimal path is translated into custom robot commands executable on an industrial robot. The systematic methodology is validated on an IRB1600 industrial ABB robot performing a custom pick-and- place operation. The obtained dynamic robot model is given and compared to the collected measurements. To demonstrate the possibility of energy saving by ‘intelligently’ programming a robot trajectory the energy and time-optimal paths are generated taking all physical constraints into account. Simulation results show a significant time and energy improvement (up to 5\%) compared to most trajectories generated by the ABB software. The most remarkable result is that the fastest energy-optimal trajectory turns out to be 4\% more energy efficient and 3\% faster then the commercially available fastest trajectory. Additional stand-still experiments show that activation of the brakes is favoured over an actuated stand-still from an energy point of view, assuming that the start-up time when releasing the brakes is limited.},

While AwAS tunes the stiffness by regulating the position of the compliant elements along the lever arm, AwAS-II changes the position of the lever's pivot point. As a result of the new principle, AwAS-II can change the stiffness in a much broader range (from zero to infinity) even by using softer springs and shorter lever arm, compared to AwAS. This makes the setup of AwAS-II more compact and lighter and improves the stiffness regulation response. To evaluate the aptitude of the fast stiffness adjustment, experiments on reproducing the stiffness profile of the human ankle during the stance phase of a normal walking gait are conducted. Results indicate that AwAS-II is capable of reproducing an interpolated stiffness profile of the ankle while providing a net positive work and thus a sufficient amount of energy as required for the toe-off.},

The joints of the hyper articulated arm have no dedicated actuators but are activated by gravity. By tilting the base link appropriately, the gravitational torque drives the unactuated links to a desired angular position. With simple locking mechanisms, the hyperarticulated arm can change its configuration using only one actuator at the base. This underactuated arm design was motivated by the need for a compact snake-like robot that can go into aircraft wings and perform assembly operations using heavy end-effectors. The dynamics of the unactuated links are essentially second-order nonholonomic constraints for which there are no general methods to design closed-loop control. We propose a nonlinear closed-loop control law that is guaranteed to be stable in positioning one unactuated joint at a time. We synthesize a Lyapunov function to prove the convergence of this control scheme. The Lyapunov function also generates estimates of the domain of convergence of the control law for various control gains. The control algorithm is implemented on a prototype three-link system. Finally, we provide some experimental results to demonstrate the efficacy of the control scheme.},

After the surface normal vector is calculated based on the laser sensors’ feedback, the 2-EDNA concept is conceived specifically to address the deviation of the spindle from the surface normal at the drilling point. Following the angle calculation, depending on the actual initial position, two precise eccentric disks (PEDs) with an identical eccentric radius are used to rotate with the appropriate angles using two high-resolution DC servomotors. The two PEDs will carry the spindle to coincide with the surface normal, keeping the vertex of the drill bit still to avoid repeated adjustment and position compensation. A series of experiments was conducted on an aeronautical drilling robot platform with a precise NAC. The effect of normal adjustment on bore diameter, drilling force, burr size, drilling heat, and tool wear was analyzed. The results validate that using the NAC in robotic drilling results in greatly improved vertical drilling quality and is attainable in terms of intelligence and accuracy.},

In the proposed scheme, a desired vectorial system output, such as a position or a force, is commanded by recruiting actuators based on their influence vectors on the output. No analytical model of the system is needed; influence vectors are identified experimentally by sequentially activating each actuator. For position control tasks, the controller uses a probabilistic approach and a genetic algorithm to determine an optimal combination of actuators to recruit. For motion control tasks, the controller uses a sliding mode approach and independent recruiting decision for each actuator. Experimental results on a four degrees of freedom binary manipulator with 20 actuators confirm the method's effectiveness and its ability to tolerate massive perturbations and numerous actuator failures.},

In this paper, a soft two-DOF dielectric elastomer (DE) sensor is specifically designed to provide accurate position feedback for a soft polymer robotic manipulator. The technology is exemplified on a soft robot intended for MRI-guided prostate interventions. DEs are chosen for their major advantages of softness, high strains, low cost, and embedded multiple-DOF sensing capability, providing excellent system integration. A geometrical model of the proposed DE sensor is developed and compared to experimental results in order to understand sensor mechanics. Using a differential measurement approach, a handmade prototype provided linear sensory behavior and 0.2 mm accuracy on two-DOF. This correlates to a 0.7\% error over the sensor's 30 mm × 30 mm planar range, demonstrating the outstanding potential of DE technology for accurate multiDOF position sensing.},

The variable stiffness approach has been used to address this problem. We propose a hybrid dual actuator unit (HDAU) which is a novel variable stiffness unit design. The HDAU is composed of a hybrid control module based on an adjustable moment arm mechanism and a drive module with two motors. By controlling the relative motion of gears in the hybrid control module, position and stiffness can be simultaneously controlled for the same joint. The HDAU provides a wide range of joint stiffness due to nonlinearity obtained from the adjustable moment arm. The joint stiffness can be kept constant independent of the passive deflection angle of the output shaft. Furthermore, stable interaction can also be achieved because the joint stiffness is indirectly adjusted by position control of the hybrid control module. The characteristics of the HDAU are analyzed in this study. We show by experiment that the HDAU can provide a wide range of stiffness variation and rapid response for stiffness change.},

	abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account, deeply rooted in psychological and neuroscientific perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

A probability-based estimation of the relevance is suggested by first projecting the motion data onto a generic latent space using principal component analysis.

This provides a measure of the spatio-temporal correlations across the different modalities collected from the robot, which can be used to determine a metric of the imitation performance. The trajectories are then generalized using Gaussian mixture regression.

We also demonstrate that a one-step time horizon control strategy using the same low-level controller can provide performance which is surprisingly comparable to that of the infinite time horizon optimal policy. The model presented here uses a torque at the hip and an axially-directed impulsive toe-off applied just before each ground collision.

The key contribution of this brief is the estimation of the system's impulse response using input/output measurements from previous iterations, hereby eliminating time-consuming identification experiments. The estimated impulse response is used in a norm-optimal iterative learning controller, where actuator limitations can be formulated as linear inequality constraints. Experimental validation on a linear motor positioning system shows the ability of the proposed data-driven framework to: 1) achieve tracking accuracy up to the repeatability of the test setup; 2) minimize the rms value of the tracking error while respecting the actuator input constraints; 3) learn energy-optimal system inputs for point-to-point motions.},

	abstract = {In contrast to common rigid or actively compliant systems, Variable Stiffness Arms are capable of storing potential energy in their joint and convert it into kinetic energy, respectively speed. This capability is well known from humans and is a good example for the outstanding performance of biological systems. However, only since some years intrinsic compliance is considered as a key feature and not a drawback in robot design. Therefore, only very little work has been carried out on exploiting the natural dynamics of elastic arms for such explosive motion sequences. In this paper, we treat the problem of how to optimally achieve maximum link velocity at a given final time for Variable Stiffness Arms. We show that solutions to this problem lead to excitation motions, which enable the robot to move on the link side at much higher speed than on the motor side. In particular, the robot uses the dynamic transfer of elastic joint energy into link side kinetic energy for further acceleration. In our work we consider the practically relevant input and state constraints, and give experimental verification of the developed methods on the new DLR Hand-Arm system.},

This problem has great practical significance in many UAV applications. However, it has received little attention in the literature so far. Flying with a suspended load can be a very challenging and sometimes hazardous task as the suspended load significantly alters the flight characteristics of the quadrotor. In order to deal with this problem, we propose a technique based on dynamic programming which ensures swing-free trajectory tracking. We start by presenting the mathematical model of a quadrotor with suspended load dynamics and kinematics. A high-level planner is used to provide desired waypoints, and then a dynamic programming approach is used to generate the swing-free trajectory for the quadrotor carrying a suspended load. Effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by numerical simulations and experiments.},

	abstract = {In this study, we consider the control problem of a hybrid actuation system that is composed of more than two different types of actuators. Even though actuators are one crucial component for developing a robot with many degrees of freedom, such as humanoid and exoskeleton robots, technical difficulties and costs complicate the development of new actuators. On the other hand, since different types of actuators provide various strengths and weaknesses, an efficient approach will probably combine different types of actuators to design a novel actuation system. The crucial issue for such a hybrid actuator is a method that distributes the necessary torque/force to different actuators for generating target movements. We propose using an optimal control method to find the torque distribution strategy for hybrid actuators. We consider an optimal torque distribution method for a pneumatic-electric (P-E) hybrid actuator model that is used in our newly developed exoskeleton robot XoR. We present a control approach with a trajectory-based optimal control method with minimum energy criterion. Focusing on the robot's ankle joint, we apply our control method in numerical simulations and demonstrate that it reasonably finds the optimal torque distribution strategy based on the nature of the given task, and the results of high control performance.},

ROCR, pronounced “Rocker,” is a pendular, two-link, serial-chain robot that utilizes alternating handholds and an actuated tail to propel itself upward in a climbing style based on observation of human climbers and brachiating gibbons. ROCR's bioinspired pendular climbing strategy is simple and efficient. In fact, to our knowledge, ROCR is also the first climbing robot that is designed for efficiency. ROCR is a lightweight, flexible, and self-contained robot. This robot is intended for autonomous surveillance and inspection on sheer vertical surfaces. Potential locomotion gait strategies were investigated in simulation using Working Model 2D, and were evaluated on a basis of climbing rate, energy efficiency, and whether stable open-loop climbing was achieved. We identified that the most effective climbing resulted from sinusoidal tail motions. The addition of a body stabilizer reduced the robot's out-of-plane motion at higher frequencies and promoted more reliable gripper attachment. Experimental measurements of the robot showed climbing efficiencies of over 20\% and a specific resistance of 5.0, while consuming 27 J/m at a maximum climbing speed of 15.7 cm/s (0.34 body lengths/s) - setting a first benchmark for efficiency of climbing robots. Future work will include further design optimization, integration of more complex gripping mechanisms, and investigating more complex control strategies.},

Rather, the robot is equipped with passive joints, i.e., joints without actuator or sensor, which permit changing the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters such as the link length and twist angle. The passive joints will become controllable when the robot forms a closed kinematic chain. Also, each passive joint is equipped with a built-in brake mechanism that is normally locked, but the lock can be released whenever the parameters are to be changed. Such a versatile and agile robot is particularly suitable for space application for its simple, compact, and light design. The kinematics and recalibration of this kind of reconfigurable robot are thoroughly analyzed. A stable reconfiguration-control algorithm is devised to take the robot from one configuration to another by directly regulating the passive joints to the associated, desired DH parameters. Conditions for the observability and the controllability of the passive joints are also derived in detail.},

After providing a brief review of MINLP optimization, we present an overview of GDP for the case of convex functions emphasizing the quality of continuous relaxations of alternative reformulations that include the big-M and the hull relaxation. We then review disjunctive branch and bound as well as logic-based decomposition methods that circumvent some of the limitations in traditional MINLP optimization. We next consider the case of linear GDP problems to show how a hierarchy of relaxations can be developed by performing sequential intersection of disjunctions. Finally, for the case when the GDP problem involves nonconvex functions, we propose a scheme for tightening the lower bounds for obtaining the global optimum using a combined disjunctive and spatial branch and bound search.

The most complicated of these models has 5 links (a body and two arms, each with 2 links) and 7 degrees of freedom in flight. The defining feature of all our periodic solutions is that all collisions are at zero relative velocity. These motions are found using numerical integration and root-finding that is sufficiently precise so as to imply that the solutions found correspond to mathematical solutions with exactly zero energy cost. The only actuation and control in the model is for maintaining contact with and releasing handholds which requires no mechanical work. The similarity of these energy-free simulations to the motions of apes suggests that muscle-use minimization at least partially characterizes the coordination strategies they use.},

The timing of engagement and disengagement of the two clutches is critical for achieving a smooth shift without engine flare and clutch tie-up. This paper presents an analytical model for the simulation, analysis and control of shift dynamics for DCT vehicles. A dynamic model and the control logic for the integrated vehicle have been developed using Matlab/Simulink as the simulation platform. The model has been used to study the variation in output torque in response to different clutch pressure profiles during shifts. Optimized clutch pressure profiles have been created for the best possible shift quality based on model simulation. As a numerical example, the model is used for a DCT vehicle to simulate the wide-open throttle performance. Vehicle launch and shift process are both simulated to assess transmission shift quality and validate the effectiveness of the shift control.},

	abstract = {The paper addresses some of the fundamental problems of energy efficiency, design, and adaptive gait control of quadru ped walking vehicles. The design principle of a leg called a gravitationally decoupled actuator (GDA) is shown to be indispensable for realizing energetically efficient walking mo tion. A novel mechanism, the three-dimensional Cartesian- coordinate pantograph (PANTOMEC), which follows the GDA principle and has a lightweight structure, is introduced. A constructed quadruped walking vehicle model is then de scribed : the walking vehicle has the PANTOMEC leg mecha nisms, eight tactile sensors and a posture detector, and is hierarchically controlled by a microcomputer. Comparatively high energy efficiency and a certain degree of terrain adapt ability is demonstrated. It is thus shown that a practical walking vehicle can be designed using the proposed method.
The adaptive gait control problem is formalized, and an algorithm for terrain-adaptive gait control is presented. By computer simulation, it is shown that the algorithm produces an efficient gait while avoiding "deadlock" positions in nego tiating terrain. The algorithm is shown to be applicable for the control of future quadruped walking vehicles with visual sensors.},

	abstract = {Due to technological limitations robot actuators are often designed for specific tasks with narrow performance goals, whereas a wide range of output and behaviours is necessary for robots to operate autonomously in uncertain complex environments. We present a design framework that employs dynamic couplings in the form of brakes and clutches to increase the performance and diversity of linear actuators. The couplings are used to switch between a diverse range of discrete modes of operation within a single actuator. We also provide a design solution for miniaturized couplings that use dry friction to produce rapid switching and high braking forces. The couplings are designed so that once engaged or disengaged no extra energy is consumed. We apply the design framework and coupling design to a linear series elastic actuator (SEA) and show that this relatively simple implementation increases the performance and adds new behaviours to the standard design. Through a number of performance tests we are able to show rapid switching between a high and a low impedance output mode; that the actuator's spring can be charged to produce short bursts of high output power; and that the actuator has additional passive and rigid modes that consume no power once activated. Robots using actuators from this design framework would see a vast increase in their behavioural diversity and improvements in their performance not yet possible with conventional actuator design.},

	abstract = {Direct drive is an ideal drive method which has excellent features including no backlash, low friction, and high mechanical stiffness. Applying the direct drive method to robot arms, however, leads to an impractical design because of the following two drawbacks. One is that a direct-drive arm tends to be heavier than a conventional arm with transmission mechanisms; because the motors of direct-drive arm are located at each joint of the arm the weight of each motor is a load to the previous motors down the serial linkage of the arm. Another problem is insufficient drive torques due to the elimination of gears which amplify the motor torques. This paper describes a lightweight arm mechanism for the direct-drive robots. The major improvements are: (1) the serial link mechanism is replaced by a four-bar-link mechanism in order to avoid the mounting of heavy motors at the serial links, (2) high performance brushless motors have been developed so that large torques can be obtained with relatively small power dissipation. Throughout the basic analysis and experiments, the arm which has been developed is evaluated in terms of efficiency, load capacity and dynamic response.},

	abstract = {The electric vehicle is becoming increasingly prevalent as a viable option to replace hydrocarbon fuelled vehicles, and as such the development of high efficiency fully electric drivetrains is a particularly relevant research topic. The drivetrain topology is one of the main focuses of research on fully electric drivetrains, because of the variety of available options. For example, the adoption of multiple-speed mechanical transmissions can improve both the performance and energy consumption when compared to a single-speed transmission. A four-speed, dual motor drivetrain design is presented in this article which works on the principle of two double-speed transmissions, each driven by a separate motor linked through a sole secondary shaft. This drivetrain architecture provides increased flexibility of the electric motor operating points, theoretically being beneficial to the overall efficiency of the system for any driving condition. This paper presents the design of the transmission, its governing equations and the method adopted to optimize the state selection map and electric motor torque distribution. A backward-facing energy consumption model is used to compare the results of the four-speed transmission with those of single- and double-speed transmissions for four case study vehicles. © 2012 IEEE.},

	abstract = {This paper describes a mechanism which has six degrees of freedom, controlled in any combination by six motors, each having a ground abutment. It is considered that by its particular arrangement, this mechanism may form an elegant design for simulating flight conditions in the training of pilots. Unlike most simulators, it has no fixed axes relative to the ground, and therefore within the limits of amplitude of the design it can truly simulate the conditions of banking by carrying the simulation of control surfaces into the axes of the new attitude.
Variations in control arrangements are described and their respective design merits considered.
Other possible uses for this mechanism are mentioned, including automation of production.},

	abstract = {Dynamic interaction with the environment is fundamental to the process of manipulation. This paper describes an approach to the design of ‘interaction controllers’ and contrasts this with an approach to servo design. The need for ‘coupled stability’ and ‘interactive behaviour’ specifications is motivated. A necessary and sufficient condition to ensure the stability of a linear manipulator coupled at a single interaction port to a linear, passive environment is found. It is shown that this condition may be extended to a broad class of active environments, and a simple test for coupled stability, based on the root locus, is presented. Two interaction controller designs for a linear manipulator are presented. Interactive behaviour is analysed in the frequency domain by comparison with the behaviour of a target model. A simple controller shows strong stability properties, but poor behaviour; a more sophisticated design shows that it is possible to achieve desirable behaviour while retaining stability guarantees.},

The modularization and integration of the robot components enable low complexity in the design and assembly. The hybrid actuation concept has been validated on a two-degree-of-freedom prototype arm. The experimental results show the significant improvement that can be achieved with hybrid actuation over an actuation system with pneumatic artificial muscles alone.

The vertical stiffness controlled leg was tested on a material testing device to calibrate the mechanical impedance of the leg. By compensating transmission impedance from commanded torque, the leg was able to estimate impact force. For the impact test, the mean absolute error as a ratio of full scale sensor force is 0.041 in the 3406 N/m stiffness experiment and is 0.049 in the 5038 N/m experiment.

The gear shift operation is stated as a multistage decision process by making use of the dynamic programming method. Thereby, the synchronization of the gear box is formulated as a constraint at the end of the process. A control law is derived analytically in an explicit form by minimizing the performance measure over each process stage. Simulation results show a significant improvement in terms of gear shift comfort by different driving load cases. Furthermore, the shift time and the frictional losses in the shift elements can be reduced by applying the proposed control.},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatible robots can assist physicians with the insertion of biopsy needles and needle-like therapeutic instruments directly into millimeter-size tumors, using MR images as feedback. However, MRI systems present a challenging environment with high magnetic fields and limited space, making the development of MRI-compatible robots complex. This paper presents an MRI-compatible pneumatic actuation technology consisting of molded polymer structures with embedded air-muscles operated in a binary fashion. Along with its good positioning accuracy, the technology presents advantages of compactness, perfect MRI-compatibility, simplicity and low cost. Here, we specifically report the design and validation of a transperineal prostate cancer manipulator prototype that has 20 embedded air-muscles distributed in four star-like polymer structures. These compliant structures are made of silicone elastomer, using lost-core injection molding. Low motion hysteresis and good precision are achieved by designing molded joints that eliminate sliding surfaces. An effective design method for such embedded polymer air-muscles is proposed, using a manipulator model and four air-muscle design models: geometrical, finite elements, uniaxial analytic, and experimental. Binary control of each air-muscle ensures stability and accuracy with minimized costs and complexity. The prototype is found MRI-compatible with no observable effects on the signal-to-noise ratio and, with appropriate image feedback, is found to reach targets with precision and accuracy under 0.5 mm. The embedded approach reveals to be a key feature since it reduces hysteresis errors by a factor of ≈7 compared to a previous nonembedded version of the manipulator. The successful validation of this binary manipulator opens the door to a new design paradigm for low cost and highly capable pneumatic robots.},

The film's viscous forces increase actuator life and the short power-on times minimize energy losses through current leakage. This paper presents a design paradigm that exploits these fundamental properties of DEAs called discrete actuation. Discrete actuation uses DEAs at high stretch rates to change the states of robotic or mechatronic systems in discrete steps. Each state of the system is stable and can be maintained without actuator power. Discrete actuation can be used in robotic and mechatronic applications such as manipulation and locomotion. The resolution of such systems increases with the number of discrete states, 10 to 100 being sufficient for many applications. An MRI-guided needle positioning device for cancer treatments and a space exploration robot using hopping for locomotion are presented as examples of this concept.},
