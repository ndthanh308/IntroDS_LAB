@article{Lemay:1998wx,
	Abstract = {Steady-state charge transport via motion of charge-density waves (CDW's) requires conversion between collective CDW conduction and quasiparticle conduction in the vicinity of current injection contacts. The conversion occurs via phase slip, in which CDW amplitude defects form and move in the presence of CDW strain so as to remove or add CDW phase fronts in a process analogous to phase slip in superconductors and superfluids. We have determined the spatial distribution of phase slip for the TP1 CDW in NbSe3 by measuring the spatial variation of the CDW current density jc(x). As the current contacts are approached, jc(x) decreases and the normal current jn(x) due to quasiparticle flow increases. The size of the region near each contact where appreciable phase slip occurs is less than 40 $\mu$m for T near 120 K but grows to hundreds of micrometers at lower temperatures. The current and phase-slip profiles are asymmetric with respect to driving current direction, implying an asymmetry between phase front addition and removal. Analysis of these profiles yields the local relation between the phase-slip rate rps(x) and CDW strain $\varepsilon$(x). This relation is not unique, and for a given strain the phase-slip rate increases with increasing distance from the current electrode. These results are inconsistent with the predictions of models for phase slip via homogeneous defect nucleation, and provide evidence for amplitude defect motion. The presence of substantial amounts of phase slip at large distances from the current contacts explains the loss of coherence of the sliding CDW observed at lower temperatures, and suggests that predictions of phase-only models of CDW dynamics may be of very limited use in describing the sliding CDW in NbSe3.},

@article{Frohlich:1954fz,
	Abstract = {The one dimensional case of free electrons interacting with lattice displacements is solved by a self-consistent method. It is found that for a certain range of the interaction parameter a single sinusoidal lattice displacement is strongly excited in the lowest level of the system. Its wave-length is such as to create an energy gap in the single-electron energy spectrum with all states below it filled, and all above it empty. This periodic lattice displacement plays the role of an 'inner field' and leads to periodic fluctuation in the electronic density in such a way that the two stabilize each other. In an infinite medium described by a periodic boundary condition they are not fixed absolutely in space, but only relative to each other. Excitation of electrons across the gap leads to a decrease in both the electronic density fluctuations and the width of the gap. The whole system, electrons plus lattice displacements, can move through the lattice without being disturbed provided the velocity v is sufficiently small. The inertia of this system is equal to that of all electrons augmented by a term due to the lattice displacements. Elastic scattering of individual electrons which normally leads to the residual resistance is impossible if v is sufficiently small. The linear specific heat of normal electrons is eliminated and replaced by an exponential term.},

abstract = {Below a Peierls transition the coupled electron phonon collective mode plays an important role in the conductivity of one-dimensional metal models such as have been recently postulated for various organic compounds. Within the jellium model, or in an incommensurate situation, the mode frequency goes to zero for q → 0 and is responsible for the infinite conductivity first proposed by Fröhlich. Impurities, lattice commensurability and three dimensional ordering introduce a gap into the mode spectrum. The low frequency conductivity and a large dielectric constant are predicted. Similar effects are predicted for a spin density wave.
Zusammenfassung
Nach den neulich z.B. für verschiedenerlei organische Verbindungen aufgestellten eindimensionalen Metallmodellen spielt unterhalb eines Peierls-Übergangs die gekoppelte kollektive Elektron-Phonon-Ausbrietungsform bei der Leitfähigkeit eine wichtige Rolle. Die Formfrequenz geht bei q = 0 im Rahmen des Kolloidmodelles bzw. bei Fehlanpassung gegen 0 und ergibt die erstmals von Fröhlich angeregte unendliche Leitfähigkeit. Fremdatome, Gitteranpassung und räumliche Ordnung öffnen eine Lücke im Formspektrum. Die niederfrequente Leitfähigkeit sowie eine hohe Dielektrizitätskonstante werden vorausgesagt. Eine Spindichtewelle lässt ähnliche Effekte erwarten.}

First, nonlinear resistance is observed only after a well-defined threshold field is reached.

We interpret the threshold field as direct evidence of charge-density wave depinning and the noise as a result of charge-density wave motion.},

	Abstract = {A moving phase vortex at the end of a charge-density-wave conductor plays an essential role in the conversion of condensed carriers to free carriers. Under sliding conditions the periodic nucleation and destruction of these vortices generates the voltage oscillations (narrow-band noise) observed in these conductors. The role of free carriers in the noise generation is emphasized and the calculated ac voltage amplitude is compared with experiment. The exponential decay of the ac electric field away from the contact is determined by the ``phase-slip'' length which also determines the ``rigidity'' of the sliding current. A general discussion of the role of phase slips and dislocations in inhomogeneous geometries is given. Results from sample-length-dependence studies and thermal-gradient experiments are discussed. Competing theories for the noise based on interaction with random impurities are surveyed and their predictions compared with known experiments.},

Equations describing this process are derived and qualitatively investigated within the framework of a simple micro- scopicmodel. It is shown that the corresponding distance to the boundary can be macroscopically large, which explains the almost coherent nature of the oscillation spectrum.},

	Abstract = {The collective transport of charge density waves (CDW) converts into an ordinary current at the contacts with a normal metal. In the present work this conversion is proposed to proceed via the process of phase slippage (PS). The CDW in the quasi-one-dimensional system with a nested Fermi surface and impurities is described by the nonlinear differential equation derived earlier. This equation is solved numerically for semi-infinite samples, as well as for finite samples with both edges fixed. The analysis of solutions is carried out for electrical fields E and sample lengths L which are respectively one to two orders of magnitude larger and smaller than the actual experimental values. This leads to the following results : the PS solutions are one-periodic functions of time, with the distance of the PS centre from the fixed end behaving like E- 0.284 in the limit of small E. The coherent CDW transport in the finite samples occurs above the threshold field which varies as L-1.23. The pulses in the voltage generated by PS processes are also analysed. The results are in a good agreement with the experimental data for the length dependence of the threshold field and with some properties of the periodic noise in e.g. NbSe3 and TaS3.},

abstract = {It is shown that for micrometre-sized beams the X-ray diffraction from slits is a source of strong parasitic background, even for slits of high quality. In order to illustrate this effect, the coherent diffraction from rectangular slits has been studied in detail. A large number of interference fringes with strong visibility have been observed using a single set of slits made of polished cylinders. For very small apertures, asymmetrical slits generate asymmetrical patterns. This pattern is calculated from the theory of electromagnetic field propagation and compared with experiment in the far-field regime. The use of guard slits to remove Fraunhofer diffraction from the beam-defining slits is treated theoretically. Numerical simulations yield the optimum aperture of the guard slits with respect to the distance to the primary slits. Diffraction theory is shown to be essential to understand how to reduce the background-to-signal ratio in high-resolution experiments.}
