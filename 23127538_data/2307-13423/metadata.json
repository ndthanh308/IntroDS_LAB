  "abstract": "Self-supervised speech representations (SSSRs) have been successfully applied to a number of speech-processing tasks, e.g. as feature extractor for speech quality (SQ) prediction, which is, in turn, relevant for assessment and training speech enhancement systems for users with normal or impaired hearing. However, exact knowledge of why and how quality-related information is encoded well in such representations remains poorly understood. In this work, techniques for non-intrusive prediction of SQ ratings are extended to the prediction of intelligibility for hearing-impaired users. It is found that self-supervised representations are useful as input features to non-intrusive prediction models, achieving competitive performance to more complex systems. A detailed analysis of the performance depending on Clarity Prediction Challenge 1 listeners and enhancement systems indicates that more data might be needed to allow generalisation to unknown systems and (hearing-impaired) individuals",
