  "abstract": "Optically pumped magnetometers are ultra-sensitive devices, but this sensitivity can significantly degrade due to heading errors, whereby a change in the angle between the pumping laser and the magnetic field translates to a change in the magnetic field readout. We present a portable all-optical single-beam magnetometer with a reduced heading error due to a double-pass configuration. We analyze it both theoretically and experimentally. In addition to this significant improvement in performance, the increased interaction length of the laser with the cell enhances the signal. Overall, the new configuration enables better accuracy, as well as the reduction of the cell temperature, laser power, and further miniaturization of the sensing head. This work opens the door for a simple and robust sub-pT portable sensor in Earth field.",
