  year={It is a tricky task to compare magnetometers as there is no such thing as the best magnetometer - there is a magnetometer that is best suited for your needs. Having said that, we would like to add some more insights to our comparison. Our statement at the end of the first paragraph of Sec. IV, is based on a comparison of our all-optical Cs-based magnetometer to a similar cutting-edge commercial product (MFAM, Ref. 26) which has 10\,nT heading error while we measure 2\,nT. We also measure 4\,pT/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at 1\,Hz which is roughly the same as in the case of the MFAM. Another advantage of our system is that while the MFAM uses two separate lasers for pumping and probing, we use a single laser which is beneficial in terms of cost-of-goods, power budget, complexity, etc. Other top-level commercial magnetometers, such as GSMP-35u by GEM systems or QTFM by Quspin are not all optical. The GSMP has an outstanding sensitivity of 0.2\,pT at 1Hz, and better heading error due to the narrow spectral line of the K vapor. But it comes at the cost of a very low band-width (maximal 20\,Hz sample rate) and the lack of laser availability at the K frequency. Moreover, The GSMP also has polar and equatorial dead zones compared to the single equatorial dead zones in our Bell-bloom magnetometer. The QTFM of Quspin has similar performances to our magnetometer with 3\,pT sensitivity and 3\,nT heading error but requires a strong holding field during the pumping time, which adds complication to the setup compared to an all-optical Bell-Bloom magnetometer.}
