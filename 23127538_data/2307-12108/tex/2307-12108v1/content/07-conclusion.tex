\section{Summary \& Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}

\todo{This section could be removed and nothing would be lost. You would be better served using this space to fill our some of the other requested information.}

This paper explores currently-deployed \captchas via inspection of 200 popular websites and a series of user studies totalling $1,400$-participants.
For the research questions we posed at the outset, our results:
\begin{compactitem}
\item[\textbf{RQ1:}] show that there are significant differences in mean solving times between \captcha types.
\item[\textbf{RQ2:}] show that users' preference is not fully correlated with \captcha solving time.
\item[\textbf{RQ3:}] show that experimental context significantly influences \captcha solving times.
\item[\textbf{RQ4:}] confirm the previously-reported effects of age on solving time.
\item[\textbf{RQ5:}] confirm the high rates of abandonment due to \captcha-related tasks and identify that experimental context 
impacts abandonment.
\end{compactitem}

\noindent
We anticipate several directions for future work, including obtaining detailed measurements through a controlled user study, and further investigating the causes of abandonment.
