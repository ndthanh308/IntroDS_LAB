\section{Statistical Analysis of Solving Times}
\label{sec:eval_statistical}
To confirm the validity of our conclusions, we conducted several standard tests on the measured solving times.
We used the Holm-Bonferroni method to adjust for family-wise error in our statistical tests.
\begin{itemize}[itemsep=.2mm] 
\item First, we performed the \emph{Shapiro-Wilk normality test} with a null hypothesis that solving times adhere to a normal distribution.
For all \captcha types, results showed that we can reject the null hypothesis ($p < 0.001$).
\item Second, we ran a \emph{skewness test} with a null hypothesis that the skewness of the sample population is the same as that of a corresponding normal distribution.
For all \captcha types, results allowed us to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative: the distribution of solving times is skewed ($p < 0.001$).
\item Third, we used the \emph{tailedness test} with a null hypothesis that the kurtosis of the sample population is the same as that of a normal distribution.
Results showed that, for all except distorted text (moving), the samples were drawn from a population that has a heavy-tailed distribution ($p < 0.001$).
\end{itemize}
Since solving times are: (1) not normally distributed, and (2) heavy tailed, we selected the \emph{Brown Forsythe test} to compare the equality of variance between different types of \captchas.
Results show that these distributions do not have equal variance, thus confirming our observations in Section~\ref{sec:eval_solving_time}.
Given the result of the Brown Forsythe test, we selected the \emph{Kruskal-Wallis test} to test the equality of mean.
For two pairs: reCAPTCHA (easy image) - hCAPTCHA (easy) and reCAPTCHA (easy click) - (hard click), we didn't see any statistical evidence that the means differ.
For the remainder, this test showed strong statistical evidence that the means differ ($p < 0.05$ between masked and moving distorted text and $p < 0.001$ for all other combinations).
