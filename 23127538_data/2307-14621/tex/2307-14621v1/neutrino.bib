The most successful model with the dark energy equation of state w=w0+w1(1&minus;a2)/2 was studied in detail.

The cosmological counterpart is represented by dark radiation, i.e., any form of radiation present in the early Universe besides photons and standard (active) neutrinos. This short review provides a comprehensive overview of the two problems and of their connection. We review the status of neutrino oscillation anomalies, commenting on the most recent oscillation data and their mutual tensions, and we discuss the constraints from other terrestrial probes. We show the shortcomings of translating light sterile neutrinos in cosmology as additional thermalised relativistic species, produced by neutrino oscillations, and we detail alternative solutions, specifically focusing on neutrino nonstandard interactions, and on their link to the Hubble constant problem. The impact of a new force leading to dark radiation&ndash;dark matter interactions is also discussed in the realm of new physics in the dark sector.},

The redshift-distance measure is completely different for massive neutrinos as compared to electromagnetic radiation. The C&nu;B anisotropies in massive neutrinos grow in response to non-relativistic motion in gravitational potentials seeded by relatively high k-modes. Differences in the early phases of large-scale structure formation in warm dark matter (WDM) versus cold dark matter (CDM) cosmologies have an impact on the magnitude of the C&nu;B anisotropies for contributions to the angular power spectrum that peak at high k-modes. We take the examples of WDM consisting of 2, 3, or 7 keV sterile neutrinos and show that the C&nu;B anisotropies for 0.05 eV neutrinos drop off at high-l multipole moment in the angular power spectrum relative to CDM. At the same angular scales that one can observe baryonic acoustical oscillations in the CMB, the C&nu;B anisotropies begin to become sensitive to differences in WDM and CDM cosmologies. The precision measurement of high-l multipoles in the C&nu;B neutrino sky map is a potential possibility for the PTOLEMY experiment with thin film targets of spin-polarized atomic tritium superfluid that exhibit significant quantum liquid amplification for non-relativistic relic neutrino capture.},
