  "abstract": "Many micro-swimmers propel themselves by rotating micro-cylindrical organelles such as flagella or cilia. These cylindrical organelles almost never live in free space, yet their motions in a confining geometry can be counter-intuitive. For example, one of the intriguing yet classical results in this regard is that a rotating cylinder next to a plane wall does not generate any net force in Newtonian fluids and therefore does not translate. In this work, we employ analytical and numerical tools to investigate the motions of micro-cylinders under prescribed torques in a confining geometry. We show that a cylinder pair can form four non-trivial hydrodynamic bound states depending on the relative position within the confinement. Our analysis shows that the distinct states are the results of competing effects of the hydrodynamic interactions within the cylinder pair and between the active cylinders and the confinement.",
