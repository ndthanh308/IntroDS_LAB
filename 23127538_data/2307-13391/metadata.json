  "abstract": "We study homogenization problem for non-autonomous parabolic equations of the form $\\partial_t u=L(t)u$ with an integral convolution type operator $L(t)$ that has a non-symmetric jump kernel which is periodic in spatial variables and stationary random in time. We show that the homogenized equation is a SPDE with a finite dimensional multiplicative noise.",
