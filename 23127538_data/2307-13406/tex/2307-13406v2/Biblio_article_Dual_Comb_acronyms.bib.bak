  abstract = {Nitrous oxide N2O reduction is a big challenge due to high global warming potential of N2O. ({\textasciitilde}300 times higher compared with CO2). The best known catalysts, such as Rh/ceria, require relatively high temperatures for N2O decomposition. Herein, we report that Ru/ceria catalysts with low Ru loading of {\textasciitilde}0.25 wt\% efficiently catalyze low temperature N2O reduction by CO starting at 100 °C (full N2O conversion below 200 °C) under industrially relevant flow rates and gas concentrations. This remarkable performance stems from maintaining isolated Ru cations even on reduced ceria surface and, simultaneously, the propensity of Ru to affect ceria surface to form labile surface oxygen thereby creating large number of oxygen vacancies (Ce+3 cations) in the presence of CO. In contrast, for Rh/CeO2 catalysts with equivalent metal loading, the activity is much lower because atomically dispersed Rh sinters into metallic clusters at the onset reaction temperature ({\textasciitilde}200 °C): these clusters are much less effective than isolated single Ru ions, with lower Ce+3 concentration maintained on reduced Rh/CeO2 catalyst. Our study highlights the benefits of gaining molecular-level insight into the dynamic nature of catalytically active sites under reaction conditions for preparing catalysts containing low loading of precious metals with unsurpassed low temperature activity.},

              Increasing recognition of the extent to which nitrous oxide (N
              2
              O) contributes to climate change has resulted in greater demand to improve quantification of N
              2
              O emissions, identify emission sources and suggest mitigation options. Agriculture is by far the largest source and grasslands, occupying
              c
              . 0·22 of European agricultural land, are a major land-use within this sector. The application of mineral fertilizers to optimize pasture yields is a major source of N
              2
              O and with increasing pressure to increase agricultural productivity, options to quantify and reduce emissions whilst maintaining sufficient grassland for a given intensity of production are required. Identification of the source and extent of emissions will help to improve reporting in national inventories, with the most common approach using the IPCC emission factor (EF) default, where 0·01 of added nitrogen fertilizer is assumed to be emitted directly as N
              2
              O. The current experiment aimed to establish the suitability of applying this EF to fertilized Scottish grasslands and to identify variation in the EF depending on the application rate of ammonium nitrate (AN). Mitigation options to reduce N
              2
              O emissions were also investigated, including the use of urea fertilizer in place of AN, addition of a nitrification inhibitor dicyandiamide (DCD) and application of AN in smaller, more frequent doses. Nitrous oxide emissions were measured from a cut grassland in south-west Scotland from March 2011 to March 2012. Grass yield was also measured to establish the impact of mitigation options on grass production, along with soil and environmental variables to improve understanding of the controls on N
              2
              O emissions. A monotonic increase in annual cumulative N
              2
              O emissions was observed with increasing AN application rate. Emission factors ranging from 1·06–1·34\% were measured for AN application rates between 80 and 320 kg N/ha, with a mean of 1·19\%. A lack of any significant difference between these EFs indicates that use of a uniform EF is suitable over these application rates. The mean EF of 1·19\% exceeds the IPCC default 1\%, suggesting that use of the default value may underestimate emissions of AN-fertilizer-induced N
              2
              O loss from Scottish grasslands. The increase in emissions beyond an application rate of 320 kg N/ha produced an EF of 1·74\%, significantly different to that from lower application rates and much greater than the 1\% default. An EF of 0·89\% for urea fertilizer and 0·59\% for urea with DCD suggests that N
              2
              O quantification using the IPCC default EF will overestimate emissions for grasslands where these fertilizers are applied. Large rainfall shortly after fertilizer application appears to be the main trigger for N
              2
              O emissions, thus applicability of the 1\% EF could vary and depend on the weather conditions at the time of fertilizer application.},

	abstract = {Four long-running currents in laser technology met and merged in 1999–2000. Two of these were the quest toward a stable repetitive sequence of ever-shorter optical pulses and, on the other hand, the quest for the most time-stable, unvarying optical frequency possible. The marriage of UltraFast and UltraStable lasers was brokered mainly by two international teams and became exciting when a special “designer” microstructure optical fiber was shown to be nonlinear enough to produce “white light” from the femtosecond laser pulses, such that the output spectrum embraced a full optical octave. Then, for the first time, one could realize an optical frequency interval equal to the comb’s lowest frequency, and count out this interval as a multiple of the repetition rate of the femtosecond pulse laser. This “gear-box” connection between the radio frequency standard and any/all optical frequency standards came just as Sensitivity-Enhancing ideas were maturing. The four-way Union empowered an explosion of accurate frequency measurement results in the standards field and prepares the way for refined tests of some of our cherished physical principles, such as the time-stability of some of the basic numbers in physics (e.g., the “fine-structure” constant, the speed of light, certain atomic mass ratios etc.), and the equivalence of time-keeping by clocks based on different physics. The stable laser technology also allows time-synchronization between two independent femtosecond lasers so exact they can be made to appear as if the source were a single laser. By improving pump/probe experiments, one important application will be in bond-specific spatial scanning of biological samples. This next decade in optical physics should be a blast.},

	abstract = {Recently there has been a remarkable synergy between the technologies of precision laser stabilization and mode-locked ultrafast lasers. This has resulted in control of the frequency spectrum produced by mode-locked lasers, which consists of a regular comb of sharp lines. Thus such a controlled mode-locked laser is a “femtosecond optical frequency comb generator.” For a sufficiently broad comb, it is possible to determine the absolute frequencies of all of the comb lines. This ability has revolutionized optical frequency metrology and synthesis. It has also served as the basis for the recent demonstrations of atomic clocks that utilize an optical frequency transition. In addition, it is having an impact on time-domain applications, including synthesis of a single pulse from two independent lasers. In this Colloquium, we first review the frequency-domain description of a mode-locked laser and the connection between the pulse phase and the frequency spectrum in order to provide a basis for understanding how the absolute frequencies can be determined and controlled. Using this understanding, applications in optical frequency metrology and synthesis and optical atomic clocks are discussed. This is followed by a brief overview of how the comb technology is affecting and will affect time-domain experiments.},

	abstract = {A laser frequency comb is a broad spectrum composed of equidistant narrow lines. Initially invented for frequency metrology, such combs enable new approaches to spectroscopy over broad spectral bandwidths, of particular relevance to molecules. The performance of existing spectrometers — such as crossed dispersers employing, for example, virtual imaging phase array étalons, or Michelson-based Fourier transform interferometers — can be dramatically enhanced with optical frequency combs. A new class of instruments, such as dual-comb spectrometers without moving parts, enables fast and accurate measurements over broad spectral ranges. The direct self-calibration of the frequency scale of the spectra within the accuracy of an atomic clock and the negligible contribution of the instrumental line-shape will enable determinations of all spectral parameters with high accuracy for stringent comparisons with theories in atomic and molecular physics. Chip-scale frequency comb spectrometers promise integrated devices for real-time sensing in analytical chemistry and biomedicine. This Review gives a summary of the developments in the emerging and rapidly advancing field of atomic and molecular broadband spectroscopy with frequency combs.},

Underlying these recent advances has been the observation of temporal dissipative Kerr solitons in microresonators, which represent self-enforcing, stationary, and localized solutions of a damped, driven, and detuned nonlinear Schrödinger equation, which was first introduced to describe spatial self-organization phenomena. The generation of dissipative Kerr solitons provide a mechanism by which coherent optical combs with bandwidth exceeding one octave can be synthesized and have given rise to a host of phenomena, such as the Stokes soliton, soliton crystals, soliton switching, or dispersive waves. Soliton microcombs are compact, are compatible with wafer-scale processing, operate at low power, can operate with gigahertz to terahertz line spacing, and can enable the implementation of frequency combs in remote and mobile environments outside the laboratory environment, on Earth, airborne, or in outer space.},

The advantages of this spectrometer compared with the common FTIR include ease of operation (no moving parts), speed of acquisition (100 µs demonstrated), and not-yet-shown collimated long-distance propagation, diffraction-limited microscopic probing, and electronically controllable chemometric factoring. Extending time-domain frequency-comb spectroscopy to lower (terahertz) or higher (visible, ultraviolet) frequencies should be feasible.},

Here we propose a solution based on the combination of a frequency comb source and a fibre spectrometer, exploiting all-fibre technology. Our system allows for simultaneous measurement of 500 isolated comb lines over a span of 0.12 THz in a single acquisition; arbitrarily larger span are demonstrated (3,500 comb lines over 0.85 THz) by doing sequential acquisitions. The potential for precision measurements is proved by spectroscopy of acetylene at 1.53 μm. Being based on all-fibre technology, our system is inherently low-cost, lightweight and may lead to the development of a new class of broadband high-resolution spectrometers.},

	abstract = {Molecular fingerprinting using absorption spectroscopy is a powerful analytical method, particularly in the infrared, the region of intense spectral signatures. Fourier transform spectroscopy—the widely used and essential tool for broadband spectroscopy—enables the recording of multi-octave-spanning spectra, exhibiting 100 MHz resolution with an accuracy of 1 × 10−9 and 1 × 10−2 in wavenumber and intensity determination, respectively. Typically, 1 × 106 independent spectral elements may be measured simultaneously within a few hours, with only average sensitivity. Here, we show that by using laser frequency combs as the light source of Fourier transform spectroscopy it is possible to record well-resolved broadband absorption and dispersion spectra in a single experiment, from the beating signatures of neighbouring comb lines in the interferogram. The sensitivity is thus expected to increase by several orders of magnitude. Experimental proof of principle is here carried out on the 1.5-µm overtone bands of acetylene, spanning 80 nm with a resolution of 1.5 GHz. Consequently, without any optical modification, the performance of Fourier spectrometers may be drastically boosted.},

When the equidistant lines from a laser frequency comb are simultaneously injected into the cavity over a large spectral range, multiple trace gases may be identified1 within a few milliseconds. However, efficient analysis of the light transmitted through the cavity remains challenging. Here, a novel approach—cavity-enhanced, frequency-comb, Fourier-transform spectroscopy—fully overcomes this difficulty and enables measurement of ultrasensitive, broad-bandwidth, high-resolution spectra within a few tens of microseconds without any need for detector arrays, potentially from the terahertz to ultraviolet regions. Within a period of just 18 µs, we recorded the spectra of the ammonia 1.0 µm overtone bands comprising 1,500 spectral elements and spanning 20 nm, with a resolution of 4.5 GHz and a noise equivalent absorption at 1 s averaging of 1 × 10−10 cm−1 Hz−1/2, thus opening a route to time-resolved spectroscopy of rapidly evolving single events.},

	abstract = {Frequency combs are optical spectra composed of a set of discrete equally spaced lines. Such spectra can be generated by diverse sources such as mode-locked lasers, resonators, or electro-optic modulators. This last possibility has shown a growing interest in the recent years for its advantageous features in providing high repetition rates, intrinsic mutual coherence, or high power per comb lines. Moreover, applications of electro-optic modulator-based combs have flourished in fundamental physics, spectroscopy, or instrumental calibrations. In this paper, we present the most recent progresses made on frequency combs generated by electro-optic modulators, along with the applications where these combs have shown a particular interest.},
