  "abstract": "In this paper, we introduce an all-fibered dual-comb spectrometer based on a new design of highly nonlinear fiber to efficiently convert frequency combs from 1.55 micron to 2 micron We show that our spectrometer can be used to measure absorption profiles of rovibrational transitions of CO2 and N2O molecules, and especially their collisional self-broadening coefficients. The results show very good agreement with the HITRAN database and thus further measurements have been performed on a mixture CO2 /N2O to measure the broadening of the CO2 absorption lines resulting from the presence of N2O.",
