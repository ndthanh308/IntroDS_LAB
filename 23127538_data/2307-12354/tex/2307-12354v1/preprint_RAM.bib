abstract="Bringedal, CarinaWe present a phase-field model for single-phase flow and reactive transport where ions take part in mineral precipitation/dissolution reactions. The evolving interface between fluid and mineral is approximated by a diffuse interface, which is modeled using an Allen--Cahn equation. As the original Allen--Cahn equation is not conservative, we apply a reformulation ensuring conservation of the phase-field variable and address the sharp-interface limit of the reformulated model. This model is implemented using a finite volume scheme and the discrete conservation of the reformulated Allen--Cahn equation is shown. Numerical examples show how the discrete phase-field variable is conserved up to the chemical reaction.",

	abstract = { The macroscopic behaviour of air and water in porous media is often approximated using Richards' equation for the fluid saturation and pressure. This equation is parametrized by the hydraulic conductivity and water release curve. In this paper, we use homogenization to derive a general model for saturation and pressure in porous media based on an underlying periodic porous structure. Under an appropriate set of assumptions, i.e. constant gas pressure, this model is shown to reduce to the simpler form of Richards' equation. The starting point for this derivation is the Cahn?Hilliard phase field equation coupled with Stokes equations for fluid flow. This approach allows us, for the first time, to rigorously derive the water release curve and hydraulic conductivities through a series of cell problems. The method captures the hysteresis in the water release curve and ties the macroscopic properties of the porous media with the underlying geometrical and material properties. }

With the help of the multiple scale method with drift and our recently introduced splitting strategy for Ginzburg?Landau/Cahn?Hilliard-type equations (Schmuck et al 2012 Proc. R. Soc. A 468 3705?24), we rigorously derive an effective macroscopic phase field formulation under the assumption of periodic flow and a sufficiently large Péclet number. As for classical convection?diffusion problems, we obtain systematically diffusion?dispersion relations (including Taylor?Aris-dispersion). Our results also provide a convenient computational framework to macroscopically track interfaces in porous media. In view of the well-known versatility of phase field models, our study proposes a promising model for many engineering and scientific applications such as multiphase flows in porous media, microfluidics, and fuel cells.}

This upscaling is done for perforated/strongly heterogeneous domains. To the best knowledge of the authors, this seems to be the first attempt of upscaling the Cahn?Hilliard equation in such domains. The new homogenized equation should have a broad range of applicability owing to the well-known versatility of phase-field models. The additionally introduced feature of systematically and reliably accounting for confined geometries by homogenization allows for new modelling and numerical perspectives in both science and engineering. Our results are applied to wetting dynamics in porous media and to a single channel with strongly heterogeneous walls. }
