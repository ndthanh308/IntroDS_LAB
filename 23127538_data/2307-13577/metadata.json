  "abstract": "We investigate the stationary distribution of asymmetric and weakly asymmetric simple exclusion processes with open boundaries. We project the stationary distribution onto a subinterval, whose size is allowed to grow with the length of the underlying segment. Depending on the boundary parameters of the exclusion process, we provide conditions such that the stationary distribution projected onto a subinterval is close in total variation distance to a product measure.",
