  "abstract": "We present a solution to Liouville's equation for an ensemble of charged particles propagating in magnetic fields. The solution is presented using an expansion in spherical harmonics of the phase space density, allowing a direct interpretation of the distribution of arrival directions of cosmic rays. The results are found for chosen conditions of variability and source distributions. We show there are two conditions for an initially isotropic flux of particles to remain isotropic while traveling through a magnetic field: isotropy and homogeneity of the sources. In case isotropically-distributed sources inject particles continuously in time, a transient magnetic induced dipole will appear. This dipole will vanish if the system reaches a steady-state. The formalism is used to analyze the data measured by the Pierre Auger Observatory, contributing to the understanding of the dependence of the dipole amplitude with energy and predicting the energy in which the quadrupole signal should be measured.",
