	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Detailed simulations of the arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays are performed under the assumption of strong and structured extragalactic magnetic field (EGMF) models. Particles leaving Centaurus A, Virgo A, and Fornax A are propagated to Earth, and the simulated anisotropic signal is compared to the dipole and hotspots published by the Pierre Auger and Telescope Array Collaborations. The dominance of the EGMF structure in the arrival directions of events generated in local sources is shown. The absence of events from the Virgo A direction is related to the strong deviation caused by the EGMF. Evidence that these three sources contribute to an excess of events in the direction of the three detected hotspots is presented. Under the EGMF considered here, M82 is shown to have no contribution to the hotspot measured by the Telescope Array Observatory.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {To empirically calibrate the IR surface brightness fluctuation (SBF) distance scale and probe the properties of unresolved stellar populations, we measured fluctuations in 65 galaxies using NICMOS on the Hubble Space Telescope. The early-type galaxies in this sample include elliptical and S0 galaxies and spiral bulges in a variety of environments. Absolute fluctuation magnitudes in the F160W (1.6 μm) filter (F160W) were derived for each galaxy using previously measured I-band SBF and Cepheid variable star distances. F160W SBFs can be used to measure distances to early-type galaxies with a relative accuracy of ~10\%, provided that the galaxy color is known to ~0.035 mag or better. Near-IR fluctuations can also reveal the properties of the most luminous stellar populations in galaxies. Comparison of F160W fluctuation magnitudes and optical colors to stellar population model predictions suggests that bluer elliptical and S0 galaxies have significantly younger populations than redder ones and may also be more metal-rich. There are no galaxies in this sample with fluctuation magnitudes consistent with old, metal-poor (t > 5 Gyr, [Fe/H] < -0.7) stellar population models. Composite stellar population models imply that bright fluctuations in the bluer galaxies may be the result of an episode of recent star formation in a fraction of the total mass of a galaxy. Age estimates from the F160W fluctuation magnitudes are consistent with those measured using the Hβ Balmer-line index. The two types of measurements make use of completely different techniques and are sensitive to stars in different evolutionary phases. Both techniques reveal the presence of intermediate-age stars in the early-type galaxies of this sample.}

Dust and complex morphological structures are common. Dust is detected in 42\% of galaxies brighter than BT = 12.15 mag, while kiloparsec-scale stellar disk, bars, and nuclear stellar disks are seen in 60\% of galaxies with intermediate luminosity. Isophotal parameters are derived typically within 8 kpc from the center for the brightest galaxies, and 1.5 kpc for the faintest systems, with a resolution of 7 pc. For most galaxies, the surface brightness profiles are well described by a Sérsic model with index n that increases steadily with the galaxy luminosity; only for 8 of the 10 brightest galaxies are the inner profiles (typically within 100 pc of the center) lower than expected based on an extrapolation of the outer Sérsic model, and are better described by a single power-law function. Contrary to previous claims, we find no evidence in support of a strong bimodal behavior of the logarithmic slope of the inner surface brightness profile, γ; in particular the γ distribution for galaxies that do not show evidence of multiple morphological components is unimodal across the entire magnitude range spanned by the ACSVCS galaxies. Although the brightest galaxies have shallow inner profiles, the shallowest profiles are found in faint dwarf systems. The widely adopted separation of early-type galaxies between "core" and "power-law" types is questioned based on the present study.}

The 7C Redshift Survey is a low-frequency (151 MHz) selected sample with a flux density limit about 25 times fainter than the 3CRR sample. By combining these samples, we can for the first time distinguish whether the correlations present are controlled by 151-MHz radio luminosity L151 or redshift z. We find unequivocal evidence that the dominant effect is a strong positive correlation between narrow-line luminosity LNLR and L151, of the form . Correlations of LNLR with redshift or radio properties, such as linear size or 151-MHz (rest frame) spectral index, are either much weaker or absent. We use simple assumptions to estimate the total bulk kinetic power Q of the jets in FR II radio sources, and confirm the underlying proportionality between jet power and narrow-line luminosity first discussed by Rawlings \\&amp; Saunders. We make the assumption that the main energy input to the narrow-line region is photoionization by the quasar accretion disc, and relate Q to the disc luminosity, Qphot. We find that 0.05≲QQphot≲1, so that the jet power is within about an order of magnitude of the accretion disc luminosity. Values of QQphot|1 require the volume filling factor η of the synchrotron-emitting material to be of the order of unity, and in addition require one or more of the following: (i) an important contribution to the energy budget from protons; (ii) a large reservoir of mildly relativistic electrons; and (iii) a substantial departure from the minimum-energy condition in the lobe material. The most powerful radio sources are accreting at rates close to the Eddington limit of supermassive black holes (MBH≳109 M⊙), whilst lower power sources are accreting at sub-Eddington rates.}",

    abstract = "{The kinetic power of radio jets is a quantity of fundamental importance to studies of the AGN feedback process and radio galaxy physics. A widely used proxy for jet power is the extended radio luminosity. A number of empirical methods have been used to calibrate a scaling relationship between jet power (Q) and radio luminosity (L) of the form log (Q) = βL log (L) + C. The regression slope has typically been found to be βL ∼ 0.7–0.8. Here we show that the previously reported scaling relations are strongly affected by the confounding variable, distance. We find that in a sample of FRI X-ray cavity systems, after accounting for the mutual distance dependence, the jet power and radio luminosity are only weakly correlated, with slope βL ≈ 0.3: significantly flatter than previously reported. We also find that in previously used samples of high-power sources, no evidence for an intrinsic correlation is present when the effect of distance is accounted for. Using a simple model we show that βL is expected to be significantly lower in samples of FRI radio galaxies than it is for FRIIs, due to the differing dynamics for these two classes of radio source. For FRI X-ray cavity systems the model predicts βL(FRI) ≳ 0.5 in contrast to FRII radio galaxies, for which βL(FRII) ≳ 0.8. We discuss the implications of our finding for studies of radio mode feedback, and radio galaxy physics.}",

We propose a scenario in which turbulent-flow motions are induced via the cascade of the vorticity generated at cosmological shocks during the formation of the large-scale structure. The turbulence in turn amplifies weak seed magnetic fields of any origin. Supercomputer simulations show that the turbulence is subsonic inside clusters and groups of galaxies, whereas it is transonic or mildly supersonic in filaments. Based on a turbulence dynamo model, we then estimated that the average magnetic field strength would be a few microgauss (μG) inside clusters and groups, approximately 0.1 μG around clusters and groups, and approximately 10 nanogauss in filaments. Our model presents a physical mechanism that transfers the gravitational energy to the turbulence and magnetic field energies in the large-scale structure of the universe.},

	abstract = {We present a detailed analytical study of the propagation of ultra-high-energy (UHE) particles in extragalactic magnetic fields. The crucial parameter that affects the diffuse spectrum is the separation between sources. In the case of a uniform distribution of sources with a separation between them much smaller than all characteristic propagation lengths, the diffuse spectrum of UHE particles has a universal form, independent of the mode of propagation. This statement has the status of theorem. The proof is obtained using the particle number conservation during propagation and also using the kinetic equation for the propagation of UHE particles. This theorem can be also proved with the help of the diffusion equation. In particular, it is shown numerically how the diffuse fluxes converge to this universal spectrum, when the separation between sources diminishes. We study also the analytic solution of the diffusion equation in weak and strong magnetic fields with energy losses taken into account. In the case of strong magnetic fields and for a separation between sources large enough, the GZK cutoff can practically disappear, as it has been found early in numerical simulations. In practice, however, the source luminosities required are too large for this possibility.}

	abstract = {The universe is magnetized on all scales probed so far. On the largest scales, galaxies and galaxy clusters host magnetic fields at the micro Gauss level coherent on scales up to ten kpc. Recent observational evidence suggests that even the intergalactic medium in voids could host a weak  ∼  10−16 Gauss magnetic field, coherent on Mpc scales. An intriguing possibility is that these observed magnetic fields are a relic from the early universe, albeit one which has been subsequently amplified and maintained by a dynamo in collapsed objects. We review here the origin, evolution and signatures of primordial magnetic fields. After a brief summary of magnetohydrodynamics in the expanding universe, we turn to magnetic field generation during inflation and phase transitions. We trace the linear and nonlinear evolution of the generated primordial fields through the radiation era, including viscous effects. Sensitive observational signatures of primordial magnetic fields on the cosmic microwave background, including current constraints from Planck, are discussed. After recombination, primordial magnetic fields could strongly influence structure formation, especially on dwarf galaxy scales. The resulting signatures on reionization, the redshifted 21 cm line, weak lensing and the Lyman-α forest are outlined. Constraints from radio and γ-ray astronomy are summarized. Astrophysical batteries and the role of dynamos in reshaping the primordial field are briefly considered. The review ends with some final thoughts on primordial magnetic fields.}

The use of this absorption-free catalogue, complete also along the Galactic plane, allows us to use all the Auger events. The correlation is significant, being 86.2 per cent for the entire sample of H i galaxies, and becoming 99 per cent when considering the richest galaxies in H i content or 98 per cent with those lying between 40 and 55 Mpc. We interpret this result as the evidence that spiral galaxies are the hosts of the producers of ultra-high energy cosmic rays and we briefly discuss the classical (i.e. energetic and distant) long gamma-ray burst (GRBs), short GRBs, as well as newly born or late-flaring magnetars as possible sources of the Auger events. With the caveat that these events are still very few, and the theoretical uncertainties are conspicuous, we found that newly born magnetars are the best candidates. If so, they could also be associated with sub-energetic, spectrally soft, nearby, long GRBs. We finally discuss why there is a clustering of Auger events in the direction on the radio galaxy Cen A and an absence of events in the direction of the radio galaxy M87.}",

	abstract = {Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope measurements of spectra, variability timescales, and maximum photon energies give lower limits to the apparent jet powers and, through γγ opacity arguments, the bulk Lorentz factors of relativistic jets. The maximum cosmic-ray particle energy is limited by these two quantities in Fermi acceleration scenarios. Recent data are used to constrain the maximum energies of cosmic-ray protons and Fe nuclei accelerated in colliding shells of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and blazars. The Fermi results indicate that Fe rather than protons are more likely to be accelerated to ultra-high energies in active galactic nuclei (AGNs), whereas powerful GRBs can accelerate both protons and Fe to ≳1020 eV. Emissivity of nonthermal radiation from radio galaxies and blazars is estimated from the First Fermi AGN Catalog, and shown to favor BL Lac objects and FR1 radio galaxies over flat spectrum radio quasars, FR2 radio galaxies, and long-duration GRBs as the sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.}

	abstract = {The chemical composition of the ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays serves as an important clue to their origin. Recent measurements of the elongation rates by the Pierre Auger Observatory hint at the possible presence of heavy or intermediate-mass nuclei in the UHE cosmic rays. Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and hypernovae have been suggested as possible sources of the UHE cosmic rays. Here we derive constraints on the physical conditions under which UHE heavy nuclei, if they are accelerated in these sources, can survive in their intense photon fields. We find that in the GRB external shock and hypernova scenarios, UHE nuclei can easily survive photodisintegration. In the GRB internal shock scenario, UHE nuclei can also survive, provided the dissipation radius and/or the bulk Lorentz factor of the relativistic outflow are relatively large, or if the low-energy self-absorption break in the photon spectrum of the prompt emission occurs above several keV. In internal shocks and in the other scenarios, intermediate-mass UHE nuclei have a higher probability of survival against photodisintegration than UHE heavy nuclei such as Fe.}

We present a comprehensive study of the size of angular deflections, dispersion in the arrival probability distributions, multiplicity in the images of arrival on Earth, variance in field transparency, and influence of the turbulent field components. To remain restricted to ballistic deflections, a cosmic nucleus with energy E and charge Z should have a rigidity above E/Z=6 EV. In view of the differences resulting from the two field parameterizations as a measure of current knowledge in the galactic field, this rigidity threshold may have to be increased. For a point source search with E/Z ≥ 60 EV, field uncertainties increase the required signal events for discovery moderately for sources in the northern and southern regions, but substantially for sources near the galactic disk.}

In this case, the nearest active galaxy Centaurus A might be the source of the most energetic particles ever detected on Earth.

We expect detections corresponding to particles with energies up to ∼ 2.2 × 1021 eV and an arrival direction of (l ≈ 310°, b ≈ 20°) in galactic coordinates. The future Southern Hemisphere Pierre Auger Observatory might provide a decisive test for extragalactic models of the origin of the ultra—high energy cosmic rays.}

abstract="The Ultra High Energy Cosmic Ray (UHECR) and Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) fields are very similar in many respects. Both have gone through a burst of activity in source modeling, both have a history of ``repeaters'' and, for both, the discovery of isotropy in arrival directions mean a fundamental change of current views and ideas. As in the case of gamma ray bursts (GRB), one can expect that the next significant step in our understanding of the UHECR problem will come when some source is finally identified as data accumulates from the new large exposure experiments under construction. However, UHECR are most likely charged particles, and so there is probably not such a thing as an easily identifiable optical counterpart, as there turned out to be with GRBs. Intervening galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields can affect propagation at energies of hundreds of EeV in a very significant way. This coupling means that both, cosmic magnetic fields and UHECR will have to be tackled together. UHECR will be, at the same time, the object of study and an invaluable diagnostic tool for magnetic fields inside the 100 Mpc sphere defined by the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cut-off. The prospects for the future will be discussed.",

In this scenario, the intergalactic magnetic field has a strong (in units of microgauss) regular component spanning tens of megaparsecs but localized in sheets and filaments, while the vast voids in between are almost free of magnetic field. If true, this could have important consequences on the propagation of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays and severely affect our capacity for doing astronomy with charged particles.

	abstract = {We have searched for intermediate-scale anisotropy in the arrival directions of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays with energies above 57 EeV in the northern sky using data collected over a 5 yr period by the surface detector of the Telescope Array experiment. We report on a cluster of events that we call the hotspot, found by oversampling using 20° radius circles. The hotspot has a Li-Ma statistical significance of 5.1σ, and is centered at R.A. = 146.°7, decl. = 43.°2. The position of the hotspot is about 19° off of the supergalactic plane. The probability of a cluster of events of 5.1σ significance, appearing by chance in an isotropic cosmic-ray sky, is estimated to be 3.7 × 10−4 (3.4σ).}

	abstract = {We evaluate the validity of leading models of the Galactic magnetic field for predicting UHECR deflections from Cen A. The Jansson-Farrar 2012 GMF model (JF12), which includes striated and random components as well as an out-of-plane contribution to the regular field not considered in other models, gives by far the best fit globally to all-sky data including the WMAP7 22 GHz synchrotron emission maps for Q, U & I and ≈ 40,000 extragalactic Rotation Measures (RMs). Here we test the models specifically in the Cen A region, using 160 well-measured RMs and the Polarized Intensity from WMAP, nearby but outside the Cen A radio lobes. The JF12 model predictions are in excellent agreement with the observations, justifying confidence in its predictions for deflections of UHECRs from Cen A. We find that up to six of the 69 Auger events above 55 EeV are consistent with originating in Cen A and being deflected ⩽ 18°; in this case three are protons and three have Z = 2−4. Others of the 13 events within 18° must have another origin. In order for a random extragalactic magnetic field between Cen A and the Milky Way to appreciably alter these conclusions, its strength would have to be ≳80 nG — far larger than normally imagined.}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {We present high angular resolution X-ray images and spectra from two Chandra AXAF CCD Imaging Spectrometer (ACIS-I) observations of the X-ray jet in the nearby radio galaxy Cen A. We find that the X-ray emission from the jet is composed of a low surface brightness diffuse component extending continuously from within at least 60 pc of the active nucleus into the northeast radio lobe 4 kpc from the nucleus, along with 31 discrete compact knots, most of which are extended at the resolution of our observation. We find that there are small but significant differences between the X-ray and radio morphologies of the inner jet at the arcsecond level, making it unlikely that a single, spatially coincident population of ultrarelativistic electrons is responsible for the emission in both energy regimes. We suggest that the X-ray knots of the inner jet are indeed the sites of particle acceleration and shocks and that the X-ray and radio knot offsets are caused by a combination of particle diffusion and energy loss. These offsets may be a common feature of all jets in radio galaxies, or at least jets in FR I galaxies, and may be fundamental to the physics of such jets. They are best observed in Cen A because the source is so close. Even though the X-ray and radio knots are offset in position and there are variations of more than a factor of 3 in the ratio of X-ray to radio flux density in the inner jet, the radio to X-ray two-point spectral indices at the X-ray knots are not unusually flat and are consistent with those observed in other X-ray jets seen in FR I galaxies such as M87 and 3C 66B. We find the width of the jet in the X-ray bandpass to be narrower than that measured in the radio along most of its length. The X-ray spectra of several regions of the jet are well fitted by absorbed power-law models with photon indices ~2.2-2.5, although the spectrum of one bright knot located ~1 kpc from the nucleus (knot B) is harder (photon index = 2.0).}

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {Chandra HRC observations are investigated for evidence of proper motion and brightness changes in the X-ray jet of the nearby radio galaxy M87. Using images spanning 5 yr, proper motion is measured in the X-ray knot HST-1, with a superluminal apparent speed of 6.3 ± 0.4c, or 24.1 ± 1.6 mas yr−1, and in Knot D, with a speed of 2.4 ± 0.6c. Upper limits are placed on the speeds of the remaining jet features. The X-ray knot speeds are in excellent agreement with existing measurements in the radio, optical, and ultraviolet. Comparing the X-ray results with images from the Hubble Space Telescope indicates that the X-ray and optical/UV emitting regions co-move. The X-ray knots also vary by up to 73\% in brightness, whereas there is no evidence of brightness changes in the optical/UV. Using the synchrotron cooling models, we determine lower limits on magnetic field strengths of ∼ 420 μG and ∼ 230 μG for HST-1 and Knot A, respectively, consistent with estimates of the equipartition fields. Together, these results lend strong support to the synchrotron cooling model for Knot HST-1, which requires that its superluminal motion reflects the speed of the relativistic bulk flow in the jet.}

	abstract = {Ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) are atomic nuclei from space with vastly higher energies than any other particles ever observed. Their origin and chemical composition remain a mystery. As we show here, the large and intermediate angular scale anisotropies observed by the Pierre Auger Observatory are a powerful tool for understanding the origin of UHECRs. Without specifying any particular production mechanism but only postulating that the source distribution follows the matter distribution of the local universe, a good accounting of the magnitude, direction, and energy dependence of the dipole anisotropy at energies above 8 × 1018 eV is obtained after taking into account the impact of energy losses during propagation (the “GZK horizon”), diffusion in the extragalactic magnetic field, and deflections in the Galactic magnetic field (GMF). This is a major step toward the long-standing hope of using UHECR anisotropies to constrain UHECR composition and magnetic fields. The observed dipole anisotropy is incompatible with a pure proton composition in this scenario. With a more accurate treatment of energy losses, it should be possible to further constrain the cosmic-ray composition and properties of the extragalactic magnetic field, self-consistently improve the GMF model, and potentially expose individual UHECR sources.}

	title = {Testing a Reported Correlation between Arrival Directions of Ultra-high-energy Cosmic Rays and a Flux Pattern from nearby Starburst Galaxies using Telescope Array Data},
	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
	abstract = {The Pierre Auger Collaboration (Auger) recently reported a correlation between the arrival directions of cosmic rays with energies above 39 EeV and the flux pattern of 23 nearby starburst galaxies (SBGs). In this Letter, we tested the same hypothesis using cosmic rays detected by the Telescope Array experiment (TA) in the 9 yr period from 2008 May to 2017 May. Unlike the Auger analysis, we did not optimize the parameter values but kept them fixed to the best-fit values found by Auger, namely 9.7\% for the anisotropic fraction of cosmic rays assumed to originate from the SBGs in the list and 12.°9 for the angular scale of the correlations. The energy threshold that we adopted is 43 EeV, corresponding to 39 EeV in Auger when taking into account the energy-scale difference between two experiments. We find that the TA data is compatible with isotropy to within 1.1σ and with the Auger result to within 1.4σ, meaning that it is not capable to discriminate between these two hypotheses.}

We include a Galactic magnetic field model on top of a random extragalactic magnetic field description to determine the level of UHECR deflections expected from an ensemble of source positions. Besides deflections in magnetic fields, we also take into account energy losses with background photon fields as well as spectrum and composition measurements by the PAO.

Larger source densities lead to more isotropic background and consequently allow for weaker extragalactic magnetic fields. However, the acceleration of UHECR by such abundant sources is more challenging to motivate. Too large source densities and extragalactic magnetic field strengths, on the other hand, are also disfavoured as that decreases the expected level of anisotropy.

The Pierre Auger Collaboration has recently reported that anisotropy in the arrival directions of cosmic rays is correlated with several types of extragalactic objects. If these cosmic rays originate from these objects, they imply a limit on the EGMF strength of B &lt; 0.7– G for coherence lengths λB &lt; 100 Mpc and B &lt; 0.7–2.2 × 10−10 G at larger scales. This is comparable to existing upper limits at λB = 1 Mpc, and improves on them by a factor of 4–12 at larger scales. The principal source of uncertainty in our results is the unknown cosmic-ray composition.}

The appearance of image pairs is related to the existence of critical curves in the magnification maps, which divide regions in the sky where the images have opposite parities. The results are pictorially illustrated as the stretching and folding of a `sheet' describing the sky seen on Earth. Making use of the most energetic AGASA events we emphasize the need to know the cosmic ray composition and the structure of the magnetic field when attempting to do detailed cosmic ray astronomy.}

title = {A New Method for Calculating Arrival Distribution of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays above 1019 eV with Modifications by the Galactic Magnetic Field},
journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {We present a new method for calculating arrival distribution of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), including modifications by the Galactic magnetic field. We perform numerical simulations of UHE antiprotons, which are injected isotropically at the Earth, in the Galaxy and record the directions of velocities at the Earth and outside the Galaxy for all of the trajectories. We then select some of them so that the resultant mapping of the velocity directions outside the Galaxy of the selected trajectories corresponds to a given source location scenario, applying Liouville's theorem. We also consider energy-loss processes of UHE protons in the intergalactic space. Applying this method to the source location scenario that is adopted in our recent study and can explain the Akeno Giant Air Shower Array (AGASA) observation above 4 × 1019 eV, we calculate the arrival distribution of UHECRs, including lower energy (E &gt; 1019 eV) ones. We find that our source model can reproduce the large-scale isotropy and the small-scale anisotropy on UHECR arrival distribution above 1019 eV observed by the AGASA. We also demonstrate the UHECR arrival distribution above 1019 eV, with the event number expected by future experiments in the next few years. The interesting feature of the resultant arrival distribution is the arrangement of the clustered events in the order of their energies, reflecting the directions of the Galactic magnetic field. This is also pointed out by Alvarez-Muniz, Engel, &amp; Stanev. This feature will allow us to obtain some kind of information about the composition of UHECRs and the magnetic field with increasing amount of data.}

abstract = {The large scale pattern in the arrival directions  of extragalactic cosmic rays that reach the Earth is different  from that of the flux arriving to the halo of the Galaxy as a result of the propagation through the galactic magnetic field. Two different effects are  relevant in this process: deflections of trajectories and (de)acceleration  by the electric field component due to the galactic rotation. The deflection of the cosmic ray  trajectories makes the flux intensity arriving to the halo from some  direction to appear reaching the Earth from another direction.  This applies to any intrinsic anisotropy in the  extragalactic distribution or, even in the absence of intrinsic anisotropies,  to the dipolar Compton-Getting anisotropy induced when the observer is moving  with respect to the cosmic rays rest frame. For an observer moving with the solar system, cosmic rays traveling through  far away regions of the Galaxy also experience an electric force  coming from the relative motion (due to the rotation of the Galaxy) of the local system in which the field can be considered as being purely magnetic.  This produces small changes in the particles momentum that can originate large scale anisotropies even for an isotropic  extragalactic flux.}

The data reveal an O(0.1\%) deficit from north galactic directions that peaks at 10 TeV and then evolves with the energy, together with other anisotropies at smaller angular scales. Using the Boltzmann equation, we derive expressions for the CR flux that fit these features. The anisotropies depend on the local interstellar magnetic field , on the average galactic field  in our vicinity, and on correlations between fluctuating quantities. We show that the initial dipole anisotropy along  can be modulated by changes in the global CR flow, and that a variation in the dipole direction would imply a given radius of coherence for the local . We also show that small- and medium-scale anisotropies may appear when the full-sky anisotropy finds a field configuration acting as a magnetic lens.}

abstract = {Cosmic-ray anisotropy has been observed in a wide energy range and at different angular scales by a variety of experiments over the past decade. However, no comprehensive or satisfactory explanation has been put forth to date. The arrival distribution of cosmic rays at Earth is the convolution of the distribution of their sources and of the effects of geometry and properties of the magnetic field through which particles propagate. It is generally believed that the anisotropy topology at the largest angular scale is adiabatically shaped by diffusion in the structured interstellar magnetic field. On the contrary, the medium- and small-scale angular structure could be an effect of nondiffusive propagation of cosmic rays in perturbed magnetic fields. In particular, a possible explanation for the observed small-scale anisotropy observed at the TeV energy scale may be the effect of particle propagation in turbulent magnetized plasmas. We perform numerical integration of test particle trajectories in low-β compressible magnetohydrodynamic turbulence to study how the cosmic rays’ arrival direction distribution is perturbed when they stream along the local turbulent magnetic field. We utilize Liouville’s theorem for obtaining the anisotropy at Earth and provide the theoretical framework for the application of the theorem in the specific case of cosmic-ray arrival distribution. In this work, we discuss the effects on the anisotropy arising from propagation in this inhomogeneous and turbulent interstellar magnetic field.}

For this purpose, we used a magnetic field model of the heliosphere and performed direct numerical calculations of particle trajectories. Unlike earlier papers testing the idea, we did not employ time-reversible techniques that are based on Liouville’s theorem. We showed numerically that for scattering by the heliosphere, the conditions of Liouville’s theorem are not satisfied, and the adiabatic approximation and time-reversibility of the particle trajectories are not valid. Our results indicate sensitivity to the magnetic structure of the heliospheric magnetic field, and we expect that this will be useful for probing this structure in future research.}

abstract = {A consequence of Liouville's theorem indicates that the recently observed large scale anisotropy in the arrival direction of Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs) cannot be produced from an isotropic extragalactic flux, thus some anisotropy already needs to be present outside our Galaxy. But in this case, the observed spectrum and composition of UHECRs differ from the one outside of the Milky Way, due to the suppression or the amplification of the UHECR flux from certain directions by the Galactic magnetic field. In this work, we investigate this effect for the case of a dipole and a quadrupole anisotropy, respectively, for the widely-used JF12 and PT11 magnetic field models. We investigate bounds on the maximal amplitude of the observed anisotropy and the maximal charge number of UHECRs. Furthermore, the flux modification is discussed in the light of the recent Auger results about the dipolar anisotropy and the mass composition. We find that this effect yields a modification of the observed flux of up to ∼ 25\% for the investigated magnetic field model and the observed dipole, in particular for a heavy chemical composition of UHECRs as suggested by Auger data interpreted assuming the `Sibyll2.3c' or the `EPOS-LHC' model of hadronic interactions in air showers.}

journal = {The Astrophysical Journal},
abstract = {Anisotropy in the arrival direction distribution of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) produced by powerful sources is numerically evaluated. We show that nondetection of significant anisotropy at  eV at present and in future experiments imposes general upper limits on UHECR proton luminosity of steady sources as a function of source redshifts. The upper limits constrain the existence of typical steady  eV UHECR sources in the local universe and limit their local density to  Mpc  assuming average intergalactic magnetic fields less than  G. This isotropy, being stronger than that measured at the highest energies, may indicate the transient generation of UHECRs. Our calculations are applied for extreme high-frequency-peaked BL Lacertae objects 1ES 0229+200, 1ES 1101–232, and 1ES 0347–121, to test the UHECR-induced cascade model, in which beamed UHECR protons generate TeV radiation in transit from sources. While the magnetic-field structure surrounding the sources affects the required absolute cosmic-ray luminosity of the blazars, the magnetic-field structure surrounding the Milky Way directly affects the observed anisotropy. If these magnetic fields are weak enough, significant UHECR anisotropy from these blazars is detectable by the Pierre Auger Observatory unless the maximum energy of UHECR protons is below 1019 eV. Furthermore, if these are the sources of UHECRs above 1019 eV, a local magnetic structure surrounding the Milky Way is needed to explain the observed isotropy at  eV, which may be incompatible with large magnetic structures around all galaxies for the UHECR-induced cascade model to work with reasonable jet powers.}

abstract = {The arrival directions of Galactic cosmic rays are highly isotropic. This is expected from the presence of turbulent magnetic fields in our Galactic environment that repeatedly scatter charged cosmic rays during propagation. However, various cosmic ray observatories have identified weak anisotropies of various angular sizes and with relative intensities of up to a level of 1 part in 1000. Whereas large-scale anisotropies are generally predicted by standard diffusion models, the appearance of small-scale anisotropies down to an angular size of 10° is surprising. In this review, we summarize the current experimental situation for both the large-scale and small-scale anisotropies. We address some of the issues in comparing different experimental results and remaining questions in interpreting the observed large-scale anisotropies. We then review the standard diffusive picture and its difficulty in producing the small-scale anisotropies. Having set the stage, we review the various ideas and models put forward for explaining the small-scale anisotropies.}

Here we present the range of cosmogenic neutrino fluxes in the dip-model which are compatible with a recent determination of the extragalactic very high energy (VHE) gamma-ray diffuse background derived from 2.5 years of Fermi/LAT data. We show that the largest fluxes predicted in the dip model would be detectable by IceCube in about 10 years of observation and are within the reach of a few years of observation with the ARA project. In the incomplete UHECR model in which protons are assumed to dominate only above 1019 eV, the cosmogenic neutrino fluxes could be a factor of 2 or 3 larger. Any fraction of heavier nuclei in the UHECR at these energies would reduce the maximum cosmogenic neutrino fluxes.  We also consider here special evolution models in which the UHECR sources are assumed to have the same evolution of either the star formation rate (SFR), or the gamma-ray burst (GRB) rate, or the active galactic nuclei (AGN) rate in the Universe and found that the last two are disfavored (and in the dip model rejected) by the new VHE gamma-ray background.}

journal = {Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics},
abstract = {This paper proposes and discusses a test of the chemical composition of ultra-high energy cosmic rays that relies on the anisotropy patterns measured as a function of energy. In particular, we show that if one records an anisotropy signal produced by heavy nuclei of charge Z above an energy Ethr, one should record an even stronger (possibly much stronger) anisotropy at energies &gt;Ethr/Z due to the proton component that is expected to be associated with the sources of the heavy nuclei. This conclusion remains robust with respect to the parameters characterizing the sources and it does not depend at all on the modelling of astrophysical magnetic fields. As a concrete example, we apply this test to the most recent data of the Pierre Auger Observatory. Assuming that the anisotropy reported above 55 EeV is not a statistical accident, and that no significant anisotropy has been observed at energies ≲10 EeV, we show that the apparent clustering toward Cen A cannot be attributed to heavy nuclei. Similar conclusions are drawn regarding the apparent excess correlation with nearby active galactic nuclei. We then discuss a robust lower bound to the magnetic luminosity that a source must possess in order to be able to accelerate particles of charge Z up to 100 EeV, LB ≳ 1045 Z−2 erg/s. Using this bound in conjunction with the above conclusions, we argue that the current PAO data does not support the model of cosmic ray origin in active radio-quiet or even radio-loud galaxies. Finally, we demonstrate that the apparent clustering in the direction of Cen A can be explained by the contribution of the last few gamma-ray bursts or magnetars in the host galaxy thanks to the scattering of the cosmic rays on the magnetized lobes.}
