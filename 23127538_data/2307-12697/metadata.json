  "abstract": "We measure cross sections of proton-induced reactions on tin up to energies of 18 MeV using the stacked-foil activation technique, and report first experimental values for 114Sn(p,α)111In, {^{120}}Sn(p,α)117gIn, and 114Sn(p,x)113Sn reactions. Measured cross sections have been compared to existing experimental values and numerical calculations based on Talys1.95. Our data are in good agreement with all previous experiments, and also with Talys1.95 results except for 120Sn(p,α)117m,gIn reactions where the numerical calculations are shifted to higher energies. We also measure isomeric cross section ratios for 117m,gIn and 120m,gSb pairs as functions of the incident proton energy.",
