In this paper, we propose \textit{Pseudo-Clustering Semi-SFL}, a novel system for Semi-SFL that enhances the model's performance under data heterogeneity while ensuring computational and communication efficiency. 
Our system is built on the SFL framework and performs clustering regularization on the PS, resulting in improved convergence speed and accuracy compared to existing methods. 
Furthermore, we adapts the \InvReg frequency in order to favor both the \srvUp and \locReg stages, guided by our theoretical analysis on model convergence.
Our experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our system, with which achieving state-of-the-art performance on the SVHN, CIFAR-10, and IMAGE-100 datasets. 
% This work contributes to the development of federated learning with few labels and provides a valuable avenue for future research in this field, particularly when limited resources are available.
