  "abstract": "We provide necessary and sufficient conditions on the density $W:\\mathbb R^d\\times\\mathbb R ^d\\to\\mathbb R$ in order to ensure the sequential weak* lower semicontinuity of the functional $J: W^{1,\\infty}(I;\\mathbb R^d)\\to \\mathbb R$, defined as \\begin{align*} J(u):=ess\\,sup_{I\\times I}W(u'(x), u'(y)), \\end{align*} when $I$ is an open and bounded interval of $\\mathbb R$. We also show that, when $d=1$, the lower semicontinuous envelope of $I$ in general can be obtained by replacing $W$ by its separately level convex envelope.",
