\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
I designed corruption-robust algorithms for the Lipschitz contextual search problem. I presented the \emph{sanity check} technique and demonstrated its effectiveness in designing robust algorithms. There are several open problems for future research. First, in the algorithm I propose for pricing loss, the sanity check schedule is fixed upfront. Can the learner design an adaptive sanity check schedule for the pricing loss? Second, this work assumes the learner has knowledge of the Lipschitz constant $L$. Can the learner design efficient no-regret algorithms without knowledge of $L$?
