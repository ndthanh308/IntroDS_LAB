\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
In this work, I design corruption-robust algorithms for the Lipschitz contextual search problem. I present the \emph{agnostic checking} technique and demonstrate its effectiveness in designing corruption-robust algorithms. There are several open problems for future research. First, in the algorithm I propose for pricing loss, the schedule for agnostic checks is fixed upfront. Can the learner design an adaptive checking schedule for the pricing loss? Second, this work assumes the learner has knowledge of the Lipschitz constant $L$. Can the learner design efficient no-regret algorithms without knowledge of $L$?
