\section{Introduction}

This is where the content of your paper goes.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Use the \textbackslash documentclass[anon,12pt]\{alt2024\} option during submission process -- this automatically hides the author names listed under \textbackslash altauthor.

  \item Submissions should NOT include author names or other identifying information in the main text or appendix. To the extent possible, you should avoid including directly identifying information in the text. You should still include all relevant references, discussion, and scientific content, even if this might provide significant hints as to the author identity. But you should generally refer to your own prior work in third person. Do not include acknowledgments in the submission. They can be added in the camera-ready version of accepted papers. 
  
  \item Use \textbackslash documentclass[final,12pt]\{alt2024\} only during camera-ready submission.
\end{itemize}
