  "abstract": "The smeared Dp-brane is constructed by having the black Dp-brane uniformly smeared over several transverse directions. After integrating the spherical directions and the smeared directions, the smeared Dp-brane turns out to be a Chamblin-Reall model with one background scalar field. Within the framework of the fluid/gravity correspondence, we not only prove the equivalence between the smeared Dp-brane and the compactified Dp-brane by explicitly calculating the 7 dynamical second-order transport coefficients of their dual relativistic fluids, but also revisit the Correlated Stability Conjecture for the smeared Dp-brane via the fluid/gravity correspondence.",
