  "abstract": "Using the framework of pastures and foundations of matroids developed by Baker-Lorscheid, we give algorithms to: (i) compute the foundation of a matroid, and (ii) compute all morphisms between two pastures. Together, these provide an efficient method of solving many questions of interest in matroid representations, including orientability, non-representability, and computing all representations of a matroid over a finite field.",
