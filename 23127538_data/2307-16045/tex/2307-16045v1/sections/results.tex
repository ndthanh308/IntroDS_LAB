The final Romanian academic word list consists of 673 lemmas with their corresponding part of speech tags. The list comprises 332 nouns, 167 adjectives, 157 verbs, and 17 adverbs. We automatically translated into Romanian the words from the AVL developed for English \cite{gardner2014new} that contains 3015 words. We found that 381 words in our list are in the original AVL. There are some cases of academic words found in our Romanian academic list and in the AVL for English for which the automatic translation fails to provide the correct match. For example, the noun “adoption" from AVL was translated as “adopție", which is not in the Ro-AWL, but the word “adoptare" is an academic word from Ro-AWL with the same meaning. The fact that we found more than half of the Ro-AWL in the original AVL, even though in some cases the translation fails to capture the correct meaning of the words, makes us confident that the measures used are reliable for building a Romanian academic word list.

In line with previous works \cite{gardner2014new,coxhead2000new,carlund2012academic}, to demonstrate the viability of the newly developed academic word list, we measured the coverage of the Ro-AWL in two corpora: the academic corpus EXPRES and in the general corpora ROMBAC. The academic words from our list cover 15.25\% of the EXPRES corpus and 6.73\% of ROMBAC. In line with the English AVL results, Ro-AWL has a higher coverage in the academic corpus and a lower coverage in the general corpus. Regarding the coverage in EXPRES, we show the coverage of academic words categorised by their part-of-speech tags in Table \ref{tab:coverage}. The coverage of the Romanian academic word list varies in the four domains. The coverage is 17.75\% for the Economics sub-corpora, 11.82\% for Linguistics, 17.03\% for Information Technology and 13.17\% for Political Sciences.
