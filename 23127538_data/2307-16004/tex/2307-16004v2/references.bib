Standard geometric models of atomic packing can account for the polymeric and inorganic glasses without requiring changes in interatomic separations (bond lengths). By contrast, the relatively small difference in density between crystalline and glassy metals (and metallic alloys) implies variations in interatomic separations due to merging orbitals giving rise to reduced atomic volumes. To test this hypothesis, quantum density functional theory computations were carried out on ordered and irregular clusters of aluminum. The results point to decreasing interatomic distances with decreasing coordination, from which one can deduce that the geometrical method of random hard sphere packing significantly underestimates the densities of amorphous metallic alloys.}",

This also allows us to study the local viscosity and free volume when the polymer film is put under an external stress. We find that the film does not flow homogeneously but undergoes shear banding that is visible as a spatially varying free volume and viscosity.}",

The second‐order transition temperature, viscosity‐temperature coefficient, and specific volume all change rapidly with increasing molecular weight toward asymptotic limits which are practically reached at M≅30,000. Empirical expressions are presented relating these properties to molecular weight and temperature. In each case the dependence on molecular weight is expressed as a simple function of M̄n−1. These observations are interpreted and correlated on the basis of the hypothesis that the local configurational order in a liquid polymer is disturbed by the introduction of end groups to a degree that is proportional to their number. The second‐order transition does not represent an isoviscous state. The internal local configurational structure appears to be equivalent, and independent of temperature, in all polystyrenes below their second‐order transition temperatures.}",

Colloids are small enough that thermal energy drives their dynamics and ensures equilibration with the suspending fluid; they are also large enough that their positions and motions can be measured precisely using optical methods, such as light scattering and laser-scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy. Colloidal suspensions are a powerful model system for the study of other phenomena in condensed matter physics, where the collective phase behavior of the solid particles mimics that of other condensed systems. We review three classes of interacting colloidal particles, crystals, glasses, and gels, each of which represents fascinating properties of colloidal particles as well as a model for more general types of materials and their behavior. }

These formulas represent a remarkable improvement on previous analytic and semianalytic formulas for the interaction, while maintaining an excellent degree of analytic simplicity. Furthermore, a detailed derivation of the interaction free energy between two dissimilar spheres in the linear Debye-Huckel approximation is presented that is valid for all κh, where κ is the Debye screening parameter and h is the distance of closest approach between the spheres. In doing so, it is demonstrated that the well-known Hogg-Healy-Fuersteneau (HHF) formula, which is valid only in the small κh regime, may be trivially modified to extend its range of applicability to all κh.}

abstract  ="In addition to the repulsive and attractive interaction forces described by Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) theory{,} many charged colloid systems are stabilized by non-DLVO contributions stemming from specific material attributes. Here{,} we investigate non-DLVO contributions to the stability of polymer colloids stemming from the intra-particle glass transition temperature (Tg). Flash nanoprecipitation is used to fabricate nanoparticles (NPs) from a library of polymers and dispersion stability is studied in the presence of both hydrophilic and hydrophobic salts. When adding KCl{,} stability undergoes a discontinuous decrease as Tg increases above room temperature{,} indicating greater stability of rubbery NPs over glassy NPs. Glassy NPs are also found to interact strongly with hydrophobic phosphonium cations (PR4+){,} yielding charge inversion and intermediate aggregation while rubbery NPs resist ion adsorption. Differences in the lifetime of ionic structuration within mobile surface layers is presented as a potential mechanism underlying the observed phenomenon."}

Frequently we experience the existance of adhesive forces between small particles. It seems natural to ascribe this adhesion for a large part to London-v.d. Waals forces. To obtain general information concerning their order of magnitude the London-v. d. Waals interaction between two spherical particles is computed as a function of the diameters and the distance separating them. A table is calculated which enables numerical application of the formulae derived. Besides approximations are added, which may be used when the distance between the particles is small. In a separate section it is investigated how the results must be modified, when both particles are immersed in a liquid. Here we are led to the important conclusion that even in that case London-v. d. Waals forces generally cause an attraction.}
