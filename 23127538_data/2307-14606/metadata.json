  "abstract": "The precision of phase estimation with interferometers can be greatly enhanced using non-classical quantum states, and the SU(11) interferometer is an elegant scheme, which generates two-mode squeezed state internally and also amplifies the signal. It has been shown in [Phys. Rev. A {\\bf 95}, 063843 (2017)] that the photon-number measurement can achieve the Heisenberg limit, but only for estimating a small phase shift. We relax the constraint on the phase size by considering two adaptive protocols: one also uses the photon-number measurement with a specially tuned sequence of feedback phase; the other implements the yet-to-be-realised optimal measurement but without fine tuning.",
