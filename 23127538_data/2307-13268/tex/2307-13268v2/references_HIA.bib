	abstract = {Within the resistive magnetohydrodynamic model, high-Lundquist number reconnection layers are unstable to the plasmoid instability, leading to a turbulent evolution where the reconnection rate can be independent of the underlying resistivity. However, the physical relevance of these results remains questionable for many applications. First, the reconnection electric field is often well above the runaway limit, implying that collisional resistivity is invalid. Furthermore, both theory and simulations suggest that plasmoid formation may rapidly induce a transition to kinetic scales, due to the formation of thin current sheets. Here, this problem is studied for the first time using a first-principles kinetic simulation with a Fokker-Planck collision operator in 3D. The low-{$\beta$} reconnecting current layer thins rapidly due to Joule heating before the onset of the oblique plasmoid instability. Linear growth rates for standard (ky = 0) tearing modes agree with semicollisional boundary layer theory, but the angular spectrum of oblique ({\textbar}ky{\textbar}\&gt;0) modes is significantly narrower than predicted. In the nonlinear regime, flux-ropes formed by the instability undergo complex interactions as they are advected and rotated by the reconnection outflow jets, leading to a turbulent state with stochastic magnetic field. In a manner similar to previous 2D results, super-Dreicer fields induce a transition to kinetic reconnection in thin current layers that form between flux-ropes. These results may be testable within new laboratory experiments.},

We found that after electrons are first pre-accelerated during the linear growth of reconnection, they become additionally accelerated in the course of the nonlinear stage of 3D guide-field magnetic reconnection. This additional acceleration is due to the filamentation of electric and magnetic fields caused by streaming instabilities. In addition to enhanced parallel electric fields, the filamentation leads to additional curvature-driven electron acceleration in the guide-field direction. As a result, part of the accelerated electron spectra becomes a power law with a spectral index of {$\sim-$}1.6 near the X-line. This second stage of acceleration due to nonlinear reconnection is relevant for the production of energetic electrons in, e.g., thin current sheets of stellar coronae.},

Using kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we explore the impact of three-dimensional reconnection dynamics on the efficiency of particle acceleration. In two-dimensional systems, Alfv{\'e}nic outflows expel energetic electrons into flux ropes where they become trapped and disconnected from acceleration regions. However, in three-dimensional systems these flux ropes develop an axial structure that enables particles to leak out and return to acceleration regions. This requires a finite guide field so that particles may move quickly along the flux rope axis. We show that greatest energetic electron production occurs when the guide field is of the same order as the reconnecting component: large enough to facilitate strong transport, but not so large as to throttle the dominant Fermi mechanism responsible for efficient electron acceleration. This suggests a natural explanation for the envelope of electron acceleration during the impulsive phase of eruptive flares.},

The plasma parameters are selected to model MMS magnetopause diffusion region crossings with guide fields of 0.1, 0.4, and 1 of the reconnecting magnetosheath field. In each case, strong drift-wave fluctuations are observed in the lower-hybrid frequency range at the steep density gradient across the magnetospheric separatrix. These fluctuations give rise to cross-field electron particle transport. In addition, this turbulent mixing leads to significantly enhanced electron parallel heating in comparison to 2D simulations. We study three different methods of quantifying the anomalous dissipation produced by the drift fluctuations, based on spatial averaging, temporal averaging, and temporal averaging followed by integrating along magnetic field lines. A comparison of different methods reveals complications in identifying and measuring the anomalous dissipation. Nevertheless, the anomalous dissipation from short wavelength drift fluctuations appears weak for each case, and the reconnection rates observed in 3D are nearly the same as in 2D models. The 3D simulations feature a number of interesting new features that are consistent with recent MMS observations, including cold beams of magnetosheath electrons that penetrate into the hotter magnetospheric inflow, the related observation of decreasing temperature in regions of increasing total density, and an effective turbulent diffusion coefficient that agrees with predictions from quasi-linear theory.},

	abstract = {We revisit the theory of stochastic heating of ions and investigate its phase-space signatures in kinetic turbulence of relevance to low-{$\beta$} portions of the solar wind. In particular, we retain a full scale-dependent approach in our treatment, and we explicitly consider the case in which electric-field fluctuations can be described by a generalized Ohm's law that includes Hall and thermoelectric effects. These two electric-field terms provide the dominant contributions to stochastic ion heating when the ion-Larmor scale is much smaller than the ion skin depth, {$\rho$} i {$\ll$} d i, which is the case at {$\beta$} {$\ll$} 1. Employing well-known spectral scaling laws for Alfv{\'e}n-wave and kinetic-Alfv{\'e}n-wave turbulent fluctuations, we obtain scaling relations characterizing the field-perpendicular particle-energization rate and energy diffusion coefficient associated with stochastic heating in these two regimes. Phase-space signatures of ion heating are then investigated using three-dimensional hybrid-kinetic simulations of continuously driven Alfv{\'e}nic turbulence at low {$\beta$} (namely, {$\beta$} i = {$\beta$} e = 0.3 and {$\beta$} i = {$\beta$} e = 1/9). In these simulations, energization of ions parallel to the magnetic field is subdominant compared to its perpendicular counterpart (Q {$\parallel$},i {$\ll$} Q {$\perp$},i), and the fraction of turbulent energy that goes into ion heating is {$\approx$}75\% at {$\beta$} i = 0.3 and {$\approx$}40\% at {$\beta$} i {$\simeq$} 0.1. The phase-space signatures of ion energization are consistent with Landau-resonant collisionless damping and a ({$\beta$}-dependent) combination of ion-cyclotron and stochastic heating. We demonstrate good agreement between our scale-dependent theory and various signatures associated with the stochastic portion of the heating. We discuss briefly the effect of intermittency on stochastic heating and the implications of our work for the interpretation of stochastic heating in solar-wind spacecraft data.},

We focus on plasmas in which {$\beta$} {$\lessequivlnt$} 1, where {$\beta$} is the ratio of plasma pressure to magnetic pressure. As in previous studies, we find that when the turbulence amplitude exceeds a certain threshold, an ion's orbit becomes chaotic. The ion then interacts stochastically with the time-varying electrostatic potential, and the ion's energy undergoes a random walk. Using phenomenological arguments, we derive an analytic expression for the rates at which different ion species are heated, which we test by simulating test particles interacting with a spectrum of randomly phased AWs and KAWs. We find that the stochastic heating rate depends sensitively on the quantity {$\epsilon$} = {$\delta$}v{$\rho$}/v{$\perp$}, where v{$\perp$} (v{$\parallel$}) is the component of the ion velocity perpendicular (parallel) to the background magnetic field B0, and {$\delta$}v{$\rho$} ({$\delta$}B{$\rho$}) is the rms amplitude of the velocity (magnetic-field) fluctuations at the gyroradius scale. In the case of thermal protons, when {$\epsilon$} {$\ll$} {$\epsilon$}crit, where {$\epsilon$}crit is a constant, a proton's magnetic moment is nearly conserved and stochastic heating is extremely weak. However, when {$\epsilon>\epsilon$}crit, the proton heating rate exceeds half the cascade power that would be present in strong balanced KAW turbulence with the same value of {$\delta$}v{$\rho$}, and magnetic-moment conservation is violated even when {$\omega$} {$\ll$} {$\Omega$}. For the random-phase waves in our test-particle simulations, {$\epsilon$}crit = 0.19. For protons in low-{$\beta$} plasmas, {$\epsilon$} {$\simeq$} {$\beta-$}1/2{$\delta$}B{$\rho$}/B0, and {$\epsilon$} can exceed {$\epsilon$}crit even when {$\delta$}B{$\rho$}/B0 {$\ll$} {$\epsilon$}crit. The heating is anisotropic, increasing v2{$\perp$} much more than v2{$\parallel$} when {$\beta$} {$\ll$} 1. (In contrast, at {$\beta$} {$\greaterequivlnt$} 1 Landau damping and transit-time damping of KAWs lead to strong parallel heating of protons.) At comparable temperatures, alpha particles and minor ions have larger values of {$\epsilon$} than protons and are heated more efficiently as a result. We discuss the implications of our results for ion heating in coronal holes and the solar wind.},

Although it is well known that magnetic reconnection and turbulence are coupled and transport energy from system-size scales to subproton scales, the details of the energy distribution and energy dissipation channels remain poorly understood. Especially, the energy transfer and transport associated with 3D small-scale reconnection that occurs as a consequence of a turbulent cascade is unknown. We use an explicit fully kinetic particle-in-cell code to simulate 3D small-scale magnetic reconnection events forming in anisotropic and decaying Alfv{\'e}nic turbulence. We identify a highly dynamic and asymmetric reconnection event that involves two reconnecting flux ropes. We use a two-fluid approach based on the Boltzmann equation to study the spatial energy transfer associated with the reconnection event and compare the power density terms in the two-fluid energy equations with standard energy-based damping, heating, and dissipation proxies. Our findings suggest that the electron bulk flow transports thermal energy density more efficiently than kinetic energy density. Moreover, in our turbulent reconnection event, the energy density transfer is dominated by plasma compression. This is consistent with turbulent current sheets and turbulent reconnection events, but not with laminar reconnection.},

The process is not direct acceleration by the coherent, laminar reconnection-generated electric field. Rather, reconnection causes turbulent outflows where energy exchange is dominated by a highly non-Gaussian distribution of fluctuations.

Special attention is paid to the spectral transition that occurs near the ion-Larmor scale and to the origins of preferential perpendicular ion heating and of nonthermal wings in the parallel distribution function. Several novel diagnostics are used to show that the ion heating rate increases as the kinetic-Alfv{\'e}n-wave fluctuations, which comprise the majority of the sub-ion-Larmor turbulent cascade, attain near-ion-cyclotron frequencies. We find that {$\approx$}75\%{\textendash}80\% of the cascade energy goes into heating the ions, broadly consistent with the near-Earth solar wind. This heating is accompanied by clear velocity-space signatures in the particle energization rates and the distribution functions, including a flattened core in the perpendicular-velocity distribution and non-Maxwellian wings in the parallel-velocity distribution. The latter are attributed to transit-time damping and the pitch-angle scattering of perpendicularly heated particles into the parallel direction. Accompanying these features is a steepening of the spectral index of sub-ion-Larmor magnetic-field fluctuations beyond the canonical -2.8, as field energy is transferred to thermal energy. These predictions may be tested by measurements in the near-Earth solar wind.},

Two different ion beta () regimes are considered: 0.1 and 0.5. For , good agreement between the GK and FK models is found at scales ranging from the ion to the electron gyroradius, thus providing firm evidence for a kinetic Alfv{\'e}n cascade scenario. In the same range, the HK model produces shallower spectral slopes, presumably due to the lack of electron Landau damping. For , a detailed analysis of spectral ratios reveals a slight disagreement between the GK and FK descriptions at kinetic scales, even though kinetic Alfv{\'e}n fluctuations likely still play a significant role. The discrepancy can be traced back to scales above the ion gyroradius, where the FK and HK results seem to suggest the presence of fast magnetosonic and ion Bernstein modes in both plasma beta regimes, but with a more notable deviation from GK in the low-beta case. The identified practical limits and strengths of reduced-kinetic approximations, compared here against the FK model on a case-by-case basis, may provide valuable insight into the main kinetic effects at play in turbulent collisionless plasmas, such as the solar wind.},

Since particle collisions are practically negligible, the solar wind is typically not in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium. Such a complex system must be described through self-consistent and fully nonlinear models, taking into account its multi-species composition and turbulence. We use a kinetic hybrid Vlasov{\textendash}Maxwell numerical code to reproduce the turbulent energy cascade down to ion kinetic scales, in typical conditions of the uncontaminated solar wind plasma, with the aim of exploring the differential kinetic dynamics of the dominant ion species, namely protons and alpha particles. We show that the response of different species to the fluctuating electromagnetic fields is different. In particular, a significant differential heating of alphas with respect to protons is observed. Interestingly, the preferential heating process occurs in spatial regions nearby the peaks of ion vorticity and where strong deviations from thermodynamic equilibrium are recovered. Moreover, by feeding a simulator of a top-hat ion spectrometer with the output of the kinetic simulations, we show that measurements by such spectrometer planned on board the Turbulence Heating ObserveR (THOR mission), a candidate for the next M4 space mission of the European Space Agency, can provide detailed three-dimensional ion velocity distributions, highlighting important non-Maxwellian features.

  abstract = {3He-rich solar energetic particles (SEPs) are believed to be accelerated in solar flares or jets by a mechanism that depends on the ion charge-to-mass (Q/M) ratio. It implies that the flare plasma characteristics (e.g., temperature) may be effective in determining the elemental abundances of 3He-rich SEPs. This study examines the relation between the suprathermal ({$\lessequivlnt$}0.2 MeV nucleon-1) abundances of the He\textendash Fe ions measured on the Advanced Composition Explorer and temperature in the solar sources for 24 3He-rich SEP events in the period 2010\textendash 2015. The differential emission measure technique is applied to derive the temperature of the source regions from the extreme ultraviolet imaging observations on the Solar Dynamics Observatory. The obtained temperature distribution peaks at 2.0\textendash 2.5 MK that is surprisingly consistent with earlier findings based on in situ elemental abundance or charge state measurements. We have found a significant anticorrelation between 3He/4He ratio and solar source temperature with a coefficient -0.6. It is most likely caused by non-charge-stripping processes, as both isotopes would be fully ionized in the inferred temperature range. This study shows that the elemental ratios 4He/O, N/O, Ne/O, Si/O, S/O, Ca/O, Fe/O generally behave with temperature as expected from abundance enhancement calculations at ionization equilibrium. The C and Mg, the two species with small changes in the Q/M ratio in the obtained temperature range, show no such behavior with temperature and could be influenced by similar processes as for the 3He/4He ratio.},
