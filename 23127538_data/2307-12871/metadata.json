  "abstract": "Effective power flow modeling critically affects the ability to efficiently solve large-scale grid optimization problems, especially those with topology-related decision variables. In this work, we put forth a generative modeling approach to obtain a piecewise linear (PWL) approximation of AC power flow by training a simple neural network model from actual data samples. By using the ReLU activation, the NN models can produce a PWL mapping from the input voltage magnitudes and angles to the output power flow and injection. Our proposed generative PWL model uniquely accounts for the nonlinear and topology-related couplings of power flow models, and thus it can greatly improve the accuracy and consistency of output power variables. Most importantly, it enables to reformulate the nonlinear power flow and line status-related constraints into mixed-integer linear ones, such that one can efficiently solve grid topology optimization tasks like the AC optimal transmission switching (OTS) problem. Numerical tests using the IEEE 14- and 118-bus test systems have demonstrated the modeling accuracy of the proposed PWL approximation using a generative approach, as well as its ability in enabling competitive OTS solutions at very low computation order.",
