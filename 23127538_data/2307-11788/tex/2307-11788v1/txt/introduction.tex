Predicting the price development of assets is one of the core problems in finance. As the price of any asset is determined by supply and demand, the individual valuation of each buyer and seller constitutes essential information for the task of price prediction. With the advent of social media platforms like twitter, such data became freely available at massive scale. This catalyzed the application of methods from natural language processing (NLP) to allow for automated analysis of investor's sentiments~\cite{8455771}. While the field of NLP has achieved tremendous success in recent history~\cite{info14040242} -- even showing substantial evidence to pass the Turing test~\cite{10.1093/mind/LIX.236.433, Nath2022} -- the compute used to achieve these advancements is enormous~\cite{10.1145/3458817.3476209}.

A particularly promising novel approach to NLP and computational finance in terms of hardware requirements is quantum computing, as it has been shown to need less training data in machine learning \cite{caro2022generalization} and allows for the efficient incorporation of grammatical structure in NLP ~\cite{app12115651, Stamatopoulos2022towardsquantum}. Motivated by recent positive experimental results of two quantum NLP (QNLP) methods, namely the Quantum-Enhanced Long Short-Term Memory (QLSTM) neural networks~\cite{9747369, DiSipio.2022} and the quantum native DisCoCat (Distributional Compositional Categorical) based QNLP~\cite{Meichanetzidis2020, 10.1613/jair.1.14329, Martinez.2022}, we evaluate their applicability to sentiment analysis on financial datasets beyond existing proofs of concept.

%QLSTMs are the quantum analog of classical LSTMs~\cite{9747369}, which are a specific type of recurrent neural network (RNN), that learn temporal dynamics and capture time dependencies by managing a hidden and cell state over multiple time steps inside a LSTM cell.~\cite{10.1162/neco.1997.9.8.1735}. While (Q)LSTMs have to learn grammatical dependencies in sentences, the DisCoCat framework directly operates on a grammatical decomposition of a given sentence~\cite{coecke2010mathematical,EPTCS221.8}. %this sentence might be unnecessary

This work encompasses the following contributions:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A comprehensive guide for the application of QLSTMs and DisCoCat.
    \item Introducing a novel approach to generating datasets for DisCoCat that enables automated data generation with sufficient grammatical structure using ChatGPT.
    \item A case study comparing the applicability of two state-of-the-art QNLP methods in a finance application.
\end{itemize}

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Sec.~\ref{sec:background} discusses theoretic preliminaries on QLSTMs and DisCoCat. Sec.~\ref{sec:methodology} shows how both methods can be applied to solve the given task of sentiment analysis. Sec.~\ref{sec:evaluation} contains the evaluation and subsequent comparison of both approaches on synthetic datasets. Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes the findings.
