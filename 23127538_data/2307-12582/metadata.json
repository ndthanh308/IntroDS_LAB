  "abstract": "We investigate pseudopolynomial-time algorithms for Bounded Knapsack and Bounded Subset Sum. Recent years have seen a growing interest in settling their fine-grained complexity with respect to various parameters. For Bounded Knapsack, the number of items $n$ and the maximum item weight $w_{\\max}$ are two of the most natural parameters that have been studied extensively in the literature. The previous best running time in terms of $n$ and $w_{\\max}$ is $O(n + w^3_{\\max})$ [Polak, Rohwedder, Wegrzycki '21]. There is a conditional lower bound of $O((n + w_{\\max})^{2-o(1)})$ based on $(\\min,+)$-convolution hypothesis [Cygan, Mucha, Wegrzycki, Wlodarczyk '17]. We narrow the gap significantly by proposing a $\\tilde{O}(n + w^{12/5}_{\\max})$-time algorithm. Note that in the regime where $w_{\\max} \\approx n$, our algorithm runs in $\\tilde{O}(n^{12/5})$ time, while all the previous algorithms require $Ω(n^3)$ time in the worst case.\n  For Bounded Subset Sum, we give two algorithms running in $\\tilde{O}(nw_{\\max})$ and $\\tilde{O}(n + w^{3/2}_{\\max})$ time, respectively. These results match the currently best running time for 0-1 Subset Sum. Prior to our work, the best running times (in terms of $n$ and $w_{\\max}$) for Bounded Subset Sum is $\\tilde{O}(n + w^{5/3}_{\\max})$ [Polak, Rohwedder, Wegrzycki '21] and $\\tilde{O}(n + μ_{\\max}^{1/2}w_{\\max}^{3/2})$ [implied by Bringmann '19 and Bringmann, Wellnitz '21], where $μ_{\\max}$ refers to the maximum multiplicity of item weights.",
