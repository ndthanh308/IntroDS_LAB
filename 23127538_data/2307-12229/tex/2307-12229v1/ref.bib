abstract = {Limited contrast, along with speckle and acoustic noise, can reduce the diagnostic value of echocardiographic images. This study introduces dynamic histogram-based intensity mapping (DHBIM), a novel approach employing temporal variations in the cumulative histograms of cardiac ultrasound images to contrast enhance the imaged structures. DHBIM is then combined with spatial compounding to compensate for noise and speckle. The proposed techniques are quantitatively assessed (32 clinical data sets) employing (i) standard image quality measures and (ii) the repeatability of routine clinical measurements, such as chamber diameter and wall thickness. DHBIM introduces a mean increase of 120.9% in tissue/chamber detectability, improving the overall repeatability of clinical measurements by 17%. The integrated approach of DHBIM followed by spatial compounding provides the best overall enhancement of image quality and diagnostic value, consistently outperforming the individual approaches and achieving a 401.4% average increase in tissue/chamber detectability with an associated 24.3% improvement in the overall repeatability of clinical measurements.}

abstract="Neural Networks (NNs) have provided state-of-the-art results for many challenging machine learning tasks such as detection, regression and classification across the domains of computer vision, speech recognition and natural language processing. Despite their success, they are often implemented in a frequentist scheme, meaning they are unable to reason about uncertainty in their predictions. This article introduces Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) and the seminal research regarding their implementation. Different approximate inference methods are compared, and used to highlight where future research can improve on current methods.",

abstract="Recent methods in multiple landmark detection based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) reach high accuracy and improve traditional clinical workflow. However, the vulnerability of CNNs to adversarial-example attacks can be easily exploited to break classification and segmentation tasks. This paper is the first to study how fragile a CNN-based model on multiple landmark detection to adversarial perturbations. Specifically, we propose a novel Adaptive Targeted Iterative FGSM (ATI-FGSM) attack against the state-of-the-art models in multiple landmark detection. The attacker can use ATI-FGSM to precisely control the model predictions of arbitrarily selected landmarks, while keeping other stationary landmarks still, by adding imperceptible perturbations to the original image. A comprehensive evaluation on a public dataset for cephalometric landmark detection demonstrates that the adversarial examples generated by ATI-FGSM break the CNN-based network more effectively and efficiently, compared with the original Iterative FGSM attack. Our work reveals serious threats to patients' health. Furthermore, we discuss the limitations of our method and provide potential defense directions, by investigating the coupling effect of nearby landmarks, i.e., a major source of divergence in our experiments.
