	abstract = {In recent years, the use of integrated technologies for applications in the field of quantum information processing and communications has made great progress. The resulting devices feature valuable characteristics such as scalability, reproducibility, low cost and interconnectivity, and have the potential to revolutionize our computation and communication practices in the future, much in the way that electronic integrated circuits have drastically transformed our information processing capacities since the last century. Among the multiple applications of integrated quantum technologies, this review will focus on typical components of quantum communication systems and on overall integrated system operation characteristics. We are interested in particular in the use of photonic integration platforms for developing devices necessary in quantum communications, including sources, detectors and both passive and active optical elements. We also illustrate the challenges associated with performing quantum communications on chip, by using the case study of quantum key distribution—the most advanced application of quantum information science. We conclude with promising perspectives in this field.}

Furthermore, for La2SeO2 it is explicitly shown that Na impurities substituting La are shallow acceptors in moderate to strong anion-rich growth conditions, with low formation energy and that they will not be compensated by anion vacancies VO or VSe.}

    abstract = {Abstract During the past ten years, the relaxation of international tensions between East and West has resulted in the so-called “peace dividends”. Among these dividends, solid state physicists have profited from the increasing availability of stable isotopes of many elements at affordable prices. These isotopes originate sometimes in the United States and sometimes in Russia. They can either be purchased or obtained “on loan” on the basis of scientific collaboration. With these isotopes, single crystals with tailor-made isotopic compositions have been grown. Using these crystals, information on a number of rather basic physical properties has been obtained. We discuss in this review the following properties of such semiconductor crystals: 1. dependence of the lattice parameters on isotopic masses; 2. effect of isotopic disorder on thermal conductivity; 3. anharmonic effects on the phonon frequencies and linewidths and their dependence on isotopic mass; 4. effects of isotopic disorder on phonon frequencies and linewidhts; 5. renormalization of the energy of electronic states through electron–phonon interaction; and 6. self-diffusion of atoms in crystals. Because of space limitations this discussion will not be exhaustive. We hope, however, to give sufficient references to published work so that the interested reader can easily find the primary literature sources to this rapidly expanding field of solid state physics.

In this work, we report a photoluminescence study of different samples of isotopically pure and natural zinc oxide between 15 and 300 K. The isotopic coefficients of the bound exciton energy have been obtained and compared with previous values for the shift of the free A exciton energy. The isotopic coefficients of the bound exciton energy have allowed us to estimate the contribution of the zinc and the oxygen vibrations to the bandgap renormalization by electron–phonon interaction. A two-oscillator model based on the zinc and oxygen renormalization energies has been used to account for the temperature dependence of the bandgap in ZnO.

The symmetry of the four excited states of the exciton bound to neutral donor (placed energetically below the free exciton) can be deduced from the observed dependence of their optical transitions on the direction of the wave vector and the polarization. Theoretical considerations taking into account the complex valence band structure of wurtzite-type semiconductors lead to an explanation of these states in terms of excited (p- and d-like) hole states of the bound exciton. With respect to the exciton bound to neutral acceptor only the well-known I1B-states are found experimentally arising from the incorporation of a hole from the lower B-subvalence band in the complex.},

    abstract = {Abstract The optical properties of excitonic recombinations in bulk, n-type ZnO are investigated by photoluminescence (PL) and spatially resolved cathodoluminescence (CL) measurements. At liquid helium temperature in undoped crystals the neutral donor bound excitons dominate in the PL spectrum. Two electron satellite transitions (TES) of the donor bound excitons allow to determine the donor binding energies ranging from 46 to 73 meV. These results are in line with the temperature dependent Hall effect measurements. In the as-grown crystals a shallow donor with an activation energy of 30 meV controls the conductivity. Annealing annihilates this shallow donor which has a bound exciton recombination at 3.3628 eV. Correlated by magnetic resonance experiments we attribute this particular donor to hydrogen. The Al, Ga and In donor bound exciton recombinations are identified based on doping and diffusion experiments and using secondary ion mass spectroscopy. We give a special focus on the recombination around 3.333 eV, i.e. about 50 meV below the free exciton transition. From temperature dependent measurements one obtains a small thermal activation energy for the quenching of the luminescence of 10 ± 2 meV despite the large localization energy of 50 meV. Spatially resolved CL measurements show that the 3.333 eV lines are particularly strong at crystal irregularities and occur only at certain spots hence are not homogeneously distributed within the crystal contrary to the bound exciton recombinations. We attribute them to excitons bound to structural defects (Y-line defect) very common in II–VI semiconductors. For the bound exciton lines which seem to be correlated with Li and Na doping we offer a different interpretation. Li and Na do not introduce any shallow acceptor level in ZnO which otherwise should show up in donor–acceptor pair recombinations. Nitrogen creates a shallow acceptor level in ZnO. Donor–acceptor pair recombination with the 165 meV deep N-acceptor is found in nitrogen doped and implanted ZnO samples, respectively. In the best undoped samples excited rotational states of the donor bound excitons can be seen in low temperature PL measurements. At higher temperatures we also see the appearance of the excitons bound to the B-valence band, which are approximately 4.7 meV higher in energy. (© 2004 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH \& Co. KGaA, Weinheim)},

    abstract = {Group IV donors in ZnO are poorly understood, despite evidence that they are effective n-type dopants. Here we present high-resolution photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy studies of unintentionally doped and Sn-doped ZnO single crystals grown by the chemical vapor transport method. Doped samples showed greatly increased emission from the I10 bound exciton transition that was recently proven to be related to the incorporation of Sn impurities based on radio-isotope studies. The PL linewidths are exceptionally sharp for these samples, enabling a clear identification of several donor species. Temperature-dependent PL measurements of the I10 line emission energy and intensity dependence reveal a behavior that is similar to other shallow donors in ZnO. Ionized donor bound-exciton and two-electron satellite transitions of the I10 transition are unambiguously identified and yield a donor binding energy of 71meV. In contrast to recent reports of Ge-related donors in ZnO, the spectroscopic binding energy for the Sn-related donor bound exciton follows a linear relationship with donor binding energy (Haynes rule) similar to recently observed carbon related donors, and confirming the shallow nature of this defect center, which was recently attributed to a SnZn double donor compensated by an unknown single acceptor.}

The polar interaction of the electron (hole) with LO phonons is stronger (weaker) in the complex than in the free exciton. Self-energies of the electron and the hole are lower and higher in comparison with the free exciton, respectively. The screening of the interaction between the particles changes too, which modifies the binding energy of the complex. In comparison with the case of purely Coulombic interaction the complex is more strongly (weakly) bound if the electron-hole mass ratio me/mh is small (large). Calculated interparticle distances give the picture of the complex in polar semiconductors as composed of two weakly bound two-particle complexes, i.e. the exciton and the neutron donor, for all me and mh. For the Coulomb interaction and for me greater than mh the complex goes over into a D- (donor and two electrons) with a weakly bound hold.}

The hole mass is investigated by tight-binding calculations of the valence bands, which have been adjusted to match experimental values of the valence-band curvature parameters at the top of the valence band. The calculations are in excellent agreement with femtosecond-laser reflectivity measurements of the change in optical effective mass as hot carriers cool from 1550 to 300 K.},

Measurement-based quantum computing (MBQC) requires neither direct interaction between qubits nor even what would be considered controlled generation of entanglement. Rather it can be achieved using entanglement that is generated probabilistically by the collapse of quantum states upon measurement. Single electronic spins in solids make suitable qubits for such an approach, offering long coherence times and well defined routes to optical measurement. We will review the theoretical basis of MBQC and experimental data for two frontrunner candidate qubits – nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond and semiconductor quantum dots – and discuss the prospects and challenges that lie ahead in realising MBQC in the solid state.},

abstract = {A scalable quantum computer could be built by networking together many simple processor cells, thus avoiding the need to create a single complex structure. The difficulty is that realistic quantum links are very error prone. A solution is for cells to repeatedly communicate with each other and so purify any imperfections; however prior studies suggest that the cells themselves must then have prohibitively low internal error rates. Here we describe a method by which even error-prone cells can perform purification: groups of cells generate shared resource states, which then enable stabilization of topologically encoded data. Given a realistically noisy network (≥10$\%$ error rate) we find that our protocol can succeed provided that intra-cell error rates for initialisation, state manipulation and measurement are below 0.82$\%$. This level of fidelity is already achievable in several laboratory systems.},

The direct application of the theory is difficult because of the need to evaluate numerically a two-dimensional integral. It is shown here how the integral may be trivially evaluated to within a few per cent for any zero phonon transition between non-degenerate electronic states. The method exploits the change in linewidth which results from the defects being forbidden to approach closer than some minimum distance to the optical centres. This change is found to be approximately the same for all transitions between non-degenerate levels.}

This chapter discusses some of the optical properties associated explicitly with the presence of imperfections in nonmetallic crystals. A primarily theoretical account of the current state of understanding of optical properties, with a view of deriving, or sketching the derivation of the important equations and formalisms generally in use is presented in the chapter. The concern is primarily with the mechanisms of importance rather than with the detailed interpretation of specific experiments. The most commonly used and almost invariably adequate procedure for treating the optical properties of atomic systems is the semiclassical approximation in which the radiation field is treated classically and the atomic system quantum mechanically. This procedure is discussed in the chapter. Among the conceivable optical properties relating to the various imperfections in solids, the most exciting are those associated with dislocations. In part, this is to use optical techniques to enhance the theory of dislocations, which has been responsible for such great advances in the understanding of mechanical properties of solids in recent years.}

Among the possibilities in the solid state, a defect in diamond known as the nitrogen-vacancy (NV-1) center stands out for its robustness—its quantum state can be initialized, manipulated, and measured with high fidelity at room temperature. Here we describe how to systematically identify other deep center defects with similar quantum-mechanical properties. We present a list of physical criteria that these centers and their hosts should meet and explain how these requirements can be used in conjunction with electronic structure theory to intelligently sort through candidate defect systems. To illustrate these points in detail, we compare electronic structure calculations of the NV-1 center in diamond with those of several deep centers in 4H silicon carbide (SiC). We then discuss the proposed criteria for similar defects in other tetrahedrally coordinated semiconductors.}}

Defect centers in solid-state materials have emerged as potential intermediaries between other physical manifestations of qubits, such as superconducting qubits and photonic qubits, to leverage their complementary advantages. It remains an open question, however, how to design and to control quantum interfaces to defect centers. Such interfaces would enable quantum information to be moved seamlessly between different physical systems. Understanding and constructing the required interfaces would, therefore, unlock the next big steps in quantum computing, sensing, and communications. In this Perspective, we highlight promising coupling mechanisms, including dipole-, phonon-, and magnon-mediated interactions, and discuss how contributions from nanotechnologists will be paramount in realizing quantum information processors in the near-term.}

abstract = {Practical applications in quantum communication and quantum computation require the building blocks—quantum bits and quantum memory—to be sufficiently robust and long-lived to allow for manipulation and storage (see the Perspective by Boehme and McCarney). Steger et al. (p. 1280) demonstrate that the nuclear spins of 31P impurities in an almost isotopically pure sample of 28Si can have a coherence time of as long as 192 seconds at a temperature of ∼1.7 K. In diamond at room temperature, Maurer et al. (p. 1283) show that a spin-based qubit system comprised of an isotopic impurity (13C) in the vicinity of a color defect (a nitrogen-vacancy center) could be manipulated to have a coherence time exceeding one second. Such lifetimes promise to make spin-based architectures feasible building blocks for quantum information science. Defects in diamond can be operated as quantum memories at room temperature. Stable quantum bits, capable both of storing quantum information for macroscopic time scales and of integration inside small portable devices, are an essential building block for an array of potential applications. We demonstrate high-fidelity control of a solid-state qubit, which preserves its polarization for several minutes and features coherence lifetimes exceeding 1 second at room temperature. The qubit consists of a single 13C nuclear spin in the vicinity of a nitrogen-vacancy color center within an isotopically purified diamond crystal. The long qubit memory time was achieved via a technique involving dissipative decoupling of the single nuclear spin from its local environment. The versatility, robustness, and potential scalability of this system may allow for new applications in quantum information science.}

abstract={In quantum sensing, precision is typically limited by the maximum time interval over which phase can be accumulated. Memories have been used to enhance this time interval beyond the coherence lifetime and thus gain precision. Here, we demonstrate that by using a quantum memory an increased sensitivity can also be achieved. To this end, we use entanglement in a hybrid spin system comprising a sensing and a memory qubit associated with a single nitrogen-vacancy centre in diamond. With the memory we retain the full quantum state even after coherence decay of the sensor, which enables coherent interaction with distinct weakly coupled nuclear spin qubits. We benchmark the performance of our hybrid quantum system against use of the sensing qubit alone by gradually increasing the entanglement of sensor and memory. We further apply this quantum sensor-memory pair for high-resolution NMR spectroscopy of single 13C nuclear spins.},

abstract={Defects with associated electron and nuclear spins in solid-state materials have a long history relevant to quantum information science that goes back to the first spin echo experiments with silicon dopants in the 1950s. Since the turn of the century, the field has rapidly spread to a vast array of defects and host crystals applicable to quantum communication, sensing and computing. From simple spin resonance to long-distance remote entanglement, the complexity of working with spin defects is fast increasing, and requires an in-depth understanding of the defects' spin, optical, charge and material properties in this modern context. This is especially critical for discovering new relevant systems for specific quantum applications. In this Review, we expand upon all the key components of solid-state spin defects, with an emphasis on the properties of defects and of the host material, on engineering opportunities and on other pathways for improvement. This Review aims to be as defect and material agnostic as possible, with some emphasis on optical emitters, providing broad guidelines for the field of solid-state spin defects for quantum information.},

Despite a frequency difference of five orders of magnitude, there has been significant progress recently toward the transfer between microwave and optical photons with steadily improved efficiency in a coherent and bidirectional manner.

@article{tribollet2009ten,
	abstract = {In this article, I present a theoretical study of the electron and nuclear spin coherence times of shallow donor spin qubits in zinc oxide (ZnO) at low temperature. The influence of different spin-phonon processes as well as different spin-spin processes on the spin coherence time of shallow donors in ZnO is considered, both in the case of an electron spin qubit and in the case of a nuclear spin qubit encoded on a shallow donor. It is estimated that the electron spin coherence time of an isolated indium shallow donor in natural quasi-intrinsic ZnO is on the order of hundreds of microseconds, limited by the nuclear spectral diffusion process. The electron spin coherence time of an isolated indium shallow donor can be extended to few milliseconds in isotopically and chemically purified quasi-intrinsic ZnO. In this optimal case, the electron spin coherence time of an isolated indium shallow donor is only limited by a spin-lattice decoherence process. It is also estimated that the nuclear spin coherence time of an isolated indium shallow donor in natural quasi-intrinsic ZnO is on the order of hundreds of milliseconds, limited by the nuclear spectral diffusion process. The nuclear spin coherence time of an isolated indium shallow donor can be extended to few seconds in isotopically and chemically purified quasi-intrinsic ZnO. In this optimal case, the nuclear spin coherence time of an isolated indium shallow donor is only limited by the cross relaxation decoherence process. This study thus shows the great potential of electron and nuclear spin qubits encoded on shallow donors in isotopically and chemically purified quasi-intrinsic ZnO for the implementation of quantum processor and/or quantum memories.},

More recently, advances in optical resonator technologies have made it feasible to realize cQED in diamond. This article reviews progress towards coupling color centers in diamond to optical resonators, focusing on approaches compatible with quantum networks. We consider the challenges for cQED with solid-state emitters and introduce the relevant properties of diamond defect centers before examining two qualitatively different resonator designs: micrometer-scale Fabry--Perot cavities and diamond nanophotonic cavities. For each approach, we examine the underlying theory and fabrication, discuss strengths and outstanding challenges, and highlight state-of-the-art experiments.},

This article provides an overview of rare-earth-doped material properties and summarizes some of the most promising materials studied in our laboratory and by other groups for applications in quantum information storage and for ultra-wide bandwidth signal processing. Understanding and controlling spectral diffusion in these materials, which ultimately limits the achievable performance of any quantum memory system, is also briefly reviewed. Applications in quantum information impose stringent requirements on laser phase and frequency stability, and employing a narrow spectral hole in the inhomogeneous absorption profile in these materials as a frequency reference can dramatically improve laser stability. We review our work on laser frequency and phase stabilization and report our recent results on using a narrow spectral hole as a passive dynamic spectral filter for laser phase noise suppression, which can dramatically narrow the laser linewidth with or without the requirement of active feedback.}}

In 87Rb negligible 4WM was observed and we obtained one pulse-width of delay with 50% efficiency. In 85Rb 4WM contributes to the output. In this regime we achieve a delay-bandwidth product of 3.7 at 50% efficiency, allowing temporally multimode delay, which we demonstrate by compressing two pulses into the memory medium.}

title = {Nanophotonics for quantum optics using nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond},
journal = {Nanotechnology},
abstract = {Optical microcavities and waveguides coupled to diamond are needed to enable efficient communication between quantum systems such as nitrogen-vacancy centers which are known already to have long electron spin coherence lifetimes. This paper describes recent progress in realizing microcavities with low loss and small mode volume in two hybrid systems: silica microdisks coupled to diamond nanoparticles, and gallium phosphide microdisks coupled to single-crystal diamond. A theoretical proposal for a gallium phosphide nanowire photonic crystal cavity coupled to diamond is also discussed. Comparing the two material systems, silica microdisks are easier to fabricate and test. However, at low temperature, nitrogen-vacancy centers in bulk diamond are spectrally more stable, and we expect that in the long term the bulk diamond approach will be better suited for on-chip integration of a photonic network.}

Demand for a functioning quantum memory, with high efficiency and coherence times approaching a millisecond, is therefore at a premium. Here we report on work towards this goal, with the development of a 87Rb magneto-optical trap with a peak optical depth of 1000 for the D2 F  =  2 → F′  =  3 transition using spatial and temporal dark spots. With this purpose-built cold atomic ensemble we implemented the gradient echo memory (GEM) scheme on the D1 line. Our data shows a memory efficiency of 80 $\pm$ 2% and coherence times up to 195 μs.},

We show that with a large excited-state detuning, the photon indistinguishability can be drastically improved provided that the fluctuation rate of the noise source affecting the excited state is fast compared with the photon emission rate. In some cases a spectral filter is required to realize this improvement, but the cost in efficiency can be made small.}

The proposed scheme leverages the similar transition frequencies between In donor bound excitons in ZnO and the P21/2 to S21/2 transition in Yb+. The lifetime of the relevant ionic state is longer than that of the ZnO system by a factor of 6, leading to a mismatch in the temporal profiles of emitted photons. A detuned cavity-assisted Raman scheme weakly excites the donor with a shaped laser pulse to generate photons with a 0.99 temporal overlap to the Yb+ emission and partially shift the emission of the defect toward the Yb+ transition. The remaining photon shift is accomplished via the dc Stark effect. We show that an entanglement rate of 2.1×104 s−1 and an entanglement fidelity of 94\\% can be attained using a weak excitation scheme with reasonable parameters.}",

To correct this behavior, the expression was modified by terms dependent on the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers built directly into the formula. The formula thus modified turns out to be a useful alternative to the Dunham expansion for not-too-long progressions or sequences of rovibrational bands as it provides a precision of fit better or at least comparable to the Dunham series with the same number of adjustable parameters. Application of this modified energy expression to individual bands (such as fundamental bands) is shown to yield accurate estimates for equilibrium rotational constantsBeand equilibrium internuclear distancesrewhich are in many cases better than values obtained from standard power series analyses of single bands. Useful estimates are also obtained for the zero-order vibrational frequencies ωeand for the positions of the lower overtone or combination bands. Such information is otherwise not accessible from a conventional analysis of an individual band.}
