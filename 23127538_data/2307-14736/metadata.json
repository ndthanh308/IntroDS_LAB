  "abstract": "To this day there is no satisfactory answer to the question how mental patterns correspond to physical states of our brain. For more than six decades, progress has been held up by the logjam between two traditions, one inspired by neuroscience, the other by digital computing. This logjam is well illuminated by Fodor and Pylyshyn's article of 1988, which is mainly devoted to a critique of what they call Connectionism, but also lays bare weaknesses of the Classical approach which they defend. As recent machine learning breakthroughs may be expected to through new light on the issue, it seems time to arrive at a synthesis of the connectionist neural approach and the classical stance based on symbol processing. I will present and discuss an attempt at such synthesis in the form of structured, self-organized neural networks.",
