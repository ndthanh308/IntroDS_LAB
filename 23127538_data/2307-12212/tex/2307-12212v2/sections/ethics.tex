\section{Ethical Considerations and Responsible Disclosure}\label{sec:ethics}

%
%

Our work discovers a vulnerability in an existing system with thousands of users, and our experiments involve mounting an attack on the live IPFS network. This may raise ethical concerns. However, we have worked closely with Protocol Labs, the company that created and maintains IPFS and \texttt{libp2p}, to develop mitigations for the attack and ensure that our experiments do not cause harm to any existing users.

As soon as we discovered the potential security impact of the vulnerability in June 2021, we initiated a responsible disclosure process by contacting Protocol Labs. Subsequently, the vulnerability has been assigned a CVE record CVE-2023-262481\footnote{\url{https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-26248}}. Details of the CVE record will be made public once the mitigation is deployed and this work is published.

To ensure no harm or danger to regular operations or honest users, we limited our censorship attacks to randomly generated content published by our own nodes. Our attacker nodes were implemented to only drop messages related to our randomly generated content and behave normally otherwise to avoid any other side effects on the network.

Throughout the process, Protocol Labs actively supported our research by providing access to their datasets, including network crawls. They welcomed further research based on our findings and provided advice on performance requirements for detection and mitigation techniques. 
Public disclosure of the vulnerability was carried out at IPFS Camp 2022~\cite{ipfs_camp2022}
held by Protocol Labs,
%
which included discussions with IPFS developers, maintainers, and other researchers.

We are currently working with Protocol Labs on the deployment of our detection and mitigation methods in the next version of the \texttt{libp2p} DHT.
This deployment will benefit other systems using \texttt{libp2p}, including Ethereum ~\cite{eth19discovery}, Celestia~\cite{celestia}, or Polkadot~\cite{burdges2020overview}.
Our mechanisms are not specific to the \texttt{libp2p} implementation of the Kademlia protocol and can be ported to other implementations of the DHT by their maintainers.
We commit to assisting these maintainers in this task.
