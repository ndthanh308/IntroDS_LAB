  "abstract": "In this paper, we study the following Cauchy problem for linear visco-elastic damped wave models with a general time-dependent coefficient $g=g(t)$: \\begin{equation} \\label{EqAbstract} \\tag{$\\star$} \\begin{cases} u_{tt}- Δu + g(t)(-Δ)u_t=0, &(t,x) \\in (0,\\infty) \\times \\mathbb{R}^n, \\\\ u(0,x)= u_0(x),\\quad u_t(0,x)= u_1(x), &x \\in \\mathbb{R}^n. \\end{cases} \\end{equation} We are interested to study the influence of the damping term $g(t)(-Δ)u_t$ on qualitative properties of solutions to \\eqref{EqAbstract} as decay estimates for energies of higher order and the parabolic effect. The main tools are related to WKB-analysis. We apply elliptic as well as hyperbolic WKB-analysis in different parts of the extended phase space.",
