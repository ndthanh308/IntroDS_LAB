  "abstract": "We present here a proof of the classical reduction of singularities based on the idea of \"idealistic flowers\". We follow the general ideas of Maximal Contact Theory, presented in a recent book of Aroca, Hironaka and Vicente, that recovers three old publications of Jorge Juan Institute. The concept of idealistic flowers deals with the globalization problems arising from the local nature of the maximal contact.",
