@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="This setup is adequate for the core physics in the current paper; also, we can always ensure the nilpotence of $\protect \boldsymbol  {J}$ by bundling a sufficient number of unit cells. "}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="More general boundary impurities are still solvable within the current transfer matrix framework with increased supercell sizes and thus computational complexity. "}
@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="We may encounter multiple solutions or no solution for certain $m$ values. "}
@FOOTNOTE{Note4,key="Note4",note="Here, we assume all physical energies corresponding to $\Gamma \protect \neq  0$, neglecting particular situations where specific discrete energies lead to $\Gamma =0$. "}
@FOOTNOTE{Note5,key="Note5",note="The LRA region may contain the extreme modes with $\protect \text  {Re}\left (\log {c_{m}}\right )=0$, which are beyond the scope of the current paper. "}
@FOOTNOTE{Note6,key="Note6",note="We uniformly label the coordinate axis of the numerical energy spectrum (eigenstates) as $(\protect \text  {Re}(\protect \text  {E}),\protect \text  {Im}(\protect \text  {E}))$ [($\protect \text  {site},|\psi |$)] for simplicity throughout this paper. "}
@FOOTNOTE{Note7,key="Note7",note="We have kept the notations of the annihilation and creation operators after the generalized gauge transformation. "}
