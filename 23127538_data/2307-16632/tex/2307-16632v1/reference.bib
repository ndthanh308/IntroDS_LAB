abstract={We introduce the exceptional topological insulator (ETI), a non-Hermitian topological state of matter that features exotic non-Hermitian surface states which can only exist within the three-dimensional topological bulk embedding. We show how this phase can evolve from a Weyl semimetal or Hermitian three-dimensional topological insulator close to criticality when quasiparticles acquire a finite lifetime. The ETI does not require any symmetry to be stabilized. It is characterized by a bulk energy point gap, and exhibits robust surface states that cover the bulk gap as a single sheet of complex eigenvalues or with a single exceptional point. The ETI can be induced universally in gapless solid-state systems, thereby setting a paradigm for non-Hermitian topological matter.},

abstract={Skin effect, experimentally discovered in one dimension, describes the physical phenomenon that on an open chain, an extensive number of eigenstates of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian are localized at the end(s) of the chain. Here in two and higher dimensions, we establish a theorem that the skin effect exists, if and only if periodic-boundary spectrum of the Hamiltonian covers a finite area on the complex plane. This theorem establishes the universality of the effect, because the above condition is satisfied in almost every generic non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, and, unlike in one dimension, is compatible with all point-group symmetries. We propose two new types of skin effect in two and higher dimensions: the corner-skin effect where all eigenstates are localized at corners of the system, and the geometry-dependent-skin effect where skin modes disappear for systems of a particular shape, but appear on generic polygons. An immediate corollary of our theorem is that any non-Hermitian system having exceptional points (lines) in two (three) dimensions exhibits skin effect, making this phenomenon accessible to experiments in photonic crystals, Weyl semimetals, and Kondo insulators.},

abstract={Collective guidance of out-of-equilibrium systems without using external fields is a challenge of paramount importance in active matter, ranging from bacterial colonies to swarms of self-propelled particles. Designing strategies to guide active matter and exploiting enhanced diffusion associated to its motion will provide insights for application from sensing, drug delivery to water remediation. However, achieving directed motion without breaking detailed balance, for example by asymmetric topographical patterning, is challenging. Here we engineer a two-dimensional periodic topographical design with detailed balance in its unit cell where we observe spontaneous particle edge guidance and corner accumulation of self-propelled particles. This emergent behaviour is guaranteed by a second-order non-Hermitian skin effect, a topologically robust non-equilibrium phenomenon, that we use to dynamically break detailed balance. Our stochastic circuit model predicts, without fitting parameters, how guidance and accumulation can be controlled and enhanced by design: a device guides particles more efficiently if the topological invariant characterizing it is non-zero. Our work establishes a fruitful bridge between active and topological matter, and our design principles offer a blueprint to design devices that display spontaneous, robust and predictable guided motion and accumulation, guaranteed by out-of-equilibrium topology.},

abstract={Strong, non-perturbative interactions often lead to new exciting physics, as epitomized by emergent anyons from the Fractional Quantum hall effect. Within the actively investigated domain of non-Hermitian physics, we provide a family of states known as non-Hermitian skin clusters. Taking distinct forms as Vertex, Topological, Interface, Extended and Localized skin clusters, they generically originate from asymmetric correlated hoppings on a lattice, in the strongly interacting limit with quenched single-body energetics. Distinct from non-Hermitian skin modes which accumulate at boundaries, our skin clusters are predominantly translation invariant particle clusters. As purely interacting phenomena, they fall outside the purview of generalized Brillouin zone analysis, although our effective lattice formulation provides alternative analytic and topological characterization. Non-Hermitian skin clusters originate from the fragmentation structure of the Hilbert space and may thus be of significant interest in modern many-body contexts such as the Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) and quantum scars.},

title = {A non-Hermitian Hamilton operator and the physics of open quantum systems},
journal = {Journal of Physics A: Mathematical and Theoretical},
abstract = {The Hamiltonian Heff of an open quantum system consists formally of a first-order interaction term describing the closed (isolated) system with discrete states and a second-order term caused by the interaction of the discrete states via the common continuum of scattering states. Under certain conditions, the last term may be dominant. Due to this term, Heff is non-Hermitian. Using the Feshbach projection operator formalism, the solution ΨEc of the Schrödinger equation in the whole function space (with discrete as well as scattering states, and the Hermitian Hamilton operator H) can be represented in the interior of the localized part of the system in the set of eigenfunctions ϕλ of Heff. Hence, the characteristics of the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the non-Hermitian operator Heff are contained in observable quantities. Controlling the characteristics by means of external parameters, quantum systems can be manipulated. This holds, in particular, for small quantum systems coupled to a small number of channels. The paper consists of three parts. In the first part, the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of non-Hermitian operators are considered. Most important are the true and avoided crossings of the eigenvalue trajectories. In approaching them, the phases of the ϕλ lose their rigidity and the values of observables may be enhanced. Here the second-order term of Heff determines decisively the dynamics of the system. The time evolution operator is related to the non-Hermiticity of Heff. In the second part of the paper, the solution ΨEc and the S matrix are derived by using the Feshbach projection operator formalism. The regime of overlapping resonances is characterized by non-rigid phases of the ΨEc (expressed quantitatively by the phase rigidity ρ). They determine the internal impurity of an open quantum system. Here, level repulsion passes into width bifurcation (resonance trapping): a dynamical phase transition takes place which is caused by the feedback between environment and system. In the third part, the internal impurity of open quantum systems is considered by means of concrete examples. Bound states in the continuum appearing at certain parameter values can be used in order to stabilize open quantum systems. Of special interest are the consequences of the non-rigidity of the phases of ϕλ not only for the problem of dephasing, but also for the dynamical phase transitions and questions related to them such as phase lapses and enhancement of observables.}

abstract={Non-Hermitian systems have been shown to have a dramatic sensitivity to their boundary conditions. In particular, the non-Hermitian skin effect induces collective boundary localization upon turning off boundary coupling, a feature very distinct from that under periodic boundary conditions. Here we develop a full framework for non-Hermitian impurity physics in a non-reciprocal lattice, with periodic/open boundary conditions and even their interpolations being special cases across a whole range of boundary impurity strengths. We uncover steady states with scale-free localization along or even against the direction of non-reciprocity in various impurity strength regimes. Also present are Bloch-like states that survive albeit broken translational invariance. We further explore the co-existence of non-Hermitian skin effect and scale-free localization, where even qualitative aspects of the system's spectrum can be extremely sensitive to impurity strength. Specific circuit setups are also proposed for experimentally detecting the scale-free accumulation, with simulation results confirming our main findings.},

title={Non-Hermitian bulk--boundary correspondence in quantum dynamics},
journal={Nature Physics},
year={2020},
month={Jul},
day={01},
volume={16},
number={7},
pages={761-766},
abstract={Bulk--boundary correspondence, a guiding principle in topological matter, relates robust edge states to bulk topological invariants. Its validity, however, has so far been established only in closed systems. Recent theoretical studies indicate that this principle requires fundamental revisions for a wide range of open systems with effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. Therein, the intriguing localization of nominal bulk states at boundaries, known as the non-Hermitian skin effect, suggests a non-Bloch band theory in which non-Bloch topological invariants are defined in generalized Brillouin zones, leading to a general bulk--boundary correspondence beyond the conventional framework. Here, we experimentally observe this fundamental non-Hermitian bulk--boundary correspondence in discrete-time non-unitary quantum-walk dynamics of single photons. We demonstrate pronounced photon localizations near boundaries even in the absence of topological edge states, thus confirming the non-Hermitian skin effect. Facilitated by our experimental scheme of edge-state reconstruction, we directly measure topological edge states, which are in excellent agreement with the non-Bloch topological invariants. Our work unequivocally establishes the non-Hermitian bulk--boundary correspondence as a general principle underlying non-Hermitian topological systems and paves the way for a complete understanding of topological matter in open systems.},

abstract={Strong, non-perturbative interactions often lead to new exciting physics, as epitomized by emergent anyons from the Fractional Quantum hall effect. Within the actively investigated domain of non-Hermitian physics, we provide a family of states known as non-Hermitian skin clusters. Taking distinct forms as Vertex, Topological, Interface, Extended and Localized skin clusters, they generically originate from asymmetric correlated hoppings on a lattice, in the strongly interacting limit with quenched single-body energetics. Distinct from non-Hermitian skin modes which accumulate at boundaries, our skin clusters are predominantly translation invariant particle clusters. As purely interacting phenomena, they fall outside the purview of generalized Brillouin zone analysis, although our effective lattice formulation provides alternative analytic and topological characterization. Non-Hermitian skin clusters originate from the fragmentation structure of the Hilbert space and may thus be of significant interest in modern many-body contexts such as the Eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) and quantum scars.},

abstract={Non-Hermitian systems have been shown to have a dramatic sensitivity to their boundary conditions. In particular, the non-Hermitian skin effect induces collective boundary localization upon turning off boundary coupling, a feature very distinct from that under periodic boundary conditions. Here we develop a full framework for non-Hermitian impurity physics in a non-reciprocal lattice, with periodic/open boundary conditions and even their interpolations being special cases across a whole range of boundary impurity strengths. We uncover steady states with scale-free localization along or even against the direction of non-reciprocity in various impurity strength regimes. Also present are Bloch-like states that survive albeit broken translational invariance. We further explore the co-existence of non-Hermitian skin effect and scale-free localization, where even qualitative aspects of the system's spectrum can be extremely sensitive to impurity strength. Specific circuit setups are also proposed for experimentally detecting the scale-free accumulation, with simulation results confirming our main findings.},

abstract={Critical systems represent physical boundaries between different phases of matter and have been intensely studied for their universality and rich physics. Yet, with the rise of non-Hermitian studies, fundamental concepts underpinning critical systems - like band gaps and locality - are increasingly called into question. This work uncovers a new class of criticality where eigenenergies and eigenstates of non-Hermitian lattice systems jump discontinuously across a critical point in the thermodynamic limit, unlike established critical scenarios with spectrum remaining continuous across a transition. Such critical behavior, dubbed the ``critical non-Hermitian skin effect'', arises whenever subsystems with dissimilar non-reciprocal accumulations are coupled, however weakly. This indicates, as elaborated with the generalized Brillouin zone approach, that the thermodynamic and zero-coupling limits are not exchangeable, and that even a large system can be qualitatively different from its thermodynamic limit. Examples with anomalous scaling behavior are presented as manifestations of the critical non-Hermitian skin effect in finite-size systems. More spectacularly, topological in-gap modes can even be induced by changing the system size. We provide an explicit proposal for detecting the critical non-Hermitian skin effect in an RLC circuit setup, which also directly carries over to established setups in non-Hermitian optics and mechanics.},

journal = {Journal of Physics C: Solid State Physics},
abstract = {Using a new and powerful real space renormalisation method recently introduced for phase transitions, the authors prove numerically that two dimensions are marginal for Anderson localisation. An associated transition is found, presenting close analogies with the Kosterlitz-Thouless transition of the XY model in two dimensions, while the behaviour in three dimensions is shown to be a standard one with a mobility edge. The accuracy of the method is better than previous approaches in two dimensions and is not reduced when the number of dimensions is raised to three.}

Using the transfer matrix formalism, we solve and investigate in detail such states in the thermodynamic limit.

In this picture, the corresponding edge states naturally wind around non-contractile loops, defining a topological invariant associated to each gap of the system.}

abstract={The bulk-boundary correspondence (BBC), i.e. the direct relation between bulk topological invariants defined for infinite periodic systems and the occurrence of protected zero-energy surface states in finite samples, is a ubiquitous and widely observed phenomenon in topological matter. In non-Hermitian generalizations of topological systems, however, this fundamental correspondence has recently been found to be qualitatively altered, largely owing to the sensitivity of non-Hermitian eigenspectra to changing the boundary conditions. In this work, we report on two contributions towards comprehensively explaining this remarkable behavior unique to non-Hermitian systems with theory. First, we analytically solve paradigmatic non-Hermitian topological models for their zero-energy modes in the presence of generalized boundary conditions interpolating between open and periodic boundary conditions, thus explicitly following the breakdown of the conventional BBC. Second, addressing the aforementioned spectral fragility of non-Hermitian matrices, we investigate as to what extent the modified non-Hermitian BBC represents a robust and generically observable phenomenon.},

abstract={Non-Hermitian boundaries commonly take place in many open quantum systems locally coupled to a surrounding environment. Here, we reveal a type of non-Hermitian effect induced by non-Hermitian boundaries, the non-Hermitian proximity effect (NHPE), which describes the penetration of non-Hermiticity from the boundary into the bulk. For gapped quantum systems, the NHPE generates in-gap states with imaginary eigenenergies, termed ``imaginary in-gap states". The imaginary in-gap states are localized at the system boundary and decay into the bulk, analogous to the behaviors of the conventional impurity states. However, in contrast to impurity states, the imaginary in-gap states exhibit distinct dynamical behaviors under time-evolution. Moreover, they are physically manifested as corner modes under open boundaries, as a combined result of the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) and NHPE. These results not only uncover implicit similarities between quantum systems with non-Hermitian boundaries and impurity physics, but also point to intriguing non-Hermitian phenomena broadly relevant to open quantum systems.},

Following which, emerging topics are introduced such as non-Hermitian criticality, dynamical NHSE phenomena, and the manifestation of NHSE beyond the traditional linear non-interacting crystal lattices, particularly its interplay with quantum many-body interactions.
