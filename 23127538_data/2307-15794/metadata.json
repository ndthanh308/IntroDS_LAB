  "abstract": "Laminations are a combinatorial and topological way to study Julia sets. Laminations give information about the structure of parameter space of degree $d$ polynomials with connected Julia sets. We first study fixed point portraits in laminations and their respective global count. Then, we investigate the correspondence between locally unicritical laminations and locally maximally critical laminations with rotational polygons. The global correspondence has been shown in \\cite{Burdette:2022}.",
