  "abstract": "This thesis is divided into two parts. In the first part, we study models of $(\\infty,ω)$-categories. The main result is to establish a Quillen equivalence between Rezk's complete Segal $Θ$-spaces and Verity's complicial sets.\n  In the second part, we study the $(\\infty,1)$-category corresponding to these two model structures, denoted by $(\\infty,ω)$-cat. Its connection with Rezk's complete Segal $Θ$-spaces allows us to use the globular language, while its connection with complicial sets gives us access to a fundamental operation, the Gray tensor product. The objective will be to implement standard categorical constructions in the context of $(\\infty,ω)$-categories. A special emphasis will be placed on the Grothendieck construction.",
