	abstract = {One of the training strategies of generative models is to minimize the Jensen--Shannon divergence between the model distribution and the data distribution. Since data distribution is unknown, generative adversarial networks (GANs) formulate this problem as a game between two models, a generator and a discriminator. The training can be formulated in the context of game theory and the local Nash equilibrium (LNE). It does not seem feasible to derive guarantees of stability or optimality for the existing methods. This optimization problem is far more challenging than the single objective setting. Here, we use the conjugate gradient method to reliably and efficiently solve the LNE problem in GANs. We give a proof and convergence analysis under mild assumptions showing that the proposed method converges to a LNE with three different learning rate update rules, including a constant learning rate. Finally, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and momentum SGD in terms of best Frechet inception distance (FID) score and outperforms Adam on average.},

	abstract = {Previous results have shown that a two time-scale update rule (TTUR) using different learning rates, such as different constant rates or different decaying rates, is useful for training generative adversarial networks (GANs) in theory and in practice. Moreover, not only the learning rate but also the batch size is important for training GANs with TTURs and they both affect the number of steps needed for training. This paper studies the relationship between batch size and the number of steps needed for training GANs with TTURs based on constant learning rates. We theoretically show that, for a TTUR with constant learning rates, the number of steps needed to find stationary points of the loss functions of both the discriminator and generator decreases as the batch size increases and that there exists a critical batch size minimizing the stochastic first-order oracle (SFO) complexity. Then, we use the Fr{\'e}chet inception distance (FID) as the performance measure for training and provide numerical results indicating that the number of steps needed to achieve a low FID score decreases as the batch size increases and that the SFO complexity increases once the batch size exceeds the measured critical batch size. Moreover, we show that measured critical batch sizes are close to the sizes estimated from our theoretical results.},

	abstract = {We provide stronger and more general primal-dual convergence results for Frank-Wolfe-type algorithms (a.k.a. conditional gradient) for constrained convex optimization, enabled by a simple framework of duality gap certificates. Our analysis also holds if the linear subproblems are only solved approximately (as well as if the gradients are inexact), and is proven to be worst-case optimal in the sparsity of the obtained solutions.    On the application side, this allows us to unify a large variety of existing sparse greedy methods, in particular for optimization over convex hulls of an atomic set, even if those sets can only be approximated, including sparse (or structured sparse) vectors or matrices, low-rank matrices, permutation matrices, or max-norm bounded matrices.    We present a new general framework for convex optimization over matrix factorizations, where every Frank-Wolfe iteration will consist of a low-rank update, and discuss the broad application areas of this approach.},

In a well-studied model where algorithms access smooth, potentially non-convex functions through queries to an unbiased stochastic gradient oracle with bounded variance, we prove that (in the worst case) any algorithm requires at least {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}epsilon \^{}{\{}-4{\}}{\$}{\$}queries to find an {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}epsilon {\$}{\$}-stationary point. The lower bound is tight, and establishes that stochastic gradient descent is minimax optimal in this model. In a more restrictive model where the noisy gradient estimates satisfy a mean-squared smoothness property, we prove a lower bound of {\$}{\$}{$\backslash$}epsilon \^{}{\{}-3{\}}{\$}{\$}queries, establishing the optimality of recently proposed variance reduction techniques.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces a fusion convolutional architecture for efficient learning of spatio-temporal features in video action recognition. Unlike 2D convolutional neural networks (CNNs), 3D CNNs can be applied directly on consecutive frames to extract spatio-temporal features. The aim of this work is to fuse the convolution layers from 2D and 3D CNNs to allow temporal encoding with fewer parameters than 3D CNNs. We adopt transfer learning from pre-trained 2D CNNs for spatial extraction, followed by temporal encoding, before connecting to 3D convolution layers at the top of the architecture. We construct our fusion architecture, semi-CNN, based on three popular models: VGG-16, ResNets and DenseNets, and compare the performance with their corresponding 3D models. Our empirical results evaluated on the action recognition dataset UCF-101 demonstrate that our fusion of 1D, 2D and 3D convolutions outperforms its 3D model of the same depth, with fewer parameters and reduces overfitting. Our semi-CNN architecture achieved an average of 16&ndash;30% boost in the top-1 accuracy when evaluated on an input video of 16 frames.},
