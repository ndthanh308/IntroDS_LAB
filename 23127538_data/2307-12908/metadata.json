  "abstract": "We describe a framework for the controllability analysis of networks of $n$ quantum systems of an arbitrary dimension $d$, {\\it qudits}, with dynamics determined by Hamiltonians that are invariant under the permutation group $S_n$. Because of the symmetry, the underlying Hilbert space, ${\\cal H}=(\\mathbb{C}^d)^{\\otimes n}$, splits into invariant subspaces for the Lie algebra of $S_n$-invariant elements in $u(d^n)$, denoted here by $u^{S_n}(d^n)$. The dynamical Lie algebra ${\\cal L}$, which determines the controllability properties of the system, is a Lie subalgebra of such a Lie algebra $u^{S_n}(d^n)$. If ${\\cal L}$ acts as $su\\left( \\dim(V) \\right)$ on each of the invariant subspaces $V$, the system is called {\\it subspace controllable}. Our approach is based on recognizing that such a splitting of the Hilbert space ${\\cal H}$ coincides with the {\\it Clebsch-Gordan} splitting of $(\\mathbb{C}^d)^{\\otimes n}$ into {\\it irreducible representations} of $su(d)$. In this view, $u^{S_n}(d^n)$, is the direct sum of certain $su(n_j)$ for some $n_j$'s we shall specify, and its {\\it center} which is the Abelian (Lie) algebra generated by the {\\it Casimir operators}. Generalizing the situation previously considered in the literature, we consider dynamics with arbitrary local simultaneous control on the qudits and a symmetric two body interaction. Most of the results presented are for general $n$ and $d$ but we recast previous results on $n$ qubits in this new general framework and provide a complete treatment and proof of subspace controllability for the new case of $n=3$, $d=3$, that is, {\\it three qutrits}.",
