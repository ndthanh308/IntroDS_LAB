  "abstract": "For any Coxeter system, and any double coset for two standard parabolic subgroups, we introduce a Demazure operator. These operators form a basis for morphism spaces in a category we call the nilCoxeter category, and we also present this category by generators and relations. We prove a generalization to this context of Demazure's celebrated theorem on Frobenius extensions. This generalized theorem serves as a criterion for ensuring the proper behavior of singular Soergel bimodules.",
