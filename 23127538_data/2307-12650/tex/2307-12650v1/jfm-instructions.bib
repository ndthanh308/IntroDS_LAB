Flow control is achieved through moving flaps fixed on every edge around the two rear flat surfaces of the model. Different pairs of flaps, with variable angle compared to the walls, are tested. Parametric studies show that the most efficient configuration for the flaps is along the side edges of the rear slant, i.e. in the region where longitudinal vortices are created, and also at the junction between the roof and the rear slant, where the flow separates. We also explore the combinations of different flap configurations. We find interesting results showing cumulative effects between some configurations leading to −25\% drag reduction and −105\% lift reduction. Finally, particle image velocimetry measurements show that one of the key effects is the control of the longitudinal vortices created at the side edges of the rear slant.},

	abstract = {The term plasma actuator has now been a part of the fluid dynamics flow-control vernacular for more than a decade. A particular type of plasma actuator that has gained wide use is based on a single–dielectric barrier discharge (SDBD) mechanism that has desirable features for use in air at atmospheric pressures. For these actuators, the mechanism of flow control is through a generated body-force vector field that couples with the momentum in the external flow. The body force can be derived from first principles, and the effect of plasma actuators can be easily incorporated into flow solvers so that their placement and operation can be optimized. They have been used in a wide range of internal and external flow applications. Although initially considered useful only at low speeds, plasma actuators are effective in a number of applications at high subsonic, transonic, and supersonic Mach numbers, owing largely to more optimized actuator designs that were developed through better understanding and modeling of the actuator physics. New applications continue to appear through a growing number of programs in the United States, Germany, France, England, the Netherlands, Russia, Australia, Japan, and China. This review provides an overview of the physics and modeling of SDBD plasma actuators. It highlights some of the capabilities of plasma actuators through examples from experiments and simulations.},

This paper focuses on finding a closed-loop strategy to reduce the drag of a cylinder in laminar flow conditions. Deep reinforcement learning algorithms have been implemented to discover efficient control schemes, using two synthetic jets located on the cylinder's poles as actuators and pressure sensors in the wake of the cylinder as feedback observation. The present work focuses on the efficiency and robustness of the identified control strategy and introduces a novel algorithm (S-PPO-CMA) to optimise the sensor layout. An energy-efficient control strategy reducing drag by 18.4\%18.4\%18.4{\textbackslash},{\textbackslash}\% at a Reynolds number of 120120120 is obtained. This control policy is shown to be robust both to a Reynolds-number variation in the range [100;216][100;216][100;216] and to measurement noise, for signal-to-noise ratios as low as 0.20.20.2 with negligible impact on performance. Along with a systematic study on sensor number and location, the proposed sparsity-seeking algorithm has achieved a successful optimisation to a reduced five-sensor layout while keeping state-of-the-art performance. These results further highlight the interesting possibilities of reinforcement learning for active flow control and pave the way to efficient, robust and practical implementations of these control techniques in experimental or industrial systems.},

Fluid Mech. 865, 281–302 (2019)] has demonstrated the feasibility and effectiveness of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) in performing AFC over a circular cylinder at Re = 100, i.e., in the laminar flow regime. As a follow-up study, we investigate the same AFC problem at an intermediate Reynolds number, i.e., Re = 1000, where the weak turbulence in the flow poses great challenges to the control. The results show that the DRL agent can still find effective control strategies, but requires much more episodes in the learning. A remarkable drag reduction of around 30\% is achieved, which is accompanied by elongation of the recirculation bubble and reduction of turbulent fluctuations in the cylinder wake. Furthermore, we also perform a sensitivity analysis on the learnt control strategies to explore the optimal layout of sensor network. To our best knowledge, this study is the first successful application of DRL to AFC in weakly turbulent conditions. It therefore sets a new milestone in progressing toward AFC in strong turbulent flows.},

Fluid Mech. 865, 281-302 (2019)]. However, while promising results were obtained on a simple 2-dimensional benchmark flow at a moderate Reynolds number, considerable speedups will be required to investigate more challenging flow configurations. In the case of DRL trained with Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) data, it was found that the CFD part, rather than training the artificial neural network, was the limiting factor for speed of execution. Therefore, speedups should be obtained through a combination of two approaches. The first one, which is well documented in the literature, is to parallelize the numerical simulation itself. The second one is to adapt the DRL algorithm for parallelization. Here, a simple strategy is to use several independent simulations running in parallel to collect experiences faster. In the present work, we discuss this solution for parallelization. We illustrate that perfect speedups can be obtained up to the batch size of the DRL agent, and slightly suboptimal scaling still takes place for an even larger number of simulations. This is, therefore, an important step toward enabling the study of more sophisticated fluid mechanics problems through DRL.},

It is shown that, in a two-dimensional simulation of the Karman vortex street at moderate Reynolds number (Re = 100), our artificial neural network is able to learn an active control strategy from experimenting with the mass flow rates of two jets on the sides of a cylinder. By interacting with the unsteady wake, the artificial neural network successfully stabilizes the vortex alley and reduces drag by approximately 8 \%. This is performed while using small mass flow rates for the actuation, of the order of 0.5 \% of the mass flow rate intersecting the cylinder cross-section once a new pseudo-periodic shedding regime is found.

This paper addresses the issue of actuator selection for active flow control by proposing a novel method built on top of a reinforcement learning agent. Starting from a pre-trained agent using numerous actuators, the algorithm estimates the impact of a potential actuator removal on the value function, indicating the agent's performance. It is applied to two test cases, the one-dimensional Kuramoto–Sivashinsky equation and a laminar bidimensional flow around an airfoil at ����=1000Re=1000Re=1000 for different angles of attack ranging from 12∘12∘12{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \} to 20∘20∘20{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}, to demonstrate its capabilities and limits. The proposed actuator-sparsification method relies on a sequential elimination of the least relevant action components, starting from a fully developed layout. The relevancy of each component is evaluated using metrics based on the value function. Results show that, while still being limited by this intrinsic elimination paradigm (i.e. the sequential elimination), actuator patterns and obtained policies demonstrate relevant performances and allow us to draw an accurate approximation of the Pareto front of performances versus actuator budget.},

Machine learning frameworks such as genetic programming and reinforcement learning (RL) are gaining popularity in flow control. This work presents a comparative analysis of the two, benchmarking some of their most representative algorithms against global optimization techniques such as Bayesian optimization and Lipschitz global optimization. First, we review the general framework of the model-free control problem, bringing together all methods as black-box optimization problems. Then, we test the control algorithms on three test cases. These are (1) the stabilization of a nonlinear dynamical system featuring frequency cross-talk, (2) the wave cancellation from a Burgers’ flow and (3) the drag reduction in a cylinder wake flow. We present a comprehensive comparison to illustrate their differences in exploration versus exploitation and their balance between ‘model capacity’ in the control law definition versus ‘required complexity’. Indeed, we discovered that previous RL control attempts of controlling the cylinder wake were performing linear control and that the wide observation space was limiting their performances. We believe that such a comparison paves the way towards the hybridization of the various methods, and we offer some perspective on their future development in the literature of flow control problems.},

This work reports the application of a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) based flow control strategy to suppress perturbations evolving in the one-dimensional linearised Kuramoto–Sivashinsky (KS) equation and two-dimensional boundary layer flows. The former is commonly used to model the disturbance developing in flat-plate boundary layer flows. These flow systems are convectively unstable, being able to amplify the upstream disturbance, and are thus difficult to control. The control action is implemented through a volumetric force at a fixed position, and the control performance is evaluated by the reduction of perturbation amplitude downstream. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the DRL-based control in the KS system subjected to a random upstream noise. The amplitude of perturbation monitored downstream is reduced significantly, and the learnt policy is shown to be robust to both measurement and external noise. One of our focuses is to place sensors optimally in the DRL control using the gradient-free particle swarm optimisation algorithm. After the optimisation process for different numbers of sensors, a specific eight-sensor placement is found to yield the best control performance. The optimised sensor placement in the KS equation is applied directly to control two-dimensional Blasius boundary layer flows, and can efficiently reduce the downstream perturbation energy. Via flow analyses, the control mechanism found by DRL is the opposition control. Besides, it is found that when the flow instability information is embedded in the reward function of DRL to penalise the instability, the control performance can be further improved in this convectively unstable flow.},

This work studies the application of a reinforcement learning (RL)-based flow control strategy to the flow past a cylinder confined between two walls to suppress vortex shedding. The control action is blowing and suction of two synthetic jets on the cylinder. The theme of this study is to investigate how to use and embed physical information of the flow in the RL-based control. First, global linear stability and sensitivity analyses based on the time-mean flow and the steady flow (which is a solution to the Navier–Stokes equations) are conducted in a range of blockage ratios and Reynolds numbers. It is found that the most sensitive region in the wake extends itself when either parameter increases in the parameter range we investigated here. Then, we use these physical results to help design RL-based control policies. We find that the controlled wake converges to the unstable steady base flow, where the vortex shedding can be successfully suppressed. A persistent oscillating control seems necessary to maintain this unstable state. The RL algorithm is able to outperform a gradient-based optimisation method (optimised in a certain period of time) in the long run. Furthermore, when the flow stability information is embedded in the reward function to penalise the instability, the controlled flow may become more stable. Finally, according to the sensitivity analyses, the control is most efficient when the probes are placed in the most sensitive region. The control can be successful even when few probes are properly placed in this manner.},

The feedback control law is optimized with respect to a cost functional based on the recirculation area and a penalization of the actuation. This optimization is performed employing genetic programming. After 12 generations comprised of 500 individuals, the algorithm converges to a feedback law which reduces the recirculation zone by 80 \%. This machine learning control is benchmarked against the best periodic forcing which excites Kelvin–Helmholtz vortices. The machine learning control yields a new actuation mechanism resonating with the low-frequency flapping mode instability. This feedback control performs similarly to periodic forcing at the design condition but outperforms periodic forcing when the Reynolds number is varied by a factor two. The current study indicates that machine learning control can effectively explore and optimize new feedback actuation mechanisms in numerous experimental applications.},

	abstract = {, An investigation of optimal feedback controllers’ performance and robustness is carried out for vortex shedding behind a two-dimensional cylinder at low Reynolds numbers. To facilitate controller design, we present an efficient modelling approach in which we utilise the resolvent operator to recast the linearised Navier–Stokes equations into an input–output form from which frequency responses can be computed. The difficulty of applying modern control design techniques to high-dimensional flow systems is overcome by using low-order models identified from frequency responses. These low-order models are used to design optimal controllers using H∞H∞\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{H\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}infty \} loop shaping. Two distinct single-input single-output control arrangements are considered. In the first arrangement, a velocity sensor located in the wake drives a pair of body forces near the cylinder. Complete suppression of shedding is observed up to Re=110Re=110Re=110. Due to the convective nature of vortex shedding and the corresponding time delays, we observe a fundamental trade-off: the sensor should be close enough to the cylinder to avoid excessive time lag, but it should be kept sufficiently far from the cylinder to measure unstable modes developing downstream. These two conflicting requirements become more difficult to satisfy for larger Reynolds numbers. In the second arrangement, we consider a practical set-up with an actuator that oscillates the cylinder according to the lift measurement. The system is stabilised up to Re=100Re=100Re=100, and we demonstrate why the performance of the resulting feedback controllers deteriorates more rapidly with increasing Reynolds number. The challenges of designing robust controllers for each control set-up are also analysed and discussed.},

Two backward-facing step cases are simulated: a laminar two-dimensional (2D) flow at a Reynolds number of , and a turbulent three-dimensional (3D) flow at  using large-eddy simulation. The control is effected by a full-span slot jet with zero-net-mass-flux, and two jet locations are examined. Linear system identification is performed to characterize the flow response to actuation, used to synthesize a control law. The control strategy is based on the premise that an attenuation of the instantaneous pressure fluctuations on the base of the step should lead to an increase in the time-averaged base pressure. Open-loop harmonic forcing is examined within a broad frequency range for both the 2D and 3D flows, which are found to respond differently to actuation. The controllers based on disturbance attenuation lead to sensible increases in base pressure (up to 70 \% in 2D and 20 \% in 3D) with higher efficiency than the best results achieved in open-loop. The results support the conjecture about the link between the base pressure fluctuations and mean, although it is shown that such a black-box model approach is not suitable for optimization without further physical insight.},

Spanwise-periodic flows over the airfoil at a chord-based Reynolds number of 230002300023{\textbackslash},000 and a free-stream Mach number of 0.30.30.3 are considered at two post-stall angles of attack of 6∘6∘6{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \} and 9∘9∘9{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}circ \}. Near the leading edge, localized unsteady thermal actuation is introduced in an open-loop manner with two tunable parameters of actuation frequency and spanwise wavelength. To provide physics-based guidance for the effective choice of these control input parameters, we conduct global resolvent analysis on the baseline turbulent mean flows to identify the actuation frequency and wavenumber that provide large perturbation energy amplification. The present analysis also considers the use of a temporal filter to limit the time horizon for assessing the energy amplification to extend resolvent analysis to unstable base flows. We incorporate the amplification and response mode from resolvent analysis to provide a metric that quantifies momentum mixing associated with the modal structure. This metric is compared to the results from a large number of three-dimensional large-eddy simulations of open-loop controlled flows. With the agreement between the resolvent-based metric and the enhancement of aerodynamic performance found through large-eddy simulations, we demonstrate that resolvent analysis can predict the effective range of actuation frequency as well as the global response to the actuation input. We believe that the present resolvent-based approach provides a promising path towards mean flow modification by capitalizing on the dominant modal mixing.},

When the cylinder rotation is used as flow actuation, the linearized Föppl system is shown to be stabilizable, but not controllable. With centerline velocity measurements as the system output, the linearized Föppl model is also shown to be fully observable. The Linear-Quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) control design is performed based on the linearized Föppl system which has only four degrees of freedom. Computational results show that thus designed LQG compensator stabilizes the stationary solution of the nonlinear Föppl system. When applied to an actual cylinder wake at Re=75, the LQG compensator stabilizes the downstream region of the flow. Possibilities and limitations of flow control strategies based on point vortex systems as reduced-order models are discussed.},

	abstract = {In the present work, a simple proportional feedback control is designed to suppress the vortex-shedding instability in the wake of a prototype bluff-body flow, i.e., the flow around a square cylinder confined in a channel with an incoming Poiseuille flow. Actuation is provided by two jets localized on the cylinder surface and velocity sensors are used for feedback control. This particular configuration is a pretext to propose a more general strategy for designing a controller, which is independent of the type of actuation and sensors. The method is based on the linear stability analysis of the flow, carried out on the unstable steady solution of the equations, which is also the target flow of the control. The idea is to use sensitivity analysis to predict the displacement in the complex plane of some selected eigenvalues, found by the linear stability analysis of the flow, as a function of the control design parameters. In this paper, it is shown that the information provided by only sensitivity analysis carried out on the uncontrolled system is not sufficient to design a controller which stabilizes the flow. Therefore, the control is designed iteratively by successive linearizations. Apart from possible constraints, the position of the sensors, the direction along which velocity is measured, and the feedback coefficients are outputs of the design procedure. The proposed strategy leads to a successful control up to a Reynolds number which is at least twice as large as the critical one for the primary instability, using only one velocity sensor.},

Such wakes have both large pressure drag and a number of coherent ﬂow structures associated with them. Depending on the geometry, these structures may include both a bistability resulting from a spatial symmetry breaking (SB), and a quasi-periodic vortex shedding. The authors have recently shown that the bistability may be modelled by a Langevin equation and that this model enables the design of a feedback control strategy that eﬃciently reduces the drag through suppression of asymmetry. In this work the stochastic modelling approach is extended to the vortex shedding, capturing qualitatively both the forced and unforced behaviour. A control strategy is then presented that makes use of the frequency response of the wake, and aims to reduce the measured ﬂuctuations associated with the vortex shedding. The strategy proves to be eﬀective at suppressing ﬂuctuations within speciﬁc frequency ranges but, due to ampliﬁcation of disturbances at other frequencies, is unable to give drag reduction.},

	abstract = {A speciﬁc feature of three-dimensional bluff body wakes, ﬂow bistability, is a subject of particular recent interest. This feature consists of a random ﬂipping of the wake between two asymmetric conﬁgurations and is believed to contribute to the pressure drag of many bluff bodies. In this study we apply the modelling approach recently suggested for axisymmetric bodies by Rigas et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 778, 2015, R2) to the reﬂectional symmetry-breaking modes of a rectilinear bluff body wake. We demonstrate the validity of the model and its Reynolds number independence through time-resolved base pressure measurements of the natural wake. Further, oscillating ﬂaps are used to investigate the dynamics and time scales of the instability associated with the ﬂipping process, demonstrating that they are largely independent of Reynolds number. The modelling approach is then used to design a feedback controller that uses the ﬂaps to suppress the symmetry-breaking modes. The controller is successful, leading to a suppression of the bistability of the wake, with concomitant reductions in both lateral and streamwise forces. Importantly, the controller is found to be efﬁcient, the actuator requiring only 24 \% of the aerodynamic power saving. The controller therefore provides a key demonstration of efﬁcient feedback control used to reduce the drag of a high-Reynolds-number three-dimensional bluff body. Furthermore, the results suggest that suppression of large-scale structures is a fundamentally efﬁcient approach for bluff body drag reduction.},

The flow is studied both qualitatively by means of laser tomoscopy and oil-flow visualizations and quantitatively by means of particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements. In particular, the results show a mean flow asymmetry. A sensitivity study around zero degree sideslip has shown that the flow is bistable for this geometry. This bistability has been observed in two different wind tunnels for very different upstream conditions.

The wake randomly undergoes symmetry-breaking reversals between two mirror asymmetric steady modes [reflectional symmetry-breaking (RSB) modes]. The characteristic time for reversals is about 2 or 3 orders of magnitude larger than the natural time for vortex shedding. Studying the effects of the proximity of a ground wall together with the Reynolds number, it is shown that the bimodal behavior is the result of an imperfect pitchfork bifurcation. The RSB modes correspond to the two stable bifurcated branches resulting from an instability of the stable symmetric wake. An attempt to stabilize the unstable symmetric wake is investigated using a passive control technique. Although the controlled wake still exhibits strong fluctuations, the bimodal behavior is suppressed and the drag reduced. This promising experiment indicates the possible existence of an unstable solution branch corresponding to a reflectional symmetry preserved (RSP) mode. This work is encouraging to develop a control strategy based on a stabilization of this RSP mode to reduce mean drag and lateral force fluctuations.},

	abstract = {A cavity at the base of the squareback Ahmed model at Re≃4×105 is able to reduce the base suction by 18\% and the drag coefficient by 9\%, while the flow at the separation remains unaffected. Instantaneous pressure measurements at the body base, fluid force measurements and wake velocity measurements are investigated varying the cavity depth from 0\% to 35\% of the base height. Due to the reflectional symmetry of the rectangular base, there are two Reflectional Symmetry Breaking (RSB) mirror modes present in the natural wake that switch from one to the other randomly in accordance with the recent findings of Grandemange et al. (2013b). It is shown that these modes exhibit an energetic 3D static vortex system close to the base of the body. A sufficiently deep cavity is able to stabilize the wake toward a symmetry preserved wake, thus suppressing the RSB modes and leading to a weaker elliptical toric recirculation. The stabilization can be modelled with a Langevin equation. The plausible mechanism for drag reduction with the base cavity is based on the interaction of the static 3D vortex system of the RSB modes with the base and their suppression by stabilization. There are some strong evidences that this mechanism may be generalized to axisymmetric bodies with base cavity.
•Static symmetry breaking mode consists in an energetic 3D asymmetric vortex system.•The static 3D vortex system is responsible for a low pressure at the base.•Small cavity reduces the 3D vortex system interaction with the base.•Large cavity produces a symmetry preserved wake.},

, the recirculation region shifts between two preferred reflectional-symmetry-breaking positions leading to a statistically symmetric wake; the sequence of these asymmetric states is random. This bi-stable behaviour is independent of the Reynolds number but occurs only above a critical value of ground clearance. At short time scales
\$\{T\}\_\{s\} {\textbackslash}sim 5H/ \{U\}\_\{0\} \$
, the wake presents weak coherent oscillations in the vertical and lateral directions. They are respectively associated with the interaction of the top/bottom and lateral shear layers; when normalized by the height and width of the body, the Strouhal numbers are close to 0.17. These results suggest an alternate shedding associated with the vertical oscillation and a one-sided vortex shedding in the lateral direction with an orientation linked to the current asymmetric position. Finally, the impact of these coherent wake motions on the base pressure is discussed to motivate further drag reduction strategies.},

As a follow-up study, we investigate the same AFC problem at an intermediate Reynolds number, i.e., Re = 1000, where the weak turbulence in the flow poses great challenges to the control. The results show that the DRL agent can still find effective control strategies, but requires much more episodes in the learning. A remarkable drag reduction of around 30\% is achieved, which is accompanied by elongation of the recirculation bubble and reduction of turbulent fluctuations in the cylinder wake. Furthermore, we also perform a sensitivity analysis on the learnt control strategies to explore the optimal layout of sensor network. To our best knowledge, this study is the first successful application of DRL to AFC in weakly turbulent conditions. It therefore sets a new milestone in progressing toward AFC in strong turbulent flows.},

	abstract = {Fish in schooling formations navigate complex flow-fields replete with mechanical energy in the vortex wakes of their companions. Their schooling behaviour has been associated with evolutionary advantages including collective energy savings. How fish harvest energy from their complex fluid environment and the underlying physical mechanisms governing energy-extraction during collective swimming, is still unknown. Here we show that fish can improve their sustained propulsive efficiency by actively following, and judiciously intercepting, vortices in the wake of other swimmers. This swimming strategy leads to collective energy-savings and is revealed through the first ever combination of deep reinforcement learning with high-fidelity flow simulations. We find that a `smart-swimmer' can adapt its position and body deformation to synchronise with the momentum of the oncoming vortices, improving its average swimming-efficiency at no cost to the leader. The results show that fish may harvest energy deposited in vortices produced by their peers, and support the conjecture that swimming in formation is energetically advantageous. Moreover, this study demonstrates that deep reinforcement learning can produce navigation algorithms for complex flow-fields, with promising implications for energy savings in autonomous robotic swarms.},

More precisely, the proximal policy optimization (PPO) method is used to control the mass flow rate of four synthetic jets symmetrically located on the upper and lower sides of a cylinder immersed in a two-dimensional flow domain. The learning environment supports four flow configurations with Reynolds numbers 100, 200, 300, and 400, respectively. A new smoothing interpolation function is proposed to help the PPO algorithm learn to set continuous actions, which is of great importance to effectively suppress problematic jumps in lift and allow a better convergence for the training process. It is shown that the DRL controller is able to significantly reduce the lift and drag fluctuations and actively reduce the drag by {\textasciitilde}5.7\%, 21.6\%, 32.7\%, and 38.7\%, at Re = 100, 200, 300, and 400, respectively. More importantly, it can also effectively reduce drag for any previously unseen value of the Reynolds number between 60 and 400. This highlights the generalization ability of deep neural networks and is an important milestone toward the development of practical applications of DRL to active flow control.},

Specifically, we aimed to maximize the power gain efficiency by properly selecting the rotational speed of two small cylinders, located parallel to and downstream of the main cylinder. By properly defining rewards and designing noise reduction techniques, and after an automatic sequence of tens of towing experiments, the RL agent was shown to discover a control strategy that is comparable to the optimal strategy found through lengthy systematically planned control experiments. Subsequently, these results were verified by simulations that enabled us to gain insight into the physical mechanisms of the drag reduction process. While RL has been used effectively previously in idealized computer flow simulation studies, this study demonstrates its effectiveness in experimental fluid mechanics and verifies it by simulations, potentially paving the way for efficient exploration of additional active flow control strategies in other complex fluid mechanics applications.},

	abstract = {Policy learning for partially observed control tasks requires policies that can remember salient information from past observations. In this paper, we present a method for learning policies with internal memory for high-dimensional, continuous systems, such as robotic manipulators. Our approach consists of augmenting the state and action space of the system with continuous-valued memory states that the policy can read from and write to. Learning general-purpose policies with this type of memory representation directly is difficult, because the policy must automatically figure out the most salient information to memorize at each time step. We show that, by decomposing this policy search problem into a trajectory optimization phase and a supervised learning phase through a method called guided policy search, we can acquire policies with effective memorization and recall strategies. Intuitively, the trajectory optimization phase chooses the values of the memory states that will make it easier for the policy to produce the right action in future states, while the supervised learning phase encourages the policy to use memorization actions to produce those memory states. We evaluate our method on tasks involving continuous control in manipulation and navigation settings, and show that our method can learn complex policies that successfully complete a range of tasks that require memory.  2016 IEEE.},

Stochastic optimization and flow simulations have identified escape patterns that are consistent with those observed in natural larval swimmers. However, these patterns have been limited by the specification of a particular cost function and depend on a prescribed functional form of the body motion. Here, we deploy reinforcement learning to discover swimmer escape patterns for larval fish under energy constraints. The identified patterns include the C-start mechanism, in addition to more energetically efficient escapes. We find that maximizing distance with limited energy requires swimming via short bursts of accelerating motion interlinked with phases of gliding. The present, data efficient, reinforcement learning algorithm results in an array of patterns that reveal practical flow optimization principles for efficient swimming and the methodology can be transferred to the control of aquatic robotic devices operating under energy constraints.  2021 American Physical Society.},

These include the short-term integration of information from noisy sensors and the identification of system parameters, as well as long-term memory problems that require preserving information over many time steps.

Three major improvements are introduced in our RDPG based learning framework: tail-step bootstrap of temporal difference, initialisation of hidden state using past subtrajectory, truncation of temporal backpropagation, and injection of external experiences learned by other agents. The proposed learning framework was implemented to solve the Bipedal-Walker challenge in OpenAI's gym simulation environment where only partial state information is available.

	abstract = {Experience replay (ER) is crucial for attaining high data-efficiency in off-policy deep reinforcement learning (RL). ER entails the recall of experiences obtained in past iterations to compute gradient estimates for the current policy. However, the accuracy of such updates may deteriorate when the policy diverges from past behaviors. Remedies that aim to abate policy changes, such as target networks and hyper-parameter tuning, do not prevent the policy from becoming disconnected from past experiences, possibly undermining the effectiveness of ER. We introduce an algorithm that relies on systematic Remembering and Forgetting for ER (ReF-ER). In ReF-ER the RL agents forget experiences that would be too unlikely with the current policy and constrain policy changes within a trust region of past behaviors in the replay memory. We show that ReF-ER improves the reliability and performance of off-policy RL, both in the deterministic and in the stochastic policy gradients settings. Finally, we complement ReF-ER with a novel off-policy actor-critic algorithm (RACER) for continuous-action control problems. RACER employs a computationally efficient closed-form approximation of on-policy action values and is shown to be highly competitive with state-of-the-art algorithms on benchmark problems, while being robust to large hyper-parameter variations.},

each situation based on the feedback provided by a reward signal which encourages drag reduction.
In this way, the controller learns an strategy which makes it capable of reducing the unsteady
drag on a square cylinder by a 74.7\%. To study the robustness of the controller trained on a

As a follow-up study, we investigate the same AFC problem at an intermediate Reynolds number, i.e., Re = 1000, where the weak turbulence in the flow poses great challenges to the control. The results show that the DRL agent can still find effective control strategies, but requires much more episodes in the learning. A remarkable drag reduction of around 30\% is achieved, which is accompanied by elongation of the recirculation bubble and reduction of turbulent fluctuations in the cylinder wake. Furthermore, we also perform a sensitivity analysis on the learnt control strategies to explore the optimal layout of sensor network. To our best knowledge, this study is the first successful application of DRL to AFC in weakly turbulent conditions. It therefore sets a new milestone in progressing toward AFC in strong turbulent flows.},

	abstract = {We propose deep distributed recurrent Q-networks (DDRQN), which enable teams of agents to learn to solve communication-based coordination tasks. In these tasks, the agents are not given any pre-designed communication protocol. Therefore, in order to successfully communicate, they must first automatically develop and agree upon their own communication protocol. We present empirical results on two multi-agent learning problems based on well-known riddles, demonstrating that DDRQN can successfully solve such tasks and discover elegant communication protocols to do so. To our knowledge, this is the first time deep reinforcement learning has succeeded in learning communication protocols. In addition, we present ablation experiments that confirm that each of the main components of the DDRQN architecture are critical to its success.},

	abstract = {We propose a new family of policy gradient methods for reinforcement learning, which alternate between sampling data through interaction with the environment, and optimizing a "surrogate" objective function using stochastic gradient ascent. Whereas standard policy gradient methods perform one gradient update per data sample, we propose a novel objective function that enables multiple epochs of minibatch updates. The new methods, which we call proximal policy optimization (PPO), have some of the benefits of trust region policy optimization (TRPO), but they are much simpler to implement, more general, and have better sample complexity (empirically). Our experiments test PPO on a collection of benchmark tasks, including simulated robotic locomotion and Atari game playing, and we show that PPO outperforms other online policy gradient methods, and overall strikes a favorable balance between sample complexity, simplicity, and wall-time.},

Different from previous studies, which initiated Q-learning with zero or random Q values, this study initiates the Q-learning with different supervisory controls, and the detailed analysis is given. The results show that the proposed warm-start Q-learning requires 68.8\% fewer iterations than cold-start Q-learning and improves 10\%-16\% MPG compared with equivalent consumption minimization strategy control.

	abstract = {Much recent research has been devoted to learning algorithms for deep architectures such as Deep Belief Networks and stacks of auto-encoder   variants with impressive results being obtained in several areas, mostly   on vision and language datasets.  The best results obtained on supervised   learning tasks often involve an unsupervised learning component, usually   in an unsupervised pre-training phase. The main question investigated   here is the following: why does unsupervised pre-training work so well?   Through extensive experimentation, we explore several possible   explanations discussed in the literature including its action as a   regularizer (Erhan et al. 2009) and as an aid to optimization   (Bengio et al. 2007).  Our results build on the work of   Erhan et al. 2009, showing that unsupervised pre-training appears to   play predominantly a regularization role in subsequent supervised   training. However our results in an online setting, with a virtually unlimited   data stream, point to a somewhat more nuanced interpretation of the roles   of optimization and regularization in the unsupervised pre-training   effect.},

	abstract = {In many real-world deployments of machine learning systems, data arrive piecemeal. These learning scenarios may be passive, where data arrive incrementally due to structural properties of the problem (e.g., daily financial data) or active, where samples are selected according to a measure of their quality (e.g., experimental design). In both of these cases, we are building a sequence of models that incorporate an increasing amount of data. We would like each of these models in the sequence to be performant and take advantage of all the data that are available to that point. Conventional intuition suggests that when solving a sequence of related optimization problems of this form, it should be possible to initialize using the solution of the previous iterate---to warm start'' the optimization rather than initialize from scratch---and see reductions in wall-clock time. However, in practice this warm-starting seems to yield poorer generalization performance than models that have fresh random initializations, even though the final training losses are similar. While it appears that some hyperparameter settings allow a practitioner to close this generalization gap, they seem to only do so in regimes that damage the wall-clock gains of the warm start. Nevertheless, it is highly desirable to be able to warm-start neural network training, as it would dramatically reduce the resource usage associated with the construction of performant deep learning systems. In this work, we take a closer look at this empirical phenomenon and try to understand when and how it occurs. We also provide a surprisingly simple trick that overcomes this pathology in several important situations, and present experiments that elucidate some of its properties.},

	abstract = {Deep learning algorithms seek to exploit the unknown structure in the input distribution in order to discover good representations, often at multiple levels, with higher-level learned features defined in terms of lower-level features. The objective is to make these higher-level representations more abstract, with their individual features more invariant to most of the variations that are typically present in the training distribution, while collectively preserving as much as possible of the information in the input. Ideally, we would like these representations to disentangle the unknown factors of variation that underlie the training distribution. Such unsupervised learning of representations can be exploited usefully under the hypothesis that the input distribution P(x)P(x)P(x) is structurally related to some task of interest, say predicting P(y{\textbar}x)P(y{\textbar}x)P(y{\textbar}x). This paper focuses on the context of the Unsupervised and Transfer Learning Challenge, on why unsupervised pre-training of representations can be useful, and how it can be exploited in the transfer learning scenario, where we care about predictions on examples that are not from the same distribution as the training distribution.},
