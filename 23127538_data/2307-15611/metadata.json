  "abstract": "Packet loss is a major cause of voice quality degradation in VoIP transmissions with serious impact on intelligibility and user experience. This paper describes a system based on a generative adversarial approach, which aims to repair the lost fragments during the transmission of audio streams. Inspired by the powerful image-to-image translation capability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), we propose bin2bin, an improved pix2pix framework to achieve the translation task from magnitude spectrograms of audio frames with lost packets, to noncorrupted speech spectrograms. In order to better maintain the structural information after spectrogram translation, this paper introduces the combination of two STFT-based loss functions, mixed with the traditional GAN objective. Furthermore, we employ a modified PatchGAN structure as discriminator and we lower the concealment time by a proper initialization of the phase reconstruction algorithm. Experimental results show that the proposed method has obvious advantages when compared with the current state-of-the-art methods, as it can better handle both high packet loss rates and large gaps.",
