It is necessary to understand the battery behavior and performance during charge and discharge cycles. An accurate model of a battery with a specific application is needed for an appropriate analysis and simulation. Therefore, in the field of battery modeling, various models have been proposed. This paper presents an overview of several electrical battery models. These models are classified into six categories. The parameter details of a battery model will not be computed but a brief description of them is given. Furthermore, the applications of each model are discussed.

abstract = {In this paper, distributed energy storage (DES) devices, like batteries and ultra-capacitors, are used to alleviate detrimental impacts of high penetration photovoltaic (PV) resources on distribution systems. The impacts are studied at mainly two time resolutions - one minute and one hour. To determine accurately the size of the required DES for the purpose of mitigating the impacts of large-scale distributed PV, sizing procedures based on OpenDSS are proposed. After determining the total size of the required DES, optimization techniques can be used to choose the optimal locations for the DES along the feeder, which is a continuous optimization problem taking into account equality constraints of the AC power flow. The continuity of the problem and the radial network structure make it possible to apply a convex optimization technique called second order cone programming (SOCP) relaxation to obtain the globally optimal solution and avoid the problem of NP-hardness. The exactness of the introduced SOCP relaxation is sensitive to the chosen objective function and additional quadratic equalities. The necessary and sufficient condition of exactness for the SOCP relaxation of the DES optimal allocation and operation in radial distribution systems is studied. The proposed methods are applied to an actual feeder in the southwestern US with high penetration of PV using actual measured data. The simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approaches.},

	abstract = {Climate and energy targets, as well as decreasing costs have been leading to a growing utilization of solar photovoltaic generation in residential buildings. However, even in buildings with the same level of yearly generation and consumption the mismatch between the demand and photovoltaic generation profiles leads to large power flows between the household and the grid. Such situation creates problems to the electrical grid management and can be a source of economic losses to the end-user. This paper presents an energy storage system designed in the context of residential buildings with photovoltaic generation. The objective of such system is to increase the matching between the local generation and consumption, as well as to decease the energy bill, using lithium-ion batteries as a storage device. Such system was modelled and simulated using real data of solar radiation and energy consumption from a typical residential household in Coimbra (Portugal). The results show that the designed system was able to reduce the energy sent to and consumed from the grid in 76{\%} and in 78.3{\%}, respectively, as well as the energy bill in 87.2{\%}.},

	abstract = {Many efforts are recently being dedicated to developing models that seek to provide insights into the techno-economic benefits of battery storage coupled to photovoltaic (PV) generation system. However, not all models consider the operation of the PV – battery storage system with a feed-in tariff (FiT) incentive, different electricity rates and battery storage unit cost. An electricity customer whose electricity demand is supplied by a grid connected PV generation system benefiting from a FiT incentive is simulated in this paper. The system is simulated with the PV modelled as an existing system and the PV modelled as a new system. For a better understanding of the existing PV system with battery storage operation, an optimisation problem was formulated which resulted in a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The optimisation model was developed to solve the MILP problem and to analyse the benefits considering different electricity tariffs and battery storage in maximising FiT revenue streams for the existing PV generating system. Real data from a typical residential solar PV owner is used to study the benefit of the battery storage system using half-hourly dataset for a complete year. A sensitivity analysis of the MILP optimisation model was simulated to evaluate the impact of battery storage capacity (kWh) on the objective function. In the second case study, the electricity demand data, solar irradiance, tariff and battery unit cost were used to analyse the effect of battery storage unit cost on the adoption of electricity storage in maximising FiT revenue. In this case, the PV is simulated as a new system using Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model (DER-CAM) software tool while modifying the optimisation formulation to include the PV onsite generation and export tariff incentive. The results provide insights on the benefit of battery storage for existing and new PV system benefiting from FiT incentives and under time-varying electricity tariffs.},

	abstract = {Many countries introduced subsidy schemes that were successful in incentivising investments into residential solar PV. The resulting growth of the global PV market was accompanied by cost reductions for PV systems, reductions of PV subsidies and, often, increasing electricity retail prices. Along with decreasing costs for battery storages, these developments made self-consumption and self-sufficiency continuously more attractive. However, the profitability of PV-storage systems depends on many factors, including technological, political and geographical aspects. We present a simulation model to identify the most profitable sizes of PV and storage systems from a household perspective and explore what drives the profitability of self-consumption and self-sufficiency. We compare and contrast Germany and Ireland to account for regulatory and geographical differences. Our results show that PV-storage systems are generally profitable in Germany and that, after minor technology cost reductions, this result holds even in the absence of subsidies. In Ireland, such systems are not yet profitable but this may change soon with expected technology costs reductions. The share of electricity demand that will be required from the grid may be reduced to 25–35{\%}. Implications for the electricity retail business and policy makers are discussed including distributional concerns and system efficiency considerations.},

	abstract = {The optimum sizing ratio of the photovoltaic (PV) array capacity, compared to the nominal inverter input capacity, was determined in grid-connected PV (GCPV) systems from two points of view: energetic and economic. The optimum ratio was determined by both empirical and analytical approaches, and based on two PV arrays connected to their inverters, plus three simulated inverters. The flatness of the optimum-energy region due to the inverter characteristics was decreased when economic factors were taken into account. The energetic and economic optimum sizing intervals were defined as the sizing regions causing less than 1{\%} losses from their corresponding optimum points. Subsequently, a compound optimum sizing interval was proposed to maximise the energy injected to the grid and minimise economic costs simultaneously. The results showed that the GCPV system with lower specific DC power generation (kWDC/kWp) and inverter/module cost ratio presented a wider interval (1.12–1.25) than the interval (1.17–1.19) of the system with higher specific DC power generation and cost ratio, for all the analysed inverters. Finally, the optimum sizing ratio was completed by considering a PV module degradation rate of 1{\%}/year, which resulted in a 10{\%} increase in the optimum sizing ratio for a 20-year lifetime.},

	abstract = {This paper investigates the business case of power storage attached to PV generation from the perspective of an aggregator trading power on wholesale markets and possibly supplying household customers. The profitability and an optimum storage configuration are determined for two European regions: Baden-Wuerttemberg in Germany and Puglia in Italy based on wholesale price data and solar irradiation data for the years 2007-2011. During this period of time and under the assumptions made, adding storage to a portfolio of PV generators would not have constituted a business case for Baden-Wuerttemberg while profitability could have been reached for Puglia. However, the return of PV-attached storage that could have been achieved in Puglia during the years 2007-2011 is below levels typically required by companies operating on wholesale markets (deregulated power generators or traders) as those market participants' capital costs are usually significantly higher than borrowing costs of the state. Storage proved to be financially more attractive in cases where severe grid constraints lead to significant levels of curtailment provided that the associated losses would not be financially compensated. This could pose a risk to any investor as grid upgrades would eventually erode the revenues. Restricting the storage to PV energy only (i.e. without the possibility to do arbitrage on markets) depresses the business case and is generally unprofitable, except but for situations of severe grid bottlenecks. The picture does not change significantly if a consumption portfolio is added. In order to reach profitability, the energy related CAPEX will have to fall to a range of 100-150. €/kW. h. The optimal storage configuration depends on its usage and does not exceed 5. h of discharge at full power with the discharging power limited to 40{\%} of the nominal PV capacity. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Many efforts are recently being dedicated to developing models that seek to provide insights into the techno-economic benefits of battery storage coupled to photovoltaic (PV) generation system. However, not all models consider the operation of the PV – battery storage system with a feed-in tariff (FiT) incentive, different electricity rates and battery storage unit cost. An electricity customer whose electricity demand is supplied by a grid connected PV generation system benefiting from a FiT incentive is simulated in this paper. The system is simulated with the PV modelled as an existing system and the PV modelled as a new system. For a better understanding of the existing PV system with battery storage operation, an optimisation problem was formulated which resulted in a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The optimisation model was developed to solve the MILP problem and to analyse the benefits considering different electricity tariffs and battery storage in maximising FiT revenue streams for the existing PV generating system. Real data from a typical residential solar PV owner is used to study the benefit of the battery storage system using half-hourly dataset for a complete year. A sensitivity analysis of the MILP optimisation model was simulated to evaluate the impact of battery storage capacity (kWh) on the objective function. In the second case study, the electricity demand data, solar irradiance, tariff and battery unit cost were used to analyse the effect of battery storage unit cost on the adoption of electricity storage in maximising FiT revenue. In this case, the PV is simulated as a new system using Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model (DER-CAM) software tool while modifying the optimisation formulation to include the PV onsite generation and export tariff incentive. The results provide insights on the benefit of battery storage for existing and new PV system benefiting from FiT incentives and under time-varying electricity tariffs.},

	abstract = {Direct current (DC) power distribution has recently gained traction in buildings research due to the proliferation of on-site electricity generation and battery storage, and an increasing prevalence of internal DC loads. The research discussed in this paper uses Modelica-based simulation to compare the efficiency of DC building power distribution with an equivalent alternating current (AC) distribution. The buildings are all modeled with solar generation, battery storage, and loads that are representative of the most efficient building technology. A variety of parametric simulations determine how and when DC distribution proves advantageous. These simulations also validate previous studies that use simpler approaches and arithmetic efficiency models. This work shows that using DC distribution can be considerably more efficient: a medium sized office building using DC distribution has an expected baseline of 12{\%} savings, but may also save up to 18{\%}. In these results, the baseline simulation parameters are for a zero net energy (ZNE) building that can island as a microgrid. DC is most advantageous in buildings with large solar capacity, large battery capacity, and high voltage distribution.},

	abstract = {We develop a new convex optimization (CO)-based charge/discharge scheduling algorithm for distributed energy storage systems (ESSs) co-located with solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. The CO-based scheduling algorithm minimizes the monthly electricity expenses of a customer who owns an ESS and incorporates both a time-of-use volumetric tariff and a demand charge tariff. Further, we propose the novel idea of a “supply charge” tariff that incentivizes ESS customers to store excess solar PV generation that may otherwise result in reverse power flow in the distribution grid. By means of a case study we observe the CO-based daily charge/discharge schedules reduce (1) peak net demand (that is, load minus PV generation) of the customer, (2) power fluctuations in the customer net demand profile, and (3) the reliance of the customer on the grid by way of promoting energy self-consumption of local solar PV generation. Two alternate methods for behind-the-meter ESS scheduling are considered as benchmarks for cost minimization, peak net demand reduction, and mitigation of net demand fluctuations. The algorithm is tested using real 30-min interval residential load and solar data of 53 customers over 2-years. Results show that the CO-based scheduling algorithm provides mean peak net demand reductions between 46{\%} and 64{\%}, reduces mean net demand fluctuations by 25–49{\%}, and increases the mean solar PV self-consumption between 24{\%} and 39{\%} when compared to a customer without an ESS. Introduction of a supply charge reduces the maximum solar PV power supply to the grid by 19{\%} on average and does not financially impact ESS owners.},

	abstract = {With the environmental advantages of solar energy, the use of solar photovoltaic (PV) in residential electricity generation is encouraged by Australian governments incentives, however, what number of residents benefit from installing a grid-connected PV system and how much electricity generated by such a system is not clearly understood yet. This study aims to investigate the economic, technical and environmental performance of residential PV system running under the Queensland (Australia) climatic conditions, and optimize the size and slope of PV array in the system. The solar irradiation data of the 4 typical climate zones of Queensland, including tropical, sub-tropical, hot arid, and warm temperature zone, are investigated. Using global solar irradiation as solar energy resource data, the price of PV devices, batteries, converters, and grid electricity tariff and sale-back tariff as economic analysis inputs, the system is simulated and optimized by HOMER software. The optimized system not only satisfies the typical residential load of 23 kWh per day but also meets the requirement of minimizing the total costs of system investment and electricity consumption during the system's lifetime. It is found that under the specific climatic conditions of the eleven main cities of Queensland, a PV system is an effective way to decrease electricity bills and mitigate carbon dioxide emission. In particular, a 6 kW PV system in Townsville is able to deal with 61{\%} of the total electricity load and conserves more than 90{\%} of electricity payments and reduce approximately 95{\%} of carbon dioxide emission. It is also found that for all the cities the systems with 20-25 degrees of slope have the best performance including the least cost of energy (COE) and the least carbon dioxide emission. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel convex modeling approach which allows for a simultaneous optimization of battery size and energy management of a plug-in hybrid powertrain by solving a semidefinite convex problem. The studied powertrain belongs to a city bus which is driven along a perfectly known bus line with fixed charging infrastructure. The purpose of the paper is to present the convexifying methodology and validate the necessary approximations by comparing with results obtained by Dynamic Programming when using the original nonlinear, non-convex, mixed-integer models. The comparison clearly shows the importance of the gear and engine on/off decisions, and it also shows that the convex optimization and Dynamic Programming point toward similar battery size and operating cost when the same gear and engine on/off heuristics are used. The main conclusion in the paper is that due to the low computation time, the convex modeling approach enables optimization of problems with two or more state variables, e.g. allowing for thermal models of the components; or to include more sizing variables, e.g. sizing of the engine and the electric machine simultaneously. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

	abstract = {The new German Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG) for the year 2009 provides a new tariff option: self-consumption (EEG {\S}33,2). By economically favouring the local consumption of PV energy, the EEG incentivises the owners of PV systems to either shift their consumption to the time of production by load management or use storage options. Massive deployment of such energy management approaches may reduce the impact of PV energy in the grid and thus pave the way for a further rise of the number of installations. For maximizing locally consumed PV energy, a storage system based on lithium-ion batteries is developed in the French- German project Sol-ion. Fraunhofer IWES, INES, ISEA and ZSW developed models to analyse the energy flows in residential PV-battery systems installed in Germany and in France. The models are used to calculate the increase of PV self-consumption. Energy flow simulations show that PV battery systems as developed in the Sol-ion project increase the local consumption of PV energy at the point of common coupling without constraining the user in his consumption habits. Target battery costs were calculated in an economical assessment. The installation of a Sol-ion system will become economically interesting with specific battery costs below 350 €/kWh as expected by the manufacturers in the medium term. The integration of additional functionalities (e.g. backup power and grid support) can improve the benefit of the Sol-ion system significantly.},

	abstract = {Increasing the self-consumption of photovoltaic (PV) power is an important aspect to integrate more PV power in the power system. The profit for the PV system owner can increase and the stress on the power grid can be reduced. Previous research in the field has focused on either self-consumption of PV power in individual buildings or PV power curtailment for voltage control. In this paper self-consumption of residential PV power in a community of several single-family houses was investigated using high-resolution irradiance and power consumption data. Cases with individual or shared battery energy storages for the houses were examined. PV power curtailment was investigated as a method to reduce feed-in power to the grid, i.e. peak shaving. Results indicated that the self-consumption ratio increased when using shared instead of individual storage. Reducing the feed-in power from the community by almost 50{\%} only led to maximum 7{\%} yearly production losses due to curtailment and storage losses. The economics for shared storage are slightly better than for individual ones. These results suggest that residential PV-battery systems should use (i) shared energy storage options if local regulations allow it and (ii) PV power curtailment if there are incentives to lower the feed-in power.},

	abstract = {Rising levels of local distributed generation and storage by residential grid users are difficult to integrate into the (energy-based) grid tariffs which are used in several European countries. There are proposals to address this issue, for instance, through capacity-based tariffs. Yet, this can lead to many possible designs which have to be compared. An important aspect of the comparison is the user reaction to the tariff. Tariffs are ex-ante options to use the grid. Grid-users react to this. The actual suitability of a tariff design is only measurable after the reaction. In this paper, a framework to assess tariffs in the context of a reaction through self-generation is designed and implemented. At first, a list of efficiency measures for the comparison is formalized. Then, a simulation model framework to quantify the measures is developed. This framework focuses on the interaction of tariff and self-generation using photovoltaic generation and battery storage. As a case study, different tariff schemes are implemented. The case study outlines the importance of considering the user reaction by showing the extent of the interaction. Also, it provides indications for tariff design by showing the effects on grid upgrade costs related to certain tariff components.},

The main component of the modular and flexible software-tool is an abstract approach to the energy storage model, which allows the variation of different storage technologies and technical sub-components. Furthermore, stress characterization enables the estimation of the energy storage device's degradation. Various aging models can be used for this purpose, whereby detailed models based on aging experiments especially for batteries are currently developed at the EES Institute. In order to optimize the utilization of the energy storage in the different applications, a large number of operating strategies are implemented. Time series simulations allow for technical evaluations and calculation of relevant key figures. Furthermore, economic key performance indicators are derived and enable the assessment and comparison of the simulation results.

	abstract = {a b s t r a c t A linear programming (LP) routine was implemented to model optimal energy storage dispatch sched-ules for peak net load management and demand charge minimization in a grid-connected, combined photovoltaic-battery storage system (PVþ system). The LP leverages PV power output and load forecasts to minimize peak loads subject to elementary dynamical and electrical constraints of the PVþ system. Battery charge/discharge were simulated over a range of two PVþ system parameters (battery storage capacity and peak load reduction target) to obtain energy cost for a time-of-use pricing schedule and the net present value (NPV) of the battery storage system. The financial benefits of our optimized energy dispatch schedule were compared with basic off-peak charging/on-peak discharging and real-time load response dispatch strategies that did not use any forecast information. The NPV of the battery array increased significantly when the battery was operated on the optimized schedule compared to the off-peak/on-peak and real time dispatch schedules. These trends were attributed to increased battery life-time and reduced demand charges attained under the optimized dispatch strategy. Our results show that Lithium-ion batteries can be a financially viable energy storage solution in demand side, energy cost management applications at an installed cost of about {\$}400e{\$}500 per kW h (approximately 40e50{\%} of 2011 market prices).

	abstract = {Battery storage is generally considered an effective means for reducing the intermittency of electricity generated by solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. However, currently it remains unclear when and under which conditions battery storage can be profitably operated in residential PV systems without policy support. Based on a review of previous studies that have examined the economics of integrated PV-battery systems, in this paper we devise a simulation model that investigates the economic viability of battery storage for residential PV in Germany under eight different electricity price scenarios from 2013 to 2022. In contrast to previous forward-looking studies, we assume that no premium is paid for solar photovoltaic power and/or self-consumed electricity. Additionally, we run the model with a large number of different PV and storage capacities to determine the economically optimal configuration in terms of system size. We find that already in 2013 investments in storage solutions were economically viable for small PV systems. Given the assumptions of our model, the optimal size of both residential PV systems and battery storage rises significantly in the future. Higher electricity retail prices, lower electricity wholesale prices or limited access to the electricity wholesale market add to the profitability of storage. We conclude that additional policy incentives to foster investments in battery storage for residential PV in Germany will only be necessary in the short run. At the same time, the impending profitability of integrated PV-storage systems is likely to further spur the ongoing trend toward distributed electricity generation with major implications for the electricity sector.},

	abstract = {Electric energy storage is probably the first viable for households since they pay the highest electricity tariffs, being a factor four higher than bulk electricity prices. The attractiveness depends on the subsidy systems (if existing), the electricity price and the purchase cost of a PV installation and a battery system. Since the electricity price may not remain constant during the lifetime of the storage system, a financial cash flow calculation is needed including discount rate and inflation. In this research the optimal PV-battery system is determined as a function of the remuneration (discerning a subsidised region, a "market" price region and no fees at all), the investment year (2012, 2017 and 2021) and the electricity price increase rate (0{\%}, 4{\%}, 6{\%}) (including the general inflation rate). The analysis is based on available battery energy storage systems on the market and on real household measurement data. All these degrees of freedom secure the accuracy of the analysis. The article shows also the battery throughput cost with a direct comparison to the electricity cost. It becomes clear that batteries can already be cost-effective today without subsidies and irrespective of the electricity price increase, but without a return on investment if the electricity price does not increase more than the inflation. An investor cannot recommend batteries today. However, if the electricity price increases with 4{\%} than batteries become quickly attractive and do not need subsidies. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

Whatever the application the storage is used for, the primary concern of the system owner is to maximize the profits. Therefore, this paper addresses an energy management system for a PV system coupled with battery energy storage, which maximizes the daily economic benefits while curtailing the power injection to the grid in such a way that helps to mitigate over-voltage problems caused by reverse power flow. A time dependent grid feed-in limit is proposed achieve this objective. The daily operational cost that includes the energy cost and the battery degradation cost is considered as the objective function. The non-linear constrained optimization problem is solved using dynamic programming. The analyses are made to investigate the economic benefits of charging the battery from the grid. It is found that there is a possibility for these systems for participating in load-levelling if batteries are charged from the PV system. In order for that to be feasible, the peak-hour sell-back price for the energy from storage should be higher than the off-peak utility electricity price.},

Hence aggregating the value delivered by storage to these sectors is paramount for promoting its efficient deployment in the near future, which will provide the level of flexibility needed to deal with the envisaged high renewables share and the increase in peak demand driven by transport and heating electrification. In this context, we develop a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model to schedule operation of distributed storage by coordinating provision of a range of system services which are rewarded at different market prices. The model maximises distributed storage's net profit while providing distribution network congestion management, energy price arbitrage and various reserve and frequency regulation services through both active and reactive power control. We demonstrate benefits associated with the coordination of these services and its impacts on commercial strategies to determine optimal multi-service portfolios in the long term. We also demonstrate the value of reactive power control to support not only distribution network congestion management, but also efficient trading of energy and balancing services which are usually treated through active power-only control. In addition, we use the model to price the service of distribution network congestion management and propose an efficient investment policy to upgrade distribution network capacity in the presence of distributed storage. Finally, several case studies under current market conditions in Great Britain (GB) demonstrate that distributed storage revenues associated with frequency control services are significantly more profitable.},

	abstract = {Dispersed storage systems (DSSs) can represent an important near-term solution for supporting the operation and control of active distribution networks (ADNs). Indeed, they have the capability to support ADNs by providing ancillary services in addition to energy balance capabilities. Within this context, this paper focuses on the optimal allocation of DSSs in ADNs by defining a multi-objective optimization problem aiming at finding the optimal trade-off between technical and economical goals. In particular, the proposed procedure accounts for: 1) network voltage deviations; 2) feeders/lines congestions; 3) network losses; 4) cost of supplying loads (from external grid or local producers) together with the cost of DSS investment/maintenance; 5) load curtailment; and 6) stochasticity of loads and renewables productions. The DSSs are suitably modeled to consider their ability to support the network by both active and reactive powers. A convex formulation of ac optimal power flow problem is used to define a mixed integer second-order cone programming problem to optimally site and size the DSSs in the network. A test case referring to IEEE 34 bus distribution test feeder is used to demonstrate and discuss the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Battery storage is generally considered an effective means for reducing the intermittency of electricity generated by solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. However, currently it remains unclear when and under which conditions battery storage can be profitably operated in residential PV systems without policy support. Based on a review of previous studies that have examined the economics of integrated PV-battery systems, in this paper we devise a simulation model that investigates the economic viability of battery storage for residential PV in Germany under eight different electricity price scenarios from 2013 to 2022. In contrast to previous forward-looking studies, we assume that no premium is paid for solar photovoltaic power and/or self-consumed electricity. Additionally, we run the model with a large number of different PV and storage capacities to determine the economically optimal configuration in terms of system size. We find that already in 2013 investments in storage solutions were economically viable for small PV systems. Given the assumptions of our model, the optimal size of both residential PV systems and battery storage rises significantly in the future. Higher electricity retail prices, lower electricity wholesale prices or limited access to the electricity wholesale market add to the profitability of storage. We conclude that additional policy incentives to foster investments in battery storage for residential PV in Germany will only be necessary in the short run. At the same time, the impending profitability of integrated PV-storage systems is likely to further spur the ongoing trend toward distributed electricity generation with major implications for the electricity sector. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {The optimal components design for grid-connected photovoltaic-battery systems should be determined with consideration of system operation. This study proposes a method to simultaneously optimize the battery capacity and rule-based operation strategy. The investigated photovoltaic-battery system is modeled using single diode photovoltaic model and Improved Shepherd battery model. Three rule-based operation strategies—including the conventional operation strategy, the dynamic price load shifting strategy, and the hybrid operation strategy—are designed and evaluated. The rule-based operation strategies introduce different operation parameters to run the system operation. multi-objective Genetic Algorithm is employed to optimize the decisional variables, including battery capacity and operation parameters, towards maximizing the system's Self Sufficiency Ratio and Net Present Value. The results indicate that employing battery with the conventional operation strategy is not profitable, although it increases Self Sufficiency Ratio. The dynamic price load shifting strategy has similar performance with the conventional operation strategy because the electricity price variation is not large enough. The proposed hybrid operation strategy outperforms other investigated strategies. When the battery capacity is lower than 72 kW h, Self Sufficiency Ratio and Net Present Value increase simultaneously with the battery capacity.},

@article{Brusco2016,
	abstract = {With reference to an integrated photovoltaic battery (PV-BES) system for grid-connected end users, a feed-in tariff scheme is discussed in this article. This scheme solely rewards self-consumption. Zero is the generation price paid for the generated renewable energy, and zero is the export price paid for the renewable energy delivered to the grid. This feed-in tariff scheme, referred to as S-FIT, also excludes the net-metering service and the possibility that the grid recharges or discharges the batteries. To calculate the incentive tariff, an optimization problem is adopted. The problem returns the minimum value of the tariff so that the subsidy given to the end user is equal to the difference between the instalments paid for the integrated PV-BES system and the savings obtained from the electricity bill. The period during which the end user has secured this grant is ten years. The S-FIT scheme is applied to the case of the Italian Public Administration from 2011 to 2015. Consequently, the real values of temperature, irradiation, and energy consumption are measured every 15 min, and the real electricity prices over the period 2011–2015 are considered. The optimal solution returned by the optimization problem allows for a significant reduction of the electricity bill by 49.56{\%}; moreover, the self-produced energy is equal to at least 50{\%}, whereas the self-consumed energy is equal to at least 80{\%}. The optimal solution that is calculated using 2011 data is applied for 2012–2015. Although the electricity prices were subject to a radical change during this period, the optimal solution still allows for a significant reduction of the electricity bill; in particular, this reduction is equal to 44.98{\%} when the PV-BES system is adopted, whereas it is equal to 33.65{\%} when only the PV system is adopted. In both cases, the optimal solution ensures self-produced energy of at least 50{\%} and self-consumed energy of at least 80{\%}. This article ends with an assessment of the impact of the integrated PV-BES system on the load profile from the grid perspective and the satisfactory degree of self-sufficiency achieved by the end user.},

This paper proposes a non-linear battery storage optimization model in the voltage, current, charge variable space. The battery voltage is conceived as an empirical function of both state-of-charge and charge current and represented through bi-variate cubic splines. The voltage source converter losses are also approximated with a cubic spline function. Compared to energy-based storage models, the results show that this approach enables safe operation closer to the battery voltage and current limits. Furthermore, it prefers operating around high state-of-charge due to the higher efficiency in that region.},

	abstract = {Many efforts are recently being dedicated to developing models that seek to provide insights into the techno-economic benefits of battery storage coupled to photovoltaic (PV) generation system. However, not all models consider the operation of the PV – battery storage system with a feed-in tariff (FiT) incentive, different electricity rates and battery storage unit cost. An electricity customer whose electricity demand is supplied by a grid connected PV generation system benefiting from a FiT incentive is simulated in this paper. The system is simulated with the PV modelled as an existing system and the PV modelled as a new system. For a better understanding of the existing PV system with battery storage operation, an optimisation problem was formulated which resulted in a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The optimisation model was developed to solve the MILP problem and to analyse the benefits considering different electricity tariffs and battery storage in maximising FiT revenue streams for the existing PV generating system. Real data from a typical residential solar PV owner is used to study the benefit of the battery storage system using half-hourly dataset for a complete year. A sensitivity analysis of the MILP optimisation model was simulated to evaluate the impact of battery storage capacity (kWh) on the objective function. In the second case study, the electricity demand data, solar irradiance, tariff and battery unit cost were used to analyse the effect of battery storage unit cost on the adoption of electricity storage in maximising FiT revenue. In this case, the PV is simulated as a new system using Distributed Energy Resources Customer Adoption Model (DER-CAM) software tool while modifying the optimisation formulation to include the PV onsite generation and export tariff incentive. The results provide insights on the benefit of battery storage for existing and new PV system benefiting from FiT incentives and under time-varying electricity tariffs.},

	abstract = {Battery energy storage devices coupled with photovoltaic (PV) systems have to react to the fluctuating nature of the PV output and electrical demand in residential buildings. However, the charging and discharging power cannot be adjusted to the power fluctuations without any time delay so that an inherent temporal mismatch between the battery power and the residual power (PV output minus load) occurs under dynamic conditions. This paper presents a simulation study analyzing the response time-induced mismatch losses of grid-connected PV-battery systems. Firstly, the response time issue is analyzed theoretically to reveal how the energy flows between the household and the grid are changed due to the delayed battery response. Then, measurements are presented to show the dynamic behavior of two different PV-battery systems. The experimental results reveal settling times of up to 7 s to reach the steady state after an abrupt step change in the load demand. Thirdly, simulations of an AC-coupled PV-battery system are carried out with a time step size of 1 s. A sensitivity analysis is conducted to identify the impact of the dynamic response on the annual amount of energy exchanged with the grid. It is found that longer response times are accomplished by an increase in the grid feed-in and grid supply as well. Consequently, a slow-reacting battery system diminishes the economic benefit for the owner of the PV-battery system. In order to improve the transparency from the end-customeŕs point of view, response time-related specifications should be stated in the data sheets of the products in the future.},
