	abstract = {Rough surfaces are ubiquitous in nature. Near-surface processes both encounter and create surface roughness. Recent advances in surveying have improved the resolution, extent and availability of topographic datasets. This broad review synthesises efforts to represent surface roughness in such datasets, drawing examples from a number of branches of Earth Science, with the aim of facilitating a more systematic exchange of roughness formulations. A number of issues surround the deﬁnition of roughness. The term ‘roughness’ has been applied variously to represent a property of a surface, a property of a ﬂow and as a model tuning parameter; yet these distinctions are articulated rarely. There has been a proliferation of methods of quantifying surface roughness. Given the wide range of applications of roughness in the Earth Sciences, attempts to create a standardised parameter set will likely be problematic. Yet a standard protocol for reporting roughness calculation would be appropriate, especially considering the importance of the choice of partition scale in the distinction between roughness and topography. Applications of surface roughness treat it as a variable (in the mapping of landforms, for example), a surrogate for less measurable variables (as in the estimation of resistance to ﬂows) or as an indicator of near-surface processes. Recent developments examining interactions between roughness elements (e.g. sheltering) highlight the need to consider the pattern of surface roughness (e.g. anisotropy, connectivity of peaks) if appropriate parameterisations are to be developed. Addressing these issues will maximise the exciting potential offered by advances in topographic surveys.},

Laboratory and ﬁeld measurements show that wind waves signiﬁcantly increase the gas transfer rate and that it is signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced in this way by surfactants. Because of limited experimental techniques, the mechanisms for this enhancement and the structure of the turbulence in the boundary layer at a wavy water surface are still not known.

First, the case of momentum is re-examined, and it is suggested that the momentum source (-dp/ax) can be important in some cases. An approximate solution to the equation describing the air concentration of particles is then found, using similar approximations found to be reasonable for momentum. The result is illustrated for different collection efficiencies, c,l, and then a specific, particle-size-dependent 8 is proposed based on windtunnel data obtained by Chamberlain. The results suggest that dry deposition velocities for 0.1-1.0 pm particles are typically about an order-of-magnitude smaller than values currently used in many air-quality models.},

Sandstorms, which are a common natural disaster, are mechanically characterized by a particle-laden two-phase ﬂow experiencing wall turbulence, with an extremely high Reynolds number and signiﬁcant turbulent kinetic energy. Turbulence energy transfer is important to the understanding of sandstorm dynamics. This study indicates that large-scale and very large-scale coherent structures originally exist in the rising stage of sandstorms with a streamwise kinetic energy of 75 \% (at z/δ = 0.2) rather than gradually forming. In addition to carrying a substantial portion of energy, the very large-scale motions are active structures with strong nonlinear energy transfer. These structures gain energy from strong nonlinear interaction. As a sandstorm evolves, these large structures are gradually broken by quadratic phase coupling, with the energy fraction reducing to 40 \% (at z/δ = 0.2) in the declining stage. The nonlinear process in the steady and declining stages weakens and maintains a balanced budget of energy. The systematic bispectrum results provide a new perspective for further insight into sandstorms.},

	abstract = {The interaction between heavy particles with high Stokes number (St) and the wall, known as the particle–wall (P–W) process, widely exists in natural and engineering two-phase ﬂows, whereas its effects on particle-laden ﬂows and the large-scale/very large-scale turbulent motions (VLSM) remain unclear. In this paper, two types of wind-blown sand-laden ﬂows were experimentally designed and investigated by keeping the same free stream velocity, ﬂow Reynolds number and particle St number. In the ﬁrst type, sand particles were directly blown from a sand bed at the bottom wall of the wind tunnel, and the P–W process occurred in the whole wall-normal region of the sand-laden ﬂow. In the second type, sand particles were released from a feeder at the top wall of wind tunnel, and the P–W process was only present in a lower wall-normal region. Simultaneous two-phase particle image/tracking velocimetry measurements were conducted for uncovering the characteristics of turbulent structures in the particle-laden turbulent boundary layers. The results conﬁrmed that the VLSM with streamwise scales exceeding 3δ (δ is boundary layer thickness) above a certain height exist in both types of the sand-laden ﬂows and could be signiﬁcantly affected by the P–W process. That is, in the region without the P–W process, the presence of sand particles can enlarge the VLSM, while in the region with the P–W process, the VLSM are substantially reduced in size or even destroyed. The reduction degree is found to be closely related to the strength of the P–W process.},

Here, we report on the impact and lift-off parameters of saltating particles in wind-blown sand predicted with Reynoldsaveraged Navier–Stokes (RANS) or large eddy simulation (LES) and the three-dimensional stochastic particle-bed collision model. Simulation results showed new phenomena, including: (a) a reduced mean impact velocity and an increased probability of lift-off velocities distribution at left extreme with increasing free stream velocity, and (b) two peaks of the impact angle distribution. These phenomena disappear when the statistical height is increased to five times the particle diameter, suggesting that the near-wall motions are not negligible. In addition, when turbulence is considered and wind velocity increases, the extreme value of velocity distribution increases, impact angle distribution shows a longer tail, and mean impact and lift-off parameters increase (except impact velocity). We conclude that new velocity distribution with near-wall motions and turbulence will significantly improve the prediction of aeolian transport flux.},

            Large-eddy simulation of a particle-laden flow over an erodible bed is performed to investigate the effect of heavy, saltating particles on turbulence modulation, using the Eulerian–Lagrangian point-particle approach with two-way coupling. The flow into which the solid particles are introduced is a turbulent open channel flow with particle-free friction Reynolds numbers of 3730 and 4200. The inter-particle collisions are not considered, whereas the particle-bed collisions are described by splashing models. Simulation results show that the addition of particles reduces the mean streamwise fluid velocity. The streamwise fluctuating velocity and Reynolds stress are damped while the vertical and spanwise turbulence intensities are enhanced in the near-bed region. The turbulence intensities and Reynolds stress in the outer layer are apparently increased. These effects become more pronounced as the Reynolds number increases. Correlation scales of the turbulence structures increase in the near-bed region and decrease in the outer region. The modulation mechanism of turbulence is revealed. That is, the range and degree of turbulence enhancement by ascending particles in the near-bed region are much larger than those of turbulence attenuation by descending particles, which results in the redistribution of turbulent kinetic energy from the streamwise to the spanwise and vertical directions. This effect extends to the outer region via saltating particles by forming ‘active’ roughness elements. The premultiplied energy spectra of the streamwise velocity show that the enhancement of outer turbulent kinetic energy by saltating particles occurs in a wide range of wavelengths from the intermediate to very large scale.},

	abstract = {Based on the high-quality observational data in the Qingtu Lake Observation Array (QLOA), the difference in the energy distribution, the scale of the coherent structures, and the amplitude modulation effect of the wall-normal velocity fluctuations between particle-free and particle-laden flow in the atmospheric surface layer are analyzed. The results show that the presence of particles enhanced the wall-normal turbulence intensity, especially the increase at the top of the logarithmic region is more significant though the particle mass loading decreases with the wall-normal distance. A further insight indicates that the increase in the length scale of the wall-normal fluctuating velocity coherent structure by particles is more significant further from the wall, which is supported by the premultiplied energy spectra and the two-point correlation. This leads to a drastic increase in kinetic energy of the large-scale coherent structures by the particle away from the wall and thus results in increased amplitude modulation effects of large-scale wall-normal velocity fluctuations onto small-scales.},

Important phenomena such as the pollen emission by the plants and the ground deposition are parameterized by the lower boundary condition. The numerical model is validated against previously published experiments of point source releases of glass beads and pollen grains in the atmospheric boundary layer. The numerical model is used together with experimental data of pollen emission and downwind deposition from a natural field obtained near Washington, DC, in the summer of 2006. The combined analysis of experimental and numerical data allows to elucidate the emission/transport/deposition process in considerable detail. In particular, the relative fractions of pollen deposited inside the source field and airborne at the edge of the field can be quantified. The use of LES allows quantification of important intermittent deposition events far from the source field.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Mineral dust is an important component of the climate system, affecting the
radiation balance, cloud properties, biogeochemical cycles, regional
circulation and precipitation, as well as having negative effects on
aviation, solar energy generation and human health. Dust size and composition
has an impact on all these processes. However, changes in dust size
distribution and composition during transport, particularly for coarse
particles, are poorly understood and poorly represented in climate models.
Here we present new in situ airborne observations of dust in the Saharan Air
Layer (SAL) and the marine boundary layer (MBL) at the beginning of its
transatlantic transport pathway, from the AERosol
Properties – Dust (AER-D) fieldwork in August 2015,
within the peak season of North African dust export. This study focuses on
coarse-mode dust properties, including size distribution, mass loading,
shape, composition, refractive indices and optical properties. Size
distributions from 0.1 to 100 µm diameter (d) are presented, fully
incorporating the coarse and giant modes of dust. Within the MBL, mean
effective diameter (deff) and volume median diameter (VMD) were 4.6 and 6.0 µm respectively, giant particles with a mode at
20–30 µm were observed, and composition was dominated by quartz and
alumino-silicates at d {\textgreater} 1 µm. Within the SAL, particles
larger than 20 µm diameter were always present up to 5 km altitude, in
concentrations over 10−5 cm−3, constituting up to 40 \% of
total dust mass. Mean deff and VMD were 4.0 and 5.5 µm
respectively. Larger particles were detected in the SAL than can be explained
by sedimentation theory alone. Coarse-mode composition was dominated by
quartz and alumino-silicates; the accumulation mode showed a strong
contribution from sulfate-rich and sea salt particles. In the SAL, measured
single scattering albedos (SSAs) at 550 nm representing d {\textless} 2.5 µm were
0.93 to 0.98 (mean 0.97). Optical properties calculated for the full
size distribution (0.1 {\textless} d {\textless} 100 µm) resulted in lower
SSAs of 0.91–0.98 (mean 0.95) and mass extinction coefficients of 0.27–0.35 m2 g−1 (mean 0.32 m2 g−1). Variability in SSA was mainly
controlled by variability in dust composition (principally iron) rather than
by variations in the size distribution, in contrast with previous observations
over the Sahara where size is the dominant influence. It is important that
models are able to capture the variability and evolution of both dust
composition and size distribution with transport in order to accurately
represent the impacts of dust on climate. These results provide a new SAL
dust dataset, fully representing coarse and giant particles, to aid model
validation and development.},

	abstract = {Large-eddy simulations (LES) are an important tool for investigating the longstanding energy-balance-closure problem, as they provide continuous, spatially-distributed information about turbulent flow at a high temporal resolution. Former LES studies reproduced an energy-balance gap similar to the observations in the field typically amounting to 10–30\% for heights on the order of 100 m in convective boundary layers even above homogeneous surfaces. The underestimation is caused by dispersive fluxes associated with large-scale turbulent organized structures that are not captured by single-tower measurements. However, the gap typically vanishes near the surface, i.e. at typical eddy-covariance measurement heights below 20 m, contrary to the findings from field measurements. In this study, we aim to find a LES set-up that can represent the correct magnitude of the energy-balance gap close to the surface. Therefore, we use a nested two-way coupled LES, with a fine grid that allows us to resolve fluxes and atmospheric structures at typical eddy-covariance measurement heights of 20 m. Under different stability regimes we compare three different options for lower boundary conditions featuring grassland and forest surfaces, i.e. (1) prescribed surface fluxes, (2) a land-surface model, and (3) a land-surface model in combination with a resolved canopy. We show that the use of prescribed surface fluxes and a land-surface model yields similar dispersive heat fluxes that are very small near the vegetation top for both grassland and forest surfaces. However, with the resolved forest canopy, dispersive heat fluxes are clearly larger, which we explain by a clear impact of the resolved canopy on the relationship between variance and flux–variance similarity functions.},

Different numerical approaches and computational codes have been used to simulate the particle-laden ﬂow and calculations have been carried on long enough to achieve a statistically steady condition for particle distribution. In such stationary regime, a comprehensive database including both post-processed statistics and raw data for the ﬂuid and for the particles has been obtained. The complete datasets can be downloaded from the web at HTTP://CFD.CINECA.IT/CFD/REPOSITORY/.

The 10 questions addressed are stated at the end of the introduction. Several of these questions highlight the importance of recognizing the dependence of LES calculations on the artiﬁcial parameter (i.e. the ﬁlter width or, more generally, the turbulence resolution length scale). The principle that LES predictions of turbulence statistics should depend minimally on provides an alternative justiﬁcation for the dynamic procedure.},

Three representative cases, an unladen case and low- and high-Stokes-number particle-laden cases, are performed to investigate the turbulent modification by particles. To this end, we compare several statistical quantities to understand the particle effect on momentum exchange and interphasial energy transfer. The modulation of large-scale motions (LSMs) and very-large-scale motions (VLSMs) are analysed using spectral information, and we find that the LSMs and VLSMs are generally weakened in the inner and outer layers, which is qualitatively different from similar simulations at lower Reynolds numbers (

The particles tend to widen and shorten the spanwise and streamwise extent of coherent structures, respectively. Furthermore, we find that the vorticity vector displays a preferential alignment with the eigenvector corresponding to the intermediate eigenvalue of the strain-rate tensor, independent of the particle Stokes number.},

	abstract = {A regime of very long meandering positive and negative streamwise velocity fluctuations, that we term ‘superstructures’, are found to exist in the log and lower wake regions of turbulent boundary layers. Measurements are made with a spanwise rake of 10 hot-wires in two separate facilities (spanning more than a decade of
              Re
              τ
              ) and are compared with existing PIV and DNS results. In all cases, we note evidence of a large-scale stripiness in the streamwise velocity fluctuations. The length of these regions can commonly exceed 20δ. Similar length scales have been previously reported for pipes and DNS channel flows. It is suggested that the true length of these features is masked from single-point statistics (such as autocorrelations and spectra) by a spanwise meandering tendency. Support for this conjecture is offered through the study of a synthetic flow composed only of sinusoidally meandering elongated low- and high-speed regions. From detailed maps of one-dimensional spectra, it is found that the contribution to the streamwise turbulence intensities associated with the superstructures appears to be increasingly significant with Reynolds number, and scales with outer length variables (δ). Importantly, the superstructure maintains a presence or footprint in the near-wall region, seeming to modulate or influence the near-wall cycle. This input of low-wavenumber outer-scaled energy into the near-wall region is consistent with the rise in near-wall streamwise intensities, when scaled with inner variables, that has been noted to occur with increasing Reynolds number. In an attempt to investigate these structures at very high Reynolds numbers, we also report on recent large-scale sonic anemometer rake measurements, made in the neutrally stable atmospheric surface layer. Preliminary results indicate that the superstructure is present in the log region of this atmospheric flow at

While it may be thought that settling can be ignored when the settling parameter Sv≡vs/uτ is small (vs is Stokes settling velocity, uτ is fluid friction velocity), we show that even in this regime the settling may make a leading order contribution to the concentration profiles. This is because the importance of settling is determined, not by the size of vs compared with uτ or any other fluid velocity scale, but by the size of vs relative to the other mechanisms that control the vertical particle velocity and concentration profile. We explain this in the context of the particle mean-momentum equation, and show that in general, there always exists a region in the boundary layer where settling cannot be neglected, no matter how small Sv is (provided it is finite). Direct numerical simulations confirm the arguments and show that the near-wall concentration is highly dependent on Sv even when Sv≪1, and it can reduce by an order of magnitude when Sv is increased from O(10−4) to O(10−2). The results also show that the preferential sampling of ejection events in the boundary layer by inertial particles when Sv=0 is profoundly altered as Sv is increased, and it is replaced by a preferential sampling of sweep events due to the onset of the preferential sweeping mechanism.},

	abstract = {, 
Direct numerical simulations of particle-laden turbulent channel flows at friction Reynolds number Reτ𝑅𝑒𝜏Re\_{\textbackslash}tau from 600600600 to 200020002000 have been performed to examine the near-wall particle streaks. Different from the well-observed small-scale particle streaks in near-wall turbulence of low Reτ𝑅𝑒𝜏Re\_{\textbackslash}tau, the present results show large-scale particle streaks through the computational domain formed for relatively high-inertia particles at high Reτ𝑅𝑒𝜏Re\_{\textbackslash}tau. Transferred by large-scale sweep and ejection events (Q−𝑄−Q{\textasciicircum}-), these high-inertia particles preferentially accumulate in near-wall regions beneath the large-scale low-speed flow streaks observed in the logarithmic region. The corresponding Stokes numbers are associated with the lifetime of large-scale Q−𝑄−Q{\textasciicircum}- structures, which increases as the Reynolds number grows. The small-scale particle streaks with a typical Stokes number Stν≈30𝑆𝑡𝜈≈30St\_{\textbackslash}nu {\textbackslash}approx 30 are mainly driven by the Q−𝑄−Q{\textasciicircum}- structures in the buffer layer, whose lifetime is approximately 303030 in viscous time unit. Therefore, we propose a new structure-based Stokes number normalized by the lifetime of Q−𝑄−Q{\textasciicircum}- structures of different scales. The relevant flow scales that control the formation of the large-scale particle streaks are parameterized by the structure-based Stokes number. The small-scale (large-scale) particle streaks are most prominent when the buffer-layer (large-scale) structure-based Stokes number approaches unity. The present findings reveal that formation of near-wall particle streaks is governed by the Q−𝑄−Q{\textasciicircum}- structures of different scales, and the particles with different inertia respond efficiently to the Q−𝑄−Q{\textasciicircum}- structures of corresponding scales with respect to the particle translational motion.},

The translational and rotational motion, as well as concentration and dispersion, are compared with those of spheres of similar inertia. Disks and fibres both oversample high-speed fluid near the wall, in agreement with particle-resolved numerical simulations. Fibres tend to orient mostly in the streamwise direction while disks maintain their symmetry axis quasi-normal to the wall. This alignment is more stable for disks than for fibres: the latter undergo strong tumbling near the wall in response to the mean shear and turbulent fluid velocity fluctuations, whereas the former wobble about their preferential wall-normal orientation. The translational and rotational accelerations indicate that, despite the nominal relaxation times being similar, the disks are slower than the fibres in responding to wall turbulence. For both, wall contact causes strong and intermittent tumbling. The concentration profiles follow Rouse–Prandtl theory over a limited portion of the boundary layer, deviating near the wall and in the outer region. This is largely due to the non-uniform settling velocity, which decreases steeply approaching the wall for all particle types. This is, in turn, a consequence of the reduced particle diffusivity, which closely matches the profile of the eddy viscosity.},

The Reynolds number is 𝑅𝑒𝜏=570Reτ=570Re\_\{{\textbackslash}tau \} = 570 and the particle Stokes number is St+=15St+=15\{\{{\textbackslash}textit \{St\}\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{+\} = 15. Particle image velocimetry and tracking are used to obtain simultaneous, time-resolved flow fields and particle trajectories. Particles travel at a lower mean velocity than the fluid: in the log layer this is due to the oversampling of slow fluid regions, but closer to the wall the cause is instantaneous slip between particles and fluid. The particle Reynolds stresses exceed those of the fluid. Near the wall, the particle streamwise diffusivity is larger than the momentum diffusivity, while the opposite is true for the wall-normal component. The particle transport is strongly linked to ejections, while the role of sweeps is marginal, and there is no evidence of turbophoresis. The concentration profile follows a power law with a shallower slope than predicted by equilibrium theories that neglect particle inertia. Upward-/downward-moving particles display positive/negative mean streamwise acceleration due to the particle–fluid slip. The particles that contact the wall are faster than the local fluid both before reaching the wall and after leaving it. Therefore, they are decelerated by drag and pushed downward by shear-induced lift. The durations of wall contact follow exponential distributions with characteristic time scale close to the particle response time. Lift-offs coincide with particles meeting a fluid ejection. These observations emphasize the competing effects of inertia and gravity.},

	abstract = {The average settling velocity in homogeneous turbulence of a small rigid spherical particle, subject to a Stokes drag force, has been shown to differ from that in still fluid owing to a bias from the particle inertia (Maxey 1987). Previous numerical results for particles in a random flow field, where the flow dynamics were not considered, showed an increase in the average settling velocity. Direct numerical simulations of the motion of heavy particles in isotropic homogeneous turbulence have been performed where the flow dynamics are included. These show that a significant increase in the average settling velocity can occur for particles with inertial response time and still-fluid terminal velocity comparable to the Kolmogorov scales of the turbulence. This increase may be as much as 50\% of the terminal velocity, which is much larger than was previously found. The concentration field of the heavy particles, obtained from direct numerical simulations, shows the importance of the inertial bias with particles tending to collect in elongated sheets on the peripheries of local vortical structures. This is coupled then to a preferential sweeping of the particles in downward moving fluid. Again the importance of Kolmogorov scaling to these processes is demonstrated. Finally, some consideration is given to larger particles that are subject to a nonlinear drag force where it is found that the nonlinearity reduces the net increase in settling velocity.},

	abstract = {Very-large-scale motions (VLSMs) and large-scale motions (LSMs) coexist at moderate Reynolds numbers in a very long open channel flow. Direct numerical simulations two-way coupled with inertial particles are analysed using spectral information to investigate the modulation of VLSMs. In the wall-normal direction, particle distributions (mean/preferential concentration) exhibit two distinct behaviours in the inner flow and outer flow, corresponding to two highly anisotropic turbulent structures, LSMs and VLSMs. This results in particle inertia’s non-monotonic effects on the VLSMs: low inertia (based on the inner scale) and high inertia (based on the outer scale) both strengthen the VLSMs, whereas moderate and very high inertia have little influence. Through conditional tests, low- and high-inertia particles enhance VLSMs following two distinct routes. Low-inertia particles promote VLSMs indirectly through the enhancement of the regeneration cycle (the self-sustaining mechanism of LSMs) in the inner region, whereas high-inertia particles enhance the VLSM directly through contribution to the Reynolds shear stress at similar temporal scales in the outer region. This understanding also provides more general insight into inner–outer interaction in high-Reynolds-number, wall-bounded flows.},

              , vol. 174, 1987, pp. 441–465), which applied to weakly inertial particles, to particles of arbitrary inertia, and the new theoretical result revealed the role that different scales play in the preferential sweeping mechanism that leads to enhanced particle settling in turbulent flows. Monchaux \& Dejoan (
              Phys. Rev. Fluids
              , vol. 2, 2017, 104302) showed using direct numerical simulations that, while for low particle loading the effect of two-way coupling (2WC) on the global flow statistics is weak, 2WC enables the particles to drag the fluid in their vicinity down with them, significantly enhancing their settling, and they argued that 2WC suppresses the preferential sweeping mechanism. We explore this further by considering the impact of 2WC on the contribution made by eddies of different sizes on the particle settling. In agreement with Monchaux \& Dejoan, we show that even for low loading, 2WC strongly enhances particle settling, and we show how 2WC modifies the contribution from different flow scales. However, contrary to their study, we show that preferential sweeping remains important in 2WC flows. In particular, for both 1WC and 2WC flows, the settling enhancement due to turbulence is dominated by contributions from particles in straining regions of the flow, but for the 2WC case, the particles in these regions also drag the fluid down with them, leading to an enhancement of their settling compared with the 1WC case.},

	abstract = {A large-eddy simulation model is coupled with a Lagrangian cloud model to study marine fog. In this model, aerosols and droplets are treated from a Lagrangian frame of reference, in contrast to the traditional bulk and bin microphysical models. Droplet growth via condensation is governed by Köhler theory and environmental conditions local to the droplet. Coupling to the vapour and temperature ﬁelds of the ﬂow ensures mass, momentum, and energy conservation between the air and droplet phases. Based on the recent C-FOG ﬁeld campaign, a simulation is performed which highlights the beneﬁts and potential of this type of model. By initializing the simulation with the measured aerosol size distribution and making assumptions about the chemical composition of the multiple peaks, the simulations provide a clear explanation for the observed bimodal droplet distribution during C-FOG: high supersaturation levels cause condensational growth of nearly all coarse-mode aerosols (presumed to be composed of marine salt), as well as a large number of accumulation model aerosols (presumed to be of continental origin with a lower hygroscopicity). The largest peak in the resulting droplet distribution is created from coarse-mode aerosols with high hygroscopicity, while the secondary peak is only possible due to the limited impact of the largest peak on saturation levels inside the fog. Thus, for the simulated levels of supersaturation, it is the limited number of coarse-mode aerosols which is responsible for the emergence of a larger second peak.},

	abstract = {We investigate the transport of size-selected particles suspended in turbulent boundary layers at friction Reynolds numbers up to Reτ = 19 000. We use microscopic glass spheres in air, spanning a wide range of viscous Stokes numbers, St+ = 18–870. These are imaged simultaneously with the ﬂow tracers, and particle image and tracking velocimetry are used to measure the two-phase ﬂow along a wall-normal plane in the logarithmic region. The air ﬂow statistics are not altered by the particles at the present mass loading. In comparison to the classic equilibrium solution, the particle concentration proﬁles display weaker wall-normal gradients. This is shown to be an effect of particle inertia: this manifests itself through different mechanisms in different strata of the ﬂow, and the effects on the concentration are captured by a three-layer parameterization of the proﬁle. The particles lag the ﬂuid across the boundary layer, with a mean slip velocity of the order of the friction velocity and increasing with particle inertia. Near the wall this lag is mainly due to the instantaneous slip of the particles relative to the surrounding ﬂuid, while away from the wall the leading cause is the preferential sampling of low-speed ﬂuid regions. Larger particles (in the size range of sand, as opposed to dust) display a qualitatively different behaviour, likely because of nonlinear drag effects. All considered particles oversample speciﬁc regions of the ﬂuid ﬂow: they favour regions of negative streamwise ﬂuctuations, especially ejection events, and are likely to be found about the centre of strain cells with backward-leaning compressive axis and forward-leaning extensive axis. This pattern is visible for a wide range of Stokes numbers, underscoring the multi-scale nature of preferential concentration. The present ﬁndings highlight how high-Reynolds-number features of turbulent boundary layers impact the transport of suspended inertial particles, and thus are especially relevant to environmental and geophysical ﬂows.},

The focus is on spherical particles in homogeneous and canonical wall-bounded flows. The analysis of recent data indicates that conclusions drawn in zero gravity should not be extrapolated outside of this condition, and that the particle response time alone cannot completely define the dynamics of finite-size particles. Several breakthroughs have been reported, mostly separately, on the dynamics and turbulence modifications of small inertial particles in dilute conditions and of large weakly buoyant spheres. Measurements at higher concentrations, simulations fully resolving smaller particles, and theoretical tools accounting for both phases are needed to bridge this gap and allow for the exploration of the fluid dynamics of suspensions, from laminar rheology and granular media to particulate turbulence.},

	abstract = {A linearly depth-dependent diffusivity is commonly used to model the vertical distribution of dilute, near-bed, suspended sediment in marine fluid environments, i.e., the Rouse model; this simplified form predicts unfortunately infinite concentration at the bed. That singularity causes problems in linking bed models to suspended sediment models. A common remedy to this problem is to assume a reference concentration and height above the bed, but some studies point to the arbitrariness of that procedure and suggest, instead, the existence of a residual eddy diffusion near the bed, which removes the singularity. In these past studies, the residual diffusion, εo, has been assigned a value based on the Nikuradse roughness height, ks = 2.5ds, where ds is the (mean) equivalent sand-grain diameter. We examine this assumption by fitting a residual diffusion model to 14 timeaveraged suspended-sediment profiles available in the literature, without assuming the Nikuradse length. This procedure produces εo values from 0.6 to 13 cm2 s−1, which are much greater than both the (molecular) kinematic viscosity of water and the expected Brownian diffusion coefficient of the sediment grains of the reported sizes. These residual diffusion coefficients indicate mixing scale heights at the bed, εo/κu∗, where κ is von Kármán's constant and u∗ is the shear velocity, are 7.4–56.0× greater than the Nikuradse height, ks. Although defined by only limited data, we also find that the residual diffusion correlates with grain size and the roughness Reynolds number but not with the Rouse parameter, nor with the shear and settling velocities. In addition, the residual diffusion coefficient correlates with van Rijn's roughness scale, again based on the same limited data, suggesting that bedforms influence residual diffusion near the bed.},

Therefore, particle dry deposition on urban surfaces is not easy to conﬁgure and, although empirical or semi-empirical models in literature have been developed to address this aspect, there is not standardized and commonly accepted criteria, especially for submicron particles. In this paper, comparisons of diﬀerent dry deposition models and measurement data by experimental campaigns, covering for diﬀerent surface roughness conditions, i.e. from four Italian cities and urban environments of other countries, are performed.

	abstract = {Surface roughness can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the ﬂuid dynamics and heat transfer in convective ﬂows by inducing perturbations in the velocity proﬁle which affect surface drag, turbulent mixing and heat transfer. While surface roughness can often negatively affect the performance of systems, it can also lead to performance improvements, such as in convective ﬂows where roughness elements have been shown to enhance heat transfer. Turbulent ﬂows over rough surfaces have been studied for about a century leading to signiﬁcant developments in this ﬁeld. Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) has made signiﬁcant contributions to the knowledge of turbulent ﬂows over rough surfaces as well as evaluation of the developed theories. Moreover, the turbulent closures model has seen wide use for simulation of rough-wall turbulent ﬂows in practical applications where DNS is hindered by its complexity and computational resources.},

	abstract = {The equilibrium Eulerian method is a simple way to determine the velocity ﬁeld of a disperse system of particles. It avoids solving a partial diﬀerential equation for particle velocity, which makes it more eﬃcient than the standard Eulerian–Eulerian method. It captures such essential disperse-phase physics as preferential concentration and turbophoretic migration––eﬀects which are ignored by methods that set the particle velocity equal to the ﬂuid velocity. Although the equilibrium Eulerian method works well for small particles, it fails for particles that are too large. This paper presents a straightforward improvement to the method which minimizes the error for larger particles, thereby extending the methodÕs range of applicability. In particular, it is demonstrated that the modiﬁed method captures a physical mechanism neglected by unmodiﬁed method: the memory a particle retains when it migrates to an adjacent layer of ﬂuid. The improvement is demonstrated in a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of turbulent channel ﬂow, where particles migrate toward the wall through a strong shear. It is also demonstrated that the modiﬁed method performs well in a case where no mean shear is present: a DNS of isotropic turbulence.},

Reeks’ version of the kinetic theory is used to generate the mass, momentum and kinetic stress equations for the particle distribution. The particle tracking data are used to directly evaluate the dispersion tensors k and l which serve as closure relations for the continuum equations. These exact forms are compared to approximate, local forms. Even for low Stokes numbers (corresponding to low particle inertia deﬁned by s/sp ) 1), the tensor k is strongly aﬀected by the inhomogeneity and depends on turbulence parameters in the volume corresponding to the particle path dispersion over the particle Lagrangian integral timescale s. In contrast, the locally homogeneous form of the velocity dispersion tensor l is a suﬃcient approximation, since it depends on the dispersion volume over the much smaller particle relaxation time sp. It is demonstrated that the body force due to the dispersion vector c cannot be neglected. In the limit of passive tracers (zero stopping distance), c is equal to the gradient of k, if the physical setting is such that we can invoke constant tracer density in this limit.},

The Stokes number estimate has been used to establish parameter range where point–particle approach is ideally suited. The point–particle approach can be extended to handle ‘‘ﬁnite-sized” particles whose diameter approach that of the smallest resolved eddies. However, new challenges arise in the implementation of Lagrangian–Eulerian coupling between the particles and the carrier phase. An approach where the inter-phase momentum and energy coupling can be separated into a deterministic and a stochastic contribution has been suggested.},

It includes deposition processes, such as, turbulent transfer, Brownian di!usion, impaction, interception, gravitational settling and particle rebound. Particle growth under humid conditions is also considered. Sensitivity tests show that the parameterization provides deposition velocities comparable with recent "eld observations, especially for sub-micron particles. The present parameterization has also been evaluated using two empirical bulk resistance models, which were originally developed from "eld observations. The present parameterization has been implemented in CAM, with meteorological input provided by the Canadian Regional Climate Model (RCM) to the eastern North America. A comparison of the modelled dry deposition velocities to a variety of recent measurements that have been reported in the literature demonstrated that the current parameterization produces reasonable results. The main improvement of the current parameterization compared to earlier size-dependent particle dry deposition models is that the current one produces more realistic deposition velocities for sub-micron particles and agrees better with recently published "eld measurements. 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

	abstract = {The dry deposition process is recognized as an important pathway among the various removal processes of pollutants in the atmosphere. In this ﬁeld, there are several models reported in the literature useful to predict the dry deposition velocity of particles of diﬀerent diameters but many of them are not capable of representing dry deposition phenomena for several categories of pollutants and deposition surfaces. Moreover, their applications is valid for speciﬁc conditions and if the data in that application meet all of the assumptions required of the data used to deﬁne the model. In this paper a new dry deposition velocity model based on an electrical analogy schema is proposed to overcome the above issues. The dry deposition velocity is evaluated by assuming that the resistances that aﬀect the particle ﬂux in the Quasi-Laminar Sub-layers can be combined to take into account local features of the mutual inﬂuence of inertial impact processes and the turbulent one. Comparisons with the experimental data from literature indicate that the proposed model allows to capture with good agreement the main dry deposition phenomena for the examined environmental conditions and deposition surfaces to be determined. The proposed approach could be easily implemented within atmospheric dispersion modeling codes and eﬃciently addressing diﬀerent deposition surfaces for several particle pollution.},

The random SFS velocity is modeled using an adaptation of Thomson’s LSM in which the ensemblemean velocity and velocity variances are replaced by the resolved velocity and SFS variances, respectively. The random SFS velocity forcing has an amplitude determined by the SFS fraction of the total turbulent kinetic energy (TKE); the fraction is about 0.15 in the bulk of the simulated convective boundary layer (CBL) used here and reaches values as large as 0.31 and 0.37 in the surface layer and entrainment layer, respectively.},

Unlike the widely used Coupled Ocean–Atmosphere Response Experiment (COARE) bulk ﬂux scheme, the simple model (i) does not use Monin–Obukhov similarity theory (MOST) and therefore does not require an estimate of the Obukhov length, (ii) does not require a correction to the wind speed for height or stability, (iii) does not require an estimate of the aerodynamic roughness length, and (iv) does not require iteration. In comparing the model estimates developed in this work and those of the COARE algorithm, comparable ﬁtting metrics for the two modeling schemes are found. That is, using Monin–Obukhov similarity theory and the Charnock relationship did not signiﬁcantly improve the predictions. It is not clear how general the simple model proposed here is, but the same model with the same coefﬁcients based on the combined dataset does a reasonable job of describing the datasets both individually and collectively. In addition, the simple model was generally able to predict the observed friction velocities for three independent datasets that were not used in tuning the model coefﬁcients. Motivation for the simple model comes from the fact that physical interpretation of MOST can be ambiguous because of circular dependencies and self-correlation. Additional motivation comes from the large uncertainty associated with estimating the Obukhov length and, especially, the aerodynamic roughness length.},

In addition, we discuss sensitivity analysis and evaluation of the models, user operational requirements, such as model availability and documentation, and output availability and dissemination. In this manner, this article allows for the evaluation of the relative strengths and weaknesses of the various modelling systems and modelling approaches. Finally, this article highlights the most prominent gaps of knowledge for chemical weather forecasting models and suggests potential priorities for future research directions, for the following selected focus areas: emission inventories, the integration of numerical weather prediction and atmospheric chemical transport models, boundary conditions and nesting of models, data assimilation of the various chemical species, improved understanding and parameterization of physical processes, better evaluation of models against data and the construction of model ensembles.},

With regard to the coherent motions, very-large-scale motions or superstructures exist at all Reynolds numbers, but they become increasingly important with Reynolds number in terms of their energy content and their interaction with the smaller scales near the wall. There is accumulating evidence that certain features are ﬂow speciﬁc, such as the constants in the log law and the behavior of the very large scales and their interaction with the large scales (consisting of vortex packets). Moreover, the reﬁned attached-eddy hypothesis continues to provide an important theoretical framework for the structure of wall-bounded turbulent ﬂows.},

Dry deposition is driven by turbulence and shows a strong dependence on particle size. This review summarizes the mechanisms behind aerosol dry deposition, including measurement approaches, field observations, and modeling studies. We identify several gaps in the literature, including deposition over the cryosphere (i.e., snow and ice surfaces) and the ocean; in addition, we highlight new techniques to measure black carbon fluxes.

	abstract = {After an extensive survey of mean-velocityprofile measurements in various two-dimensional incompressible turbulent boundarylayer flows, it is proposed to represent the profile by a linear combination of two universal functions. One is the well-known law of the wall. The other, called the law of the wake, is characterized by the profile at a point of separation or reattachment. These functions are considered to be established empirically, by a study of the mean-velocity profile, without reference to any hypothetical mechanism of turbulence. Using the resulting complete analytic representation for the mean-velocity field, the shearing-stress field for several flows is computed from the boundary-layer equations and compared with experimental data. The development of a turbulent boundary layer is ultimately interpreted in terms of an equivalent wake profile, which supposedly represents the large-eddy structure and is a consequence of the constraint provided by inertia. This equivalent wake profile is modified by the presence of a wall, at which a further constraint is provided by viscosity. The wall constraint, although it penetrates the entire boundary layer, is manifested chiefly in the sublayer flow and in the logarithmic profile near the wall.},

	abstract = {A size-resolved particle dry deposition scheme is developed for inclusion in large-scale air quality and climate models where the size distribution and fate of atmospheric aerosols is of concern. The “resistance” structure is similar to what is proposed by Zhang et al. (2001), while a new “surface” deposition velocity (or surface resistance) is derived by simpliﬁcation of a one-dimensional aerosol transport model (Petroff et al., 2008b, 2009). Compared to Zhang et al.’s model, the present model accounts for the leaf size, shape and area index as well as the height of the vegetation canopy. Consequently, it is more sensitive to the change of land covers, particularly in the accumulation mode (0.1–1 micron). A drift velocity is included to account for the phoretic effects related to temperature and humidity gradients close to liquid and solid water surfaces. An extended comparison of this model with experimental evidence is performed over typical land covers such as bare ground, grass, coniferous forest, liquid and solid water surfaces and highlights its adequate prediction. The predictions of the present model differ from Zhang et al.’s model in the ﬁne mode, where the latter tends to over-estimate in a signiﬁcant way the particle deposition, as measured by various investigators or predicted by the present model. The present development is thought to be useful to modellers of the atmospheric aerosol who need an adequate parameterization of aerosol dry removal to the earth surface, described here by 26 land covers. An open source code is available in Fortran90.},

	abstract = {Wet and dry depositions of aerosols in WRF-Chem are revisited and updated based on recent observational findings. Traditionally, in-cloud scavenging was thought to play a more dominant role in aerosol wet removal than below-cloud scavenging. However, recent field measurements indicated a considerable contribution of below-cloud scavenging of 50\%–60\% to total wet deposition. In contrast, the simulated contribution of in-cloud scavenging in the previous version of WRF-Chem was too large, exhibiting 88\%–95\%, likely due to the binary representation of cloud fraction. To reduce the model bias, this study adopts a continuous-type cloud fraction and implements a semi-empirical below-cloud scavenging parameterization. Simulation results with the new scheme show that the contribution of below-cloud (in-cloud) scavenging is increased to 63\%–66\% (decreased to 34\%–37\%), well capturing the observational estimates. The magnitude of total wet deposition is increased by 18.2\% for SO4, 7.16\% for NO3, and 14.8\% for NH4, showing better agreements with observations particularly for SO4 and NH4 deposition. The increased wet removal with the new scheme reduces and so better reproduces surface PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations, which is also partly attributed to the increased contribution of below-cloud scavenging. It is found that dry deposition velocity in the previous version was too high for coarse mode particles when friction velocity is large, which underestimates surface PM10 concentration. The updated dry deposition scheme that is constrained by observations effectively improves PM10 performance by reducing the dry deposition velocity for coarse mode particles.},

High-frequency measurements of dust size distribution were obtained from 0.16 to 300 μm diameter, and eddy covariance ﬂuxes were derived. This is more than an order of magnitude larger size range than previous ﬂux estimates. Links to surface emission are provided by analysis of particle drift velocities. Number ﬂux is described by a À2 power law between 1 and 144 μm diameter, signiﬁcantly larger than the 12 μm upper limit suggested by Kok (2011a). For small particles, the deviation from a power law varies with terrain type and the large size cutoff is correlated with atmospheric vertical turbulent kinetic energy, suggesting control by vertical transport rather than emission processes. The measured mass ﬂux mode is in the range 30–100 μm. The turbulent scales important for dust ﬂux are from 0.1 km to 1–10 km. The upper scale increases during the morning as boundary layer depth and eddy size increase. All locations where large dust ﬂuxes were measured had large topographical variations. These features are often linked with highly erodible surface features, such as wadis or dunes. We also hypothesize that upslope ﬂow and ﬂow separation over such features enhance the dust ﬂux by transporting large particles out of the saltation layer. The tendency to locate surface ﬂux measurements in open, ﬂat terrain means these favored dust sources have been neglected in previous studies.},

Speciﬁcally both the particle position and velocity are considered to be functionals of the driving force and an application of a more general form of the Furutsu–Novikov theorem leads to closed expressions for the phase space diffusion current (i.e. the net force due to the turbulence acting on the particles per unit volume of phase space). In the case of a Gaussian random driving force the closed expressions reduce to a simple Boussinesq form in gradients of the pdf with respect to particle velocity and position.

              Dry deposition is a key sink of atmospheric particles, which impact human and ecosystem health, and the radiative balance of the planet. However, the deposition parameterizations used in climate and air-quality models are poorly constrained by observations. Dry deposition of submicron particles is the largest uncertainty in aerosol indirect radiative forcing. Our particle flux observations indicate that dry deposition velocities are an order of magnitude lower than models suggest. Our updated, observation-driven parameterizations should reduce uncertainty in modeled dry deposition. The scheme increases modeled accumulation mode aerosol number concentrations, and enhances the combined natural and anthropogenic aerosol indirect effect by −0.63 W m

              Wet and dry deposition remove aerosols from the atmosphere, and these processes control aerosol lifetime and thus impact climate and air quality. Dry deposition is a significant source of aerosol uncertainty in global chemical transport and climate models. Dry deposition parameterizations in most global models were developed when few particle deposition measurements were available. However, new measurement techniques have enabled more size-resolved particle flux observations. We combined literature measurements with data that we collected over a grassland in Oklahoma and a pine forest in Colorado to develop a dry deposition parameterization. We find that relative to observations, previous parameterizations overestimated deposition of the accumulation and Aitken mode particles, and underestimated in the coarse mode. These systematic differences in observed and modeled accumulation mode particle deposition velocities are as large as an order of magnitude over terrestrial ecosystems. As accumulation mode particles form most of the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) that influence the indirect radiative effect, this model-measurement discrepancy in dry deposition alters modeled CCN and radiative forcing. We present a revised observationally driven parameterization for regional and global aerosol models. Using this revised dry deposition scheme in the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS)-Chem chemical transport model, we find that global surface accumulation-mode number concentrations increase by 62\% and enhance the global combined anthropogenic and natural aerosol indirect effect by −0.63 W m

	abstract = {In many atmospheric ﬂows, a dispersed phase is actively suspended by turbulence, whose competition with gravitational settling ultimately dictates its vertical distribution. Examples of dispersed phases include snow, sea-spray droplets, dust, or sand, where individual elements of much larger density than the surrounding air are carried by turbulent motions after emission from the surface. In cases where the particle is assumed to deviate from local ﬂuid motions only by its gravitational settling (i.e., they are inertialess), traditional ﬂux balances predict a power-law dependence of particle concentration with height. It is unclear, however, how particle inertia inﬂuences this relationship, and this question is the focus of this work. Direct numerical simulations are conducted of turbulent open-channel ﬂow, laden with Lagrangian particles of speciﬁed inertia; in this way the study focuses on the turbulent transport which occurs in the lowest few meters of the planetary boundary layer, in regions critical for connecting emission ﬂuxes to the ﬂuxes felt by the full-scale boundary layer. Simulations over a wide range of particle Stokes number, while holding the dimensionless settling velocity constant, are performed to understand the role of particle inertia on vertical dispersion. It is found that particles deviate from their inertialess behaviour in ways that are not easily captured by traditional theory; concentrations are reduced with increasing Stokes number. Furthermore, a similarity-based eddy diffusivity for particle concentration fails as particles experience inertial acceleration, precluding a closed-form solution for particle concentration as in the case of inertialess particles. The primary consequence of this result is that typical ﬂux parametrizations connecting surface emission models (e.g., saltation models or sea-spray generation functions) to elevated boundary conditions may overestimate particle concentrations due to the reduced vertical transport caused by inertia in between; likewise particle emission may be underestimated if inferred from concentration measurements aloft.},

	abstract = {Dry deposition is an important loss process for atmospheric particles and can be a significant part of total deposition estimates calculated for critical loads analyses. However, algorithms used in large-scale air quality and atmospheric chemistry models to predict particle deposition velocity as a function of particle size are highly uncertain. Many of these algorithms, although derived from a common heritage, predict vastly different particle deposition velocities for a given particle diameter even under identical environmental conditions for major land use classes. Even more problematic, for vegetated landscapes (forests, in particular) the algorithms do not agree very well with available measurements. In this work, we perform a sensitivity study to estimate how significant the uncertainties in particle deposition algorithms may be in an air quality model’s predictions of ground-level fine particle concentrations, particle deposition and overall total deposition of nitrogen and sulfur. Our results suggest that fine particle concentration predictions at the surface may vary by 5–15\% depending on the choice of particle deposition velocity algorithm, while particle dry deposition is affected to a much greater extent with differences among algorithms {\textgreater}200\%. Moreover, if accumulation mode particle dry deposition measurements over forests are correct, then dry particle deposition and total elemental deposition to these landscapes may be much larger than is typically simulated by current air quality and atmospheric chemistry models, calling into question commonly available estimates of total deposition and their use in critical loads analyses. Since accurate predictions of atmospheric particle concentrations and deposition are critically important for future air quality, weather and climate models and management of pollutant deposition to sensitive ecosystems, an investment in new dry deposition measurements in conjunction with integrated modelling efforts seems not only justified but vitally necessary to advance and improve the treatment of particle dry deposition processes in atmospheric models.},

Motion is considered in a frame moving with the mean velocity of the fluid, the forces acting on the particle being taken as gravity and a fluid drag assumed linear in the particle velocity relative to that of the fluid. The probability distribution of the fluid velocity field in this frame is taken as Gaussian, homogeneous, isotropic, stationary and of zero mean. It is shown that, in the absence of gravity, the long-time particle diffusion coefficient is in general greater than that of the fluid, approaching with increasing particle relaxation time a value consistent with the particle being in an Eulerian frame of reference. The effect of gravity is consistent with Yudine's effect of crossing trajectories, reducing unequally the particle diffusion in directions normal to and parallel to the direction of the gravitational field. To characterize the effect of flow and gravity on particle diffusion it has been found useful to use a Froude number defined in terms of the turbulent intensity rather than the mean velocity. Depending upon the value of this number, it is found that the particle integral time scale may initially decrease with increasing particle relaxation time though it eventually rises and approaches the particle relaxation time. It is finally shown how this analysis may be extended to include the extra forces generated by the fluid and particle accelerations.},

In principle, the ADE approach oﬀers a much simpler way of calculating the inertial deposition of particles in a turbulent boundary layer than that based on the PDF approach. However the ADE equations that have recently been used are only strictly valid for a simple Gaussian process when particle inertia is small. Using a prescribed, but in general non-Gaussian random particle velocity ﬁeld, it is shown that the net particle mass ﬂux contains a drift term in addition to that from the mean velocity of the particle velocity ﬁeld, associated with the compressibility of the velocity ﬁeld. Furthermore the diﬀusive ﬂux in general depends not only upon the gradient of the mean concentration (true only for a Gaussian random ﬂow ﬁeld) but also upon higher order derivatives whose relative contribution depends on diﬀusion coeﬃcients Dijk. . . etc. These coeﬃcients depend upon the statistical moments associated with random displacements and compressibility of the particle ﬂow ﬁeld along particle trajectories which in turn depend upon particle inertia. In contrast the PDF approach oﬀers the advantage of using a simple gradient (Gaussian) approximation in particle phase space which can lead to a non-Gaussian spatial dispersion process when particle inertia is important. Conditions based on the particle mean free path are derived for which a simple ADE is appropriate. Some of the features of particle transport in an inhomogeneous turbulent ﬂow are illustrated by examining particle dispersion in a random ﬂow ﬁeld composed of pairs of counter rotating vortices which has an rms velocity which increase linearly from a stagnation point.},

	abstract = {, 
            In wall-bounded turbulent flows, the wall-normal gradient in turbulence intensity causes inertial particles to move preferentially toward the wall, leading to elevated concentration levels in the viscous sublayer. At first glance, wall-modelled large-eddy simulations may seem ill suited for accurately simulating this behaviour, given that the sharp gradients and coherent structures in the viscous sublayer and buffer region are unresolved in this approach. In this paper, a detailed inspection of conservation equations describing the influence of turbophoresis and near-wall structures on particle concentration profiles reveals a more nuanced view depending on the friction Stokes number. The dynamics of low and moderate Stokes number particles indeed depends strongly on the complex spatio-temporal details of streaks, ejections, and sweeps in the near-wall region. This significantly impacts the near-wall particle concentration through a biased sampling effect which provides a net force away from the wall on the particle ensemble caused by the tendency of inertial particles to accumulate in low-speed ejection regions. At higher Stokes numbers, however, this biased sampling is of minimal importance, and the particle concentration becomes inversely proportional to the wall-normal particle velocity variance at a given distance from the wall. As a result, wall-modelled large-eddy simulations can predict concentration profiles with more accuracy in the high Stokes number regime than low Stokes numbers simply by modifying the interpolation scheme for particles between the first grid point and the boundary. However, accurate representation of low and moderate Stokes number particles depends critically on information not present in standard wall-modelled large-eddy simulations.},

This frazil-ice model treats a Lagrangian particle as a bulk cluster of many frazil crystals, and calculates the thermodynamic growth of each particle and the corresponding budget of latent heat and fresh water. The effective density and viscosity of sea water depend on the mass fraction of underwater frazil ice, and hence affect ocean convection. An idealized experiment using our model successfully reproduces the formation of underwater frazil ice and its transition to grease ice at the surface. Because underwater frazil ice does not reduce the atmosphere/ocean heat exchange, surface heat flux and net sea-ice production in the experiment with frazil ice are relatively high compared with the experiment where surface cooling directly leads to columnar growth of a solid ice cover which effectively insulates the heat flux. These results suggest that large-scale sea-ice models which do not take account of the effects of frazil ice might underestimate atmosphere/ocean heat exchange, particularly at times of active new ice formation.},

Dust transport and deposition are thus key links in the dust cycle. The understanding of these processes has applications in a wide range of research fields. From the perspective of geological studies, dust transport and deposition are important mechanisms for the delivery of sediments and minerals from continent to ocean and for the evolution of surface topography. For example, the formation of the loess plateau in China is believed to be a result of the deposition of dust and silt particles originating from the upstream desert areas. In the atmosphere, the presence of dust particles influences processes such as cloud formation and radiation transfer. High concentration of fine particulates in air is of concern to human health, and PM10 and PM2.5 have been used as key indicators of air quality. Dust particles from certain regions may carry harmful substances, and the fates of such particles are naturally of environmental concern. In this chapter, we focus on the physics of dust transport and deposition and study how these processes can be quantified.},

              We investigate the settling speeds and root mean square (r.m.s.) velocities of inertial particles in isotropic turbulence with gravity using experiments with water droplets in air turbulence from 32 loudspeaker jets and direct numerical simulations (DNS). The dependence on particle inertia, gravity and the scales of both the smallest and largest turbulent eddies is investigated. We isolate the mechanisms of turbulence settling modification and find that the reduced settling speeds of large particles in experiments are due to nonlinear drag effects. We demonstrate using DNS that reduced settling speeds with linear drag (e.g. see Nielsen,

much larger than in a quiescent fluid. It has been determined that the enhancement 
of the settling velocity depends on the particle loading, increasing as the volume 
fraction of particles in the flow increases. The spatial and temporal distribution of 
the particle concentration field is shown to exhibit large inhomogeneities. As the 
particles interact with the underlying turbulence they concentrate preferentially in 
certain regions of the flow. A characteristic dimension of these particle clusters is 
found to be related to the viscous scales of the flow. Measurements of the settling

that there is a monotonic increase in the settling velocity with the local concentration

In this study, the existence of an equilibrium state for dust concentration in the atmospheric surface layer above sources and sinks is evaluated using large-eddy simulation. Results show that for steady-state turbulence and negligible horizontal advection, an equilibrium mean vertical proﬁle of dust concentration is reached after one boundary-layer eddy turnover time. This is true for cases over a source or sink, under different atmospheric stabilities, and for particles with negligible or signiﬁcant settling velocity. A new model relating the net surface ﬂux to the vertical concentration proﬁle that accounts for both atmospheric stability and particle settling velocity is proposed. The model compares well with the simulation results for all particle sizes and atmospheric stability conditions evaluated, and it can be used to estimate the concentration proﬁle based on the surface ﬂux, and also to estimate the surface ﬂux by ﬁtting the vertical concentration proﬁle. The resulting equation can be considered as an extension of MoninObukhov similarity theory to the concentration of settling particles, such as mineral dust, sea-salt, pollen and other suspended aerosols.},

	abstract = {The theoretical solution for concentration profiles of particles in aeolian suspension above large beds of loose particles is re-examined. It is argued that the solution generally found in the literature is based on an erroneous boundary condition at the surface of the particle bed. A revised boundary condition is suggested and this leads to a new equation for particle concentration profiles in the one-dimensional zone. The profiles are a two-parameter family. The parameters are the ratio of particle settling velocity to wind friction velocity and a concentration ratio. Crude estimates of the latter parameter are available from a formula derived in the paper. The new profile equation is supported by experimental data. Also, unlike the old equation, it gives the expected logarithmic concentration profiles in the limiting case of very fine particles.},

The snow motion is analysed in both Eulerian and Lagrangian frameworks by large-scale particle imaging, while sonic anemometry is used to characterize the flow field. Additionally, the snowflake size and morphology are assessed by digital in-line holography. The low volume fraction and mass loading imply a one-way interaction with the turbulent air. Acceleration probability density functions show wide exponential tails consistent with laboratory and numerical studies of homogeneous isotropic turbulence. Invoking the assumption that the particle acceleration has a stronger dependence on the Stokes number than on the specific features of the turbulence (e.g. precise Reynolds number and large-scale anisotropy), we make inferences on the snowflakes’ aerodynamic response time. In particular, we observe that their acceleration distribution is consistent with that of particles of Stokes number in the range

The still-air terminal velocities estimated for the resulting range of aerodynamic response times are significantly smaller than the measured snow particle fall speed.

The estimates of the Stokes number and the correlation between vertical velocity and local concentration are consistent with the view that the enhanced settling is rooted in the preferential sweeping mechanism. When the snow vertical velocity is large compared to the characteristic turbulence velocity, the crossing trajectories effect results in strong accelerations. When the conditions of preferential sweeping are met, the concentration field is highly non-uniform and clustering appears over a wide range of scales. These clusters, identified for the first time in a naturally occurring flow, display the signature features seen in canonical settings: power-law size distribution, fractal-like shape, vertical elongation and large fall speed that increases with the cluster size. These findings demonstrate that the fundamental phenomenology of particle-laden turbulence can be leveraged towards a better predictive understanding of snow precipitation and ground snow accumulation. They also demonstrate how environmental flows can be used to investigate dispersed multiphase flows at Reynolds numbers not accessible in laboratory experiments or numerical simulations.},

	abstract = {Information about sea spray aerosol particle transport and their vertical distribution in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) is important in marine meteorological forecasting and geobiochemical models. However, due to diﬃculties in ﬁeld observations, values of aerosol concentration are often limited to point measurements, and obtaining the size-resolved concentration proﬁles is quite challenging. Hence, numerical and analytical studies are vital in modeling the transport of aerosols in the atmospheric boundary layer and beyond. Due to their coarse resolution, most mesoscale and global aerosol models do not accurately resolve the sea spray and aerosol concentrations in the MABL, especially in the surface layer. The objective of the present study is to develop a relatively simple, one-dimensional analytical model to calculate concentration proﬁles of aerosols in the MABL. In this study, a new analytical model relating surface ﬂux to vertical concentration proﬁle in the MABL is proposed. The model accounts for the diﬀerent atmospheric stability and particle settling velocity, thus providing size-resolved vertical proﬁles of aerosol concentration. The equations developed here extend the surface layer similarity models to the mixed layer. Model results are compared to aerosol concentration proﬁles emitted from a surface source obtained from large eddy simulations, for both neutral and unstable atmospheric stability and for particle sizes ranging from 1 to 30 μm. Though the model is developed for sea spray aerosols, it can be used to calculate vertical concentration proﬁles for other types of settling particles, including dust and sand particles in the atmospheric boundary layer.},

Large droplets remain close to the ocean surface and affect the air-sea fluxes of momentum and enthalpy, thereby enhancing the intensity of tropical cyclones.

            Wind ripples decorate the flanks of dunes in amazingly regular patterns, on both Earth and Mars. Their emergence at a wavelength much larger than the grain size is currently unexplained. We report direct numerical simulations of grains interacting with a wind flow that are, for the first time to our knowledge, able to reproduce the spontaneous growth of ripples with an initial wavelength and a propagation velocity linearly increasing with the wind speed. We propose a new formation mechanism, involving resonant grain trajectories tuned with the ripple wavelength. We also show that the product of the ripple wavelength and velocity is a proxy for the sediment flux, opening a promising perspective from which to perform remote measurements of sand mass transfers, on Mars in particular.
          , 
            Aeolian sand beds exhibit regular patterns of ripples resulting from the interaction between topography and sediment transport. Their characteristics have been so far related to reptation transport caused by the impacts on the ground of grains entrained by the wind into saltation. By means of direct numerical simulations of grains interacting with a wind flow, we show that the instability turns out to be driven by resonant grain trajectories, whose length is close to a ripple wavelength and whose splash leads to a mass displacement toward the ripple crests. The pattern selection results from a compromise between this destabilizing mechanism and a diffusive downslope transport which stabilizes small wavelengths. The initial wavelength is set by the ratio of the sediment flux and the erosion/deposition rate, a ratio which increases linearly with the wind velocity. We show that this scaling law, in agreement with experiments, originates from an interfacial layer separating the saltation zone from the static sand bed, where momentum transfers are dominated by midair collisions. Finally, we provide quantitative support for the use of the propagation of these ripples as a proxy for remote measurements of sediment transport.},

	abstract = {This paper examines the combined inﬂuences of turbulence and gravity on droplet collision statistics in turbulent clouds by means of direct numerical simulation (DNS). The essential microphysical mechanisms that determine the geometric collision kernel are explored by studying how gravity affects droplet relative velocities and preferential concentration of both monodisperse and bidisperse droplet distributions. To this end, collision statistics of large amounts of droplets with radii ranging from 10 to 90 mm, driven by a turbulent ﬂow ﬁeld and gravity, are calculated. The ﬂow is homogeneous and isotropic and has a dissipation rate of e 5 4.25 3 1022 m2 s23. The results show that in the calculation of collision statistics, the interplay between gravity and turbulence is an essential element and not merely an addition of separate phenomena. For example, the presence of gravity leads to clustering of large droplets interacting with the larger scales of turbulence in the DNS. The collision statistics of a bidisperse droplet distribution, even with a very small radius difference, shows profoundly different behavior than the monodisperse case.},

              5
              for a typical convective cloud, with a corresponding large-eddy Reynolds number on the order of 10

              7
              . A characteristic trait of high-Reynolds-number turbulence is strong intermittency in energy dissipation, Lagrangian acceleration, and scalar gradients at small scales. Microscale properties of clouds are determined to a great extent by thermodynamic and fluid-mechanical interactions between droplets and the surrounding air, all of which take place at small spatial scales. Furthermore, these microscale properties of clouds affect the efficiency with which clouds produce rain as well as the nature of their interaction with atmospheric radiation and chemical species. It is expected, therefore, that fine-scale turbulence is of direct importance to the evolution of, for example, the droplet size distribution in a cloud. In general, there are two levels of interaction that are considered in this review: (a) the growth of cloud droplets by condensation and (b) the growth of large drops through the collision and coalescence of cloud droplets. Recent research suggests that the influence of fine-scale turbulence on the condensation process may be limited, although several possible mechanisms have not been studied in detail in the laboratory or the field. There is a growing consensus, however, that the collision rate and collision efficiency of cloud droplets can be increased by turbulence-particle interactions. Adding strength to this notion is the growing experimental evidence for droplet clustering at centimeter scales and below, most likely due to strong fluid accelerations in turbulent clouds. Both types of interaction, condensation and collision-coalescence, remain open areas of research with many possible implications for the physics of atmospheric clouds.},

              , vol. 796, 2016, pp. 617–658), we analysed the motion of inertial particles in isotropic turbulence in the absence of gravity using direct numerical simulation (DNS). Here, in Part 2, we introduce gravity and study its effect on single-particle and particle-pair dynamics over a wide range of flow Reynolds numbers, Froude numbers and particle Stokes numbers. The overall goal of this study is to explore the mechanisms affecting particle collisions, and to thereby improve our understanding of droplet interactions in atmospheric clouds. We find that the dynamics of heavy particles falling under gravity can be artificially influenced by the finite domain size and the periodic boundary conditions, and we therefore perform our simulations on larger domains to reduce these effects. We first study single-particle statistics that influence the relative positions and velocities of inertial particles. We see that gravity causes particles to sample the flow more uniformly and reduces the time particles can spend interacting with the underlying turbulence. We also find that gravity tends to increase inertial particle accelerations, and we introduce a model to explain that effect. We then analyse the particle relative velocities and radial distribution functions (RDFs), which are generally seen to be independent of Reynolds number for low and moderate Kolmogorov-scale Stokes numbers

              . We see that gravity causes particle relative velocities to decrease by reducing the degree of preferential sampling and the importance of path-history interactions, and that the relative velocities have higher scaling exponents with gravity. We observe that gravity has a non-trivial effect on clustering, acting to decrease clustering at low

              New J. Phys.
              , vol. 11, 2009, 103018), we provide an explanation for this non-trivial effect of gravity. We also show that when the effects of gravity are accounted for in the theory of Zaichik \& Alipchenkov (2009), the results compare favourably with DNS. The relative velocities and RDFs exhibit considerable anisotropy at small separations, and this anisotropy is quantified using spherical harmonic functions. We use the relative velocities and the RDFs to compute the particle collision kernels, and find that the collision kernel remains as it was for the case without gravity, namely nearly independent of Reynolds number for low and moderate

	abstract = {In a seminal article, Maxey (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 174, 1987, pp. 441–465) presented a theoretical analysis showing that enhanced particle settling speeds in turbulence occur through the preferential sweeping mechanism, which depends on the preferential sampling of the ﬂuid velocity gradient ﬁeld by the inertial particles. However, recent direct numerical simulation (DNS) results in Ireland et al. (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 796, 2016b, pp. 659–711) show that even in a portion of the parameter space where this preferential sampling is absent, the particles nevertheless exhibit enhanced settling velocities. Further, there are several outstanding questions concerning the role of different turbulent ﬂow scales on the enhanced settling, and the role of the Taylor Reynolds number Rλ. The analysis of Maxey does not explain these issues, partly since it was restricted to particle Stokes numbers St 1. To address these issues, we have developed a new theoretical result, valid for arbitrary St, that reveals the multiscale nature of the mechanism generating the enhanced settling speeds. In particular, it shows how the range of scales at which the preferential sweeping mechanism operates depends on St. This analysis is complemented by results from DNS where we examine the role of different ﬂow scales on the particle settling speeds by coarse graining the underlying ﬂow. The results show how the ﬂow scales that contribute to the enhanced settling depend on St, and that contrary to previous claims, there can be no single turbulent velocity scale that characterizes the enhanced settling speed. The results explain the dependence of the particle settling speeds on Rλ, and show how the saturation of this dependence at sufﬁciently large Rλ depends upon St. The results also show that as the Stokes settling velocity of the particles is increased, the ﬂow scales of the turbulence responsible for enhancing the particle settling speed become larger. Finally, we explored the multiscale nature of the preferential sweeping mechanism by considering how particles preferentially sample the ﬂuid velocity gradients coarse grained at various scales. The results show that while rapidly settling particles do not preferentially sample the ﬂuid velocity gradients, they do preferentially sample the ﬂuid velocity gradients coarse grained at scales outside of the dissipation range. This explains the ﬁndings of Ireland et al., and further illustrates the truly multiscale nature of the mechanism generating enhanced particle settling speeds in turbulence.},

	abstract = {Our objective is to explain recent Lagrangian acceleration measurements of inertial particles in decaying, nearly isotropic turbulence [Ayyalasomayajula et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 97, 144507 (2006)]. These experiments showed that as particle inertial effects increased, the variance in the particle acceleration fluctuations was reduced, and the tails of the normalized particle acceleration probability density function (PDF) became systematically attenuated. We model this phenomenon using a base flow that consists of a two-dimensional array of evenly spaced vortices with signs and intensities that vary randomly in time. We simulate a large sample of inertial particles moving through the fluid without disturbing the flow (one-way coupling). Consistent with Bec et al. [J. Fluid Mech. 550, 349 (2006)], we find that our model exhibits preferential concentration or clustering of particles in regions located away from the vortex centers. That is, inertial particles selectively sample the flow field, oversampling regions with high strains and undersampling regions with high vorticities. At low Stokes numbers, this biased “sampling” of the flow is responsible for the reduction in the acceleration variance and partially explains the attenuation of the tails of the acceleration PDF. However, contrary to previous findings, we show that the tails of the PDF are also diminished by “filtering” induced by the attenuated response of the inertial particles to temporal variations in the fluid acceleration: Inertial particles do not respond to fluctuations with frequencies much higher than the inverse of the particle stopping time. We show that larger fluid acceleration events have higher frequencies and hence experience greater filtering by particle inertia. We contrast the vortex model with previous Lagrangian acceleration models by Sawford [Phys. Fluids A 3, 1577 (1991)] and Reynolds [Phys. Fluids 15, L1 (2003)] and show that although these models capture some aspects of the inertial particle behavior, it is necessary to employ a model of the flow with spatial structure to capture the effect of sampling on the inertial particle dynamics.},

	abstract = {As intermediate quantities available from various existing numerical computations, the fluid Lagrangian time scales are of primary importance in the development of probability density function models for turbulent flows. Similarly, the time scales of the fluid seen by discrete particles in two-phase flows are essential for the development of dispersion models based on stochastic differential equations. Such time scales are obviously depending not only on the particle properties but also on the fluid Lagrangian and Eulerian time scales. A model is proposed here to estimate the directional dependence of the fluid Lagrangian time scales and drift coefficients in one-directional equilibrium turbulent shear flows, based on a local homogeneity assumption in the frame of the generalized Langevin model. Through comparison with available direct and large eddy simulation predictions in channel flows and in a homogeneous shear flow, the model is shown to lead to significant improvements in the streamwise and spanwise directions, where the existing empirical laws for the Lagrangian time scales are far from being satisfactory. We examine the way this model can be used to build a suitable stochastic process for the fluid seen by inertial particles in such basic turbulent shear flows.},
