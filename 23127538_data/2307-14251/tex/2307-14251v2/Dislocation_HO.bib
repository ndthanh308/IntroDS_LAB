	abstract = {We present a new model of a one-dimensional nonrelativistic canonical quantum harmonic oscillator which is semiconfined. Semiconfinement is achieved by replacing the constant effective mass with a mass that varies with position. The problem is exactly solvable and the analytic expression of the wavefunctions of the stationary states is expressed by means of generalized Laguerre polynomials. Surprisingly, the energy spectrum completely overlaps with the energy spectrum of the standard nonrelativistic canonical quantum harmonic oscillator. In the limit when the semiconfinement parameter a goes to infinity, the wavefunctions also tend to the wavefunction of the standard oscillator in terms of Hermite polynomials.},

@article{GOMEZULLATE2010987,
	abstract = {We prove an extension of Bochner's classical result that characterizes the classical polynomial families as eigenfunctions of a second-order differential operator with polynomial coefficients. The extended result involves considering differential operators with rational coefficients and the requirement is that they have a numerable sequence of polynomial eigenfunctions p1,p2,{\ldots} of all degrees except for degree zero. The main theorem of the paper provides a characterization of all such differential operators. The existence of such differential operators and polynomial sequences is based on the concept of exceptional polynomial subspaces, and the converse part of the main theorem rests on the classification of codimension one exceptional subspaces under projective transformations, which is performed in this paper.},

	abstract = {We present two infinite sequences of polynomial eigenfunctions of a Sturm--Liouville problem. As opposed to the classical orthogonal polynomial systems, these sequences start with a polynomial of degree one. We denote these polynomials as X1-Jacobi and X1-Laguerre and we prove that they are orthogonal with respect to a positive definite inner product defined over the compact interval [−1,1] or the half-line [0,∞), respectively, and they are a basis of the corresponding L2 Hilbert spaces. Moreover, we prove a converse statement similar to Bochner's theorem for the classical orthogonal polynomial systems: if a self-adjoint second-order operator has a complete set of polynomial eigenfunctions {pi}i=1∞, then it must be either the X1-Jacobi or the X1-Laguerre Sturm--Liouville problem. A Rodrigues-type formula can be derived for both of the X1 polynomial sequences.},

In a broader methodical context, the innovation involves Schr{\"o}dinger equations which are piecewise analytic and piecewise solvable in terms of special (in our illustrative example, Whittaker) functions. In a practical implementation of our symbolic-manipulation-based approach, we work with a non-analyticity in the origin. A persuasive advantage is then found in the both-sidedness of our iterative localization of the energies. },

	abstract = {We study the SWKB quantization conditions for two classes of exactly solvable quantum mechanical systems: one is the system whose eigenfunctions contain the multi-indexed polynomials as the main parts and the other is obtained through the Krein--Adler transformation. We show that the condition equation is always independent of {\$}{\$}{\backslash}hbar {\$}{\$}ħand the condition is not exactly satisfied but holds with a certain degree of accuracy. These results are based on our previous work [12]. A brief review on exactly solvable quantum mechanics is also presented.},

It is shown that this operator can always be represented as a product of N first-order Darboux transformation operators. The relationship between this transformation and the factorization method is investigated. Supercharge operators are introduced. They are differential operators of order N. It is shown that these operators and super-Hamiltonian form a superalgebra of order N. For N=2, we have a quadratic superalgebra analogous to the Sklyanin quadratic algebras. The relationship between the transformation introduced and the inverse scattering problem in quantum mechanics is established. An elementary N-parametric potential that has exactly N predetermined discrete spectrum levels is constructed. The paper concludes with some examples of new exactly soluble potentials.},

@article{COOPER1995267,
	abstract = {In the past ten years, the ideas of supersymmetry have been profitably applied to many nonrelativistic quantum mechanical problems. In particular, there is now a much deeper understanding of why certain potentials are analytically solvable and an array of powerful new approximation methods for handling potentials which are not exactly solvable. In this report, we review the theoretical formulation of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and discuss many applications. Exactly solvable potentials can be understood in terms of a few basic ideas which include supersymmetric partner potentials, shape invariance and operator transformations. Familiar solvable potentials all have the property of shape invariance. We describe new exactly solvable shape invariant potentials which include the recently discovered self-similar potentials as a special case. The connection between inverse scattering, isospectral potentials and supersymmetric quantum mechanics is discussed and multisoliton solutions of the KdV equation are constructed. Approximation methods are also discussed within the framework of supersymmetric quantum mechanics and in particular it is shown that a supersymmetry inspired WKB approximation is exact for a class of shape invariant potentials. Supersymmetry ideas give particularly nice results for the tunneling rate in a double well potential and for improving large N expansions. We also discuss the problem of a charged Dirac particle in an external magnetic field and other potentials in terms of supersymmetric quantum mechanics. Finally, we discuss structures more general than supersymmetric quantum mechanics such as parasupersymmetric quantum mechanics in which there is a symmetry between a boson and a para-fermion of order p.},
