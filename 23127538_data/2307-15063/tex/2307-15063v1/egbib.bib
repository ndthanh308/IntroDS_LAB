	abstract = {Deep networks have been successfully applied to learn transferable features for adapting models from a source domain to a different target domain. In this paper, we present joint adaptation networks ({JAN}), which learn a transfer network by aligning the joint distributions of multiple domain-speciﬁc layers across domains based on a joint maximum mean discrepancy ({JMMD}) criterion. Adversarial training strategy is adopted to maximize {JMMD} such that the distributions of the source and target domains are made more distinguishable. Learning can be performed by stochastic gradient descent with the gradients computed by back-propagation in linear-time. Experiments testify that our model yields state of the art results on standard datasets.},

	abstract = {Unsupervised Domain Adaptation ({UDA}) makes predictions for the target domain data while manual annotations are only available in the source domain. Previous methods minimize the domain discrepancy neglecting the class information, which may lead to misalignment and poor generalization performance. To address this issue, this paper proposes Contrastive Adaptation Network ({CAN}) optimizing a new metric which explicitly models the intra-class domain discrepancy and the inter-class domain discrepancy. We design an alternating update strategy for training {CAN} in an end-to-end manner. Experiments on two real-world benchmarks Ofﬁce-31 and {VisDA}-2017 demonstrate that {CAN} performs favorably against the state-of-the-art methods and produces more discriminative features.},

abstract = {Detecting changes in a data stream is an important area of research with many applications. In this paper, we present a novel method for the detection and estimation of change. In addition to providing statistical guarantees on the reliability of detected changes, our method also provides meaningful descriptions and quantification of these changes. Our approach assumes that the points in the stream are independently generated, but otherwise makes no assumptions on the nature of the generating distribution. Thus our techniques work for both continuous and discrete data. In an experimental study we demonstrate the power of our techniques.},
