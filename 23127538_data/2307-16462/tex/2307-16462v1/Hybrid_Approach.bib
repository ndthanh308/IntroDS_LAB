    abstract = {Driver behavior impacts traffic safety, fuel/energy consumption and gas emissions. Driver behavior profiling tries to understand and positively impact driver behavior. Usually driver behavior profiling tasks involve automated collection of driving data and application of computer models to generate a classification that characterizes the driver aggressiveness profile. Different sensors and classification methods have been employed in this task, however, low-cost solutions and high performance are still research targets. This paper presents an investigation with different Android smartphone sensors, and classification algorithms in order to assess which sensor/method assembly enables classification with higher performance. The results show that specific combinations of sensors and intelligent methods allow classification performance improvement.},

Smartphone-based driving behavior monitoring has applications in the insurance industry, fleet management, driver training, and for law enforcement. In this paper we propose a Maximum Likelihood (ML) classifier to identify and classify the recklessness of driving maneuvers using the embedded sensors and GPS receiver of a smartphone. We compare the developed approach to the commonly used Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) based method. The solutions are both suitable for real-time applications, such as driver assistance and safety systems. An endpoint detection algorithm is used on filtered accelerometer and gyroscope data to find the start- and endpoints of driving events. The events are isolated with the endpoint detection algorithm are then classified using the DTW algorithm and an ML classifier. Results show that the ML classifier outperforms the DTW approach.},  keywords={},  doi={10.1109/SSCI.2015.70},  ISSN={},  month={December},}

abstract = {The present work investigates the use of smartphones as an alternative to gather data for driving behavior analysis. The proposed approach incorporates i. a device reorientation algorithm, which leverages gyroscope, accelerometer and GPS information, to correct the raw accelerometer data, and ii. a machine-learning framework based on rough set theory to identify rules and detect critical patterns solely based on the corrected accelerometer data. To evaluate the proposed framework, a series of driving experiments are conducted in both controlled and “free-driving” conditions. In all experiments, the smartphone can be freely positioned inside the subject vehicle. Findings indicate that the smartphone-based algorithms may accurately detect four distinct patterns (braking, acceleration, left cornering and right cornering) with an average accuracy comparable to other popular detection approaches based on data collected using a fixed position device.}
