abstract="A fundamental problem in analysing biological networks is the identification of dense subgraphs, since they are considered to be related to relevant parts of networks, like communities. Many contributions have been focused mainly in computing a single dense subgraph, but in many applications we are interested in finding a set of dense, possibly overlapping, subgraphs. In this paper we consider the Top-k-Overlapping Densest Subgraphs problem, that aims at finding a set of k dense subgraphs, for some integer {\$}{\$}k {\backslash}ge 1{\$}{\$}, that maximize an objective function that consists of the density of the subgraphs and the distance among them. We design a new heuristic for the Top-k-Overlapping Densest Subgraphs and we present an experimental analysis that compares our heuristic with an approximation algorithm developed for Top-k-Overlapping Densest Subgraphs (called DOS) on biological networks. The experimental result shows that our heuristic provides solutions that are denser than those computed by DOS, while the solutions computed by DOS have a greater distance. As for time-complexity, the DOS algorithm is much faster than our method.",

abstract = {In many applications we have a social network of people and would like to identify the members of an interesting but unlabeled group or community. We start with a small number of exemplar group members -- they may be followers of a political ideology or fans of a music genre -- and need to use those examples to discover the additional members. This problem gives rise to the seed expansion problem in community detection: given example community members, how can the social graph be used to predict the identities of remaining, hidden community members? In contrast with global community detection (graph partitioning or covering), seed expansion is best suited for identifying communities locally concentrated around nodes of interest. A growing body of work has used seed expansion as a scalable means of detecting overlapping communities. Yet despite growing interest in seed expansion, there are divergent approaches in the literature and there still isn't a systematic understanding of which approaches work best in different domains. Here we evaluate several variants and uncover subtle trade-offs between different approaches. We explore which properties of the seed set can improve performance, focusing on heuristics that one can control in practice. As a consequence of this systematic understanding we have found several opportunities for performance gains. We also consider an adaptive version in which requests are made for additional membership labels of particular nodes, such as one finds in field studies of social communities. This leads to interesting connections and contrasts with active learning and the trade-offs of exploration and exploitation. Finally, we explore topological properties of communities and seed sets that correlate with algorithm performance, and explain these empirical observations with theoretical ones. We evaluate our methods across multiple domains, using publicly available datasets with labeled, ground-truth communities.},

In this paper we study the novel problem of finding a minimum Wiener connector: given a connected graph G=(V,E) and a set Q ⊆ V of query vertices, find a subgraph of G that connects all query vertices and has minimum Wiener index.We show that MIN WIENER CONNECTOR admits a polynomial-time (albeit impractical) exact algorithm for the special case where the number of query vertices is bounded. We show that in general the problem is NP-hard, and has no PTAS unless P = NP. Our main contribution is a constant-factor approximation algorithm running in time \~{O}(|Q||E|).A thorough experimentation on a large variety of real-world graphs confirms that our method returns smaller and denser solutions than other methods, and does so by adding to the query set Q a small number of ``important'' vertices (i.e., vertices with high centrality).},

For example, this node could be the common advisor, or someone who started the research area that the Q nodes belong to. Isomorphic scenarios appear in law enforcement (find the master-mind criminal, connected to all current suspects), gene regulatory networks (find the protein that participates in pathways with all or most of the given Q proteins), viral marketing and many more.Connection subgraphs is an important first step, handling the case of Q=2 query nodes. Then, the connection subgraph algorithm finds the b intermediate nodes, that provide a good connection between the two original query nodes.Here we generalize the challenge in multiple dimensions: First, we allow more than two query nodes. Second, we allow a whole family of queries, ranging from 'OR' to 'AND', with 'softAND' in-between. Finally, we design and compare a fast approximation, and study the quality/speed trade-off.We also present experiments on the DBLP dataset. The experiments confirm that our proposed method naturally deals with multi-source queries and that the resulting subgraphs agree with our intuition. Wall-clock timing results on the DBLP dataset show that our proposed approximation achieve good accuracy for about 6:1 speedup.},

abstract = {Community search is the problem of finding a good community for a given set of query vertices. One of the most studied formulations of community search asks for a connected subgraph that contains all query vertices and maximizes the minimum degree. All existing approaches to min-degree-based community search suffer from limitations concerning efficiency, as they need to visit (large part of) the whole input graph, as well as accuracy, as they output communities quite large and not really cohesive. Moreover, some existing methods lack generality: they handle only single-vertex queries, find communities that are not optimal in terms of minimum degree, and/or require input parameters. In this work we advance the state of the art on community search by proposing a novel method that overcomes all these limitations: it is in general more efficient and effective--one/two orders of magnitude on average, it can handle multiple query vertices, it yields optimal communities, and it is parameter-free. These properties are confirmed by an extensive experimental analysis performed on various real-world graphs.},

abstract = {Community search is important in social network analysis. For a given vertex in a graph, the goal is to find the best community the vertex belongs to. Intuitively, the best community for a given vertex should be in the vicinity of the vertex. However, existing solutions use emph{global search} to find the best community. These algorithms, although straight-forward, are very costly, as all vertices in the graph may need to be visited. In this paper, we propose a emph{local search} strategy, which searches in the neighborhood of a vertex to find the best community for the vertex. We show that, because the minimum degree measure used to evaluate the goodness of a community is not emph{monotonic}, designing efficient local search solutions is a very challenging task. We present theories and algorithms of local search to address this challenge. The efficiency of our local search strategy is verified by extensive experiments on both synthetic networks and a variety of real networks with millions of nodes.},

Our structure, Fibonacci heaps (abbreviated F-heaps), extends the binomial queues proposed by Vuillemin and studied further by Brown. F-heaps support arbitrary deletion from an n-item heap in O(log n) amortized time and all other standard heap operations in O(1) amortized time. Using F-heaps we are able to obtain improved running times for several network optimization algorithms. In particular, we obtain the following worst-case bounds, where n is the number of vertices and m the number of edges in the problem graph: O(n log n + m) for the single-source shortest path problem with nonnegative edge lengths, improved from O(mlog(m/n+2)n);  O(n2log n + nm) for the all-pairs shortest path problem, improved from O(nm log(m/n+2)n);  O(n2log n + nm) for the assignment problem (weighted bipartite matching), improved from O(nmlog(m/n+2)n);  O(mβ(m, n)) for the minimum spanning tree problem, improved from O(mlog log(m/n+2)n); where β(m, n) = min {i | log(i)n ≤ m/n}. Note that β(m, n) ≤ log*n if m ≥ n.  Of these results, the improved bound for minimum spanning trees is the most striking, although all the results give asymptotic improvements for graphs of appropriate densities.},

Identifying those topics is not only interesting from a societal point of view but also allows the filtering and aggregation of social media content for disseminating news stories. In this article, we perform a systematic methodological study of controversy detection by using the content and the network structure of social media.Unlike previous work, rather than studying controversy in a single hand-picked topic and using domain-specific knowledge, we take a general approach to study topics in any domain. Our approach to quantifying controversy is based on a graph-based three-stage pipeline, which involves (i) building a conversation graph about a topic, (ii) partitioning the conversation graph to identify potential sides of the controversy, and (iii)&nbsp;measuring the amount of controversy from characteristics of the graph.We perform an extensive comparison of controversy measures, different graph-building approaches, and data sources. We use both controversial and non-controversial topics on Twitter, as well as other external datasets. We find that our new random-walk-based measure outperforms existing ones in capturing the intuitive notion of controversy and show that content features are vastly less helpful in this task.},

publisher = {Association for Computing Machinery},
abstract = {Society is often polarized by controversial issues that split the population into groups with opposing views. When such issues emerge on social media, we often observe the creation of `echo chambers', i.e., situations where like-minded people reinforce each other's opinion, but do not get exposed to the views of the opposing side. In this paper we study algorithmic techniques for bridging these chambers, and thus reduce controversy. Specifically, we represent the discussion on a controversial issue with an endorsement graph, and cast our problem as an edge-recommendation problem on this graph. The goal of the recommendation is to reduce the controversy score of the graph, which is measured by a recently-developed metric based on random walks. At the same time, we take into account the acceptance probability of the recommended edge, which represents how likely the edge is to materialize in the endorsement graph.We propose a simple model based on a recently-developed user-level controversy score, that is competitive with state-of-the-art link-prediction algorithms. Our goal then becomes finding the edges that produce the largest reduction in the controversy score, in expectation. To solve this problem, we propose an efficient algorithm that considers only a fraction of all the possible combinations of edges. Experimental results show that our algorithm is more efficient than a simple greedy heuristic, while producing comparable score reduction. Finally, a comparison with other state-of-the-art edge-addition algorithms shows that this problem is fundamentally different from what has been studied in the literature.},

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a new framework for approximately solving flow problems in capacitated, undirected graphs and apply it to provide asymptotically faster algorithms for the maximum s-t flow and maximum concurrent multicommodity flow problems. For graphs with n vertices and m edges, it allows us to find an ε-approximate maximum s-t flow in time O(m1+o(1)ε-2), improving on the previous best bound of \~{O}(mn1/3poly(ε-1)). Applying the same framework in the multicommodity setting solves a maximum concurrent multicommodity flow problem with k commodities in O(m1+o(1)ε-2k2) time, improving on the existing bound of \~{O}(m4/3poly(k&gt;,ε-1)).Our algorithms utilize several new technical tools that we believe may be of independent interest:• We give a non-Euclidean generalization of gradient descent and provide bounds on its performance. Using this, we show how to reduce approximate maximum flow and maximum concurrent flow to oblivious routing.• We define and provide an efficient construction of a new type of flow sparsifier. Previous sparsifier constructions approximately preserved the size of cuts and, by duality, the value of the maximum flows as well. However, they did not provide any direct way to route flows in the sparsifier G' back in the original graph G, leading to a longstanding gap between the efficacy of sparsification on flow and cut problems. We ameliorate this by constructing a sparsifier G' that can be embedded (very efficiently) into G with low congestion, allowing one to transfer flows from G' back to G.• We give the first almost-linear-time construction of an O(mo(1))-competitive oblivious routing scheme. No previous such algorithm ran in time better than Ω(mn). By reducing the running time to almost-linear, our work provides a powerful new primitive for constructing very fast graph algorithms.The interested reader is referred to the full version of the paper [8] for a more complete treatment of these results.},

abstract = {We describe the University of Florida Sparse Matrix Collection, a large and actively growing set of sparse matrices that arise in real applications. The Collection is widely used by the numerical linear algebra community for the development and performance evaluation of sparse matrix algorithms. It allows for robust and repeatable experiments: robust because performance results with artificially generated matrices can be misleading, and repeatable because matrices are curated and made publicly available in many formats. Its matrices cover a wide spectrum of domains, include those arising from problems with underlying 2D or 3D geometry (as structural engineering, computational fluid dynamics, model reduction, electromagnetics, semiconductor devices, thermodynamics, materials, acoustics, computer graphics/vision, robotics/kinematics, and other discretizations) and those that typically do not have such geometry (optimization, circuit simulation, economic and financial modeling, theoretical and quantum chemistry, chemical process simulation, mathematics and statistics, power networks, and other networks and graphs). We provide software for accessing and managing the Collection, from MATLAB™, Mathematica™, Fortran, and C, as well as an online search capability. Graph visualization of the matrices is provided, and a new multilevel coarsening scheme is proposed to facilitate this task.},

abstract = {Given a simple undirected graph G=(V,E) and a constant @c@__ __(0,1), a subset of vertices is called a @c-quasi-clique or, simply, a @c-clique if it induces a subgraph with the edge density of at least @c. The maximum @c-clique problem consists in finding a @c-clique of largest cardinality in the graph. Despite numerous practical applications, this problem has not been rigorously studied from the mathematical perspective, and no exact solution methods have been proposed in the literature. This paper, for the first time, establishes some fundamental properties of the maximum @c-clique problem, including the NP-completeness of its decision version for any fixed @c satisfying 0&lt;@c&lt;1, the quasi-heredity property, and analytical upper bounds on the size of a maximum @c-clique. Moreover, mathematical programming formulations of the problem are proposed and results of preliminary numerical experiments using a state-of-the-art optimization solver to find exact solutions are presented.},

abstract = {We describe a local algorithm for finding subgraphs with high density, according to a measure of density introduced by Kannan and Vinay [1999]. The algorithm takes as input a bipartite graph G, a starting vertex v, and a parameter k, and outputs an induced subgraph of G. It is local in the sense that it does not examine the entire input graph; instead, it adaptively explores a region of the graph near the starting vertex. The running time of the algorithm is bounded by O(Δ k2), which depends on the maximum degree Δ, but is otherwise independent of the graph. We prove the following approximation guarantee: for any subgraph S with k′ vertices and density θ, there exists a set S′ ⊆ S for which the algorithm outputs a subgraph with density Ω(θ/log Δ) whenever v ∈ S′ and k ≥ k′. We prove that S′ contains at least half of the edges in S.},
