\Cref{fig:distance_methods_app} shows the distribution of symmetric differences between original and counterfactual graphs ($d_{\%}$) and of computation times (\textit{I}), for each method, for ADHDF (1st row), OHSU (2nd row), PEK (3rd row), and KKI (4th row).

\Cref{fig:example2_bis} compares the counterfactual graphs found by \edg, \rcli, \dataset, and \datasetbw, for patient $22$ in ADHD. The figure shows both the connectome of the patient with the changes highlighted in red (edges removed) and in blue (edges added), and the barplots indicating to which brain lobes the ROIs of the edges added (in blue) and removed (in red) belong (as percentages).
