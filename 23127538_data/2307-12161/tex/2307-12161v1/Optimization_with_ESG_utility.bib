keywords = {Sustainability indexes, Socially responsible investments, Voluntary social and environmental initiatives, Sustainability strategies, Pays to be green debate},
abstract = {In the past decade, indicators have been created to assess the sustainability performance of companies listed in stock exchange markets. Academics and practitioners expect companies to benefit from being listed in such indexes, but evidence of value creation is still scarce. Since virtually all studies about the Corporate Sustainability Index (ISE) of the São Paulo Stock Exchange (Brazil) – the object of the present study – focused on the value of shares, we initially looked for answers in the finance theory. We collected secondary data about the financial and economic performance of companies forming the ISE's ‘theoretical portfolio’, as these kinds of indexes are also known. In a second stage, we sought additional motivations for companies to make efforts to be listed in the index. We collected additional data and interviewed representatives of key companies listed in the ISE, as well as industry leaders who chose not to participate in the selection process. The results support the main propositions of the institutional theory, as well as the ‘pays to be green’ literature – that the intangible value created by voluntary environmental initiatives, such as access to knowledge, new capabilities and reputational gain, better explain the efforts companies make to be listed in the ISE index.}

author = {Lammertjan Dam and Bert Scholtens},
keywords = {Socially responsible investing, Corporate social performance, Market-to-book, Return on assets, Stock market return},
abstract = {Studies that link corporate social and financial performance usually find a positive association between the two. However, the literature does not establish a significant impact of socially responsible investing on stock market returns. We develop a coherent economic framework of responsible investing to address this paradox. The framework offers theoretical underpinnings for all research on responsible investment as it provides the theoretical underpinnings for the actual behavior of market participants. We associate corporate social performance with key financial accounting ratios like the market-to-book ratio (market value of the firm in relation to accounting value), return on assets, and stock market return. We conclude that there is a strong theoretical foundation for a positive relationship between corporate social responsibility and financial performance, though the relation is conditional on which financial performance measure is considered. We illustrate that the empirical literature about responsible investing is well in line with our model's propositions.}

number = {2},
pages = {158-185},
abstract = {With a meta-analysis of 85 studies and 190 experiments, the authors test the relationship between socially responsible investing (SRI) and financial performance to determine whether including corporate social responsibility and ethical concerns in portfolio management is more profitable than conventional investment policies. The study also analyses the influence of researcher methodologies with respect to several dimensions of SRI (markets, financial performance measures, investment horizons, SRI thematic approaches, family investments and journal impact) on the effects identified. The results indicate that the consideration of corporate social responsibility in stock market portfolios is neither a weakness nor a strength compared with conventional investments; the heterogeneous results in prior studies largely reflect the SRI dimensions under study (e.g. thematic approach, investment horizon and data comparison method).},
