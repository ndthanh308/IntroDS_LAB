  "abstract": "Since the initial measurements of single-top quark production at the Tevatron in 2009, tremendous progress has been made at the LHC. While LHC Run 1 marked the beginning of a precision era for the single-top quark measurements in some of the main production mechanisms, LHC Run 2 witnessed the emergence and exploration of new processes associating top quark production with a neutral boson. In this paper, we review the measurements of the three main production mechanisms ($t$-channel, $s$-channel, and $tW$ production), and of the associated production with a photon, a $Z$ boson, or a Higgs boson. Differential cross-sections are measured for several of these processes and compared with theoretical predictions. The top quark properties that can be measured in single-top quark processes are scrutinized, such as $Wtb$ couplings and top quark couplings with neutral bosons, and the polarizations of both the $W$ boson and top quark. The effective field theory framework is emerging as a standard for interpreting property measurements. Perspectives for LHC Run 3 and the HL-LHC are discussed in the conclusions.",
