  "abstract": "Let $f \\colon \\mathcal{M} \\to \\mathbb{R}$ be a Lipschitz and geodesically convex function defined on a $d$-dimensional Riemannian manifold $\\mathcal{M}$. Does there exist a first-order deterministic algorithm which (a) uses at most $O(\\mathrm{poly}(d) \\log(ε^{-1}))$ subgradient queries to find a point with target accuracy $ε$, and (b) requires only $O(\\mathrm{poly}(d))$ arithmetic operations per query? In convex optimization, the classical ellipsoid method achieves this. After detailing related work, we provide an ellipsoid-like algorithm with query complexity $O(d^2 \\log^2(ε^{-1}))$ and per-query complexity $O(d^2)$ for the limited case where $\\mathcal{M}$ has constant curvature (hemisphere or hyperbolic space). We then detail possible approaches and corresponding obstacles for designing an ellipsoid-like method for general Riemannian manifolds.",
