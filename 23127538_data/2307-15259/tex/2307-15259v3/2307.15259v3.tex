\begin{abstract}
A power bounded operator $T$ is a Ritt operator in $L^p$ if $\sup_n n\lVert T^n-T^{n+1}\rVert<\infty$. When $T$ is a positive contraction and a Ritt operator in $L^p$, $1<p<\infty$, the square function \\
 $\Big( \sum_n n^{2m+1} |T^n(I-T)^{m+1}f|^2 \Big)^{1/2}$ is a bounded operator \cite{LeMX-Vq} in $L^p$. We show that if $T$ is a Ritt operator in $L^1$, then
\[Q_{\alpha,s,m}f=\Big( \sum_n n^{\alpha} |T^n(I-T)^mf|^s \Big)^{1/s}\] is bounded $L^1$ when $\alpha+1<sm$, and examine related questions regarding variational and oscillation norms.

\section{Introduction}

The purpose of this paper is to show that a certain "square" function is bounded in $L^1$ for a class of contractions operators.
Square functions and variational inequalities have been fruitful in martingale theory, harmonic analysis, in particular in Littlewood-Paley theory, and ergodic theory, to bound associated maximal functions, establish convergence of sequences of operators and control their speed of convergence. 

%History: Lepingle's variational ineq for martingales, 1976
% Bourgain polynomials and ergodic averages
% Bourgain [4] proved that if T is induced by a measure preserving transformation on (\omega, μ),
% then for any 2 < q < ∞,  \| (Mn(T)x)n≥0 \|_L2(vq ) ≤ Cq |x\|2, x ∈ L2().
%This inequality was then extended to Lp() for any 1 < p < ∞ by Jones, Kaufman, Rosen-blatt and Wierdl [16].

In the study of almost everywhere convergence of the powers $T^n f(x)$, Stein \cite{Stein} showed that for $T$ self adjoint with $\lVert T \rVert \le 1$, 
$Mf=\sup_{n\ge 1} |T^nf| $ and $Sf=\Big( \sum_{n\ge 1} n |T^{n+1}f-T^n f |^2 \Big)^{1/2}$ are bounded operators in $L^2$,
%\[ \Big\| \Big( \sum_{n\ge 1} n |T^{n+1}f-T^n f |^2 \Big)^{1/2}\Big\|_2 \lesssim \|f\|_2, \quad \| Mf\|_2 \lesssim \|f\|_2.\]
$\lVert Mf \rVert_2 \lesssim \lVert f \rVert_2$, and $\lVert Sf \rVert_2 \lesssim \lVert f \rVert_2.$
%(also Burkholder and Chow (6], Rota (12] studied a.e. convergence of the powers $T^n f(x)$ for symmetric operators in $L^p$) 

\begin{defn}\label{def:Stolz} A Stolz domain $\Sigma$ is the region within a unit disk characterized by $|1-z|\le c(1-|z|)$, for some constant $c$. 
$\Sigma_{\gamma}$ is the Stolz domain consiting of the interior of the convex hull of 1 and the disk $D(0,\sin \gamma)$.
% $B_a$ is the region for non-tangential convergence at 1, with aperture $a$.  
\end{defn}
For $T$ normal $L^2$ contraction  with $\sigma(T)$ inside a Stolz domain  $\Sigma$,
Below, Jones and Rosenblatt  \cite{BJR-power}    % note:   also in BJR-conv 1994 for convolutions
showed that both $Mf$ and $Sf$ are bounded operators in $L^2$; 
and if $T$ is an $L^1-L^{\infty}$ contraction, then $Mf$ is a bounded operator in $L^p$ for all $1<p<\infty$.

Around the time of the above results, the theory of functional calculus for sectorial operators was being develop, which provided control of square functions for a wider class of operators \cite{LeM-H,HH}.

\begin{defn} Let $Y$ be a Banach space. We say that  $T\in  \mathcal L(Y)$ is a Ritt operator if $T$ is power bounded and $\sup_n n\lVert T^n-T^{n+1}\rVert <\infty$.
\end{defn}

Ritt operators have been studied by many \cite{Ritt,Lyub,Nev,NZ,Bl}. 
The control of the resolvent of the operator is intricately linked to the containment of its spectrum within a Stolz domain.
Le Merdi \cite{LeM-H} exploited the connection between Ritt operators and sectorial operators to develop the $H^{\infty}$ functional calculus for Ritt operators, yielding new insights regarding the convergence of powers and maximal and square functions estimates \cite{LeM-H,LeMX-max,LeMX-Vq}. 

In particular,
LeMerdi and Xu \cite{LeMX-Vq} (Prop. 4.1, Thm. 4.4 \& Thm. 5.6) established the following implications for Ritt operators in $L^p$, $1<p<\infty$. 

\begin{thm} \label{thm:LeM} Let $(X,m)$ be a $\sigma$-finite measure space, $1<p<\infty$, and $T$ a positive contraction of $L^p(X,m)$. 
If $\sup_n n \lVert T^n-T^{n+1} \rVert<\infty$, then, for any fixed integer $m\ge 0$ and any real number $s>2$, 
\begin{itemize}
\item $\Big( \sum_n (n+1)^{2m+1} |T^n(I-T)^{m+1}f|^2 \Big)^{1/2}$, 
\item $\lVert \{T^nf\} \rVert_{v(s)}$, and more generally $\lVert \{n^m T^n(I-T)^mf\} \rVert_{v(s)}$, 
\item for any increasing sequence $\{n_k\}$, $\lVert \{T^nf\} \rVert_{o(2)}$, and more generally $\lVert \{n^m T^n(I-T)^mf\} \rVert_{o(2)}$, 
\end{itemize}
are bounded in $L^p$.
\end{thm} 


Cohen, Cuny and Lin  \cite{CCL}   provided equivalent conditions between the Ritt, spectral conditions and the square functions.
\begin{thm}\label{thm:CCL}
Let $(X,m)$ be a $\sigma$-finite measure space, $1 <p <\infty$ and $T$ a positive contraction on $L^p(X, m)$. Then the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item  $\sup_n n\lVert T^n-T^{n+1}\rVert <\infty$,
\item there exists a constant $C_p>0$ such that $\lVert (\sum_n n |T^nf-T^{n+1}f|^2)^{1/2}\rVert \le C_p \lVert f\rVert_p$,
\item there exists a closed Stolz region $\Sigma$ and a constant $K>0$ such that
$\lVert u(T)\rVert \le K \sup_{z\in \Sigma} u(z)$ for every rational function $u$ with poles outside $\Sigma$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}



Results in $L^1$ turned out to be more elusive even for the maximal function $Mf$. 
Let $(X,\beta,m)$ be a non-atomic, separable probability space and $\tau$ an invertible measure-preserving transformation on $(X,\beta,m)$. 
A probability measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb Z$ defines the contraction operator
$\tau_{\mu}f(x) = \sum_k \mu(k) f(\tau^k x)\label{eq:1}$, for $x\in X$, $f\in L^p(X)$, with $p\ge 1$. 
For such measures let $\hat{\mu}(t)=\sum_k \mu(k) e^{2\pi i kt}$ and $\tau_{\mu}$ is $\sigma(\mu)=\{\hat{\mu}(t): |t|\le 1/2\}$.  We say $\mu$ satisfies the bounded angular property iff $\sigma(\mu)\subset$ a Stoltz domain.

 Bellow and Calderon   \cite{BC}  showed that the maximal function \\
 $Mf=\sup_{n\ge 1} |\tau^n_{\mu}f|$ is weak (1,1) 
 for centered measures $\mu$ with finite second moment. Such measures have the bounded angular property.
 Losert \cite{Losert1,Losert2} constructed measures $\mu$ without the bounded angular property, for which pointwise convergence of $\tau^n_{\mu}$ failed.  Wedrychowicz  \cite{Chris} gave conditions for $Mf$ to be weak (1,1) for measures with $\sigma(\tau_{\mu})\subset$ a Stolz region but without a finite second moment.  

Regarding square functions in $L^1$, 
Jones, Ostrovskii and Rosenblat \cite{JOR} (Theorem 2.6) considered properties of square functions for differences of ergodic averages $A_nf(x) =\frac 1n \sum_{k=1}^n f(\tau^k x)$.
They showed that if $\{n_k\}$ is an increasing sequence of integers, then
$\Big( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \Big| A_{n_{k+1}}f-A_{n_k}f \Big|^2 \Big)^{1/2}$
is strong $(p,p)$ for $1<p\le 2$, and weak (1,1). It is also strong $(p,p)$ for $1<p<\infty$ if $\{n_k\}$ is lacunary.
And for sequences $n_k= p(k)$ for some
polynomial $p$ of degree $s > 0$, 
$\Big( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \sup_{n_k\le n \le n_{k+1}}  \Big| A_{n}f-A_{n_k}f \Big|^2 \Big)^{1/2}$
is strong $(p,p)$ for $1<p<\infty$ and weak (1,1). 

%To address a family of square functions for Ritt operators, we introduce some notation.

\begin{defn} %1.2
Let $S=\{\nu_n\}$ a sequence of finite signed measures in $\mathbb Z$. 
Let $\Lambda$ be the semigroup generated by the support of the measures, $\Lambda=<\cup_n \text{supp}(\nu_n)>$. 
We say that $T\in \mathcal L(Y)$ is $S$-bounded (or $\Lambda$-power bounded) if $\lVert T\rVert_S=\sup_{n\in \Lambda} \lVert T^n\rVert <\infty$.
\end{defn}

With this notation, power bounded is equivalent with $\mathbb Z^+$-power bounded.

Note that, if at least one of the supports of the measures $\nu_n \in S$ is not contained in the positive integers, we are implicitly requiring the operator to be invertible.

When the sequence $S$ is the collection of convolution measures of a single measure $\mu^n=\mu*\mu*\cdots*\mu$, we denote it by $S_{\mu}=\{\mu^n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$.

\begin{defn} %1.3
 Let $S=\{\nu\}$ a single finite signed measure on the integers, and 
$T$ an S-bounded linear operator. 
%If $supp(\mu)\not\subset \mathbb Z^+\cup\{0\}$,  assume $T$ is invertible and $\sup_{n\in \mathbb Z} \|T^n\|<\infty$.  
Define the operator induced by $\nu$ as
\[T_{\nu}f=\sum_k \nu(k) T^kf.\] 
\end{defn}
With the restrictions on the operator $T$, $T_{\nu}$ is well defined for any $f\in Y$. %$f\in L^1$. 
%In most of the paper, the Banach space is $L^1$ or $L^p$ depending on the context.


For $0<\alpha<1$, consider the series expansion for 
\[(1-x)^{\alpha}=1-\sum_{k\ge 1} g(\alpha,k) x^k, \quad |x|\le 1.
\] 
The coefficients satisfy $g(\alpha,k)=\frac{\alpha |\alpha-1| \ldots |\alpha-k+1|}{k!} \ge 0$ 
and it is easy to check that $\sum_k g(\alpha,k)=1$ (\cite{Dunn}, \cite{LinDer}). Let
$\nu_{\alpha}$ 
be the probability measure on $\mathbb Z^+$ define by them,
 \begin{equation}\nu_{\alpha}(k)= g(\alpha,k) \label{eqn:valpha}.\end{equation}


\begin{defn} %1.4
Let $T\in \mathcal L(Y)$ be power bounded.
Define $(I-T)^{\alpha}$ 
as \[(I-T)^{\alpha} = I - T_{\nu_{\alpha}}= I - \sum_{k\ge 1} g(\alpha,k) T^k.\]
\end{defn}

By separating the integer part from the fractional part, we can define  $(I-T)^m$ for any real $m>0$. 
In particular,
$T_{\mu}^n(I-T_{\mu})^m f = T_{\nu_{n,m}} f$
where $\nu_{n,m}$ is a signed measure on $\mathbb Z$ satisfying $\hat \nu_{n,m}(t) = \hat \mu^n(t) (1-\hat\mu(t))^m$.




\begin{defn} %1.5
For real numbers $s,r>0$, $\alpha>-1$, define the "generalized square function" (associated with the operator $T$) as:
\[Q_{\alpha,s,r}f =Q^{T}_{\alpha,s,r}f = \Big(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} n^{\alpha} |T^n(I-T)^r f|^{s} \Big)^{1/s}.\]
\end{defn}

%
\begin{thm} \label{thm:RittResult} Let $(X,m)$ be a $\sigma$-finite measure space and $T$ a Ritt operator in $L^1(X)$, $r>0$ and $s\ge 1$. Then 
\begin{enumerate}
\item $Q^T_{\alpha,s,r}f$ %=\Big( \sum_n n^{\alpha} |S^n(I-S)^mf|^s \Big)^{1/s}$ 
is bounded in $L^1$ for $sr>\alpha+1$;
\item $\sup_n n^{\alpha} |T^n (I- T)^{r} f|$ is bounded in $L^1$ for any  $\alpha<r$;
\item   both  $\lVert n^{\beta} T^n(I-T)^r f\rVert_{v(s)}$ and $\lVert n^{\beta} T^n(I-T)^r f\rVert_{o(s)}$ are bounded in $L^1$ if $\beta=0$ or $\beta>0$ and $s(r-\beta)>1$;
\item for any increasing sequence $\{n_k\}$ such that $ n_{k+1} -n_k \sim n_k^{\alpha}$ for some $\alpha\in(0,1)$, then 
\begin{enumerate}
\item %(i)
$\Big( \sum_k n_k^{\beta s} |T^{n_k}f-T^{n_{k+1}}f|^s \Big)^{1/s}$ and \\
$\Big( \sum_k n_k^{\beta s}  \max_{ n_k\le n<n_{k+1} } |T^n f-T^{n_k} f|^s \Big)^{1/s} $  
are bounded in $L^1$ for $s>(1-\alpha)/(1-\alpha-\beta)$; and\\
\item %(ii)  
$\Big( \sum_k n_k^{\beta s}  \lVert \{T^n f:n_k\le n<n_{k+1}\} \rVert_{v(s)}^s\Big)^{1/s}$
is bounded in $L^1$ for $s>1/(1-\alpha-\beta)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}
\end{thm}


This theorem is proven in stages by first considering results for the special case of $T_{\mu}$.



\begin{xrem}
Note that, by Theorem \ref{thm:CCL},  $Q_{1,2,1}f$  is bounded in $L^p$ for any $p>1$, but in $L^1$, 
$Q_{1,s,1}f$ is bounded for $s>2$. And in general, when $r=\alpha$, $Q_{r,s,r}f$ is bounded in $L^1$ for $s>1+1/r$.
Additionally, by Theorem \ref{thm:LeM}, $Q_{2r+1,2,(r+1)}f$ is bounded in $L^p$ for any $p>1$. In $L^1$,
 $Q_{2r+1,s,(r+1)}f$ bounded  for any $s>2$,  and $Q_{\alpha,2,(r+1)}f$ is bounded  for any $\alpha<2r+1$.
%When $r=1$,  $Q_{\alpha,s,1}f$ is bounded in $L^1$ for $s>1+\alpha$.
\end{xrem}

\begin{open} Is $Q_{\alpha,s,r}f$ weak (1,1)  for $sr=\alpha+1$? 
\end{open}

\section{The case of $T_{\mu}$}

 First we address sufficient conditions under which $T_{\mu}$ is a Ritt operator in $L^1$. 
 For $T$ an $L^1-L^{\infty}$ contraction, Blunke \cite{Bl} showed, with a clever interpolation argument, that if $T$ is Ritt in $L^2$, it is Ritt in $L^p$, $1<p<\infty$. The technique does not extend to $L^1$. But for the particular case of $T_{\mu}$,
 Dungey  \cite{Dunn} established $T_{\mu}$ is Ritt in $L^1$ for measures with a stronger property than bounded angular ratio.
 
 % 2.1
 \begin{thm} (Dungey \cite{Dunn}, Theorem 4.1) \label{thm:D}
Let $\mu$ be a probability measure on $\mathbb Z^+$ for which there exists $0<\alpha,c<1$ such that (i) $\mbox{Re} \, \hat\mu(t) \le 1-c |t|^{\alpha}$, and 
(ii)  $|\hat\mu'(t)|\lesssim |t|^{\alpha-1}$ for $0<|t|\le 1/2$.
If $T \in  \mathcal L(Y) $ is power bounded, then $T_{\mu}$ is Ritt in $L^1$.
\end{thm}
%Thm 1.5
 
 
 Inspired by \cite{Chris} and % Dungey (2011)  
 \cite{Dunn}, Cuny  \cite{Cuny-weak} considered more general spectral conditions for measures with support on $\mathbb Z$.

\begin{defn} % condition M
Let $\mu$ be a probability measure on $\mathbb Z$ with Fourier transform $\hat\mu(t)=\sum_k \mu(k) e^{-2\pi i kt}$ that
is twice continuously differentiable on $0<|t|<1$. When there exists a continuous function $h(t)$ on $|t|\le 1$ with $h(0)=0$, $h(-t)=h(t)$, continuously differentiable on $0<|t|<1$ satisfying the following conditions:
(i)  $|\hat\mu(t)|\le 1-c\, h(t)$,
(ii)  $|t \, \hat\mu'(t)|\le c\, h(t)$,
(iii)  $|\hat\mu'(t)|\le c\, h'(t)$, and
(iv)  $|t \, \hat\mu''(t)|\le c\, h'(t)$,
 we say $\mu$ satisfies condition M1. 
 
 If in addition $\hat\mu$ satisfies
(v) $h(t)\le c th'(t)$ for $0<t<1$, then we say $\mu$ satisfies condition M, or $\mu$ is an M-measure.
\end{defn}


Note that  M1 implies bounded angular ratio%imply the following. Since, if $|\hat\mu(t)|<1-ch(t)$,
\[ |1-\hat\mu(t)| \le | \int_0^t \hat\mu'(u) du | \le \int_0^{|t|} h'(u) du = h(t) \le \frac{1-|\hat\mu(t)|}{c}.\]
% This condition is called the bounded angular condition and imply 


%There are many examples of measure satisfying M. 
If $\mu$ is a centered measure with finite second moment, then it satisfies M with $h(t)=t^2$. 
The next example exhibits a non-centered measure  without finite first moment.
%2.3
\begin{example}   For fixed $0<\alpha<1$, let $\nu_{\alpha}$ be the probability measure on $\mathbb Z$ defined in (\ref{eqn:valpha}). 
Then $\hat\nu_{\alpha}(t) = 1-(1-e^{2\pi i t})^{\alpha}$. From \cite{Dunn}, $\nu_{\alpha}$ satisfies the conditions of Theorem \ref{thm:D} and hence $T_{\nu_{\alpha}} = I-(I-T)^{\alpha}$ is a Ritt operator in $L^1$. Additionally, $\nu_{\alpha}$ satisfies property M
 (\cite{Cuny-weak} (Proposition 3.3)). 
 
\end{example}

More examples of measures satisfying M can be found in \cite{Cuny-weak}. 






%%%%%%%%
%.    change to measure preserving case 
\begin{thm} \label{thm:weak} %  2.2     Prop 2.3 and 2.5,, 2.6
\cite{Cuny-weak} 
Let $(X,m)$ be a probability space, $\tau$ a measure preserving transformation on it.
Let $\mu$ be a probability measure on $\mathbb Z$ with property M1. Then 
$m(x\in X: \sup_n |\tau_{\mu}^nf(x)|>\lambda) \le \frac{C}{\lambda} \lVert f\rVert_1$
and $\tau_{\mu}$ is weak-$L^1$-Ritt:  \\
$ m(x\in X: \sup_n n^r |(\tau_{\mu}^n-\tau_{\mu}^{n+r})f(x)|>\lambda) \le \frac{C_r}{\lambda} \lVert f\rVert_1$
for any $f\in L^1(X)$.\\
If in addition, $\mu$ is an M-measure, then $\tau_{\mu}$ is Ritt in $L^1$.
%then  $\sup_n n\|\tau_{\mu}^n-\tau_{\mu}^{n+1}\|<\infty$. 
\end{thm} 

Cuny proved this result for the  shift operator in $l^1(\mathbb Z)$ but a transfer argument extends his result to operators defined by a measure presrving transformation on a probability space.


%Now we are ready for the main result.


%Thm 2.4 %% A numbered theorem with a fancy name:
\begin{mainthm}\label{thm:main}
Let $\mu$ be an M-probability measure on $\mathbb Z$ and $T\in \mathcal L(X)$ be $S_{\mu}$-bounded.
 If $r>0$, and  $sr>\alpha+1$,
then $Q_{\alpha,s,r}^{T_{\mu}}f$ is a bounded operator in $L^1$.
\end{mainthm} 




%Cor 2.5
\begin{cor} \label{cor:sup} Let $\mu$ be an M-probability measure on $\mathbb Z$ and $T\in \mathcal L(X)$ be $S_{\mu}$-bounded.
For $0\le \alpha<r$,
% \begin{enumerate} \item 
$\sup_n n^{\alpha} |T_{\mu}^n (I- T_{\mu})^{r}f|$ is bounded in $L^1$ and 
$\lim_{n\to \infty} n^{\alpha} |T_{\mu}^n (I- T_{\mu})^{r}f| = 0$ in norm and a.e..
%\item Let $1 <p <\infty$ and $T$ a positive contraction on $L^p(X)$.
%If $T$ a Ritt operator in $L^p$, then $\sup_n \frac{n^{m}}{\sqrt{\ln n}} |T^n (I- T)^{m}f|$ is bounded in $L^p$
%and $\lim_{n\to \infty} \frac{n^{m}}{\sqrt{\ln n}}  |T^n (I- T)^{m}f| = 0$ in norm and a.e.. % for any $\alpha<m$. 
%\end{enumerate}
\end{cor}



Theorem \ref{thm:LeM} showed that $\lVert n^{r} T_{\mu}^n(I-T_{\mu})^rf\rVert_{v(s)}$ and $\lVert n^{r} T_{\mu}^n(I-T_{\mu})^rf \rVert_{o(s)}$ 
are bounded in $L^p$, for $s>2$ and $p>1$ , even in the case $r=0$.
In $L^1$, we obtained the following variations and oscillations results.
%Prop 2.6
\begin{prop} \label{prop:genvar}
Let $\mu$ be an M-probability measure on $\mathbb Z$ and $T\in \mathcal L(X)$ be $S_{\mu}$-bounded.
Let $s\ge 1$, $r>0,$ and  $\beta\ge 0$  be fixed. If  $\beta=0$ or if $s(r-\beta)>1$, then both 
 $\lVert n^{\beta} T_{\mu}^n(I-T_{\mu})^r f \rVert_{v(s)}$ % \quad \mbox{ and } \quad
 and
 $\lVert n^{\beta} T_{\mu}^n(I-T_{\mu})^r f \rVert_{o(s)}$ are bounded in $L^1$.
\end{prop}

%Q 2
\begin{open} Are there values of $\beta>-1$ and $s>0$ for which
$\lVert n^{\beta} T_{\mu}^nf\rVert_{v(s)}$ and $\lVert n^{\beta} T_{\mu}^nf \rVert_{o(s)}$ are bounded in $L^1$.
\end{open}


%The result in Proposition \ref{prop:genvar} stays shy of the case $r=0$. 
The next result handles cases of 
differences along subsequences with increasing gaps.

%Prop 2.7
\begin{prop} \label{prop:longvar}
Let $\mu$ be an M-probability measure on $\mathbb Z$ and $T\in \mathcal L(X)$ be $S_{\mu}$-bounded.
Let  $\{n_k\}$ be an increasing sequence such that $ n_{k+1} -n_k \sim n_k^{\alpha}$ 
for some $0<\alpha<1$, and $0\le \beta<1-\alpha$. Then
\begin{enumerate}
\item 
$\Big( \sum_k n_k^{\beta s} |T_{\mu}^{n_k}f-T_{\mu}^{n_{k+1}}f|^s \Big)^{1/s}$
is bounded in $L^1$ for $s>(1-\alpha)/(1-\alpha-\beta)$.
 In particular,  $\Big( \sum_k  |T_{\mu}^{n_k}f-T_{\mu}^{n_{k+1}}f|^s \Big)^{1/s}$ is bounded in $L^1$ for $s>1$;
\item 
$\Big( \sum_k n_k^{\beta s}  \lVert \{T_{\mu}^n f:n_k\le n<n_{k+1}\} \rVert_{v(s)}^s\Big)^{1/s}$
is bounded in $L^1$ for $s>1/(1-\alpha-\beta)$; \\
and $\Big( \sum_k n_k^{\beta s}  \max_{ n_k\le n<n_{k+1} } |T_{\mu}^n f-T_{\mu}^{n_k} f|^s \Big)^{1/s} $  is
bounded in $L^1$ for $s>(1-\alpha)/(1-\alpha-\beta)$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prop}

\section{Auxiliary Lemma}
In these notes, $c$ and $C$ denote constants whose values may change from one instance to the next. We simplify $e(x)=e^{2\pi i x}$. And for  $0\le x,y$, we say $x \lesssim y$ if there exists a constant $c>0$ such that $x \le c y$.

\begin{lemma}\label{lem:basic} 
Let $S=\{\Delta_n\}$ be a sequences of (finite) signed measures on $\mathbb Z$ and $T\in \mathcal L(Y)$ an $S$-bounded operator.
Let
\begin{align*} 
A= & \int_{|t|<1/2} \frac 1{|t|} \Big( \sum_n |\hat \Delta_n(t)|^s \Big)^{1/s} dt,  \quad
B= & \int_{|t|<1/2} |t| \Big( \sum_n |\hat \Delta''_n(t)|^s \Big)^{1/s} dt, \\
 C=& \sum_{k\neq 0} \frac 1{|k|} \Big( \sum_n |\hat \Delta_n(1/|k|)|^s \Big)^{1/s},  \quad
 D=& \sum_{k\neq 0} \frac 1{|k|^2} \Big( \sum_n |\hat \Delta'_n(1/|k|)|^s \Big)^{1/s}, \\
 E= &\Big( \sum_n  \Big|   \Delta_n(0)   \Big|^{s} \Big)^{1/s}. \quad &
\end{align*}
If $A, B, C, D$ and $E$ are all finite,  then, for any $f\in X$,
\[ \Big\lVert  \Big( \sum_n |T_{\Delta_n}f|^s \Big)^{1/s} \Big\rVert \lesssim \lVert f\rVert.\]
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
%Let $\kappa = \sup_{n\in \mathbb Z} \|T^n\|$. 
Without loss of generality, we assume $\lVert T \rVert_S=1$.

\begin{align*}   \Big\lVert \Big( \sum_n |T_{\Delta_n}f|^s \Big)^{1/s} \Big\rVert
= & \Big\lVert \Big(\sum_n  \Big| \sum_k \Delta_n(k) T^kf\Big|^{s} \Big)^{1/s} \Big\rVert \\
\le &  c \Big\lVert   \Big( \sum_n  \Big|  \sum_{k\neq 0} \int_{|t|<1/2|k| } \hat \Delta_n(t) e(kt) dt  \,  T^kf \Big|^{s} \Big)^{1/s} \Big\rVert \\
 & + c \Big\lVert    \Big( \sum_n  \Big|  \sum_{k\neq 0}   \int_{1/2|k|<|t|<1/2} \hat \Delta_n(t) e(kt) dt  \,  T^kf \Big|^{s} \Big)^{1/s} \Big\rVert \\
& + c \Big\lVert    \Big( \sum_n  \Big|   \Delta_n(0)   \Big|^{s} \Big)^{1/s} |f| \Big\rVert \\
 =  & c (  \mbox{I} + \mbox{II}+  E \lVert f \rVert).
\end{align*}


For the first term we have,
\begin{align*}
  \mbox{I} 
=  & \Big\lVert   \Big( \sum_n  \Big|  \sum_{k\neq 0} \int_{|t|<1/2|k|} \hat \Delta_n(t) e(kt) dt  \,  T^kf\Big|^{s} \Big)^{1/s} \Big\rVert \\
\le & \lVert f\rVert \sum_{k\neq 0} \Big( \sum_n \Big|   \int_{|t|<1/ 2|k| } \hat \Delta_n(t) e(kt) dt   \Big|^{s} \Big)^{1/s}\\
\le &   \lVert f\rVert \int_{|t|<1/2} \frac1{|t|}  \Big( \sum_n  \Big| \hat \Delta_n(t) \Big|^s \Big)^{1/s}  \, dt
= A \lVert f\rVert.
  \end{align*}

For the second term we have,
\begin{align*}
\mbox{II} \le & \Big\lVert   \Big( \sum_n  \Big|  \sum_{k\neq 0}   \int_{1/2|k| <|t|<1/2} \hat \Delta_n(t) e(kt) dt  \,  T^kf \Big|^{s} \Big)^{1/s} \Big\rVert \\
\le & \Big\lVert  \sum_{k\neq 0}  \Big( \sum_n  \Big |  \int_{1/2|k|<|t|<1/2} \hat \Delta_n(t) e(kt) dt \Big |^s \Big)^{1/s} |T^kf | \Big\rVert\\
\le & \lVert f\rVert  \sum_{k\neq 0}  \Big( \sum_n  \Big |  \int_{1/2|k|<|t|<1/2} \hat \Delta_n(t) e(kt) dt \Big |^s \Big)^{1/s}.
\end{align*}

The integrand decomposes as
\begin{align*}
\Big| \int_{1/|k| <|t|<1/2} \hat \Delta_n(t) e(kt) dt \Big| \le & 
 \Big|\int_{1/|k| <|t|<1/2} \hat \Delta'_n(t) \frac{e(kt)}{2\pi k} dt \Big| \\
& + \Big|\frac{\hat \Delta_n(1/|k| ) e(k/|k| )}{2\pi k} - \frac{\hat \Delta_n(-1/|k| ) e(-k/|k| )}{2\pi k} \Big|\\  
\le &  \Big| \int_{1/|k| <|t|<1/2} \hat \Delta''_n(t) \frac{e(kt)}{4\pi^2 k^2} dt \Big| \\
 & + \Big| \frac{\hat \Delta_n(1/|k| ) e(k/|k| )}{2\pi k} - \frac{\hat \Delta_n(-1/|k| ) e(-k/|k| )}{2\pi k} \Big|\\  
 &  +  \Big| \frac{\hat \Delta'_n(1/|k| ) e(k/|k| )}{4\pi^2 k^2} - \frac{\hat \Delta'_n(-1/|k| ) e(-k/|k| )}{4\pi^2 k^2} \Big| 
 % = & \mbox{II}_1 + \mbox{II}_2 + \mbox{II}_3.
 \end{align*}


\begin{align*}
\sum_{k\neq 0}  & \Big( \sum_n  \Big |  \int_{1/2|k|<|t|<1/2} \hat \Delta''_n(t) \frac{e(kt)}{4\pi^2 k^2}  dt \Big |^s \Big)^{1/s} \\
\lesssim  & \sum_{k\neq 0} \frac 1{k^2}  \int_{1/2|k|<|t|<1/2} \Big( \sum_n  \Big | \hat \Delta''_n(t) \Big |^s \Big)^{1/s} \ dt  \\
\lesssim & \int_{0<|t|<1/2}  |t| \,  \Big( \sum_n  \Big | \hat \Delta''_n(t) \Big |^s \Big)^{1/s}\, dt  = B .
\end{align*}

Thus, $\mbox{II}\lesssim (B+C+D) \lVert f\rVert$.

\end{proof}

The proof of this lemma can be adapted for the following setting.


\begin{lemma}\label{lem:basic2} 
Let $\Delta_n$ and $T$ as in Lemma \ref{lem:basic}, $\{n_k\}$ an increasing sequence and $I_k=[n_k,n_{k+1})$.
Let
\begin{align*}
A= & \int_{|t|<1/2} \frac 1{|t|}        \Big( \sum_k n_k^{\beta} \max_{n\in I_k} |\hat \Delta_{n}(t)|^s \Big)^{1/s} dt,  \quad
B= & \int_{|t|<1/2} |t|     \Big( \sum_k n_k^{\beta} \max_{n\in I_k} |\hat \Delta''_{n}(t)|^s \Big)^{1/s} dt, \\
C=&\sum_{l\neq 0} \frac 1{|l|}       \Big( \sum_k n_k^{\beta} \max_{n\in I_k} |\hat \Delta_{n}(1/|l|)|^s \Big)^{1/s},  \quad
D= &\sum_{l\neq 0} \frac 1{|l|^2}       \Big( \sum_k n_k^{\beta} \max_{n\in I_k} |\hat \Delta'_{n}(1/|l|)|^s \Big)^{1/s}, \\
 E= &     \Big( \sum_k n_k^{\beta} \max_{n\in I_k}  \Big|   \Delta_{n}(0)   \Big|^{s} \Big)^{1/s}. &
\end{align*}
If $A, B, C, D, E$ are all finite, then, for any $f\in X$,
\[ \Big\lVert    \Big( \sum_k n_k^{\beta} \max_{n\in I_k} |T_{\Delta_{n}}f|^s \Big)^{1/s} \Big\rVert \lesssim  \lVert f \rVert.\]
\end{lemma}

\section{Proofs of Results}

%2.4
\noindent {\textit Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:main}:}\\
Let $\Delta_n$ be
the measure on the integers defined by $\hat\Delta_n=n^{\alpha/s} \hat\mu^n (1-\hat\mu)^r$, that is, 
$T_{\Delta_n}=n^{\alpha/s} T_{\mu}^n (I-T_{\mu})^r$. Using Lemma \ref{lem:basic} with $\Delta_n$, it suffices to show that the corresponding terms defined in the lemma, A, B, C, D and E, are bounded.
The case for $\alpha<-1$ is immediate. Assume $\alpha\ge -1$. 

For $\alpha>-1$, dominating the sum by an integral and using condition (i) of property M, we obtain
\[\sum_n n^{\alpha}  |\hat\mu(t)|^{ns} \le \sum_n n^{\alpha}  (1-c \, h(t))^{ns}    \lesssim   \frac 1{h(t)^{\alpha+1}}.\]%\frac1{(1-|\hat\mu(t)|)^{\alpha+1}} ,\]
For $\alpha=-1$, 
\[\sum_n \frac 1n  |\hat\mu(t)|^{ns} \le \sum_n \frac 1n  (1-ch(t))^{ns}= | \ln(1-(1-ch(t))^s) | % \lesssim \frac 1{(1-|\hat\mu(t)|)^{\gamma}}
 \lesssim \frac 1{h(t)^{\gamma}}
\mbox{ for any }\gamma>0.\] 


Condition (iii) of property M also implies
$|1-\hat\mu(t)|  \le c \int_0^{|t|} h(s)' ds = c h(t)$. % \le c (1-|\hat\mu(t)|).\]

For term A, we estimate
\begin{align*}
A=\int_{|t|<1/2} \frac1{|t|} &  \Big( \sum_n  \Big| \hat\Delta_n(t) \Big|^s \Big)^{1/s}  \\
= &    \int_{|t|<1/2}  \Big( \sum_n n^{\alpha} | \hat\mu(t)|^{ns} \Big)^{1/s} \frac{|1-\hat\mu(t)|^{r}}{|t|}  \\
\lesssim  & \begin{cases} \int_{0<t<1/2} h(t)^{r-(\alpha+1)/s-1}  \, h'(t) \, dt & \mbox{ for } \alpha>-1 \\
 \int_{0<t<1/2} h(t)^{r-\gamma/s-1}  \, h'(t) \, dt & \mbox{ for } \alpha=-1.
 \end{cases}
  \end{align*}
When $\alpha>-1$, the integral is finite for $sr >\alpha+1$, and when $\alpha=-1$, the integral is finite for $r>0$ 
since we can choose $\gamma$ arbitrarily small, say $\gamma=sr/2$.

% III
Similarly for E, with $sr >\alpha+1$ for $\alpha>-1$ and $0<\gamma<sr /2$ for $\alpha=-1$,
\begin{align*}
E= \Big( \sum_n  \Big|   \Delta_n(0)   \Big|^{s} \Big)^{1/s} \le &
\Big( \sum_n n^{\alpha}    \int_{|t|<1/2} |\hat\mu(t)|^{ns} |1-\hat\mu(t)|^{sr}\, dt \Big)^{1/s} \\
\lesssim  &\begin{cases} \Big(  \int_{|t|<1/2}  h(t)^{ (sr-(\alpha+1))}\, dt \Big)^{1/s} <\infty, & \mbox{ for } \alpha>-1 \\
 \Big(  \int_{|t|<1/2}  h(t)^{ (sr-\gamma)} \, dt \Big)^{1/s} <\infty, & \mbox{ for } \alpha=-1. 
  \end{cases}
\end{align*}


With $B_n=T^n (I-T)^r$,
\[
|\hat B'_n(t)| = | n \hat\mu^{n-1}(t) (\hat \mu'(t)) (1-\hat\mu(t))^r 
     - \hat\mu^{n}(t) \hat \mu'(t)(1-\hat\mu(t))^{r-1}|, \]
and 
\begin{align*}
|\hat B''_n(t)| = &| n(n-1) \hat\mu^{n-2}(t) (\hat \mu'(t))^2 (1-\hat\mu(t))^r 
     +n \hat\mu^{n-1}(t) \hat \mu''(t)(1-\hat\mu(t))^r \\
& - 2n r \hat\mu^{n-1}(t) (\hat \mu'(t))^2 (1-\hat\mu(t))^{r-1}  \\
&+ r (r-1) \hat\mu^{n}(t) (1-\hat\mu(t))^{r-2}  (\hat\mu'(t))^2\\
& - r \hat\mu^{n}(t) (1-\hat\mu(t))^{r-1}  \hat \mu''(t)| \\
\lesssim & n^2 |\hat\mu^{n-2}(t)| \frac{h'(t)}{|t|} h^{r+1}(t) + 
n |\hat\mu^{n-1}(t)| \frac{h'(t)}{|t|} h^{r}(t) \\
& + |\hat\mu^{n}(t)| \frac{h'(t)}{|t|} h^{r-1}(t).
\end{align*}
Thus, for $\alpha>-1$,
\[
\Big(\sum_n   |\hat \Delta''_n (t)|^s=  \sum_n n^{\alpha}  |\hat B''_n (t)|^s\Big)^{1/s}  
\lesssim    
h(t)^{(r-1)-(\alpha+1)/s} \frac{|h'(t)|}{|t|}.\]
% II_1
Since $(1+\alpha)< s r $,
\begin{align*}
B=   \int_{|t|<1/2} |t| \, \Big( \sum_n   |\hat\Delta''_n(t)|^s  \Big)^{1/s} dt   
 \lesssim &  \int_{0<t<1/2}   h(t)^{(r-1)-(\alpha+1)/s } \, h'(t) \, dt <\infty.   \label{eq:II1} 
\end{align*}

When $\alpha=-1$, choosing $0<\gamma<r$, the estimate is
\[   \int_{|t|<1/2} |t| \, \Big( \sum_n   |\hat\Delta''_n(t)|^s  \Big)^{1/s} dt   
 \lesssim   \int_{0<t<1/2}   h(t)^{r-\gamma-1 } \, h'(t) \, dt <\infty.  \]


For the remaining terms, we address the case $\alpha>-1$ since the estimates for the case $\alpha=-1$ follow similar arguments.
% II_2
For $(1+\alpha)< s r $, we have
\begin{align*}
 C= \sum_{k\neq 0} \frac 1{|k|} &
\Big(    \sum_n   |\hat\Delta_n(1/|k| )|^s  \Big)^{1/s}  \\
\lesssim   & \sum_{k\neq 0} \frac 1{|k|} \Big(    \sum_n n^{\alpha} |\hat\mu(1/|k|)|^{ns} 
|1-\hat\mu(1/|k|)|^{s r}  \Big)^{1/s} \nonumber  \\
\lesssim & \sum_{k> 0} \frac 1k  h(1/k)^{r - (\alpha+1)/s}
\le c+ \int_0^{1/2} \frac{h(t)^{r - (\alpha+1)/s}}t \, dt <\infty.
\label{eq:II2}
\end{align*}
Since
\[ \Big( \sum_n  |\hat\Delta'_n(1/|k| )|^s\Big)^{1/s} = \Big( \sum_n n^{\alpha}  |\hat B'_n(1/|k| )|^s\Big)^{1/s}
 \lesssim  h(1/k)^{r-(\alpha+1)/s} h'(1/k), \]
 it follows 
\begin{align*}
D = & \sum_{k\neq 0} \frac 1{|k|^2}
\Big(    \sum_n   |\hat\Delta'_n(1/|k| )|^s  \Big)^{1/s} \nonumber \\
 & 
  \lesssim     \sum_{k\neq 0} \frac 1{|k|^2}   h(1/k)^{r - (\alpha+1)/s} h'(1/k) <\infty.   \label{eq:II3}

  \noindent {\textit Proof of Corollay \ref{cor:sup}:}\\
An application of Abel's summation yields
\begin{align*}
n^{\alpha } |T_{\mu}^{n-1}(I-T_{\mu})^{r} f| \le & \sum_{k=0}^{n-1} ((k+1)^{\alpha }-k^{\alpha } )|T_{\mu}^k(I - T_{\mu})^{r} f| \\
& + \sum_{k=1}^n k^{\alpha } |T_{\mu}^{k-1}(1-T_{\mu})^{r+1}f|\\

& + \sum_{k=1}^n k^{\alpha } |T_{\mu}^{k-1}(1-T_{\mu})^{r+1}f|\\
\lesssim &  \ Q_{\alpha -1,1,r}f + Q_{\alpha ,1,r+1}f.
\end{align*}
By Theorem \ref{thm:main},
 both generalized square functions on the right are bounded in $L^1$ for $\alpha< r$ and $r>0$. Therefore 
$\sup_n n^{\alpha } |T_{\mu}^n(I - T_{\mu})^{r})f|$ is also bounded in $L^1$.

%Variation. 2.6
\noindent {\textit Proof of Proposition \ref{prop:genvar}:}\\

Let $\Delta_{n,r}f=T_{\mu}^n(I-T_{\mu})^r f$, and 
let $\{n_k\}$ any increasing sequence. 
%\begin{align*}
\[D_{k,\beta}=  n_k^{\beta} \Delta_{n_k,r} - n_{k+1}^{\beta} \Delta_{n_{k+1},r} 
=  n_k^{\beta} \sum_{u=n_k}^{n_{k+1}-1} \Delta_{u,r+1} - (n_{k+1}^{\beta}-n_k^{\beta} ) \Delta_{n_{k+1},r}.
%\end{align*}
\]
%Choose $1>\alpha>1/s'$,  %$1-\alpha<1/s$
\begin{align*}
\Big( \sum_k |D_{k,\beta}f|^s \Big)^{1/s}
\lesssim &  \sum_k  \sum_{u=n_k}^{n_{k+1}-1}  u^{\beta } |\Delta_{u,r+1}f|  
+ \Big( \sum_k n_k^{s\beta}  |\Delta_{n_{k},r}f|^s  \Big)^{1/s}.
\end{align*}
Thus, 
\[ \lVert n^{\beta}\Delta_{n,r}f \rVert_{v(s)}  \lesssim Q_{\beta ,1,r+1}f + Q_{\beta s,s,r}f,\]
which, by Theorem \ref{thm:main}, are bounded in $L^1$ for $s(r-\beta)>1$.


For $n_k\le n \le n_{k+1}$
\[ \max_{n_k\le n \le n_{k+1}}
\Big| n^{\beta} \Delta_{n,r} - n_{k}^{\beta} \Delta_{n_{k},r}f \Big|^s \le 
 \sum_{u=n_k}^{n_{k+1}-1} u^{\beta } |\Delta_{u,r+1}f| 
+  \sum_{u=n_k+1}^{n_{k+1}} n^{s\beta}  |\Delta_{n,r}f|^s.
\]
Thus, 
\[ \lVert n^{\beta}\Delta_{n,r}f \rVert_{o(s)}  \lesssim Q_{\beta ,1,r+1}f + Q_{\beta s,s,r}f\]
is bounded in $L^1$ for $s(r-\beta)>1$.

When $\beta=0$,
\[ \lVert \Delta_{n,r}f \rVert_{v(s)}  \lesssim Q_{0,1,r+1}f \quad
\mbox{ and }\quad
 \lVert \Delta_{n,r}f \rVert_{o(s)}  \lesssim Q_{0,1,r+1}f,\]
are bounded in $L^1$ for $r> 0$.

%Variation on special sequence: 
Assume $\mu$ satisfy condition M and 
apply Lemma \ref{lem:basic} with $\Delta_k = n_k^{\beta } (T_{\mu}^{n_k} f - T_{\mu}^{n_{k+1}})$.

For $\gamma>\alpha$,
 \[\sum_k n_k^{s\gamma} (n_{k+1}-n_k) |\hat\mu(t)|^{n_k s}\lesssim \frac1{h(t)^{s\gamma+1}} .\]

for $\alpha+\beta+(1-\alpha)/s<1, s>1$. %, that is $\beta s'<1-\alpha$.

Similarly, 
\begin{align*}

Now, let $I_k=[n_k,n_{k+1})$. 
\begin{align*}
\sum_k  n_k^{\beta s}  \lVert\{T_{\mu}^n f-T_{\mu}^{n_k}f: &n\in I_k \} \rVert_{v(s)}^s     \le   c \sum_k  n_k^{\beta s} \sum_{n\in I_k} |T_{\mu}^n f-T_{\mu}^{n_k}f|^s \\
\le  &c \sum_k n_k^{\beta s}  (n_{k+1}-n_k) \max_{n\in I_k} |T_{\mu}^n f-T_{\mu}^{n_k}f|^s .  
 \end{align*}
 Using Lemma \ref{lem:basic2} and arguments similar to the above, 
 \[\Big(\sum_k  n_k^{\beta s}  \lVert \{T_{\mu}^n f-T_{\mu}^{n_k}f:n\in I_k \} \rVert_{v(s)}^s \Big)^{1/s}\]
is bounded in $L^1$ for $1<s(1-\alpha-\beta)$, and \[\Big(\sum_k n_k^{\beta s} \max_{n\in I_k} |T_{\mu}^n f-T_{\mu}^{n_k}f|^s \Big)^{1/s}\]
is bounded in $L^1$ for $1-\alpha<s(1-\alpha-\beta)$.

~\hfill$\square$


\noindent {\textit Proof of Theorem \ref{thm:RittResult}.}
%We conclude noticing that any Ritt operator in $L^1$ inherits the same properties as those obtained for $T_{\mu}$. 
By Theorem 1.3. in \cite{Dunn}, there exists  a power bounded %Kreiss 
operator $R$ and $\gamma\in (0,1)$ 
such that 
$T=I-(I-R)^{\gamma} = R_{\nu_{\gamma}}$, where $\nu_{\gamma}$ is the probability measure on $\mathbb Z$ defined in (\ref{eqn:valpha}).  
Therefore Theorem \ref{thm:main}, Corollary \ref{cor:sup}, Propositions \ref{prop:genvar} and \ref{prop:longvar} apply to $T$.
\hfill$\square$
