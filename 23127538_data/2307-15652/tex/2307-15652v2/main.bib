abstract={Large-gap quantum spin Hall insulators are promising materials for room-temperature applications based on Dirac fermions. Key to engineer the topologically non-trivial band ordering and sizable band gaps is strong spin-orbit interaction. Following Kane and Mele's original suggestion, one approach is to synthesize monolayers of heavy atoms with honeycomb coordination accommodated on templates with hexagonal symmetry. Yet, in the majority of cases, this recipe leads to triangular lattices, typically hosting metals or trivial insulators. Here, we conceive and realize ``indenene'', a triangular monolayer of indium on SiC exhibiting non-trivial valley physics driven by local spin-orbit coupling, which prevails over inversion-symmetry breaking terms. By means of tunneling microscopy of the 2D bulk we identify the quantum spin Hall phase of this triangular lattice and unveil how a hidden honeycomb connectivity emerges from interference patterns in Bloch px{\thinspace}{\textpm}{\thinspace}ipy-derived wave functions.},

pages={390-394},
abstract={The electric-field-induced quantum phase transition from topological to conventional insulator has been proposed as the basis of a topological field effect transistor1--4. In this scheme, `on' is the ballistic flow of charge and spin along dissipationless edges of a two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulator5--9, and `off' is produced by applying an electric field that converts the exotic insulator to a conventional insulator with no conductive channels. Such a topological transistor is promising for low-energy logic circuits4, which would necessitate electric-field-switched materials with conventional and topological bandgaps much greater than the thermal energy at room temperature, substantially greater than proposed so far6--8. Topological Dirac semimetals are promising systems in which to look for topological field-effect switching, as they lie at the boundary between conventional and topological phases3,10--16. Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy and angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy to show that mono- and bilayer films of the topological Dirac semimetal3,17 Na3Bi are two-dimensional topological insulators with bulk bandgaps greater than 300 millielectronvolts owing to quantum confinement in the absence of electric field. On application of electric field by doping with potassium or by close approach of the scanning tunnelling microscope tip, the Stark effect completely closes the bandgap and re-opens it as a conventional gap of 90 millielectronvolts. The large bandgaps in both the conventional and quantum spin Hall phases, much greater than the thermal energy at room temperature (25 millielectronvolts), suggest that ultrathin Na3Bi is suitable for room-temperature topological transistor operation.},

The first-principles band structures between the I3 and SbF6 salts are apparently different. We construct a tight-binding model for each material which accurately reproduces the first-principles band structure. The obtained transfer energies give the differences as follows: (i) larger dimerization in the I3 salt than the SbF6 salt, and (ii) different signs and directions of the interstacking transfer energies. To decompose the origin of the difference into the dimerization and the interstacking transfer energies, we adopt a simplified model by eliminating the dimerization effect and focus only on the difference caused by the interstacking transfer energies. From the analysis using the simplified model, we find that the difference of the band structure comes mainly from the strength of the dimerization. To compare the strength of the electron correlation having roots in the band structure, we calculate the physical properties originating from the effect of the electron correlation such as the spin susceptibility applying the two-particle self-consistent method. We find that the maximum value of the spin susceptibility for the I3 salt is larger than that of the SbF6 salt. Hypothetically decreasing the dimerization within the model of the I3 salt, the spin susceptibility takes almost the same value as that of the SbF6 salt for the same magnitude of the dimerization. We expect that the different ground state between the I3 and SbF6 salt mainly comes from the strength of the dimerization which is apparently masked in the band calculation along a particular k path.}, number={15}, journal={Physical Review B}, publisher={American Physical Society}, author={Aizawa, Hirohito and Kuroki, Kazuhiko and Yamada, Jun-ichi}, year={2015}, month={Oct}, pages={155108} }

By contrast, recent experiments reveal that Tc in the electron-doped systems monotonically increases as the doping is reduced, at least up to a very small doping rate. Here we show that this asymmetry is reproduced by performing a two-particle self-consistent analysis for the three-band model of the CuO2 plane. This is explained as a combined effect of the intrinsic electron-hole asymmetry in systems comprising Cu3d and O2p orbitals and the band-filling-dependent vertex correction.}, number={14}, journal={Physical Review B}, publisher={American Physical Society}, author={Ogura, Daisuke and Kuroki, Kazuhiko}, year={2015}, month={Oct}, pages={144511} }

Such an extension allows for the inclusion of molecule degrees of freedom in the description of these systems. We present both benchmarking results for the half-filled dimer model as well as detailed investigations for the 3/4-filled molecule model. Remarkably, we find in the latter model that the phase boundary between the two most competing gap symmetries discussed in the context of these materials—dxy and the recently proposed eight-node s+dx2−y2 gap symmetry—is located within the regime of realistic model parameters and is especially sensitive to the degree of in-plane anisotropy in the materials as well as to the value of the on-site Hubbard repulsion. We show that these results provide a more complete and accurate description of the superconducting properties of κ−(BEDT−TTF)2X than previous random phase approximation (RPA) calculations and, in particular, we discuss predicted critical temperatures in comparison to experiments. Finally, our findings suggest that it may be even easier to experimentally switch between the two pairing symmetries as previously anticipated by invoking pressure, chemical doping, or disorder effects.}, number={1}, journal={Physical Review B}, publisher={American Physical Society}, author={Zantout, Karim and Altmeyer, Michaela and Backes, Steffen and Valentí, Roser}, year={2018}, month={Jan}, pages={014530} }

Using the two-dimensional half-filled Hubbard model at weak coupling as a testing ground, we perform a comparative study of a comprehensive set of state-of-the-art quantum many-body methods. Upon cooling into its insulating antiferromagnetic ground state, the model hosts a rich sequence of distinct physical regimes with crossovers between a high-temperature incoherent regime, an intermediate-temperature metallic regime, and a low-temperature insulating regime with a pseudogap created by antiferromagnetic fluctuations. We assess the ability of each method to properly address these physical regimes and crossovers through the computation of several observables probing both quasiparticle properties and magnetic correlations, with two numerically exact methods (diagrammatic and determinantal quantum Monte Carlo methods) serving as a benchmark. By combining computational results and analytical insights, we elucidate the nature and role of spin fluctuations in each of these regimes. Based on this analysis, we explain how quasiparticles can coexist with increasingly long-range antiferromagnetic correlations and why dynamical mean-field theory is found to provide a remarkably accurate approximation of local quantities in the metallic regime. We also critically discuss whether imaginary-time methods are able to capture the non-Fermi-liquid singularities of this fully nested system.}, number={1}, journal={Physical Review X}, publisher={American Physical Society}, author={Schäfer, Thomas and Wentzell, Nils and Šimkovic, Fedor and He, Yuan-Yao and Hille, Cornelia and Klett, Marcel and Eckhardt, Christian J. and Arzhang, Behnam and Harkov, Viktor and Le Régent, François-Marie and Kirsch, Alfred and Wang, Yan and Kim, Aaram J. and Kozik, Evgeny and Stepanov, Evgeny A. and Kauch, Anna and Andergassen, Sabine and Hansmann, Philipp and Rohe, Daniel and Vilk, Yuri M. and LeBlanc, James P.

abstract = {Taking practical advantage of the topologically protected conducting edge states of topological insulators (TIs) has proven difficult. Semiconductor systems that have been identified as two-dimensional TIs must be cooled down to near liquid helium temperatures to bring out their topological character. Wu et al. fabricated a heterostructure consisting of a monolayer of WTe2 placed between two layers of hexagonal boron nitride and found that its topological properties persisted up to a relatively high temperature of 100 K. Engineering this so-called quantum spin Hall effect in a van der Waals heterostructure makes it possible to apply many established experimental tools and functionalities. Science, this issue p. 76 Transport measurements show that the monolayer of WTe2 has helical edge modes at elevated temperatures. A variety of monolayer crystals have been proposed to be two-dimensional topological insulators exhibiting the quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE), possibly even at high temperatures. Here we report the observation of the QSHE in monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) at temperatures up to 100 kelvin. In the short-edge limit, the monolayer exhibits the hallmark transport conductance, ~e2/h per edge, where e is the electron charge and h is Planck’s constant. Moreover, a magnetic field suppresses the conductance, and the observed Zeeman-type gap indicates the existence of a Kramers degenerate point and the importance of time-reversal symmetry for protection from elastic backscattering. Our results establish the QSHE at temperatures much higher than in semiconductor heterostructures and allow for exploring topological phases in atomically thin crystals.}}

abstract = {Topological insulators are a recently described state of matter in which the bulk material is an insulator but with a metallic surface state that is protected by the topology of the Fermi surface. Roth et al. (p. 294; see the Perspective by Büttiker) now show that the current flow on the surface takes place in edge states around the boundary of the sample. These are similar to the current transport in high-quality two-dimensional electron gases in high magnetic field, which confirms theoretical work on these materials. A topological insulator exhibits current flow in edge states around the sample without the need for magnetic fields. Nonlocal transport through edge channels holds great promise for low-power information processing. However, edge channels have so far only been demonstrated to occur in the quantum Hall regime, at high magnetic fields. We found that mercury telluride quantum wells in the quantum spin Hall regime exhibit nonlocal edge channel transport at zero external magnetic field. The data confirm that the quantum transport through the (helical) edge channels is dissipationless and that the contacts lead to equilibration between the counterpropagating spin states at the edge. The experimental data agree quantitatively with the theory of the quantum spin Hall effect. The edge channel transport paves the way for a new generation of spintronic devices for low-power information processing.}}

abstract = {The discovery of the quantum spin Hall effect and topological insulators more than a decade ago has revolutionized modern condensed matter physics. Today, the field of topological states of matter is one of the most active and fruitful research areas for both experimentalists and theorists. The physics of topological insulators is typically well described by band theory and systems of non-interacting fermions. In contrast, several of the most fascinating effects in condensed matter physics merely exist due to electron–electron interactions, examples include unconventional superconductivity, the Kondo effect, and the Mott–Hubbard transition.

The aim of this review article is to give an overview of the manifold directions which emerge when topological bandstructures and correlation physics interfere and compete. These include the study of the stability of topological bandstructures and correlated topological insulators. Interaction-induced topological phases such as the topological Kondo insulator provide another exciting topic. More exotic states of matter such as topological Mott insulator and fractional Chern insulators only exist due to the interplay of topology and strong interactions and do not have any bandstructure analogue. Eventually the relation between topological bandstructures and frustrated quantum magnetism in certain transition metal oxides is emphasized.}

abstract={A spin liquid is a novel quantum state of matter with no conventional order parameter where a finite charge gap exists even though the band theory would predict metallic behavior. Finding a stable spin liquid in two or higher spatial dimensions is one of the most challenging and debated issues in condensed matter physics. Very recently, it has been reported that a model of graphene, i.e., the Hubbard model on the honeycomb lattice, can show a spin liquid ground state in a wide region of the phase diagram, between a semi-metal (SM) and an antiferromagnetic insulator (AFMI). Here, by performing numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we extend the previous study to much larger clusters (containing up to 2592 sites) and find, if any, a very weak evidence of this spin liquid region. Instead, our calculations strongly indicate a direct and continuous quantum phase transition between SM and AFMI.},

    abstract = { Topological insulators present a bulk gap, but allow for dissipationless spin transport along the edges. These exotic states are characterized by the Z2 topological invariant and are protected by time-reversal symmetry. The Kane–Mele model is one model to realize this topological class in two dimensions, also called the quantum spin Hall state. In this brief review article, we provide a pedagogical introduction to the influence of correlation effects in the quantum spin Hall states, with special focus on the half-filled Kane–Mele–Hubbard model, solved by means of unbiased determinant quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations. We explain the idea of identifying the topological insulator via π-flux insertion, the Z2 invariant and the associated behavior of the zero-frequency Green's function, as well as the spin Chern number in parameter-driven topological phase transitions. The examples considered are two descendants of the Kane–Mele–Hubbard model, the generalized and dimerized Kane–Mele–Hubbard model. From the Z2 index, spin Chern numbers and the Green's function behavior, one can observe that correlation effects induce shifts of the topological phase boundaries. Although the implementation of these topological quantities has been successfully employed in QMC simulations to describe the topological phase transition, we also point out their limitations as well as suggest possible future directions in using numerical methods to characterize topological properties of strongly correlated condensed matter systems. }

abstract = {Recent theory predicted that the quantum spin Hall effect, a fundamentally new quantum state of matter that exists at zero external magnetic field, may be realized in HgTe/(Hg,Cd)Te quantum wells. We fabricated such sample structures with low density and high mobility in which we could tune, through an external gate voltage, the carrier conduction from n-type to p-type, passing through an insulating regime. For thin quantum wells with well width d \&lt; 6.3 nanometers, the insulating regime showed the conventional behavior of vanishingly small conductance at low temperature. However, for thicker quantum wells (d \&gt; 6.3 nanometers), the nominally insulating regime showed a plateau of residual conductance close to 2e2/h, where e is the electron charge and h is Planck's constant. The residual conductance was independent of the sample width, indicating that it is caused by edge states. Furthermore, the residual conductance was destroyed by a small external magnetic field. The quantum phase transition at the critical thickness, d = 6.3 nanometers, was also independently determined from the magnetic field–induced insulator-to-metal transition. These observations provide experimental evidence of the quantum spin Hall effect.}}

The effect is the photonic version of the spin Hall effect in electronic systems, indicating the universality of the effect for particles of different nature. Treating the effect as a weak measurement of the spin projection of the photons, we used a preselection and postselection technique on the spin state to enhance the original displacement by nearly four orders of magnitude, attaining sensitivity to displacements of ∼1 angstrom. The spin Hall effect can be used for manipulating photonic angular momentum states, and the measurement technique holds promise for precision metrology.}}

abstract={Spin--orbit coupling (SOC) is the key to realizing time-reversal-invariant topological phases of matter1,2. SOC was predicted by Kane and Mele3 to stabilize a quantum spin Hall insulator; however, the weak intrinsic SOC in monolayer graphene4--7 has precluded experimental observation in this material. Here we exploit a layer-selective proximity effect---achieved via a van der Waals contact with a semiconducting transition-metal dichalcogenide8--21---to engineer Kane--Mele SOC in ultra clean bilayer graphene. Using high-resolution capacitance measurements to probe the bulk electronic compressibility, we find that SOC leads to the formation of a distinct, incompressible, gapped phase at charge neutrality. The experimental data agree quantitatively with a simple theoretical model in which the new phase results from SOC-driven band inversion. In contrast to Kane--Mele SOC in monolayer graphene, the inverted phase is not expected to be a time-reversal-invariant topological insulator, despite being separated from conventional band insulators by electric-field-tuned phase transitions where crystal symmetry mandates that the bulk gap must close22. Our electrical transport measurements reveal that the inverted phase has a conductivity of approximately e2/h (where e is the electron charge and h Planck's constant), which is suppressed by exceptionally small in-plane magnetic fields. The high conductivity and anomalous magnetoresistance are consistent with theoretical models that predict helical edge states within the inverted phase that are protected from backscattering by an emergent spin symmetry that remains robust even for large Rashba SOC. Our results pave the way for proximity engineering of strong topological insulators as well as correlated quantum phases in the strong spin--orbit regime in graphene heterostructures.},

abstract = {One of the primary challenges in the field of spin-electronics, which exploits the electron's spin rather than its charge, is to create strong currents of electrons with polarized spins. One way to do this is to use a ferromagnet as a polarizer, a principle used in magnetic tunnel junctions; however, these devices suffer from reliability problems. An alternative is the spin Hall effect, where running a charge current through a material generates a spin current in the transverse direction, but the efficiency of this process tends to be small. Liu et al. (p. 555) now show that the spin Hall effect in Tantalum in its high-resistance β phase generates spin currents strong enough to induce switching of the magnetization of an adjacent ferromagnet; at the same time, Ta does not cause energy dissipation in the ferromagnet. These properties allowed efficient and reliable operation of a prototype three-terminal device. Tantalum is found to generate strong spin currents that can induce switching of ferromagnets efficiently and reliably. Spin currents can apply useful torques in spintronic devices. The spin Hall effect has been proposed as a source of spin current, but its modest strength has limited its usefulness. We report a giant spin Hall effect (SHE) in β-tantalum that generates spin currents intense enough to induce efficient spin-torque switching of ferromagnets at room temperature. We quantify this SHE by three independent methods and demonstrate spin-torque switching of both out-of-plane and in-plane magnetized layers. We furthermore implement a three-terminal device that uses current passing through a tantalum-ferromagnet bilayer to switch a nanomagnet, with a magnetic tunnel junction for read-out. This simple, reliable, and efficient design may eliminate the main obstacles to the development of magnetic memory and nonvolatile spin logic technologies.}}

In parallel, topological field theory has opened the doors to the formulation and characterization of non-trivial phases of matter driven by strong electron-electron interaction. Even though important examples of topological Mott insulators have been constructed, the relevance of the underlying non-interacting band topology to the physics of the Mott phase has remained unexplored. Here, we show that the momentum structure of the Green’s function zeros defining the “Luttinger surface” provides a precise topological characterization of the Mott phase surprisingly related to the one of the single-particle electronic dispersion. Considerations on the zeros lead to the prediction of new phenomena: a topological Mott insulator with an inverted gap for the bulk zeros must possess gapless zeros at the boundary, which behave as a form of “topological antimatter” annihilating conventional edge states. Placing band and Mott topological insulators in contact produces distinctive observable signatures at the interface, revealing the otherwise spectroscopically elusive Green’s function zeros.}, note={arXiv:2301.05588 [cond-mat]}, number={arXiv:2301.05588}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Wagner, Niklas and Crippa, Lorenzo and Amaricci, Adriano and Hansmann, Philipp and Klett, Marcel and König, Elio and Schäfer, Thomas and Di Sante, Domenico and Cano, Jennifer and Millis, Andrew and Georges, Antoine and Sangiovanni, Giorgio}, year={2023}, month={Jan} }

Namely, we show that if the chemical potential sits atop the valence band, the `invariant’ changes without even accessing the conduction band but by simply traversing the band of zeros that might lie between the two bands. Since such a process does not change the many-body ground state, the Hall conductance remains fixed. This disconnect with the Hall conductance arises from the replacement of the Hamiltonian, $h(bb k)$, with $G^{-1}$ in the current operator, thereby laying plain why perturbative arguments fail.}, note={arXiv:2305.02341 [cond-mat]}, number={arXiv:2305.02341}, publisher={arXiv}, author={Zhao, Jinchao and Mai, Peizhi and Bradlyn, Barry and Phillips, Philip}, year={2023}, month={May} }
