\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:concl}

There is an increasing need for the use of HPC devices in safety-critical systems, but those devices lack enough controllability and observability channels, as well as adequate support to realize key safety measures. Hence, solutions are required to enable the safe use of HPC devices.

This paper presents our concept of a safety island and its main constituents to enable the safe use of HPC devices for safety-critical systems. In particular, we analyzed some key tradeoffs related to the degree of coupling of the safety and HPC islands, identified key components needed or highly convenient to have in the safety island to fulfill its due, and assessed some other types of applications of the safety island with overlapping needs, such as applications with RAS and/or security requirements.
