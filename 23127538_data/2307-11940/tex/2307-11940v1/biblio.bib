abstract="To cluster increasingly massive data sets that are common today in data and text mining, we propose a parallel implementation of the k-means clustering algorithm based on the message passing model. The proposed algorithm exploits the inherent data-parallelism in the k-means algorithm. We analytically show that the speedup and the scaleup of our algorithm approach the optimal as the number of data points increases. We implemented our algorithm on an IBM POWERparallel SP2 with a maximum of 16 nodes. On typical test data sets, we observe nearly linear relative speedups, for example, 15.62 on 16 nodes, and essentially linear scaleup in the size of the data set and in the number of clusters desired. For a 2 gigabyte test data set, our implementation drives the 16 node SP2 at more than 1.8 gigaflops.",

abstract = {Machine-Learning tasks are becoming pervasive in a broad range of domains, and in a broad range of systems (from embedded systems to data centers). At the same time, a small set of machine-learning algorithms (especially Convolutional and Deep Neural Networks, i.e., CNNs and DNNs) are proving to be state-of-the-art across many applications. As architectures evolve towards heterogeneous multi-cores composed of a mix of cores and accelerators, a machine-learning accelerator can achieve the rare combination of efficiency (due to the small number of target algorithms) and broad application scope.Until now, most machine-learning accelerator designs have focused on efficiently implementing the computational part of the algorithms. However, recent state-of-the-art CNNs and DNNs are characterized by their large size. In this study, we design an accelerator for large-scale CNNs and DNNs, with a special emphasis on the impact of memory on accelerator design, performance and energy.We show that it is possible to design an accelerator with a high throughput, capable of performing 452 GOP/s (key NN operations such as synaptic weight multiplications and neurons outputs additions) in a small footprint of 3.02 mm2 and 485 mW; compared to a 128-bit 2GHz SIMD processor, the accelerator is 117.87x faster, and it can reduce the total energy by 21.08x. The accelerator characteristics are obtained after layout at 65 nm. Such a high throughput in a small footprint can open up the usage of state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms in a broad set of systems and for a broad set of applications.},

abstract = {Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have proven to be a disruptive technology in most vision, speech and image processing tasks. Given their ubiquitous acceptance, the research community is investing a lot of time and resources on deep neural networks. Custom hardware such as ASICs are proving to be extremely worthy platforms for running such programs. However, the ever-increasing complexity of these algorithms poses challenges in achieving real-time performance. Specifically, CNNs have prohibitive costs in terms of computation time, throughput, latency, storage space, memory bandwidth, and power consumption. Hence, in the last 5 years, a lot of work has been done by the scientific community to mitigate these costs. Researchers have primarily focused on reducing the computation time, the number of computations, the memory access time, and the size of the memory footprint. In this survey paper, we propose a novel taxonomy to classify prior work, and describe some of the key contributions in these areas in detail.}
