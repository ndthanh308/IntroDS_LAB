  "abstract": "Grothendieck's theory of blended extensions (extensions panachées) gives a natural framework to study 3-step filtrations in abelian categories. We give a generalization of this theory that is suitable for filtrations with an arbitrary finite number of steps. We use this generalization to study two natural classification problems for objects with a fixed associated graded in an abelian category equipped with a filtration similar to the weight filtration on mixed Hodge structures. We then give an application to the study of mixed motives with a given associated graded and maximal unipotent radicals of motivic Galois groups. We prove a homological classification result for such motives when the given associated graded is \"graded-independent\", a condition defined in the paper. The special case of this result for motives with 3 weights was proved earlier with K. Murty under some extra hypotheses.",

  "comment": "Changes have been made to improve the exposition of the paper and make it more concise. A major part of the paper is now in the generality of an abelian (rather than, tannakian) category with a weight filtration. The rest of the main results and the proofs are essentially unchanged. The appendix and its application have been removed to improve the flow and shorten the paper",
