  "abstract": "We explore phase behaviour of a binary colloidal system under external spatially periodic modulation. We perform Monte Carlo simulation on a binary mixture of big and small repulsive Lennard-Jones particles with diameter ratio 1:2. We characterise structure by isotropic and anisotropic pair correlation function, cluster size distribution, bond angle distribution, order parameter and specific heat. We observe demixing of the species in the absence of the external modulation. However, mixing of the species gets enhanced with increasing potential strength. The de-mixing order parameter shows discontinuity and the specific heat shows a peak with increasing modulation strength, characterizing a first order phase transition.",
