This paper proposes a meta-learning framework for off-road traversability estimation. Our traversability prediction network predicts terrain traversability derived from vehicle-terrain interactions and generates a dense and continuous-valued cost map from a single-sweep LiDAR point cloud. Meta-learning is used to train a global model that can accurately predict terrain traversability in a variety of environments by minimizing uncertainty. During deployment, the network performs online adaptation utilizing recent interaction experiences to improve the accuracy of predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can reduce the uncertainty of the global model, resulting in stable off-road navigation in unstructured and unknown terrains. We believe this concept can be used for the broader deployment of autonomous robots in unstructured environments and improve the reliability and generalizability of off-road navigation systems that utilize self-supervision for learning traversability.

In future work, we intend to extend this framework using multiple sensor fusions to reduce uncertainty, such as RGB-LiDAR fusion. In addition, the integration of this framework for obtaining accurate terrain representation with vehicle dynamics learning would enhance the effectiveness of off-road high-speed navigation.
