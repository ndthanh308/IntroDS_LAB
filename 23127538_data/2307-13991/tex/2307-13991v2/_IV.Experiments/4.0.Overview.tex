In this section, we validate the efficacy of our proposed framework. We first demonstrate that our method is capable of learning a global model that minimizes uncertainty in prediction, resulting in a more accurate prediction of traversability costs in diverse environments. We then verify that this accurate and dependable traversability cost prediction leads to stable and effective off-road navigation. 

Our experiments address the following key questions: \textbf{(Q1)}~Can our method learn a global model that minimizes uncertainty for learning traversability in various environments? \textbf{(Q2)}~Does our method facilitate safe and effective navigation in unstructured environments? \textbf{(Q3)}~Can our traversability prediction network adapt effectively to unknown terrains during navigation?
