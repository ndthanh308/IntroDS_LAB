This section details our proposed framework for learning traversability. First, we present our traversability cost prediction network, which predicts the traversability cost derived from vehicle-terrain interaction and generates a dense cost map in BEV using a single sweep LiDAR point cloud. Then, we describe our meta-learning method for training the network~(\textit{METAVerse}) to acquire a global model that is generalizable in various environments.
