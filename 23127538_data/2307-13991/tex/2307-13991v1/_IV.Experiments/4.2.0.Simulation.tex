We demonstrate that our method can result in stable navigation (\textbf{Q2}-\textbf{Q3}) by integrating our traversability cost map with a sampling-based model-predictive controller. A high-fidelity vehicle dynamics simulator~-~IPG CarMaker is utilized for the experiments, which enables navigation in a controlled setup and, thus, enables more comprehensive comparisons and analyses of the results. In all experiments, navigation is performed only using local traversability maps generated from LiDAR point clouds with no prior knowledge of the environments. Note that our network runs in real time along with the LiDAR update rate of $10$ hz.

\subsubsection{Experimental Setup}

For navigation, we employ the Smooth Model Predictive Path Integral~(SMPPI)~\cite{kim_smooth_2022} controller, a sampling-based model predictive controller that can generate smooth actions during deployment. Table ~\ref{table:mppi} lists the controller's parameters. Based on our previous work \cite{kim_smooth_2022}, we formulate a simple state-dependent running cost function $q(\vx_t)$ of the controller:
\begin{equation}
    q(\vx_t) = \alpha_1{\text{Track}(\vx_t)} + \alpha_2{\text{Stable}(\vx_t)} + \alpha_3{\text{Speed}(\vx_t)},
\end{equation} where $\vx_t$ represents the vehicle state and $\text{Stable}(\vx_t)$ is based on the traversability cost map generated by our method. Based on our previous work~\cite{seo2023scate}, $\text{Track}(\vx_t)$ imposes a significant penalty on regions with high uncertainty, or namely non-traversable regions. $\text{Speed}(\vx_t)$ is a simple quadratic cost that penalizes the difference between the target speed and the vehicle's current speed. Each cost is normalized into $[0, 1]$, and the weight coefficients are set as  $\alpha_1 > \alpha_2 > \alpha_3$. This setting ensures that the vehicle navigates only through traversable regions, and within those regions, it optimizes the trajectory to minimize traversability costs while maintaining the target speed as much as possible.

Based on our previous work~\cite{kim2023bridging}, we use a probabilistic ensemble neural network as the vehicle dynamics. The state and action inputs follow the simplified bicycle model, and it also leverages the history of state action pairs to extract contextual information. For real-time implementation, we use a four-layer MLP and five ensembles.
