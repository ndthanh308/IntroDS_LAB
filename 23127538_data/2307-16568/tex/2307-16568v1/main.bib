Assuming a spherical BLR geometry, we adopt a Local Optimally emitting Cloud (LOC) model for the BLR that approximately reproduces the broad emission-line strengths of the strongest UV lines (Ly α and C iv) in NGC 5548. Within this LOC framework, we explore how assumptions about the gas hydrogen density and column density distributions influence flux and delay spectra of the DC. We find that: (i) models which match well measured emission-line luminosities and time delays also produce a significant DC component, (ii) increased \\$\\rm \\{\\mathit\\{ n\\}\_H\\}\\$ and/or \\$\\rm \\{\\mathit\\{ N\\}\_H\\}\\$, particularly at smaller BLR radii, result in larger DC luminosities and reduced DC delays, (iii) in a given continuum band the relative importance of the DC component to the measured interband delays is proportional (though not 1:1) to its fractional contribution to the total light in that band, (iv) the measured DC delays and DC variability amplitude depend also on the variability amplitude and characteristic variability time-scale of the driving continuum, (v) the DC radial surface emissivity distributions F(r) approximate power laws in radius with indices close to −2 (≈1:1 response to variations in the driving continuum flux), thus their physics is relatively simple and less sensitive to the unknown geometry and uncertainties in radiative transfer. Finally, we provide a simple recipe for estimating the DC contribution in disc reverberation mapping experiments.}",

We present the results of the largest study to date of the relationship between the X-ray, UV and optical variability in an AGN with 554 observations, over a 750 d period, of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548 with Swift. There is a good overall correlation between the X-ray and UV/optical bands, particularly on short time-scales (tens of days). The UV/optical bands lag the X-ray band with lags which are proportional to wavelength raised to the power 1.23 ± 0.31. This power is very close to the power (4/3) expected if short time-scale UV/optical variability is driven by reprocessing of X-rays by a surrounding accretion disc. The observed lags, however, are longer than expected from a standard Shakura–Sunyaev accretion disc with X-ray heating, given the currently accepted black hole mass and accretion rate values, but can be explained with a slightly larger mass and accretion rate, and a generally hotter disc. Some long-term UV/optical variations are not paralleled exactly in the X-rays, suggesting an additional component to the UV/optical variability arising perhaps from accretion rate perturbations propagating inwards through the disc.}",

@article{Nunez2019,
abstract = {We present the results of a two year optical continuum photometric reverberation mapping campaign carried out on the nucleus of the Seyfert-1 galaxy Mrk509. Specially designed narrow-band filters were used in order to mitigate the line and pseudo-continuum contamination of the signal from the broad line region, while allowing for high-accuracy flux-calibration over a large field of view. We obtained light curves with a sub-day time sampling and typical flux uncertainties of 1{\%}. The high photometric precision allowed us to measure inter-band continuum time delays of up to ∼2 days across the optical range. The time delays are consistent with the relation $\tau$∝$\lambda$4/3 predicted for an optically thick and geometrically thin accretion disk model. The size of the disk is, however, a factor of 1.8 larger than predictions based on the standard thin-disk theory. We argue that, for the particular case of Mrk509, a larger black hole mass due to the unknown geometry scaling factor can reconcile the difference between the observations and theory.},

@article{Kokubo2018,
abstract = {Two years' worth of u-, g-, r-, i-, and z-band optical light curves were obtained for the massive type 1 quasar PG 2308+098 at z = 0.433 using the 1.05 m Kiso Schmidt telescope/Kiso Wide Field Camera, and inter-band time lags of the light curves were measured. Wavelength-dependent continuum reverberation lag signals of several tens of days relative to the u-band were detected at g, r, i, and z bands, where the longer wavelength bands showed larger lags. From the wavelength-dependent lags, and assuming the standard disk temperature radial profile T ∝ Rdisk−3/4 and an X-ray/far-ultraviolet reprocessing picture, a constraint on the radius of the accretion disk responsible for the rest-frame 2500 {\AA} disk continuum emission was derived as Rdisk = 9.46+0.29−3.12 light-day. The derived disk size is slightly (1.2-1.8 times) larger than the theoretical disk size of Rdisk = 5.46 light-day predicted from the black hole mass (MBH) and Eddington ratio estimates of PG 2308+098. This result is roughly in accordance with previous studies of lower-mass active galactic nuclei (AGNs), where measured disk sizes have been found to be larger than the standard disk model predictions by a factor of ∼3; however, the disk size discrepancy is more modest in PG 2308+098. By compiling literature values of the disk size constraints from continuum reverberation and gravitational microlensing observations for AGNs/quasars, we show that the MBH dependence of Rdisk is weaker than that expected from the standard disk model.

abstract = {NGC 5548 has been well spectroscopically monitored for reverberation mapping of the central kinematics by 19 campaigns. Using the maximum entropy method in this Letter, we build up a high-quality velocity-delay map of the H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} emission line in the light curves of the continuum and the line variations observed between 2015-2016. The map shows the response strength and lags of the velocity fields of the H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} emitting regions. The velocity-delay structure of the map is generally symmetric, with strong red and blue wings at time lag {\$}\backslashtau \backslashleq 15{\$} days, a narrower velocity distribution at {\$}\backslashtau \backslashgeq 15{\$} days, and a deficit of response in the core. This is suggestive of a disk geometry of the broad-line region (BLR). The relatively weaker H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} response at the longer lags in the red side indicates anisotropic emission from the outer part of the BLR. We also recover the velocity-delay maps of NGC 5548 from the historical data of 13 years to investigate the long-term variability of its BLR. In general, the BLR of NGC 5548 was switching between the inflow and virialized phases in the past years. The resultant maps of seven years reveal inflow signatures and show decreasing lags, indicating that the changes in the BLR size are related to the infalling BLR gas. The other four maps show potential disk signatures which are similar to our map.},

abstract = {We present the results from a detailed analysis of photometric and spectrophotometric data on five Seyfert 1 galaxies observed as a part of a recent reverberation mapping program. The data were collected at several observatories over a 140-day span beginning in 2010 August and ending in 2011 January. We obtained high sampling-rate light curves for Mrk 335, Mrk 1501, 3C120, Mrk 6, and PG2130+099, from which we have measured the time lag between variations in the 5100 Angstrom continuum and the H-beta broad emission line. We then used these measurements to calculate the mass of the supermassive black hole at the center of each of these galaxies. Our new measurements substantially improve previous measurements of MBH and the size of the broad line-emitting region for four sources and add a measurement for one new object. Our new measurements are consistent with photoionization physics regulating the location of the broad line region in active galactic nuclei.},

abstract = {We present an improved and expanded simply parameterized phenomenological model of the broad line region (BLR) in active galactic nuclei (AGN) for modeling reverberation mapping data. By modeling reverberation mapping data directly, we can constrain the geometry and dynamics of the BLR and measure the black hole mass without relying on the normalization factor needed in the traditional analysis. For realistic simulated reverberation mapping datasets of high-quality, we can recover the black hole mass to {\$}0.05-0.25{\$} dex uncertainty and distinguish between dynamics dominated by elliptical orbits and inflowing gas. While direct modeling of the integrated emission line light curve allows for measurement of the mean time lag, other details of the geometry of the BLR are better constrained by the full spectroscopic dataset of emission line profiles. We use this improved model of the BLR to explore possible sources of uncertainty in measurements of the time lag using cross-correlation function (CCF) analysis and in measurements of the black hole mass using the virial product. Sampling the range of geometries and dynamics in our model of the BLR suggests that the theoretical uncertainty in black hole masses measured using the virial product is on the order of 0.25 dex. These results support the use of the CCF to measure time lags and the virial product to measure black hole masses when direct modeling techniques cannot be applied, provided the uncertainties associated with the interpretation of the results are taken into account.},

abstract = {The correlation observed between monochromatic X-ray and UV luminosities in radiatively-efficient active galactic nuclei (AGN) lacks a clear theoretical explanation despite being used for many applications. Such a correlation, with its small intrinsic scatter and its slope that is smaller than unity in log space, represents the compelling evidence that a mechanism regulating the energetic interaction between the accretion disk and the X-ray corona must be in place. This ensures that going from fainter to brighter sources the coronal emission increases less than the disk emission. We discuss here a self-consistently coupled disk-corona model that can identify this regulating mechanism in terms of modified viscosity prescriptions in the accretion disk. The model predicts a lower fraction of accretion power dissipated in the corona for higher accretion states. We then present a quantitative observational test of the model using a reference sample of broad-line AGN and modeling the disk-corona emission for each source in the L X − L UV plane. We used the slope, normalization, and scatter of the observed relation to constrain the parameters of the theoretical model. For non-spinning black holes and static coronae, we find that the accretion prescriptions that match the observed slope of the L X − L UV relation produce X-rays that are too weak with respect to the normalization of the observed relation. Instead, considering moderately-outflowing Comptonizing coronae and/or a more realistic high-spinning black hole population significantly relax the tension between the strength of the observed and modeled X-ray emission, while also predicting very low intrinsic scatter in the L X − L UV relation. In particular, this latter scenario traces a known selection effect of flux-limited samples that preferentially select high-spinning, hence brighter, sources.},

abstract = {We model the time variability of similar to 9000 spectroscopically confirmed quasars in SDSS Stripe 82 as a damped random walk (DRW). Using 2.7 million photometric measurements collected over 10 yr, we confirm the results of Kelly et al. and Kozlowski et al. that this model can explain quasar light curves at an impressive fidelity level (0.01-0.02 mag). The DRW model provides a simple, fast (O(N) for N data points), and powerful statistical description of quasar light curves by a characteristic timescale (tau) and an asymptotic rms variability on long timescales (SF(infinity)). We searched for correlations between these two variability parameters and physical parameters such as luminosity and black hole mass, and rest-frame wavelength. Our analysis shows SF(infinity) to increase with decreasing luminosity and rest-frame wavelength as observed previously, and without a correlation with redshift. We find a correlation between SF(infinity) and black hole mass with a power-law index of 0.18 +/- 0.03, independent of the anti-correlation with luminosity. We find that t increases with increasing wavelength with a power-law index of 0.17, remains nearly constant with redshift and luminosity, and increases with increasing black hole mass with a power-law index of 0.21 +/- 0.07. The amplitude of variability is anti-correlated with the Eddington ratio, which suggests a scenario where optical fluctuations are tied to variations in the accretion rate. However, we find an additional dependence on luminosity and/or black hole mass that cannot be explained by the trend with Eddington ratio. The radio-loudest quasars have systematically larger variability amplitudes by about 30{\%}, when corrected for the other observed trends, while the distribution of their characteristic timescale is indistinguishable from that of the full sample. We do not detect any statistically robust differences in the characteristic timescale and variability amplitude between the full sample and the small subsample of quasars detected by ROSAT. Our results provide a simple quantitative framework for generating mock quasar light curves, such as currently used in LSST image simulations.},

Using a sample of OGLE quasar light curves, we consider four modifications to the DRW model by introducing additional parameters into the covariance function to search for deviations from the DRW model on both short and long time scales. We find good agreement with the DRW model on time scales that are well sampled by the data (from a month to a few years), possibly with some intrinsic scatter in the additional parameters, but this conclusion depends on the statistical test employed and is sensitive to whether the estimates of the photometric errors are correct to within {\~{}}10{\%}. On very short time scales (below a few months), we see some evidence of the existence of a cutoff below which the correlation is stronger than the DRW model, echoing the recent finding of Mushotzky et al. (2011) using quasar light curves from Kepler. On very long time scales ({\textgreater} a few years), the light curves do not constrain models well, but are consistent with the DRW model.},

It is now widely accepted that the optical variability of AGN is stochastic, producing red noise-like light curves. In case they were to be periodic or quasi-periodic, one should expect that the time scales of optical AGN variability should relate to orbiting time scales of regions inside the accretion disks with temperatures mainly emitting the light in this wavelength range. Knowing the reverberation scales and masses of AGN, expected orbiting time scales are in the order of decades. Unfortunately, most of monitored AGN light curves are not long enough to investigate such time scales of periodicity. Here we investigate the AGN optical variability time scales and their possible connections with the broad emission line shapes.},

abstract = {We modified the broadband photometric reverberation mapping (PRM) code, JAVELIN, and tested the availability to get broad line region (BLR) time delays that are consistent with the spectroscopic reverberation mapping (SRM) project SDSS-RM. The broadband light curves of SDSS-RM quasars produced by convolution with the system trans- mission curves were used in the test. We found that under similar sampling conditions (evenly and frequently sampled), the key factor determining whether the broadband PRM code can yield lags consistent with the SRM project is the flux ratio of the broad emission line to the reference continuum, which is in line with the previous findings. We further found a critical line-to-continuum flux ratio, about 6{\%}, above which the mean of the ratios between the lags from PRM and SRM becomes closer to unity, and the scatter is pronouncedly reduced. We also tested our code on a subset of SDSS Stripe 82 quasars, and found that our program tends to give biased lag estimations due to the observation gaps when the R-L relation prior in Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is discarded. The performance of the damped random walk (DRW) model and the power-law (PL) structure function model on broadband PRM were compared. We found that given both SDSS-RM-like or Stripe 82-like light curves, the DRW model performs better in carrying out broadband PRM than the PL model.},

abstract = {Type 1 active galactic nuclei display broad emission lines, regarded as arising from photoionized gas moving in the gravitational potential of a supermassive black hole. The origin of this broad-line region gas is unresolved so far, however. Another component is the dusty torus beyond the broad-line region, likely an assembly of discrete clumps that can hide the region from some viewing angles and make them observationally appear as Type 2 objects. Here we report that these clumps moving within the dust sublimation radius, like the molecular cloud G2 discovered in the Galactic center, will be tidally disrupted by the hole, resulting in some gas becoming bound at smaller radii while other gas is ejected and returns to the torus. The clumps fulfill necessary conditions to be photoionized. Specific dynamical components of tidally disrupted clumps include spiral-in gas as inflow, circularized gas, and ejecta as outflow. We calculate various profiles of emission lines from these clouds, and find they generally agree with H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} profiles of Palomar-Green quasars. We find that asymmetry, shape and shift of the profiles strongly depend on [O III], luminosity, which we interpret as a proxy of dusty torus angles. Tidally disrupted clumps from the torus may represent the source of the broad-line region gas.},

We report measurements of C IV $\lambda$1549, HeII $\lambda$1640, and O III] $\lambda$1663 paired to measurements of H$\beta$, HeII $\lambda$4686, and Fe II{\_}opt{\_} in 52 low-redshift AGNs (z {\textless}{\~{}}0.8). Ultraviolet archival spectra covering the region of C IV $\lambda$1549 were obtained with the Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Moderate- resolution optical spectra ({\~{}}4-7 A) were obtained in most cases within two years of the HST observations. We present an atlas of matching C IV $\lambda$1549 and H$\beta$b broad-line profiles. Velocity centroids at different profile heights and other profile properties were measured after removal of narrow-line components and contaminating satellite lines of other elements. Our results add refinements to the "standard view" of nebular conditions in the broad-line region (BLR). (1) The average electron density is most probably weighted toward values higher than expected in standard BLR models. The weakness of O III] $\lambda$1663 and N IV] $\lambda$1486 relative to He II $\lambda$1640 suggest that the semiforbidden lines are collisionally de-excited at n{\_}e{\_} {\textgreater}{\~{}} 10{\^{}}10.5{\^{}} cm{\^{}}- 3{\^{}}. (2) There is evidence, supporting earlier work, that photoionization via Ly$\alpha$ fluorescence plays a major role in the production of Fe II{\_}UV{\_}. We identify and discuss briefly the Fe II{\_}UV{\_} multiplets in the range 1550-1750 A. (3) The observational distinction between the narrow- and broad-line regions is blurred by the contribution of a region of intermediate density (10{\^{}}6{\^{}} cm{\^{}}-3{\^{}} {\textless}{\~{}} n{\_}e{\_} {\textless}{\~{}} 10{\^{}}7{\^{}} cm{\^{}}-3{\^{}}). Best evidence for this emission comes from the [O III] $\lambda$4363 and C IV $\lambda$1549 profiles. It is most likely associated with the innermost part of the narrow-line region. Comparisons between the broad-line profile of C IV $\lambda$1549, H$\beta$ and, whenever possible, HeII $\lambda$1640 suggest (1) that radio- loud and radio-quiet AGNs are very different classes of objects that should be treated separately, and (2) that ionization structure varies within the velocity field. The extreme radial velocity emission is characterized by a high-ionization spectrum dominated by C IV $\lambda$ 1549 and HeII. Several basic results are: (i) C IV $\lambda$1549 is almost always blueshifted with respect to H$\beta$. (ii) There is a fundamental kinematic difference between radio loud and radio-quiet objects relative to the rest frame of the AGN. (iii) Radio-loud objects show predominantly redshifted and asymmetric H$\beta$ and unshifted symmetric C IV $\lambda$1549. (iv) Radio-quiet objects show predominantly blueshifted and asymmetric C IV profiles with H$\beta$ usually symmetric and unshifted. Correlation analysis of the radio-quiet sample suggests that C IV $\lambda$1549 EW, C IV $\lambda$1549 shift/asymmetry, and the strength of Fe II{\_}opt{\_} are related. C IV $\lambda$1549 profiles with large blueshift/asymmetry show lower EW and stronger Fe II{\_}opt{\_} emission. The results suggest that C IV $\lambda$1549 and H$\beta$ arise in different velocity/geometry regimes. C IV $\lambda$1549 may be predominantly emitted in an outflowing bicone of large aperture ({\~{}}45{\^{}}deg{\^{}}), while Fe II{\_}opt{\_} is most probably emitted in a strongly flattened geometry (possibly an accretion disk). Bulk H$\beta$ emission may come from a less flattened configuration of clouds. In this interpretation, the flux ratio Fe II{\_}opt{\_}/H$\beta${\_}BC{\_} is an aspect indicator for radio-quiet objects. Radio-loud objects are more enigmatic, and the existence of a reliable optical aspect indicator remains uncertain. There is evidence that line profile properties of C IV $\lambda$1549 and H$\beta$ are "coupled" in the radio-loud sample, suggesting that a common origin for the high- and low- ionization line emission is a possibility. If this is true, however, we do not have a reasonable explanation for the predominance of H$\beta$ redshifts and red asymmetries in that population.},

abstract = {Reverberation mapping technique is an important milestone in AGN demographics, kinematics and the structure of the Broad Line Region (BLR) based on the time-delay response between the continuum and emission line. The time delay is directly related to the size of BLR which is related to the continuum luminosity of the source, producing the well-known Radius-Luminosity (RL) relation. The majority of sources have been monitored for their H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} emission line in low redshift sources ({\$}z{\textless}0.1{\$}), while there are some attempts using the MgII line for higher redshifts. We present a recent MgII monitoring for the quasar CTS C30.10 ({\$}z=0.90{\$}) observed with the 10-meter SALT, for which RL scaling based on MgII holds within measurement and time-delay uncertainties. One of the most important advantages of reverberation mapping technique is the independent determination to the distant source, and considering the large range of redshifts and luminosities found in AGNs, their application to cosmology is promising. However, recently it has been found that highly accreting sources show the time delays shorter than expected from RL relation. We propose correction for this effect using a sample of 117 H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} reverberating-mapped AGNs with {\$}0.02{\textless}z{\textless}0.9{\$}, recovering the low scatter along with the relation. We are able to determine the cosmological constants, {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}m{\$} and {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}\backslashLambda{\$} within 2{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} confidence level. We present the first steps in modelling of light curves for H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} and MgII and discuss the quasar selection in the context of photometric reverberation mapping with Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST). With the onset of the LSST era, we expect a huge rise in the overall quasar counts and redshift range covered ({\$}z\backslashlesssim 7.0{\$}), which will provide a better constraint of AGN properties with cosmological purposes.},

abstract = {Context. High-energy $\gamma$-rays, which are produced by powerful relativistic jets, are usually associated with blazars and radio galaxies. In the current active galactic nuclei (AGN) paradigm, such jets are almost exclusively launched from massive elliptical galaxies. Recently , however, Fermi/LAT detected $\gamma$-rays from a few narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies and thus confirmed the presence of relativistic jets in them. Since NLS1 galaxies are assumed to be young evolving AGN, they offer a unique opportunity to study the production of relativistic jets in late-type galaxies. Aims. Our aim is to estimate by which processes the emission of various kinds is produced in NLS1 galaxies and to study how emission properties are connected to other intrinsic AGN properties. Methods. We have compiled the so far largest multiwavelength database of NLS1 sources. This allowed us to explore correlations between different wavebands and source properties using, for example, Pearson and Spearman correlations and principal component analysis. We did this separately for radio-loud and radio-quiet sources. Results. Multiwavelength correlations suggest that radio-loud sources host relativistic jets that are the predominant sources of radio, optical, and X-ray emission. The origin of infrared emission remains unclear. Radio-quiet sources do not host a jet, or the jet is very weak. In them, radio and infrared emission is more likely generated via star formation processes, and the optical and X-ray emission originate in the inner parts of the AGN. We also find that the black hole mass correlates significantly with radio loudness, which suggests that NLS1 galaxies with more massive black holes are more likely to be able to launch powerful relativistic jets.},

abstract = {Swift intensive accretion disk reverberation mapping of four AGN yielded light curves sampled {\$}\backslashsim{\$}200-350 times in 0.3-10 keV X-ray and six UV/optical bands. Uniform reduction and cross-correlation analysis of these datasets yields three main results: 1) The X-ray/UV correlations are much weaker than those within the UV/optical, posing severe problems for the lamp-post reprocessing model in which variations in a central X-ray corona drive and power those in the surrounding accretion disk. 2) The UV/optical interband lags are generally consistent with {\$} \backslashtau \backslashpropto \backslashlambda{\^{}}{\{}4/3{\}} {\$} as predicted by the centrally illuminated thin accretion disk model. While the average interband lags are somewhat larger than predicted, these results alone are not inconsistent with the thin disk model given the large systematic uncertainties involved. 3) The one exception is the U band lags, which are on average a factor of {\$}\backslashsim{\$}2.2 larger than predicted from the surrounding band data and fits. This excess appears due to diffuse continuum emission from the broad-line region (BLR). The precise mixing of disk and BLR components cannot be determined from these data alone. The lags in different AGN appear to scale with mass or luminosity. We also find that there are systematic differences between the uncertainties derived by javelin vs. more standard lag measurement techniques, with javelin reporting smaller uncertainties by a factor of 2.5 on average. In order to be conservative only standard techniques were used in the analyses reported herein.},

Therefore, the execution of extensive surveys of the sky, with different types of detectors, is providing the attractive possibility to identify and to investigate the properties of AGNs on very large statistical samples. Thanks to the large spectroscopic surveys that allow detailed investigation of many of these sources, we have the opportunity to place new constraints on the nature and evolution of AGNs and to investigate their relations with the host systems. In this contribution we present the results that can be obtained by using a new interactive catalogue that we developed to investigate the range of AGN spectral energy distributions (SEDs). We present simple SED models based on data collected in the catalogue and discuss their relations with optical spectra obtained by follow up observations. We compare our findings with the expectations based on the AGN Unification Model, and we discuss the perspectives of multi-wavelength approaches to address AGN related processes such as black hole accretion and acceleration of relativistic jets.},

abstract = {Although the extragalactic nature of quasars was discussed as early as 1960 by John Bolton and others it was rejected largely because of preconceived ideas about what appeared to be an unrealistically-high radio and optical luminosity. Following the 1962 observation of the occultations of the strong radio source 3C 273 with the Parkes Radio Telescope and the subsequent identification by Maarten Schmidt of an apparent stellar object, Schmidt recognized that the simple hydrogen line Balmer series spectrum implied a redshift of 0.16. Successive radio and optical measurements quickly led to the identification of other quasars with increasingly-large redshifts and the general, although for some decades not universal, acceptance of quasars as being by far the most distant and the most luminous objects in the Universe. However, due to an error in the calculation of the radio position, it appears that the occultation position played no direct role in the identification of 3C 273, although it was the existence of a claimed accurate occultation position that motivated Schmidt's 200-in Palomar telescope investigation and his determination of the redshift. Curiously, 3C 273, which is one of the strongest extragalactic sources in the sky, was first catalogued in 1959, and the 13 th magnitude optical counterpart was observed at least as early as 1887. Since 1960, much fainter optical counterparts were being routinely identified, using accurate radio interferometer positions which were measured primarily at the Caltech Owens Valley Radio Observatory. However, 3C 273 eluded identification until the series of lunar occultation observations led by Cyril Hazard. Although an accurate radio position had been obtained earlier with the Owens Valley Interferometer, inexplicably 3C 273 was misidentified with a faint galaxy located about one arc minute away from the true position. It appears that the Parkes occultation position played only an indirect role in the identification of the previously-suspected galactic star, which was only recognized as the optical counterpart after Schmidt's 200-in observations showed it to have a peculiar spectrum corresponding to a surprisingly-large redshift.},

abstract = {The Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4593 was monitored spectroscopically with the Hubble Space Telescope as part of a reverberation mapping campaign that also included Swift, Kepler and ground-based photometric monitoring. During 2016 July 12 - August 6, we obtained 26 spectra across a nearly continuous wavelength range of {\~{}}1150 - 10,000A. These were combined with Swift data to produce a UV/optical "lag spectrum", which shows the interband lag relative to the Swift UVW2 band as a function of wavelength. The broad shape of the lag spectrum appears to follow the {\$}\backslashtau \backslashpropto \backslashlambda{\^{}}{\{}4/3{\}}{\$} relation seen previously in photometric interband lag measurements of other active galactic nuclei (AGN). This shape is consistent with the standard thin disk model but the magnitude of the lags implies a disk that is a factor of {\~{}}3 larger than predicted, again consistent with what has been previously seen in other AGN. In all cases these large disk sizes, which are also implied by independent gravitational microlensing of higher-mass AGN, cannot be simply reconciled with the standard model. However the most striking feature in this higher resolution lag spectrum is a clear excess around the 3646A Balmer jump. This strongly suggests that diffuse emission from gas in the much larger broad-line region (BLR) must also contribute significantly to the interband lags. While the relative contributions of the disk and BLR cannot be uniquely determined in these initial measurements, it is clear that both will need to be considered in comprehensively modeling and understanding AGN lag spectra.},

abstract = {We use the microlensing variability observed for 11 gravitationally lensed quasars to show that the accretion disk size at a rest-frame wavelength of 2500 {\AA} is related to the black hole mass by log(R 2500 /cm) = (15.78 ± 0.12) + (0.80 ± 0.17) log(M BH /10 9 M). This scaling is consistent with the expectation from thin-disk theory (R ∝ M 2/3 BH), but when interpreted in terms of the standard thin-disk model (T ∝ R −3/4), it implies that black holes radiate with very low efficiency, log($\eta$) = −1.77 ± 0.29 + log(L/L E), where $\eta$ = L/(˙ Mc 2). Only by making the maximum reasonable shifts in the average inclination, Eddington factors, and black hole masses can we raise the efficiency estimate to be marginally consistent with typical efficiency estimates ($\eta$ ≈ 10{\%}). With one exception, these sizes are larger by a factor of ∼4 than the size needed to produce the observed 0.8 $\mu$m quasar flux by thermal radiation from a thin disk with the same T ∝ R −3/4 temperature profile. While scattering a significant fraction of the disk emission on large scales or including a large fraction of contaminating line emission can reduce the size discrepancy, resolving it also appears to require that accretion disks have flatter temperature/surface brightness profiles.},

We measured H$\backslash$beta$\backslash$ time lags for all three targets and estimated masses of their black holes -- for the first time in the case of Mrk 841. For Mrk 79 and NGC 3227, the data are of sufficient quality to resolve distinct time lags as a function of velocity and to compute two-dimensional velocity-delay maps. Mrk 79 shows smaller time lags for high-velocity gas but the distribution is not symmetric, and its complex velocity-delay map could result from the combination of both inflowing and outflowing H$\backslash$beta$\backslash$ emitting disks that may be part of a single larger structure. NGC 3227 shows the largest time lags for blueshifted gas and the two-dimensional velocity-delay map suggests a disk with some inflow. We compare our results with previous work and find evidence for different time lags despite similar luminosities, as well as evolving broad line region structures.},

However, the huge radiative power of most AGN cannot be seen directly, as the accretion is hidden behind gas and dust that absorb many of the characteristic observational signatures. This obscuration presents an important challenge for uncovering the complete AGN population and understanding the cosmic evolution of SMBHs. In this review, we describe a broad range of multiwavelength techniques that are currently being employed to identify obscured AGN, and we assess the reliability and completeness of each technique. We follow with a discussion of the demographics of obscured AGN activity, explore the nature and physical scales of the obscuring material, and assess the implications of obscured AGN for observational cosmology. We conclude with an outline of the prospects for future progress from both observations and theoretical models, and we highlight some of the key outstanding questions.},

abstract = {(abridged) We have spectrophotometrically monitored a well-defined sample of 28 Palomar-Green quasars in order to obtain measurements of their BLRs and to investigate the relationships between quasar luminosity, central black hole mass, and broad emission line region (BLR) size in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Spectrophotometry was obtained every 1-4 months for 7.5 years, yielding 20-70 observing epochs per object. Both the continuum and emission line fluxes of all of the quasars were observed to change during the duration of the observing program. Seventeen of the 28 objects were observed with adequate sampling to search for correlated variations between the Balmer emission lines and the continuum flux. For each of these 17 objects, a significant correlation was observed, with the Balmer line variations lagging those of the continuum by $\backslash${\~{}}100 days (rest frame). Our work increases the available luminosity range for studying the size-mass-luminosity relations in AGN by two orders of magnitude and doubles the number of objects suitable for such studies. Combining our results with comparable published data available for Seyfert 1 galaxies, we find the BLR size scales with the rest-frame 5100 A luminosity as L{\^{}}{\{}0.70+-0.03{\}}. This determination of the scaling of the size of the BLR as a function of luminosity is significantly different from those previously published, and suggests that the effective ionization parameter in AGN may be a decreasing function of luminosity. We are also able to constrain, subject to our assumption that gravity dominates the motions of the BLR gas, the scaling relationship between the mass of the central black holes and the luminosity in AGN: M $\backslash$propto L{\^{}}{\{}0.5+-0.1{\}}. This is inconsistent with all AGN having optical luminosity that is a constant fraction of the Eddington luminosity.},

abstract = {In our second paper on long-term quasar variability, we employ a much larger database of quasars than in de Vries, Becker {\&} White. This expanded sample, containing 35,165 quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 2 and 6413 additional quasars in the same area of the sky taken from the Two Degree Field (2dF) QSO Redshift Survey, allows us to significantly improve on our earlier conclusions. As before, all the historic quasar photometry has been calibrated onto the SDSS scale by using large numbers of calibration stars around each quasar position. We find the following: (1) The outbursts have an asymmetric light-curve profile, with a fast-rise, slow-decline shape; this argues against a scenario in which microlensing events along the line of sight to the quasars are dominating the long-term variations in quasars. (2) There is no turnover in the structure function of the quasars up to timescales of {\~{}}40 yr, and the increase in variability with increasing time lags is monotonic and constant. (3) Consequently, there is not a single preferred characteristic outburst timescale for the quasars, but most likely a continuum of outburst timescales. (4) The magnitude of the quasar variability is a function of wavelength: variability increases toward the blue part of the spectrum. (5) High-luminosity quasars vary less than low-luminosity quasars, consistent with a scenario in which variations have limited absolute magnitude. On this basis, we conclude that quasar variability is intrinsic to the active galactic nucleus and is caused by chromatic outbursts or flares that have limited luminosity range, varying timescales, and an overall asymmetric light-curve shape. Currently, the model that has the most promise of fitting the observations is based on accretion disk instabilities.},

abstract = {This is the eighth in a series of papers reporting on a large reverberation mapping campaign to measure black hole (BH) mass in high accretion rate active galactic nuclei (AGNs). We employ the recently developed dynamical modeling approach for broad-line regions (BLRs) based on the method of Pancoast et al. to analyze the reverberation mapping dataset of Mrk 142 observed in the first monitoring season. In this approach, continuum variations are reconstructed using a damped random walk process, and BLR structure is delineated using a flexible disk-like geometry, in which BLR clouds move around the central BH with Keplerian orbits or inflow/outflow motion. The approach also includes the possibilities of anisotropic emission of BLR clouds, non-linear response of the line emission to the continuum, and different long-term trends in the continuum and emission-line variations. We implement the approach in a Bayesian framework that is apt for parallel computation and use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique to recover the parameters and uncertainties for the modeling, including mass of the central BH. We apply three BLR models with different prescriptions of BLR clouds distributions and find that the best model for fitting the data of Mrk 142 is a two-zone BLR model, consistent with the theoretical BLR model surrounding slim accretion disks. The best model yields a BH mass of {\$}\backslashlog (M{\_}\backslashbullet/M{\_}\backslashodot)=6.23{\_}{\{}-0.45{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+0.26{\}}{\$}, resulting in a virial factor of {\$}\backslashlog f=-0.36{\_}{\{}-0.54{\}}{\^{}}{\{}+0.33{\}}{\$} for the full width at half maximum of the H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} line measured from the mean spectrum.

In the rest frame of the source, the lags between optical and NIR bands are found to be {\$}27.1{\^{}}{\{}+13.5{\}}{\_}{\{}-12.0{\}}{\$} days (V vs. J), {\$}30.4{\^{}}{\{}+13.9{\}}{\_}{\{}-12.0{\}}{\$} days (V vs. H) and {\$}34.6{\^{}}{\{}+12.1{\}}{\_}{\{}-9.6{\}}{\$} days (V vs. K ). The lags between the optical and different NIR bands are thus consistent with each other. The measured lags indicate that the inner edge of dust torus is located at a distance of 0.029 pc from the central UV/optical AGN continuum. This is larger than the radius of the broad line region of this object determined from spectroscopic monitoring observations thereby supporting the unification model of AGN. The location of H0507+164 in the {\{}$\backslash$tau{\}} - MV plane indicates that our results are in excellent agreement with the now known lag-luminosity scaling relationship for dust in AGN.},

abstract = {NGC 5548 has been intensively monitored by the AGN Space Telescope and Optical Reverberation Mapping collaboration. Approximately after half of the light curves, the correlation between the broad emission lines and the lag-corrected ultraviolet continua becomes weak. This anomalous behavior is accompanied by an increase of soft X-ray emission. We propose a simple model to understand this anomalous behavior, i.e., the corona might fall down, thereby increasing the covering fraction of the inner disk. Therefore, X-ray and extreme ultraviolet emission suffer from spectral variations. The ultraviolet continua variations are driven by both X-ray and extreme ultraviolet variations. Consequently, the spectral variability induced by the falling corona would dilute the correlation between the broad emission lines and the ultraviolet continua. Our model can explain many additional observational facts, including the dependence of the anomalous behavior on velocity and ionization energy. We also show that the time lag and correlation between the X-ray and the ultraviolet variations change as NGC 5548 displays the anomalous behavior. The time lag is dramatically longer than the expectation from disk reprocessing if the anomalous behavior is properly excluded. During the anomalous state, the time lag approaches the light-travel timescale of disk reprocessing albeit with a much weaker correlation. We speculate that the time lag in the normal state is caused by reprocessing of the broad line region gas. As NGC 5548 enters the abnormal state, the contribution of the broad line region gas is smaller; the time lag reflects disk reprocessing. We also discuss alternative scenarios.},

These quasars have redshifts ranging up to 4 and have apparent AB magnitudes between 16.8 mag {\textless} r {\textless} 22.5 mag. The aim of the survey is to measure time lags between fluctuations in the quasar continuum and broad emission-line fluxes of individual objects in order to measure black hole masses for a broad range of active galactic nuclei (AGN) and constrain the radius-luminosity (R-L) relationship. Here we investigate the expected efficiency of the OzDES reverberation mapping campaign and its possible extensions. We expect to recover lags for ̃35-45 per cent of the quasars. AGN with shorter lags and greater variability are more likely to yield a lag measurement, and objects with lags {\{}$\backslash$ensuremath{\{}$\backslash$lesssim{\}}{\}}6 months or ̃1 yr are expected to be recovered the most accurately. The baseline OzDES reverberation mapping campaign is predicted to produce an unbiased measurement of the R-L relationship parameters for H {\{}$\backslash$ensuremath{\{}$\backslash$beta{\}}{\}}, Mg II {\{}$\backslash$ensuremath{\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}{\}}2798, and C IV {\{}$\backslash$ensuremath{\{}$\backslash$lambda{\}}{\}}1549.

We used Swift and the Las Cumbres Observatory global telescope network to continuously monitor Fairall 9 from X-rays to near-infrared at a daily to subdaily cadence. The cross-correlation function between bands provides evidence for a lag spectrum consistent with the $\tau$ ∝ $\lambda$4/3 scaling expected for an optically thick, geometrically thin blackbody accretion disc. Decomposing the flux into constant and variable components, the variable component's spectral energy distribution is slightly steeper than the standard accretion disc prediction. We find evidence at the Balmer edge in both the lag and flux spectra for an additional bound-free continuum contribution that may arise from reprocessing in the broad-line region. The inferred driving light curve suggests two distinct components, a rapidly variable ({\textless}4 d) component arising from X-ray reprocessing, and a more slowly varying ({\textgreater}100 d) component with an opposite lag to the reverberation signal.},

abstract = { Context. The size and geometry of the broad-line region (BLR) in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are among the main ingredients in determining the mass of the accreting black hole. Size and geometry can be constrained by determining the delay between the optical continuum and the flux reprocessed by the BLR, in particular, through the emission lines.  Aims. We propose here that the delay between polarized and unpolarized light can also be used in much the same way to constrain the size of the BLR; we verify that meaningful results can be expected from observations using this technique.  Methods. We used our code STOKES to simulate polarized radiative transfer. We determined the response of the environment of the central source (BLR, dust torus, and polar wind) to randomly generated fluctuations in the central source. We then calculated the cross correlation between the simulated polarized flux and the total flux to estimate the time delay that would be provided by observations using the same method.  Results. The BLR is the main contributor to the delay between the polarized flux and the total flux. This delay is independent of the observation wavelength.  Conclusions. This validates the use of polarized radiation in the optical/UV band to estimate the geometrical properties of the BLR in type I AGNs, in which the viewing angle is close to pole-on and the BLR is not obscured by the dust torus. },

abstract = {Broad emission lines of active galactic nuclei stem from a spatially extended region (broad-line region, BLR) that is composed of discrete clouds and photoionized by the central ionizing continuum. The temporal behaviors of these emission lines are blurred echoes of continuum variations (i.e., reverberation mapping, RM) and directly reflect the structures and kinematic information of BLRs through the so-called transfer function (also known as the velocity-delay map). Based on the previous works of Rybicki and Press and Zu et al., we develop an extended, non-parametric approach to determine the transfer function for RM data, in which the transfer function is expressed as a sum of a family of relatively displaced Gaussian response functions. Therefore, arbitrary shapes of transfer functions associated with complicated BLR geometry can be seamlessly included, enabling us to relax the presumption of a specified transfer function frequently adopted in previous studies and to let it be determined by observation data. We formulate our approach in a previously well-established framework that incorporates the statistical modeling of continuum variations as a damped random walk process and takes into account long-term secular variations which are irrelevant to RM signals. The application to RM data shows the fidelity of our approach.},

Several spacetimes have already been implemented and tested. We demonstrate the validity of BHAC by means of various one-, two-, and three-dimensional test problems, as well as through a close comparison with the HARM3D code in the case of a torus accreting onto a black hole. The convergence of a turbulent accretion scenario is investigated with several diagnostics and we find accretion rates and horizon-penetrating fluxes to be convergent to within a few percent when the problem is run in three dimensions. Our analysis also involves the study of the corresponding thermal synchrotron emission, which is performed by means of a new general-relativistic radiative transfer code, BHOSS. The resulting synthetic intensity maps of accretion onto black holes are found to be convergent with increasing resolution and are anticipated to play a crucial role in the interpretation of horizon-scale images resulting from upcoming radio observations of the source at the Galactic Center.},

abstract = {The super-massive black holes of 10 6 M [ to 10 9 M [ that reside in the nuclei of active galaxies 1 (AGN) are surrounded by a region emitting broad lines, probably associated with an accretion disk. The diameters of the broad-line regions range from a few light-days to more than a hundred light-days 1 , and cannot be resolved spatially. The relative significance of inflow, outflow, rotational or turbulent motions in the broad-line regions as well as their structure (spherical, thin or thick accretion disk) are unknown despite intensive studies over more than thirty years 2,3. Here we report a fundamental relation between the observed emission linewidth full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) and the emission line shape FWHM/s line in AGN spectra. From this relation we infer that the predominant motion in the broad-line regions is Keplerian rotation in combination with turbulence. The geometry of the inner region varies systematically with the rotation velocity: it is flattest for the fast-rotating broad-line objects, whereas slow-rotating narrow-line AGN have a more spherical structure. Superimposed is the trend that the line-emitting region becomes geometrically thicker towards the centre within individual galaxies. Knowing the rotational velocities, we can derive the central black-hole masses more accurately; they are two to ten times smaller than has been estimated previously. We investigated in detail the broad optical and ultraviolet emission line profiles of the largest homogeneous data set 1 of reverberation-mapped AGN to learn more about the kinematics and structure of the central broad-line-emitting regions in AGN. Usually the observed broad-line profiles are more or less contaminated by narrow emission lines. We therefore inspected the root-mean-square (r.m.s.) line profiles because they display clean profiles of the variable broad emission lines (the narrow-line profiles disappear in these spectra because they are constant over timescales of years). Broad-line profiles can be para-meterized by the ratio of their FWHM to their line dispersion s line. The relationship between FWHM and s line gives us information about the shape of the profile. We used all optical and ultraviolet line profiles of the original AGN sample consisting of 37 objects (see Supplementary Table 1). We generated separated diagrams of the r.m.s. linewidth ratios FWHM/s line versus linewidth FWHM as well as FWHM/s line versus s line for all emission lines (Hb, Ha, He II, C IV...) of the AGN sample. Figures 1 to 3 show the linewidth ratios FWHM/s line versus linewidth FWHM for Hb, He II l 5 4,686 A ˚ and C IV l 5 1,550 A ˚. The shape of the line profiles varies systematically with FWHM, but has a different gradient for different emission lines. In an earlier study 4 the AGN sample 1 was divided into two populations on the basis of their Hb line dispersion s line , with a division line at s line 5 2,000 km s 21. In a second step we determined the correlation coefficients between the observed linewidth ratios FWHM/s line versus FWHM as well as between FWHM/s line versus s line. Table 1 lists the correlation coefficients r (Pearson, Spearman and Kendall) and the probabilities P for random percentage correlations for Hb, He II l 5 4,686 A ˚ , and C IV l 5 1,550 A ˚. In all cases we obtained an even higher correlation coefficient for the linewidth ratio FWHM/s line versus FWHM than for FWHM/s line versus s line. The shape of the line profiles varies systematically with the line-width, as can be seen in Figs 1 to 3. The broader line profiles become more flat-topped. The relationship between FWHM and s line gives us information about the shape of the profile: a Gaussian profile has FWHM/s line {\textless} 2.35, a rectangular profile has FWHM/s line {\textless} 3.46, and the FWHM/s line goes to zero for Lorentzian and logarithmic line profiles 1,4. In a third step we tried to model all the observed line profile relations in a simple way using multiple combinations of Gaussian, double-Gaussian, Voigt, Lorentzian, logarithmic and rectangular profiles-but},

abstract = {The radius-luminosity (R-L) relationship of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) established by the reverberation mapping (RM) observations has been widely used as a single-epoch black hole mass estimator in the research of large AGN samples. However, the recent RM campaigns discovered that the AGNs with high accretion rates show shorter time lags by factors of a few comparing with the predictions from the R-L relationship. The explanation of the shortened time lags has not been finalized yet. We collect 8 different single-epoch spectral properties to investigate how the shortening of the time lags correlate with those properties and to understand what is the origin of the shortened lags. We find that the flux ratio between Fe II and H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} emission lines shows the most prominent correlation, thus confirm that accretion rate is the main driver for the shortened lags. In addition, we establish a new scaling relation including the relative strength of Fe II emission.

abstract = {We present the results of an optical spectroscopic monitoring program targeting NGC 5548 as part of a larger multi-wavelength reverberation mapping campaign. The campaign spanned six months and achieved an almost daily cadence with observations from five ground-based telescopes. The H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} and He II {\$}\backslashlambda{\$}4686 broad emission-line light curves lag that of the 5100 {\$}\backslashAA{\$} optical continuum by {\$}4.17{\^{}}{\{}+0.36{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.36{\}}{\$} days and {\$}0.79{\^{}}{\{}+0.35{\}}{\_}{\{}-0.34{\}}{\$} days, respectively. The H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} lag relative to the 1158 {\$}\backslashAA{\$} ultraviolet continuum light curve measured by the Hubble Space Telescope is roughly {\$}\backslashsim{\$}50{\%} longer than that measured against the optical continuum, and the lag difference is consistent with the observed lag between the optical and ultraviolet continua. This suggests that the characteristic radius of the broad-line region is {\$}\backslashsim{\$}50{\%} larger than the value inferred from optical data alone. We also measured velocity-resolved emission-line lags for H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} and found a complex velocity-lag structure with shorter lags in the line wings, indicative of a broad-line region dominated by Keplerian motion. The responses of both the H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} and He II {\$}\backslashlambda{\$}4686 emission lines to the driving continuum changed significantly halfway through the campaign, a phenomenon also observed for C IV, Ly {\$}\backslashalpha{\$}, He II(+O III]), and Si IV(+O IV]) during the same monitoring period. Finally, given the optical luminosity of NGC 5548 during our campaign, the measured H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} lag is a factor of five shorter than the expected value implied by the {\$}R{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}BLR{\}} - L{\_}\backslashmathrm{\{}AGN{\}}{\$} relation based on the past behavior of NGC 5548.},

abstract = {We present a statistical study of a large, homogeneously analyzed sample of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies, accompanied by a comparison sample of broad-line Seyfert 1 (BLS1) galaxies. Optical emission-line and continuum properties are subjected to correlation analyses, in order to identify the main drivers of the correlation space of active galactic nuclei (AGNs), and of NLS1 galaxies in particular. For the first time, we have established the density of the narrow-line region as a key parameter in Eigenvector 1 space, as important as the Eddington ratio L/L Edd. This is important because it links the properties of the central engine with the properties of the host galaxy, i.e., the interstellar medium (ISM). We also confirm previously found correlations involving the line width of H$\beta$ and the strength of the Fe ii and [O iii] $\lambda$5007 emission lines, and we confirm the important role played by L/L Edd in driving the properties of NLS1 galaxies. A spatial correlation analysis shows that large-scale environments of the BLS1 and NLS1 galaxies of our sample are similar. If mergers are rare in our sample, accretion-driven winds, on the one hand, or bar-driven inflows, on the other hand, may account for the strong dependence of Eigenvector 1 on ISM density.},

abstract = {We discuss three long term observational programmes to probe the central engine and environment of active galactic nuclei (AGN) using the recently installed ARIES 1.3-m and 3.6-m telescopes. The first programme is on the photometric reverberation mapping of low luminosity AGN by mainly using the ARIES 1.3-m telescope. The major impact of this programme other than to estimate the black hole mass will be to extend the broad line region (BLR) radius- luminosity (RBLR-LAGN) relation to the unexplored low luminosity regime, and to constrain the AGN broad line region geometry. The second programme is to use long slit spectroscopy on the ARIES 3.6-m telescope to discover new high redshift quasar pairs with angular separation less than 1-arcmin. Here, the background QSOs sight-line will be used to probe the environment of the foreground QSOs at kpc-Mpc scales. The major impact of this programme will be on the discovery of new pairs which have been missed in the SDSS survey due to fiber collision below 1-arcmin separation, and use them to understand about any excess overdensity around the QSO, any anisotropic emission of QSOs, and/or any episodic activity of QSOs. The third programme is related to spectral variability studies of the C IV broad absorption line (BAL) QSOs, based on low resolution spectroscopy using the ARIES 3.6-m telescope. Here, those most interesting cases will be monitored, where the BAL flow emerges afresh or disappears completely in the C IV trough of BAL QSOs sample as seen in SDSS multi-epoch observations. Continuous monitoring of such a sample will be important for our understanding of the nature and origin of the flow, along with their stability and dynamical evolution.},

abstract = {We have completed two years of photometric and spectroscopic monitoring of a large number of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with very high accretion rates. In this paper, we report on the result of the second phase of the campaign, during 2013--2014, and the measurements of five new H{\$}\backslashbackslashbeta{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}} time lags out of eight monitored AGNs. All five objects were identified as super-Eddington accreting massive black holes (SEAMBHs). The highest measured accretion rates for the objects in this campaign are {\$}\backslashbackslashdot{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}\backslashbackslashmathscr{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}M{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}\backslashbackslashgtrsim 200{\$}, where {\$}\backslashbackslashdot{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}\backslashbackslashmathscr{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}M{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}= \backslashbackslashdot{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}M{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashbackslashbullet{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}/L{\_}{\{}\backslashbackslashrm Edd{\}}c{\^{}}{\{}-2{\}}{\$}, {\$}\backslashbackslashdot{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}M{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\_}{\{}\backslashbackslashbullet{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\$} is the mass accretion rates, {\$}L{\_}{\{}\backslashbackslashrm Edd{\}}{\$} is the Eddington luminosity and {\$}c{\$} is the speed of light. We find that the H{\$}\backslashbackslashbeta{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}} time lags in SEAMBHs are significantly shorter than those measured in sub-Eddington AGNs, and the deviations increase with increasing accretion rates. Thus, the relationship between broad-line region size ({\$}R{\_}{\{}{\_}{\{}\backslashbackslashrm H\backslashbackslashbeta{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\}}{\$}) and optical luminosity at 5100{\$}\backslash{\$}AA, {\$}R{\_}{\{}{\_}{\{}\backslashbackslashrm H\backslashbackslashbeta{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\}}-L{\_}{\{}5100{\}}{\$}, requires accretion rate as an additional parameter. We propose that much of the effect may be due to the strong anisotropy of the emitted slim-disk radiation. Scaling {\$}R{\_}{\{}{\_}{\{}\backslashbackslashrm H\backslashbackslashbeta{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\}}{\$} by the gravitational radius of the black hole, we define a new radius-mass parameter ({\$}Y{\$}) and show that it saturates at a critical accretion rate of {\$}\backslashbackslashdot{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}\backslashbackslashmathscr{\{}\backslash{\{}{\}}M{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\{}\backslash{\}}{\}}{\_}c=6\backslashbackslashsim 30{\$}, indicating a transition from thin to slim accretion disk and a saturated luminosity of the slim disks. The parameter {\$}Y{\$} is a very useful probe for understanding the various types of accretion onto massive black holes. We briefly comment on implications to the general population of super-Eddington AGNs in the universe and applications to cosmology.},

abstract = {We have recently completed a 64-night spectroscopic monitoring campaign at the Lick Observatory 3-m Shane telescope with the aim of measuring the masses of the black holes in 12 nearby (z {\textless} 0.05) Seyfert 1 galaxies with expected masses in the range {\~{}}10{\^{}}6-10{\^{}}7M{\_}sun and also the well-studied nearby active galactic nucleus (AGN) NGC 5548. Nine of the objects in the sample (including NGC 5548) showed optical variability of sufficient strength during the monitoring campaign to allow for a time lag to be measured between the continuum fluctuations and the response to these fluctuations in the broad Hbeta emission, which we have previously reported. We present here the light curves for the Halpha, Hgamma, HeII 4686, and HeI 5876 emission lines and the time lags for the emission-line responses relative to changes in the continuum flux. Combining each emission-line time lag with the measured width of the line in the variable part of the spectrum, we determine a virial mass of the central supermassive black hole from several independent emission lines. We find that the masses are generally consistent within the uncertainties. The time-lag response as a function of velocity across the Balmer line profiles is examined for six of the AGNs. Finally we compare several trends seen in the dataset against the predictions from photoionization calculations as presented by Korista {\&} Goad. We confirm several of their predictions, including an increase in responsivity and a decrease in the mean time lag as the excitation and ionization level for the species increases. Further confirmation of photoionization predictions for broad-line gas behavior will require additional monitoring programs for these AGNs while they are in different luminosity states. [abridged]},

abstract = {In the framework of microscopic theory of black hole (MTBH), which explores the most important processes of rearrangement of vacuum state and spontaneous breaking of gravitation gauge symmetry at huge energies, we have undertaken a large series of numerical simulations with the goal to trace an evolution of the mass assembly history of 377 plausible accreting supermassive black hole seeds in active galactic nuclei (AGNs) to the present time and examine the observable signatures today. Given the redshifts, masses, and luminosities of these black holes at present time collected from the literature, we compute the initial redshifts and masses of the corresponding seed black holes. For the present masses M B H / M ⊙ ≃ 1.1 × 1 0 6 to 1.3 × 1 0 10 of 377 black holes, the computed intermediate seed masses are ranging from M B H S e e d / M ⊙ ≃ 26.4 to 2.9 × 1 0 5 . We also compute the fluxes of ultrahigh energy (UHE) neutrinos produced via simple or modified URCA processes in superdense protomatter nuclei. The AGNs are favored as promising pure UHE neutrino sources, because the computed neutrino fluxes are highly beamed along the plane of accretion disk, peaked at high energies, and collimated in smaller opening angle ( $\theta$ ≪ 1 ).},

abstract = {In recent years, several Radio-Loud Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (RL-NLS1) possessing relativistic jets have come into attention with their detections in Very Large Baseline Array (VLBA) and in $\gamma$-ray observations. In this paper we attempt to understand the nature of radio-jets in NLS1s by examining the kpc-scale radio properties of, hitherto, the largest sample of 11101 optically-selected NLS1s. Using 1.4 GHz FIRST, 1.4 GHz NVSS, 327 MHz WENNS, and 150 MHz TGSS catalogues we find the radio-detection of merely ∼ 4.5 per cent (498/11101) NLS1s, with majority (407/498 ∼ 81.7 per cent) of them being RL-NLS1s. Our study yields the highest number of RL-NLS1s and it can only be a lower limit. We find that the most of our radio-detected NLS1s are compact ({\textless} 30 kpc), exhibit both flat as well as steep radio spectra, and are distributed across a wide range of 1.4 GHz radio luminosities (10 22 − 10 27 W Hz −1). At the high end of radio luminosity our NLS1s often tend to show blazar-like properties such as compact radio-size, flat/inverted radio spectrum, radio variability and polarization. The diagnostic plots based on the mid-IR colours suggest that the radio emission in NLS1s is mostly powered by AGN, while nuclear star-formation may have a significant contribution in NLS1s of low radio luminosities. The radio luminosity versus radio-size plot infers that the radio-jets in NLS1s are either in the early evolutionary phase or possibly remain confined within the nuclear region due to low-power or intermittent AGN activity.},

abstract = {Variations in the strengths of the central photoionizing source in a quasar or Seyfert galaxy will generate variations in the strengths and profiles of the emission Unes. These " reverberations " in the emission Unes will lag behind the continuum variations due to Ught travel time effects. A procedure is described for analyzing a time series of measurements of both the continuum and the Unes. This procedure permits direct verification of the assumed causal connection of the Unes to the continuum. We demonstrate that if the emission Une region has a high degree of symmetry, then it is possible to invert the time-dependent Une profiles and obtain the phase space distribution of the emission-Une gas—i.e., its emissivity and the moments of its velocity distribution as functions of position. The cases of spherical and disk symmetry are considered in detail; the case of a straight jet, which may be relevant to correlated optical and radio variations, is discussed briefly. Explicit calculations of expected line variations have been carried out for several simple models. We suggest that with recently developed instrumentation it should now be possible to apply this technique to Seyfert galaxies. Long term, highly accurate observations will be required for the appUcation to quasars.},

The ultraviolet continuum flux and broad emission line fluxes varied significantly, going through three large maxima and three deep minima. The ratio of maximum to minimum flux was {\^{}}4.5 for the continuum at 1350 A, and the continuum was significantly bluer when it was brighter. The high-ionization emission lines showed the strong-est variations, with N v A1240 and He ii 21640 exhibiting maximum-to-minimum flux ratios as high as those of the continuum.

abstract = {Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are found in the centres of most galaxies. Their masses, and hence their gravitational potentials, are negligible compared with those of the host galaxy. However, several strong correlations between SMBH masses and host galaxy properties have been observed, notably the {\$}M-\backslashsigma{\$} relation connecting the SMBH mass to the characteristic velocity of stars in the galaxy. The existence of these correlations implies that the SMBH influences the evolution of its host galaxy. In this review, we present the most promising physical model of this influence, known as the Active galactic nucleus (AGN) wind feedback model. Winds launched from the accretion disc around the SMBH can drive powerful outflows, provided that the SMBH is massive enough - this condition establishes the {\$}M-\backslashsigma{\$} relation. Outflows can have a profound influence on the evolution of the host galaxy, by compressing its gas and driving it out, affecting the star formation rate. We present the current status of the model and the observational evidence for it, as well as the directions of future research.},

We also find that more massive quasars have larger accretion disks, similarly consistent with the analytic accretion-disk model. The data are inconclusive on a correlation between disk size and continuum luminosity, with results that are consistent with both no correlation and with the $\backslash$citet{\{}SS73{\}} expectation. The continuum lag fits have a large excess dispersion, indicating that our measured lag errors are underestimated and/or our best-fit model may be missing the effects of orientation, spin, and/or radiative efficiency.

abstract = {Moderate-resolution (150-300 km s-1) spectra of the H{\ss}-[0 m] X5007 region have been obtained for 41 radio-loud quasars in order to investigate relationships among their broad-and narrow-line profiles, radio structures , and X-ray properties. Comparable spectra from the literature have been included to form a data set of 60 radio-loud quasars with similar numbers of core-and lobe-dominated quasars. A variety of statistical analyses have been performed, including rank correlation tests and principal-component analysis, which identify several strong, related trends. The dominant source of variation in the H{\ss} line profile parameters is related to radio core dominance, which measures the orientation of the central engine in the rela-tivistic-beaming model (both the traditional R and a new core-dominance parameter R v are used). As core dominance increases, the equivalent widths EW Hj s and EW5007 decrease, H{\ss} wings (the red in particular) weaken and H{\ss} becomes more symmetric, and Fe ii/[0 ni] X5007 increases. The above changes in H{\ss} are interpreted as the spectrum-to-spectrum variation of a redshifted, very broad component (FWHM-8000-9000 km s-1). Secondary variations in H{\ss} appear to involve a narrower component (FWHM {\~{}} 2000 km s-1), with a strength unrelated to the core dominance or luminosity but strongly correlated with the strength of [O in] X5007. Another set of significantly correlated parameters involves the [O hi] X5007 profile, continuum luminosity, and spectral shape: [O in] X5007 is broader when the optical-to-X-ray spectral index a ox (F p a v{\~{}} a °*) and the optical lumi-nosity are larger; the narrow-fine (NLR) component of H{\ss} also gets stronger relative to [O in] X5007, and there is a component of variation in EW Hj 8 and EW5007 in the sense of a Baldwin effect. These results, as well as some noteworthy noncorrelations, are briefly discussed in terms of underlying physical causes and other results from the literature. A quantitative comparison with other classes of active galactic nuclei is deferred to a forthcoming paper.},

abstract = {Jets powered by active galactic nuclei appear impressively stable compared with their terrestrial and laboratory counterparts-they can be traced from their origin to distances exceeding their injection radius by up to a billion times. However, some less energetic jets get disrupted and lose their coherence on the scale of their host galaxy. Quite remarkably, on the same scale, these jets are expected to become confined by the thermal pressure of the intra-galactic gas. Motivated by these observations, we have started a systematic study of active galactic nuclei jets undergoing reconfinement via computer simulations. Here, we show that in the case of unmagnetized relativistic jets, the reconfinement is accompanied by the development of an instability and transition to a turbulent state. During their initial growth, the perturbations have a highly organized streamwise-oriented structure, indicating that it is not the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability, the instability which has been the main focus of the jet stability studies so far. Instead, it is closely related to the centrifugal instability. This instability is likely to be behind the division of active galactic nuclei jets into two morphological types in the Fanaroff-Riley classification.},

abstract = {Black hole mass is a key factor in determining how a black hole interacts with its environment. However, the determination of black hole masses at high redshifts depends on secondary mass estimators, which are based on empirical relationships and broad approximations. A dynamical disk wind broad line region model (BLR) of active galactic nuclei is built in order to test the impact of different BLR geometries and inclination angles on the black hole mass estimation. Monte Carlo simulations of two disk wind models are constructed to recover the virial scale factor, f , at various inclination angles. The resulting f values strongly correlate with inclination angle, with large f values associated with small inclination angles (close to face-on) and small f values with large inclination angles (close to edge-on). The recovered f factors are consistent with previously determined f values, found from empirical relationships. Setting f as a constant may introduce a bias into virial black hole mass estimates for a large sample of active galactic nuclei. However, the extent of the bias depends on the line width characterisation (e.g. full width at half maximum or line dispersion). Masses estimated using {\$}f{\_}{\{}\backslashtext{\{}FWHM{\}}{\}}{\$} tend to be biased towards larger masses, but this can generally be corrected by calibrating for the width or shape of the emission line.},

abstract = {The origin, geometry and kinematics of the broad line region (BLR) gas in quasars and active galactic nuclei (AGN) are uncertain. We demonstrate that clumpy biconical disc winds illuminated by an AGN continuum can produce BLR-like spectra. We first use a simple toy model to illustrate that disc winds make quite good BLR candidates, because they are self-shielded flows and can cover a large portion of the ionizing flux-density ($\phi$H-nH) plane. We then conduct Monte Carlo radiative transfer and photoionization calculations, which fully account for self-shielding and multiple scattering in a non-spherical geometry. The emergent model spectra show broad emission lines with equivalent widths and line ratios comparable to those observed in AGN, provided that the wind has a volume filling factor of fV ≲ 0.1. Similar emission line spectra are produced for a variety of wind geometries (polar or equatorial) and for launch radii that differ by an order of magnitude. The line emission arises almost exclusively from plasma travelling below the escape velocity, implying that ‘failed winds' are important BLR candidates. The behaviour of a line-emitting wind (and possibly any ‘smooth flow' BLR model) is similar to that of the locally optimally-emitting cloud (LOC) model originally proposed by Baldwin et al (1995), except that the gradients in ionization state and temperature are large-scale and continuous, rather than within or between distinct clouds. Our models also produce UV absorption lines and X-ray absorption features, and the stratified ionization structure can partially explain the different classes of broad absorption line quasars.},

All objects from the Palomar Bright Quasar Survey (PBQS; Schmidt and Green) catalog with published spectral scans have been included toward a goal of determining broad-line characteristics in a complete sample of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The principal motivation for this study was to determine the range of spectral shifts exhibited by the broad lines relative to the narrow ones. We propose a simple classification scheme for broad-line H{\ss} that would note the presence of systematic line shifts and line asymmetries. We investigate two samples of AGNs: (1) 25 objects from the PBQS and (2) a less well defined sample of 36 objects selected from various literature sources. Together these samples represent virtually all published spectra accurate enough to be reliably classified in our system. Combining the two samples (n = 61) we find: (a) only nine objects show symmetric and unshifted profiles; (b) a large number (15) of displaced profiles are symmetric, with redshifts twice as common as blue ones; (c) 35 objects show a measurable wavelength shift relative to the narrow-line region [O m] (from 120 to 1900 km s 1), with redshifts (20) slightly more common than blueshifts; (d) a shifted profile is very unlikely to show a blue asymmetry (red asymmetries are 8 times more common); and (e) 37 objects show an asymmetric profile with red (27) ones almost three times as common as blue. The distribution of wavelength centroids at all four measured profile heights (allowing for a few outliers) is displaced-100 km s" 1 toward the red. This can be interpreted as evidence for a small gravitational redshift in most AGNs.},

abstract = {We conduct a multiwavelength continuum variability study of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548 to investigate the temperature structure of its accretion disk. The 19 overlapping continuum light curves (1158 to 9157 angstroms) combine simultaneous HST , Swift , and ground-based observations over a 180 day period from 2014 January to July. Light-curve variability is interpreted as the reverberation response of the accretion disk to irradiation by a central time-varying point source. Our model yields the disk inclination, i, temperature T1 at 1 light day from the black hole, and a temperature-radius slope, alpha. We also infer the driving light curve and find that it correlates poorly with both the hard and soft X-ray light curves, suggesting that the X-rays alone may not drive the ultraviolet and optical variability over the observing period. We also decompose the light curves into bright, faint, and mean accretion-disk spectra. These spectra lie below that expected for a standard blackbody accretion disk accreting at L/LEdd = 0.1},

@article{Sluse2018,
abstract = {Owing to the advent of large area photometric surveys, the possibility to use broad band photometric data, instead of spectra, to measure the size of the broad line region of active galactic nuclei, has raised a large interest. We describe here a new method using time-delay lensed quasars where one or several images are affected by microlensing due to stars in the lensing galaxy. Because microlensing decreases (or increases) the flux of the continuum compared to the broad line region, it changes the contrast between these two emission components. We show that this effect can be used to effectively disentangle the intrinsic variability of those two regions, offering the opportunity to perform reverberation mapping based on single band photometric data. Based on simulated light curves generated using a damped random walk model of quasar variability, we show that measurement of the size of the broad line region can be achieved using this method, provided one spectrum has been obtained independently during the monitoring. This method is complementary to photometric reverberation mapping and could also be extended to multi-band data. Because the effect described above produces a variability pattern in difference light curves between pairs of lensed images which is correlated with the time-lagged continuum variability, it can potentially produce systematic errors in measurement of time delays between pairs of lensed images. Simple simulations indicate that time-delay measurement techniques which use a sufficiently flexible model for the extrinsic variability are not affected by this effect and produce accurate time delays.},

abstract = {Individual light curves of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are nowadays successfully modelled with the damped random walk (DRW) stochastic process, characterized by the power exponential covariance matrix of the signal, with the power {\$}\backslashbeta=1{\$}. By Monte Carlo simulation means, we generate mock AGN light curves described by non-DRW stochastic processes ({\$}0.5\backslashleq\backslashbeta\backslashleq 1.5{\$} and {\$}\backslashbeta\backslashneq1{\$}) and show they can be successfully and well-modelled as a single DRW process, obtaining comparable goodness of fits. A good DRW fit, in fact, may not mean that DRW is the true underlying process leading to variability and it cannot be used as a proof for it. When comparing the input (non-DRW) and measured (DRW) process parameters, the recovered time scale (amplitude) increases (decreases) with the increasing input {\$}\backslashbeta{\$}. In practice, this means that the recovered DRW parameters may lead to biased (or even non-existing) correlations of the variability and physical parameters of AGNs if the true AGN variability is caused by non-DRW stochastic processes. The proper way of identifying the processes leading to variability are model-independent structure functions and/or power spectral densities and then using such information on the covariance matrix of the signal in light curve modelling.},

@article{Haas2011,
abstract = {Photometric reverberation mapping employs a wide bandpass to measure the AGN continuum variations and a suitable band, usually a narrow band (NB), to trace the echo of an emission line in the broad line region (BLR). The narrow band catches both the emission line and the underlying continuum, and one needs to extract the pure emission line light curve. We performed a test on two local AGNs, PG0003+199 (=Mrk335) and Ark120, observing well-sampled broad- (B, V) and narrow-band light curves with the robotic 15cm telescope VYSOS-6 on Cerro Armazones, Chile. In PG0003+199, H{\_}alpha dominates the flux in the NB by 85{\%}, allowing us to measure the time lag of H{\_}alpha against B without the need to correct for the continuum contribution. In Ark120, H{\_}beta contributes only 50{\%} to the flux in the NB. The cross correlation of the B and NB light curves shows two distinct peaks of similar strength, one at lag zero from the autocorrelated continuum and one from the emission line at tau{\_}cent = 47.5 +/- 3.4 days. We constructed a synthetic H{\_}beta light curve, by subtracting a scaled V light curve, which traces the continuum, from the NB light curve. The cross correlation of this synthetic H{\_}beta light curve with the B light curve shows only one major peak at tau{\_}cent = 48.0 +/- 3.3 days, while the peak from the autocorrelated continuum at lag zero is absent. We conclude that, as long as the emission line contributes at least 50{\%} to the bandpass, the pure emission line light curve can be reconstructed from photometric monitoring data so that the time lag can be measured. For both objects the lags we find are consistent with spectroscopic reverberation results. While the dense sampling (median 2 days) enables us to determine tau{\_}cent with small (10{\%}) formal errors, we caution that gaps in the light curves may lead to much larger systematic uncertainties.

AIMS: (1) To investigate how the degrees of multifractality of the continuum and H$\beta$ line vary among the five different objects and (2) to check whether the multifractal behaviors of the continuum and the H$\beta$ line correlate with standard accretion parameters. METHOD: The backward ($\theta$ = 0) one-dimensional multifractal detrended moving average procedure was applied to light curves covering the full observation period and partial observation periods containing an equal number of epochs for each object. RESULTS: We detected multifractal signatures for the continua of NGC 4151, Arp 102B and 3C 390.3 and for the H$\beta$ lines of NGC 4151 and 3C 390.3. However, we found nearly monofractal signatures for the continua of E1821+643 and NGC 7469, as well as for the H$\beta$ lines of Arp 102B, E1821+643 and NGC 7469. In addition, we did not find any correlations between the degree of multifractality of the H$\beta$ line and accretion parameters, while the degree of multifractality of the continuum seems to correlate with the Eddington ratio; i.e., the smaller the ratio is, the stronger the degree of multifractality. The given method is not robust, and these results should be taken with caution, and that future analysis of the sampling rate and other properties of the light curves should help in better constraining and understanding these results.},

Mrk 142 was monitored with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory for 4 months in X-rays and 6 UV/optical filters. Ground-based photometric monitoring was obtained from the Las Cumbres Observatory, Liverpool Telescope and Dan Zowada Memorial Observatory in ugriz filters and the Yunnan Astronomical Observatory in V. Mrk 142 was highly variable throughout, displaying correlated variability across all wavelengths. We measure significant time lags between the different wavelength light curves, finding that through the UV and optical the wavelength-dependent lags, {\$}\backslashtau(\backslashlambda){\$}, generally follow the relation {\$}\backslashtau(\backslashlambda) \backslashpropto \backslashlambda{\^{}}{\{}4/3{\}}{\$}, as expected for the {\$}T\backslashpropto R{\^{}}{\{}-3/4{\}}{\$} profile of a steady-state optically-thick, geometrically-thin accretion disk, though can also be fit by {\$}\backslashtau(\backslashlambda) \backslashpropto \backslashlambda{\^{}}{\{}2{\}}{\$}, as expected for a slim disk. The exceptions are the u and U band, where an excess lag is observed, as has been observed in other AGN and attributed to continuum emission arising in the broad-line region. Furthermore, we perform a flux-flux analysis to separate the constant and variable components of the spectral energy distribution, finding that the flux-dependence of the variable component is consistent with the {\$}f{\_}\backslashnu\backslashpropto\backslashnu{\^{}}{\{}1/3{\}}{\$} spectrum expected for a geometrically-thin accretion disk. Moreover, the X-ray to UV lag is significantly offset from an extrapolation of the UV/optical trend, with the X-rays showing a poorer correlation with the UV than the UV does with the optical. The magnitude of the UV/optical lags is consistent with a highly super-Eddington accretion rate.},

The observational parameters, RFe (the ratio of optical Fe ii to H $\beta$ line flux) and the line profile parameter DH $\beta$ ({\$}D{\_}{\{}\backslashrm H\backslash,\backslashbeta {\}} =\backslashrm FWHM(H\backslash,\backslashbeta)/\backslashsigma {\_}{\{}\backslashrm H\backslash,\backslashbeta {\}}{\$}), have relations with three kinds of {\$}\backslashdot{\{}\backslashmathscr {\{}M{\}}{\}}{\$}. Using RFe and DH $\beta$ to substitute {\$}\backslashdot{\{}\backslashmathscr {\{}M{\}}{\}}{\$}, extended empirical RBLR(H$\beta$)–L5100 relations are presented. RFe is a better ‘fix' for the RBLR(H $\beta$)–L5100 offset than the H $\beta$ shape DH $\beta$. The extended empirical RBLR(H $\beta$)–L5100 relation including RFe can be used to calculate RBLR, and thus the single-epoch SMBH mass MBH. Our measured accretion rate dependence is not consistent with the simple model of the accretion disc instability leading the BLR formation. The BLR may instead form from the inner edge of the torus, or from some other means in which BLR size is positively correlated with accretion rate and the SMBH mass.},

A feasibility study, based on numerical simulations, points to the advantages and pitfalls associated with this approach. The method is applied to a subset of the Palomar-Green quasar sample for which high quality photometric light curves and independent BLR size measurements are available. Good agreement is obtained between the results of the photometric method and the spectroscopic reverberation mapping technique. Implications for the measurement of BLR sizes and black hole masses for numerous quasars in the era of large surveys are discussed.},

abstract = {We explore the properties of the H$\beta$ emission line profile in a large, homogeneous and bright sample of N ∼ 470 low-redshift quasars extracted from Sloan Digital Sky Survey (Data Release 5). We approach the investigation from two complementary directions: composite/median spectra and a set of line diagnostic measures (asymmetry index, centroid shift and kurtosis) in individual quasars. The project is developed and presented in the framework of the so-called 4D Eigenvector 1 (4DE1) parameter space, with a focus on its optical dimensions, full width at half-maximum of broad H$\beta$[FWHM(H$\beta$)] and the relative strength of optical Fe ii[RFe ii≡ W(Fe ii4434-4684 {\AA})/W(H$\beta$)]. We reenforce the conclusion that not all quasars are alike and spectroscopically they do not distribute randomly about an average typical optical spectrum. Our results give further support to the concept of two populations A and B [narrower and broader than 4000 km s-1 FWHM(H$\beta$), respectively] that emerged in the context of 4DE1 space. The broad H$\beta$ profiles in composite spectra of Population A sources are best described by a Lorentzian and in Population B by a double Gaussian model. Moreover, high- and low-accretion sources (an alternative view of the Population A/B concept) not only show significant differences in terms of black hole (BH) and Eddington ratio Lbol/LEdd, but they also show distinct properties in terms of line asymmetry, shift and shapes. We finally suggest that a potential refinement of the 4DE1 space can be provided by separating two populations of quasars at RFe ii∼ 0.50 rather than at FWHM(H$\beta$) = 4000 km s-1. Concomitantly, the asymmetry and centroid shift profile measures at 1/4 fractional intensity can be reasonable surrogates for the FWHM(H$\beta$) dimension of the current 4DE1. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Authors.

abstract = {NGC 5548 is the best-observed reverberation-mapped active galactic nucleus with long-term, intensive monitoring. Here we report results from a new observational cam-paign between January and July, 2015. We measure the centroid time lag of the broad H$\beta$ emission line with respect to the 510 A continuum and obtain $\tau$ cent = 7.20 +1.33 −0.35 days in the rest frame. This yields a black hole mass of M • = 8.71 +3.21 −2.61 × 10 7 M ⊙ using a broad H$\beta$ line dispersion of 3124 ± 302 km s −1 and a virial factor of f BLR = 6.3 ± 1.5 for the broad-line region (BLR), consistent with the mass measurements from previous H$\beta$ campaigns. The high-quality data allow us to construct a velocity-binned delay map for the broad H$\beta$ line, which shows a symmetric response pattern around the line center, a plausible kinematic signature of virialized motion of the BLR. Combining all the avail-able measurements of H$\beta$ time lags and the associated mean 510 A luminosities over 18 campaigns between 1989 and 2015, we find that the H$\beta$ BLR size varies with the mean optical luminosity, but, interestingly, with a possible delay of 2.35 +3.47 −1.25 yrs. This delay coincides with the typical BLR dynamical timescale of NGC 5548, indicating that the BLR undergoes dynamical changes, possibly driven by radiation pressure.},

@article{Bentz2013,
abstract = {We present an updated and revised analysis of the relationship between the Hbeta broad-line region (BLR) radius and the luminosity of the active galactic nucleus (AGN). Specifically, we have carried out two-dimensional surface brightness decompositions of the host galaxies of 9 new AGNs imaged with the Hubble Space Telescope Wide Field Camera 3. The surface brightness decompositions allow us to create "AGN-free" images of the galaxies, from which we measure the starlight contribution to the optical luminosity measured through the ground-based spectroscopic aperture. We also incorporate 20 new reverberation-mapping measurements of the Hbeta time lag, which is assumed to yield the average Hbeta BLR radius. The final sample includes 41 AGNs covering four orders of magnitude in luminosity. The additions and updates incorporated here primarily affect the low-luminosity end of the R-L relationship. The best fit to the relationship using a Bayesian analysis finds a slope of alpha = 0.533 (+0.035/-0.033), consistent with previous work and with simple photoionization arguments. Only two AGNs appear to be outliers from the relationship, but both of them have monitoring light curves that raise doubt regarding the accuracy of their reported time lags. The scatter around the relationship is found to be 0.19(+/-0.02) dex, but would be decreased to 0.13 dex by the removal of these two suspect measurements. A large fraction of the remaining scatter in the relationship is likely due to the inaccurate distances to the AGN host galaxies. Our results help support the possibility that the R-L relationship could potentially be used to turn the BLRs of AGNs into standardizable candles. This would allow the cosmological expansion of the Universe to be probed by a separate population of objects, and over a larger range of redshifts.},

abstract = {The broadening of atomic emission lines by high-velocity motion of gas near accreting supermassive black holes is an observational hallmark of quasars1. Observations of broad emission lines could potentially constrain the mechanism for transporting gas inwards through accretion disks or outwards through winds2. The size of regions for which broad emission lines are observed (broad-line regions) has been estimated by measuring the delay in light travel time between the variable brightness of the accretion disk continuum and the emission lines3—a method known as reverberation mapping. In some models the emission lines arise from a continuous outflow4, whereas in others they arise from orbiting gas clouds5. Directly imaging such regions has not hitherto been possible because of their small angular size (less than 10−4 arcseconds3,6). Here we report a spatial offset (with a spatial resolution of 10−5 arcseconds, or about 0.03 parsecs for a distance of 550 million parsecs) between the red and blue photo-centres of the broad Paschen-$\alpha$ line of the quasar 3C 273 perpendicular to the direction of its radio jet. This spatial offset corresponds to a gradient in the velocity of the gas and thus implies that the gas is orbiting the central supermassive black hole. The data are well fitted by a broad-line-region model of a thick disk of gravitationally bound material orbiting a black hole of 3 × 108 solar masses. We infer a disk radius of 150 light days; a radius of 100–400 light days was found previously using reverberation mapping7–9. The rotation axis of the disk aligns in inclination and position angle with the radio jet. Our results support the methods that are often used to estimate the masses of accreting supermassive black holes and to study their evolution over cosmic time.},

abstract = {To date, the radial velocity (RV) method has been one of the most productive techniques for detecting and confirming extrasolar planetary candidates. Unfortunately, stellar activity can induce RV variations which can drown out or even mimic planetary signals-and it is notoriously difficult to model and thus mitigate the effects of these activity-induced nuisance signals. This is expected to be a major obstacle to using next-generation spectrographs to detect lower mass planets, planets with longer periods, and planets around more active stars. Enter Gaussian processes (GPs) which, we note, have a number of attractive features that make them very well suited to disentangling stellar activity signals from planetary signals. We present here a GP framework we developed to model RV time series jointly with ancillary activity indicators (e.g. bisector velocity spans, line widths, chromospheric activity indices), allowing the activity component of RV time series to be constrained and disentangled from e.g. planetary components. We discuss the mathematical details of our GP framework, and present results illustrating its encouraging performance on both synthetic and real RV datasets, including the publicly-available Alpha Centauri B dataset.},

abstract = {We present the first results from a reverberation-mapping campaign undertaken during the first half of 2012, with additional data on one AGN (NGC 3227) from a 2014 campaign. Our main goals are (1) to determine the black hole masses from continuum-Hbeta reverberation signatures, and (2) to look for velocity-dependent time delays that might be indicators of the gross kinematics of the broad-line region. We successfully measure Hbeta time delays and black hole masses for five AGNs, four of which have previous reverberation mass measurements. The values measured here are in agreement with earlier estimates, though there is some intrinsic scatter beyond the formal measurement errors. We observe velocity dependent Hbeta lags in each case, and find that the patterns have changed in the intervening five years for three AGNs that were also observed in 2007.},

abstract = {The high-ionization lines of the broad-line region (BLR) of thermal active galactic nuclei (AGNs) show blueshifts of a few hundred km/s to several thousand km/sec with respect to the low-ionization lines. This has long been thought to be due to the high-ionization lines of the BLR arising in a wind of which the far side of the outflow is blocked from our view by the accretion disc. Evidence for and against the disc-wind model is discussed. The biggest problem for the model is that velocity-resolved reverberation mapping repeatedly fails to show the expected kine-matic signature of outflow of the BLR. The disc-wind model also cannot readily reproduce the red side of the line profiles of high-ionization lines. The rapidly falling density in an outflow makes it difficult to obtain high equivalent widths. We point out a number of major problems with associating the BLR with the outflows producing broad absorption lines. An explanation which avoids all these problems and satisfies the constraints of both the line profiles and velocity-resolved reverberation-mapping is a model in which the blueshifting is due to scattering off material spiraling inwards with an inflow velocity of half the velocity of the blueshifting. We discuss how recent reverberation mapping results are consistent with the scattering-plus-inflow model but do not support a disc-wind model. We propose that the anti-correlation of the apparent redshifting of H$\beta$ with the blueshifting of C IV is a consequence of contamination of the red wings of H$\beta$ by the broad wings of [O III].},

abstract = {We describe the first results from a six-month long reverberation-mapping experiment in the ultraviolet based on 170 observations of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548 with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph on the Hubble Space Telescope. Significant correlated variability is found in the continuum and broad emission lines, with amplitudes ranging from {\~{}}30{\%} to a factor of two in the emission lines and a factor of three in the continuum. The variations of all the strong emission lines lag behind those of the continuum, with He II 1640 lagging behind the continuum by {\~{}}2.5 days and Lyman alpha 1215, C IV 1550, and Si IV 1400 lagging by {\~{}}5-6 days. The relationship between the continuum and emission lines is complex. In particular, during the second half of the campaign, all emission-line lags increased by a factor of 1.3-2 and differences appear in the detailed structure of the continuum and emission-line light curves. Velocity-resolved cross-correlation analysis shows coherent structure in lag versus line-of-sight velocity for the emission lines; the high-velocity wings of C IV respond to continuum variations more rapidly than the line core, probably indicating higher velocity BLR clouds at smaller distances from the central engine. The velocity-dependent response of Lyman alpha, however, is more complex and will require further analysis.},

abstract = {Reverberation-mapping campaigns have revolutionized our understanding of AGN. They have allowed the direct determination of the broad-line region size, enabled mapping of the gas distribution around the central black hole, and are starting to resolve the continuum source structure. This review describes the recent and successful campaigns of the International AGN Watch consortium, outlines the theoretical background of reverberation mapping and the calculation of transfer functions, and addresses the fundamental difficulties of such experiments. It shows that such large-scale experiments have resulted in a ``new BLR'' which is considerably different from the one we knew just ten years ago. We discuss in some detail the more important new results, including the luminosity-size-mass relationship for AGN, and suggest ways to proceed in the near future.},

@techreport{Berton2005,
abstract = {Line profiles can provide fundamental information on the physics of active galactic nuclei (AGN). In the case of narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) this is of particular importance since past studies revealed how their permitted line profiles are well reproduced by a Lorentzian function instead of a Gaussian. This has been explained with different properties of the broad-line region (BLR), which may present a more pronounced turbulent motions in NLS1s with respect to other AGN. We investigated the line profiles in a recent large NLS1 sample classified using SDSS, and we divided the sources into two subsamples according to their line shapes, Gaussian or Lorentzian. The line profiles clearly separate all the properties of NLS1s. Black hole mass, Eddington ratio, [O III], and Fe II strength are all very different in the Lorentzian and Gaussian samples. We interpret this in terms of evolution within the class of NLS1s. The Lorentzian sources may be the youngest objects, while Gaussian profiles may be typically associated to more evolved objects. Further detailed spectroscopic studies are needed to fully confirm our hypothesis.},

This allowed us to check for the debated luminosity and time-dependent color variations claimed for SDSS quasars. For our 3C120 data, we find that the {\$}B/V{\$} flux ratio of the variable component in the bright epoch is indistinguishable from the faint one. We do not find any color variability on different timescales ranging from about {\$}1{\$} to {\$}1800{\$} days. We suggest that the luminosity and time-dependent color variability is an artifact caused by analyzing the data in magnitudes instead of fluxes. The flux variation gradients of both epochs yield consistent estimates of the host galaxy contribution to our 7.5" aperture. These results confirm that the optical flux variation gradient method works well for Seyfert galaxies.},

@article{Wang2014,
abstract = {This is the second in a series of papers reporting on a large reverberation mapping (RM) campaign to measure black hole (BH) mass in high accretion rate active galactic nuclei (AGNs). The goal is to identify super-Eddington accreting massive black holes (SEAMBHs) and to use their unique properties to construct a new method for measuring cosmological distances. Based on theoretical models, the saturated bolometric luminosity of such sources is proportional to the BH mass which can be used to obtain their distance. Here we report on five new RM measurements and show that in four of the cases we can measure the BH mass and three of these sources are SEAMBHs. Together with the three sources from our earlier work, we now have six new sources of this type. We use a novel method based on a minimal radiation efficiency to identify nine additional SEAMBHs from earlier RM-based mass measurements. We use a Bayesian analysis to determine the parameters of the new distance expression, and the method uncertainties, from the observed properties of the objects in the sample. The ratio of the newly measured distances to the standard cosmological ones has a mean scatter of 0.14 dex, indicating that SEAMBHs can be use as cosmological distance probes. With their high luminosity, long period of activity and large numbers at high redshifts, SEAMBHs have a potential to extend the cosmic distance ladder beyond the range now explored by type Ia supernovae.},

abstract = {We present optical continuum lags for two Seyfert 1 galaxies, MCG+08-11-011 and NGC 2617, using monitoring data from a reverberation mapping campaign carried out in 2014. Our light curves span the ugriz filters over four months, with median cadences of 1.0 and 0.6 days for MCG+08-11-011 and NGC$\backslash$,2617, respectively, combined with roughly daily X-ray and near-UV data from Swift for NGC 2617. We find lags consistent with geometrically thin accretion-disk models that predict a lag-wavelength relation of {\$}\backslashtau \backslashpropto \backslashlambda{\^{}}{\{}4/3{\}}{\$}. However, the observed lags are larger than predictions based on standard thin-disk theory by factors of 3.3 for MCG+08-11-011 and 2.3 for NGC$\backslash$,2617. These differences can be explained if the mass accretion rates are larger than inferred from the optical luminosity by a factor of 4.3 in MCG+08-11-011 and a factor of 1.3 in NGC$\backslash$,2617, although uncertainty in the SMBH masses determines the significance of this result. While the X-ray variability in NGC$\backslash$,2617 precedes the UV/optical variability, the long 2.6 day lag is problematic for coronal reprocessing models.},

abstract = {Motivated by recent progress in the statistical modeling of quasar variability, we develop a new approach to measuring emission-line reverberation lags to estimate the size of broad-line regions (BLRs) in active galactic nuclei. Assuming that all emission-line light curves are scaled, smoothed, and displaced versions of the continuum, this alternative approach fits the light curves directly using a damped random walk model and aligns them to recover the time lag and its statistical confidence limits. We introduce the mathematical formalism of this approach and demonstrate its ability to cope with some of the problems for traditional methods, such as irregular sampling, correlated errors, and seasonal gaps. We redetermine the lags for 87 emission lines in 31 quasars and reassess the BLR size-luminosity relationship using 60 H$\beta$ lags. We confirm the general results from the traditional cross-correlation methods, with a few exceptions. Our method, however, also supports a broad range of extensions. In particular, it can simultaneously fit multiple lines and continuum light curves which improves the lag estimate for the lines and provides estimates of the error correlations between them. Determining these correlations is of particular importance for interpreting emission-line velocity-delay maps. We can also include parameters for luminosity-dependent lags or line responses. We use this to detect the scaling of the BLR size with continuum luminosity in NGC 5548.},

abstract = {In the near future, new surveys promise a significant increase in the number of quasars (QSO) at large redshifts. This will help to constrain the dark energy models using quasars. The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) will cover over 10 million QSO in six photometric bands during its 10-year run. QSO will be monitored and subsequently analyzed using the photometric reverberation mapping (RM) technique. In low-redshift quasars, the combination of reverberation-mapped and spectroscopic results have provided important progress. However, there are still some facts which have to be taken into account for future results. It has been found that super-Eddington sources show time delays shorter than the expected from the well-known Radius-Luminosity ({\$}R\backslashmathrm{\{}{\_}{\{}H\backslashbeta{\}}{\}}-L{\_}{\{}5100{\}}{\$}) relation. Using a sample of 117 H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} reverberation-mapped AGN with {\$}0.02{\textless}z{\textless}0.9{\$}, we propose a correction by the accretion rate effect recovering the classical {\$}R\backslashmathrm{\{}{\_}{\{}H\backslashbeta{\}}{\}}-L{\_}{\{}5100{\}}{\$} relation. We determined the cosmological constants, which are in agreement with {\$}\backslashLambda{\$}-Cold Dark Matter model within 2{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} confidence level, which is still not suitable for testing possible departures from the standard model. Upcoming LSST data will decrease the uncertainties in the dark energy determination using reverberation-mapped sources, particularly at high redshifts. We show the first steps in the modeling of the expected light curves for H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} and MgII.},

Using the WE satellite, the nucleus of NGC 5548 was observed every 4 days for a period of 8 months. Its mean properties—continuum shape, line ratios—are not unusual for type I Seyfert galaxies, but it was found to be strongly variable. The ultraviolet continuum flux and broad emission line fluxes varied significantly, going through three large maxima and three deep minima. The ratio of maximum to minimum flux was {\^{}}4.5 for the continuum at 1350 A, and the continuum was significantly bluer when it was brighter. The high-ionization emission lines showed the strong-est variations, with N v A1240 and He ii 21640 exhibiting maximum-to-minimum flux ratios as high as those of the continuum. Intermediate-ionization lines, including Lya 21216, C iv 21549, and C in] 21909, had maximum-to-minimum amplitudes of {\~{}}2, and Mg ii 22798, the lowest ionization line, exhibited the smallest amplitude fluctuations, {\~{}} 1.3. The great majority of all variations were well resolved in time. Apart from Mg n 22798, the emission-line variations correlate extremely well with those of the 1350 A continuum if allowance is made for a systematic delay, lending qualitative support to the view that photoionization by the nuclear},

abstract = {We present Bayesian AGN Decomposition Analysis for SDSS Spectra, an open source spectral analysis code designed for automatic detailed deconvolution of AGN and host galaxy spectra, implemented in Python, and designed for the next generation of large scale surveys. The code simultaneously fits all spectral components, including power-law continuum, stellar line-of-sight velocity distribution, Fe ii emission, as well as forbidden (narrow), permitted (broad), and outflow emission line features, all performed using Markov Chain Monte Carlo to obtain robust uncertainties and autocorrelation analysis to assess parameter convergence. Our code also utilizes multiprocessing for batch fitting large samples of spectra while efficiently managing memory and computation resources and is currently being used in a cluster environment to fit thousands of SDSS spectra. We use our code to perform a correlation analysis of 63 SDSS type 1 AGNs with evidence of strong non-gravitational outflow kinematics in the [O iii]$\lambda$5007 emission feature. We confirm findings from previous studies that show the core of the [O iii] profile is a suitable surrogate for stellar velocity dispersion $\sigma$*, however there is evidence that the core experiences broadening that scales with outflow velocity. We find sufficient evidence that $\sigma$*, [O iii] core dispersion, and the non-gravitational outflow dispersion of the [O iii] profile form a plane whose fit results in a scatter of ∼0.1 dex. Finally, we discuss the implications, caveats, and recommendations when using the [O iii] dispersion as a surrogate for $\sigma$* for the MBH − $\sigma$* relation.},

These galaxies have been selected from the 16th data release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-DR16). Some of the properties derived from single epoch spectrum vary significantly between the two populations. We find that the emission regions of Narrow line Seyfert galaxies are rich in iron content and the accretion rate is higher compared to the Broad line Seyfert galaxies. In our analysis, the H emission line is found to be asymmetric in few of the galaxies with more number of Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NlSy1) galaxies showing blue asymmetries i.e. traces of outflowing gas as compared to the Broad-line Seyfert 1 (BlSy1) galaxies. This behaviour may be explained by the higher iron content present in the emission line regions of NlSy1 galaxies.},

abstract = {Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are energetic astrophysical sources powered by accretion onto supermassive black holes in galaxies, and present unique observational signatures that cover the full electromagnetic spectrum over more than twenty orders of magnitude in frequency. The rich phenomenology of AGN has resulted in a large number of different "flavours" in the literature that now comprise a complex and confusing AGN "zoo". It is increasingly clear that these classifications are only partially related to intrinsic differences between AGN, and primarily reflect variations in a relatively small number of astrophysical parameters as well the method by which each class of AGN is selected. Taken together, observations in different electromagnetic bands as well as variations over time provide complementary windows on the physics of different sub-structures in the AGN. In this review, we present an overview of AGN multi-wavelength properties with the aim of painting their "big picture" through observations in each electromagnetic band from radio to gamma-rays as well as AGN variability. We address what we can learn from each observational method, the impact of selection effects, the physics behind the emission at each wavelength, and the potential for future studies. To conclude we use these observations to piece together the basic architecture of AGN, discuss our current understanding of unification models, and highlight some open questions that present opportunities for future observational and theoretical progress.},

We report significant time delays between the continuum and the CIV 1549 emission line in 52 quasars, with an estimated false-positive detection rate of 10{\%}. Our analysis of marginal lag measurements indicates that there are on the order of 100 additional lags that should be recoverable by adding more years of data from the program. We use our measurements to calculate black-hole masses and fit an updated CIV radius-luminosity relationship. Our results significantly increase the sample of quasars with CIV RM results, with the quasars spanning two orders of magnitude in luminosity toward the high-luminosity end of the CIV radius-luminosity relation. In addition, these quasars are located at among the highest redshifts (z{\~{}}1.4-2.8) of quasars with black hole masses measured with reverberation mapping.

We introduce a new quantitative recipe to measure {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm line{\}}{\$} that is reproducible, less susceptible to noise and blending in the wings, and scales with the intrinsic width of the line. We compare the four definitions of line width (FWHM and {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm line{\}}{\$} in mean and rms spectra, respectively) for each of the three broad lines and among different lines. There are strong correlations among different width definitions for each line, providing justification for using the line width measured in single-epoch spectroscopy as a virial velocity indicator. There are also strong correlations among different lines, suggesting alternative lines to H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} can be used to estimate virial BH masses. We further investigate the correlations between virial BH masses using different line width definitions and the stellar velocity dispersion of the host galaxies, and the dependence of line shape (characterized by the ratio FWHM/{\$}\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm line{\}}{\$}) on physical properties of the quasar. Our results provide further evidence that FWHM is more sensitive to the orientation of a flattened BLR geometry than {\$}\backslashsigma{\_}{\{}\backslashrm line{\}}{\$}, but the overall comparison between the virial BH mass and host stellar velocity dispersion does not provide conclusive evidence that one particular width definition is significantly better than the others.},

abstract = {The primary X-ray emission from AGN, described by a power law, irradiates the accretion disc producing reflection features in the spectrum. The reflection features arising from the inner regions of the disc can be significantly modified by the relativistic effects near the black hole. We investigate the relationship between the relativistic reflection fraction Rf, defined as the ratio of the coronal intensity that illuminates the accretion disc to the coronal intensity observed directly, and the hard X-ray photon index $\Gamma$ of a NuSTAR sample of Seyfert 1 galaxies. The X-ray spectra are modelled using relxill code which helps to directly obtain the reflection fraction of a relativistically smeared reflection component. The parameter Rf depends on the amount of Comptonised X-ray emission intercepted by the inner accretion disc. We found a positive correlation between $\Gamma$ and Rf in our sample. Seed photons from a larger area of an accretion disc entering the corona will result in increased cooling of the coronal plasma, giving rise to steeper X-ray spectrum. The corona irradiating the larger area of the disc will result in higher reflection fraction. Thus, the observed Rf − $\Gamma$ relation is most likely related to the variations in the disc-corona geometry of AGN.},

abstract = {Accretion flows toward black holes can be of a quite different nature, described as an optically thick cool gas flow in a disk for high accretion rates or as a hot coronal optically thin gas flow for low accretion rates, possibly affected by outflowing gas. The detection of broad iron emission lines in active galactic nuclei (AGN) indicates the coexistence of corona and disk. The appearance and relative strength of such flows essentially depends on their interaction. Liu et al. suggested that condensation of gas from the corona to the disk allows to understand accretion flows of comparable strength of emission. Matter inflow due to gravitational capture of gas is important for the condensation process. We discuss observational features predicted by the model. Data from simultaneous observations of AGN with {\{}$\backslash$it {\{}Swift's{\}}{\}} X-ray and UV-optical telescopes are compared with the theoretical predictions. The frequent detection of broad iron K{\$}\backslashalpha{\$} emission lines and the dependence of the emitted spectra on the Eddington ratio, described by the values of the photon index {\$}\backslashGamma{\$} and the two-point spectral index {\$}\backslashalpha{\_}{\{}\backslashrm{\{}ox{\}}{\}}{\$} are in approximate agreement with the predictions of the condensation model; the latter, however, with a large scatter. The model further yields a coronal emission concentrated in a narrow inner region as is also deduced from the analysis of emissivity profiles. The accretion flows in bright AGN could be described by the accretion of stellar wind or interstellar medium and its condensation into a thin disk.},

abstract = {Reverberation mapping (RM) is one of the most efficient ways to investigate the broad-line region around the central supermassive black holes of active galactic nuclei (AGNs). A common way of performing the RM is to perform a long term spectroscopic monitoring of AGNs, but the spectroscopic monitoring campaign of a large number of AGNs requires an extensive amount of observing time of medium to large size telescopes. As an alternative way, we present the results of photometric RM with medium-band photometry. As the widths of medium-band filters match well with the widths of AGN broad emission lines, the medium-band observation with small telescopes can be a cost-effective way to perform RM. We monitored five nearby AGNs with available spectroscopic RM results showing days to weeks scale variability. Observations were performed for {\~{}}3 months with an average of 3 days cadence using three medium-band filters on a 0.43 m telescope. The time lags between the continuum and the H-alpha emission line light curves are calculated using the JAVELIN software and the discrete correlation function. We find time lags of 1.5-15.9 days for these AGNs, which are consistent with the time lags derived from previous spectroscopic RM measurements. This result demonstrates that even a 0.5 m class telescope can perform RM with medium-bands. Furthermore, we show that RM for tens of thousands AGNs is possible with a dedicated 1 m class telescope.},

abstract = {We present dynamical modeling of the broad line region (BLR) in the Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 50 using reverberation mapping data taken as part of the Lick AGN Monitoring Project (LAMP) 2011. We model the reverberation mapping data directly, constraining the geometry and kinematics of the BLR, as well as deriving a black hole mass estimate that does not depend on a normalizing factor or virial coefficient. We find that the geometry of the BLR in Mrk 50 is a nearly face-on thick disk, with a mean radius of 9.6(+1.2,-0.9) light days, a width of the BLR of 6.9(+1.2,-1.1) light days, and a disk opening angle of 25$\backslash$pm10 degrees above the plane. We also constrain the inclination angle to be 9(+7,-5) degrees, close to face-on. Finally, the black hole mass of Mrk 50 is inferred to be log10(M(BH)/Msun) = 7.57(+0.44,-0.27). By comparison to the virial black hole mass estimate from traditional reverberation mapping analysis, we find the normalizing constant (virial coefficient) to be log10(f) = 0.78(+0.44,-0.27), consistent with the commonly adopted mean value of 0.74 based on aligning the M(BH)-{\{}$\backslash$sigma{\}}* relation for AGN and quiescent galaxies. While our dynamical model includes the possibility of a net inflow or outflow in the BLR, we cannot distinguish between these two scenarios.},

The light curves have nearly daily cadence from 2014 January to July in nine filters ($\backslash$emph{\{}BVRI{\}} and $\backslash$emph{\{}ugriz{\}}). Combined with ultraviolet data from the $\backslash$emph{\{}Hubble Space Telescope{\}} and $\backslash$emph{\{}Swift{\}}, we confirm significant time delays between the continuum bands as a function of wavelength, extending the wavelength coverage from 1158$\backslash$,$\backslash$AA$\backslash$ to the {\$}z{\$} band ({\$}\backslashsim\backslash!9160{\$}$\backslash$,$\backslash$AA). We find that the lags at wavelengths longer than the {\{}$\backslash$it V{\}} band are equal to or greater than the lags of high-ionization-state emission lines (such as He$\backslash$,{\{}$\backslash$sc ii{\}}$\backslash$,{\$}\backslashlambda 1640{\$} and {\$}\backslashlambda 4686{\$}), suggesting that the continuum-emitting source is of a physical size comparable to the inner broad-line region (BLR). The trend of lag with wavelength is broadly consistent with the prediction for continuum reprocessing by an accretion disk with {\$}\backslashtau \backslashpropto \backslashlambda{\^{}}{\{}4/3{\}}{\$}. However, the lags also imply a disk radius that is 3 times larger than the prediction from standard thin-disk theory, assuming that the bolometric luminosity is 10$\backslash${\%} of the Eddington luminosity ({\$}L = 0.1L{\_}{\{}\backslashrm Edd{\}}{\$}). Using optical spectra from the Large Binocular Telescope, we estimate the bias of the interband continuum lags due to BLR emission observed in the filters. We find that the bias for filters with high levels of BLR contamination ({\$}\backslashsim\backslash! 20\backslash{\%}{\$}) can be important for the shortest continuum lags, and likely has a significant impact on the {\{}$\backslash$it u{\}} and {\{}$\backslash$it U{\}} bands owing to Balmer continuum emission.},

@article{Edelson2015,
abstract = {Recent intensive Swift monitoring of the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 5548 yielded 282 usable epochs over 125 days across six UV/optical bands and the X-rays. This is the densest extended AGN UV/optical continuum sampling ever obtained, with a mean sampling rate {\textless}0.5 day. Approximately daily HST UV sampling was also obtained. The UV/optical light curves show strong correlations (r{\_}max = 0.57 - 0.90) and the clearest measurement to date of interband lags. These lags are well-fit by a $\backslash$tau propto $\backslash$lambda{\^{}}4/3 wavelength dependence, with a normalization that indicates an unexpectedly large disk radius of 0.35 +/- 0.05 lt-day at 1367 A, assuming a simple face-on model. The U-band shows a marginally larger lag than expected from the fit and surrounding bands, which could be due to Balmer continuum emission from the broad-line region as suggested by Korista and Goad. The UV/X-ray correlation is weaker (r{\_}max {\textless} 0.45) and less consistent over time. This indicates that while Swift is beginning to measure UV/optical lags in general agreement with accretion disk theory (although the derived size is larger than predicted), the relationship with X-ray variability is less well understood. Combining this accretion disk size estimate with those from quasar microlensing studies suggests that AGN disk sizes scale approximately linearly with central black hole mass over a wide range of masses.},

abstract = {We show recent detections of inter-band continuum lags in three AGN (NGC 5548, NGC 2617, and MCG+08-11-011), which provide new constraints on the temperature profiles and absolute sizes of the accretion disks. We find lags larger than would be predicted for standard geometrically thin, optically thick accretion disks by factors of 2.3–3.3. For NGC 5548, the data span UV through optical/near-IR wavelengths, and we are able to discern a steeper temperature profile than the T {\~{}} R−3/4 expected for a standard thin disk. Using a physical model, we are also able to estimate the inclinations of the disks for two objects. These results are similar to those found from gravitational microlensing of strongly lensed quasars, and provide a complementary approach for investigating the accretion disk structure in local, low luminosity AGN.},

abstract = {The evidence is reviewed that the Broad Line Region (BLR) probably has two distinct components located at about the same distance from the central black hole. One component, BLR II, is optically-thick, low-ionization emission at least some of which arises from a disc and the other, BLR I, is probably optically-thin emission from a more spherically symmetric halo or atmosphere. The high Fe II/H$\beta$ ratios seen in Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies (NLS1s) are not due to strong Fe II emission, as is commonly thought, but to unusually weak Balmer emission, probably caused by higher densities. NLS1s probably differ from non-NLS1s because of the higher density of gas near the black hole. This produces a higher accretion rate, a denser BLR, and a view of the central regions that is more face-on.},

Our quasar sample covers a redshift range of 0.1{\textless}z{\textless}4.5 and is flux-limited to i{\_}PSF{\textless}21.7 without any other cuts on quasar properties. The main sample characterization includes: 1) spectral measurements of the continuum and broad emission lines for individual objects from the coadded first-season spectroscopy in 2014; 2) identification of broad and narrow absorption lines in the spectra; 3) optical variability properties for continuum and broad lines from multi-epoch spectroscopy. We provide improved systemic redshift estimates for all quasars, and demonstrate the effects of signal-to-noise ratio on the spectral measurements. We compile measured properties for all 849 quasars along with supplemental multi-wavelength data for subsets of our sample from other surveys. The SDSS-RM sample probes a diverse range in quasar properties, and shows well detected continuum and broad-line variability for many objects from first-season monitoring data. The compiled properties serve as the benchmark for follow-up work based on SDSS-RM data. The spectral fitting tools are made public along with this work.},

We are able to measure statistically significant lags for Ly{\_}alpha (11 objects), SiIV (5 objects), CIV (11 objects), and CIII] (2 objects). Using our results and previous lag determinations taken from the literature, we present an updated CIV radius--luminosity relation and provide for the first time radius--luminosity relations for Ly{\_}alpha, SiIV and CIII]. While in all cases the slope of the correlations are statistically significant, the zero points are poorly constrained because of the lack of data at the low luminosity end. We find that the emissivity weighted distance from the central source of the Ly{\_}alpha, SiIV and CIII] line emitting regions are all similar, which corresponds to about half that of the H{\_}beta region. We also find that 3/17 of our sources show an unexpected behavior in some emission lines, two in the Ly{\_}alpha light curve and one in the SiIV light curve, in that they do not seem to follow the variability of the UV continuum. Finally, we compute RM black hole masses for those quasars with highly significant lag measurements and compare them with CIV single--epoch (SE) mass determinations. We find that the RM-based black hole mass determinations seem smaller than those found using SE calibrations.},

abstract = {KA1858+4850 is a narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy at redshift 0.078 and is among the brightest active galaxies monitored by the Kepler mission. We have carried out a reverberation mapping campaign designed to measure the broad-line region size and estimate the mass of the black hole in this galaxy. We obtained 74 epochs of spectroscopic data using the Kast Spectrograph at the Lick 3-m telescope from February to November of 2012, and obtained complementary V-band images from five other ground-based telescopes. We measured the H-beta light curve lag with respect to the V-band continuum light curve using both cross-correlation techniques (CCF) and continuum light curve variability modeling with the JAVELIN method, and found rest-frame lags of lag{\_}CCF = 13.53 (+2.03, -2.32) days and lag{\_}JAVELIN = 13.15 (+1.08, -1.00) days. The H-beta root-mean-square line profile has a width of sigma{\_}line = 770 +/- 49 km/s. Combining these two results and assuming a virial scale factor of f = 5.13, we obtained a virial estimate of M{\_}BH = 8.06 (+1.59, -1.72) x 10{\^{}}6 M{\_}sun for the mass of the central black hole and an Eddington ratio of L/L{\_}Edd {\~{}} 0.2. We also obtained consistent but slightly shorter emission-line lags with respect to the Kepler light curve. Thanks to the Kepler mission, the light curve of KA1858+4850 has among the highest cadences and signal-to-noise ratios ever measured for an active galactic nucleus; thus, our black hole mass measurement will serve as a reference point for relations between black hole mass and continuum variability characteristics in active galactic nuclei.},

the active galactic nucleus (AGN) continuum, and measurements of
the broad H{\{}$\backslash$ensuremath{\{}$\backslash$beta{\}}{\}} line widths in mean and rms

We find that (i) the distribution of the intrinsic broad-line Halpha/Hbeta ratio can be well described by log-Gaussian, with a peak at Halpha/Hbeta=3.06 and a standard deviation of about 0.03 dex only; (ii) the Balmer decrement does not correlate with AGN properties such as luminosity, accretion rate, and continuum slope, etc.; (iii) on average, the Balmer decrements are found to be only slightly larger in radio-loud sources (3.37) and sources having double-peaked emission-line profiles (3.27) compared to the rest of the sample. We therefore suggest that the broad-line Halpha/Hbeta ratio can be used as a good indicator for dust extinction in the AGN broad-line region; this is especially true for radio-quiet AGN with regular emission-line profiles, which constitute the vast majority of the AGN population.},

abstract = {Reverberation mapping is now a well-established technique for investigating spatially-unresolved structures in the nuclei of distant galaxies with actively-accreting supermassive black holes. Structural parameters for the broad emission-line region, with angular sizes of microarcseconds, can be constrained through the substitution of time resolution for spatial resolution. Many reverberation experiments over the last 30 years have led to a practical understanding of the requirements necessary for a successful program. With reverberation measurements now in hand for 60 active galaxies, and more on the horizon, we are able to directly constrain black hole masses, derive scaling relationships that allow large numbers of black hole mass estimates throughout the observable Universe, and begin investigating the detailed geometry and kinematics of the broad line region. Reverberation mapping is therefore one of the few techniques available that will allow a deeper understanding of the physical mechanisms involved in AGN feeding and feedback at very small scales, as well as constraints on the growth and evolution of black holes across cosmic time. In this contribution, I will briefly review the background, implementation, and major results derived from this high angular resolution technique.},

abstract = {We disentangle X-ray disk reflection from complex line-of-sight absorption in the nearby Seyfert NGC 4151, using a suite of Suzaku, NuSTAR, and XMM-Newton observations. Extending upon earlier published work, we pursue a physically motivated model using the latest angle-resolved version of the lamp-post geometry reflection model relxillCp{\_}lp together with a Comptonization continuum. We use the long-look simultaneous Suzaku/NuSTAR observation to develop a baseline model wherein we model reflected emission as a combination of lamp-post components at the heights of 1.2 and 15.0 gravitational radii. We argue for a vertically extended corona as opposed to two compact and distinct primary sources. We find two neutral absorbers (one full-covering and one partial-covering), an ionized absorber ({\$}\backslashlog \backslashxi = 2.8{\$}), and a highly-ionized ultra-fast outflow, which have all been reported previously. All analyzed spectra are well described by this baseline model. The bulk of the spectral variability between 1 keV and 6 keV can be accounted for by changes in the column density of both neutral absorbers, which appear to be degenerate and inversely correlated with the variable hard continuum component flux. We track variability in absorption on both short (2 d) and long ({\$}\backslashsim{\$}1 yr) timescales; the observed evolution is either consistent with changes in the absorber structure (clumpy absorber at distances ranging from the broad line region (BLR) to the inner torus or a dusty radiatively driven wind) or a geometrically stable neutral absorber that becomes increasingly ionized at a rising flux level. The soft X-rays below 1 keV are dominated by photoionized emission from extended gas that may act as a warm mirror for the nuclear radiation.},

abstract = {This review describes recent developments related to the unified model of active galactic nuclei (AGN). It focuses on new ideas about the origin and properties of the central obscurer (torus), and the connection with its surrounding. The review does not address radio unification. AGN tori must be clumpy but the uncertainties about their properties are still large. Todays most promising models involve disk winds of various types and hydrodynamical simulations that link the large scale galactic disk to the inner accretion flow. IR studies greatly improved the understanding of the spectral energy distribution of AGNs but they are hindered by various selection effects. X-ray samples are more complete. A basic relationship which is still unexplained is the dependence of the torus covering factor on luminosity. There is also much confusion regarding "real type-II AGNs" that do not fit into a simple unification scheme. The most impressive recent results are due to IR interferometry, which is not in accord with most torus models, and the accurate mapping of central ionization cones. AGN unification may not apply to merging systems and is possibly restricted to secularly evolving galaxies.},

abstract = {We have recently completed a 64-night spectroscopic monitoring campaign at the Lick Observatory 3-m Shane telescope with the aim of measuring the masses of the black holes in 12 nearby (z {\textless} 0.05) Seyfert 1 galaxies with expected masses in the range ∼ 10 6 –10 7 M and also the well-studied nearby active galactic nucleus (AGN) NGC 5548. Nine of the objects in the sample (including NGC 5548) showed optical variability of sufficient strength during the monitoring campaign to allow for a time lag to be measured between the continuum fluctuations and the response to these fluctuations in the broad H$\beta$ emission. We present here the light curves for all the objects in this sample and the subsequent H$\beta$ time lags for the nine objects where these measurements were possible. The H$\beta$ lag time is directly related to the size of the broad-line region (BLR) in AGNs, and by combining the H$\beta$ lag time with the measured width of the H$\beta$ emission line in the variable part of the spectrum, we determine the virial mass of the central supermassive black hole in these nine AGNs. The absolute calibration of the black hole masses is based on the normalization derived by Onken et al., which brings the masses determined by reverberation mapping into agreement with the local M BH –$\sigma$ relationship for quiescent galaxies. We also examine the time lag response as a function of velocity across the H$\beta$ line profile for six of the AGNs. The analysis of four leads to rather ambiguous results with relatively flat time lags as a function of velocity. However, SBS 1116+583A exhibits a symmetric time lag response around the line center reminiscent of simple models for circularly orbiting BLR clouds, and Arp 151 shows an asymmetric profile that is most easily explained by a simple gravitational infall model. Further investigation will be necessary to fully understand the constraints placed on the physical models of the BLR by the velocity-resolved response in these objects.},

Standard accretion disk is a key element in all relatively bright active galaxies like Seyferts and quasars, although it is not present in very low luminosity sources, like Sgr A*. However, the standard disk does not explain the broad band spectrum, so the disk has to be supplemented with a number of additional components, and our deeper understanding of these components is still far from being complete. These additional elements are: compact hard X-ray corona, inner hot flow, warm corona, disk wind and the Broad Line Region, and finally dusty/molecular torus. All these elements seem to be needed in various proportions, depending predominantly on the Eddington ratio of a given source. These elements also interact with each other which is not yet fully taken into account.},

abstract = {Velocity-resolved reverberation mapping suggests that the broad-line regions (BLRs) of AGNs can have significant net inflow. We use the STOKES radiative transfer code to show that electron and Rayleigh scattering off the BLR and torus naturally explains the blueshifted profiles of high-ionization lines and the ionization dependence of the blueshifts. This result is insensitive to the geometry of the scattering region. If correct, this model resolves the long-standing conflict between the absence of outflow implied by velocity-resolved reverberation mapping and the need for outflow if the blueshifting is the result of obscuration. The accretion rate implied by the inflow is sufficient to power the AGN. We suggest that the BLR is part of the outer accretion disk and that similar MHD processes are operating. In the scattering model the blueshifting is proportional to the accretion rate so high-accretion-rate AGNs will show greater high-ionization line blueshifts as is observed. Scattering can lead to systematically too high black hole mass estimates from the C IV line. We note many similarities between narrow-line region (NLR) and BLR blueshiftings, and suggest that NLR blueshiftings have a similar explanation. Our model explains the higher blueshifts of broad absorption line QSOs if they are more highly inclined. Rayleigh scattering from the BLR and torus could be more important in the UV than electron scattering for predominantly neutral material around AGNs. The importance of Rayleigh scattering versus electron scattering can be assessed by comparing line profiles at different wavelengths arising from the same emission-line region.},

We demonstrate the benefits of the extended light curves in three cases: (1) lags that are too long to be detected by the shorter-duration data but can be detected with the extended data; (2) lags that are recovered by the extended light curves but missed in the shorter-duration data due to insufficient light curve quality; and (3) lags for different broad line species in the same object. These examples demonstrate the importance of long-term monitoring for reverberation mapping to detect lags for luminous quasars at high-redshift, and the expected performance of the final dataset from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping project that will have 11-year photometric and 7-year spectroscopic baselines.},

abstract = {Studying the relationships among quasar spectral features is essential to unveil the origins of the emission lines and the quasars' physical processes. Principal component analysis (PCA) is a powerful tool to investigate correlations between variables. Here, we present the results of PCA on the spectra of low-redshift SDSS quasars. The rest-frame wavelength range studied is 4000 – 5500 ˚A, involving some typical features of quasar spectra, such as H$\beta$, [O III] and Fe II emission lines. The first principal compo- nent is the anti-correlation between [O III] and Fe II, the well-known eigenvector one (EV1). The next six principal components also show clear (anti-)correlations between line strengths and/or velocity widths of various features, which agree well with measured spectral properties. By comparing the weights of these principal components with other quasar properties, we can identify their underlying drivers. We find that the second principal component represents spectral slope, and can quantify quasar host fraction, intrinsic slope and reddening well. The third component exhibits the velocity width variation of H$\beta$, and may be a proxy for orientation. In addition, we calculate the fractional-contribution spectra to investigate which com- ponents dominate the variance at individual wavelength ranges. Our results also indicate that the optical Fe II emission may have distinct origins.},

In a sample of 27 quasars with a median of 58 spectral epochs per quasar, we have identified 15 quasars ({\$}55{\^{}}{\{}+18{\}}{\_}{\{}-14{\}}{\$}{\%}), 19 of 37 CIV BAL troughs ({\$}51{\^{}}{\{}+15{\}}{\_}{\{}-12{\}}{\$}{\%}), and 54 of 1460 epoch pairs ({\$}3.7 \backslashpm 0.5{\$}{\%}) that exhibit significant CIV BAL equivalent-width variability on timescales of less than 10 days in the quasar rest frame. These frequencies indicate that such variability is common among quasars and BALs, though somewhat rare among epoch pairs. Thus, models describing BALs and their behavior must account for variability on timescales down to less than a day in the quasar rest frame. We also examine a variety of spectral characteristics and find that in some cases, BAL variability is best described by ionization-state changes, while other cases are more consistent with changes in covering fraction or column density. We adopt a simple model to constrain the density and radial distance of two outflows appearing to vary by ionization-state changes, yielding outflow density lower limits consistent with previous work.},

abstract = {The aim of this short paper is to motivate and encourage research in the field of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). Here we summarize the main open questions concerning the central engine. Is the central black hole rapidly spinning and can we prove this? What is the dominant accretion mechanism in AGN? Why do some AGN form jets while others don't and how do the jets originate? What keeps jets collimated out to distances of 100 kpc? Is the emission of blazars dominated rather by synchrotron self-Compton or by external Compton processes? Which parameters are important in the unified model? We outline the status of related research, formulate the questions and try to hint at research projects able to tackle these fundamental topics. Deep surveys, polarization measurements, improved models, faster and more accurate simulations as well as bridging the gap in the MeV range can be part of the tools to bring us closer to an understanding of AGN.},

abstract = {Active galactic nuclei (AGN) vary in their brightness across all wavelengths. Moreover, longer wavelength ultraviolet-optical continuum light curves appear to be delayed with respect to shorter wavelength light curves. A simple way to model these delays is by assuming thermal reprocessing of a variable point source (a lamp post) by a blackbody accretion disc. We introduce a new method, CREAM (Continuum REprocessed AGN Markov Chain Monte Carlo), that models continuum variations using this lamp post model. The disc light curves lag the lamp post emission with a time delay distribution sensitive to the disc temperature-radius profile and inclination. We test CREAM's ability to recover both inclination and product of black hole mass and accretion rate M ˙ M, and show that the code is also able to infer the shape of the driving light curve. CREAM is applied to synthetic light curves expected from 1000 s exposures of a 17th magnitude AGN with a 2-m telescope in Sloan g and i bands with Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of 500-900 depending on the filter and lunar phase. We also test CREAM on poorer quality g and i light curves with SNR = 100. We find in the high-SNR case that CREAM can recover the accretion disc inclination to within an uncertainty of 5 • and an M ˙ M to within 0.04 dex.},

Using the Wise Observatory's 1 m telescope equipped with the Sloan Digital Sky Survey g', r', and i' broadband filters, we monitored NGC 4395 for nine consecutive nights and obtained three light curves each with over 250 data points. The g' and r' bands include time variable contributions from H$\beta$ and H$\alpha$, respectively, plus continuum. The i' band is free of broad lines and covers exclusively continuum. We show that by looking for a peak in the difference between the cross-correlation and the auto-correlation functions for all combinations of filters, we can get a reliable estimate of the time lag necessary to compute M BH. We measure the time lag for H$\alpha$ to be 3.6 ± 0.8 hr, comparable to previous studies using the line-resolved spectroscopic RM method. We argue that this lag implies a black hole mass of M BH = (4.9 ± 2.6) × 104 M {\&}sun;.},

abstract = {Quasars have been proposed as a new class of standard candles analogous to Supernovae, as their large redshift range and high luminosities make them excellent candidates. Reverberation mapping (RM) method enables to estimate the distance to the source from the time delay measurement of the emission lines with respect to the continuum, since the time delay depends on the absolute luminosity of the source. This radius-luminosity (RL) relation exhibits a low scatter and it was thus proposed for the cosmological purposes. However, in the recent years the increase in the studied sample, and in particular the inclusion of highly accreting QSO has increased the dispersion in the RL relation, with many objects showing time delays shorter than the expected. Using H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} RM measurements for 117 sources with {\$}0.2{\textless}z{\textless}0.9{\$} and {\$}41.5{\textless}\backslashmathrm{\{}log{\}}{\~{}}L{\_}{\{}5100{\}}{\textless}45.9{\$}, we find a correction for the time delay based on the dimensionless accretion rate considering the virial factor anti-correlated with the FWHM of H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$}. This correction decreases the scattering in the accretion parameters compared with typical value used, which is directly reflected by suppressing the RL relation dispersion. We also confirm the anti-correlation between the excess of variability and the accretion parameters. With this correction we are able to build the Hubble diagram and estimate the cosmological constants {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}m{\$} and {\$}\backslashOmega{\_}\backslashLambda{\$}, which are consistent with standard cosmological model at 2{\$}\backslashsigma{\$} confidence level. Therefore, RM results can be used to constrain cosmological models in the future.},

We focus on simulated light curves from random realizations of the light curves of five intensively monitored AGNs. Both methods generally work well even in the presence of systematic errors, although javelin generally provides better error estimates. Poorly estimated light-curve uncertainties have less effect on the ICCF method because, unlike javelin , it does not explicitly assume Gaussian statistics. Neither method is sensitive to changes in the stochastic process driving the continuum or the transfer function relating the line light curve to the continuum. The only systematic error we considered that causes significant problems is if the line light curve is not a smoothed and shifted version of the continuum light curve but instead contains some additional sources of variability.},

abstract = {Broad emission lines in quasars enable us to "resolve" structure and kinematics of the broad-line emitting region (BLR) thought to involve an accretion disk feeding a supermassive black hole. Interpretation of broad line measures within the 4DE1 formalism simplifies the apparent confusion among such data by contrasting and unifying properties of so-called high and low accreting Population A and B sources. H$\beta$ serves as an estimator of black hole mass, Eddington ratio and source rest frame; the latter being a valuable input for Civ$\lambda$1549 studies which allow us to isolate the blueshifted wind component. Optical and HST-UV spectra yield H$\beta$ and Civ$\lambda$1549 spectra for low-luminosity sources while VLT-ISAAC and FORS and TNG-LRS provide spectra for high-luminosity sources. New high-S/N data for Civ in high-luminosity quasars are presented here for comparison with the other previously published data. Comparison of H$\beta$ and Civ$\lambda$1549 profile widths/shifts indicates that much of the emission from the two lines arise in regions with different structure and kinematics. Covering a wide range of luminosity and redshift shows evidence for a correlation between Civ$\lambda$1549 blueshift and source Eddington ratio, with a weaker trend with source luminosity (similar amplitude outflows are seen over four of the five dex luminosity ranges in our combined samples). At low luminosity (z ≲ 0.7) only Population A sources show evidence for a significant outflow while at high luminosity the outflow signature begins to appear in Population B quasars as well.},

abstract = {We investigate the performance of different methodologies that measure the time lag between broad-line and continuum variations in reverberation mapping data using simulated light curves that probe a range of cadence, time baseline, and signal-to-noise ratio in the flux measurements. We compare three widely-adopted lag measuring methods: the Interpolated Cross-Correlation Function (ICCF), the z-transformed Discrete Correlation Function (ZDCF) and the MCMC code JAVELIN, for mock data with qualities typical of multi-object spectroscopic reverberation mapping (MOS-RM) surveys that simultaneously monitor hundreds of quasars. We quantify the overall lag detection efficiency, the rate of false detections, and the quality of lag measurements for each of these methods and under different survey designs (e.g., observing cadence and depth) using mock quasar light curves. Overall JAVELIN and ICCF outperform ZDCF in essentially all tests performed. Compared with ICCF, JAVELIN produces higher quality lag measurements, is capable of measuring more lags with timescales shorter than the observing cadence, is less susceptible to seasonal gaps and S/N degradation in the light curves, and produces more accurate lag uncertainties. We measure the Hbeta broad-line region size-luminosity (R-L) relation with each method using the simulated light curves to assess the impact of selection effects of the design of MOS-RM surveys. The slope of the R-L relation measured by JAVELIN is the least biased among the three methods, and is consistent across different survey designs. These results demonstrate a clear preference for JAVELIN over the other two non-parametric methods for MOS-RM programs, particularly in the regime of limited light curve quality as expected from most MOS-RM programs.},

abstract = {In the standard AGN reverberation-mapping model variations in broad-line region (BLR) fluxes are predicted from optical continuum variability (taken as a proxy for variations in the ionizing continuum) convolved with an impulse function that depends on the geometry of the emitting and reprocessing regions. However, it has long been known that BLR variability can deviate from these predictions. We analyze extensive long-term H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} and continuum monitoring of NGC 5548 and a large sample of high-quality H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} light curves of other AGNs to investigate the frequency and characteristics of anomalous responses of the BLR. Anomalies are very common and probably occur in every object. Onsets can be on a timescale only slightly longer than the light-crossing time and durations are of the order of the characteristic timescale of variability of the optical continuum to several times longer. Anomalies are larger when NGC 5548 is in a low state, but otherwise there is no correlation with continuum variability. There is abundant evidence for the optical continuum of AGNs varying independently of the higher-energy continua and this is sufficient to explain the anomalous responses. There are good reasons for believing that the frequent lack of correlation between different spectral regions is due to anisotropic and non-axisymmetric emission. Rapid changes in line profiles and velocity-dependent lags are consistent with this. Motion of compact absorbing clouds across the line of sight is another possible cause of anomalies. The prevalence of anomalies needs to be taken into account when planning reverberation-mapping campaigns.},

abstract = {We present a general method to analyze reverberation mapping data that provides both estimates for the black hole mass and for the geometry and dynamics of the broad line region (BLR) in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Our method directly infers the spatial and velocity distribution of the BLR from the data, allowing us to easily derive a velocity-resolved transfer function and allowing for a self-consistent estimate of the black hole mass without a virial coefficient. We obtain estimates and reasonable uncertainties of the BLR model parameters by implementing a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm using the formalism of Bayesian probability theory. We use Gaussian Processes to interpolate the the continuum light curve data and create mock light curves that can be fitted to the data. We test our method by creating simulated reverberation mapping data-sets with known true parameter values and by trying to recover these parameter values using our models. We are able to recover the parameters with realistic uncertainties that depend upon the variability of the AGN and the quality of the reverberation mapping campaign. With a geometry model we can recover the mean radius of the BLR to within {\~{}}0.1dex random uncertainty for simulated data with an integrated line flux uncertainty of 1.5{\%}, while with a dynamical model we can recover the black hole mass and the mean radius to within {\~{}}0.05dex random uncertainty, for simulated data with a line profile average signal to noise ratio of 4 per spectral pixel. These uncertainties do not include modeling errors, which are likely to be present in the analysis of real data, and should therefore be considered as lower limits to the accuracy of the method.},

abstract = {We present a new catalog of narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLSy1) galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 12 (SDSS DR12). This was obtained by a systematic analysis through modeling of the continuum and emission lines of the spectra of all the 68,859 SDSS DR12 objects that are classified as "QSO" by the SDSS spectroscopic pipeline with z {\textless} 0.8 and a median signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) {\textgreater} 2 per pixel. This catalog contains a total of 11,101 objects, which is about 5 times larger than the previously known NLSy1 galaxies. Their monochromatic continuum luminosity at 5100 A is found to be strongly correlated with H-beta, H-alpha, and [O III] emission line luminosities. The optical Fe II strength in NLSy1 galaxies is about two times larger than the broad- line Seyfert 1 (BLSy1) galaxies. About 5{\%} of the catalog sources are detected in the FIRST survey. The Eddington ratio (XEdd) of NLSy1 galaxies has an average of log XEdd of -0.34, much higher than -1.03 found for BLSy1 galaxies. Their black hole masses (MBH) have an average of log MBH of 6.9 Msun, which is less than BLSy1 galaxies, which have an average of log MBH of 8.0 Msun. The MBH of NLSy1 galaxies is found to be correlated with their host galaxy velocity dispersion. Our analysis suggests that geometrical effects playing an important role in defining NLSy1 galaxies and their MBH deficit is perhaps due to their lower inclination compared to BLSy1 galaxies.},

The proposed precoding schemes are capable of estimating interference channels between CR and primary networks, and incorporating the interference from the primary to the CR system into CR precoding via a novel sensing approach. Then, the CR performance and resulting interference of the proposed precoding schemes are analyzed and evaluated. By fully projecting the CR transmission onto a null space of the interference channels, the FP-based precoding scheme can effectively avoid interfering the primary system with boosted CR throughput. While, the PP-based scheme is able to further improve the CR throughput by partially projecting its transmission onto the null space. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In the last decade, a combination of high sensitivity, high spatial resolution observations and of coordinated multi-wavelength surveys has revolutionized our view of extra-galactic black hole (BH) astrophysics. We now know that supermassive black holes reside in the nuclei of almost every galaxy, grow over cosmological times by accreting matter, interact and merge with each other, and in the process liberate enormous amounts of energy that influence dramatically the evolution of the surrounding gas and stars, providing a powerful self-regulatory mechanism for galaxy formation. The different energetic phenomena associated to growing black holes and Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), their cosmological evolution and the observational techniques used to unveil them, are the subject of this chapter. In particular, I will focus my attention on the connection between the theory of high-energy astrophysical processes giving rise to the observed emission in AGN, the observable imprints they leave at different wavelengths, and the methods used to uncover them in a statistically robust way. I will show how such a combined effort of theorists and observers have led us to unveil most of the SMBH growth over a large fraction of the age of the Universe, but that nagging uncertainties remain, preventing us from fully understating the exact role of black holes in the complex process of galaxy and large-scale structure formation, assembly and evolution.},

abstract = {The physical origin of the broad line region in active galactic nuclei is still unclear despite many years of observational studies. The reason is that the region is unresolved, and the reverberation mapping results imply a complex velocity field. We adopt a theory-motivated approach to identify the principal mechanism responsible for this complex phenomenon. We consider the possibility that the role of dust is essential. We assume that the local radiation pressure acting on the dust in the accretion disk atmosphere launches the outflow of material, but higher above the disk the irradiation from the central parts causes dust evaporation and a subsequent fallback. This failed radiatively accelerated dusty outflow is expected to represent the material forming low ionization lines. In this paper we formulate simple analytical equations to describe the cloud motion, including the evaporation phase. The model is fully described just by the basic parameters of black hole mass, accretion rate, black hole spin, and viewing angle. We study how the spectral line generic profiles correspond to this dynamic. We show that the virial factor calculated from our model strongly depends on the black hole mass in the case of enhanced dust opacity, and thus it then correlates with the line width. This could explain why the virial factor measured in galaxies with pseudobulges differs from that obtained from objects with classical bulges, although the trend predicted by the current version of the model is opposite to the observed trend.},

abstract = {We present accretion disk size measurements for 15 luminous quasars at {\$}0.7 \backslashleq z \backslashleq 1.9{\$} derived from {\$}griz{\$} light curves from the Dark Energy Survey. We measure the disk sizes with continuum reverberation mapping using two methods, both of which are derived from the expectation that accretion disks have a radial temperature gradient and the continuum emission at a given radius is well-described by a single blackbody. In the first method we measure the relative lags between the multiband light curves, which provides the relative time lag between shorter and longer wavelength variations. The second method fits the model parameters for the canonical Shakura-Sunyaev thin disk directly rather than solving for the individual time lags between the light curves. Our measurements demonstrate good agreement with the sizes predicted by this model for accretion rates between 0.3-1 times the Eddington rate. These results are also in reasonable agreement with disk size measurements from gravitational microlensing studies of strongly lensed quasars, as well as other photometric reverberation mapping results.},

abstract = {The material surrounding accreting supermassive black holes connects the active galactic nucleus (AGN) with its host galaxy and, besides being responsible for feeding the black hole, provides important information on the feedback that nuclear activity produces on the galaxy. In this Review we summarize our current understanding of the close environment of accreting supermassive black holes obtained from studies of local AGN carried out in the infrared and X-ray band. The structure of this circumnuclear material is complex, clumpy and dynamical, and its covering factor depends on the accretion properties of the AGN. From the infrared point of view, this obscuring material is a transition zone between the broad-and narrow-line region, and at least in some galaxies, it consists of two structures: an equatorial disk/torus and a polar component. In the X-ray regime, the obscuration is produced by multiple absorbers on various spatial scales, mostly associated with the torus and the broad-line region. In the next decade the new generation of infrared and X-ray facilities will greatly contribute to our understanding of the structure and physical properties of nuclear obscuration in AGN. Over the past decades several pieces of observational evidence have shown that supermassive black holes (SMBHs; M BH ∼ 10 6−9.5 M⊙) are found at the center of almost all massive galaxies, and that those SMBHs play an important role in the evolution of their host galaxies 1 during a phase in which they are accreting material and are observed as active galactic nuclei (AGN). Indeed, different modes of AGN feedback are expected to be key processes shaping the environment of SMBHs. In particular , quasar-induced outflows might be capable of regulating black hole and galaxy growth 2. For instance, they are required by semi-analytical models of galaxy formation for quenching star formation in massive galaxies 3. However, directly studying the influence of nuclear activity on galaxy evolution is difficult because of the completely different timescales involved 4, 5. Therefore, to directly probe the AGN-host galaxy connection we need to look at the structure and kinematics of the parsec-scale dust and gas surrounding the accreting SMBHs. AGN radiate across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, from the radio and up to gamma-rays. A large fraction of their emission is produced in the accretion disk and emitted in the optical and ultraviolet (UV) bands. A significant proportion of these optical/UV photons are reprocessed i) by dust located beyond the sublimation radius and re-emitted in the infrared (IR), and ii) by a corona of hot electrons close to the accretion disk that up-scatters them in the X-ray band 6 and illuminates the surrounding material. Thus, studying the IR and X-ray emission and absorption of AGN is key to characterize nuclear regions of AGN.},

abstract = {Broad Emission Lines are the most characteristic features of Active Galaxies, but the mechanism of creating a medium able to emit these intense lines is not quite clear. Observations clearly indicate that the motion of the material is predominantly Keplerian, with traces of inflow and outflow, but this still does not point out whether the lines partially come from the disk surface, or exclusively from the circumnuclear material, and whether this material originates from the disk as a wind, or comes, at least partially, from outside. I review the basic scenarios for the formation of the Broad Line Region (BLR), and the recent progress in modelling the physical conditions in the emitting medium. The current state is the the outer radius of the BLR is fixed by the dust sublimation temperature in the medium exposed to the irradiation from the central source, the inner radius is likely fixed by the dust sublimation temperature in the atmosphere of the non-illuminated accretion disk, and the local cloud density is a universal number fixed by the radiation pressure confinement. The time-dependent aspects of the BLR formation, however, still wait for serious modelling effort matching the quality of the observational data.},

abstract = {We report first results from a large project to measure black hole (BH) mass in high accretion rate active galactic nuclei (AGNs). Such objects may be different from other AGNs in being powered by slim accretion disks and showing saturated accretion luminosities, but both are not yet fully understood. The results are part of a large reverberation mapping (RM) campaign using the 2.4-m Shangri-La telescope at the Yunnan Observatory in China. The goals are to investigate the gas distribution near the BH and the properties of the central accretion disks, to measure BH mass and Eddington ratios, and to test the feasibility of using such objects as a new type of cosmological candles. The paper presents results for three objects, Mrk 335, Mrk 142 and IRAS F12397+3333 with H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} time lags relative to the 5100$\backslash$AA$\backslash$ continuum of {\$}10.6{\^{}}{\{}+1.7{\}}{\_}{\{}-2.9{\}}{\$}, {\$}6.4{\^{}}{\{}+0.8{\}}{\_}{\{}-2.2{\}}{\$} and {\$}11.4{\^{}}{\{}+2.9{\}}{\_}{\{}-1.9{\}}{\$} days, respectively.

Mrk 142 and IRAS F12397+333 (extinction corrected) clearly deviate from the currently known relation between H{\$}\backslashbeta{\$} lag and continuum luminosity. The three Eddington ratios are beyond the values expected in thin accretion disks and two of them are the largest measured so far among objects with RM-based BH masses. We briefly discuss implications for slim disks, BH growth and cosmology.},

abstract = {We analyze a sample of optical light curves for 100 quasars, 70 of which have black hole mass estimates. Our sample is the largest and broadest used yet for modeling quasar variability. The sources in our sample have z {\textless} 2.8, 1042 ≲ $\lambda$L $\lambda$(5100 ) ≲ 10 46, and 106 ≲ M BH/M ⊙ ≲ 1010. We model the light curves as a continuous time stochastic process, providing a natural means of estimating the characteristic timescale and amplitude of quasar variations. We employ a Bayesian approach to estimate the characteristic timescale and amplitude of flux variations; our approach is not affected by biases introduced from discrete sampling effects. We find that the characteristic timescales strongly correlate with black hole mass and luminosity, and are consistent with disk orbital or thermal timescales. In addition, the amplitude of short-timescale variations is significantly anticorrelated with black hole mass and luminosity. We interpret the optical flux fluctuations as resulting from thermal fluctuations that are driven by an underlying stochastic process, such as a turbulent magnetic field. In addition, the intranight variations in optical flux implied by our empirical model are ≲0.02 mag, consistent with current microvariability observations of radio-quiet quasars. Our stochastic model is therefore able to unify both long- and short-timescale optical variations in radio-quiet quasars as resulting from the same underlying process, while radio-loud quasars have an additional variability component that operates on timescales ≲1 day. {\textcopyright} 2009.

The median redshift of our H{\$}\backslashbackslashbeta{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}-detected sample of quasars is 0.53, significantly higher than that of the previous reverberation-mapping sample. We find that in most objects, the time delay of the H{\$}\backslashbackslashalpha{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}} emission is consistent with or slightly longer than that of H{\$}\backslashbackslashbeta{\{}\backslash{\$}{\}}. We measure black hole masses using our measured time delays and line widths for these quasars. These black hole mass measurements are mostly consistent with expectations based on the local M-sigma relationship, and are also consistent with single-epoch black hole mass measurements.

@article{Tadhunter2008,
abstract = {a b s t r a c t In this article I present a summary of AGN classification, followed by a critical review of attempts to understand aspects of the classification in terms of orientation-based unified schemes. Concentrating on radio-loud AGN, I show that the unified schemes based on anisotropy induced both by beaming in rel-ativistic jets and by absorption in dusty torus structures, work well in a broad-brush sense. However, they represent simplifications of a situation that is, in reality, likely to be more complex. In particular, the AGN selected in radio flux limited samples encompass a wide range of intrinsic X-ray/UV/optical/infrared properties for a given radio power, reflecting a number of variable factors in addition to orientation (e.g. large scale environment, accretion rate onto central black hole). There is also a growing recognition that AGN are dynamic, evolving objects that strongly influence their immediate surroundings, including the distribution of circum-nuclear gas and dust. Classification is one answer to the question of how to make sense of a phenomenon with diverse properties such as active galactic nuclei (AGN). Classification is often one of the first steps taken in a scientific endeavour, and usually precedes – and indeed stimulates – understanding of the physical causes of the phenom-enon in question. The history of science abounds with examples of classification as a first step in the road of understanding. Linnaeus produced a detailed classification schemes for living organisms long before they were understood as biological systems. Mende-leev developed the periodic table for the classification of the ele-ments some forty years before it was explained in terms of atomic and nuclear structure. The classic example of the success of the classification approach in astronomy is stellar spectral classification. After some earlier, less successful attempts by Secchi and colleagues, in the late 19th/early 20th century the Harvard group led by Pickering, Maury and Cannon succeeded in developing the stellar classification scheme that remains widely used today. Based on the relative strengths of detailed absorption features in the stellar spectra, and the requirement that the absorption line strengths vary smoothly and continuously along the sequence, the Harvard scheme identified some important patterns in the diversity of stel-lar spectra but was developed independently of any physical understanding of the stars. Such understanding only came with the subsequent development of atomic physics by Bohr and others, and the development of concepts such as ionization equilibrium and excitation of energy levels by, for example, Boltzmann and Saha. These developments allowed Payne–Gaposhkin to demon-strate that the Harvard spectral classification sequence is a se-quence in photospheric temperature, and that the abundances of most common elements show little variation along the main se-quence. This in turn aided the interpretation of the Hertzprung– Russell diagram, which underpins much of our understanding of stellar structure and evolution. In many ways active galactic nuclei (AGN) represent a more di-verse phenomenon than stars. Whereas stars emit most of their light in the optical atmospheric window, AGN emit powerfully over the full accessible electromagnetic spectrum. In consequence, AGN were discovered and classified separately at different wave-lengths as technological advances allowed new parts of the elec-tromagnetic spectrum to be opened up for astrophysical investigation. The main recognised classifications of AGN are sum-marised in Fig. 1. The first recorded description of the optical spectrum of an AGN was made by Fath (1909) who noted the strong emission lines in the nuclear spectrum of NGC1068. However, the study of the nucle-ar regions of six unusual spiral galaxies by Seyfert (1943) represents the first systematic study of a class of AGN. The rich optical spectra of AGN generated considerable interest, and led to the eventual classification of Seyfert galaxies based on the presence (Seyfert 1 galaxies) or absence (Seyfert 2 galaxies) of broad (FWHM {\textgreater} 1000 km s {\`{A}}1) permitted lines, in addition to narrow forbidden lines of [OIII], [OII], [OI], [NeIII], [NeV], [NII] etc. that are a feature of both classes (Khachikian and Weedman, 1974). The study of AGN gained considerable further impetus in the early 1960s following the dis-covery of quasars with their high luminosities, quasi-stellar appear-ance and optical spectra that are similar to those Seyfert 1 galaxies (Schmidt, 1963; Greenstein and Matthews, 1963).},

abstract = {We present the results of a five month monitoring campaign of the local active galactic nuclei (AGN) 3C120. Observations with a median sampling of two days were conducted with the robotic 15cm telescope VYSOS-6 located near Cerro Armazones in Chile. Broad band (B,V) and narrow band (NB) filters were used in order to measure fluxes of the AGN and the H$\beta$ broad line region (BLR) emission line. The NB flux is constituted by about 50{\%} continuum and 50{\%} H$\beta$ emission line. To disentangle line and continuum flux, a synthetic H$\beta$ light curve was created by subtracting a scaled V-band light curve from the NB light curve. Here we show that the H$\beta$ emission line responds to continuum variations with a rest frame lag of 23.6 ± 1.69 days. We estimate a virial mass of the central black hole M BH = 57 ± 27 {\textperiodcentered} 10 6 M , by combining the obtained lag with the velocity dispersion of a single contemporaneous spectrum. Using the flux variation gradient (FVG) method, we determined the host galaxy subtracted rest frame 5100{\AA} luminosity at the time of our monitoring campaign with an uncertainty of 10{\%} (L AGN = (6.94 ± 0.71) × 10 43 erg s −1). Compared with recent spectroscopic reverberation results, 3C120 shifts in the R BLR-L AGN diagram remarkably close to the theoretically expected relation of R ∝ L 0.5. Our results demonstrate the performance of photometric AGN reverberation mapping, in particular for efficiently determining the BLR size and the AGN luminosity.},

abstract = {Measurements of the physical properties of accretion disks in active galactic nuclei are important for better understanding the growth and evolution of supermassive black holes. We present the accretion disk sizes of 22 quasars from continuum reverberation mapping with data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) standard star fields and the supernova C fields. We construct continuum lightcurves with the $\backslash$textit{\{}griz{\}} photometry that span five seasons of DES observations. These data sample the time variability of the quasars with a cadence as short as one day, which corresponds to a rest frame cadence that is a factor of a few higher than most previous work. We derive time lags between bands with both JAVELIN and the interpolated cross-correlation function method, and fit for accretion disk sizes using the JAVELIN Thin Disk model. These new measurements include disks around black holes with masses as small as {\$}\backslashsim10{\^{}}7{\$} {\$}M{\_}{\{}\backslashodot{\}}{\$}, which have equivalent sizes at 2500$\backslash$AA $\backslash$, as small as {\$}\backslashsim 0.1{\$} light days in the rest frame. We find that most objects have accretion disk sizes consistent with the prediction of the standard thin disk model when we take disk variability into account. We have also simulated the expected yield of accretion disk measurements under various observational scenarios for the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope Deep Drilling Fields. We find that the number of disk measurements would increase significantly if the default cadence is changed from three days to two days or one day.},

@article{Zu2013,
abstract = {We use both simulated and real quasar light curves to explore modeling photometric reverberation-mapping (RM) data as a stochastic process. We do this using modifications to our previously developed RM method based on modeling quasar variability as a damped random walk. We consider the feasibility of one and two-band photometric RM and compare the results with those fr om spectroscopic RM. We find that our method for two-band photometric RM can be competitive with spectroscopic RM only for strong (large equivalent width) lines like Halpha and Hbeta, and that the one-band method is also feasible, but requires very high-precision photometry. We fail to robustly detect Halpha lags in single-band quasar light curves from OGLE-III and IV despite the outstanding cadence and time span of the data, on account of photometric uncertainties in the range 0.02-0.04 mag. Simulations suggest that success could be achieved if the photometric uncertainties were of order 0.01 mag. Single-band RM for all lines and two-band RM for lower equivalent width lines are likely only feasible for statistical estimate s of mean lags for large samples of AGN of similar properties (e.g., luminosity) rather than for individual quasars. Our approach is directly applicable to the time-domain programs within ongoing and future wide-field imaging surveys, and could provide robust lag measurements for an unprecedented number of systems.},
