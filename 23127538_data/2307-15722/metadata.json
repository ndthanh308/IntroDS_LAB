  "abstract": "In this work, we consider the Cauchy problem for the defocusing Hirota equation with a nonzero background \\begin{align} \\begin{cases} iq_{t}+α\\left[q_{xx}-2\\left(\\left\\vert q\\right\\vert^{2}-1\\right)q\\right]+iβ\\left(q_{xxx}-6\\left\\vert q\\right\\vert^{2}q_{x}\\right)=0,\\quad (x,t)\\in \\mathbb{R}\\times(0,+\\infty),\\\\ q(x,0)=q_{0}(x),\\qquad \\underset{x\\rightarrow\\pm\\infty 1}{\\lim} q_{0}(x)=\\pm 1, \\qquad q_{0}\\mp 1\\in H^{4,4}(\\mathbb{R}). \\end{cases} \\nonumber \\end{align}\n  According to the Riemann-Hilbert problem representation of the Cauchy problem and the $\\bar{\\partial}$ generalization of the nonlinear steepest descent method, we find different long time asymptotics types for the defocusing Hirota equation in oscillating region and transition region, respectively. For the oscillating region $ξ<-8$, four phase points appear on the jump contour $\\mathbb{R}$, which arrives at an asymptotic expansion,given by \\begin{align} q(x,t)=-1+t^{-1/2}h+O(t^{-3/4}).\\nonumber \\end{align} It consists of three terms. The first term $-1$ is leading term representing a nonzero background, the second term $t^{-1/2}h$ originates from the continuous spectrum and the third term $O(t^{-3/4})$ is the error term due to pure $\\bar{\\partial}$-RH problem. For the transition region $\\vertξ+8\\vert t^{2/3}<C$, three phase points raise on the jump contour $\\mathbb{R}$. Painlevé asymptotics expansion is obtained \\begin{align} q(x,t)=-1-(\\frac{15}{4}t)^{-1/3}\\varrho+O(t^{-1/2}),\\nonumber \\end{align} in which the leading term is a solution to the Painlevé II equation, the last term is a residual error being from pure $\\bar{\\partial}$-RH problem and parabolic cylinder model.",
