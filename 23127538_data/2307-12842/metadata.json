  "abstract": "We probe the existence of the $^3_{Λ_c}$H where the $NΛ_c$ potentials are derived from the quark-delocalization color-screening model (QDCSM). The $NΛ_c$ system is studied and the $NΛ_c$ scattering length so as the effective range are obtained in the QDCSM. We construct effective Gaussian-type $NΛ_c$ potentials which reproduce the $NΛ_c$ scattering data given by the QDCSM. By solving the $NNΛ_c$ three body Schrödinger equation with the Gaussian expansion method, we calculate the energies of the $^3_{Λ_c}$H with isospin $I=0$, $J^P=1/2^+$ and $I=0$, $J^P=3/2^+$ under different color screening parameter $μ$. The $J^P=1/2^+$ and $J^P=3/2^+$ states are both bound when the color screening parameter $μ$ is set to 1.0 or 1.2, where the $J^P=1/2^+$ state is bound by $0.08\\sim0.85$ MeV and the $J^P=3/2^+$ state is bound by $0.15\\sim1.31$ MeV with respect to the deuteron-$Λ_c$ threshold.",
