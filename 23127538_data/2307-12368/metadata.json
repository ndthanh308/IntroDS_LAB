  "abstract": "We explore a formulation of the S-matrix in terms of the path integral with specified asymptotic data, as originally proposed by Arefeva, Faddeev, and Slavnov. In the tree approximation the S-matrix is equal to the exponential of the classical action evaluated on-shell. This formulation is well-suited to questions involving asymptotic symmetries, as it avoids reference to non-gauge/diffeomorphism invariant bulk correlators or sources at intermediate stages. We show that the soft photon theorem, originally derived by Weinberg and more recently connected to asymptotic symmetries by Strominger and collaborators, follows rather simply from invariance of the action under large gauge transformations applied to the asymptotic data. We also show that this formalism allows for efficient computation of the S-matrix in curved spacetime, including particle production due to a time dependent metric.",
