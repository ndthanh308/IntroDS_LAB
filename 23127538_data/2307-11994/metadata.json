  "abstract": "Sequential recommender systems have demonstrated a huge success for next-item recommendation by explicitly exploiting the temporal order of users' historical interactions. In practice, user interactions contain more useful temporal information beyond order, as shown by some pioneering studies. In this paper, we systematically investigate various temporal information for sequential recommendation and identify three types of advantageous temporal patterns beyond order, including absolute time information, relative item time intervals and relative recommendation time intervals. We are the first to explore item-oriented absolute time patterns. While existing models consider only one or two of these three patterns, we propose a novel holistic temporal pattern based neural network, named HTP, to fully leverage all these three patterns. In particular, we introduce novel components to address the subtle correlations between relative item time intervals and relative recommendation time intervals, which render a major technical challenge. Extensive experiments on three real-world benchmark datasets show that our HTP model consistently and substantially outperforms many state-of-the-art models.
