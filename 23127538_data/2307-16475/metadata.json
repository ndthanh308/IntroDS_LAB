  "abstract": "We provide a characterization of homogeneous spaces under a reductive group  scheme such that the geometric stabilizers are maximal tori.  The quasi-split case over a semilocal base is of special  interest and permits to   answer a  question raised by Marc Levine  on homogeneous SL$_n$-spaces. At the end, we provide an application to the local-global principles for embeddings of étale algebras with involution into central simple algebras with involution.",
