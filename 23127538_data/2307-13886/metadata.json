  "abstract": "The current framework for climate change negotiation models presents several limitations that warrant further research and development. In this track, we discuss mainly two key areas for improvement, focusing on the geographical impacts and utility framework. In the aspects of geographical impacts, We explore five critical aspects: (1) the shift from local to global impact, (2) variability in climate change effects across regions, (3) heterogeneity in geographical location and political structures, and (4) collaborations between adjacent nations, (5) the importance of including historical and cultural factors influencing climate negotiations. Furthermore, we emphasize the need to refine the utility and rewards framework to reduce the homogeneity and the level of overestimating the climate mitigation by integrating the positive effects of saving rates into the reward function and heterogeneity among all regions. By addressing these limitations, we hope to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of climate change negotiation models, enabling policymakers and stakeholders to devise targeted and appropriate strategies to tackle climate change at both regional and global levels.",
