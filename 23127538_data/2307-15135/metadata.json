  "abstract": "The Morava $E$-theories, $E_{n}$, are complex-oriented $2$-periodic ring spectra, with homotopy groups $\\mathbb{W}_{\\mathbb{F}_{p^{n}}}[[u_{1}, u_{2}, ... , u_{n-1}]][u,u^{-1}]$. Here $\\mathbb{W}$ denotes the Witt vector ring. $E_{n}$ is a Landweber exact spectrum and hence uniquely determined by this ring as $BP_{\\ast}$-algebra. Algebraic $K$-theory of $E_{n}$ is a key ingredient towards analyzing the layers in the $p$-complete Waldhausen $K$-theory chromatic tower. One hopes to use the machinery of trace methods to get results towards $K$-theory once the computation for $THH(E_{n})$ is known.\n  In this paper we describe $THH(E_{2})$ as part of consecutive chain of cofiber sequences where each cofiber sits in the next cofiber sequence and the first term of each cofiber sequence is describable completely in terms of suspensions and localizations of $E_{2}$. For these results, we first calculate $K(i)$-homology of $THH(E_{2})$ using a Bökstedt spectral sequence and then lift the generating classes of $K(1)$-homology to fundamental classes in homotopy group of $THH(E_{2})$. These lifts allow us to construct terms of the cofiber sequence and explicitly understand how they map to $THH(E_{2})$.",
