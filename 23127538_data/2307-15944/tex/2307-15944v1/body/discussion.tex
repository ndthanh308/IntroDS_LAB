We have explored potential methods to manipulate dilemmas in multi-robot collaboration. However, an essential aspect of unveiling problems is the development of strategies to prevent them.
In the context of this paper, one potential safeguard against the challenges posed by our approach could be for the agents to maintain a certain degree of exploration that is not dependent on collaboration protocols. However, this strategy may not be effective in situations with no optimal solution.
Alternatively, a central unit could manage policies and reward exchanges between robots. This would ensure task order and possibly avoid some dilemmas.
For problems that lack optimal solutions, it may be advantageous to reconfigure them, if possible, to rely on fewer robots. This could be a strategy to reduce complexity and potential sources of conflicts.
These potential solutions open up new research avenues that need further exploration.
