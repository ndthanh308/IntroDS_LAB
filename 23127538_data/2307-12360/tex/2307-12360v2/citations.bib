This Review highlights recent developments and concepts in bioinspired nanocomposites, emphasizing tailoring of the architecture, interphases and confinement to achieve dynamic and synergetic responses. We highlight cornerstone examples from natural materials with unique mechanical property combinations based on relatively simple building blocks produced in aqueous environments under ambient conditions. A particular focus is on structural hierarchies across multiple length scales to achieve multifunctionality and robustness. We further discuss recent advances, trends and emerging opportunities for combining biological and synthetic components, state-of-the-art characterization and modelling approaches to assess the physical principles underlying nature-inspired design and mechanical responses at multiple length scales. These multidisciplinary approaches promote the synergetic enhancement of individual materials properties and an improved predictive and prescriptive design of the next era of structural materials at multilength scales for a wide range of applications.},

   abstract = {Soft materials featuring both 3D free-form architectures and high stretchability are highly desirable for a number of engineering applications ranging from cushion modulators, soft robots to stretchable electronics; however, both the manufacturing and fundamental mechanics are largely elusive. Here, we overcome the manufacturing difficulties and report a class of mechanical metamaterials that not only features 3D free-form lattice architectures but also poses ultrahigh reversible stretchability (strain > 414%), 4 times higher than that of the existing counterparts with the similar complexity of 3D architectures. The microarchitected metamaterials, made of highly stretchable elastomers, are realized through an additive manufacturing technique, projection microstereolithography, and its postprocessing. With the fabricated metamaterials, we reveal their exotic mechanical behaviors: Under large-strain tension, their moduli follow a linear scaling relationship with their densities regardless of architecture types, in sharp contrast to the architecture-dependent modulus power-law of the existing engineering materials; under large-strain compression, they present tunable negative-stiffness that enables ultrahigh energy absorption efficiencies. To harness their extraordinary stretchability and microstructures, we demonstrate that the metamaterials open a number of application avenues in lightweight and flexible structure connectors, ultraefficient dampers, 3D meshed rehabilitation structures and stretchable electronics with designed 3D anisotropic conductivity.},

Lattices are often used for their stretch-dominated behavior, which gives them a high degree of stiffness at low-volume fractions. At the other end of the stiffness spectrum, bending-dominated lattices tend to be more compliant and are of interest for their energy absorption performance. Here, we report a class of ultra-compliant interwoven lattices that demonstrate up to an order of magnitude improvement in compliance over their traditional counterparts at similar volume fractions. This is achieved by selectively decoupling nodes and interweaving struts in bending-dominated lattices, inspired by observations of this structural principle in the lattice-like arrangement of the Venus flower basket sea sponge. By decoupling nodes in this manner, we demonstrate a simple and near-universal design strategy for modulating stiffness in lattice structures and achieve among the most compliant lattices reported in the literature.},

The size, shape and arrangement of the 'building blocks' of which these materials are made are essential for defining their properties and their exceptional performance, but there is growing evidence that their deformation and toughness are also largely governed by the interfaces that join these building blocks. These interfaces channel nonlinear deformations and deflect cracks into configurations in which propagation is more difficult. In this Review, we discuss comparatively the composition, structure and mechanics of a set of representative biological interfaces in nacre, bone and wood, and show that these interfaces possess unusual mechanical characteristics, which can encourage the development of advanced bioinspired composites. Finally, we highlight recent examples of synthetic materials inspired from the mechanics and architecture of natural interfaces.},

Cellulose microfibrils, for example, can stretch or curve, changing their end-to-end length, and can also slide past each other, reorient relative directions, and bundle with neighboring microfibrils. Zhang et al. developed a computational model based on observations of onion skin epidermis that describes how these complex changes in space govern cell wall mechanics. The results inform ways to engineer multifunctional fibrous materials. Science, this issue p. 706 A physical model connects microstructure and microfibril motions to complex stress-strain behaviors of extensible plant cell walls. Plants have evolved complex nanofibril-based cell walls to meet diverse biological and physical constraints. How strength and extensibility emerge from the nanoscale-to-mesoscale organization of growing cell walls has long been unresolved. We sought to clarify the mechanical roles of cellulose and matrix polysaccharides by developing a coarse-grained model based on polymer physics that recapitulates aspects of assembly and tensile mechanics of epidermal cell walls. Simple noncovalent binding interactions in the model generate bundled cellulose networks resembling that of primary cell walls and possessing stress-dependent elasticity, stiffening, and plasticity beyond a yield threshold. Plasticity originates from fibril-fibril sliding in aligned cellulose networks. This physical model provides quantitative insight into fundamental questions of plant mechanobiology and reveals design principles of biomaterials that combine stiffness with yielding and extensibility.}}

abstract = {Biological organisms are often limited in the resources that they can use to make structural materials. Primary building blocks may be weak or brittle materials, such as minerals and biopolymers, and processing conditions by default have to be mild. Despite this, a wide range of strong and tough structures exist, including shells, bones, quills, and fibers. Meyers et al. (p. 773) review a wide range of materials and architectures used in nature to make strong and tough materials and show how many of the design principles have also been used or are being considered for manmade materials and structures. Spider silk is extraordinarily strong, mollusk shells and bone are tough, and porcupine quills and feathers resist buckling. How are these notable properties achieved? The building blocks of the materials listed above are primarily minerals and biopolymers, mostly in combination; the first weak in tension and the second weak in compression. The intricate and ingenious hierarchical structures are responsible for the outstanding performance of each material. Toughness is conferred by the presence of controlled interfacial features (friction, hydrogen bonds, chain straightening and stretching); buckling resistance can be achieved by filling a slender column with a lightweight foam. Here, we present and interpret selected examples of these and other biological materials. Structural bio-inspired materials design makes use of the biological structures by inserting synthetic materials and processes that augment the structures' capability while retaining their essential features. In this Review, we explain this idea through some unusual concepts.}}

    abstract = { In this work, the dimensional properties of milano rib and half milano rib knitted fabrics were investigated experimentally using five different take-down tension values, five different tightness values, and three different yarn types. Dry, wet, and wash relaxations were applied to the samples, and after each relaxation, course-spacings (c) and wale-spacings ( w) were measured. Loop lengths (ℓ) were also measured only after dry relaxation. Linear regression analysis was applied to the relations between c and ℓ and between w and ℓ. High correlation coefficients were found and the intercepts Ac and Aw of these linear regression equations were statistically important. Yet another regression equation between the intercepts Ac and the inclinations 1/Kc and also between Aw and 1/Kw could be applied with high correlation coefficients. The results showed that Kurbak's empirical equations were also applied to milano rib fabrics and the coefficients of the equations were given together with the most popular weft knitted fabrics. }

   abstract = {Shape morphing behavior has applications in many fields such as soft robotics, actuators and sensors, solar cells, tight packaging, flexible electronics, and biomedicine. The most common approach to achieve shape morphing structures is through shape memory alloys or hydrogels. These two materials undergo differential strains which generate a variety of shapes. In this work, we demonstrate the novel concept that 2D knits comprising of yarns from different materials can be morphed into different three-dimensional shapes thereby forming a bridge between traditional knitting and shape changing structures. This concept is referred to as Knitmorphs. Our computational analysis acts as the proof of concept revealing that knitted patterns of varying materials morph into complex shapes, such as saddle, axisymmetric cup, and a plate with waves when subjected to thermal loads. Two-dimensional circular models of plain and rib developed on CAD packages are imported to the finite element analysis software Abaqus, followed by post-processing into wires and assigning fiber material properties of different thermal coefficients of expansion and stiffness. We also propose potential applications for the concept of programmable knits for developing robots based upon jellyfish like locomotion, and complex structures similar to wind turbine blades. This novel concept is meant to introduce a new field for design when considering morphable structures.},

Existing kirigami designs for target 3D curved shapes rely on intricate cut patterns in thin sheets, making the inverse design challenging. Motivated by the Gauss-Bonnet theorem that correlates the geodesic curvature along the boundary with the Gaussian curvature, here, we exploit programming the curvature of cut boundaries rather than the complex cut patterns in kirigami sheets for target 3D curved morphologies through both forward and inverse designs. The strategy largely simplifies the inverse design. Leveraging this strategy, we demonstrate its potential applications as a universal and nondestructive gripper for delicate objects, including live fish, raw egg yolk, and a human hair, as well as dynamically conformable heaters for human knees. This study opens a new avenue to encode boundary curvatures for shape-programing materials with potential applications in soft robotics and wearable devices.},

Research efforts in the woven fabric sheet forming are currently at a point where benchmarking will lead to major advances in understanding both the strengths and the limitations of existing experimental and modeling approaches. Test results can provide valuable information for the material characterization and forming process design of woven composites if researchers know how to interpret the results obtained from varying test methods appropriately. An international group of academic and industry researchers has gathered to design and conduct benchmarking tests of interest to the composite sheet forming community. Shear deformation is the dominative deformation mode for woven fabrics in forming; therefore, trellis-frame (picture-frame) and bias-extension tests for both balanced and unbalanced fabrics have been conducted and compared through this collaborative effort. Tests were conducted by seven international research institutions on three identical woven fabrics. Both the variations in the setup of each research laboratory and the normalization methods used to compare the test results are presented and discussed. With an understanding of the effects of testing variations on the results and the normalization methods, numerical modeling efforts can commence and new testing methods can be developed to advance the field. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {Nature eloquently utilizes hierarchical structures to form the world around us. Applying the hierarchical architecture paradigm to smart materials can provide a basis for a new genre of actuators which produce complex actuation motions. One promising example of cellular architecture - active knits - provides complex three-dimensional distributed actuation motions with expanded operational performance through a hierarchically organized structure. The hierarchical structure arranges a single fiber of active material, such as shape memory alloys (SMAs), into a cellular network of interlacing adjacent loops according to a knitting grid. This paper defines a four-level hierarchical classification of knit structures: the basic knit loop, knit patterns, grid patterns, and restructured grids. Each level of the hierarchy provides increased architectural complexity, resulting in expanded kinematic actuation motions of active knits. The range of kinematic actuation motions are displayed through experimental examples of different SMA active knits. The results from this paper illustrate and classify the ways in which each level of the hierarchical knit architecture leverages the performance of the base smart material to generate unique actuation motions, providing necessary insight to best exploit this new actuation paradigm. © 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract Soft robots adapt passively to complex environments due to their inherent compliance, allowing them to interact safely with fragile or irregular objects and traverse uneven terrain. The vast tunability and ubiquity of textiles has enabled new soft robotic capabilities, especially in the field of wearable robots, but existing textile processing techniques (e.g., cut-and-sew, thermal bonding) are limited in terms of rapid, additive, accessible, and waste-free manufacturing. While 3D knitting has the potential to address these limitations, an incomplete understanding of the impact of structure and material on knit-scale mechanical properties and macro-scale device performance has precluded the widespread adoption of knitted robots. In this work, the roles of knit structure and yarn material properties on textile mechanics spanning three regimes–unfolding, geometric rearrangement, and yarn stretching–are elucidated and shown to be tailorable across unique knit architectures and yarn materials. Based on this understanding, 3D knit soft actuators for extension, contraction, and bending are constructed. Combining these actuation primitives enables the monolithic fabrication of entire soft grippers and robots in a single-step additive manufacturing procedure suitable for a variety of applications. This approach represents a first step in seamlessly “printing” conformal, low-cost, customizable textile-based soft robots on-demand.}

Machine knitting is attractive as a fabrication process because it is fast, digital (programmable), and provides access to a rich material library of functional yarns for specified mechanical behavior and integrated sensing. Our method uses elastic stitches to construct non-homogeneous knitting structures, which program the bending of actuators when inflated. Our method also integrates pressure and swept frequency capacitive sensing structures using conductive yarns. The entire knitted structure is fabricated automatically in a single machine run. We further provide a computational design interface for the user to interactively preview actuators' quasi-static shape when authoring elastic stitches. Our sensing-integrated actuators are cost-effective, easy to design, robust to large actuation, and require minimal manual post-processing. We demonstrate five use-cases of our actuators in relevant application settings.},

The tactile textiles are created via digital machine knitting of inexpensive piezoresistive fibres, and can conform to arbitrary three-dimensional geometries. To ensure that our system is robust against variations in individual sensors, we use machine learning techniques for sensing correction and calibration.

   abstract = {Textiles have emerged as a promising class of materials for developing wearable robots that move and feel like everyday clothing. Textiles represent a favorable material platform for wearable robots due to their flexibility, low weight, breathability, and soft hand-feel. Textiles also offer a unique level of programmability because of their inherent hierarchical nature, enabling researchers to modify and tune properties at several interdependent material scales. With these advantages and capabilities in mind, roboticists have begun to use textiles, not simply as substrates, but as functional components that program actuation and sensing. In parallel, materials scientists are developing new materials that respond to thermal, electrical, and hygroscopic stimuli by leveraging textile structures for function. Although textiles are one of humankind's oldest technologies, materials scientists and roboticists are just beginning to tap into their potential. This review provides a textile-centric survey of the current state of the art in wearable robotic garments and highlights metrics that will guide materials development. Recent advances in textile materials for robotic components (i.e., as sensors, actuators, and integration components) are described with a focus on how these materials and technologies set the stage for wearable robots programmed at the material level.},

The type of knit structure and the settings of the knitting machine significantly influence the fabric characteristics and its role in architectural comfort. However, there is still no open-access tool for fast and efficient analysis of textiles with consideration of their knit structure, especially if they are knitted non-uniformly. Moreover, the existing methodologies of digital modeling of the knit structure are not linked to the actual production of textiles on flat-bed knitting machines. This paper presents a tool that``that``reads'' a bitmap image that can be as well imported into a knitting machine software and generates a yarn-level geometry of the knitted textiles, that can be further integrated into the behavior analysis software within the rhino-grasshopper environment. This methodology helps to preview and analyze knitted textiles before production and can help to optimize the programming of bespoke knitted textiles for large-scale architectural applications.},

Hair strands can exist in an extensive variety of arrangements and the choice of an appropriate representation for tasks such as hair synthesis, fitting, editing, or reconstruction from samples, is non-trivial. To support such applications we present a novel mathematical representation of hair based on a class of minimal surfaces called generalized helicoids. This representation allows us to characterize the geometry of a single hair strand, as well as of those in its vicinity, by three intuitive curvature parameters and an elevation angle. We introduce algorithms for fitting piecewise generalized helicoids to unparameterized hair strands, and for interpolating hair between these fits. We showcase several applications of this representation including the synthesis of different hair geometries, wisp generation, hair interpolation from samples and hair-style parametrization and reconstruction from real hair data. © 2011 The Author(s).},

Modeling with helicoids offers a geometric approach to simulating a physical manufacturing process, which should generate geometric models suitable for downstream mechanical and validity analyses. The centerline of a yarn in a knitted fabric is specified as a geodesic path, with constrained boundary conditions, running along a helicoid at a fixed distance. The shape of the yarn’s centerline is produced via an optimization process over a polyline. The distances between the vertices of the polyline are shortened and a repulsive potential keeps the vertices at a specified distance from the helicoid. These actions and constraints are formulated into a single “energy” function, which is then minimized. The yarn geometry is generated as a tube around the centerline. The optimized configuration, defined for a half loop, is duplicated, reflected, and shifted to produce the centerlines for the multiple stitches that make up a fabric. In addition, the parameters of the helicoid may be used to control the size and shape of the fabric’s stitches. We show that helicoid scaffolds may be used to define both knit and purl stitches, which are then combined to produce models of all-knit, rib, and garter fabrics.},

Due to the regular distribution of yarn loops in a knitted structure, the homogenization theory for periodic materials can be employed. Thus, instead of considering the whole fabric sample under loading, a significantly less computationally demanding analysis can be done on a repeated unit cell (RUC). This RUC is created based on simple structural parameters of knitted yarn loops and its fabric yarns are assumed to behave transversely isotropic. Nonlinear finite element analyses are performed to determine the stress fields in the RUC under tensile and shear loading. During this analysis, contact friction among yarns is considered as well as the periodic boundary conditions are employed. The macroscopic stresses then can be derived from the stress fields in the RUC by means of the numerical homogenization scheme. The physical fidelity of the proposed framework is shown by the good agreement between the predicted mechanical properties of knitted fabrics and corresponding experimental data.}

To achieve this, a procedure to numerically synthesize and modify knitted textile geometries is investigated which takes into account yarn-to-yarn interactions, while it further allows meshing used in finite element analyses. Appropriate boundary conditions are applied to avoid unnecessary constraints, while a specific type of interaction definition between yarn surfaces is enforced to remove the effect of contact and friction. Furthermore nonlinear analysis is used to capture the geometrically significant yarn position changes resulting from the flexural motion of the looped knitted textiles. The observed anisotropic effects are explained by examining the load transfer as a function of local material architecture. In addition, both linear and nonlinear material laws are used to study the role of material nonlinearities in the mechanical behavior of this type of material at the length scale of their architecture.},

We have previously shown that sheets of Cell-Assembled extracellular Matrix (CAM), which are entirely biological yet robust, can be mass-produced for clinical applications using normal, adult, human fibroblasts. In this article, we demonstrate that CAM yarns can be generated with a range of physical and mechanical properties. We show that this material can be used as a simple suture to close a wound or can be assembled into fully biological, human, tissue-engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs) that have high mechanical strength and are implantable. By combining this truly “bio” material with a textile-based assembly, this original tissue engineering approach is highly versatile and can produce a variety of strong human textiles that can be readily integrated in the body.
Statement of Significance
Yarn of synthetic biomaterials have been turned into textiles for decades because braiding, knitting and weaving machines can mass-produce medical devices with a wide range of shapes and mechanical properties. Here, we show that robust, completely biological, and human yarn can be produced by normal cells in vitro. This yarn can be used as a simple suture material or to produce the first human textiles. For example, we produced a woven tissue-engineered vascular grafts with burst pressure, suture retention strength and transmural permeability that surpassed clinical requirements. This novel strategy holds the promise of a next generation of medical textiles that will be mechanically strong without any foreign scaffolding, and will have the ability to truly integrate into the host's body.}

The design, manufacture, and validation of the first circumferentially contractile and topographic self-fitting garments composed of NiTi-based shape memory alloy (SMA) knitted actuators that dynamically conform to the unique shape and size of the wearer's body in response to a change of the garment's temperature is introduced. Advanced materials and systems innovations 1) enable novel garment manufacturing and application strategies, 2) facilitate topographical fitting (spatial actuation) through garment architectural design, and 3) provide tunable NiTi-based SMA actuation temperatures to enable actuation on the surface of human skin. This research represents a paradigm shift for wearable applications by redefining garment fit to fully topographical conformation to the wearer through advanced materials and structures design.},

We present the first general visual programming interface for creating 3D objects with complex surface finishes on industrial knitting machines. At the core of our interface is a new, augmented, version of the stitch mesh data structure. The augmented stitch mesh stores low-level knitting operations per-face and encodes the dependencies between faces using directed edge labels. Our system can generate knittable augmented stitch meshes from 3D models, allows users to edit these meshes in a way that preserves their knittability, and can schedule the execution order and location of each face for production on a knitting machine. Our system is general, in that its knittability-preserving editing operations are sufficient to transform between any two machine-knittable stitch patterns with the same orientation on the same surface. We demonstrate the power and flexibility of our pipeline by using it to create and knit objects featuring a wide range of patterns and textures, including intarsia and Fair Isle colorwork; knit and purl textures; cable patterns; and laces.},

We extend the concept of stitch mesh modeling, which provides a powerful 3D design interface for knit structures but lacks the ability to produce actually knittable models. Knittable stitch meshes ensure that the final model can be knitted. Moreover, they include novel representations for handling important shaping techniques that allow modeling more complex knit structures than prior methods. In particular, we introduce shift paths that connect the yarn for neighboring rows, general solutions for properly connecting pieces of knit fabric with mismatched knitting directions without introducing seams, and a new structure for representing short rows, a shaping technique for knitting that is crucial for creating various 3D forms, within the stitch mesh modeling framework. Our new 3D modeling interface allows for designing knittable structures with complex surface shapes and topologies, and our knittable stitch mesh structure contains all information needed for fabricating these shapes via knitting. Furthermore, we present a scheduling algorithm for providing step-by-step hand knitting instructions to a knitter, so that anyone who knows how to knit can reproduce the complex models that can be designed using our approach.

   abstract = {Fabric sensors are made from knitted conductive yarn and can be used to measure extension in wearable technologies and composite structures. Wearable technologies have considerable potential in sport and medical applications, for example recording limb movement in injury monitoring or sporting technique analysis. The electrical resistance through the fabric varies with extension due to the change in contact area and contact force between yarns. The resistance can be interpreted using correlations with displacement to calculate the deformation experienced by the fabric sensor. This paper describes a study which works towards a realistic digital model of a single jersey knitted fabric sensor by considering a non-idealised monofilament yarn of varied cross-section in a dense knit geometry. Models are created using TexGen, software developed at the University of Nottingham, taking advantage of its facility to create complex cross-sections which vary along the length of the yarn. Subsequent finite element analysis using ABAQUS with small representative volume elements and periodic boundary conditions showed high peak stresses at the boundaries, possibly caused by the contact surface being split across the boundary. Subsequent simulations using larger numbers of stitches and with relaxed boundary conditions in the x-direction showed more realistic deformations including reduction in width and curling of the material, reducing the impact of the boundaries on the overall fabric simulation, but with significant computational cost. The results give an initial assessment of deformations and contact pressures, which will aid understanding of the non-linear response found in mechanical testing and improve knowledge of how the inter-yarn contact varies. This work lays the foundation for further work which will aim to improve the similarity between the digital knit geometry and the physical sample, model larger areas of knitted fabric, include residual stresses from manufacture and use a multifilament yarn model. Subsequently the much more complex knitting patterns produced by the manufacturer of these sensors will then be able to be modelled.},

To achieve interactive performance for notoriously slow yarn-level simulations, we propose two acceleration schemes: (a) yarn-level periodic boundary conditions that enable the restricted simulation of only small periodic patches, thereby exploiting the spatial repetition of many cloth patterns in cardinal directions, and (b) a highly parallel GPU solver for efficient yarn-level simulation of the small patch. Our system supports interactive pattern editing and simulation, and runtime modification of parameters. To adjust the amount of material used (yarn take-up) we support “on the fly” modification of (a) local yarn rest-length adjustments for pattern specific edits, e.g., to tighten slip stitches, and (b) global yarn length by way of a novel yarn-radius similarity transformation. We demonstrate the tool's ability to support interactive modeling, by novice users, of a wide variety of yarn-level knit and woven patterns. Finally, to validate our approach, we compare dozens of generated patterns against reference images of actual woven or knitted cloth samples, and we release this corpus of digital patterns and simulated models as a public dataset to support future comparisons.},

Wherever the cloth is in contact with sharp features, we insert EOL vertices into the cloth, while the rest of the cloth is simulated in the standard Lagrangian fashion. Our algorithm manifests as new equations of motion for EOL vertices, a contact-conforming remesher, and a set of simple constraint assignment rules, all of which can be incorporated into existing state-of-the-art cloth simulators to enable smooth, inequality-constrained contact between cloth and objects in the world.},

Unlike weaving, it can produce loose yet extremely stretchable fabrics with almost vanishing rigidity, a desirable property exhibited by hardly any bulk material. It also enables the engineering of arbitrarily shaped two- and three-dimensional objects with tunable mechanical response. In contrast with the extensive body of related empirical knowledge and despite a growing industrial interest, the physical ingredients underlying these intriguing mechanical properties remain poorly understood. To make some progress in this direction, we study a model tricot made of a single elastic thread knitted into a common pattern called stockinette. On the one hand, we experimentally investigate its tensile response and measure local displacements of the stitches during deformation. On the other hand, we derive a first-principle mechanical model for the displacement field based on the yarn-bending energy, the conservation of its total length, and the topological constraints on the constitutive stitches. Our model solves both the shape and mechanical response of the knit and agrees quantitatively with our measurements. This study thus provides a fundamental framework for the understanding of knitted fabrics, paving the way to thread-based smart materials.},

We report experimental evidence that the mechanical response of a knitted fabric displays such broadly distributed events both in the force signal and in the deformation field, with statistics analogous to that of earthquakes or soft amorphous materials. A knit consists of a regular network of frictional contacts, linked by the elasticity of the yarn. When deformed, the fabric displays spatially extended avalanchelike yielding events resulting from collective interyarn contact slips. We measure the size distribution of these avalanches, at the stitch level from the analysis of nonelastic displacement fields and externally from force fluctuations. The two measurements yield consistent power law distributions reminiscent of those found in other avalanching systems. Our study shows that a knitted fabric is not only a thread-based metamaterial with highly sought after mechanical properties, but also an original, model system, with topologically protected structural order, where an intermittent, scale-invariant response emerges from minimal ingredients, and thus a significant landmark in the study of out-of-equilibrium universality.},

   abstract = {In this paper, the load–extension behavior of glass plain knitted fabrics is investigated both experimentally and theoretically. Experiments are carried out by preparing two sets of samples for two directions, namely for the course-wise and wale-wise directions. The load–extension properties are explored by attaching dead weights to the lower ends of the samples. Therefore, while obtaining the load–extension properties in the loading direction, the contraction properties of the samples in the lateral directions are also investigated. By observing the load–extension and load–contraction curves, three stages are distinguished. The first stage can be attributed to the fabric extension or contraction. The second stage can be attributed to the yarn extension or contraction as well as to the changes in the shapes of the samples. The third stage can be attributed to the extension or contraction of the fibers. After obtaining the dimensional properties of a single loop in the knitted fabric, curve fittings are carried out for the three stages. In the rest of the work, a theoretical analysis is carried out to explain the first stage of extension and contraction that was explained above. In the theoretical work, the load–extension or the load–contraction behaviors of the arms of the loops are calculated by using the inflexional elastica theory. The extension behaviors of the loop heads, on the other hand, are calculated by using the extension of the circular ring, which was given in Part I. As a result of the theoretical analysis, some simple equations between the loads applied and the extensions or contractions are obtained. These equations for the extension or contraction rates depend on the initial dimensional properties of the loop, the bending rigidity of the material, frictional restraints and the Poisson ratio. The equations also show that an extension or contraction in the wale-wise direction follows Hooke’s Law, whereas an extension or contraction in the course-wise direction depends on the square root of the applied load. Providing some simple equations about the relation between the load and extension in the loading direction as well as between the load and contraction in the lateral direction are suggested, determining the contractions in the lateral direction in addition to the extensions in the loading direction, which can be used in engineering software in simulating fabric load–extension behaviors under loadings. Finally, the initial and the extended states of the fabric are drawn to scale by using 3DS Max computer software.},

The knitting directions over the surface are determined using a set of custom topological operations and a two-step global optimization that minimizes the number of irregularities. The resulting mesh is converted into a valid stitch mesh that represents the knit model. The yarn curves are generated from the stitch mesh and the final yarn geometry is computed using a yarn-level relaxation process. Thus, we produce topologically valid models that can be used with a yarn-level simulation. We validate our algorithm by automatically generating knit models from complex 3D shapes and processing over a hundred models with various shapes without any user input or parameter tuning.

   abstract = {The typical elastic surface or curve simulation method takes a Lagrangian approach and consists of three components: time integration, collision detection and collision response. The Lagrangian view is beneficial because it naturally allows for tracking of the codimensional manifold, however collision must then be detected and resolved separately. Eulerian methods are promising alternatives because collision processing is automatic and while this is effective for volumetric objects, advection of a codimensional manifold is too inaccurate in practice. We propose a novel hybrid Lagrangian/Eulerian approach that preserves the best aspects of both views. Similar to the Drucker-Prager and Mohr-Coulomb models for granular materials, we define our collision response with a novel elastoplastic constitutive model. To achieve this, we design an anisotropic hyperelastic constitutive model that separately characterizes the response to manifold strain as well as shearing and compression in the directions orthogonal to the manifold. We discretize the model with the Material Point Method and a novel codimensional Lagrangian/Eulerian update of the deformation gradient. Collision intensive scenarios with millions of degrees of freedom require only a few minutes per frame and examples with up to one million degrees of freedom run in less than thirty seconds per frame.},

Due to the complexity of stitches and patterns, the macroscopic behavior of cloth is dictated by the contact interactions between yarns, not by the mechanical properties of yarns alone. The computation of cloth mechanics at the yarn level appears as a computationally complex and costly process at first sight, due to the need to resolve many fine-scale contact interactions. We propose instead an efficient representation of cloth at the yarn level that treats yarn-yarn contacts as persistent, but with the possibility to slide, thereby avoiding expensive contact handling altogether. We introduce a compact representation of yarn geometry and kinematics, capturing the essential deformation modes of yarn crossings, loops, stitches, and stacks, with a minimum cost. Based on this representation, we design force models that reproduce the characteristic macroscopic behavior of yarn-based fabrics. Our approach is suited for both woven and knitted fabrics. We demonstrate the efficiency of our method on simulations with millions of degrees of freedom (hundreds of thousands of yarn loops), almost one order of magnitude faster than previous techniques. We also compare the different macroscopic behavior under woven and knitted patterns with the same yarn density.},

They demonstrated the ability to generate significant force when pressurized and exhibited low impedance when un-actuated. To operate the soft robotic glove, a control hardware system was designed and included fluidic pressure sensors in line with the hydraulic actuators and a closed-loop controller to regulate the pressure. Demonstrations with the complete system were performed to evaluate the ability of the soft robotic glove to carry out gross and precise functional grasping. Compared to existing devices, the soft robotic glove has the potential to increase user freedom and independence through its portable waist belt pack and open palm design.},

Here, we mechanistically quantify the extreme tear resistance of skin and identify the underlying structural features, which lead to its sophisticated failure mechanisms. We explain why it is virtually impossible to propagate a tear in rabbit skin, chosen as a model material for the dermis of vertebrates. We express the deformation in terms of four mechanisms of collagen fibril activity in skin under tensile loading that virtually eliminate the possibility of tearing in pre-notched samples: fibril straightening, fibril reorientation towards the tensile direction, elastic stretching and interfibrillar sliding, all of which contribute to the redistribution of the stresses at the notch tip.},

   abstract = {(Figure Presented) The large-scale mechanical behavior of woven cloth is determined by the mechanical properties of the yarns, the weave pattern, and frictional contact between yarns. Using standard simulation methods for elastic rod models and yarn-yarn contact handling, the simulation of woven garments at realistic yarn densities is deemed intractable. This paper introduces an efficient solution for simulating woven cloth at the yarn level. Central to our solution is a novel discretization of interlaced yarns based on yarn crossings and yarn sliding, which allows modeling yarn-yarn contact implicitly, avoiding contact handling at yarn crossings altogether. Combined with models for internal yarn forces and inter-yarn frictional contact, as well as a massively parallel solver, we are able to simulate garments with hundreds of thousands of yarn crossings at practical frame-rates on a desktop machine, showing combinations of large-scale and fine-scale effects induced by yarn-level mechanics.},

In this paper, a semi-analytical tool is presented allowing to improve the fabric design by assessing the elastic properties of a stretched knit reinforced composite with several inlays. The stretched loop geometry is obtained with a loop stretching model based on the beam theory. A geometric model of the inlays is proposed. These results are used as input data of a mesoscopic scale homogenisation model to assess the composite elastic properties. A comparison of the results to the load-strain curve of a plain knit shows that the modelled loop shape is realistic, and the homogenisation model results agree with experimental data.

Abstract Recent yarn-based simulation techniques permit realistic and efficient dynamic simulation of knitted clothing, but producing the required yarn-level models remains a challenge. The lack of practical modeling techniques significantly limits the diversity and complexity of knitted garments that can be simulated. We propose a new modeling technique that builds yarn-level models of complex knitted garments for virtual characters. We start with a polygonal model that represents the large-scale surface of the knitted cloth. Using this mesh as an input, our interactive modeling tool produces a finer mesh representing the layout of stitches in the garment, which we call the stitch mesh. By manipulating this mesh and assigning stitch types to its faces, the user can replicate a variety of complicated knitting patterns. The curve model representing the yarn is generated from the stitch mesh, then the final shape is computed by a yarn-level physical simulation that locally relaxes the yarn into realistic shape while preserving global shape of the garment and avoiding "yarn pull-through," thereby producing valid yarn geometry suitable for dynamic simulation. Using our system, we can efficiently create yarn-level models of knitted clothing with a rich variety of patterns that would be completely impractical to model using traditional techniques. We show a variety of example knitting patterns and full-scale garments produced using our system.},

This paper provides measurement and fitting methods that allow nonlinear models to be fit to the observed deformation of a particular cloth sample. Unlike standard textile testing, our system measures complex 3D deformations of a sheet of cloth, not just one-dimensional force-displacement curves, so it works under a wider range of deformation conditions.

However, most current cloth simulation techniques simply use linear and isotropic elastic models with manually selected stiffness parameters. Such simple simulations do not allow diffrentiating the behavior of distinct cloth materials such as silk or denim, and they cannot model most materials with fidelity to their real-world counterparts. In this paper, we present a data-driven technique to more realistically animate cloth. We propose a piecewise linear elastic model that is a good approximation to nonlinear, anisotropic stretching and bending behaviors of various materials. We develop new measurement techniques for studying the elastic deformations for both stretching and bending in real cloth samples. Our setup is easy and inexpensive to construct, and the parameters of our model can be fit to observed data with a well-posed optimization procedure. We have measured a database of ten diffrent cloth materials, each of which exhibits distinctive elastic behaviors. These measurements can be used in most cloth simulation systems to create natural and realistic clothing wrinkles and shapes, for a range of different materials.© 2011 ACM.},

Collagen is also the dominating material in the extracellular matrix and its stiffness controls cell differentiation, growth, and pathology. However, the origin of the unique mechanical properties of collagenous tissues, and in particular its stiffness, extensibility, and nonlinear mechanical response at large deformation, remains unknown. By using X-ray diffraction data of a collagen fibril (Orgel, J. P. R. O. et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 2006, 103, 9001) here we present an experimentally validated model of the nanomechanics of a collagen microfibril that incorporates the full biochemical details of the amino acid sequence of constituting molecules and the nanoscale molecular arrangement. We demonstrate by direct mechanical testing that hydrated (wet) collagen microfibrils feature a Young's modulus of ≈300 MPa at small, and ≈1.2 GPa at larger deformation in excess of 10% strain, which is in excellent agreement with experimental data. We find that dehydrated (dry) collagen microfibrils show a significantly increased Young's modulus of ≈1.8-2.25 GPa, which is in agreement with experimental measurements and owing to tighter molecular packing. Our results show that the unique mechanical properties of collagen microfibrils arise due to their hierarchical structure at the nanoscale, where key deformation mechanisms are straightening of twisted triple-helical molecules at small strains, followed by axial stretching and eventual molecular uncoiling. The establishment of a model of hierarchical deformation mechanisms explains the striking difference of the elastic modulus of collagen fibrils compared with single molecules, which is found in the range of 4.8 ± 2 GPa, or ≈10-20 times greater. We find that collagen molecules alone are not capable of providing the broad range of mechanical functionality required for physiological function of collagenous tissues. Rather, the existence of an array of deformation mechanisms, derived from the hierarchical makeup of the material, is critical to the material's ability to confer key mechanical properties, specifically large extensibility, strain hardening, and toughness, despite the limitation that collagenous materials are constructed from only few distinct amino acids. The atomistic model of collagen microfibril mechanics now enables the bottom-up elucidation of structure-property relationships in a broader class of collagen materials (e.g., tendon, bone, cornea), including studies of genetic disease where the incorporation of biochemical details is essential. The availability of a molecular-based model of collagen tissues may eventually result in novel nanomedicine approaches to develop treatments for a broad class of collagen diseases and the design of de novo biomaterials for regenerative medicine. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

Finding so many contacts in densely interlinked geometry is a pathological case for traditional collision detection, and the sheer number of contact interactions makes contact processing the simulation bottleneck. In this paper, we propose a method for approximating penalty-based contact forces in yarn-yarn collisions by computing the exact contact response at one time step, then using a rotated linear force model to approximate forces in nearby deformed configurations. Because contacts internal to the cloth exhibit good temporal coherence, sufficient accuracy can be obtained with infrequent updates to the approximation, which are done adaptively in space and time. Furthermore, by tracking contact models we reduce the time to detect new contacts. The end result is a 7- to 9-fold speedup in contact processing and a 4-to 5-fold overall speedup, enabling simulation of character-scale garments.},

In the context of tensile deformations, these formulations usually involve the linearization of tensors, so as to express linear elasticity in a simple way. However, this approach needs significant adaptations and approximations for dealing with the nonlinearities resulting from large cloth deformations. Toward our objective of accurately simulating the nonlinear properties of cloth, we show that this linearization can indeed be avoided and replaced by adapted strain-stress laws that precisely describe the nonlinear behavior of the material. This leads to highly streamlined computations that are particularly efficient for simulating the nonlinear anisotropic tensile elasticity of highly deformable surfaces. We demonstrate the efficiency of this method with examples related to accurate garment simulation from experimental tensile curves measured on actual materials.},

   abstract = {Knitted fabric is widely used in clothing because of its unique and stretchy behavior, which is fundamentally different from the behavior of woven cloth. The properties of knits come from the nonlinear, three-dimensional kinematics of long, inter-looping yarns, and despite significant advances in cloth animation we still do not know how to simulate knitted fabric faithfully. Existing cloth simulators mainly adopt elastic-sheet mechanical models inspired by woven materials, focusing less on the model itself than on important simulation challenges such as efficiency, stability, and robustness. We define a new computational model for knits in terms of the motion of yarns, rather than the motion of a sheet. Each yarn is modeled as an inextensible, yet otherwise flexible, B-spline tube. To simulate complex knitted garments, we propose an implicit-explicit integrator, with yarn inextensibility constraints imposed using efficient projections. Friction among yarns is approximated using rigid-body velocity filters, and key yarn-yarn interactions are mediated by stiff penalty forces. Our results show that this simple model predicts the key mechanical properties of different knits, as demonstrated by qualitative comparisons to observed deformations of actual samples in the laboratory, and that the simulator can scale up to substantial animations with complex dynamic motion. © 2008 ACM.},

Abstract We present a discrete treatment of adapted framed curves, parallel transport, and holonomy, thus establishing the language for a discrete geometric model of thin flexible rods with arbitrary cross section and undeformed configuration. Our approach differs from existing simulation techniques in the graphics and mechanics literature both in the kinematic description-we represent the material frame by its angular deviation from the natural Bishop frame-as well as in the dynamical treatment-we treat the centerline as dynamic and the material frame as quasistatic. Additionally, we describe a manifold projection method for coupling rods to rigid-bodies and simultaneously enforcing rod inextensibility. The use of quasistatics and constraints provides an efficient treatment for stiff twisting and stretching modes; at the same time, we retain the dynamic bending of the centerline and accurately reproduce the coupling between bending and twisting modes. We validate the discrete rod model via quantitative buckling, stability, and coupled-mode experiments, and via qualitative knot-tying comparisons.},

   abstract = {For composite materials with complex reinforcing structures, such as knitted fabrics, a material model must be able to accommodate the most important parameters so that the material can be simulated accurately. Sometimes these important parameters can be found by examining the reinforcing structure alone. To investigate these parameters physically would be very difficult because of the scale and level of detail required; however, using advanced numerical micro-simulations a large quantity of information can be made available. By numerically simulating the tensile test of a knitted specimen the most important parts of the textile structure's deformation behaviour can be identified. In this study a numerical micro-specimen has been developed by simulating the actual fabric manufacture, so that the force-determined geometry and residual stresses incurred during the manufacturing process are captured. The two-step modelling procedure is performed using a dynamic explicit finite element code. Each filament is represented by a series of rigidly connected beam elements, which undergo a complex set of contact interactions. To validate the model, numerical simulations of the warp direction load versus extension is compared with the experimental data. It has been proposed that eight individual deformation modes exist for textile materials in general. For different reinforcing fabrics the influence of each of these mechanisms during fabric deformation is different; however, the definition of a generalised model allows user inputs for these parameters. These input data can be obtained by taking numerical measurements from the micro-specimen model, which is in itself, capable of producing different knitted structures by adjusting the boundary conditions that represent elements of the knitting machinery. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

   abstract = {This paper presents geometric and algebraic algorithms and relevant optimizing operators for 3D computer modelling of yarns in fabric. New algorithms and approaches are successfully employed to create more realistic and flexible geometry models with consideration of the differential and topological structure of yarns. By using asymptotic iterative approximation, we have developed a new algorithm for creating B-spline curves using periodic interpolation, where the actual curve shape passes through the control points of B-spline. The generator for irregular cross-sections of yarn in complex fabric structures is created with variability in both shape and size along the yarn path represented by combined spline curves, which allows the complicated shapes of yarn cross-sections in fabrics as the yarns are flattened by the compression at the crossovers. An algorithm of differential geometry is employed to track the vector of tangent orientation of the yarn path in 3D space to get the normal plane of yarn for creating the correct cross-section of yarn. The method described is demonstrated by the visualization of woven fabrics. The approach established can then be further generalized for more different and complicated fabrics (including braided fabrics and knitted fabrics) and 3D fabric. © The Textile Institute.},

The stability of the technique allows the use of a large fixed time step when simulating all types of fabrics and character motions. The animations generated using this technique are strikingly realistic. Wrinkles form and disappear in a quite natural way, which is the feature that most distinguishes textile fabrics from other sheet materials. Significant improvements in both the stability and realism were made possible by overcoming the post-buckling instability as well as the numerical instability. The instability caused by buckling arises from a structural instability and therefore cannot be avoided by simply employing a semi-implicit method. Addition of a damping force may help to avoid instabilities; however, it can significantly degrade the realism of the cloth motion. The method presented here uses a particle-based physical model to handle the instability in the post-buckling response without introducing any fictitious damping.},

This paper describes a cloth simulation system that can stably take large time steps. The simulation system couples a new technique for enforcing constraints on individual cloth particles with an implicit integration method. The simulator models cloth as a triangular mesh, with internal cloth forces derived using a simple continuum formulation that supports modeling operations such as local anisotropic stretch or compression ; a unified treatment of damping forces is included as well. The implicit integration method generates a large, unbanded sparse linear system at each time step which is solved using a modified conjugate gradient method that simultaneously enforces particles' constraints. The constraints are always maintained exactly, independent of the number of conjugate gradient iterations, which is typically small. The resulting simulation system is significantly faster than previous accounts of cloth simulation systems in the literature.},

Our main goal is to be able to simulate any kind of surface without imposing restrictions on shape or geometrical environment. In particular, we are considering difficult situations with respect to deformations and collisions, like wrinkled fabric falling on the ground. Thus, we have enhanced existing algorithms in order to cope with any possible situation. A mechanical model has been implemented to deal with any irregular triangular meshes, handle high deformations despite rough discretisation, and cope with complex interacting collisions. Thus, it should deal efficiently with situations where nonlinearities and discontinuities are really non marginal. Collision detection has also been improved to efficiently detect self-collisions, and also to correctly consider collision orientations despite the lack of surface orientation information from preset geometrical contexts, using consistency checking and correction. We illustrate these features through simulation examples.},

   abstract = {Aconstitutive model is proposed for the deformation of rubber materials which is shown to represent successfully the response of these materials in uniaxial extension, biaxial extension, uniaxial compression, plane strain compression and pure shear. The developed constitutive relation is based on an eight chain representation of the underlying macromolecular network structure of the rubber and the non-Gaussian behavior of the individual chains in the proposed network. The eight chain model accurately captures the cooperative nature of network deformation while requiring only two material parameters, an initial modulus and a limiting chain extensibility. Since these two parameters are mechanistically linked to the physics of molecular chain orientation involved in the deformation of rubber, the proposed model represents a simple and accurate constitutive model of rubber deformation. The chain extension in this network model reduces to a function of the root-mean-square of the principal applied stretches as a result of effectively sampling eight orientations of principal stretch space. The results of the proposed eight chain model as well as those of several prominent models are compared with experimental data of Treloar (1944, Trans. Faraday Soc. 40, 59) illustrating the superiority, simplicity and predictive ability of the proposed model. Additionally, a new set of experiments which captures the state of deformation dependence of rubber is described and conducted on three rubber materials. The eight chain model is found to model and predict accurately the behavior of the three tested materials further confirming its superiority and effectiveness over earlier models. © 1993.},

Our prior work treats the special case of objects that undergo perfectly elastic deformations. Real materials , however, exhibit a rich variety of inelastic phenomena. For instance, objects may restore themselves to their natural shapes slowly, or perhaps only partially upon removal of forces that cause deformation. Moreover, the deformation may depend on the history of applied forces. The present paper proposes inelastically deformable models for use in computer graphics animation. These dynamic models tractably simulate three canonical inelastic behaviors-viscoelasticity, plasticity, and fracture. Viscous and plastic processes within the models evolve a reference component, which describes the natural shape, according to yield and creep relationships that depend on applied force and/or instantaneous deformation. Simple fracture mechanics result from internal processes that introduce local discontinuities as a function of the instantaneous deformations measured through the model. We apply our inelastically deformable modds to achieve novel computer graphics effects.},

   abstract = {Many attempts have been made to reproduce theoretically the stress–strain curves obtained from experiments on the isothermal deformation of highly elastic ‘rubberlike' materials. The existence of a strain-energy function has usually been postulated, and the simplifications appropriate to the assumptions of isotropy and incompressibility have been exploited. However, the usual practice of writing the strain energy as a function of two independent strain invariants has, in general, the effect of complicating the associated mathematical analysis (this is particularly evident in relation to the calculation of instantaneous moduli of elasticity) and, consequently, the basic elegance and simplicity of isotropic elasticity is sacrificed. Furthermore, recently proposed special forms of the strain-energy function are rather complicated functions of two invariants. The purpose of this paper is, while making full use of the inherent simplicity of isotropic elasticity, to construct a strain-energy function which: (i) provides an adequate representation of the mechanical response of rubberlike solids, and (ii) is simple enough to be amenable to mathematical analysis. A strain-energy function which is a linear combination of strain invariants defined by ϕ ( α ) = ( a 1 α + a 2 α + a 3 α –3)/ α is proposed; and the principal stretches a 1 , a 2 and a 3 are used as independent variables subject to the incompressibility constraint a 1 a 2 a 3 = 1. Principal axes techniques are used where appropriate. An excellent agreement between this theory and the experimental data from simple tension, pure shear and equibiaxial tension tests is demonstrated. It is also shown that the present theory has certain repercussions in respect of the constitutive inequality proposed by Hill (1968 a , 1970 b ).},

Then, it is useful to find a relation between loop length and courses and Wales per unit length as well as the yarn thickness because Wales and courses per unit length can be easily measured at any state while it is difficult to measure the loop length in the knitted fabrics. Therefore, it is required to find an equation, through which the value of loop length can be easily calculated from the measured values of courses and Wales per unit length at any state after the knitting process. In this work estimated equations to calculate the knitted loop length for open to normal structure and for normal to compact structure are developed. By comparing the value of the loop length predicted from this work with the other mentioned models, it was found that the calculated values are very near to the L value of the case study; so the developed equations are acceptable.

   abstract = {Three-dimensionally (3D) knitted technical textiles are spreading into industrial applications, since their geometric, structural and functional performance can be tailored and optimized on fibre-, yarn- and fabric levels by customizing yarn materials, knit patterns and geometric shapes. The ability to simulate their complex mechanical behaviour is thus an essential ingredient in the development of a digital workflow for optimal design and manufacture of 3D knitted textiles. Here, we present a multi-scale modelling and simulation framework for the prediction of the nonlinear orthotropic mechanical behaviour of single jersey knitted textiles and its experimental validation. On the meso-scale, representative volume elements (RVEs) of the fabric are modelled as single, interlocked yarn loops and their mechanical deformation behaviour is homogenized using periodic boundary conditions. Yarns are modelled as nonlinear 3D beam elements and numerically discretized using an isogeometric collocation method, where a frictional contact formulation is used to model inter-yarn interactions. On the macro-scale, fabrics are modelled as membrane elements with nonlinear orthotropic material behaviour, which is parameterized by a response surface constitutive model obtained from the meso-scale homogenization. The input parameters of the yarn-level simulation, i.e., mechanical properties of yarns and geometric dimensions of yarn loops in the fabrics, are determined experimentally and subsequent meso- and macro-scale simulation results are evaluated against reference results and mechanical tests of knitted fabric samples. Good agreement between computational predictions and experimental results is achieved for samples with varying stitch values, thus validating our novel computational approach combining efficient meso-scale simulation using 3D beam modelling of yarns with numerical homogenization and nonlinear orthotropic response surface constitutive modelling on the macro-scale.},

   abstract = {Knitted textiles have been used in medical applications due to their high flexibility and low tendency to fray. Their mechanics have, however, received limited attention. A constitutive model for soft tissue using a strain energy function was extended, by including shear and increasing the number and order of coefficients, to represent the non-linear warp-weft coupled mechanics of coarse textile knits under uniaxial tension. The constitutive relationship was implemented in a commercial finite element package. The model and its implementation were verified and validated for uniaxial tension and simple shear using patch tests and physical test data of uniaxial tensile tests of four very different knitted fabric structures. A genetic algorithm with step-wise increase in resolution and linear reduction in range of the search space was developed for the optimization of the fabric model coefficients. The numerically predicted stress-strain curves exhibited non-linear stiffening characteristic for fabrics. For three fabrics, the predicted mechanics correlated well with physical data, at least in one principal direction (warp or weft), and moderately in the other direction. The model exhibited limitations in approximating the linear elastic behavior of the fourth fabric. With proposals to address this limitation and to incorporate time-dependent changes in the fabric mechanics associated with tissue ingrowth, the constitutive model offers a tool for the design of tissue regenerative knit textile implants. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},
