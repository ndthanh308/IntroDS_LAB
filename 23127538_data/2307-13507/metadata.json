  "abstract": "In this paper, we shall give an explicit proof that constacyclic codes over finite commutative rings can be realized as ideals in some twisted group rings. Also, we shall study isometries between those codes and, finally, we shall study k-Galois LCD constacyclic codes over finite fields. In particular, we shall characterize constacyclic LCD codes with respect to Euclidean inner product in terms of its idempotent generators and the classical involution using the twisted group algebras structures and find some good LCD codes.",
