  "abstract": "We investigate the objective performance of five high-end commercially available Hearing Aid (HA) devices compared to DNN-based speech enhancement algorithms in complex acoustic environments. To this end, we measure the HRTFs of a single HA device to synthesize a binaural dataset for training two state-of-the-art causal and non-causal DNN enhancement models. We then generate an evaluation set of realistic speech-in-noise situations using an Ambisonics loudspeaker setup and record with a KU100 dummy head wearing each of the HA devices, both with and without the conventional HA algorithms, applying the DNN enhancers to the latter. We find that the DNN-based enhancement outperforms the HA algorithms in terms of noise suppression and objective intelligibility metrics.",
