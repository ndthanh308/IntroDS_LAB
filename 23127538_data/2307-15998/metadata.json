  "abstract": "In this work we introduce the lag irreversibility function as a method to assess time-irreversibility in discrete time series. It quantifies the degree of time-asymmetry for the joint probability function of the state variable under study and the state variable lagged in time. We test its performance in a time-irreversible Markov chain model for which theoretical results are known. Moreover, we use our approach to analyze electrocardiographic recordings of four groups of subjects: healthy young individuals, healthy elderly individuals, and persons with two different disease conditions, namely, congestive heart failure and atrial fibrillation. We find that by studying jointly the variability of the amplitudes of the different waves in the electrocardiographic signals, one can obtain an efficient method to discriminate between the groups already mentioned. Finally, we test the accuracy of our method using the ROC analysis.",
