  "abstract": "We present the proof-of-concept of a method to find strongly lensed quasars using their spatially-extended photometric variability through difference imaging in cadenced imaging survey data. We apply the method to Pan-STARRS, starting with an initial selection of 14 107 Gaia multiplets with quasar-like infrared colours from WISE. We identify 229 candidates showing notable spatially-extended variability during the Pan-STARRS survey period. These include 20 known lenses, alongside an additional 12 promising candidates for which we obtain long-slit spectroscopy follow-up. This process results in the confirmation of four doubly lensed quasars, four unclassified quasar pairs and one projected quasar pair. Only three are pairs of stars or quasar+star projections, the false positive rate is thereby 25%. The lenses have separations between 0.81\" and 1.24\" and source redshifts between z = 1.47 and z = 2.46. Three of the unclassified quasar pairs are promising dual quasars candidates with separations ranging from 6.6 to 9.3 kpc. We expect that this technique will be a particularly efficient way to select lensed variables in the upcoming Rubin-LSST, which will be crucial given the expected limitations for spectroscopic follow-up",
