\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-3pt}

We introduced a new method for real image interpolation that can generate imaginative, high-quality sequences connecting images with different styles, content and poses.
This technique is quite general, and can be readily integrated with many other methods in video and image generation such as specifying intermediate prompts, and conditioning on other inputs such as segmentations or bounding boxes.

\paragraph{Limitations}
Our method can fail to interpolate pairs of images that have large differences in style and layouts. In Fig. \ref{fig:failures}, we illustrate examples where the model cannot detect and interpolate the pose of the subject (top), fails to understand the semantic mapping between objects in the frames (middle), and struggles to produce convincing interpolations between very different styles (bottom). We also find that the model occasionally inserts spurious text, and can confuse body parts even given pose guidance.
