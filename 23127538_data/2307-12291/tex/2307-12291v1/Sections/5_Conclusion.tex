\section{Conclusion}
\vspace{-2mm}
In this paper, we propose a brand-new framework named TransHuman for the generalizable neural human rendering task. At the core of TransHuman is a canonically optimized human representation with global relationships between human parts captured by transformers which shows superior generalization ability compared with previous methods.  However, there are remaining challenges to be explored, such as the joint optimization of fitted SMPL and training on unconstrained multi-view capture setups. We hope that our efforts will motivate more researchers in the future.
