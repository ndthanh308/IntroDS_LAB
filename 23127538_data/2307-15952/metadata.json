  "abstract": "We prove the conjecture that allows one extend the argument shifting procedure from symmetric algebra $S\\mathfrak{gl}_d$ of the Lie algebra $\\mathfrak{gl}_d$ to the universal enveloping algebra $U\\mathfrak{gl}_d$. Namely, it turns out that the iterated quasi-derivations of the central elements in $U\\mathfrak{gl}_d$ commute with each other. Here quasi-derivation is a linear operator on $U\\mathfrak{gl}_d$, constructed by Gurevich, Pyatov and Saponov. This allows one better understand the structure of \\textit{argument shift algebras} (or \\textit{Mishchenko-Fomenko algebras}) in the universal enveloping algebra of $\\mathfrak{gl}_d$.",
