  "abstract": "In this paper, we study degenerate almost complex surfaces in the semi-Riemannian nearly Kähler $\\mathrm{SL}_2\\mathbb{R}\\times \\mathrm{SL}_2\\mathbb{R}$. The geometry of these surfaces depends on the almost product structure of the ambient space and one can distinguish two distinct cases. The geometry of these surfaces is influenced by the almost product structure of the ambient space, leading to two distinct cases. The first case arises when the tangent bundle of the surface is preserved under the almost product structure, while the second case occurs when the tangent bundle of the surface is not invariant under this structure. In both cases, we obtain a complete and explicit classification.",
