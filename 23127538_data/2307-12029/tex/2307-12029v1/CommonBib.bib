abstract = {We present a detailed account of the GW space-time method. The method increases the size of systems whose electronic structure can be studied with a computational implementation of Hedin's GW approximation. At the heart of the method is a representation of the Green function G and the screened Coulomb interaction W in the real-space and imaginary-time domain, which allows a more efficient computation of the self-energy approximation Σ = iGW. For intermediate steps we freely change between representations in real and reciprocal space on the one hand, and imaginary time and imaginary energy on the other, using fast Fourier transforms. The power of the method is demonstrated using the example of Si with artificially increased unit cell sizes.}

Intriguingly, (a) the introduction of E3 makes an empirical dispersion correction redundant; (b) generalized gradient approximation (GGA) or meta-GGA semilocal correlation functionals offer no advantage over the local density approximation (LDA) in this framework; (c) if a dispersion correction is retained, then simple Slater exchange leads to no significant loss in accuracy. It is possible to create a six-parameter functional with WTMAD2 = 1.42 that has no post-LDA density functional theory components and no dispersion correction in the final energy.},

The existing DHAs are often supplemented with empirical long-range dispersion corrections. By using the extensive and chemically diverse GMTKN55 database, we explore the limits of the XYG3-type DHAs using the B3LYP reference orbitals, namely, xDH@B3LYP, with a gradually relaxed constraint on the mixing parameters of DHAs. Our results demonstrate that the xDH@B3LYP model can provide a balanced description of both covalent and noncovalent interactions with the accuracy and robustness comparable to or even better than the very expensive composite methods in wave function theory. Such an accuracy can be achieved without resorting to the use of any long-range correction scheme, shedding new light on the development of DHAs.},

		 This makes the solution of the quasiparticle equation robust

		 $\Delta\mu$ was first introduced by Hedin \cite{Hedin:1965} 
		 for the electron gas to simulate to some extent the effects

   note        = {The issue of self-consistency in $GW$ is still a matter of 
                  debate.\cite{Ku/Eguiluz:2002,Tiago/Ismail-Beigi/Louie:2004,
                  Delaney/Garcia-Gonzalez/Rubio/Rinke/Godby:2004,
                  Zein/Savrasov/Kotliar:2006,Schilfgaarde/Kotani/Faleev:2006}
		  Unlike in DFT, a self-consistent solution of the full set of equations 
		  for the self-energy in many-body perturbation theory 
		  would go beyond the $GW$ approximation and 
		  successively introduce higher order electron-electron 
		  interactions with every iteration step.
		  Solving the $GW$ equations self-consistently is therefore inconsistent
		  if no higher order electron-electron interactions are included. 
		  It was first observed for the homogeneous electron 
		  gas \cite{Holm/vonBarth:1998} that the spectral features broaden
		  with increasing number of iterations in the self-consistency cycle. 
		  Similarly, for closed shell atoms the good 
		  agreement with experiment for the ionization energy after the first
		  iteration is lost upon iterating the equations to self-consistency
		  \cite{Delaney/Garcia-Gonzalez/Rubio/Rinke/Godby:2004}. 
		  Imposing self-consistency in an approximate fashion
		  \cite{Luo/Louie:2002,Fleszar/Hanke:2005,
			Marsili/etal:2005,Schilfgaarde/Kotani/Faleev:2006}
		  is not unique and different methods yield different results.
		  Since the controversies regarding self-consistency within $GW$ have not been
		  resolved conclusively, yet,
		  we refrain from any self-consistent treatment and remain with the zeroth order in the 
		  self-energy ($G_0W_0$).
