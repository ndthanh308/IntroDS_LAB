  "abstract": "The presence or absence of star clusters in galaxies, and the properties of star cluster populations compared to their host galaxy properties, are important observables for validating models of cluster formation, galaxy formation, and galaxy assembly. In this work, we apply a Bayesian approach to fit two models to data from surveys of young clusters in star forming galaxies. The first model is a logistic regression, which allows us to include galaxies which do not have any young clusters. The second model is a hurdle model, which includes galaxies with zero clusters and also incorporates information about the total mass in the cluster system. We investigate two predictors (star formation rate and total stellar mass in the galaxy) and look at clusters younger than 10 or 100 Myr. We find that in all cases, star formation rate is the better predictor for both the probability of hosting clusters and the total mass in the cluster system. We compare our results to similar models for old globular clusters, and conclude that star cluster formation was more abundant and more efficient at higher redshifts, likely because of the high gas content of galaxies at that time.",
