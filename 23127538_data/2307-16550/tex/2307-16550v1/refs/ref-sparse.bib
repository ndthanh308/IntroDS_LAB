    abstract = "{In this paper, we study the identification of a time-varying linear system from its response to a known input signal. More specifically, we consider systems whose response to the input signal is given by a weighted superposition of delayed and Doppler-shifted versions of the input. This problem arises in a multitude of applications such as wireless communications and radar imaging. Due to practical constraints, the input signal has finite bandwidth \\$B\\$, and the received signal is observed over a finite time interval of length \\$T\\$ only. This gives rise to a delay and Doppler resolution of \\$1/B\\$ and \\$1/T\\$. We show that this resolution limit can be overcome, i.e., we can exactly recover the continuous delay–Doppler pairs and the corresponding attenuation factors, by solving a convex optimization problem. This result holds provided that the distance between the delay–Doppler pairs is at least \\$2.37/B\\$ in time or \\$2.37/T\\$ in frequency. Furthermore, this result allows the total number of delay–Doppler pairs to be linear up to a log-factor in \\$BT\\$, the dimensionality of the response of the system, and thereby the limit for identifiability. Stated differently, we show that we can estimate the time–frequency components of a signal that is \\$S\\$-sparse in the continuous dictionary of time–frequency shifts of a random window function, from a number of measurements that is linear up to a log-factor in \\$S\\$.}",
