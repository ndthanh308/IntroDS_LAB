    First, we recall that axiom \axiom{C} is a Sahlqvist formula that corresponds to the following frame property on event models:
    \begin{equation}\label{eq:A-frame}
        \forall u, v, w (u Q_j v \wedge v Q_i w \rightarrow \exists x (u Q_i x \wedge x Q_j w))
    \end{equation}

    \begin{lemma}\label{lem:systems-proof}
        $\mathcal{T}_{\textnormal{S5$_n$-}m\mathcal{A}^*} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{\textnormal{C-S5}}$ and $\mathcal{T}_{\textnormal{KG}} \subseteq \mathcal{T}_{\textnormal{C-S5}}$.

        \begin{proof}
            We focus on S5$_n$-$m\mathcal{A}^*$ (the proof for the framework by Kominis and Geffner is analogous). It is easy to see that the frames of both public ontic actions (Figure \ref{fig:ma_star_s5}, left) and semi-private sensing/announcement actions (Figure \ref{fig:ma_star_s5}, right) are reflexive, symmetric and transitive.
            
            We now show that they both satisfy frame property (\ref{eq:A-frame}). As public ontic actions contain only one event, $e_1$, this kind of event model trivially satisfies frame property (\ref{eq:A-frame}). Thus, public ontic actions are C-S5$_n$-actions.

            We now move to semi-private sensing/announcement actions. We recall that, by construction in \cite{journals/corr/Baral2015}, we have that $F \cup P = \agentSet$ and $F \cap P = \varnothing$. Let $i,j \in \agentSet$. We now have four cases:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item $i,j \in F$: we can only assign $u,v,w$ to either $u=v=w=f_1$ or $u=v=w=f_2$. In the former case, frame property (\ref{eq:A-frame}) is satisfied by choosing $x=f_1$ and, in the latter, by choosing $x=f_2$.
                \item $i,j \in P$: for any way of assigning $u,v,w$, frame property (\ref{eq:A-frame}) is satisfied by choosing $x=u$.
                \item $i \in F$ and $j \in P$: for any way of assigning $u,v,w$, frame property (\ref{eq:A-frame}) is satisfied by choosing $x=w$.
                \item $i \in P$ and $j \in F$: for any way of assigning $u,v,w$, frame property (\ref{eq:A-frame}) is satisfied by choosing $x=u$.
            \end{enumerate}

            This shows that the event models of semi-private sensing/announcement actions satisfy frame property (\ref{eq:A-frame}). Thus, semi-private sensing/announcement actions are C-S5$_n$-actions. This completes the proof.
        \end{proof}
    \end{lemma}
