\subsection{Edge-level differential privacy for graphs}
\begin{definition}{(Edge-level adjacent graphs).}
$\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{G'}$ are considered edge-level adjacent graphs if one can be obtained from the other by removing or adding a single edge. In other words, $\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{G'}$ differ by at most one edge.
\end{definition}

This notion of edge-level differential privacy (DP) for graphs provides the guarantee that it is difficult to distinguish between two graphs that differ by only one edge. In other words, it gives protection against inferring whether a particular link exists in the graph or not.

\subsection{Node-level differential privacy for graphs}

\begin{definition}{(Node-level adjacent graphs).}
$\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{G'}$ are considered node-level adjacent graphs if one can be obtained from the other by removing or adding a single node and all of its incident edges.
\end{definition}

This notion of node-level differential privacy (DP) provides a guarantee that it is difficult to distinguish between two graphs that differ only by one node. It protects the graph from inferring whether a specific node is part of the graph or not.

\begin{definition}{(1-node-1-edge-level adjacent graphs).}
$\mathcal{G}$ and $\mathcal{G'}$ are considered 1-node-1-edge-level adjacent graphs if one can be obtained from the other by removing or adding a single node with at most only one incident edge.
\end{definition}

\subsection{Defense attack}

To protect against this attack, we adopt 1-node-1-edge-level differential privacy (DP) as a countermeasure. Specifically, we use the LapGraph \cite{wu2022linkteller} algorithm, which relies on perturbing the adjacency matrix during both training and inference. The edge information remains protected even if the adversary observes the predictions made by the GNN, this is achieved because the predictions are protected through the post-processing property of DP.
