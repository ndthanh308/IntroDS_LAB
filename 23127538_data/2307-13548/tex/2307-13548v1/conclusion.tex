\section{Conclusion\label{sec:conclusion}}
In this paper, we have presented a powerful new NILS attack—a link-stealing attack using node injection against GNNs. Our results have demonstrated the superior performance of NILS compared to previous attacks, further emphasizing the vulnerabilities of GNNs regarding edge information leakage. We have also evaluated NILS against differentially private GNNs, ensuring a one-node-one-edge-level DP notion specifically designed to protect against our proposed attack.
