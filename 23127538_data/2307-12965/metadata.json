  "abstract": "In this paper, we provide sufficient conditions for a space $X$ to satisfy the Ganea conjecture for topological complexity. To achieve this, we employ two auxiliary invariants: weak topological complexity in the sense of Berstein-Hilton, along with a certain stable version of it. Several examples are discussed",
