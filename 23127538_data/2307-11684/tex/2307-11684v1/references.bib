PyTorch is a machine learning library that shows that these two goals are in fact compatible: it provides an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries, while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs.In this paper, we detail the principles that drove the implementation of PyTorch and how they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling performance. We demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as the overall speed of PyTorch on several common benchmarks.},

abstract = {The basic theory for probability one globally convergent homotopy algorithms was developed in 1976, and since then the theory, algorithms, and applications have considerably expanded. These are algorithms for solving nonlinear systems of (algebraic) equations, which are convergent for almost all choices of starting point. Thus they are globally convergent with probability one. They are applicable to Brouwer fixed point problems, certain classes of zero-finding problems, unconstrained optimization, linearly constrained optimization, nonlinear complementarity, and the discrezations of nonlinear two-point boundary value problems based on shooting, finite differences, collocation, and finite elements. A mathematical software package, HOMPACK, exists that implements several different strategies and handles both dense and sparse problems. Homotopy algorithms are closely related to ODE algorithms, and make heavy use of ODE techniques. Homotopy algorithms for some classes of nonlinear systems, such as polynomial systems, exhibit a large amount of coarse grain parallelism. These and other topics are discussed in a tutorial fashion.}

We compare its performance with that of the method developed by Buckley and LeNir (1985), which combines cycles of BFGS steps and conjugate direction steps. Our numerical tests indicate that the L-BFGS method is faster than the method of Buckley and LeNir, and is better able to use additional storage to accelerate convergence. We show that the L-BFGS method can be greatly accelerated by means of a simple scaling. We then compare the L-BFGS method with the partitioned quasi-Newton method of Griewank and Toint (1982a). The results show that, for some problems, the partitioned quasi-Newton method is clearly superior to the L-BFGS method. However we find that for other problems the L-BFGS method is very competitive due to its low iteration cost. We also study the convergence properties of the L-BFGS method, and prove global convergence on uniformly convex problems.},

  abstract = { The question of how to incorporate curvature information into
              stochastic approximation methods is challenging. The direct application of
              classical quasi-Newton updating techniques for deterministic optimization
              leads to noisy curvature estimates that have harmful effects on the
              robustness of the iteration. In this paper, we propose a stochastic
              quasi-Newton method that is efficient, robust, and scalable. It employs the
              classical BFGS update formula in its limited memory form, and is based on
              the observation that it is beneficial to collect curvature information
              pointwise, and at spaced intervals. One way to do this is through
              (subsampled) Hessian-vector products. This technique differs from the
              classical approach that would compute differences of gradients at every
              iteration, and where controlling the quality of the curvature estimates can
              be difficult. We present numerical results on problems arising in machine
              learning that suggest that the proposed method shows much promise.
