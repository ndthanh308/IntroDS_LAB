  "abstract": "We show that for $q\\in (0,1),$ the $C^{*}$-algebra $SU_{q}(3)$ is isomorphic a rank $2$ graph $C^{*}$-algebra (in the sense of Pask and Kumjian). This graph is derived by passing the to the limit $q\\to 0$ for a set of generators of $SU_{q}(3)$. Moreover, the isomorphism can be taken to be $\\mathbb{T}^{2}$-equivariant with respect the right-action on $SU_{q}(3)$ and the gauge action coming from the $2$-graph",
