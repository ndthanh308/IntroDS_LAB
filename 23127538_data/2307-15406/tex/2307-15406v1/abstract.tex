Monte Carlo methods represent a cornerstone of computer science. 
They allow to sample high dimensional distribution functions in an
efficient way. 
In this paper we consider the extension of Automatic Differentiation (AD)
techniques to Monte Carlo process, addressing the  
problem of obtaining derivatives (and in general, the Taylor series) 
of expectation values. 
Borrowing ideas from the lattice field theory community, we examine two approaches. 
One is based on reweighting while the other represents an extension of 
the Hamiltonian approach typically used by the Hybrid Monte Carlo
(HMC) and similar algorithms. We show that the Hamiltonian approach
can be understood as a change of variables of the reweighting
approach, resulting in much reduced variances of the coefficients of
the Taylor series. 
This work opens the door to find other variance reduction techniques
for derivatives of expectation values.
