\begin{abstract}
    Federated learning (FL) collaboratively models user data in a decentralized way.
    % 
    However, in the real world, 
    non-identical and independent data distributions (non-IID) among clients hinder the performance of FL due to three issues, i.e., (1) the class statistics shifting, (2) the insufficient hierarchical information utilization, and (3) the inconsistency in aggregating clients.
    % 
    To address the above issues, we propose \modelname~which contains three main modules, i.e., hyperbolic prototype Tammes initialization (HPTI), hyperbolic prototype learning (HPL), and consistent aggregation (CA).
    % 
     Firstly, HPTI in the server constructs uniformly distributed and fixed class prototypes, and shares them with clients to match class statistics, further guiding consistent feature representation for local clients.
    % 
    Secondly, HPL in each client captures the hierarchical information in local data with the supervision of shared class prototypes in the hyperbolic model space.
    % 
    % For handling issue 2, the hyperbolic prototype learning module in each client model local data in the hyperbolic model space with the supervision of fixed and shared class prototypes.
    % 
    Additionally, CA in the server mitigates the impact of the inconsistent deviations from clients to server. 
    % 
    Extensive studies of four datasets prove that \modelname~is effective in enhancing the  performance of FL under the non-IID setting.

\section{Conclusion}
    % 
    To enhance federated learning (FL) with non-IID data, we propose \modelname~which contains hyperbolic prototype Tammes initialization (HPTI) module, hyperbolic prototype learning (HPL) module, and consistent aggregation (CA) module.
    % 
    Firstly, HPTI constructs uniformly distributed and fixed class prototypes on server, and
    shares them with clients to guide consistent feature representation for local clients.
% 
    secondly, HPL models client data in the hyperbolic model space with the supervision of shared class prototypes.
    % 
    Additionally, CA mitigates the impact of inconsistent deviations from clients to server. 
    % 
    Extensive studies on four datasets prove the effectiveness of \modelname.
    % that \modelname~is effective in enhancing the performance of FL with non-IID data.
    % under the non-IID setting.
