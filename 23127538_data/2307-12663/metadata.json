  "abstract": "We perform micro-photoluminescence and Raman experiments to examine the impact of biaxial tensile strain on the optical properties of WS2 monolayers. A strong shift on the order of -130 meV per % of strain is observed in the neutral exciton emission at room temperature. Under near-resonant excitation we measure a monotonic decrease in the circular polarization degree under applied strain. We experimentally separate the effect of the strain-induced energy detuning and evaluate the pure effect coming from biaxial strain. The analysis shows that the suppression of the circular polarization degree under biaxial strain is related to an interplay of energy and polarization relaxation channels as well as to variations in the exciton oscillator strength affecting the long-range exchange interaction.",
