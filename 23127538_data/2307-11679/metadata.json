  "abstract": "On polytopal domains in $\\mathbb{R}^3$, we prove weighted analytic regularity of solutions to the Dirichlet problem for the integral fractional Laplacian with analytic right-hand side. Employing the Caffarelli-Silvestre extension allows to localize the problem and to decompose the regularity estimates into results on vertex, edge, face, vertex-edge, vertex-face, edge-face and vertex-edge-face neighborhoods of the boundary. Using tangential differentiability of the extended solutions, a bootstrapping argument based on Caccioppoli inequalities on dyadic decompositions of the neighborhoods provides weighted, analytic control of higher order solution derivatives.",
