  "abstract": "We demonstrate a violation of the ``ferromagnetic ordering of energy levels'' conjecture (FOEL) for even length spin rings. The FOEL conjecture was a guess made by Nachtergaele, Spitzer and an author for the Heisenberg model on certain graphs: a family of inequalities, the first of which is the statement that the spectral gap of the Heisenberg model equals the gap of the random walk. That first guess was originally a conjecture of Aldous which was later proved by Caputo, Liggett and Richthammer. We claim that for spin rings of even length $L>4$, the lowest spin $S=0$ energy is lower than the lowest spin $S=1$ energy. This violates the $(L/2)$-th inequality in the FOEL conjecture.\n  Our methodology is largely numerical: we have applied exact diagonalization up to $L=20$. We also rigorously consider the Hamiltonian of the Heisenberg spin ring for even length $L$ projected to the spin $S=0$ sector. We prove that it has a unique ground state. Then, using the single mode approximation the uniqueness explains the energy turn-around. Important insight comes from reconsideration of previous work by Sutherland, using the Bethe ansatz. Especially important is a work of Dhar and Shastry that goes beyond the Bethe ansatz.",
