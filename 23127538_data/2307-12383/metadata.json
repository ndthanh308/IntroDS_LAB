  "abstract": "Motivated by entanglement protection, our work utilizes a resonance effect to enhance optomechanical entanglement in the coherent-state representation. We propose a filtering model to filter out the significant detuning components between a thermal-mechanical mode and its surrounding heat baths in the weak coupling limit. We reveal that protecting continuous-variable entanglement involves the elimination of degrees of freedom associated with significant detuning components, thereby resisting decoherence. We construct a nonlinear Langevin equation of the filtering model and numerically show that the filtering model doubles the robustness of the stationary maximum optomechanical entanglement to the thermal fluctuation noise and mechanical damping. Furthermore, we generalize these results to an optical cavity array with one oscillating end-mirror to investigate the long-distance optimal optomechanical entanglement transfer. Our study breaks new ground for applying the resonance effect to protect quantum systems from decoherence and advancing the possibilities of large-scale quantum information processing and quantum network construction.",
