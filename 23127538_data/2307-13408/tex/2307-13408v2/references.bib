This paper focuses on approaches that provide a human manager with a visualized decision making tool for market segmentation. We propose a novel market segmentation approach, namely the hierarchical self-organizing segmentation model (HSOS), for dealing with a real-world data set for market segmentation of multimedia on demand in Taiwan. HSOS is able to give a human manager a general idea of market segmentation step by step, which can be considered as a potential alternative approach to other hierarchical cluster approaches for market segmentation. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

We collaborated with a local firm to host the experiment on its website with its real domain name, and the subjects were not informed of the experiment. Hence, the study provided a field observation of the subjects' behavioral responses toward privacy assurances. We found that (1) the existence of a privacy statement induced more subjects to disclose their personal information but that of a privacy seal did not; (2) monetary incentive had a positive influence on disclosure; and (3) information request had a negative influence on disclosure. These results were robust in other specifications that used alternative measures for some of our model variables. We discuss this study in relation to the extant privacy literature, most of which employs surveys and laboratory experiments for data collection, and draw related managerial implications.},

   abstract = {The k-means algorithm is well known for its efficiency in clustering large data sets. However, working only on numeric values prohibits it from being used to cluster real world data containing categorical values. In this paper we present two algorithms which extend the k-means algorithm to categorical domains and domains with mixed numeric and categorical values. The k-modes algorithm uses a simple matching dissimilarity measure to deal with categorical objects, replaces the means of clusters with modes, and uses a frequency-based method to update modes in the clustering process to minimise the clustering cost function. With these extensions the k-modes algorithm enables the clustering of categorical data in a fashion similar to k-means. The k-prototypes algorithm, through the definition of a combined dissimilarity measure, further integrates the k-means and k-modes algorithms to allow for clustering objects described by mixed numeric and categorical attributes. We use the well known soybean disease and credit approval data sets to demonstrate the clustering performance of the two algorithms. Our experiments on two real world data sets with half a million objects each show that the two algorithms are efficient when clustering large data sets, which is critical to data mining applications.},

   abstract = {Social media provide a platform for quick and seamless access to information. However, the propagation of false information, especially during the last year, raises major concerns, especially given the fact that social media are the primary source of information for a large percentage of the population. False information may manipulate people's beliefs and have real-life consequences. .erefore, one major challenge is to automatically identify false information by categorizing it into diierent types and notify users about the credibility of diierent articles shared online. Existing approaches primarily focus on feature generation and selection from various sources, including corpus-related features. However, so far, prior work has not paid considerable aaention to the following question: how can we accurately distinguish diierent categories of false news, solely based on the content? In this paper we work on answering this question. In particular , we propose a tensor modeling of the problem, where we capture latent relations between articles and terms, as well as spa-tial/contextual relations between terms, towards unlocking the full potential of the content. Furthermore, we propose an ensemble method which judiciously combines and consolidates results form diierent tensor decompositions into clean, coherent, and high-accuracy groups of articles that belong to diierent categories of false news. We extensively evaluate our proposed method on real data, for which we have labels, and demonstrate that the proposed algorithm was able to identify all diierent false news categories within the corpus, with average homogeneity per group of up to 80%.},

Across three studies of US individuals, we assess the nomological validity of this measure of financial vulnerability through its relationship with positive and negative financial outcomes (e.g., savings levels, paying credit card balances in full each month, being in arrears) as well as relevant psychological characteristics (e.g., personal savings orientation [PSO], money management skills, financial self-efficacy). Moreover, we examine whether and how these psychological characteristics mediate the relationship between financial vulnerability and financial outcomes.

Yet the opaque scoring system makes it nearly impossible for an individual to break out of a cycle of low credit ratings and participate in the benefits of the American economy. Partially as a response, alternative credit rating products now use personal nonfinancial data for automated credit decision-making, purportedly intended to expand access to credit. Social media activity, college grades, and even what time of day a person applies for a loan are examples of data points used for this purpose. However, these and other alternative data can be highly correlated with protected traits, such as race and national origin. While extending access to credit equitably across society is an important goal, the cure should not exacerbate the same inequalities that it is designed to address. The necessity of credit for the modern consumer compels continued oversight of the credit infrastructure to ensure fair data practices and to hold participants accountable. This article contends that consumer access to a fair credit score is a necessity, and that the consumer credit infrastructure should be viewed as a modern utility and subject to additional oversight. A proposal is then advanced that establishes fair data duties for credit scoring entities.},

   abstract = {In 2013, the UK Government announced that seven of the nation’s largest banks had agreed to publish their lending data at the local level across Great Britain. The release of such area based lending data has been welcomed by advocacy groups and policy makers keen to better understand and remedy geographies of financial exclusion. This paper makes three contributions to debates about financial exclusion. First, it provides the first exploratory spatial analysis of the personal lending data made available; it scrutinises the parameters and robustness of the dataset and evaluates the extent to which the data increase transparency in UK personal lending markets. Second, it uses the data to provide a geographical overview of patterns of personal lending across Great Britain. Third, it uses this analysis to revisit the analytical and political limitations of ‘open data’ in addressing the relationship between access to finance and economic marginalisation. Although a binary policy imaginary of ‘inclusion-exclusion’ has historically driven advocacy for data disclosure, recent literatures on financial exclusion generate the need for more complex and variegated understandings of economic marginalisation. The paper questions the relationship between transparency and data disclosure, the policy push for financial inclusion, and patterns of indebtedness and economic marginalisation in a world where ‘fringe finance’ has become mainstream. Drawing on these literatures, this analysis suggests that data disclosure, and the transparency it affords, is a necessary but not sufficient tool in understanding the distributional implications of variegated access to credit.},

   abstract = {Subprime credit, a relatively new method of risk-based pricing, has been hailed as a way to open up markets and provide access to credit to those who would otherwise be excluded. Evidence suggests that subprime mortgage segmentation increases rather than reduces exclusionary practices in lending. Furthermore, what is unclear is how lenders determine who qualifies as a subprime borrower. This concern became manifested when studies demonstrated that minority borrowers, regardless of creditworthiness, are more likely to receive expensive, sub-prime loans. The disparity is properly attributed to lenders’ credit pricing policies which included discretionary increases despite the objectively-determined risk-based interest rate as well as minority borrowers’ search costs and asymmetric information about prices in this market. This Article reviews the theory and history of credit scoring in mortgage lending and argues that lenders’ practices arguably justified by "legitimate business need" as well as lenders’ credit scoring models exacerbate lending disparities. It argues that the failure of competitive forces to disallow these unjustified and illegal increases also speaks to regulatory failure. It proposes that lenders operating in noncompetitive subprime mortgage markets address how their practices interact with lending disparities even apart from their complicity in creating conditions that worsen economic disadvantage.},

   abstract = {Developing accurate analytical credit scoring models has become a major focus for financial institutions. For this purpose, numerous classification algorithms have been proposed for credit scoring. However, the application of deep learning algorithms for classification has been largely ignored in the credit scoring literature. The main motivation for this research is to consider the appropriateness of deep learning algorithms for credit scoring. To this end two deep learning architectures are constructed, namely a multilayer perceptron network and a deep belief network, and their performance compared to that of two conventional methods and two ensemble methods for credit scoring. The models are then evaluated using a range of credit scoring data sets and performance measures. Furthermore, Bayesian statistical testing procedures are introduced in the context of credit scoring and compared to frequentist non-parametric testing procedures which have traditionally been considered best practice in credit scoring. This comparison will highlight the benefits of Bayesian statistical procedures and secure empirical findings. Two main conclusions emerge from comparing the different classification algorithms for credit scoring. Firstly, the ensemble method, XGBoost, is the best performing method for credit scoring of all the methods considered here. Secondly, deep neural networks do not outperform their shallower counterparts and are considerably more computationally expensive to construct. Therefore, deep learning algorithms do not seem to be appropriate models for credit scoring based on this comparison and XGBoost should be preferred over the other credit scoring methods considered here when classification performance is the main objective of credit scoring activities.},

While it may be obvious that replacing humans with machines would increase efficiency, it is not clear whether and where machines can make better decisions than humans. We answer this question in the context of crowd lending, where decisions are traditionally made by a crowd of investors. Using data from Prosper.com, we show that a reasonably sophisticated ML algorithm predicts listing default probability more accurately than crowd investors. The dominance of the machine over the crowd is more pronounced for highly risky listings. We then use the machine to make investment decisions, and find that the machine benefits not only the lenders but also the borrowers. When machine prediction is used to select loans, it leads to a higher rate of return for investors and more funding opportunities for borrowers with few alternative funding options. We also find suggestive evidence that the machine is biased in gender and race even when it does not use gender and race information as input. We propose a general and effective “debiasing” method that can be applied to any prediction focused ML applications, and demonstrate its use in our context. We show that the debiased ML algorithm, which suffers from lower prediction accuracy, still leads to better investment decisions compared with the crowd. These results indicate that ML can help crowd lending platforms better fulfill the promise of providing access to financial resources to otherwise underserved individuals and ensure fairness in the allocation of these resources.},

The borrowers most positively affected are the “invisible primes”–borrowers with low credit scores and short credit histories, but also a low propensity to default. We show that funding loans to these borrowers leads to better economic outcomes for the borrowers and higher returns for the fintech platform.},

In human activities, Zipf's law describes, for example, the frequency of appearance of words in a text or the purchase types in shopping patterns. In the latter, the uneven distribution of transaction types is bound with the temporal sequences of purchases of individual choices. In this work, we define a framework using a text compression technique on the sequences of credit card purchases to detect ubiquitous patterns of collective behavior. Clustering the consumers by their similarity in purchase sequences, we detect five consumer groups. Remarkably, post checking, individuals in each group are also similar in their age, total expenditure, gender, and the diversity of their social and mobility networks extracted from their mobile phone records. By properly deconstructing transaction data with Zipf-like distributions, this method uncovers sets of significant sequences that reveal insights on collective human behavior.},

Previous studies of financial exclusion in the UK have generally focused on a particular financial service, such as bank accounts, and have incorporated differing methods and models of investigation. Thus, comparing and contrasting significant influences on exclusion across a range of financial services proves problematic. The current study uses a common model to test and compare influences on exclusion for a wide range of financial services. Findings show that the most consistent and significant influences on financial exclusion are employment status, household income, and housing tenure, closely followed by marital status, age, and level of academic qualification. A more complex relationship with the remaining explanatory variables is apparent.},

We use cluster analysis of matched survey and administrative data to identify groups of pension plan members that are alike in their attitudes toward retirement saving. We find that engaged and disengaged members segregate into groups based on their interest and trust. Group membership in turn helps predict plan engagement, as proxied by nondefault choices. Specifically, engagement is stronger among interested groups. Trust, however, has a more complex relationship with engagement, particularly as it interacts with interest. While members with low interest and high trust are less likely to engage (e.g., by not checking plan performance), less trusting members engage more (e.g., by actively choosing asset allocations). As interest and trust successfully determine group membership, and ultimately engagement, pension plan providers should address members' diverse needs and circumstances with personalized approaches.},

The fine-grained transaction data—approximately 60 million debit transactions involving around 132,000 customers to >1.5 million different counterparties over a one-year period—reveal a pseudo-social network that supports the derivation of behavioral similarity measures. To advance decision support systems literature, this study validates the proposed customer life event prediction model in a real-world setting in the financial services industry; compares models that rely on aggregated data, fine-grained transaction data, and their combination; and extends existing methods to incorporate fine-grained data that preserve recency, frequency, and monetary value information of the transactions. The results show that the proposed model predicts life events significantly better than random guessing, especially with the combination of fine-grained transaction and aggregated data. Incorporating recency, frequency, and monetary value information of fine-grained transaction data also significantly improves performance compared with models based on binary logs. Fine-grained transaction data accounts for the largest part of the total variable importance, for all but one of the life events.},

In addition, in an ordered probit model, the significant determinants of financial vulnerability are income level, marital status, age, level of education, and financial behavior in money management.

Despite the advances and applications of machine learning models in credit scoring, there are still two major issues: the incapability of some of the machine learning models to explain predictions; and the issue of imbalanced datasets. As such, there is a need for a thorough survey of recent literature in credit scoring. This article employs a systematic literature survey approach to systematically review statistical and machine learning models in credit scoring, to identify limitations in literature, to propose a guiding machine learning framework, and to point to emerging directions. This literature survey is based on 74 primary studies, such as journal and conference articles, that were published between 2010 and 2018. According to the meta-analysis of this literature survey, we found that in general, an ensemble of classifiers performs better than single classifiers.

However, there are some drawbacks for data mining tool, such as neural networks has long training times and genetic algorithm is brute computing method. This study proposes a new procedure, joining quantitative value of RFM attributes and K-means algorithm into rough set theory (RS theory), to extract meaning rules, and it can effectively improve these drawbacks. Three purposes involved in this study in the following: (1) discretize continuous attributes to enhance the rough sets algorithm; (2) cluster customer value as output (customer loyalty) that is partitioned into 3, 5 and 7 classes based on subjective view, then see which class is the best in accuracy rate; and (3) find out the characteristic of customer in order to strengthen CRM. A practical collected C-company dataset in Taiwan's electronic industry is employed in empirical case study to illustrate the proposed procedure. Referring to [Hughes, A. M. (1994). Strategic database marketing. Chicago: Probus Publishing Company], this study firstly utilizes RFM model to yield quantitative value as input attributes; next, uses K-means algorithm to cluster customer value; finally, employs rough sets (the LEM2 algorithm) to mine classification rules that help enterprises driving an excellent CRM. In analysis of the empirical results, the proposed procedure outperforms the methods listed in terms of accuracy rate regardless of 3, 5 and 7 classes on output, and generates understandable decision rules. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

For data sets involving a large number of categorical variables, latent class procedures become computationally extremly slow and hence infeasible. We conjecture that, although in some cases latent class procedures might perform better than K-modes, it could out-perform latent class procedures in other cases. Hence, we recommend that these two approaches be used as "complementary" procedures in performing cluster analysis. We also present an empirical comparison of K-modes and latent class, where the former method prevails.},

Impaired credit ratings soared to the point that ratings agencies were compelled to restore the borrowing capacity of 2.3 million (albeit without forgiving outstanding loans). The increase in the rate of unsecured credit extensions by a variety of lenders hit extreme levels and led to demands for a ban on garnishee orders. Underlying the surface explosion of consumer credit and resulting increase in social tension was the overall economic downturn since 2008. This reflected not only the prior five years of dramatic over-borrowing, but a generalised condition of financialisation that emerged during capitalist crisis management in the context of political democratisation. The retail financial sector witnessed an unprecedented degree of liberalisation, especially higher interest rates and new credit products. Moreover, the National Credit Act of 2005 stressed the role of debt counsellors rather than shared liability for debt workouts. The growing contradictions in consumer credit have in the past generated fierce resistance. A quarter century earlier, a more aggressive collective default strategy characterised a similar era: the bond boycott. Whether the contradictions generate a similar collective reaction depends upon political agency, and the emergence of a 'United Front' can potentially relink labour and community self-interests in a decisive manner.},

However, many of these households have mobile phones, which generate rich data about behavior. This article shows that behavioral signatures in mobile phone data predict default, using call records matched to repayment outcomes for credit extended by a South American telecom. On a sample of individuals with (thin) financial histories, our method actually outperforms models using credit bureau information, both within time and when tested on a different time period. But our method also attains similar performance on those without financial histories, who cannot be scored using traditional methods. Individuals in the highest quintile of risk by our measure are 2.8 times more likely to default than those in the lowest quintile. The method forms the basis for new forms of credit that reach the unbanked.},

Seminal academic research has evaluated bankruptcy using traditional statistics techniques (e.g. discriminant analysis and logistic regression) and early artificial intelligence models (e.g. artificial neural networks). In this study, we test machine learning models (support vector machines, bagging, boosting, and random forest) to predict bankruptcy one year prior to the event, and compare their performance with results from discriminant analysis, logistic regression, and neural networks. We use data from 1985 to 2013 on North American firms, integrating information from the Salomon Center database and Compustat, analysing more than 10,0 0 0 firm-year observations. The key insight of the study is a substantial improvement in prediction accuracy using machine learning techniques especially when, in addition to the original Altman's Z-score variables, we include six complementary financial indicators. Based on Carton and Hofer (2006), we use new variables, such as the operating margin, change in return-on-equity, change in price-to-book, and growth measures related to assets, sales, and number of employees, as predictive variables. Machine learning models show, on average, approximately 10% more accuracy in relation to traditional models. Comparing the best models , with all predictive variables, the machine learning technique related to random forest led to 87% accuracy, whereas logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis led to 69% and 50% accuracy, respectively , in the testing sample. We find that bagging, boosting, and random forest models outperform the others techniques, and that all prediction accuracy in the testing sample improves when the additional variables are included. Our research adds to the discussion of the continuing debate about superiority of computational methods over statistical techniques such as in Tsai, Hsu, and Yen (},

   abstract = {One of the aims of credit scoring models is to predict the probability of repayment of any applicant and yet such models are usually parameterized using a sample to accepted applicants only. This may lead to biased estimates of the parameters. In this paper we examine two issues. First, we compare the classification accuracy of a model based only on accepted applicants, relative to one based on a sample of all applicants. We find only a minimal difference, given the cutoff scores for the old model used by the data supplier. Using a simulated model we examine the predictive performance of models estimated from bands of applicants, ranked by predicted creditworthiness. We find that the lower the risk band of the training sample, the less accurate the predictions for all applicants. We also find that the lower the risk band of the training sample, the greater the overestimate of the true performance of the model, when tested on a sample of applicants within the same risk band - as a financial institution would do. The overestimation may be very large. Second, we examine the predictive accuracy of a bivariate probit model with selection (BVP). This parameterises the accept-reject model allowing for (unknown) omitted variables to be correlated with those of the original good-bad model. The BVP model may improve accuracy if the load officer has overridden a scoring rule. We find that a small improvement when using the BVP model is sometimes possible.},

Besides the well-known classification algorithms (eg logistic regression, discriminant analysis, k-nearest neighbour, neural networks and decision trees), this study also investigates the suitability and performance of some recently proposed, advanced kernel-based classification algorithms such as support vector machines and least-squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs). The performance is assessed using the classification accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve.

The increasing convergence between social and computer sciences has led researchers to develop automated methods to extract and analyze these digital footprints to predict personality traits. These social media-based predictions can then be used for a variety of purposes, including tailoring online services to improve user experience, enhance recommender systems, and as a possible screening and implementation tool for public health. In this paper, we conduct a series of meta-analyses to determine the predictive power of digital footprints collected from social media over Big 5 personality traits. Further, we investigate the impact of different types of digital footprints on prediction accuracy. Results of analyses show that the predictive power of digital footprints over personality traits is in line with the standard “correlational upper-limit” for behavior to predict personality, with correlations ranging from 0.29 (Agreeableness) to 0.40 (Extraversion). Overall, our findings indicate that accuracy of predictions is consistent across Big 5 traits, and that accuracy improves when analyses include demographics and multiple types of digital footprints.},

   abstract = {The political desire for further integration within the European Union will have an increasing effect on the financial services industry, including banking and credit lending. Harmonisation can potentially have great benefit for consumers as the European banks compete for their business across the Union. Harmonisation, however, brings with it a set of decisions for both credit grantors and regulators. There are issues associated with information that can be used in risk assessment to ensure fair decisions in granting credit. In the past the rules have been developed under national legislation. EU directives seek to harmonise the national rules and provide a new guidance on variables that may be held. The major concern relates to the issue of discrimination. The aim of the law is to promote the principle of equal treatment, which can be interpreted in a number of ways. The legal interpretation of discrimination does not necessarily coincide with the economic standpoint. Furthermore, previous empirical research suggests that prohibition of variables may not only affect the ability to distinguish between good and bad risk, but may also be disadvantageous to the groups the legislation is supposed to protect. This paper explores these issues from both theoretical and practical points of view. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

In March 2013, the US Social Security Administration transitioned exclusively to electronic payments, representing a large shift in payment mode mandated at the federal level. This study identifies the size and characteristics of the population impacted by this shift, by linking administrative data on Social Security payments to a nationally representative survey on the use of bank accounts and financial services. We find that the majority of unbanked Social Security recipients took up electronic payments well before the March 2013 deadline. The mandate does not appear to have increased the use of bank accounts. Instead, recipients used electronic payment cards. However, the transition to electronic payments was slowest among the most financially vulnerable households, suggesting a focus on these households as payment methods continue to develop.},

Specifically, we propose an indicator of financial vulnerability to jointly analyse different features of household financial distress, analysing its socio-demographic and economic determinants. A total number of 3102 Italian households make up the sample.The empirical analysis highlights that for the median level of the financial vulnerability index households already exhibit some important symptoms of financial vulnerability, such as problems in getting to the end of the month or an inability to face unexpected expenses. As regards the determinants of the financial vulnerability index, three findings need to be pointed out. First, the level of debt servicing is positively related to financial vulnerability and the effect is stronger for households holding unsecured debt, i.e. consumer credit. Second, financial vulnerability also increases for impulsive individuals, who may adopt impatient, short-sighted behaviour patterns which make it difficult for them to be fully aware of the consequences of their financial and spending decisions. Third, a higher level of education helps to reduce financial fragility. © 2012 University of Venice.},

This data problem has been partially circumvented by the dissemination of the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS). Based on this unique data set, we put forward a stress testing method of household balance sheets in a consistent manner across euro area countries. To this end, we put forward a metric of distress which takes into account both the solvency and liquidity position of the household and demonstrate that this metric outperforms the most common metrics used in the literature, which do not take into account the households’ asset holdings. We calibrate this metric using the country level data on non-performing loan ratios and estimate stress-test elasticities in response to an interest rate shock, an income shock and a house price shock. We find that, albeit euro-area households are relatively resilient as a whole, there are large discrepancies in the impact of macroeconomic shocks across countries. Finally, we demonstrate that our framework could be used to assess some measures mitigating losses to the banks, such as engaging in the restructurings of loans that are at risk of defaulting.},

This paper examines a cluster of new practices designed to make visible - and extract value from - those without formal credit scores in contemporary financial markets. Many 'financial inclusion' projects now attempt to score the 'credit invisible' by drawing on a range of alternative data - non-financial payment streams, academic records, behavioural signals gleaned from online or social media footprints and results generated via digitized psychometric testing - and by assessing that data in relation to models of risk assessment based on the analysis of big data. I argue in this paper that these experiments in alternative credit scoring constitute the unbanked as an important, and dubious, category of knowledge and intervention. I also argue that attempts to score the unbanked offer a revealing glimpse of many of the social and political limitations associated with projects of 'inclusion'.

   abstract = {Recent advances in machine learning (ML) and Big Data techniques have facilitated the development of more sophisticated, automated consumer credit scoring models — a trend referred to as 'algorithmic credit scoring' in recognition of the increasing reliance on computer (particularly ML) algorithms for credit scoring. This chapter, which forms part of the 2018 collection of short essays 'Autonomous Systems and the Law', examines the rise of algorithmic credit scoring, and considers its implications for the regulation of consumer creditworthiness assessment and consumer credit markets more broadly. The chapter argues that algorithmic credit scoring, and the Big Data and ML technologies underlying it, offer both benefits and risks for consumer credit markets. On the one hand, it could increase allocative efficiency and distributional fairness in these markets, by widening access to, and lowering the cost of, credit, particularly for 'thin-file' and 'no-file' consumers. On the other hand, algorithmic credit scoring could undermine distributional fairness and efficiency, by perpetuating discrimination in lending against certain groups and by enabling the more effective exploitation of borrowers. The chapter considers how consumer financial regulation should respond to these risks, focusing on the UK/EU regulatory framework. As a general matter, it argues that the broadly principles and conduct-based approach of UK consumer credit regulation provides the flexibility necessary for regulators and market participants to respond dynamically to these risks. However, this approach could be enhanced through the introduction of more robust product oversight and governance requirements for firms in relation to their use of ML systems and processes. Supervisory authorities could also themselves make greater use of ML and Big Data techniques in order to strengthen the supervision of consumer credit firms. Finally, the chapter notes that cross-sectoral data protection regulation, recently updated in the EU under the GDPR, offers an important avenue to mitigate risks to consumers arising from the use of their personal data. However, further guidance is needed on the application and scope of this regime in the consumer financial context.},

@article{Bruce2022,
   abstract = {In May 2020, Westat, in partnership with Stanford University School of Medicine, conducted a nationally-representative household survey of American attitudes and behaviors regarding COVID-19. In this article, we examine what the Coronavirus Attitudes and Behaviors Survey tells us about the impact of COVID-19 on financial status and how this impact varies by demographic characteristics, the presence of health risk factors, and financial status (including employment factors). The survey reveals significant inequality in financial impact, as those who were most financially vulnerable prior to the pandemic found themselves under greater financial strain, while those who were more financially secure have experienced a neutral or even positive impact of the pandemic on household finances. These findings have important implications for public policy as policymakers seek to target aid to those who need it most.},

This study provides an empirical analysis on financial exclusion and its association with ethnicity, using data from the UK’s Family Resources Survey. The analysis offers important new evidence on the significance of ethnicity, and it further identifies gender, family type and income as other key factors associated with access to financial products. The findings provide a valuable, new empirical dimension to our current understanding of financial exclusion and its links to ethnicity, inform the relevant political debate, and offer key evidence in support of policy initiatives targeted at enhancing financial security and well-being.},

   abstract = {Recent attempts to achieve fairness in predictive models focus on the balance
between fairness and accuracy. In sensitive applications such as healthcare or
criminal justice, this trade-off is often undesirable as any increase in
prediction error could have devastating consequences. In this work, we argue
that the fairness of predictions should be evaluated in context of the data,
and that unfairness induced by inadequate samples sizes or unmeasured
predictive variables should be addressed through data collection, rather than
by constraining the model. We decompose cost-based metrics of discrimination
into bias, variance, and noise, and propose actions aimed at estimating and
reducing each term. Finally, we perform case-studies on prediction of income,
mortality, and review ratings, confirming the value of this analysis. We find
that data collection is often a means to reduce discrimination without
sacrificing accuracy.},

Credit scoring traditionally uses socio-demographic and credit data, which we complement in an innovative manner with data from Facebook. A distinction is made between the relationships that the available data imply: (1) LALs are persons who resemble one another in some manner, (2) friends have a clearly articulated friendship relationship on Facebook, and (3) BFFs are friends that interact with one another. Our analyses show two interesting conclusions for this emerging application: the BFFs have a higher predictive value then the person’s friends and secondly, the interest-based data that define LALs, yield better results than the social network data. Moreover, the model built on interest data is not significantly worse than the model that uses all available data, hence demonstrating the potential of Facebook data in a microfinance setting.},
