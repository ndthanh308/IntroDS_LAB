  "abstract": "We study some combinatorial aspects of the fixed loci of symplectic involutions acting on hyperkähler varieties of Kummer type. Given an abelian surface $A$ with a $(1,d)$-polarization $L$, there is an isomorphism $K_{d-1}A\\cong K_{\\hat{A}}(0,\\hat{l},-1)$ between a hyperkähler of Kummer type that parametrizes length-$d$ subschemes of $A$ and one that parametrizes degree $d-1$ line bundles supported on curves in $|\\hat{L}|$, where $\\hat{L}$ is the dual $(1,d)$-polarization on $\\hat{A}$. We examine the bijection this isomorphism gives between isolated points in the fixed loci of $[-1_A]$ when $d$ is odd, which has a combinatorics related to theta characteristics. Along the way, we give a table of numerical values for a formula of Kamenova, Mongardi, and Oblomkov counting the number of components of a symplectic involution acting on a Kummer-type variety.",
