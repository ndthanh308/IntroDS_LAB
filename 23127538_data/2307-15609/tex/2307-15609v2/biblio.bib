abstract = {Individual pedestrian velocities vary over time and space depending on the crowd size, location of individuals’ within the crowd, and formation of self-organized lanes. We use empirical data to explore the spatial fluctuations of pedestrian velocities in bidirectional streams. We find that, unlike ordinary fluids, the velocity profile in bidirectional pedestrian streams does not necessarily follow a hyperbolic form. Rather, the shape of the velocity profile is highly dependent on the formation of self-organized lanes. We also show that the spatial fluctuations of pedestrian velocities along and transverse to the flow direction are widely distributed and can be modeled by a sum of Gaussian distributions. Results suggest that the effect of self-organization phenomenon is strong enough that for the same crowd size, the velocity distribution does not significantly change when pedestrians are highly mixed compared to when separate lanes are formed.}

abstract = {The main objectives of this paper are to evaluate existing measurement methods of pedestrian traffic flow and to propose a three-dimensional approach that extends Edie's definitions of fundamental traffic variables to multidirectional walking areas by using three-dimensional pedestrian trajectories. Pedestrian crowds have an areawide fundamental diagram that is similar to a network fundamental diagram of vehicular traffic. Pedestrian traffic in a multidirectional area exhibits hysteretic behavior similar to that of some other many-particle physical systems. Some of the underlying dynamics of bidirectional pedestrian streams are explored with empirical data. Pedestrian streams behave somewhat differently from ordinary fluids with regard to the viscosity concept in the models based on fluid dynamics. The velocity profile for both unidirectional and bidirectional pedestrian streams is hyperbolic (with higher values on the boundaries and lower values in the middle), opposite that of fluids. The formation and dissipation of self-organized pedestrian lanes also are explored. A modification to Helbing's social force model is proposed with regard to the attractive force between pedestrians. }

abstract = {The Network or Macroscopic Fundamental diagram (MFD) has been a topic receiving a lot of attention in the past decade. Both from a theoretical angle and from a more application-oriented perspective, the MFD has proven to be a powerful concept in understanding and managing vehicular network dynamics. In particular, the application in traffic management has inspired the research presented in this contribution, where we explore the existence and the characteristics of the pedestrian Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (p-MFD). This is first of all done from a theoretical perspective, which results in the main contribution of this research showing how we can derive the p-MFD from assumed local fundamental diagrams (FDs). In doing so, we show that we can relate the average (out-)flow from a pedestrian network as a function of the average spatial density ρ¯ and the density spatial variation σ2. We show that the latter is essential to provide a reasonable description of the overall network conditions. For simple relations between density and speed (i.e. Greenshields and Underwood fundamental diagrams), we derive analytical results; for more commonly used FDs in pedestrian flow theory, such as the triangular FD of Newell or the FD of Weidmann, we show the resulting relation by proposing a straightforward simulation approach. As a secondary contribution of the paper, we show how the p-MFD can be constructed from pedestrian trajectory data stemming from either microsimulation or from experimental studies. We argue that the results found are in line with the theoretical results, providing further evidence for the validity of the p-MFD concept. We furthermore discuss concepts of hysteresis, also observed in vehicular network dynamics, due to the differences in the queue build up and recuperation phases. We finally present some applications of the presented concepts in crowd management, network level-of-service determination, and coarse-scale modelling.}

abstract = {Within the realm of pedestrian research numerous measures have been proposed to estimate the level of crowdedness experienced by pedestrians. However, within the field of pedestrian traffic flow modelling there does not seem to be consensus on the question which of these measures performs best. This paper shows that the shape and scatter within the resulting fundamental diagrams differs a lot depending on the measure of crowdedness used. The main aim of the paper is to establish the advantages and disadvantages of the currently existing measures to quantify crowdedness in order to evaluate which measures provide both accurate and consistent results. The assessment is not only based on the theoretical differences, but also on the qualitative and quantitative differences between the resulting fundamental diagrams computed using the crowdedness measures on one and the same data set. The qualitative and quantitative functioning of the classical Grid-based measure is compared to with the X-T measure, an Exponentially Weighted Distance measure, and a Voronoi-Diagram measure. The consistency of relating these measures for crowdedness to the two macroscopic flow variables velocity and flow, the computational efficiency and the amount of scatter present within the fundamental diagrams produced by the implementation of the different measures are reviewed. It is found that the Voronoi-Diagram and X-T measure are the most efficient and consistent measures for crowdedness.}

journal = {Journal of Statistical Mechanics: Theory and Experiment},
abstract = {Pedestrian egress from training schools in the after-class period (especially in China, as children walk down stairs together with their parents) raises practical concerns related to degraded flow conditions and possible safety hazards. But it also represents a challenge to mainstream modeling approaches for several reasons: they involve heterogeneous groups (adult–child pairs), which are hardly studied compared to their homogeneous counterparts, in a complex geometry, made of staircases connected by a platform where pedestrians rotate, and over a wide range of densities. In light of our field observations at a training school in China, we develop a semi-continuous model which quantitatively reproduces the collective dynamics observed empirically and enables us to assess some guidance strategies to improve egress efficiency. In this model, which extends the optimal step approach, adults and children are described as ellipses with prescribed relative positions that evolve by successive steps handled by an event-driven algorithm, along a spontaneous semi-circular path on the platform, but may deviate from it in crowded conditions by selecting their preferred next positions. In line with the observations, most pairs walk side by side overall and only a small fraction sometimes make a detour to avoid queuing. Turning to the guidance strategies, we find that promoting front-back pairing may increase the flow, while urging people to make more detours may be counterproductive. Perhaps even more relevantly, the intuitive measure consisting in desynchronizing the flows from the different floors by shifting the ends of classes succeeds in reducing the egress time by at least 10\%.}

Stairs provide important emergency access in these types of structures, especially for upward travel. This study was a controlled experiment on ascending stairs in a typical public housing estate in Hong Kong. The participants were of different age, gender and occupation. Various movement characteristics, including ascent speed, maximum ascending level and changes in blood pressure and heart beat rate before and after the experiment were extracted and analysed. Ascending speed was related to the age of the participants and 95% of participants could ascend to four levels or more. The older participants had relatively greater differences in blood pressure and heart rate before and after the experiment. The study also showed the typical and unique movement characteristics of Hong Kong people. Taken together, the results of this study will be useful for the further development of evacuation models and for enhancing building design in Hong Kong and other Asian cities with similar pedestrian characteristics.}

Based on the intended direction given in the experiment, different types of neighbors such as U-ped (neighbor with the same intended direction), B-ped (neighbor with the opposite intended direction) and C-ped (neighbor with the intersecting intended direction) are defined. The preferable positions of these neighbors during movement are investigated under various conditions. The spatial relation is quantified by calculating the distance and angle between the reference pedestrian and neighbors. The results indicate that the distribution of neighbors is closely related to the neighbor’s order, crowd density, neighbor type and flow type. Furthermore, the reasons that result in these distributions for different neighbors are explored. Finally neighbor distributions for different flows are compared and the implications of this research are discussed. The spatial analysis sheds new light on the study of pedestrian dynamics in a different perspective, which can help to develop and validate crowd models in the future.}

Within this twofold framework, the validation of the developed models with field data plays a central role, and the acquisition of empirical evidence about human behavior during locomotion is mandatory. An empirical investigation of pedestrian personal space (i.e., the area surrounding an individual while walking and into which strangers cannot intrude without causing discomfort) is reported. The investigation was developed in an ad hoc experimental setting to collect meaningful data (e.g., measurements of the front zone of personal space under static and moving conditions). The main results are presented to illustrate both the adopted experimental setting and the related data-collection method. These results represent an innovative contribution toward defining a metric for the characterization of spatial interactions among pedestrians and allowing the validation of simulation models dedicated to the study of the dynamic behavior of pedestrian crowd phenomena. }

abstract = {In this study, we present a method to quantify the amount of congestion and the intrinsic risk in pedestrian crowds. Levels of congestion are estimated based on the velocity vector field obtained from the analysis of video recordings of moving crowds. By using data collected during supervised experiments, we show that the so-called “congestion level” allows to define a threshold for congestion under safe conditions and to measure the smoothness of pedestrian flows. The proposed approach has been compared with alternative quantities such as density, flow or the “crowd pressure” showing a more universal and consistent description of crowd motion. Later, the “crowd danger” of different pedestrian streams has been computed confirming that multidirectional motion is more dangerous than unidirectional one for equal levels of density. From a more practical perspective, the congestion level allowed to get a complete picture of the region in front of bottlenecks and to identify the formation of organized structures also under constant density and flow conditions. In addition, since only velocities are used in the computational process of the congestion level, it is more suitable for applications involving computer vision and emerging technologies, since density is usually difficult to obtain in very crowded situations. The congestion level and the crowd danger may help in the design of pedestrian facilities by simplifying interpretation of results from simulation and efficiently identify hotspots or design flaws. Finally, crowd control may benefit from the methods presented by potentially allowing a clear identification of dangerous locations during mass events.}
