  "abstract": "We study quasi-bound states of two electrons that arise in two-dimensional materials with a Mexican-hat dispersion (MHD) at an energy above its central maximum. The width of the resonance of the local density of states created by pairs is determined by the hybridization of atomic orbitals, due to which the MHD is formed. The mechanism of the quasi-bound state formation is due to the fact that effective reduced mass of electrons near the MHD top is negative. An unusual feature of quasi-bound states is that the resonance width can vanish and then they transform into bound states in continuum. We study in detail the quasi-bound states for topological insulators, when the MHD is due to the hybridization of inverted electron and hole bands. In this case, the resonance width is extremely small at weak hybridization. The highest binding energy is achieved for singlet quasi-bound pairs with zero angular number.",
