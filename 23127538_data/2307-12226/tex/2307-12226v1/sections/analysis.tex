\section{Theoretical Results}
\label{sec:theory}
We are ready for our analysis of \loki. 

\paragraph{Challenges and Opportunities.}
The $\argmax$ of per-class model probabilities is a ubiquitous component of classification pipelines in machine learning. 
In order to predict unobserved classes using metric space information, $\loki$ replaces this standard component. 
As a simple but significant change to standard pipelines, $\loki$ opens up a new area for fundamental questions. 
There are three main flavors of theoretical questions that arise in this setting:
\begin{enumerate}%[leftmargin=*, itemsep=1pt, topsep=1pt, partopsep=0pt]
    \item How does the performance of $\loki$ change as a function of the number of samples? 
    \item What minimal sets of observed classes are required to predict any class in the metric space? 
    \item How can we acquire new classes that maximize the total number of classes we can predict? 
\end{enumerate}

Excitingly, we provide a comprehensive answer to these questions for the most common metric spaces used in practice.
First, we provide a general error bound in terms of the number of samples, observed classes, problem dimension, and the diameter of the metric space, that holds for any finite metric space. 
Second, we characterize the sets of observed classes that are required to enable prediction of any class, and show how this set differs for various types of metric spaces of interest. 
Finally, we provide an active learning algorithm for selecting additional classes to observe so as to maximize the number of classes that can be predicted. We characterize the types of metric spaces for which the locus can be computed efficiently. 
Taken together, these results provide a strong theoretical grounding for $\loki$. %n exhaustive set of answers to the space of theoretical questions about $\loki$. 


%In this section, we address these questions for a variety of different metric spaces, including trees, phylogenetic trees, grid graphs, and the trivial case of the complete graph. 

%... We address all of them and comprehensively solve the entire theory space. 


%We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis of $\loki$.
