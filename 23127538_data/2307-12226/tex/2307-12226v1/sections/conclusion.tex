\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we proposed $\loki$---a simple adaptor for pretrained models to enable the prediction of additional classes that are unobserved during training by using metric space information. 
%
We comprehensively answered the space of new questions that arise under $\loki$ in terms of learning, optimal metric space settings, and a practical active selection strategy. 
%
Experimentally, we showed that $\loki$ can be used to improve CLIP even without external metric space information, can be used to predict a large number of unobserved classes, and a validation of our active selection strategy.
