We discuss the relevant phenomenology resulting from the scattering of an incident dark matter particle on a Helium nucleus. Rather than directly exciting quasi-particles, DM in this mass range will interact with a single He atom, triggering an atomic cascade which eventually also includes emission and thermalization of quasi-particles. We present in detail the analytical framework needed for modeling these processes and determining the resulting flux of quasi-particles. We propose a novel method for detecting this flux with modern force-sensitive devices, such as nanoelectro-mechanical system (NEMS) oscillators, and derive the sensitivity projections for a generic sub-GeV DM detection experiment using such sensors.},

In this paper, we propose recommendations for presenting dark matter direct detection results particularly suited for weak-scale dark matter searches, although we believe the spirit of the recommendations can apply more broadly to searches for other dark matter candidates, such as very light dark matter or axions. To translate experimental data into a final published result, direct detection collaborations must make a series of choices in their analysis, ranging from how to model astrophysical parameters to how to make statistical inferences based on observed data. While many collaborations follow a standard set of recommendations in some areas, for example the expected flux of dark matter particles (to a large degree based on a paper from Lewin and Smith in 1995), in other areas, particularly in statistical inference, they have taken different approaches, often from result to result by the same collaboration. We set out a number of recommendations on how to apply the now commonly used Profile Likelihood Ratio method to direct detection data. In addition, updated recommendations for the Standard Halo Model astrophysical parameters and relevant neutrino fluxes are provided. The authors of this note include members of the DAMIC, DarkSide, DARWIN, DEAP, LZ, NEWS-G, PandaX, PICO, SBC, SENSEI, SuperCDMS, and XENON collaborations, and these collaborations provided input to the recommendations laid out here. Wide-spread adoption of these recommendations will make it easier to compare and combine future dark matter results.},

  abstract = {The performance of superconducting qubits is degraded by a poorly characterized set of energy sources breaking the Cooper pairs responsible for superconductivity, creating a condition often called "quasiparticle poisoning." Recently, a superconductor with one of the lowest average quasiparticle densities ever measured exhibited quasiparticles primarily produced in bursts which decreased in rate with time after cooldown. Similarly, several cryogenic calorimeters used to search for dark matter have also observed an unknown source of low-energy phonon bursts that decrease in rate with time after cooldown. Here, we show that a silicon crystal glued to its holder exhibits a rate of low-energy phonon events that is more than two orders of magnitude larger than in a functionally identical crystal suspended from its holder in a low-stress state. The excess phonon event rate in the glued crystal decreases with time since cooldown, consistent with a source of phonon bursts which contributes to quasiparticle poisoning in quantum circuits and the low-energy events observed in cryogenic calorimeters. We argue that relaxation of thermally induced stress between the glue and crystal is the source of these events, and conclude that stress relaxation contributes to quasiparticle poisoning in superconducting qubits and the athermal phonon background in a broad class of rare-event searches.},

  abstract = {When using superfluid helium in low-gravity environments, porous plug phase separators are commonly used to vent boil-off gas while confining the bulk liquid to the tank. Invariably, there is a flow of superfluid film from the perimeter of the porous plug down the vent line. For the soft x-ray spectrometer onboard ASTRO-H (Hitomi), its approximately 30-liter helium supply has a lifetime requirement of more than 3 years. A nominal vent rate is estimated as {$\sim$}30 {$\mu$}g/s, equivalent to {$\sim$}0.7 mW heat load. It is, therefore, critical to suppress any film flow whose evaporation would not provide direct cooling of the remaining liquid helium. That is, the porous plug vent system must be designed to both minimize film flow and to ensure maximum extraction of latent heat from the film. The design goal for Hitomi is to reduce the film flow losses to {$<$}2 {$\mu$}g/s, corresponding to a loss of cooling capacity of {$<$}40 {$\mu$}W. The design adopts the same general design as implemented for Astro-E and E2, using a vent system composed of a porous plug, combined with an orifice, a heat exchanger, and knife-edge devices. Design, on-ground testing results, and in-orbit performance are described.},

  abstract = {In the early stages of running of the CRESST dark matter search using sapphire detectors at very low temperature, an unexpectedly high rate of signal pulses appeared. Their origin was finally traced to fracture events in the sapphire due to the very tight clamping of the detectors. During extensive runs the energy and time of each event was recorded, providing large data sets for such phenomena. We believe this is the first time the energy release in fracture has been directly and accurately measured on a microscopic event-by-event basis. The energy threshold corresponds to the breaking of only a few hundred covalent bonds, a sensitivity some orders of magnitude greater than that of previous technique. We report some features of the data, including energy distributions, waiting time distributions, autocorrelations and the Hurst exponent. The energy distribution appear to follow a power law, dN/dE{$\propto$}E-{$\beta$}, similar to the power law for earthquake magnitudes, and after appropriate translation, with a similar exponent. In the time domain, the waiting time w or gap distribution between events has a power law behavior at small w and an exponential fall-off at large w, and can be fit {$\propto$}w-{$\alpha$}e-w/w0. The autocorrelation function shows time correlations lasting for substantial parts of an hour. An asymmetry is found around large events, with higher count rates after, as opposed to before, the large event.},

As with the conventional ``thermal freeze-out'' production mechanism, the relic abundance reflects a combination of initial thermal distributions together with particle masses and couplings that can be measured in the laboratory or astrophysically. The freeze-in yield is IR dominated by low temperatures near the FIMP mass and is independent of unknown UV physics, such as the reheat temperature after inflation. Moduli and modulinos of string theory compactifications that receive mass from weak-scale supersymmetry breaking provide implementations of the freeze-in mechanism, as do models that employ Dirac neutrino masses or GUT-scale-suppressed interactions. Experimental signals of freeze-in and FIMPs can be spectacular, including the production of new metastable coloured or charged particles at the LHC as well as the alteration of big bang nucleosynthesis.},

We name this concept ``HeRALD,'' helium roton apparatus for light dark matter. A superfluid helium target has several advantageous properties, including a light nuclear mass for better kinematic matching with light dark matter particles, copious production of scintillation light, extreme intrinsic radiopurity, high impedance to external vibration noise, and a unique ``quantum evaporation'' signal channel enabling the detection of phononlike modes via liberation of 4He atoms into a vacuum. In this concept, both scintillation photons and triplet excimers are detected using calorimeters, including calorimeters immersed in the superfluid. Kinetic excitations of the superfluid medium (rotons and phonons) are detected using quantum evaporation and subsequent atomic adsorption onto a calorimeter suspended in vacuum above the target helium. The energy of adsorption amplifies the phonon/roton signal before calorimetric sensing, producing a gain mechanism that can reduce the technology's recoil energy threshold below the calorimeter energy threshold. We describe signal production and signal sensing probabilities, and estimate the resulting electron recoil discrimination. We simulate radioactive backgrounds from gamma rays and construct an overall background spectrum expectation also including neutrons and solar neutrinos. Finally, we calculate projected sensitivities to dark matter\textendash nucleon elastic scattering, demonstrating that even very small (sub-kg) target masses can probe wide regions of as-yet untested dark matter parameter space.},

The porous plug is a phase separator of the liquid and gas helium. A potential film flow leaking from the porous plug is suppressed by the orifice. Almost all the remaining film flow evaporates at the heat exchanger. The knife edge devices stop the remaining film flow by using atomically sharp edges.

  abstract = {This paper discusses microphysics simulation of interactions in liquid xenon, the medium in many leading rare-event physics searches, and describes experimental observables useful to understanding detector performance. Scintillation and ionization yield distributions for signal and background are presented using the Noble Element Simulation Technique (NEST), a toolkit based on experimental data and simple, empirical formulae. NEST models of light and charge production as a function of particle type, energy, and electric field are reviewed, as well as of energy resolution and final pulse areas. After vetting of NEST against raw data, with several specific examples pulled from XENON, ZEPLIN, LUX / LZ, and PandaX, we interpolate and extrapolate its models to draw new conclusions on the properties of future detectors (e.g., XLZD), in terms of the best possible discrimination of electron(ic) recoil backgrounds from a potential nuclear recoil signal, especially WIMP dark matter. We discover that the oft-quoted value of 99.5\% discrimination is overly conservative. NEST shows that another order of magnitude improvement (99.95\% discrimination) can be achieved with a high photon detection efficiency (g1 \textasciitilde{} 15-20\%) at reasonably achievable drift fields of 200 to 350 V/cm.},

  abstract = {We explore the phenomenology of Elastically Decoupling Relic (ELDER) dark matter. ELDER is a thermal relic whose present density is determined primarily by the cross-section of its elastic scattering off Standard Model (SM) particles. Assuming that this scattering is mediated by a kinetically mixed dark photon, we argue that the ELDER scenario makes robust predictions for electron-recoil direct-detection experiments, as well as for dark photon searches. These predictions are independent of the details of interactions within the dark sector. Together with the closely related Strongly-Interacting Massive Particle (SIMP) scenario, the ELDER predictions provide a physically motivated, well-defined target region, which will be almost entirely accessible to the next generation of searches for sub-GeV dark matter and dark photons. We provide useful analytic approximations for various quantities of interest in the ELDER scenario, and discuss two simple renormalizable toy models which incorporate the required strong number-changing interactions among the ELDERs, as well as explicitly implement the coupling to electrons via the dark photon portal.},

The detector consists of a large mass of superfluid helium at low temperatures (20 mK). When a neutrino is scattered off an electron, the recoil energy of the electron (10-6 to 10-7 erg) is deposited in the helium. This small amount of energy can be detected because of the unusual kinetics of rotons at low temperatures. It should be possible to construct a detector of sufficiently low background and large size to measure solar neutrino spectra.},

Although the thermomechanical force is quite effective in holding the liquid against the internal vapor pressure, van der Waals forces will lead to a leakage of helium through the porous plug to feed the flow of a superfluid film in the vent line. Since the latent heat is generally not extracted from the remaining liquid, the film poses a serious problem for space missions such as the X-Ray Spectrometer (XRS) which have extremely low heat load budgets. A design for the XRS porous plug and vent system is presented which keeps film losses below 2 \textmu g/s through a combination of a heat exchanger, to evaporate the film, and a knife-edge device. Tests of the vent have been conducted in a minus 1g configuration. At the expected on-orbit tank temperature of 1.22 K, film losses are negligible, but rise to 4 \textmu g/s at the maximum tank temperature of 1.30 K. Design parameters and performance tests are discussed.},
