  "abstract": "We define a new family of non-periodic tilings with square tiles that is mutually locally derivable with some family of tilings with isosceles right triangles. Both families are defined by simple local rules, and the proof of their non-periodicity is as simple as that of the non-periodicity of Robinson's tilings.",
