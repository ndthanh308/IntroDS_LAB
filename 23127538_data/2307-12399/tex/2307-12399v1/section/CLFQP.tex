\section{CLF-based Quadratic Program Solution}

\begin{itemize}
	\item This is the trivial solution after the zero dynamics analysis 
	is done. However, it lacks a proper geometric insight. Indeed, this control 
	strategy makes the robot to converge to the zero dynamics manifold in a direction perpendicular 
	to the manifold.
