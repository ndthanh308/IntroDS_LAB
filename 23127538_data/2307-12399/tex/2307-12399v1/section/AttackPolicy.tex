\section{Attack Policy Objectives}
\label{sec:AttackPolicy}
%
In this section we formulate the attack policy objectives and state our assumptions about the adversarial knowledge of 
the vehicle dynamical model. 

Following  the notation by Teixeira \emph{et al.}~\cite{teixeira2015secure}, we denote the vehicle traction dynamics in~\eqref{eq:tractionDyn2} by $\mathcal{P}$. Moreover, we let the attacker's \emph{a priori}  knowledge model $\hat{\mathcal{P}}$ be given by 
%
\begin{subequations}\label{eq:tractionDyn2approx}
	\begin{align}
	\dot{v} = -{g}_{\alpha} \hat{\mu}(\lambda),\\
	\dot{\lambda} = \frac{{g}_\alpha}{v}\big\{ (\lambda - 1 - \hat{\nu}) \hat{\mu}(\lambda) + \hat{\Upsilon}_a \big\}, 
	\end{align}
\end{subequations}
%
\noindent where the adversary has no \emph{a priori knowledge} of the dimensionless torque and force disturbances $\Upsilon_{\Delta, w}$, $\Upsilon_{\Delta, v}$. Furthermore, the adversary has only an approximate knowledge of the tire-road interaction characteristics given by $\hat{\mu}(\lambda)$. When the adversary does not have any knowledge of $\mu(\lambda)$, the friction coefficient $\hat{\mu}(\lambda)$ is set equal to $0$ in $\hat{\mathcal{P}}$.  We assume that the adversary knows and/or can compute the vehicle velocity as well as the wheel slip. This scenario corresponds to having complete access to disclosure resources in the cyber-attack space~\cite{teixeira2015secure}. 
%Indeed, as demonstrated in an experimental wireless attack against Tesla vehicles~\cite{nie2017free}, an adversary who has the capability of %reprogramming the firmware of ECUs through the Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) codified in ISO-14229~\cite{iso14229} can also read live data from %the IVN (such as vehicle speed or engine speed). 

\noindent\textbf{Wheel Lockup Attack Policy Objective.} Given the vehicle longitudinal dynamics $\mathcal{P}$ in~\eqref{eq:tractionDyn2}, the attacker's \emph{a priori} knowledge $\hat{\mathcal{P}}$ in~\eqref{eq:tractionDyn2approx}, and the  braking response in~\eqref{eq:torqueResp}, design an attack policy $\hat{\Upsilon}_a$ such that the trajectories of the vehicle longitudinal dynamics during braking converge to any sufficiently close neighborhood of the lockup manifold  $\mathcal{W}_b^L$ within a finite time interval.
