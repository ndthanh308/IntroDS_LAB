  "abstract": "Celestial amplitude plays an important role in the understanding of holography. Computing celestial amplitudes by recursion can deepen our understanding of the structure of celestial amplitudes. As an important recursion method, the Berends-Giele (BG) currents on the celestial sphere are worth studying. In this paper, we study the celestial BG recursion and utilize this to calculate some typical examples. We also explore the OPE behavior of celestial BG currents. Moreover, we generalize the \"sewing procedure\" for BG currents to the celestial case.",
