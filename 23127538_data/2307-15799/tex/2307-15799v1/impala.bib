abstract={Controlling the group velocity of an ultrashort laser pulse by means of spatio-temporal couplings has been proposed to overcome the inherent limitations in laser--plasma interactions. Here we report how this method improves the performance of a seeded soft X-ray laser (SXRL), which intrinsically suffers from group velocity mismatch between the infrared pump beam, used to generate the plasma amplifier, and the soft X-ray seed beam. The energy extraction was measured to be three times higher when the pump group velocity varied from 0.55c to 1.05c. We also demonstrate that the SXRL pulse duration is governed by the pump beam velocity. By compensating the natural group velocity mismatch, the SXRL pulse duration can be kept constant along its propagation, resulting in energetic pulses (up to 2{\thinspace}$\mu$J) as short as 350{\thinspace}fs. Such achievements constitute an experimental demonstration of the so-called `flying focus effect' in an application by controlling the group velocity of a high-intensity laser pulse propagating in a plasma.},

abstract = {Multicore fiber bundles are widely used in endoscopy due to their miniature size and their direct imaging capabilities. They have recently been used, in combination with spatial light modulators, in various realizations of endoscopy with little or no optics at the distal end. These schemes require characterization of the relative phase offsets between the different cores, typically done using off-axis holography, thus requiring both an interferometric setup and, typically, access to the distal tip. Here we explore the possibility of employing phase retrieval to extract the necessary phase information. We show that in the noise-free case, disordered fiber bundles are superior for phase retrieval over their periodic counterparts, and demonstrate experimentally accurate retrieval of phase information for up to 10 simultaneously illuminated cores. Thus, phase retrieval is presented as a viable alternative for real-time monitoring of phase distortions in multicore fiber bundles.},

The four-dimensional structure of a pulse-beam, E~(x,y,z,$\omega$), can be fully characterized by coupling spatiospectral metrology with spectral phase measurement. When temporal pulse dynamics are not of primary interest, spatiospectral characterization of a pulse-beam provides crucial information even without spectral phase. Here we demonstrate spatiospectral characterization of pulse-beams via multiplexed broadband ptychography. The complex spatial profiles of multiple spectral components, E~(x,y,$\omega$), from modelocked Ti:sapphire and from extreme ultra-violet pulse-beams are reconstructed with minimum intervening optics and no refocusing. Critically, our technique does not require spectral filters, interferometers, or reference pulses.},

abstract={Multispectral imaging has been used for numerous applications in e.g., environmental monitoring, aerospace, defense, and biomedicine. Here, we present a diffractive optical network-based multispectral imaging system trained using deep learning to create a virtual spectral filter array at the output image field-of-view. This diffractive multispectral imager performs spatially-coherent imaging over a large spectrum, and at the same time, routes a pre-determined set of spectral channels onto an array of pixels at the output plane, converting a monochrome focal-plane array or image sensor into a multispectral imaging device without any spectral filters or image recovery algorithms. Furthermore, the spectral responsivity of this diffractive multispectral imager is not sensitive to input polarization states. Through numerical simulations, we present different diffractive network designs that achieve snapshot multispectral imaging with 4, 9 and 16 unique spectral bands within the visible spectrum, based on passive spatially-structured diffractive surfaces, with a compact design that axially spans {\textasciitilde}72$\lambda$m, where $\lambda$m is the mean wavelength of the spectral band of interest. Moreover, we experimentally demonstrate a diffractive multispectral imager based on a 3D-printed diffractive network that creates at its output image plane a spatially repeating virtual spectral filter array with 2{\thinspace}{\texttimes}{\thinspace}2 = 4 unique bands at terahertz spectrum. Due to their compact form factor and computation-free, power-efficient and polarization-insensitive forward operation, diffractive multispectral imagers can be transformative for various imaging and sensing applications and be used at different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum where high-density and wide-area multispectral pixel arrays are not widely available.},

The method employs far-field interferometry and inverse Fourier transform spectroscopy, built on the theoretical basis derived in this paper. It stands out in its simplicity: it requires few non-standard optical elements and simple analysis algorithms. This method was used to measure the space-time intensity of our 100 TW class laser and to test the efficacy of a refractive doublet as a suppressor of pulse front curvature (PFC). The measured low-order STCs agreed with ray-tracing simulations. In addition, we demonstrate a one-shot measurement technique, derived from our central method, which allows for quick and precise alignment of the compressor by pulse front tilt minimization and for optimal refractive doublet positioning for the suppression of PFC.}

abstract={Femtosecond lasers are powerful in studying matter's ultrafast dynamics within femtosecond to attosecond time scales. Drawing a three-dimensional (3D) topological map of the optical field of a femtosecond laser pulse including its spatiotemporal amplitude and phase distributions, allows one to predict and understand the underlying physics of light interaction with matter, whose spatially resolved transient dielectric function experiences ultrafast evolution. However, such a task is technically challenging for two reasons: first, one has to capture in single-shot and squeeze the 3D information of an optical field profile into a two-dimensional (2D) detector; second, typical detectors are only sensitive to intensity or amplitude information rather than phase. Here we have demonstrated compressed optical field topography (COFT) drawing a 3D map for an ultrafast optical field in single-shot, by combining the coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI) technique with a global 3D phase retrieval procedure. COFT can, in single-shot, fully characterize the spatiotemporal coupling of a femtosecond laser pulse, and live stream the light-speed propagation of an air plasma ionization front, unveiling its potential applications in ultrafast sciences.},

We present a reference-free, full-field, single-shot spatiospectral measurement technique called broadband single-shot ptychography (BBSSP). BBSSP provides the complex wavefront for each spectral and polarization component in an ultrafast pulse-beam and should be applicable across the electromagnetic spectrum. BBSSP will dramatically improve the application and mitigation of spatiospectral pulse-beam structure.},

ABSTRACT = {In the past three decades, ultrafast pulse laser technology has greatly progressed and applied widely in many subjects, such as physics, chemistry, biology, materials, and so on. Accordingly, as well as for future developments, to measure or characterize the pulses temporally in femtosecond domain is indispensable but still challenging. Based on the operation principles, the measurement techniques can be classified into three categories: correlation, spectrogram, and spectral interferometry, which operate in time-domain, time-frequency combination, and frequency-domain, respectively. Here, we present a mini-review for these techniques, including their operating principles, development status, characteristics, and challenges.},

	abstract = {The temporal characterization of ultrafast laser pulses has become a cornerstone capability of ultrafast optics laboratories and is routine both for optimizing laser pulse duration and designing custom fields. Beyond pure temporal characterization, spatio-temporal characterization provides a more complete measurement of the spatially-varying temporal properties of a laser pulse. These so-called spatio-temporal couplings (STCs) are generally nonseparable chromatic aberrations that can be induced by very common optical elementsâ€”for example, diffraction gratings and thick lenses or prisms made from dispersive material. In this tutorial we introduce STCs and a detailed understanding of their behavior in order to have a background knowledge, but also to inform the design of characterization devices. We then overview a broad range of spatio-temporal characterization techniques with a view to mention most techniques, but also to provide greater details on a few chosen methods. The goal is to provide a reference and a comparison of various techniques for newcomers to the field. Lastly, we discuss nuances of analysis and visualization of spatio-temporal data, which is an often underappreciated and non-trivial part of ultrafast pulse characterization.}

abstract = {We present a method for characterizing ultrashort laser pulses in space and time, based on spatially resolved Fourier transform spectrometry. An unknown pulse is interfered with a delayed, spatially uniform reference on a CCD camera. The reference pulse is created by spatially filtering a portion of the unknown pulse. By scanning the delay between the two pulses, an interferogram is obtained at each pixel, allowing us to determine the spatially resolved phase difference between the unknown pulse and the reference pulse. High-resolution spatiotemporal characterization of an ultrashort pulse is demonstrated, and the sensitivity of the method to spatiotemporal coupling is shown for the case of a pulse with pulse front tilt.},

abstract = {An original method is proposed to calculate the formation of specified far-field intensity distributions by a bimorph mirror in the case of initial transverse-multimode beams. The method is based on the Gerchberg-{S}axton algorithm with replacement of the phase function in the plane of the control element by a function that takes into account both the intensity and phase distributions of each mode. The numerical results on the formation of a beam with the third-order super-Gaussian intensity distribution from beams composed of two or four lowest transverse modes are discussed. The experimental results on using the conventional Gerchberg-{S}axton algorithm to form a desired intensity distribution from single-mode laser beams using a liquid-crystal modulator are presented.}

abstract = {We show for the first time that ptychography (a form of lensless diffractive imaging) can recover the spectral response of an object through simultaneous reconstruction of multiple images that represent the object's response to a particular mode present in the illumination. We solve the phase problem for each mode independently, even though the intensity arriving at every detector pixel is an incoherent superposition of several uncorrelated diffracted waves. Until recently, the addition of incoherent modes has been seen as a nuisance in diffractive imaging: here we show that not only can the difficulties they pose be removed, but that they can also be used to discover much more information about the object. If the illumination function is also mode-specific, we show that we can also solve simultaneously for a multiplicity of such illumination modes. The work opens exciting possibilities for information multiplexing in ptychography over all visible, X-ray and electron wavelengths.}

abstract = {We report on a simple method allowing one to decompose the duration of arbitrary ultrashort light pulses, potentially distorted by space-time coupling, into four elementary durations. Such a decomposition shows that, in linear optics, a spatio-temporal pulse can be stretched with respect to its Fourier limit by only three independent phenomena: nonlinear frequency dependence of the spectral phase over the whole spatial extent of the pulse, spectral amplitude inhomogeneities in space, and spectral phase inhomogeneities in space. We illustrate such a decomposition using numerical simulations of complex spatio-temporal femtosecond and attosecond pulses. Finally we show that the contribution of two of these three effects to the pulse duration is measurable without any spectral phase characterization.},

In 2016, a femtosecond terawatt pulsed beam was experimentally reconstructed in the 3-dimensional (3D) space-time domain for the first time, and showing STC induced distortions. Referring to recently developed laser techniques, traditional first-order STCs can be controlled and then removed. However, the complex STC induced by wavefront errors in a meter-sized grating compressor, where the spatial and spectral coordinates of beams and pulses are coupled, would introduce a non-negligible and complicated distortion. Herein, we theoretically simulated this complex STC in the 3D space-time/spectrum domain and presented its evolution with various factors, which opens a new perspective to analyze CPA lasers in the 3D domain.},

	abstract = {Recently, several petawatt (PW, 1015 W) lasers with pulse duration of âˆ¼20â€“30 fs have been introduced throughout the world, pushing the upper limit on laser peak power. However, besides well-known spatio-temporal coupling effects, such as residual spatial/angular chirps and pulsefront tilt/curvature, the spatio-temporal/spectral coupling in compressors induced by wavefront errors of gratings, which could dramatically distort ultra-intense pulses, has been neglected. In this work, for the first time we analyzed this phenomenon and the peak power/intensity degradation induced by it. Our results suggest that the actual performance of femtosecond PW lasers may be worse than previously estimated.}

When such beams are focused in a vacuum, or in a linear medium, the interplay of these two effects can be exploited to set the velocity of the resulting intensity peak to arbitrary values within the Rayleigh length, i.e., precisely where laser pulses are generally used. Such beams could find groundbreaking applications in the control of laser\&\#x2013;matter interactions, in particular for laser-driven particle acceleration.},

abstract={The controlled coupling of a laser to plasma has the potential to address grand scientific challenges1--6, but many applications have limited flexibility and poor control over the laser focal volume. Here, we present an advanced focusing scheme called a `flying focus', where a chromatic focusing system combined with chirped laser pulses enables a small-diameter laser focus to propagate nearly 100 times its Rayleigh length. Furthermore, the speed at which the focus moves (and hence the peak intensity) is decoupled from the group velocity of the laser. It can co- or counter-propagate along the laser axis at any velocity. Experiments validating the concept measured subluminal (−0.09c) to superluminal (39c) focal-spot velocities, generating a nearly constant peak intensity over 4.5{\thinspace}mm. Among possible applications, the flying focus could be applied to a photon accelerator7to mitigate dephasing, facilitating the production of tunable XUV sources.},

Although, in the first case, the propagation was diffraction free, but with hardly controllable pulse velocities and limited to moderate intensities, in the second, high tunability was achieved, but with substantially lengthened pulse durations. Here we report a new concept that extends these approaches to relativistic intensities and ultrashort pulses by mixing spatio-temporal couplings and quasi-Bessel beams to independently control the light velocity and intensity. When used to drive a laser-plasma accelerator10, this concept leads to a new regime that is dephasing free, where the electron beam energy gain increases by more than one order of magnitude.},

Moreover, two representative ultra-high peak power femtosecond laser systems, featuring with 10 PW peak power/500 mm beam diameter/100 nm spectral width and 50 PW peak power/640 mm beam diameter/200 nm spectral width, are studied. For a drop of effective focused intensity smaller than 10{\%}, the numerical results show that the misalignment of gratings must be kept below{\thinspace}{\textasciitilde}{\thinspace}2 $\mu$rad and{\thinspace}{\textasciitilde}{\thinspace}1 $\mu$rad for aforesaid 10 PW and 50 PW lasers, respectively.
