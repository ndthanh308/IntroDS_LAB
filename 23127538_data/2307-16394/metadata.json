  "abstract": "A 2-distance $k$-coloring of a graph $G$ is a proper $k$-coloring such that any two vertices at distance two or less get different colors. The 2-distance chromatic number of $G$ is the minimum $k$ such that $G$ has a 2-distance $k$-coloring, denote as $χ_2(G)$. In this paper, we show that $χ_2(G) \\leq 17$ for every planar graph $G$ with maximum degree $Δ\\leq 5$, which improves a former bound $χ_2(G) \\leq 18$.",
