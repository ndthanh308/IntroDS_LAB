  "abstract": "The two-dimensional motion of an object on a moving rough horizontal plane is investigated. Two cases are studied: the plane having a translational acceleration, and a rotating plane. For the first case, the motions of a point particle and a sphere are studied, and it is shown that the solution to the latter problem can be expressed in terms of the solution to the former one. Examples of constant acceleration and periodic acceleration along a fixed line, and specifically sinusoidal acceleration along a fixed line, are studied in more detail. Also a situation is investigated where the friction is anisotropic, that is the friction coefficient depends on the direction of the velocity. In this situation, there may be stick-slip motions, and these are investigated in detail. For the second case, the motion of a point particle on a rough turntable is investigated.",
