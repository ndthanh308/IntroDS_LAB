  "abstract": "We consider minimization problems with the well-known Polya-Lojasievich condition and Lipshitz-continuous gradient. Such problem occurs in different places in machine learning and related fields. Furthermore, we assume that a gradient is available with some relative inexactness. We propose some adaptive gradient-type algorithm, where the adaptivity took place with respect to the smoothness parameter and the level of the gradient inexactness. The theoretical estimate of the the quality of the output point is obtained and backed up by experimental results.",
