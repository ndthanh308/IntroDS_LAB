	Abstract = {The promise of quantum computers is that certain computational tasks might be executed exponentially faster on a quantum processor than on a classical processor1. A fundamental challenge is to build a high-fidelity processor capable of running quantum algorithms in an exponentially large computational space. Here we report the use of a processor with programmable superconducting qubits2--7 to create quantum states on 53 qubits, corresponding to a computational state-space of dimension 253 (about 1016). Measurements from repeated experiments sample the resulting probability distribution, which we verify using classical simulations. Our Sycamore processor takes about 200 seconds to sample one instance of a quantum circuit a million times---our benchmarks currently indicate that the equivalent task for a state-of-the-art classical supercomputer would take approximately 10,000 years. This dramatic increase in speed compared to all known classical algorithms is an experimental realization of quantum supremacy8--14 for this specific computational task, heralding a much-anticipated computing paradigm.},

	Abstract = {Many-body open quantum systems balance internal dynamics against decoherence and measurements induced by interactions with an environment1,2. Quantum circuits composed of random unitary gates with interspersed projective measurements represent a minimal model to study the balance between unitary dynamics and measurement processes3--5. As the measurement rate is varied, a purification phase transition is predicted to emerge at a critical point akin to a fault-tolerant threshold6. Here we explore this purification transition with random quantum circuits implemented on a trapped-ion quantum computer. We probe the pure phase, where the system is rapidly projected to a pure state conditioned on the measurement outcomes, and the mixed or coding phase, where the initial state becomes partially encoded into a quantum error correcting codespace that keeps the memory of initial conditions for long times6,7. We find experimental evidence of the two phases and show numerically that, with modest system scaling, critical properties of the transition emerge.},

@article{midcircuitMIPT,
	Abstract = {Quantum many-body systems subjected to unitary evolution with the addition of interspersed measurements exhibit a variety of dynamical phases that do not occur under pure unitary evolution. However, these systems remain challenging to investigate on near-term quantum hardware owing to the need for numerous ancilla qubits or repeated high-fidelity mid-circuit measurements, a capability that has only recently become available. Here we report the realization of a measurement-induced entanglement phase transition with a hybrid random circuit on up to 14 superconducting qubits with mid-circuit readout capability. We directly observe extensive and sub-extensive scaling of entanglement entropy in the volume- and area-law phases, respectively, by varying the rate of the measurements. We also demonstrate phenomenological critical behaviour by performing a data collapse of the measured entanglement entropy. Our work establishes the use of mid-circuit measurement as a powerful resource for quantum simulation on near-term quantum computers.},

    abstract = { Quantum circuits—built from local unitary gates and local measurements—are a new playground for quantum many-body physics and a tractable setting to explore universal collective phenomena far from equilibrium. These models have shed light on longstanding questions about thermalization and chaos, and on the underlying universal dynamics of quantum information and entanglement. In addition, such models generate new sets of questions and give rise to phenomena with no traditional analog, such as dynamical phase transitions in quantum systems that are monitored by an external observer. Quantum circuit dynamics is also topical in view of experimental progress in building digital quantum simulators that allow control of precisely these ingredients. Randomness in the circuit elements allows a high level of theoretical control, with a key theme being mappings between real-time quantum dynamics and effective classical lattice models or dynamical processes. Many of the universal phenomena that can be identified in this tractable setting apply to much wider classes of more structured many-body dynamics. }

We draw attention to a precise determination of magnetic scaling dimensions in order to compare with perturbative results. Universality is checked by the computation of the spin–spin correlation function decay exponent obtained with different types of probability distributions of the coupling strengths. Our numerical data, compared to perturbative results for the second moment of the correlation function, obtained with both replica symmetry and replica symmetry breaking schemes, are conclusively in favour of the replica symmetric calculations. The multifractal behaviour of higher moments as well as that of typical correlation functions are also investigated and a comparison is made with the perturbative expansions. Finally, the shape of the correlation function probability distribution is analyzed.}

abstract = {In analogy with other spatially inhomogeneous, scale invariant systems (strange attractors, diffusion limited aggregation, Anderson localization, random resistor networks,…) we propose a description of the scaling properties of local operators ψ(r) (e.g. local spin or energy density) at the critical point of a quenched diluted ferromagnet by universal convex functions Hψ(α) [the analog of ƒ(α)], generalizing exponents. Using the random 2D q-state Potts model as a typical example of a random ferromagnet we illustrate that this is an appropriate description of random criticality, hence rather different from pure critical phenomena. The infinite set ηN = 2XN(σ) = 2N[xσ−116(N−1)y + O(y2)] of independent exponents of the moments of the Potts spin (scaling dimension xσ without disorder) correlation function is obtained to 1 loop. [y is the RG eigenvalue of disorder causing the RG flow from the pure to the random Potts fixed point, nearby when y ∝ (q−2) is small.] From this the perturbative expression Hσ(α) = (12yB2){(α−α0)2−[B3/(B2)2](α−α0)3 + O((α−α0)4)} is inferred by Legendre transformation. Its minimum α0 = xσ+116y+O(y2) is a new exponent describing the asymptotic decay of the spin-spin correlation function in a fixed sample at criticality. Using the conformal map onto the cylinder it is shown (for q close to 2) to be universally related to the finite size scaling amplitude Aσ of the spin correlation length in the critical disorder d cylinder α0 = Aσ/2π. In general, multiplicatively renormalizable operators at random criticality should be classified by irreducible representations of the permutation group of the replicas. Moments of the Potts energy are shown to correspond to non-singlet representations under permutations. For the 2D random Ising model at the transition non-self-averaging logarithmic corrections to all moments of the spin correlation function are derived. The averaged spin correlation function is shown to be equal to the correlation function in the critical pure Ising Model at large distance.}

This problem is equivalent to determining the effect of a relevant perturbation on finite size scaling of the free energy on a strip. Corrections to scaling of the free energy are computed for small perturbations from the new fixed point. Conditions for the applicability of the Kac formula at the new critical point are derived. The results are used to explain the way the relevant operators change position in the conformal grid in the series of Z2-multicritical points in the Andrews, Baxter and Forrester models. For the random and replicated q-state Potts models the conformal anomaly is obtained perturbatively in q − 2; it is shown that the scaling dimension of the random energy operator cannot be obtained from the Kac formula for general q near 2; modular invariance is shown to imply an infinite operator product algebra and negative multiplicities. The finite-size correction to the conformal anomaly and of the energy correlation length of the random Ising model in strips is obtained.}

abstract = {A new definition of order called topological order is proposed for two-dimensional systems in which no long-range order of the conventional type exists. The possibility of a phase transition characterized by a change in the response of the system to an external perturbation is discussed in the context of a mean field type of approximation. The critical behaviour found in this model displays very weak singularities. The application of these ideas to the xy model of magnetism, the solid-liquid transition, and the neutral superfluid are discussed. This type of phase transition cannot occur in a superconductor nor in a Heisenberg ferromagnet.}

Using micro-mirrors fabricated with micro-electromechanical systems technology, we focus laser beams on individual ions in a linear chain and steer the focal point in two dimensions. We demonstrate sequential single qubit gates on multiple 171Yb+ qubits and characterize the gate performance using quantum state tomography. Our system features negligible crosstalk to neighboring ions (\\&lt;3×10−4), and switching speed comparable to typical single qubit gate times (\\&lt;2 μs).}",
