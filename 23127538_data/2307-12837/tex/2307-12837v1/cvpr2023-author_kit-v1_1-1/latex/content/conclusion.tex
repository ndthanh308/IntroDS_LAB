In conclusion, this report presents our sequential approach to the EPIC-Kitchens-100 unsupervised domain adaptation challenge. We propose a mixed sequence strategy to improve the transferability of our model across domains. Furthermore, we leverage a language model and co-occurrence matrix to integrate contextual information by filtering out improbable combinations of verbs and nouns. Through these techniques, our model achieves significant performance improvements.
