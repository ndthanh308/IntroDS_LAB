  "abstract": "Let $G \\curvearrowright A$ be an action of a discrete group on a unital $C^*$-algebra by $*$-automorphisms. In this note, we give two sufficient dynamical conditions for the $C^*$-inclusion $A \\subseteq A \\rtimes_r G$ to be norming in the sense of Pop, Sinclair, and Smith. As a consequence of our results, when $A$ is separable or simple, the inclusion $A \\subseteq A \\rtimes_r G$ is norming provided it has a unique pseudo-expectation in the sense of Pitts.",
