abstract = {Abstract Optical multidimensional coherent spectroscopy (MDCS) is a nonlinear spectroscopy technique where a material is excited by a series of laser pulses to produce a spectrum as a function of multiple frequencies. The technique's ability to elucidate excited-state structure and interactions has made MDCS a valuable tool in the study of excitons in semiconductors. This review introduces the method and describes progress it has fostered establishing a better understanding of dephasing rates, coherent coupling mechanisms, and many-body interactions pertaining to optically generated electronic excitations in a variety of semiconductor material systems. Emphasis is placed on nanostructured gallium arsenide quantum wells and quantum dots, on quantum dots in other III–V and II–VI semiconductors, and on atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides. Recent technical advances and potential future directions in the field are also discussed.},

abstract = {A novel type of Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR) is demonstrated. It is based on two Ti:sapphire lasers emitting femtosecond pulse trains with slightly different repetition frequencies. Two mid-infrared beams---derived from those lasers by rectification in GaSe---are superimposed upon a detector to produce purely time-domain interferograms that encode the infrared spectrum. The advantages of this spectrometer compared with the common FTIR include ease of operation (no moving parts), speed of acquisition (100 {\textmu}s demonstrated), and not-yet-shown collimated long-distance propagation, diffraction-limited microscopic probing, and electronically controllable chemometric factoring. Extending time-domain frequency-comb spectroscopy to lower (terahertz) or higher (visible, ultraviolet) frequencies should be feasible.},

journal = {Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics},
abstract = {The ability to resolve the complete electric field of laser pulses from terahertz to mid-infrared spectral ranges has enriched time-domain spectroscopy for decades. Field-resolved measurements in this range have been performed routinely in ambient air by various techniques like electro-optic sampling, photoconductive switching, field-induced second harmonic generation, and time stretch photonics. On the contrary, resolving the electric field of light at the near-infrared spectral range has been limited to attosecond streaking and other techniques that require operation in vacuum. Recent advances are circumventing these shortcomings and extending the direct, ambient air field detection of light to petahertz frequencies. In the first part of this letter, recent field-resolved techniques are reviewed. In the second part, different approaches for temporal scanning are discussed, as the temporal resolution of the time-domain methods is prone to temporal jitter. The review concludes by discussing technological obstacles and emerging applications of such advancements.}

abstract={A laser frequency comb is a broad spectrum composed of equidistant narrow lines. Initially invented for frequency metrology, such combs enable new approaches to spectroscopy over broad spectral bandwidths, of particular relevance to molecules. The performance of existing spectrometers --- such as crossed dispersers employing, for example, virtual imaging phase array {\'e}talons, or Michelson-based Fourier transform interferometers --- can be dramatically enhanced with optical frequency combs. A new class of instruments, such as dual-comb spectrometers without moving parts, enables fast and accurate measurements over broad spectral ranges. The direct self-calibration of the frequency scale of the spectra within the accuracy of an atomic clock and the negligible contribution of the instrumental line-shape will enable determinations of all spectral parameters with high accuracy for stringent comparisons with theories in atomic and molecular physics. Chip-scale frequency comb spectrometers promise integrated devices for real-time sensing in analytical chemistry and biomedicine. This Review gives a summary of the developments in the emerging and rapidly advancing field of atomic and molecular broadband spectroscopy with frequency combs.},

Using an interferometer based on two frequency combs13--15 of slightly different repetition frequencies and a lensless camera sensor, we record time-varying spatial interference patterns that generate spectral hypercubes of complex holograms, revealing the amplitudes and phases of scattered wave-fields for each comb line frequency. Advancing beyond multicolour holography and low-coherence holography (including with a frequency comb16), the synergy of broad spectral bandwidth and high temporal coherence in dual-comb holography opens up novel optical diagnostics, such as precise dimensional metrology over large distances without interferometric phase ambiguity, or hyperspectral three-dimensional imaging with high spectral resolving power, as we demonstrate with molecule-selective imaging of an absorbing gas.},

In time-domain waveforms, the main-peak of water vapor delayed 0.3ps with very large attenuation compared with reference. In the transmittance spectra, seven atmospheric windows obtained indicate that terahertz wave will be able to propagate in quite a long distance at atmosphere. Experiment date and first principles calculation results described gallium phosphide crystal could be useful for terahertz frequency selector based on acousto-optic interaction. We obtained 30 absorption lines in the absorption spectra and the four locations of radical groups are characteristic absorption peaks.}

Such vacuum or quantum fluctuations are known to exist, but evidence for them has been indirect. Riek et al. present an ultrafast optical based technique that probes the vacuum fluctuation of electromagnetic radiation directly. Science, this issue p. 420 Ultrafast optics can directly probe the electric-field vacuum fluctuations. The ground state of quantum systems is characterized by zero-point motion. This motion, in the form of vacuum fluctuations, is generally considered to be an elusive phenomenon that manifests itself only indirectly. Here, we report direct detection of the vacuum fluctuations of electromagnetic radiation in free space. The ground-state electric-field variance is inversely proportional to the four-dimensional space-time volume, which we sampled electro-optically with tightly focused laser pulses lasting a few femtoseconds. Subcycle temporal readout and nonlinear coupling far from resonance provide signals from purely virtual photons without amplification. Our findings enable an extreme time-domain approach to quantum physics, with nondestructive access to the quantum state of light. Operating at multiterahertz frequencies, such techniques might also allow time-resolved studies of intrinsic fluctuations of elementary excitations in condensed matter.}}

The frequencies of these signature molecular modes, however, lie in a region where accurate spectroscopic measurements are extremely difficult because of the lack of efficient detectors and spectrometers. Here, we show that, with a combination of advanced ultrafast technologies and nonlinear-optical waveform characterization, time-domain techniques can be advantageously extended to the metrology of fundamental molecular motions in the mid-infrared. In our scheme, the spectral modulation of ultrashort mid-infrared pulses, induced by rovibrational motions of molecules, gives rise to interfering coherent dark waveforms in the time domain. These high-visibility interference patterns can be read out by cross-correlation frequency-resolved gating of the field in the visible generated through ultrabroadband four-wave mixing in a gas phase.},

abstract = {We experimentally demonstrate compressed time-domain coherent Raman spectroscopy with real-time random sampling. Specifically, we employ Fourier-transform coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering as a platform for the spectroscopy and demonstrate reconstruction of Raman spectra from sparsely sampled time-domain interferograms using the iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm. We show that Raman spectra reconstructed at compression ratios down to 0.3 retain the quality of a fully sampled Raman spectrum. We also verify this performance with multiple molecules to demonstrate its versatility. Advantages of our method include data volume reduction, signal acquisition time reduction, and alleviated requirements for measurement instruments. © 2019 Optical Society of America.}

abstract = {Ultrafast spectroscopy would be an ideal characterization technique for many scientific and industrial applications if only it weren’t so slow. To accurately characterize a given sample, thousands of time-consuming individual measurements must usually be made, adding up to a process that can take minutes or even hours. But what if we could forgo most of these measurements without compromising the technique’s reliability? This solution may seem too good to be true, but it is one that has now been demonstrated by Sushovit Adhikari at the Argonne National Laboratory, Illinois, and colleagues. The team applied an algorithmic approach called compressive sensing (CS) to two ultrafast spectroscopy techniques, reducing their measurement time by a factor of 6 [1]. This improvement may make a new range of condensed-matter experiments more broadly accessible. It could also bring cutting-edge optical technologies closer to industrial applications, especially in the field of product quality control.}

abstract={The proper functioning of living systems and physiological phenotypes depends on molecular composition. Yet simultaneous quantitative detection of a wide variety of molecules remains a challenge1--8. Here we show how broadband optical coherence opens up opportunities for fingerprinting complex molecular ensembles in their natural environment. Vibrationally excited molecules emit a coherent electric field following few-cycle infrared laser excitation9--12, and this field is specific to the sample's molecular composition. Employing electro-optic sampling10,12--15, we directly measure this global molecular fingerprint down to field strengths 107 times weaker than that of the excitation. This enables transillumination of intact living systems with thicknesses of the order of 0.1 millimetres, permitting broadband infrared spectroscopic probing of human cells and plant leaves. In a proof-of-concept analysis of human blood serum, temporal isolation of the infrared electric-field fingerprint from its excitation along with its sampling with attosecond timing precision results in detection sensitivity of submicrograms per millilitre of blood serum and a detectable dynamic range of molecular concentration exceeding 105. This technique promises improved molecular sensitivity and molecular coverage for probing complex, real-world biological and medical settings.},

abstract = {Generation and detection of single-cycle mid-infrared waveforms enables broadband, high-resolution spectroscopy across 3 to 27 μm. Probing matter with light in the mid-infrared provides unique insight into molecular composition, structure, and function with high sensitivity. However, laser spectroscopy in this spectral region lacks the broadband or tunable light sources and efficient detectors available in the visible or near-infrared. We overcome these challenges with an approach that unites a compact source of phase-stable, single-cycle, mid-infrared pulses with room temperature electric field–resolved detection at video rates. The ultrashort pulses correspond to laser frequency combs that span 3 to 27 μm (370 to 3333 cm−1), and are measured with dynamic range of \&gt;106 and spectral resolution as high as 0.003 cm−1. We highlight the brightness and coherence of our apparatus with gas-, liquid-, and solid-phase spectroscopy that extends over spectral bandwidths comparable to thermal or infrared synchrotron sources. This unique combination enables powerful avenues for rapid detection of biological, chemical, and physical properties of matter with molecular specificity.}}

    abstract = { The time-frequency and time-scale communities have recently developed a large number of overcomplete waveform dictionaries---stationary wavelets, wavelet packets, cosine packets, chirplets, and warplets, to name a few. Decomposition into overcomplete systems is not unique, and several methods for decomposition have been proposed, including the method of frames (MOF), matching pursuit (MP), and, for special dictionaries, the best orthogonal basis (BOB).Basis pursuit (BP) is a principle for decomposing a signal into an "optimal"' superposition of dictionary elements, where optimal means having the smallest l1 norm of coefficients among all such decompositions. We give examples exhibiting several advantages over MOF, MP, and BOB, including better sparsity and superresolution. BP has interesting relations to ideas in areas as diverse as ill-posed problems, abstract harmonic analysis, total variation denoising, and multiscale edge denoising.BP in highly overcomplete dictionaries leads to large-scale optimization problems. With signals of length 8192 and a wavelet packet dictionary, one gets an equivalent linear program of size 8192 by 212,992. Such problems can be attacked successfully only because of recent advances in linear and quadratic programming by interior-point methods. We obtain reasonable success with a primal-dual logarithmic barrier method and conjugate-gradient solver. }

              resonating at 19 kHz (forward and backward acquisition at 38
              kHz). The instrument records the infrared waveform with a

              single scan over a 1.6-ps delay range, acquired within 26 $\mu$s.
              The purely reflective nature of the delay scanning technique is
              compatible with broad optical bandwidths, short pulse durations

Outliers are the patterns which are not in the range of normal behavior. Outliers in the dataset produce more false positive alarms, and this has to be reduced to increase the efficiency of IDS. We have used Interquartile Range technique to identify the outliers in the NSLKDD'99. In this, the continuous range of input is divided into quartiles and these quartiles are analyzed to target the range of outliers.

               School while they (control and treatment groups) were exposed to
               the conventional manner of instruction (modules and video
               lessons) and gamified instruction, in the form of the
               ChemiCooking e-game, for the school year 2021-2022. Data were
               gathered using a researcher-made instrument: a pre-test, a
               post-test, and a checklist of student's learning experiences.
               The quantitative data were subjected to various statistical
               analyses, specifically the mean, standard deviation, and t-tests
               of the pre and post-tests scores. Moreover, the qualitative data
               were transcribed, analyzed, and thematized. The findings and
               results of the study indicated that the control and treatment
               groups' pretest scores were not significantly different from
               those of the control and treatment groups. Furthermore, results
               showed that the post-test scores significantly differ, as
               reflected in their mean scores of 10.15 (sd=3.88) and 14.7
               (sd=4.84). The difference in mean and standard deviation between
               the control and treatment group's gain scores speak of the
               effectiveness of the ChemiCooking mobile e-game as an
               instructional material. Moreover, there is a significant
               difference in the knowledge gained by the control group
               (unexposed to the ChemiCoooking e-game) and treatment group
               (exposed to the ChemiCooking e-game) based on their respective
               post-test scores and gain scores, with the treatment group
               performing better. This leads to the conclusion that gamified
               intervention (ChemiCooking) is way more effective than the
               conventional delivery of instruction. The learners exposed to
               the ChemiCooking e-game have different and meaningful learning
