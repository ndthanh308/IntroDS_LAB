  abstract  = "This research study sought to document the different learning
               experiences of the Grade 11 students of Santa Fe National High
               School while they (control and treatment groups) were exposed to
               the conventional manner of instruction (modules and video
               lessons) and gamified instruction, in the form of the
               ChemiCooking e-game, for the school year 2021-2022. Data were
               gathered using a researcher-made instrument: a pre-test, a
               post-test, and a checklist of student's learning experiences.
               The quantitative data were subjected to various statistical
               analyses, specifically the mean, standard deviation, and t-tests
               of the pre and post-tests scores. Moreover, the qualitative data
               were transcribed, analyzed, and thematized. The findings and
               results of the study indicated that the control and treatment
               groups' pretest scores were not significantly different from
               those of the control and treatment groups. Furthermore, results
               showed that the post-test scores significantly differ, as
               reflected in their mean scores of 10.15 (sd=3.88) and 14.7
               (sd=4.84). The difference in mean and standard deviation between
               the control and treatment group's gain scores speak of the
               effectiveness of the ChemiCooking mobile e-game as an
               instructional material. Moreover, there is a significant
               difference in the knowledge gained by the control group
               (unexposed to the ChemiCoooking e-game) and treatment group
               (exposed to the ChemiCooking e-game) based on their respective
               post-test scores and gain scores, with the treatment group
               performing better. This leads to the conclusion that gamified
               intervention (ChemiCooking) is way more effective than the
               conventional delivery of instruction. The learners exposed to
               the ChemiCooking e-game have different and meaningful learning
               experiences. Keywords: gamification, knowledge gain,
               intervention material, ChemiCooking, e-game",

abstract="Unpredictable usage of Internet adds more problems to the network. Protecting the system from the anomalous behavior plays a major issue in NIDS. Data mining approaches in the field of Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is becoming more popular. The outlier is a current problem faced by many data mining researches. Outliers are the patterns which are not in the range of normal behavior. Outliers in the dataset produce more false positive alarms, and this has to be reduced to increase the efficiency of IDS. We have used Interquartile Range technique to identify the outliers in the NSLKDD'99. In this, the continuous range of input is divided into quartiles and these quartiles are analyzed to target the range of outliers. Then the obtained outliers are removed by a filter called remove with value. The experiment is conducted using Weka data mining tool.",
