  "abstract": "Let $X/K$ be a smooth projective variety defined over a number field, and let $f:X\\to{X}$ be a morphism defined over $K$. We formulate a number of statements of varying strengths asserting, roughly, that if there is at least one point $P_0\\in{X(K)}$ whose $f$-orbit $\\mathcal{O}_f(P_0):=\\bigl\\{f^n(P):n\\in\\mathbb{N}\\bigr\\}$ is Zariski dense, then there are many such points. For example, a weak conclusion would be that $X(K)$ is not the union of finitely many (grand) $f$-orbits, while a strong conclusion would be that any set of representatives for the Zariski dense grand $f$-orbits is Zariski dense. We prove statements of this sort for various classes of varieties and maps, including projective spaces, abelian varieties, and surfaces.",
