  "abstract": "In this paper we propose a numerical method to solve a 2D advection-diffusion equation, in the highly oscillatory regime. We use an efficient and robust integrator which leads to an accurate approximation of the solution without any time step-size restriction. Uniform first and second order numerical approximations in time are obtained with errors, and at a cost, that are independent of the oscillation frequency. {This work is part of a long time project, and the final goal is the resolution of a Stokes-advection-diffusion system, in which the expression for the velocity in the advection term, is the solution of the Stokes equations.} This paper focuses on the time multiscale challenge, coming from the velocity that is an $\\varepsilon-$periodic function, whose expression is explicitly known. We also introduce a two--scale formulation, as a first step to the numerical resolution of the complete oscillatory Stokes-advection-diffusion system, that is currently under investigation. This two--scale formulation is also useful to understand the asymptotic behaviour of the solution.",
