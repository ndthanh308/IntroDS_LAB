abstract = {Systematic investigations of self-regulation of evaporating menisci in nanochannels are conducted as a function of the surface wettability under various applied heat flux conditions. The simulation system is designed to result in steady-state response so that a stable meniscus region can be produced. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations are performed for argon fluid in platinum channels. Depending on the surface wettability and the applied heat flux the meniscus can be in the pinned regime or it can recede inside the channel. Adsorbed layer formation becomes evident for the latter case. Higher wettability enables the formation of a thicker adsorbed layer reducing the radius of curvature of the meniscus and the overall evaporation rate in the channel. Adsorbed layer reduces the thermal resistance of the evaporator, providing a higher critical heat flux. While evaporation from the adsorbed layer is negligible for macroscopic systems, it can contribute up to 80\% of the total evaporating mass in nanoscale systems. The current work provides insights into the capillary-driven thin-film evaporation in ultra-small channels and the findings are meaningful for next-generation thermal management systems.}

    abstract = { We report a detailed study of the main structural and dynamical features of water confined in model Lennard–Jones nanopores with tunable hydrophobicity and finite length (L=26 Å). The generic model of cylindrical confinement used is able to reproduce the wetting features of a large class of technologically and biologically relevant systems spanning from crystalline nanoporous materials, to mesoporous silica and ion channels. The aim of this work is to discuss the influence of parameters such as wall hydrophobicity, temperature, and pore size on the structural and dynamical features of confined water. Our simulation campaign confirmed the existence of a core domain in which water displays bulk-like structural features even in extreme (R=7.0Å) confinement, while dynamical properties were shown to depend non-trivially on the size and hydrophobicity of the pores. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Progress in mesoscale methods for fluid dynamics simulation’. }

abstract = {We investigate the moving contact line problem for two-phase incompressible flows with a kinematic approach. The key idea is to derive an evolution equation for the contact angle in terms of the transporting velocity field. It turns out that the resulting equation has a simple structure and expresses the time derivative of the contact angle in terms of the velocity gradient at the solid wall. Together with the additionally imposed boundary conditions for the velocity, it yields a more specific form of the contact angle evolution. Thus, the kinematic evolution equation is a tool to analyze the evolution of the contact angle. Since the transporting velocity field is required only on the moving interface, the kinematic evolution equation also applies when the interface moves with its own velocity independent of the fluid velocity. We apply the developed tool to a class of moving contact line models which employ the Navier slip boundary condition. We derive an explicit form of the contact angle evolution for sufficiently regular solutions, showing that such solutions are unphysical. Within the simplest model, this rigorously shows that the contact angle can only relax to equilibrium if some kind of singularity is present at the contact line. Moreover, we analyze more general models including surface tension gradients at the contact line, slip at the fluid–fluid interface and mass transfer across the fluid–fluid interface.}

abstract={Wetting phenomena, i.e. the spreading of a liquid over a dry solid surface, are important for understanding how plants and insects imbibe water and moisture and for miniaturization in chemistry and biotechnology, among other examples. They pose fundamental challenges and possibilities, especially in dynamic situations. The surface chemistry and micro-scale roughness may determine the macroscopic spreading flow. The question here is how dynamic wetting depends on the topography of the substrate, i.e. the actual geometry of the roughness elements. To this end, we have formulated a toy model that accounts for the roughness shape, which is tested against a series of spreading experiments made on asymmetric sawtooth surface structures. The spreading speed in different directions relative to the surface pattern is found to be well described by the toy model. The toy model also shows the mechanism by which the shape of the roughness together with the line friction determines the observed slowing down of the spreading.},

abstract={Glycerol is used in many applications of science and daily life as it is cheap and biologically non-invasive. In science, aqueous solutions of glycerol are commonly used for experimental investigations as their density can be adapted by changing the glycerol content in the solution. Although the density of aqueous glycerol solutions has been measured precisely since more than a century, current models show a deviation from measured data of up to {\$}{\$}2{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}. In this work we present an analytical expression to accurately calculate the density of aqueous glycerol solutions. The presented empirical model is validated in the range between 15 and {\$}{\$}30{\backslash},^{\backslash}circ {\{}{\backslash}text {\{}C{\}}{\}}{\$}{\$}and has a maximum deviation of less than {\$}{\$}0.07{\backslash}{\%}{\$}{\$}with respect to measured data. This improves the accuracy of current models by more than one order of magnitude. By knowing the temperature and glycerol content of the solution, its density can be simply calculated with the presented model. A Matlab function is provided in the supplementary material to allow a simple implementation in other scientific work.},

abstract={Nanometre-scale features with special shapes impart a broad spectrum of unique properties to the surface of insects. These properties are essential for the animal's survival, and include the low light reflectance of moth eyes, the oil repellency of springtail carapaces and the ultra-adhesive nature of palmtree bugs. Antireflective mosquito eyes and cicada wings are also known to exhibit some antifogging and self-cleaning properties. In all cases, the combination of small feature size and optimal shape provides exceptional surface properties. In this work, we investigate the underlying antifogging mechanism in model materials designed to mimic natural systems, and explain the importance of the texture's feature size and shape. While exposure to fog strongly compromises the water-repellency of hydrophobic structures, this failure can be minimized by scaling the texture down to nanosize. This undesired effect even becomes non-measurable if the hydrophobic surface consists of nanocones, which generate antifogging efficiency close to unity and water departure of droplets smaller than 2{\thinspace}$\mu$m.},

abstract = {Dynamic wetting is an important interfacial phenomenon in many industrial applications. There have been many excellent reviews of dynamic wetting, especially on super-hydrophobic surfaces with physical or chemical coatings, porous layers, hybrid micro/nano structures and biomimetic structures. This review summarizes recent research on dynamic wetting from the viewpoint of the fluids rather than the solid surfaces. The reviewed fluids range from simple Newtonian fluids to non-Newtonian fluids and complex nanofluids. The fundamental physical concepts and principles involved in dynamic wetting phenomena are also reviewed. This review focus on recent investigations of dynamic wetting by non-Newtonian fluids, including the latest experimental studies with a thorough review of the best dynamic wetting models for non-Newtonian fluids, to illustrate their successes and limitations. This paper also reports on new results on the still fledgling field of nanofluid wetting kinetics. The challenges of research on nanofluid dynamic wetting is not only due to the lack of nanoscale experimental techniques to probe the complex nanoparticle random motion, but also the lack of multiscale experimental techniques or theories to describe the effects of nanoparticle motion at the nanometer scale (10-9 m) on the dynamic wetting taking place at the macroscopic scale (10-3 m). This paper describes the various types of nanofluid dynamic wetting behaviors. Two nanoparticle dissipation modes, the bulk dissipation mode and the local dissipation mode, are proposed to resolve the uncertainties related to the various types of dynamic wetting mechanisms reported in the literature.}

A useful idealization of liquid transfer is a liquid bridge with moving contact lines being deformed between two separating surfaces. The fluid mechanics of such bridges are relevant not only to printing, but also to other important applications, such as adhesion, tribology, biology, oil recovery, and microfluidics. }

We calibrate the interactions of each species present in the system using dedicated criteria such as the contact angle of a water droplet on a silica surface, and the solubility of air in water at different pressures. Using the calibrated force field, we conduct MD simulations to study the interface between a hydrophilic silica substrate and water surrounded by air at different pressures. We find that the static water contact angle is independent of the air pressure imposed on the system. Our simulations reveal the presence of a nanometer thick layer of gas at the water–silica interface. We believe that this gas layer could promote nucleation and stabilization of surface nanobubbles at amorphous silica surfaces.}

    abstract = { The speed at which a liquid can move over a solid surface is strongly limited when a three-phase contact line is present, separating wet from dry regions. When enforcing large contact line speeds, this leads to the entrainment of drops, films, or air bubbles. In this review, we discuss experimental and theoretical progress revealing the physical mechanisms behind these dynamical wetting transitions. In this context, we discuss microscopic processes that have been proposed to resolve the moving–contact line paradox and identify the different dynamical regimes of contact line motion. }

Surprisingly{,} we find that atomic displacements at the Angstrom scale are sufficient to remove the divergence of the slip length and realize the no-slip condition.

Physical properties, commonly needed in studies of multiphase flow in porous media, are reported for aqueous solutions of glycerol. They include density, surface tension (against air), interfacial tension (against three types of refined oil), contact angle (against n-decane), and viscosity. Experimental results were obtained at six temperatures (20, 30, 40, 50, 65 and 80°C) and five levels of ionic strength of the brine used for adjusting the glycerol/brine mixture. Contact angle measurements against n-decane were made at 20 and 60°C. Glycerol is miscible with water at all investigated salinities and temperature levels. Density and surface and interfacial tensions against refined oils are very close-to-linear with respect to weight fraction of glycerol. Aqueous glycerol solutions on quartz surfaces exhibited zero contact angle (perfect wetting) against both air and refined oil. Increase in viscosity of glycerol–water mixtures with addition of glycerol is highly non-linear. All viscosity data were fitted exceptionally well by an equation originally developed for colloidal dispersions. Literature data on vapor pressure, refractive index and viscosity are also presented.}

	abstract = {Dynamic wetting of a solid surface is a process that is ubiquitous in Nature, and also of increasing technological importance. The underlying dissipative mechanisms are, however, still unclear. We present here short-time dynamic wetting experiments and numerical simulations, based on a phase field approach, of a droplet on a dry solid surface, where direct comparison of the two allows us to evaluate the different contributions from the numerics. We find that an important part of the dissipation may arise from a friction related to the motion of the contact line itself, and that this may be dominating both inertia and viscous friction in the flow adjacent to the contact line. A contact line friction factor appears in the theoretical formulation that can be distinguished and quantified, also in room temperature where other sources of dissipation are present. Water and glycerin-water mixtures on various surfaces have been investigated where we show the dependency of the friction factor on the nature of the surface, and the viscosity of the liquid.}

  abstract = {In this paper, molecular dynamics simulations of a simple
              Lennard-Jones fluid confined in narrow slit pores and undergoing
              shear have been performed. The aim is to investigate the effects
              of density inhomogeneities at the fluid-solid interfaces on the
              shear viscosity profiles. It has been found that the local
              viscosity was varying strongly with the distance from the solid
              walls for both dilute and dense fluid states with oscillations
              correlated to the density ones. To describe the computed
              viscosity profiles, we propose a scheme that uses the local
              average density model, combined with an adequate weight function,
              for the configurational viscosity and a semiempirical model for
              the translational viscosity. It is shown that the proposed

abstract = {Understanding and predicting the behavior of water, especially in contact with various surfaces, is a scientific challenge. Molecular-level understanding of hydrophobic effects and their macroscopic consequences, in particular, is critical to many applications. Macroscopically, a surface is classified as hydrophilic or hydrophobic depending on the contact angle formed by a water droplet. Because hydrophobic surfaces tend to cause water slip whereas hydrophilic ones do not, the former surfaces can yield self-cleaning garments and ice-repellent materials whereas the latter cannot. The results presented herein suggest that this dichotomy might be purely coincidental. Our simulation results demonstrate that hydrophilic surfaces can show features typically associated with hydrophobicity, namely liquid water slip. Further analysis provides details on the molecular mechanism responsible for this surprising result.}}

We see in particular that both the apparent contact angle and the contact angle hysteresis can be dramatically affected by the presence of roughness. Owing to the development of refined methods for setting very well-controlled micro- or nanotextures on a solid, these effects are being exploited to induce novel wetting properties, such as spontaneous filmification, superhydrophobicity, superoleophobicity, and interfacial slip, that could not be achieved without roughness. }

journal = {Bioinspiration \& Biomimetics},
abstract = {The Lotus has been the symbol of purity for thousands of years; contaminations and pathogens are washed off the surfaces of Lotus and some other plants with rain or even dew. After the introduction of scanning electron microscopy, we were able to resolve the mechanism behind this phenomenon. It took some further decades before in-depth studies on self-cleaning with plants were conducted and the effect could be understood in detail. We identified extreme water-repellency (‘superhydrophobicity’), characterized by very high contact angles and low sliding angles, as the prerequisite for self-cleaning properties. We could show that the combination of two factors is necessary for obtaining a high degree of water-repellency: (1) low energy surfaces being hydrophobic and (2) surface structures that significantly increase hydrophobicity. It is suggested that this mechanism plays an important role in the protection of plants against pathogens. Our technological application of this effect has resulted in the development of successful, eco-friendly and sustainable industrial products. Another interesting property was found with superhydrophobic surfaces of certain aquatic and semi-aquatic plants and animals: here a layer of air under water is retained. We present a new approach of using this feature for creating structured, air-retaining surfaces for technical underwater applications. It is proposed that such surfaces can reduce significantly the drag of large ships. We conclude that basic biological research is of particular importance for true innovation. Our research on superhydrophobic self-cleaning biological surfaces and the development of similar engineered materials suggests that biomimicry is a matter of multi-stage processes rather than a simple copying of biological developments.}

It is not accidental that the earliest descriptions of the moving wetting line and its associated dynamic contact angle were in terms of displaced equilibria (chemists), friction (physicists) and viscous bending of the liquid–vapour interface (engineers and mathematicians). Each of these approaches has progressed since its inception, but, while each reflects a different facet of the underlying physical mechanism, and each offers at least a semi-empirical route to its description, none is complete. There is, as yet, no fully agreed treatment that is consistent with all three viewpoints and provides an effective basis for prediction—though at least one new hydrodynamic approach has emerged that goes some way in this direction. This paper seeks to offer a status report: to briefly review each of the current approaches, to illustrate their successes and limitations as revealed by experiment and simulation, and to suggest ways in which the different aspects of wetting dynamics might be investigated in the future.}

At steady state, this hydrodynamic effect is balanced by molecular diffusion; an analytical expression for the resulting concentration profile is derived. It is shown that the depletion layer thickness is determined by the normal stresses that develop in flow and can be much larger than the size of the polymer molecule. The transient development of this depletion layer is also studied, as well as the spatial development downstream from an entrance. Numerical and similarity solutions in these cases show that the developing concentration profile generally displays a maximum at an intermediate distance from the wall.}",

Genuinely predictive modeling of complex coating processes is not yet possible and coating practice remains largely empirical. Nonetheless, coating science is sufficiently advanced that physical insights and mathematical models greatly benefit design and practice. }

Four kinds of surfaces were used with characteristic wettability (given in terms of the contact angle): smooth glass, PVC, wax and rough glass. We studied in some detail the kinematics of the moving contact line during the spreading process. Particularly we are interested in the effects of the wettability of the wall by the liquid. The surface wettability has been observed to have a strong influence on the spreading of droplet in the later stages of the process. The results are presented in the form of charts describing the spreading diameter and apex height of droplets in terms of time.}

abstract = {The molecular-kinetic theory of dynamic wetting has been extended to take specific account of solid–liquid interactions. By equating the work of adhesion with the surface component of the specific activation free energy of wetting, equations have been derived which show the way in which solid–liquid interactions modify both the driving force and the resistance to wetting. For a liquid meniscus advancing across the surface of a solid, these two effects have opposing consequences. Thus, strong interactions increase both the driving force and the resistance, while weak interactions decrease the driving force and the resistance. Because of the form of the relationships, the two effects do not simply cancel out. As a result, the maximum rate at which a liquid can wet a solid may exhibit its own maximum at some intermediate level of interaction. Data taken from both experimental and molecular-dynamics simulations are shown to support these findings, which have significant implications for any process where wetting dynamics are important, such as coating.}

abstract = {The velocity-dependence of the dynamic contact angle is studied experimentally for a series of water-glycerol solutions having viscosities ranging from 1.5 to 672 mPa s. The results are interpreted through a theory of dynamic wetting as an interface disappearance-formation process, with the goal to analyse the dominant microscopic mechanism by which the interface formation occurs. As is shown, an assumption that this mechanism is diffusive in nature allows one to adequately describe the whole set of experimental data. Some estimates for the phenomenological parameters of the model are obtained.}

Fluid inhomogeneity is introduced by imposing an external potential that in one case simulates flat solid walls and in the other case causes density peaks in the middle of a thin liquid film. For comparison a homogeneous fluid is also simulated. In both types of inhomogeneous fluid, the shear stress and effective viscosity are smaller than in the homogeneous fluid. The density profiles and the diffusivities in the micropore were found to be independent of flow, even at the extremely high rates, 1010–1011 s−1 of the simulation. The Green–Kubo relation is found to be valid for the diffusivity under the flow studied. We propose a local average density model (LADM) of viscosity and diffusivity, in which the local transport coefficients are those of homogeneous fluid at a mean density obtained by averaging the local density over a molecular volume. LADM predicts qualitatively correct velocity profiles, effective viscosities, and shear stresses using only equilibrium density profiles and molecular diameters. An analogous local equilibrium version of Enskog’s theory of diffusivity agrees well with the simulated pore diffusivities. Recently Vanderlick and Davis generalized Enskog’s theory of diffusivity to strongly inhomogeneous fluids. Their theoretical pore diffusion coefficient is also in good agreement with simulation results.}",

The solid is assumed to be either flat, but chemically heterogeneous (this in turn modulating the interfacial tensions), or rough. For weak heterogeneities, we expect no hysteresis, but the contact line becomes wiggly. For stronger heterogeneities, we first discuss the behavior of the contact line in the presence of a single, localized defect, and show that there may exist two stable positions for the line, obtained by a simple graphic construction. Hysteresis shows up when the strength of the defect is above a certain threshold. Extending this to a dilute system of defects, we obtain formulas for the ‘‘advancing’’ and ‘‘receding’’ contact angles θa, θr, in terms of the distribution of defect strength and defect sharpness. These formulas might be tested by controlled contamination of a solid surface.}",

abstract={The influence of substrate roughness on wettability has been investigated at room and high temperatures using sixteen material combinations, mostly liquid metals and solid ceramics but also water, glycerol and solid nickel. The contact angles assumed by both wetting and non-wetting drops of all but two material combinations increased linearly with the relative steepness of the surface features, the effect being less for experiments conducted at high temperatures. In contrast, the contact angles of good wetting drops of glycerol and exceptionally good wetting drops of Easy-flo decreased when their silica and nickel substrates were roughened. Similarly, contact angles of both wetting and non-wetting drops were decreased by ultrasonic vibration. The experimental data can best be interpreted in terms of the metastable equilibrium configuration models in which an advancing liquid front has to overcome energy barriers associated with surface features. This occurs more readily if these barriers are small relative to the energy of the liquid which our data suggest can be equated with the enthalpy of the liquid. This interpretation enables the effects of substrate roughness at one temperature or with one liquid to be used to predict behaviour at other temperatures and with other liquids.},

A flat fluid interface moving steadily over a flat solid is modeled with the creeping flow approximation, which turns out to be self-consistent. Adherence is required except at the contact line itself. Though the velocity field appears to be realistic, stresses and viscous dissipation are found to increase without bound at the contact line. The way the hydrodynamic model breaks down suggests that in reality there may be steep gradients, rheological anomalies, and discontinuous processes around the contact line. Slip and the role of long-range forces are explored with the aid of the lubrication flow approximation.}
