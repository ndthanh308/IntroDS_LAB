\begin{abstract}
This paper introduces significant improvements to the GravAD pipeline, a Python-based system for gravitational wave detection. These advancements address the complexities of waveform templates and the heightened sensitivity of LIGO detectors. By integrating simulated signals and utilising optimisation techniques, GravAD exhibits increased performance, efficiency, and accuracy in processing GW data. Notable advancements include a reduction in required templates, leading to more efficient detection and freeing computational resources for further research. This pipeline also applies adaptive termination procedures for resource optimisation, enhancing GW detection speed and precision. The paper emphasises the importance of robust, efficient tools in gravitational wave data analysis, particularly given the finite nature of computational resources. Acknowledging system limitations such as dependency on ripple python library capabilities and suggests future enhancements in waveform generation and differentiation.
