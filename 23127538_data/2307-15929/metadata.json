  "abstract": "Terahertz (THz) communication is one of the most promising candidates to accommodate high-speed mobile data services. This paper proposes a secure hybrid automatic repeat request with incremental redundancy (HARQ-IR) aided THz communication scheme, where the transmission secrecy is ensured by confusing the eavesdropper with dummy messages. The connection and secrecy outage probabilities are then derived in closed-form. Besides, the tail behaviour of the connection outage probability in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is examined by carrying out the asymptotic analysis, and the upper bound of the secrecy outage probability is obtained in a simple form by capitalizing on large deviations. With these results, we take a step further to investigate the secrecy long term average throughput (LTAT). By noticing that HARQ-IR not only improves the reliability of the legitimate user, but also increases the probability of being eavesdropped, a robust rate adaption policy is finally proposed to maximize the LTAT while restricting the connection and secrecy outage probabilities within satisfactory requirements.",
