  "abstract": "In this paper, we propose a dynamic grouping negotiation model for climate mitigation based on real-world business and political negotiation protocols. Within the AI4GCC competition framework, we develop a three-stage process: group formation and updates, intra-group negotiation, and inter-group negotiation. Our model promotes efficient and effective cooperation between various stakeholders to achieve global climate change objectives. By implementing a group-forming method and group updating strategy, we address the complexities and imbalances in multi-region climate negotiations. Intra-group negotiations ensure that all members contribute to mitigation efforts, while inter-group negotiations use the proposal-evaluation framework to set mitigation and savings rates. We demonstrate our negotiation model within the RICE-N framework, illustrating a promising approach for facilitating international cooperation on climate change mitigation.",
