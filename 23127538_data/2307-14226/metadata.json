  "abstract": "Climate issues have become more and more important now. Although global governments have made some progress, we are still facing the truth that the prospect of international cooperation is not clear at present. Due to the limitations of the Integrated assessment models (IAMs) model, it is difficult to simulate the dynamic negotiation process. Therefore, using deep learning to build a new agents based model (ABM) might can provide new theoretical support for climate negotiations. Building on the RICE-N model, this work proposed an approach to climate negotiations based on existing trade groups. Simulation results show that the scheme has a good prospect.",
