\begin{abstract}
The accretion flow / jet correlation in neutron star (NS) X-ray binaries (XRBs) is far less understood when compared to black hole (BH) XRBs. Most notably, while in BH systems jet quenching occurs over spectral state transitions, the existence of an analogous pattern in NS XRBs is currently unclear. In this series, we will present the results of a dense multi-wavelength observational campaign on the NS XRB 4U 1820-30, including X-ray (\nicer, \nustar and \astrosat) and quasi-simultaneous radio (ATCA) observations spanning four months in 2022. \source shows a peculiar 170 day super-orbital accretion cycle, during which the system evolves between phases of high and low X-ray accretion modes. During our monitoring, the source was found in the soft ("banana") state. Both the X-ray hardness ratio and the fractional root mean square were found stable throughout the campaign. X-ray spectra were well modelled using a disc blackbody, a Comptonisation spectrum and a few discrete features, including absorption lines from O VIII ($\sim$0.6 keV) and Ne IX ($\sim$0.9 keV), along with an emission Fe K line at $\sim$6.6 keV. Our results show that the accretion disc properties are stable over the whole surveyed period, while a cyclic evolution of the Comptonisation component seems entirely responsible for the observed X-ray flux modulation. We interpret this trend as originated by energy flowing slowly from a larger, i.e., $\sim$15 km in radius, boundary layer in the high mode to a smaller, i.e., $\lesssim$10 km in radius, spreading layer in the low mode. Despite the minimal changes to the X-rays, we detect strong changes in the radio emission as the source moves from the high to low X-ray mode, i.e., being a factor of $\sim$5 brighter when the X-rays emission was faintest. These radio changes appear to not be strongly connected to the spectral hardness and might instead be due to the observed evolution in the innermost regions of the accretion flow.

\section{Introduction}
%Accretion is an ubiquitous phenomenon in the Universe and powers all sorts of high-energy emitting sources, from AGNs to Young Stellar Objects. Relativistic, collimated outflows of matter in the form of jets are also observed from these objects. Accretion and ejection appear as intimately different processes and yet, they seem to be deeply intertwined. However, the exact physical mechanisms underlying the coupling between matter inflows and outflows are still poorly understood. 
Neutron Star (NS) Low-Mass X-ray Binaries (LMXBs) are binary systems composed of a NS accreting matter from a companion low-mass, i.e., typically lower than 1 M$_\odot$, star. The material accreted onto the compact object is responsible for most of the electromagnetic emission of these sources from the optical to the X-rays. These systems have been historically grouped in two main classes, Z- and atoll sources, based on the particular tracks they draw in colour-colour diagrams \citep[][]{Hasinger1989}. Z-sources are the brightest among the two classes, being persistently active and always accreting around the Eddington limit. Atolls are typically fainter and thereby are considered to be accreting at lower rates. They can be persistent or transients, i.e. usually found in a dormant, faint X-ray regime called quiescence with only episodic outbursts where the X-ray luminosity becomes comparable to the level of the persistent NS LMXBs. The distinction between the classes is however blurred, with at least one system showing both Z or atoll behaviours \citep[see, e.g.,][]{Homan2010}. The accretion flow  consists typically of an optically thick accretion disc, an optically thin cloud of hot electrons usually dubbed corona, a boundary layer (BL) connecting the inner edge of the disc with the NS surface and a spreading layer (SL) on the surface itself \citep[e.g., ][]{Suleimanov2006}. 
%The presence of the NS surface stops the accretion
%flow forming a transition layer between the disc and the
%NS surface. This layer is also named spreading (SL) or
%boundary (BL) layer. In particular, the BL is the part
%of the accretion disc where the gas decelerates, while the
%SL is the gas layer at the NS surface, which can extend to
%high latitudes (Inogamov & Sunyaev 1999; Suleimanov
%& Poutanen 2006).
The observed X-ray spectral continuum from these sources can be broken down in several components, corresponding to these regions of the accretion flow: a multi-colour disc black body in the soft X-rays and a Comptonisation spectrum extending up to hundreds of keV \citep{Pintore2016, Ludlam2016, Gambino2019}. The contribution from a boundary layer between the disc and the NS surface or the surface itself can also be visible directly as an additional black body component or as source of the seed photons for the Comptonisation spectrum {\bf at a blackbody temperature $kT_{\rm bb}$ of about 1-2 keV} \citep[see, e.g.,][]{Mondal2020,Marino2022}. The X-ray spectral-timing properties of these objects evolve between two main states: one dominated by the corona emission, typically referred to as the hard state, and the other dominated by the accretion disc and/or the NS/boundary layer, i.e., the soft state \citep[for a review,][]{Done2007}. The hard/soft state dichotomy is traditionally explained in terms of different truncation stages of the accretion disc, i.e., being close to the compact object in the soft state while truncated far away from it in the hard state. However, the geometry of the accretion flow in X-ray binaries is still debated \citep[see, e.g.,][and references therein]{Zdziarski2020}. A particularly useful diagnostics tool to constrain the geometry of the inner accretion flow is the spectral modelling of the Fe K$\alpha$ line at 6.4-6.97 keV, since its profile is determined by, e.g., the location of the inner edge of the disc or its ionization \citep[e.g., ][]{DiSalvo2009, Cackett2010}, but data with high statistics and good spectral resolution are mandatory to break the degeneracy between different line profiles \citep[e.g., ][]{Garcia2015}.\\
In the radio--mid-IR region, the contribution of a compact jet, i.e., a collimated ionised outflow of relativistic particles ejected by the system, is instead dominant. The observed properties of the compact jet show a clear correlation with the accretion flow. This connection is well-established for Black Hole (BH) transients \citep[see, e.g.,][]{Corbel2000,Coriat2011}, where as their X-ray spectral-timing properties display dazzling variations between hard and soft states, perfectly analogous to the states observed in NS LMXBs, the jet evolves from being radio loud to a quenched state, respectively \citep{Fender2004}. However, this standard pattern is less clear for NS systems. Jet suppression at the hard-to-soft transition is only sometimes observed in NS LMXBs \citep[][]{Gusinskaia2017}, but it seems not to be the norm \citep[][]{Migliari2004}. Interestingly, jet quenching in some accreting NSs has been sometimes observed without a state transition but corresponding to an increase in flux \citep{Russell2021, Panurach2023}, suggesting a more complex accretion/ejection coupling with respect to BH XRBs. When observed, jets in NS LMXBs are generally $\sim$20 times radio-fainter than BH LMXBs \citep[e.g., ][]{Gallo2018, VandenEijnden2021}, although several systems, often harbouring X-ray millisecond pulsars \citep[e.g.,][]{Russell2018,Gusinskaia2020,Cotizelati2021}, have been observed at radio luminosity comparable to BH systems. Different jet geometries and/or weaker couplings with the accretion flow in accreting NSs with respect to BHs have been also proposed \citep[][]{Marino2020}. The emerging observational picture is yet not well understood and, in particular, the role (if any) played by the NS magnetic field, its emitting surface, its spin, or the presence of a boundary layer is unclear. Multi-wavelength surveys of these systems that probe the behaviour of the jets and the accretion flow over a variety of mass accretion rates/X-ray states are crucial to self-consistently explore jet launching in NSs. \\

\subsection{4U 1820-303} \label{ss:source}
{\bf A particularly intriguing target to perform this kind of studies is the NS LMXB 4U 1820-30. This source is composed by a NS accreting matter from a White Dwarf (WD) companion in a tight orbit. Indeed, with its orbital period of only 11.4 minutes \citep[][]{Stella1987}, i.e., the shortest orbital period known for any XRB, \source is identified as an Ultra-Compact XRB \citep[UCXB, for a recent review][]{ArmasPadilla2023}.} Located at a distance of about 7.6 kpc \citep{Kuulkers2003}, the system resides within the globular cluster NGC 6624. The source is classified as an atoll and it is persistently accreting at a relatively high luminosity, displaying mostly soft X-ray spectral states (the so-called "banana" state for atolls), with occasional transitions to the hard state ("island" state) \citep{Tarana2007}. Its behaviour is indeed similar to what observed in the so-called "bright atolls" group \citep[e.g.,][]{Dai2010,Egron2013,Iaria2020}. Perhaps the most peculiar aspect of the source is the regular, $\sim$ 170 d, super-orbital accretion cycle exhibited by the source. During a cycle, \source\ oscillates between a low mode, at $L_{\rm low}\sim 8\times 10^{36}$ \ergs and a high mode, at $L_{\rm high}\sim 6\times 10^{37}$ \ergs (\textbf{in the range 0.5-10 keV and assuming a distance D= 7.6 ${\rm kpc})$}. These modes are characterized by different spectral properties, most likely connected to changes in the accretion flow. In the low mode, the system can be found in soft and sometimes in the hard X-ray spectral states, during which it exhibits frequent type-I X-ray bursts. On the other hand, in the high mode, the system is only soft and bursts are absent \citep[see, e.g., ][]{Titarchuk2013}. The luminosity modulation is intrinsic, i.e., not due to absorption from occulting plasma \citep[][]{Zdziarski2007a}, and it likely originates from tidal forces exerted on the binary system by a distant third object \citep[][]{Chou2001}. The presence of the Fe K line in the X-ray spectrum is debated, with detections reported only by a number of X-ray spectral studies \citep[][]{Cackett2008,Titarchuk2013} and not by others \citep[e.g., ][]{Costantini2012, Mondal2016}. %The presence of the line has been also found to be model-dependent \citep[][]{Mondal2016}. It is noteworthy that these features have proved to be elusive in many other ultra-compact XRBs \citep[][]{Koliopanos2021}, probably due to the material transferred from the highly evolved companion star being intrinsically iron poor. 
Moreover, while \source\ was initially identified as a non-quenching jet NS \citep[][]{Migliari2004}, it has been recently suggested that jet quenching does occur \citep[][]{Russell2021}. Indeed, the change in spectral properties of the jet seem to occur only when, in the transition from low to high mode, the X-ray flux exceeds a certain threshold \citep[see, Fig. 2,][]{Russell2021}. Such a result would suggest a critical connection between jet and mass-accretion rate rather than spectral hardness, in a way that was never observed for BH systems and that is instead sometimes observed in accreting NSs, both in High-Mass \citep{VanDenEijnden2018_jet} and Low-Mass \citep{Panurach2023} XRBs. However, those results were obtained from observations taken sporadically over the past $\sim$17 years. To properly understand the accretion-ejection coupling in this system - and potentially in similar objects - it is fundamental to measure the accretion flow/jet properties over a single accretion cycle. \\
In this series of papers, we present the results of a comprehensive radio--X-rays observational campaign performed throughout 2022, aimed at following \source\ in the X-rays and radio during a whole super-orbital cycle. In this manuscript, we present the results of a broadband X-ray spectral analysis and timing analysis using \nicer\ , \nustar and \astrosat\ data from the 2022 April-September cycle. We also used data from the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) taken close to our broadband X-ray spectra to show the jet evolution during this cycle. A companion paper (Paper II, Russell et al., in preparation) will present the results of the complete radio monitoring and how they compare with the X-rays data analysis reported here.

%. As shown in Figure , the jet seems to be insensitive to the hard-to-soft transition (occurring within the low mode), but is instead critically affected by the mode, and therefore by the mass accretion rate. 


%Ultra-compact XRBs have usually weak or absent Fe Kα lines (see, e.g. Koliopanos et al., 2021), probably due to the material transferred from the highly evolved compan- ion star being intrinsically iron poor. In the case of 4U 1820−30, the Fe K line has been reported only by a number of studies (e.g. Cackett et al., 2008, Titarchuk et al., 2013), while other observa- tions did not reveal such features, also with XMM– Newton (Costantini et al., 2012). The presence of the line has been also found to be model-dependent (Mondal et al., 2016). Interestingly, the line was not detected when the 4U 1820−30 was in high mode which may suggest a correlation between the mode and the presence of emission lines, as for compact jets. 

%The lack of detection in Costan- tini et al., 2012, was possibly due to the low expo- sure (just 2 ks) because the EPIC-pn was operated in full-frame mode with central pixels masked. Longer exposures will enable detection of the iron line, which is intrinsically weak. 

 
%Absorption in 4U 1820−30 has been already addressed by Cack- ett et al., 2008b with Chandra and Costantini et al., 2012 with XMM/RGS. Despite many lines have been interpreted as due to absorption from the interstel- lar medium, the origin of other features, such as the O VIII Lyα, remains yet to be confirmed

\section{Observations \& Data reduction}
A dense X-ray campaign has been performed during the spring-summer of 2022, with 17 \nicer\, 3 \nustar\ and 1 \astrosat\ observations. A summary of these observations is reported in Table \ref{tab:obs}. All data were reprocessed using the \textsc{HEAsoft} package v. 6.30. The latest available \textsc{CALDB} version was used for all the instruments. More details on the data reduction for each observatory are given in the following subsections.

\subsection{\nicer}
A two-weeks cadence monitoring campaign was performed by \nicer (see Table \ref{tab:obs}). Data were reduced using \texttt{nicerl2} task (\texttt{NICERDAS 2019-05-21 v006}). We set recommended calibration processes, standard screening and we added the \texttt{niprefilter2$\_$coltypes=base,3c50} parameter so that the \texttt{3C50} model can be used to derive background spectra later. We extracted the cleaned event files, checking that all detectors were active during observations and excluding data from the "noisy" detectors (labelled 14 and 34), in order to reduce the detector noise. We accumulated light curves from all the observations using the {\tt xselect} tool, with the aim to check for type-I X-ray bursts, finding only one, e.g., in observation 5604010304. In the following data analysis, the burst was excluded. Then we selected the GTI using \texttt{NIMAKETIME} and applied them to the data via \texttt{NIEXTRACT-EVENTS}, selecting events with PI channel between 25 and 1200 (0.25–12.0~keV). We used the {\tt nibackgen3C50} tool to extract both the spectra of the source and the background from the cleaned event files, selecting the 2020 gain calibration. \\ 
{\bf During the writing of this manuscript, the updated \textsc{HEAsoft} version 6.31 was released, along with substantial changes to the \nicer mission data analysis pipeline. To check for consistency, we reanalysed three observations of the 2022 \nicer campaign using a different background model, i.e. the SCORPEON model. The spectra obtained with the different \textsc{HEAsoft} versions are practically identical and the best-fit parameters obtained are not significantly affected by the change of version and/or background model. We therefore did not reanalyse the whole data set and kept working on the spectra obtained with the previous \textsc{HEAsoft} version. }
%{\bf A new version of \textsc{HeaSOFT} (v.6.31) was released during the writing of this manuscript, along with major updates to the \nicer pipelines. In order to check for consistency with our data, we have extracted three spectra using the updated \textsc{HeaSOFT} version and used SCORPEON model for the background. The old and new spectra were virtually identical and the spectral parameters needed to describe them were compatible. We therefore decided not to reanalyse the whole sample of \nicer data.}

%\com{NICER responses extraction} \\ \com{comparison with new NICER pipelines}.
%In order to fix the distortions due to the \nicer calibration uncertainties, we re-normalised the spectra by using the residuals of a power-law fit to the Crab Nebula \citep{Ludlam2018}. 
%Finally, we exploited the public files \texttt{nixtiaveonaxis20170601v002.arf} and \texttt{nixtiref20170601v001.rmf} as Ancillary Response File and Redistribution Matrix File, respectively, retrievable from the {\it NICER} website\footnote{See \url{https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer/proposals/nicer_tools.html}.}. %
\subsection{\nustar}
\nustar observed the system three times during this campaign, for a total exposure of about 58.6~ks. We reduced the data using standard tools within the \texttt{Nustardas} package. A 100" radius circular region centered at the coordinates of the source was selected as source region. In order to take into account any background non-uniformity on the detector, we extracted the background spectra using four circles of $\sim$50" radii placed on different areas which were well far away from the source region. Finally, we used \texttt{Nuproducts} to extract spectra and light curves. We systematically checked for the presence of type-I X-ray bursts within the \nustar observations, but we did not find any. %We used data from both the hard X-ray imaging telescopes on board {\it NuSTAR}, i.e., the focal plane mirrors (FPM) A and B.  


%\swift XRT performed 34 visits of \source in 2022, i.e. from April 1 to October 26 (Table \com{XX}). All observations were performed in Window Timing (WT) mode. We downloaded the data from the \textsc{HEASARC} public archive\footnote{\url{https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/archive.html}} (source ID: 00014980). Data processing was performed with the \textsc{HEAsoft} task \texttt{xrtpipeline}. We carefully checked the light curve of each observation searching for bursts, and exclude them from the following analysis whenever they occurred. In order to check the pile-up impact, we verified that the \source\ average count-rate in all visits was below 100 cts/s. Whenever the source was not affected by pile-up, we used circles of 20 pixels (corresponding to $\sim$47\arcsecond) for the source and background regions. For the observations with a count-rate beyond the fiduciary 100 cts/s threshold, we used annuli with the inner radius selected depending on the registered count-rate, in accordance with the {\it Swift}/XRT guidelines\footnote{ \url{https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/lheasoft/ftools/headas/xrtgrblc.html}}. The outer radius was instead consistently chosen as $\sim$47''. We used these regions to extract spectra and light curves.

\citep[\textsc{SXT}, ][]{Singh2016} and the Large Area X-rays Proportional Counter \citep[\textsc{LAXPC}][]{Yadav2016, Antia2017, Antia2021} on-board \astrosat \citep{Agrawal2006, Singh2014}. 
%\subsubsection{\textsc{LAXPC}}
\textsc{LAXPC}, one of the primary instruments on-board and consists of three co-aligned identical proportional counter detectors, viz. \textsc{LAXPC10}, \textsc{LAXPC20} and \textsc{LAXPC30}.~Each of these work in the energy range of 3$-$80~\rm{keV} \citep[for details see,][]{Yadav2016, Antia2017, Antia2021}.~Due to the gain instability caused by the gas leakage, \textsc{LAXPC10} data were not used while \textsc{LAXPC30} was switched off during these observations\footnote{LAXPC30 is switched off since 8 March 2018, refer to \url{http://astrosat-ssc.iucaa.in/}}.~Therefore, we have used data from \textsc{LAXPC20} for our work. These data were collected in the Event mode (EA) which contains the information about the time, channel number and anodeID of each event.~\textsc{LaxpcSoft} v3.3\footnote{\url{http://www.tifr.res.in/~astrosat\_laxpc/LaxpcSoft.html}} software package was used to extract spectra.
Background files are generated using the blank sky observations \citep[see][for details]{Antia2017}.

%\subsubsection{\textsc{SXT}}

The \textsc{SXT} aboard \astrosat is a focusing instrument sensitive mainly in the 0.3–7~\rm{keV} energy band \citep{Singh2014,Singh2017} and its camera
assembly uses an e2v CCD, identical to that on
\emph{XMM-Newton}-\textsc{MOS} and \emph{Swift}-\textsc{XRT}. The \textsc{SXT} observations of \source were carried out in the photon counting mode. We have used Level-2 data provided by the \textsc{SXT} payload operation center (POC) in Mumbai, India, reduced using the most recent pipeline and calibration database (version 1.4b).~Events from each orbit were merged using \textsc{SXT} Event Merger Tool (Julia Code\footnote{\url{http://www.tifr.res.in/~astrosat\_sxt/dataanalysis.html}}).~These merged events were used to extract image, spectra using the ftool task \textsc{xselect}. The pileup effect is very common for the CCD-based detectors, however, due to large PSF of \textsc{SXT}, 
if a source has a count rate less than 40~$cs^{-1}$, it is safe to assume no pile-up for the PC mode\footnote{\url{https://web.iucaa.in/~astrosat/AstroSat_handbook.pdf}}.~We observed a count rate greater than 80~$\rm{c~s^{-1}}$ in the \textsc{SXT} data of \source, indicating the presence of pile-up issues.~To minimise the effect of the pile-up, source spectrum is extracted from an annulus between 5~$\arcmin$ and 15~$\arcmin$ from the centre of the image, following the method described in \citep{Chakraborty2020}.
We have used the response~(sxt\_pc\_mat\_g0to12.rmf) and background~(SkyBkg\_comb\_EL3p5\_Cl\_Rd16p0\_v01.pha) files provided by the \textsc{SXT} team.~The appropriate ARF file suitable for the specific source region is generated using the command line auxiliary tool \textsc{sxtARFModule}.




%We analysed data from \textsc{SXT}
%\citep{Singh2016} and LAXPC \citep{Yadav2016} only. SXT was used in .... mode. We processed level 1 data with ... pipeline and produced level 2 cleaned event files. After merging level 2 files from each orbit, we used the merged event file to extract science products, such as spectra and light curves, by means of the FTOOLS task \textsc{xselect}. A circular (?) region of radius ... and centered on the PSF of the source was employed. A blank sky SXT spectrum (\texttt{SkyBkg\_comb\_EL3p5\_Cl\_Rd16p0\_v01.pha}) was used as background spectrum, while we used the spectral redistribution matrix file (\texttt{sxt\_pc\_mat\_g0to12}) provided by the SXT team. Finally, we generated the correct off-axis auxiliary response files (ARF) using \texttt{sxtARFModule} tool from the on-axis ARF (........) provided by the SXT instrument team. Among the three proportional counters LAXPC consists of, we used only LAXPC20 detector for our analysis since LAXPC10 ? and LAXPC30 has been switched off since 2018\footnote{\url{http://astrosat-ssc.iucaa.in/}}. We used the data collected in .... mode and processed using \textsc{LaxpcSoft2} version XXX in order to extract the scientific products. Also for the LAXPC background, we used a %file obtained from the blank sky observations ?.

\section{Spectral analysis}\label{sec:spectral}
The light curve of \source\ as observed by the Monitor of All Sky X-ray Image (MAXI) during 2022 is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:lcurve}, in yellow. The super-orbital modulation of the source, with its succession of high and low modes, is apparent from the plot. Superimposed to the MAXI curve, the dates of the \nicer\ , \nustar\ and \astrosat visits are highlighted. In order to set the evolution of the system during this cycle in the framework of its observational history, we created a Hardness Intensity Diagram (HID) using \maxi and \swift\ /BAT data. In particular we collected all the available \maxi\ count-rates (in the 2--4 keV and 2--20 keV energy ranges) since October 2009 and the corresponding, i.e. taken the same day, BAT count-rates (15--50 keV) from the respective websites\footnote{\maxi : \url{ http://maxi.riken.jp/top/index.html}, BAT: \url{https://swift.gsfc.nasa.gov/results/transients/}}. We then plotted \maxi total count-rates versus the ratio between BAT and \maxi count-rates in the 2--4 keV band to build the HID (see Fig. \ref{fig:HID}). In the Figure, we highlighted the position of the source in the HID in the days of the \nicer and/or \nustar observations, showing that the source lingered in the soft ("banana") state during the whole surveyed cycle. We notice, however, how during the surveyed cycle the source moved back and forth along the vertical track, crossing several times the flux threshold ("jet line") which was previously proposed to be connected to a drastic change in the observed jet properties \citep{Russell2021}. \\
In order to perform the spectral analysis, we grouped all \nicer\ and \nustar\ spectra through optimal binning \citep{Kaastra2016}, i.e. in order to have a grouping consistent with the spectral resolution of the instrument (and avoid oversampling) in a given energy range, but at the same time keeping at least 20 counts per bin to ensure the use of the $\chi^2$ statistics. The \textsc{SXT} and \textsc{LAXPC} spectra were grouped to have at least 25 counts/bin.~The \textsc{LAXPC} spectra showed a large calibration uncertainty, with background dominating above 20~keV.~Similar issues have also been observed in other observations \citep[see e.g.,][]{Beri2020, Sharma2023}. Therefore, we have used data only up to 20 keV for our spectral analysis. \\
We used \textsc{Xspec} v.12.12.1 for all the performed spectral fits. In all cases, we used the \textsc{tbabs} model to take into account interstellar absorption, including the photoelectric cross-sections and the element abundances to the values provided by \cite{Verner1996} and \cite{Wilms2000}, respectively. When data from different instruments were used simultaneously, a \textsc{constant} component was also included to account for inter-calibration uncertainties between different instruments. We consistently checked that discrepancies between the values for the constant term found for different instruments were not larger than 20\% . {\bf When fitting together \nicer and \nustar , a small offset between the slopes of those spectra could be appreciated, as often observed using data from different instruments \citep[see, e.g.,][]{Ludlam2020}. To take into account such an instrumental issue, we left the $\Gamma$ parameter in the \textsc{Xspec} Comptonisation component untied between \nicer and \nustar , in order to allow some variability in between the two data sets. However, we checked systematically that the difference in $\Gamma$ was never above 10\%.} 
%For the spectral analysis of the \nustar\ data we did not sum the FPMA and FPMB spectra, but rather fitted them simultaneously by leaving a floating cross-normalization constant\footnote{In accordance with the guidelines from the \nustar team, see FAQ page, issue 19: \url{https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nustar/nustar_faq.html}}.
%({\it Middle}) \nicer light curve during the 2022 campaign. For each point, we report the flux in the 0.5-10 keV range as estimated from spectral fitting (see sec. \ref{sec:spectral} for details). ({\it Bottom}) \nicer Hardness ratio (2-10 keV/0.5-2 keV).

Among the seventeen \nicer\ observations used, several have been performed in a span of a few days within each other. In order to maximize the statistics in each spectrum, we checked whether any difference in flux and/or hardness could be appreciated between close-in-time observations. If the spectra were compatible, we summed them by means of the FTOOL \textsc{addspec}. Otherwise, we analysed them separately. This strategy leaves us with eleven final \nicer\ observations. The three \nustar\ observations caught the source during two high modes and a low mode. In all three cases, at least one \nicer\ observation was performed within $\sim$days from the \nustar\ visit, giving us the opportunity to investigate the broadband X-ray spectral behaviour of the source at the extremes of its super-orbital oscillation. In particular we paired Ni02 with Nu01, Ni06 with Nu02, Ni10 with Nu03. In the following the broadband spectra will be simply referred to as A, B and C respectively. 

%The geometrical assumption is the same as Titarchuk+13

\subsection{Broadband spectra: the continuum}
An initial fit of spectra A, B and C with a simple absorbed \texttt{powerlaw} model resulted in poor fits in all cases. We replaced the power-law with a more physically motivated thermal Comptonisation model, using the convolution model \texttt{thcomp} \citep{Zdziarski2020_thcomp} and a blackbody model \texttt{bbodyrad} as seed photons spectrum. The involved parameters are the power-law photon index $\Gamma$, the electron temperature of the Comptonising medium $kT_e$, the fraction of the seed source covered by the scattering cloud $f_{\rm cov}$, the blackbody temperature $kT_{\rm bb}$ and its normalisation $K_{\rm bb}$, the latter being connected to the actual blackbody radius of the source through the formula: $K_{\rm bb}=\left(R_{\rm bb}/D_{\rm 10 \ kpc}\right)^2$, with $D_{\rm 10 \ kpc}$ the distance of the source in units of 10~kpc. Using a model with a high energy roll-over such as \texttt{thcomp} improved the fit, but apparent residuals at low energies suggested the presence of an additional spectral component to be included. We therefore added a \texttt{diskbb} component, characterised by a disc blackbody temperature $kT_{\rm disc}$ and a normalisation $K_{\rm disc}$ which, similarly to the \texttt{bbodyrad} normalisation, can be translated into the size of the black body emitting region by the formula $K_{\rm disc}=\left(R_{\rm disc}/D_{\rm 10 \ kpc}\right)^2 \cos{i}$ with $i$ the inclination of the system. In the disc case, the size of the emitting region can be considered as the inner radius of the disc. Using \texttt{diskbb}, the fit to the continuum becomes acceptable  and the residuals are significantly flattened. The model chosen is therefore:

\begin{equation}
    {\rm Model \ 0}: \texttt{tbabs}\times(\texttt{thcomp}\times\texttt{bbodyrad}+\texttt{diskbb})
\end{equation}

We tried to swap \texttt{diskbb} and \texttt{bbodyrad}, testing a scenario where the disc photons serve as Comptonisation seed photons but we found that the resulting estimates for $R_{\rm disc}$ are relatively small for all spectra, in particular for spectrum C with an unphysical upper limit of 8 km. We also tried to apply a second \texttt{thcomp} component to \texttt{diskbb}, driven by the expectation that the corona should also Compton scatter at least a fraction of the disc photons, but without any statistical improvement. \\ 
We used Model 0 also to describe the \astrosat observation (labelled As01), obtaining a satisfactory fit and overall accordance between the best-fit parameters found and A, B and C spectra.

Different line styles were adopted to distinguish between the different components: dot for \textsc{bbodyrad}, dash for \textsc{relxillCp} and, dash-dot-dot-dot for \textsc{relxillCp} with the parameter $f_{\rm refl}$ set negative in order to highlight the pure reflection component, and dash-dot for the instrumental \textsc{gaussian} at 1.7~keV, due to Si fluorescence.

\subsection{Broadband spectra: discrete spectral features}
Even with a satisfying description of the continuum, some localised residuals could still be spotted at about 6.5-7 keV, clear sign of an unmodelled feature. This is particularly evident in the top panel of Fig. \ref{fig:residuals}, where we show Spectrum B as a representative example. The presence of residuals in this region has been also reported by other authors, and tackled with a combination of absorption edges \citep[in particular in][]{Mondal2016} or as a reflection Fe line \citep[e.g.,][]{Titarchuk2013}. Following the former authors' prescription, we included two absorption edges with the \texttt{edge} model in \texttt{Xspec}. We limited the energies of the edges to the ranges 6.8-7.0 keV and 7.5-7.8 keV respectively, as done for the \nustar spectra in \cite{Mondal2016}. A slight improvement in the fit can be appreciated, but the structure in the residuals is still present (Middle panel, Fig. \ref{fig:residuals}).
We therefore removed the edges and added instead a \texttt{diskline} component to the three spectra. Not only the inclusion of the feature results in a better improvement of the fit, but also in flat residuals. In the following, we will use this component in our spectral modelling. Due to the relative weakness of the spectral feature, i.e., normalisation $K_{\rm line}$ ranging from 2$\times$10$^{-3}$ for spectra A and B to 7$\times10^{-3}$ for spectrum C, not all line parameters could be well constrained. We then left the line energy $E_{\rm line}$, the inner radius of the disc $R_{\rm in}$ and $K_{\rm line}$ as the only free parameters, fixing the inclination to 45$^\circ$ \citep[in accordance with the inclination range individuated by][]{Anderson1997}, the emissivity index $\epsilon$ to -2 and the outer radius of the disc $R_{\rm out}$ to 1000 R$_{\rm G}$. The feature is found at an energy $E_{\rm line}$ of $\sim$6.6 keV in all three spectra. Only upper limits could be posed to $R_{\rm in}$, in all cases suggesting a disc that extends relatively close to the NS. The feature is found highly significant (6$\sigma$ confidence) in spectra A and B, while only marginally significant (4.5$\sigma$ confidence) in spectrum C. Such a trend may indicate an evolution in the reflection component, as discussed in Section \ref{ss:iron-line}. \\ 
In order to perform a more physically motivated description of the reflection component, we tried to use the \texttt{relxill} model \citep{Dauser2013}. {\bf However, as the spectrum illuminating the disc in this case is not a power-law like spectrum, we chose not to use flavors typically used for BH systems in hard state, such as e.g. \texttt{relxillCp}. Instead}, we adopted \texttt{relxillNS} \citep{Garcia2022}, a novel flavour which takes into account reflection arising when the disc is irradiated by a blackbody spectrum i.e., mimicking the case of a NS thermal emission illuminating the disc. We tried both replacing the Comptonisation component with \texttt{relxillNS} altogether and using it with a negative reflection fraction in order to describe only reflection. In both cases, the model is unable to describe adequately the data, mostly because the assumption of a blackbody hitting the disc and producing reflection does not fit well our case, i.e., where reflection arises from a Comptonisation spectrum rather than thermal emission from the NS. \\
Clear absorption residuals were also present in the soft X-ray band, below 1 keV. We improved the fit by multiplying the whole model by two \texttt{gabs} components, i.e., to account for absorption lines of gaussian profiles. The energies of these features were found to be at $E_{\rm line, 1}\sim$0.6 keV and  $E_{\rm line, 2}\sim$0.9 keV and can be associated to the O VIII and the Ne IX complex, respectively \citep[which are known to be present in the spectra of the source, e.g., ][]{Costantini2012}. Due to the inability of the fit to constrain all parameters of the components, we fixed the width of the lines $\sigma_{\rm line,1}$ and $\sigma_{\rm line,2}$ to 0.01 keV and instead left the parameter controlling the depth of the line, $\tau_{\rm line,1}$ and $\tau_{\rm line,2}$, free to vary. {\bf Among these features, the O line is detected at a solid significance of 5$\sigma$ in spectrum A, 14$\sigma$ in spectrum B and 10$\sigma$ in spectrum C. The Ne line is instead only marginally significant, i.e. detected at 3$\sigma$ in spectra A and C and at $\sim$4$\sigma$ in spectrum B.}\\
With these additions, our final model, herafter Model 1, is the following:

\begin{equation}
    \texttt{tbabs}\times\texttt{gabs}\times\texttt{gabs}\times(\texttt{thcomp}\times\texttt{bbodyrad}+\texttt{diskbb}+\texttt{diskline})
\end{equation}

{\bf Furthermore, some absorption features were found in the \nicer spectra at energies of $\sim$1.8 keV, $\sim$2.2 keV as well as an emission feature at $\sim$1.7 keV. The nature of such lines is most likely instrumental, e.g. due to silicon and gold in the detector or the filters. We therefore introduced some additional gaussian features to take them into account.} \\
For the fit to the \astrosat As01 spectrum, we included the \texttt{diskline} component, but left out instead the two absorption gaussian component. Indeed, \astrosat known calibration issues makes evaluate the presence of such features more challenging. The broadband spectra fitted with Model 1 and respective residuals are shown in Figure \ref{fig:ABC_spectra} and \ref{fig:astrosat}, while we refer to Table \ref{tab:fit_broadband} for the best-fit parameters obtained.

\subsection{Results on the \nicer monitoring}\label{ss:nicer}
In order to reconstruct a more detailed physical evolution of the system during this cycle, we then analysed individually each of the final 11 \nicer spectra (see above for the criteria followed in pairing some of the original 17 spectra to increase the statistics). We consistently used a modified version of Model 1. Indeed, without the hard X-rays coverage provided by \nustar and/or \astrosat , the degeneracies between $kT_e$, $\Gamma$ and the blackbody parameters made the parameters of the fits with \texttt{thcomp}$\times$\texttt{bbodyrad} completely unconstrained. We therefore decided to replace this component with the simpler \texttt{nthcomp}, the main difference being the lack of knowledge on the normalisation of the seed photons spectrum. For the same reason, we had to fix the seed photons temperature in \texttt{nthcomp} $kT_{\rm seed}$ to 1.0 keV, compatible with the values obtained for the broadband fits. In addition, for the modelling of the discrete features, we had to fix some parameters as the fit was unable to find meaningful constraints for them. In particular, we fixed $R_{\rm in}$ in \texttt{diskline} to 20 R$_{\rm G}$ and the energies of the absorption features $E_{\rm line,1}$ and $E_{\rm line, 2}$ to 0.68 keV and 0.87 keV respectively. The best-fit parameters obtained are shown in Tab. \ref{tab:fit_nicer_all}. In Fig. \ref{fig:nicer-all} we display how the main best-fit parameters, the 0.5-10 keV flux and the hardness ratio evolve over time during this cycle. From the Table and the plot it is apparent how some parameters, like $K_{\rm compt}$ and $K_{\rm diskline}$, seem to follow the super-orbital modulation traced by the flux, while others, in particular the disc temperatures $kT_{\rm disc}$ and radius $R_{\rm disc}$, appear stable.

%We used Model 1 to analyse all 11 Nicer spectra. Thcomp was not working because of the limited energy band, so we replaced it with nthcomp. We fixed some parameters which were left unconstrained by the fit with only nicer. The best-fit parameters obtained are shown in Tab. \ref{tab:fit_nicer_all}.

\section{Timing analysis}\label{sec:timing}
In order to investigate the timing properties of the source during the mid-2022 accretion cycle, we extracted Leahy-normalised power density spectra (PDS) in the 0.5-10 keV energy range, breaking down the observations in 26-s long segments and using a bin-time of 0.2 ms. We then averaged the PDS created from each segment to produce one averaged PDS per observation with a Nyquist frequency of $\approx$ 2.5~kHz. Instead of subtracting the Poisson noise contribution, we rather fitted it with a constant component. A representative sample of the obtained PDS is shown in Figure \ref{fig:PDS}. The shape of the PDS shows little-to-no evolution through the 17 considered snapshots. We found structures at about 0.5 Hz hinting at Quasi-Periodic Oscillations (QPOs) in four observations, i.e., Ni02, Ni03, Ni04, Ni05. However, only for the first two observations, we were able to properly fit the feature, finding a core frequency $\nu_{\rm QPO}$ of $\sim$0.58 Hz and $\sim$0.42 Hz, respectively, and width $\Delta\nu_{\rm QPO}$ of $\sim$0.15 and $\sim$0.07 Hz, respectively. These features are marginally significant in both cases, i.e., at confidence levels of 3 and 2.6 $\sigma$ respectively. The similar features in Ni03 and Ni04 are instead too weak to be properly fitted. From each PDS, we estimated the fractional root mean square (RMS), listed in Table \ref{tab:rms}. The fractional X-ray emission variability is remarkably steady, i.e., averaging around 2-3.5\%, in line with the system being in the banana state \citep{MunozDarias2014}. These results, and their physical implications, will be discussed in Section \ref{sec:disc}.

\section{Radio observations}
\subsection{ATCA data reduction}
\source\ was observed by the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) 13 times throughout 2022. In the present work, we will only use the observations which were performed close to the \nustar observations, while an analysis of the complete sample will be presented in a forthcoming paper (Russell et al., in preparation). The dates of the three observations presented here are: 2022 April 15, May 28 and July 10. During these observations, ATCA was in its more extended 6D, 1.5B, and 6B configurations\footnote{\url{https://www.narrabri.atnf.csiro.au/operations/array_configurations/configurations.html}}, respectively. In all cases, the fixed location antenna 6 (located 6\,km from the array core) was used during the analysis, providing angular resolutions of $\sim$a few arcseconds for all observations. Observations were recorded simultaneously at central frequencies of 5.5 and 9\,GHz, with a bandwidth of 2\,GHz at each central frequency comprised of 2048 1-MHz channels. We used PKS B1934$-$638 for bandpass and flux density calibration, and B1817$-$254 for phase calibration. Data were flagged, calibrated, and imaged following standard procedures\footnote{\url{https://casaguides.nrao.edu/index.php/ATCA_Tutorials}} in the Common Astronomy Software Application (\textsc{casa} version 5.1.2; \citealt{Casa2022}). Imaging used a Briggs weighting scheme with a robust parameter of 0, balancing sensitivity and resolution, providing angular resolutions of $\sim$a few arcseconds. 

\subsection{Results}
The flux density, $S_{\nu}$, of the point source was measured by fitting an elliptical Gaussian with full width at half maximum (FWHM) set by the synthesised beam shape. Errors on the absolute flux density scale include conservative systematic uncertainties of 4\% for the 5.5/9\,GHz ATCA data\footnote{\url{https://www.atnf.csiro.au/observers/memos/d96783~1.pdf}} \citep[e.g.,][]{2010MNRAS.402.2403M}, which were added in quadrature with the root mean square (RMS) of the image noise. The radio luminosity, $L_{\rm R}$, was calculated as $L_{\rm R} = 4 \pi S_{\nu} \nu D^{2}$, where $\nu$ is the observing frequency and $D$ is the distance to the source. \\
According to our measurements, a significant radio enhancement can be appreciated during the low X-ray mode (compared to the high-mode). In particular, the radio flux density increases from 70-110 $\mu$Jy (in epochs A and B) to $\sim$500 $\mu$Jy in epoch C. This is the brightest radio flux density recorded for \source at these frequencies \citep{DiazTrigo2017,Russell2021}. The radio spectral shape was found flat during epoch C ($\alpha\sim$-0.2), steep for epoch B ($\alpha\sim$-0.9), and unconstrained for epoch A, being consistent with flat, inverted or steep. This dramatic evolution of the jet properties between high and low modes suggests strong changes in the structure of the jet between modes, as already reported by \cite{Russell2021}. We will compare this intriguing trend with the accretion flow evolution tracked by the X-rays data analysis in Section \ref{ss:jet}.

%Then we extracted power density spectra (PDS) in the 0.5 -- 15.0 keV energy range in segments $\approx$15\,s long. We then averaged the Leahy-normalised PDS created from each segment to produce one averaged PDS per observation with a Nyquist frequency of $\approx$1000\,Hz. We did not correct for the contribution of the Poisson noise, but fitted it with a flat power law  when modeling the PDS. 
%In order to corroborate the spectral state identification, we extracted the Leahy-normalised \nicer Fourier Power Density Spectrum (PDS) for Epoch 4 in the 0.5--10 keV energy range. We used a bin-time of 5 ms. We did not subtract the Poisson noise contribution, but rather fitted it with a constant component. The obtained PDS and its best-fit model are shown in Figure \ref{fig:power_spectrum}. The PDS is consistent with a constant of $\sim$2 at higher frequencies, compatible with Poisson noise. We obtained a value of about 6\% for the overall root-mean-square {\it rms}. The system shows therefore little to no X-ray variability, in contrast to what typically expected for X-ray binaries in a hard or hard-intermediate state. This will be further discussed in Section \ref{sec:disc}.
%In addition, NICER observations showed the fractional X-ray emission variability progressively increased during this period, as expected for a source transitioning from the soft state, towards and then into a hard X-ray spectral state. While no X-ray quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) were detected from \source, NICER observations on MJD~58793 (ID 2200560140) showed a RMS of $\approx$25\% and a QPO-free flat-top noise PDS, breaking at $\approx 1$\,Hz (Figure~\ref{fig:swift-spectra}, bottom-right panel). 


\section{Discussion}\label{sec:disc}
%Bursts also in the high mode;
\source provides an almost unique opportunity to observe super-orbital modulations of the accretion rate over relatively short time-scales in a X-ray binary. The spectral evolution of the source during several accretion cycles has been studied in detail by \cite{Titarchuk2013} using Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, at energies higher than 3 keV. In the work presented here, thanks to the excellent effective area of \nicer\ in the soft X-ray band, we are able to investigate the system behaviour during such super-orbital modulations in the soft X-ray band for the first time. In addition, we see how the radio emission, and, therefore, the jet, evolved corresponding to these changes in the X-ray spectra. 
\subsection{The origin of the fluctuation in the Comptonisation component and the accretion flow geometry}\label{ss:spreading}
In this paper we showed how the X-ray spectral-timing parameters evolve as the systems bounces between high and low modes. According to the traditional classification scheme based on the colour-colour diagram, \source lingered in the banana state for the whole considered period, moving back and forth between the upper and the lower banana branch. Such a trend seems to reflect more an evolution in the flux rather than in the hardness value, which stays more or less constant. We indeed found that a simple model composed of a disc blackbody and a Comptonisation component was sufficient to describe the continuum in all the considered spectra. Moving along the super-orbital oscillation, however, these two components behave in a rather distinct way. The disc parameters stay more or less constant, in terms of both temperature (about 0.7-0.8 keV), inner radius (20-30 km) and normalisation. On the contrary, the Comptonisation component displays a dramatic evolution mostly in its normalisation, i.e., an almost 50\% reduction in the 0.5-10 keV flux going from high to low mode, compared to the less than 10\% drop in the disc component. Such a trend has been already spotted by \cite{Titarchuk2013} using RXTE data, although with a model slightly different than ours. A less prominent change can be also observed in the electron temperature of the corona, which seems slightly anti-correlated with the flux, i.e., going from 3 keV (high mode) to about 5 keV (low mode).  A closer inspection to the obtained best-fit parameters reveals that such an evolution is driven mostly by the normalisation, thereby the physical size, of the source of the seed photons. Such a source has been described with a black body component and associated to the innermost part of the accretion flow. In the high mode, seed photons seem to be radiated by a bigger region with respect to the low modes, i.e., the size going from about 15 km in spectra A-B to about a third of this value in spectrum C.
% Breaking down this innermost hot region into a boundary layer (BL) in-between the disc and the NS surface and a spreading layer (SL) on top of it,
We can interpret this trend making the following points: (i) in high mode, the mass-accretion rate increases as a consequence of the super-orbital modulation in the system; (ii) the energy fuelled by accretion is dissipated by a $\sim$15 km region in the BL, resulting in more photons and thereby a stronger cooling of the corona; (iii) in low mode, while the $\dot{M}$ drops along with the energy supply to the innermost regions of the system, only a fraction of the BL is remains hot enough to cool the corona by charging it with photons; (iv) with less photons injected, the corona cools down less and stays hotter. The proposed scenario is sketched in Fig. \ref{fig:interpretation}. 
We suggest that this interpretation can also explain the evolution of the iron line component (see Section \ref{ss:iron-line}). While a clear trend is visible in energy spectra, the \nicer PDS show way less variability, with no clear correlation or anti-correlation with the observed count-rate (we refer again to Fig. \ref{fig:PDS}). The fractional RMS is indeed stable at about 2-3.5\% and there is only a marginal detection ($\sim$3 $\sigma$) for low-frequency QPOs in two observations. However, it is important to point out that NICER has lower sensitivity in the hard band, i.e., above 3 keV, where high X-ray variability is expected, makes harder to assess more subtle variation in the upper banana-lower banana transitions. \\
The geometry of the accretion flow, and in particular of the hot corona, in X-ray binaries remains one of the most controversial topics in the field to date, both for accreting BHs \citep[see e.g.,][]{Connors2022} and NSs \citep[e.g.,][]{Ludlam2022}. Recently, the new X-ray spectro-polarimetry mission \emph{Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE)} \citep{Weisskopf2022} has provided a new window to study the accretion flow geometry and break the degeneracy between different scenarios explaining the same spectral-timing data. The first \ixpe studies on NS LMXBs seem to favour hot coronae located in the innermost regions of the system, with spherical or slab-like geometries \citep{Capitanio2023}, with the spreading layer being the main source of polarised photons \citep{Farinelli2023}. These results seem coherent with our proposed picture for \source . An \ixpe observational campaign has been performed between 2022 and 2023 on \source (Di Marco et al., submitted), and could serve as a testbed for the conclusions of this manuscript.


%tion of apolarization signal (in the energy range 4–8 keV) in ScoX-1 with the PolarLight (Feng et al. 2019) instrument.
%Their results, and in particular the polarization angleroughly aligned with the radio jet, favor an electroncorona located in the spreading/transition layer. Timinganalysis of these sources also supports the presence ofthe spreading layer, which may be even directly responsible of the emission of the hard component (Gilfanovet al. 2003; Revnivtsev & Gilfanov 2006). As discussedin Revnivtsev et al. (2013), on the base of the RXTEdata, the hard component of NS-LMXB spectra can bemodeled with a diluted blackbody. 
%Jayasurya+23: Hence, we propose that a thick slab-like corona above the inner part of the disc, obscuring emission from the NS surface, is responsible for the Comptonized radiation. Such a corona is cool (kTe ∼ 3 keV), optically thick (τslab ∼ 4) and located between the NS surface and inner part of accretion disc, probably covering some fraction of inner disc as well.
%On the other hand, the latitudinal extent of theSL might not be large enough to produce significant illumination of the disc resulting in a weak signal. Thiscould be one of the reasons why we could only establishan upper limit for polarization in GS 1826−238.
\subsection{What determines the jet evolution?}\label{ss:jet}
In the radio band, which is dominated by the jet emission, the source also shows dramatic changes between our observations. In the low mode (epoch C), its radio flux density is enhanced by a factor of 5 with respect to the high mode (epochs A and B) and also its spectral shape seems to change. The mode dependency of the jet in \source was already proposed by \cite{Russell2021}. In this work, for the first time, we can compare the jet evolution with the simultaneous X-rays spectral-timing properties of the source. In Section \ref{ss:spreading} we have showed the X-rays evolution during a super-orbital cycle in \source is connected to fluctuations in the boundary layer emission, going from bright to faint in the high to low mode transitions. Such a trend produces dramatic oscillations in the X-ray light curves that do not correspond to changes in the X-ray hardness of the source. During all of our observations, the source never departs from the banana track, as displayed in Fig. \ref{fig:HID}, indicating a steady spectral state. The observed evolution of the jet emission is therefore not associated with a spectral state transition and indicates a behaviour that seems markedly distinct from what is typically observed in BH and (some) NS LMXBs \citep[e.g., ][]{Fender2004,Migliari2006,MillerJones2010}, i.e., where the jet seems to be responsive to spectral state transitions. What then determines the evolution in the jet? A link with the boundary layer \citep[which was also suggested by][for the same source]{Russell2021} seems plausible, as it drives the entire evolution of the accretion flow that we observe in our X-ray observations of \source. Jet launching is typically associated with a vertically extended, optically thin and magnetised region which is generally identified as the hot corona. The temperature and the geometrical thickness of the corona change as a consequence of the interaction with the photons coming from the disc or, in NS systems, from the BL and the NS surface itself. During the high modes, the boundary layer is bright and extended and irradiates the corona more than during the low modes, making it colder and thicker. On the other hand, during low modes, the corona is charged with less photons and can therefore expand and heat. {\bf A hot, thin and extended corona is considered a key element to support jet launching according to several accretion/ejection models \citep[e.g.][]{BlandfordPayne1982,Marcel2018a}, so that the accretion flow during low modes become a more favorable environment for jet \citep[however, see][for evidence of an anti-correlation between hot coronae and bright radio jets]{Mendez2022}}.
This is also witnessed by the increment in $kT_{\rm e}$ going from A/B to C (see Tab. \ref{tab:fit_broadband}). We include this mechanism in our interpretation scheme in Fig. \ref{fig:interpretation}. In this proposed scenario, the BL takes the main role in regulating the jet properties, to such an extent that we should talk about BL-jet coupling instead of disc-jet coupling, a common term used in the context of LMXBs. An intriguing implication of this scenario is that jet quenching can occur beyond a certain X-ray luminosity but within the same spectral state. Disentangling jet suppression from spectral state transition could be key to explain why some NS LMXBs do not quench the jet during the transition to the soft state \citep[][]{Migliari2004, Migliari2011}. Furthermore, a BL-jet coupling could be operating in other systems, even very different from \source, for instance jet launching in the dwarf nova SS Cyg was found to be possibly connected with the switching on of the boundary layer \citep{Russell2016}.

A similar situation is of course not applicable to BH LMXBs, where a BL can not form. In addition, BLs may also not form in other NS LMXBs where the disc is truncated very far away from the NS surface. This could be the case for pulsating LMXBs, like AMXPs \citep[][]{DiSalvo2020}, where the disc is typically truncated far away from the NS surface, possibly because of the magnetospheric pressure in proximity of the compact object \citep{Degenaar2017, Bult2021,Marino2022}. Of note is that AMXPs are remarkably radio bright, sometimes as much as BH LMXBs at the same X-ray luminosity \citep{Russell2018}. The role of the BL could then be crucial to explain the differences observed in jets between NS and BH transients and also the large scatter in radio luminosity within the NS LMXB population \citep[e.g., ][]{Tetarenko2016}.


\subsection{An evolving iron line?}\label{ss:iron-line}
Ultra-compact XRBs have usually weak or absent Fe K$\alpha$ lines \citep[see, e.g., ][]{Koliopanos2021}, probably due to the material transferred from the highly evolved companion star being intrinsically Iron poor \citep[notable exceptions, however, can be found in][]{VanDenEijnden2018,Ludlam2019}. In the case of \source, the Fe K line has been reported only by a number of studies \citep{Cackett2008,Titarchuk2013}, while other observations did not reveal such features \citep{Costantini2012}. The presence of the line has been also found to be model-dependent and to be also potentially described by a combination of absorption edges \citep{Mondal2016} . In this manuscript, residuals due to a line-like feature were present in most of the data sets considered, i.e., including data from different instruments such as \nicer , \nustar and \astrosat . In order to check different origins of the feature, we tested both a model using two absorption edges \citep[as in ][]{Mondal2016} and another model including a \textsc{diskline} component, finding in the second approach an apparently more effective way to describe the residuals. We thereby conclude that we detected the Fe K line in the \source , although not with the same significance in all pointings. Most notably, going from broadband spectra A-B to C, the significance of the \textsc{diskline} component drops from about 6$\sigma$ to 4$\sigma$, suggesting an instrinsic evolution of the feature along with the evolution of the continuum. In the framework of our proposed scenario for the X-rays emission during the accretion cycle, the weakening of the Fe line in the lower banana part of the cycle could be connected to the drastic reduction in the Comptonisation component normalization. As the strength of this component drops, the amount of radiation hitting the disc and arising reflection drops as well, making the Fe K line weaker and harder to detect. We propose thereby that the Fe line could be a transient feature in \source , possibly explaining why only some authors reported its presence in their X-rays spectral studies of the system.

%Interestingly, the line was not detected when the 4U 1820−30 was in high mode which may suggest a correlation between the mode and the presence of emission lines, as for compact jets. The lack of detection in Costan- tini et al., 2012, was possibly due to the low expo- sure (just 2 ks) because the EPIC-pn was operated in full-frame mode with central pixels masked. Longer exposures will enable detection of the iron line, which is intrinsically weak.

\section{Conclusions}

In this paper, we have presented the results of the 2022 multi-wavelength campaign on the ultra-compact X-ray binary \source , using X-rays (\nicer , \nustar and \astrosat) and radio (ATCA) observatories. Throughout this campaign, we were able to follow how the spectral/timing behavior of the accretion flow and the jet properties evolve in tandem, something rarely seen in NS XRBs. During the surveyed period, the source went through its typical low and high modes, showing a X-ray flux oscillation amplitude of about 40\%. Despite such a strong variability, the source lingered in the banana state and did not show dramatic spectral changes throughout this cycle. Accordingly, the aperiodic X-ray variability shows little to no evolution, with the fractional R.M.S. estimated to be around 2-4\% in all \nicer observations. A model including a Comptonisation spectrum, the disc multi-colour blackbody emission and the reflection component worked well in describing the broadband \nicer+\nustar and \astrosat spectra and the single \nicer observations as well. We showed that among these components, the Comptonisation spectrum shows the most dramatic variability, while the disc component is relatively stable. The results of our analysis suggest that modulations in the amplitude of the Comptonisation spectral component are indeed driving such variability, following the very same pattern observed in the X-ray light curve. These modulations suggest an energy flow going from a more extended region in high mode, i.e., the boundary layer, from a more confined region in the low mode, i.e., the NS surface. Furthermore, the hot corona also changes in response to this trend, becoming colder in the high mode as more radiation is pumped into it by the innermost regions of the accretion flow. Meanwhile, the jet evolved dramatically in the three observations presented here, brightening considerably during the low mode, coupled with a change in the radio spectrum. We propose that the jet is responding to the changes in the corona, becoming respectively stronger (weaker) as the corona becomes hotter (colder). Ultimately, we suggest that the jet evolution is then driven by the radiation emitted from the BL in an anti-correlation pattern where the jet switches on as the BL switches off. Such a BL-jet (anti-)coupling could be acting also in other NS LMXBs and might in part explain the complex phenomenology of matter ejection in accreting NSs. In order to confirm the above scenario and pinpoint the exact moment where the jet properties evolve, a more detailed look at the radio evolution during this cycle is required (Russell et al., in preparation).
