Electron energy loss spectra of four ionic liquids revealed a number of excited states, including triplet states. A solution of a dye in an ionic liquid showed an energy-loss band of the solute, but not in all ionic liquids. 2D spectra reveal state-to-state information (given resonance to given final state) and are shown to be an interesting means to gain insight into dynamics of nuclear motion in resonances. Absolute cross sections for pyrimidine are reported as a function of scattering angle and as a function of electron energy. They reveal resonant structure which was reproduced very nicely by R-matrix calculations. The calculation provided an assignment of the resonances which reveals common patterns in compounds containing double bonds.},

The calculations were carried out using the discrete momentum representation (DMR) method. We solved the two-channel Lippmann–Schwinger equation in the momentum space. The interaction between the scattered electron and the target molecule is described by the exact static-exchange potential. Correlation–polarization forces were included by a simple local density functional theory potential of Perdew and Zunger (1981 Phys. Rev. B 23 5048). The cross sections calculated in this way agree very well with our measurement and with other more recent experimental data, but are larger than some older experimental and theoretical results.},

Experimentally{,} we utilize electron energy loss spectroscopy which reveals the resonance positions by monitoring the excitation functions for vibrationally inelastic electron scattering. Four resonances are visible in the spectra{,} centered around 0.36 eV{,} 4.1{,} 5.3 and 7.3 eV. Theoretically{,} we explore the resonant states by using the regularized analytical continuation method. A very good agreement with the experiment is obtained for low-lying resonances{,} however{,} the computational method becomes unstable for higher-lying states. The lowest shape resonance (2Πu) is independently explored by the complex adsorbing potential method. In the experiment{,} this resonance is manifested by a pronounced boomerang structure. We show that the naive picture of viewing NCCN as a pseudodihalogen and focusing only on the CC stretch is invalid.},

  abstract = {The effective Hamiltonian method for nuclear reactions described in an earlier paper with the same title, part I, is generalized so as to include all possible reaction types, as well as the effects arising from the identity of particles. The principal device employed, as in part I, is the projection operator which selects the open channel components of the wave function. It is found that the formal structure of part I providing a unified description for direct and compound nuclear reactions including the coupled equation description for direct reactions remains valid in this wider context. A Kapur-Peierls expansion may also be readily obtained. The concept of channel radii is not needed nor is any decomposition of the wave function for the system into angular momentum eigenstates required, so that the expressions for transition amplitudes and widths are invariant with respect to the angular momentum coupling scheme. Since the open channels can only be defined in an asymptotic sense, the corresponding projection operators are not unique. As a consequence the projection operator method has a flexibility which in the first place is consonant with the wide range of phenomena which can occur in nuclear reactions and in the second place can effectively exploit an intuitive understanding of the phenomena. Example of projection operators are obtained including one which leads to the Wigner-Eisenbud formalism, another which is appropriate for the stripping reaction, and, finally, one which takes the Pauli exclusion principle into account. Note that explicit representations of the projection operators are not required for the development of general formal results but are necessary if, eventually, quantitative calculations are made.},

  abstract = {A review is given of the development of the projection-operator formalism of Feshbach towards a comprehensive theory of resonance and threshold effects in electron-molecule collisions. The definition and explicit construction of the appropriate projectors is discussed. The threshold behavior of the singularities of the analytically continued fixed-nuclei electron-molecule scattering matrix is analyzed in order to characterize threshold effects in vibrational excitation by electron impact and dissociative electron attachment. The theory of the dynamics of electron-molecule collision complexes (vibration, dissociation, and autodetachment) is developed, using the methods of time-independent scattering theory as well as a time-dependent wave-packet description. The present stage of development of the theory is illustrated by the review of a few representative applications.},
