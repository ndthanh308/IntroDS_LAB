	abstract = {A major goal of developing high-precision control of many-body quantum systems is to realize their potential as quantum computers. A substantial obstacle to this is the extreme fragility of quantum systems to {\textquotedblleft}decoherence{\textquotedblright} from environmental noise and other control limitations. Although quantum computation is possible if the noise affecting the quantum system satisfies certain conditions, existing methods for noise characterization are intractable for present multibody systems. We introduce a technique based on symmetrization that enables direct experimental measurement of some key properties of the decoherence affecting a quantum system. Our method reduces the number of experiments required from exponential to polynomial in the number of subsystems. The technique is demonstrated for the optimization of control over nuclear spins in the solid state.},

Let A1 be the full algebra of linear operators on the n-dimensional Hilbert space H1, and let A2 be the full algebra of linear operators on the m-dimensional Hilbert space H2. Let L(A1,A2) denote the complex spaceof linear maps from A1 to A2 and S denotes the cone of all T ϵ L(A1,A2 which send positive semidefinite operators from A1 to positive semidefinite operators from A2. The aim of this paper is to present a necessary and sufficient condition for a transformation in L(A1, A2) to be in the cone S, and to preserve trace of the operators.}

	journal = {New Journal of Physics},
	abstract = {Quantum state tomography on a d-dimensional system demands resources that grow rapidly with d. They may be reduced by using model selection to tailor the number of parameters in the model (i.e., the size of the density matrix). Most model selection methods typically rely on a test statistic and a null theory that describes its behavior when two models are equally good. Here, we consider the loglikelihood ratio. Because of the positivity constraint ρ ≥ 0, quantum state space does not generally satisfy local asymptotic normality (LAN), meaning the classical null theory for the loglikelihood ratio (the Wilks theorem) should not be used. Thus, understanding and quantifying how positivity affects the null behavior of this test statistic is necessary for its use in model selection for state tomography. We define a new generalization of LAN, metric-projected LAN, show that quantum state space satisfies it, and derive a replacement for the Wilks theorem. In addition to enabling reliable model selection, our results shed more light on the qualitative effects of the positivity constraint on state tomography.}

We show that by using five different parameter settings of the electric field of the laser it is possible two reconstruct the state, and obtain the unknown spontaneous emission rate and dipole moment of the atom.},

For a given fixed average error rate, coherent noise mechanisms will generally lead to a larger worst-case error than incoherent noise. We show that the coherence of a noise source can be quantified by the unitarity, which we relate to the average change in purity averaged over input pure states. We then show that the unitarity can be efficiently estimated using a protocol based on randomized benchmarking that is efficient and robust to state-preparation and measurement errors. We also show that the unitarity provides a lower bound on the optimal achievable gate infidelity under a given noisy process.}

abstract={Predicting the properties of complex, large-scale quantum systems is essential for developing quantum technologies. We present an efficient method for constructing an approximate classical description of a quantum state using very few measurements of the state. This description, called a `classical shadow', can be used to predict many different properties; order {\$}{\$}{\{}{\backslash}mathrm{\{}log{\}}{\}}{\backslash},(M){\$}{\$}measurements suffice to accurately predict M different functions of the state with high success probability. The number of measurements is independent of the system size and saturates information-theoretic lower bounds. Moreover, target properties to predict can be selected after the measurements are completed. We support our theoretical findings with extensive numerical experiments. We apply classical shadows to predict quantum fidelities, entanglement entropies, two-point correlation functions, expectation values of local observables and the energy variance of many-body local Hamiltonians. The numerical results highlight the advantages of classical shadows relative to previously known methods.},

  abstract={If quantum information processors are to fulfill their potential, the diverse errors that affect them must be understood and suppressed. But errors typically fluctuate over time, and the most widely used tools for characterizing them assume static error modes and rates. This mismatch can cause unheralded failures, misidentified error modes, and wasted experimental effort. Here, we demonstrate a spectral analysis technique for resolving time dependence in quantum processors. Our method is fast, simple, and statistically sound. It can be applied to time-series data from any quantum processor experiment. We use data from simulations and trapped-ion qubit experiments to show how our method can resolve time dependence when applied to popular characterization protocols, including randomized benchmarking, gate set tomography, and Ramsey spectroscopy. In the experiments, we detect instability and localize its source, implement drift control techniques to compensate for this instability, and then demonstrate that the instability has been suppressed.},

abstract = "In many experiments on microscopic quantum systems, it is implicitly assumed that when a macroscopic procedure or “instruction” is repeated many times – perhaps in different contexts – each application results in the same microscopic quantum operation. But in practice, the microscopic effect of a single macroscopic instruction can easily depend on its context. If undetected, this can lead to unexpected behavior and unreliable results. Here, we design and analyze several tests to detect context-dependence. They are based on invariants of matrix products, and while they can be as data intensive as quantum process tomography, they do not require tomographic reconstruction, and are insensitive to imperfect knowledge about the experiments. We also construct a measure of how unitary (reversible) an operation is, and show how to estimate the volume of physical states accessible by a quantum operation."

  abstract = "In spin-based nanosystems for quantum information processing,
              electron spin qubits are subject to decoherence due to their
              interactions with nuclear spin environments. In this paper, we
              present an exact master equation for a central spin-1/2 system in
              time-dependent external fields and coupled to a spin-half bath in
              terms of hyperfine interaction. The master equation provides a
              unified description for free and controlled dynamics of the
              central spin and is formally independent of the details and size
              of spin environments. Different from the previous approaches, the
              master equation remains exact even in the presence of external
              control fields. Using the parameters for realistic nanosystems
              with nonzero nuclear spins, such as GaAs, we investigate the
              Overhauser's effect on the decoherence dynamics of the central
              spin under different distributions of bath-spin frequencies and
              system-bath coupling strengths. Furthermore, we apply the leakage
              elimination operator, in a nonperturbative manner, to this system
              to suppress the decoherence induced by hyperfine interaction.",

              the subject of considerable attention due to its relevance for
              spin-based quantum computation using semiconductor quantum dots.
              Independent control of the nuclear spin bath using nuclear
              magnetic resonance techniques and dynamic nuclear polarization
              using the central spin itself offer unique possibilities for

              the coherence and controlled manipulation of the central spin.

              experiments that have explored this central spin problem using
              semiconductor quantum dots. We focus on the interaction between
              10(4)-10(6) nuclear spins and a spin of a single electron or

  abstract = "The addressing of a particular qubit within a quantum register is
              a key pre-requisite for scalable quantum computing. In general,
              executing a quantum gate with a single qubit, or a subset of
              qubits, affects the quantum states of all other qubits. This
              reduced fidelity of the whole-quantum register could prevent the
              application of quantum error correction protocols and thus
              preclude scalability. Here we demonstrate addressing of
              individual qubits within a quantum byte (eight qubits) and
              measure the error induced in all non-addressed qubits
              (cross-talk) associated with the application of single-qubit
              gates. The quantum byte is implemented using microwave-driven
              hyperfine qubits of (171)Yb(+) ions confined in a Paul trap
              augmented with a magnetic gradient field. The measured cross-talk
              is on the order of 10(-5) and therefore below the threshold
              commonly agreed sufficient to efficiently realize fault-tolerant

  abstract = "Quantum computers can solve certain problems more efficiently
              than any possible conventional computer. Small quantum algorithms
              have been demonstrated on multiple quantum computing platforms,
              many specifically tailored in hardware to implement a particular
              algorithm or execute a limited number of computational paths.
              Here we demonstrate a five-qubit trapped-ion quantum computer
              that can be programmed in software to implement arbitrary quantum
              algorithms by executing any sequence of universal quantum logic
              gates. We compile algorithms into a fully connected set of gate
              operations that are native to the hardware and have a mean
              fidelity of 98 per cent. Reconfiguring these gate sequences
              provides the flexibility to implement a variety of algorithms
              without altering the hardware. As examples, we implement the
              Deutsch-Jozsa and Bernstein-Vazirani algorithms with average

              fidelities of 62 and 84 per cent, respectively. This small
              quantum computer can be scaled to larger numbers of qubits within
              a single register, and can be further expanded by connecting
              several such modules through ion shuttling or photonic quantum
