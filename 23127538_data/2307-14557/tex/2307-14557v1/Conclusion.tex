In summary, this paper proposes a novel PMM accelerator based on XBA-type CIM for accelerating the most time-consuming part of lattice-based cryptography algorithms. The proposed X-Poly design achieves 3.1 MOP/s throughput and offers 200$\times$ latency improvement compared to CPU-based implementations. It also achieves 3.9$\times$ throughput per area improvements compared with the SOTA CIM accelerators. The suitability of NTT-based solutions for CIM-based PMM acceleration is evaluated, and a novel bit mapping technique is proposed to reduce area and energy overhead. PE-level optimization is conducted to increase memory utilization and support different scales of problems with a fixed number of XBAs.
