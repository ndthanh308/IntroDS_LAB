  "abstract": "Many planning formalisms allow for mixing numeric with Boolean effects. However, most of these formalisms are undecidable. In this paper, we will analyze possible causes for this undecidability by studying the number of different occurrences of actions, an approach that proved useful for metric fluents before. We will start by reformulating a numeric planning problem known as restricted tasks as a search problem. We will then show how an NP-complete fragment of numeric planning can be found by using heuristics. To achieve this, we will develop the idea of multi-valued partial order plans, a least committing compact representation for (sequential and parallel) plans. Finally, we will study optimization techniques for this representation to incorporate soft preconditions.",
