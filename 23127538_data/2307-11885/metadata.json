  "abstract": "We obtain scaling and local limit results for large random Young tableaux of fixed shape $λ^0$ via the asymptotic analysis of a determinantal point process due to Gorin and Rahman (2019). More precisely, we prove:\n  (1) an explicit description of the limiting surface of a uniform random Young tableau of shape $λ^0$, based on solving a complex-valued polynomial equation;\n  (2) a simple criteria to determine if the limiting surface is continuous in the whole domain;\n  (3) and a local limit result in the bulk of a random Poissonized Young tableau of shape $λ^0$.\n  Our results have several consequences, for instance: they lead to explicit formulas for the limiting surface of $L$-shaped tableaux, generalizing the results of Pittel and Romik (2007) for rectangular shapes; they imply that the limiting surface for $L$-shaped tableaux is discontinuous for almost-every $L$-shape; and they give a new one-parameter family of infinite random Young tableaux, constructed from the so-called random infinite bead process.",
