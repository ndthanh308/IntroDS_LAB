abstract = {Pedestrian Attribute Recognition (PAR) is an important task in surveillance video analysis. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end hierarchical deep learning approach to PAR. The proposed network introduces semantic segmentation into PAR and formulates it as a multi-task learning problem, which brings in pixel-level supervision in feature learning for attribute localization. According to the spatial properties of local and global attributes, we present a two stage learning mechanism to decouple coarse attribute localization and fine attribute recognition into successive phases within a single model, which strengthens feature learning. Besides, we design an attribute relationship attention module to efficiently capture and emphasize the latent relations among different attributes, further enhancing the discriminative power of the feature. Extensive experiments are conducted and very competitive results are reached on the RAP and PETA databases, indicating the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed approach.},
